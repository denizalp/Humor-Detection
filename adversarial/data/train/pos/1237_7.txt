Nordy's, I love your shoes, I love your FREE shipping policy on your online website, I love your phone app (my bank account doesn't though), and I love the men's department for purchasing presents for my hubby.\n\nThis particular Nordstrom store is one of my favorites. Is it because the store is in sunny Phoenix (oops, I mean Scottsdale) versus dreary Seattle or dreadful Spokane? Maybe. Really, the merchandise seems to be virtually the same. The outstanding customer service is the same. It must be the blue skies of Arizona!
