I have to say this is not my favorite location. I find the one in Chandler much better.\nStaff is far more attentive in Chandler location,as well as more knowledgable about the food they carry.\nThe food even seems better there.\nWe had always wanted to try this location, for something new.\nWe really like the one in Chandler so we thought this one would be just as good if not better.\nSad disappointment.  Not enough BBQ sause,food was not really hot, just warm. Plus, we had to keep asking for refills on our drinks. \nI cannot see any reason to come back to this location.
