My girlfriend was like \"Hey! Wanna sign up for Bikram Yoga with me?\" I was like \"Have you done it before?\" & she said \"No.\" but I signed up for it anyway. At the time, I was doing bootcamp and running 3 miles, 3xs a week. On the day of my first class, I drank about 2 liters of water prior to class to prepare myself. The class itself is miserable. It's hot. It's humid. I hate those combinations. The class is also LONG. As a parent, I hate not being able to put my kids to bed to work out? What? I can go on a run in 30 minutes whenever I want rather than be gone for 2 hours (90 minute class + 30 minute drive there & back). \n\nThe poses are not that difficult. I never had to sit down or stop, or not do a pose. I just think this should be considered lazy yoga. The yoga I'm used to, you're holding yourself in plank for what seems like an eternity until your core is burning, your toes are screaming, and your arms are shaking. Here, you do a pose, then lay down. Do a pose, then stop, lay down. It's just the heat you have to beat. Every class I've been to, I think someone has walked out. There is always someone who sits down at least half the time because they think they're going to die. There is no music. The instructor doesn't do the set with you, she just talks you through it. The room smells so bad. Especially when you're laying in savasana on your stomach. I came to 5 classes within a 2 1\/2 week span. It is just not my scene. I want a fast and rapid work out where I feel like I burned a bazillion calories and that my heart is going to burst out of my chest. This is time consuming, and kind of lazy for me.
