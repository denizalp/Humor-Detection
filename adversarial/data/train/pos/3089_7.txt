Yay for Double Down!!  \nIt was a quiet Monday night when I finally got to hit up the infamous Double Down... The last night of my honeymoon trip.. we figured, why not stay up all night drinking before an early flight home.  So Double Down hit the spot perfectly.  \n\nI was intrigued by the Ass Juice drink and bought several for myself and hubs, along with other drink varieties and shots... I got pretty sloshed.  \nThe DJ (the jukebox was down for the night) came up to us to take requests and played the best of the best punk rock!  I was the only fool dancing around singing to Bro Hymn at 2 in the morning but it was a moment I'll never forget.  \n\nI love the decor... stickers on every inch of the wall.  I loved the signs... \"if you throw up, you clean up\"   \"Shut up and drink\"  etc.   And the photo booth just topped it all off!!  I was so drunk my eyes are pretty much closed in all the photos I appear in... but I will keep these souvenirs forever!   It happened in Vegas, yo! \nThe TV above the bar was playing some weird cartoon the whole time, which was pretty cool for moments of dizziness.  :)\n\nI saw a review that said they don't take credit cards... but they took ours. \n\nWe visit Vegas often enough that Double Down will soon become a regular spot for us.   I am so excited to have hit up one of the legendary punk dive bars!
