We found this mexican restaurant by accident while walking down the Las Vegas blvd. Since there was a long queue of peole waiting to order their food we thought: that must be a good place to have diner. The menue is in spanish with only a few english translations. Depending on what you want to eat you have to line up either at counter 1, 2 or 3. With zero spanish knowledge I mamaged to order to tacos with spicy pork. The tacos were super delicious with plenty of fresh herbs and a spicy sauce. Two tacos were about 5$ and definitely worth the price.
