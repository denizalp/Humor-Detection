The first time I tired this place was thru delivery to my work, I ordered the Garlic Shrimp, it came with 4 tiny shrimp and a big ball of rice stuck together. My fellow coworkers didn't seem impressed with their meals either (we usually order from Thai BBQ, but I'm not a huge fan of that place either). \n\nSecond try, we went in for lunch, ordered the Mint Chicken lunch special, $1 extra for brown rice, I loved the soup that it came with more than my meal. Their spice level I 1-5, I ordered 3 and didn't get a hint of heat. 3 spoonfuls of hike sauce later and I still didn't rate any heat. \n\nDon't come in for lunch if you're in a hurry, lunch service was really slow. Not my fav Thai place in town.
