Best pizza around! Although when you get this pizza to go it's not that wonderful, gets soggy and just nothing like the fresh out of the oven!\n\nOur server Austin is why it's only a 4 star. He was good, but didn't check up on us seemed like he was having a rough day. Service was just slow compared to normal.\n\nPizza and drinks are delicious! We get the white garlic pizza with onions, meatballs, and ricotta. Don't forget to ask your server for the garlic salt, Parmesan, and oregano to put on top of your already delicious pizza! They don't have ranch, which I think is great so you can taste the food!\n\nBloody Mary here is amazing I like it extra spicy! Still slowly trying out the rest of the drinks but overall we love this pizza spot and we will be back!
