I had a very good experience with storing my furniture at this storage center. The facility was clean and well taken care of. Nadia was very helpful with finding the right size for my things.  She took extra care in telling me how things work. The paperwork was clear and helpful. When I moved my furniture out of storage, she was helpful and the move out was as good as the move in. I recommend this storage center highly.\nCecelia H
