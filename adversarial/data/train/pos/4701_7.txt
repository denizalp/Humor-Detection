24 HOURS 7 DAYS A WEEK!! \n\nHONESTLY this place was probably the only Korean place that I was able to eat at when I FIRST moved out to Vegas.... the place is big & they also have a glass private area if you have a large party as well.\n\nThe service is quick & yet sometimes they can be overwhelmed but they are definitely under staffed sometimes. We know most of the workers.. so they always attend to us in the best way... but HONESTLY don't expect that sweet timely attentive & conversating expectations you would get at an American resteraunts... these ladies are there to get your order & get your food out as fast as possible..... \n\nWe came here very often when we didn't feel like cooking BBQ at home & didn't want to clean up the grease mess. \n\nThe quality of meat is good & I would have to say we get very full. \n\nTHE KING $83.95- combination of meats probably the largest portion....  sirloin beef, beef short ribs, marinated beef short ribs, beef brisket, soy bean soup, steamed egg, combination veggies, soju bottle. You also get rive if you ask & all the BANCHAN is good... like actually good side dishes. \n\nThey have happy hour everyday where you get 20% off your bill after 11pm! We always eat that late too especially when we get off work =]
