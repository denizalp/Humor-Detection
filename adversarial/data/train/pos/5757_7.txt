When you're in Vegas & want to get away from the madness on the strip & take refreshing break from Buffets....eat at DJ K Korean BBQ!\n\nWent her for a friend's Karen's B-Day Dinner, and left full, and buzzed, haha!! We took up one of the back rooms (good thing cause after 6 Soju Shots, & 3 Hite Beers later, we were loud & obnoxious). \n\nLoved the food, the BBQ Beef, Kalbi & Bolgogi that we ate, along with all the side dishes were delicious! Even the Seaweed Salad was bomb! Had Tofu pancake for the 1st time there too, and it was great! \n\nThe cool thing is this place is open 24 Hours, so you can even hit this spot up after a club or whenever you feel like it. I tripped out that their Happy Hour starts at 11pm....so you know they got it crackin' late night. \n\nCheck it out for yourself, and check out my pics that are attached. (Esp the pic of my boy Chris, he's crunked!) haha
