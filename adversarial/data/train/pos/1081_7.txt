Three words for you: PIG HEAD NACHOS.\n\nI realize that this will not be a selling feature for some, but for me, it sealed the deal. Crispy tortilla chips with sour cream, guacamole and jalape√±os with a roasted fried pig's head! They pull off a lot of the meat for you and there's a tangy vinegar sauce that adds some more seasoning. I ate the eyeball!\n\nWe also had the scotch egg and the chicharonnes. Proper bar food. Proper beer food.\n\nAgain, to echo my review of the original barhop, I am not a beer drinker, so I feel a little ripped off here. cocktails are small and very expensive. Wine is mostly local. But the server was nice enough to let me taste before I ordered. Overall the service was excellent with the exception of a rush that happened around 6:30, but he was patient with out eccentric friend who asked him if he wanted to hear a story. (Every server's nightmare... of course he doesn't want to hear your story-- he he's BUSY and probably doesn't care, anyway.) I expected some of the hipster-twattitude here, but thee was none. Of this, I am greatly appreciative.\n\nThe atmosphere was clean, aesthetically pleasing and overall it was a great experience.\n\nI am curious about there being 3 bouncers at the door?? Really?\n\nAnyway, a solid stop for a Friday after work. The place fills up fast. Don't bet on getting a table without a bit of a wait.
