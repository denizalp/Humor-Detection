This place was dead on a Friday night.  The sushi was just a-ok.  We wanted to order the toro and since it was listed as market price, we asked our server how much it would cost.  She told us \"no more than $20\".  So we shrugged our shoulders, said, not bad...let's try it!  We ordered 2 orders of the toro.  When it came time for our bill to arrive, she was completely wrong!  It was $40 EACH for it!  When we asked her about it, she responded, \"I wrong.\"  Ughhhh.
