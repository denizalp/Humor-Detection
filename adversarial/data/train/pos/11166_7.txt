I wish I could give no stars. Amy you're a crazy freak and when the doors close everyone will be laughing at you!!! I stopped by to check this place out while out of town just because of the show! These two are idiots. I tried the fig pizza. Soggy, disgusting and just unpleasant to the eye. The burgers taste like Walmart patties. By the way if you call that hummus you're an idiot! Amy couldn't cook if her life depended on it. Please everyone stop going to see if its actually like the show showed us. They are thieves with no taste buds. As soon as we stop supporting them they'll go away and then maybe Amy can take a cooking class!
