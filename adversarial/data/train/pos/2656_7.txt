Let me just say straight off the bat; yes, the prices are expensive for what it is. But keep in mind, all restaurants and foods are usually overly priced on The Strip. \n\nBesides that, food was delicious! Boyfriend and I wanted to try the brussel sprouts chips but they were out for the day. -__- what!? awwwwww......man! So we got gyoza dumplings and the seabass sliders (one order came with two) as appetizers. The sliders were my boyfriend's favorite item of the night. The tartar-type sauce had a kick to it. The seabass was crispy. We would definitely order that again.\n\nWe decided to order three kinds of sushi. As a staple, we always get an order of spicy tuna roll at any sushi\/Japanese restaurant we go to. This one here, ehhhhh....it was only alright. We could definitely do without. Average and I've had spicier, better ones at other places. \nWe also order the Shima roll: shrimp on top of spicy tuna, cilantro and avocado. It looked like it was wrapped in soy paper. And we got the Baked Lobster roll in a creamy miso sauce. Both those rolls will definitely be a repeat.\n\nOnly reason why I gave it 4 stars (really a 4 1\/2 star review) was because we really wanted to try the brussel sprout chips. If they had it available that night, this might have been a perfect 5 star rating. Plus I know the prices here might turn some people off. We got two drinks, two appetitzers, 3 sushi rolls and our total was a little over $100.00. Overall, I have no hesitation to come back here (if I want to splurge on sushi).
