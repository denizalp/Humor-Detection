280. This was my last dinner before I flew out. If you're staying at Mandalay Bay, this is a convenient place with little to no wait time.\n\nChile relleno was a bit salty. But +1 for fulfilling our personal request; they were able to prepare the spicy black bean dip, normally available for lunch.  My favorite was the caramelized plantains. Good selection of vegetarian items. Server seemed too caught up, didn't see her around much.\n\nStandard Mexican food acceptable for Vegas. Sounds like their brunch might be a better choice.
