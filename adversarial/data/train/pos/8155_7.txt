WHEN I start eating chicken again, the first place I eat it will be at Chalet Bar B-Q. Swiss Chalet and St-Hubert roast up a poor man's rotisserie chicken in comparison.\n\nI used to live about ten doors down from CBBQ and some weeks I'd eat here NIGHTLY, and that was as a one-step-from-hobodom McGill student. The quarter chicken dinner is something like $2 or $3 cheaper than at Swiss Chalet and the chalet sauce yields the perfect penetration for fry and chicken dipping.\n\nThe servers, quintessentially Quebecois, are your typical burgundy & spiked haired, poorly aging (sunscreen, people!!) older ladies and may have been working here since the place opened in 1944. They may or may not speak English but you know what you're getting from the moment you walk in the door so what does it matter. Decor is nothing to get excited about - it's outdated and musty and you may actually forget it's the 21st century as you mow down on roasted chicken.\n\nLike Swiss Chalet they have a separate takeaway counter. Worth the drive to Montreal!
