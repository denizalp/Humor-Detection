Garish over sized prices combined with sub standard low quality furniture describes the dump. \n\nI think the plan is to sell high to buy low. Show some one a large great piece out of their price range and have them settle on a cheaper low quality item.\n\nI was not impressed with the quality of many items I looked at in this store, from drawers that had butt joints and no guide rails, to cheaply upholstered couches.  \n\nOne of the other quirks about this place is their packages. They are not an option. If you just want a sofa sans love seat, you will be buying both anyway. The same goes for bedroom sets etc.\n\nDespite a large amount of sales staff who I even heard saying to one another that \"there are too many of us in this area\"  I did not receive any assistance. \n\nEach item lists two prices, a retail and the dump price. I don't know where their retail prices come from but they are over inflated to make their price look good which often it is not.  \n\nLook at the photo of the return policy it seems a bit shady. \n\nNot the best furniture, or prices, or selection flexibility\n\n** I just dove by a small sign about 2 miles away from the store labeled TheDump pickup and delivery center, so note if you do buy things from the store you do not get them at the store.\n\nThe deception continues the \"$100 free gift card\" was not a gift card at all, it was a Coupon with many terms and conditions. I wonder if calling it a gift card was even legal.
