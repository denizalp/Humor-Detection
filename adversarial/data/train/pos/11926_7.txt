Awwwww yeah, Dollar Tree! If you like buying kitschy crap, then head to this place post-haste. Their Halloween section is out in full force, so this is the time to grab those skull-light-string things and skeleton wall hangings. They also have some pretty crazy faux Precious Moments figurines that involve little bubble-headed children praying, raking leaves, making brownies, the whole spiel. Aunt Edna would love it! (Also: Sonny Chiba movies for a buck. KICK ASS.)
