Melt, located on the Northwest corner of N 5th & E Garfield is in the middle of a super hipster artsy neighborhood.  There is art by local artists hanging on the walls inside and more local artists' work spray painted on the outside of neighborhood buildings.  No, I'm not suggesting that this is a grungy graffiti bombed neighborhood, it's definitely underground hipster.  It is located inside an old house, and you're greeted out front by a bright retro neon sign.  It is just too cute and very welcoming.\n\nThere is an area to sit and enjoy your tasty treats outside the building, but I was grabbing mine to go on my way out of town.  Melt sells a variety of clever flavors of locally produced ice cream, though the way it is displayed in the cases reminds one of gelato.\n\nMelt gives free tastes!!!!  I decided to try the cucumber as it sounded like such a unique flavor.  I could feel the texture of fresh cucumber on my tongue and the taste was lifht and fresh.  I also tasted the fried ice cream flavor which had a nice war cinnamon flavor to it.\n\nI finally settle on ordering the super farm chocolate which tastes like a lot like Nutella and looks like a rose in a Chinese takeout box with a fortune cookie on top.  Melt sells super delicious ice cream, but with ever purchase you also get a little taste of the indy arts district, free of charge.  \n\nAnd who could possible put a price tag on that.\n\nThe ice cream is pricey, but totally worth the expense.
