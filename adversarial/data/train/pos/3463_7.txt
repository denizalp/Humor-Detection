Always my favorite thing to do in Vegas. 3 drinks and 2 shots, 2 fur coats and a hat all included in the $79 offer. Funny story.. they remodeled this location and there's kind of a secluded area; My bf and I were sitting there and the bartender forgot we were in there.. and we thought we were locked in.. and I assumed we would freeze to death.. finally realized we could get out and the bartender was shocked to see us walk out. such a fun.\n\nGo, enjoy being cold, & order the snowman :D
