Incredible 54 flavors of artisan made gelato & sorbeto. Highly recommend their Blood Orange and Grapefruit combo for citrus lovers. Their flavors pack a punch of flavor, and those citrus flavors were oh so refreshing! They're open late - close at 1AM - so for those roaming near the strip with gelato cravings... this should be your go to spot! It is quite pricey though, ended up costing $20 for a two scoop cone and Affogato! Located inside Palazzo Hotel.
