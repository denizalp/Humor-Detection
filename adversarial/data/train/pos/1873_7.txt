Wandering Montreal and looking for a beer, we found Eggspectation. Pitchers of Rickards went down well and with a nice Caesar salad. Their menu is focused mostly on eggs (duh) but they offer salads and burgers too.\n\nOutside seating has a great view of the square where the Jazz Festival sets up, so if you want to enjoy that, go ahead. We sat inside with a view of the television so that we could watch the Euro Cup final and drink beer.\n\nVery pleasant waitress, a chicken Caesar salad and a delicious pitcher of Richard's White beer later, we were off. Good time, I would recommend.
