Initially I had intended my review of ESSpa to be at least four stars. I received a complimentary foot and ankle massage and was thrilled with both the service and the atmosphere of the location. The massage therapist was top-notch and the overall impression I had of the place was very positive. In fact, I hadn't found a place of their caliber since I'd lived in Chicago.\n\nI had a second session with the same MT and scheduled another for yesterday with the intention of seeking out other types of services in the future.\n\nHowever, I was not informed, except by a casual mention, that the MT I was scheduled for was no longer there until I arrived and was dressed for the sauna. Considering I had specifically requested that MT, I was more than a bit annoyed and frustrated. \n\nUltimately they comped me the session, and, while the MT they assigned to me was competent, she was not skilled in the same methods as the original MT I had expected.\n\nThe owner of the spa came to speak with me before I left and informed me that she did not believe it was necessary to advise customers of such changes. \n\nI disagree. If I, as a customer, expect a service to be performed by a specific person and am paying for that service, the very least the business can do when there's a change is to inform me of that change.\n\nIf I were to hire a maid service and regularly had the same maid coming to my home, I would expect the service to inform me if an unfamiliar person was coming to do the work instead. If the dentist at the practice I visit were to leave to start their own practice, I would expect the office to notify me before I arrived for my next checkup.\n\nAnd if I expect a specific massage therapist to be working on my body, I'd like to make the decision about whether a new and unfamiliar person will be taking their place.\n\nIt's a shame that the owner of ESSpa believes that all MTs are made out of a cookie cutter and that customers don't deserve the choice of who touches them.
