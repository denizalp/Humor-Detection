I'm a fan of Culvers.  BIG fan.  Looove their ice cream, fried cheese curds,  & snack packs (just the right size for me).  So when I heard that there was a \"fancy\" Culver's in Middleton I got quite excited.  Luckily it lived up to my expectations.  \n\nI love it when restaurants use local products, and here, they do just that.  They use their next door neighbor's cheese in their products, none other than Carr Valley cheese.  Good stuff ;)  No literally, a Carr Valley retail store is RIGHT next door to the Blue Spoon.  \n\nI sampled that grilled cheese that Tracy G. had & I agree....it's pretty darn good.  Grilled to perfection!  \n\nI was impressed by their extensive wine list!  Many local wineries were listed, which was great.  They also had area beers, too.  \n\nTheir gelato....was eh.  Ok at best.  I had pistachio.  Nothing super memorable.  But overall, I really liked the Blue Spoon & would recommend a stop here if you're in the Madison area.  \n\nNote:  They don't serve butterburgers here.  It's a classy place ;)
