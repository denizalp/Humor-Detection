Try their Cauliflower pasta! It was my and my entire party of 10 girls' favorite dish. We ordered several off of their prefix menu. DEE-licious.\n\nTheir appetizers were fun. They brought us a giant plate full of compartments that contained different appetizers. There were a lot that were reminiscent of Indian food: black lentils, egg plant, green olives, etc. Since I'm a vegetarian, I can only discuss the Veggi dishes.\n\nThe Cauliflower pasta sounds like it would contain a weird taste, but their sauce and consistency of the pasta was made and blended to perfection. Their Margarita pizza was to die for. I had incidentally had margarita pizza the night before as a late night snack at Grand Lux Cafe, and I was blown away by how incomparable Otto's Margarita pizza is. It's rich, soft, fluffy, and delightfully tasty. The final Vegetarian dish that we had was the ricotta cheese pasta with marinara sauce. That was cooked to perfection as well.\n\nI especially liked that they provided each of us with skinny bread stick packets. I wasn't a fan of their wine, and unfortunately I don't remember which kind we ordered. \n\nThe prefix menu also included several desserts, and they were all delicious, especially the marshmallow one. \n\nService was impeccable, but the only issue was that they seated us off to a corner where we weren't under the cool Palazzo daylight sky ceiling.
