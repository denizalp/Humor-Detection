Rather than trying our luck with squishing five people into the restaurant, we decided to get takeout and I think we made a good choice.  Opening up the takeout containers while sitting around my sister's kitchen table, it felt like she had returned from picking up dinner at a friend's house.  A friend that is an AMAZING cook.\n\nWe had a sampling of everything, aka \"le gros\", an order of chili fries and a dozen chicken wings.  This was the perfect amount of food for the five people we were chowing down.  Everyone ate until very satisfied, and there were even some leftovers.  I was wowed by the fact that while all the different meats tasted like \"bbq\", it was all different flavours and didn't all taste the same.  I really like the chicken wings, they are super meaty, not the little wimpy wings I'm used to.  And the flavour!  Delicious!  Move over Colonel Sanders, because THIS is finger lickin' good!  The sides were good too, the baked beans in particular with their smoky molasses flavour.  I wasn't super amazed by the fried mac and cheese, but I can see the appeal, it just wasn't my thing (but then I'm not a huge mac and cheese fan either).  The chili fries were delicious: this isn't your typical Wendy's style chili, this is braised beef goodness!  Think the bbq version of an Italian poutine.
