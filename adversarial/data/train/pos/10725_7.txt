10\/06\/11\n\n3.5 stars.\n\nDelicious!  The menu is quite extensive, and if you cannot find what you're craving for, ask for it anyway, as the kitchen will try to accommodate you!  I asked if one is still able to bring in raw food from the market to be prepared here, and I was told yes- good to know!  Very friendly service, but I must admit I was there w\/ friends related to the owners.  \n\nClean atmosphere and very bright inside.  The tables are a bit too close to each other, I thought, but nothing that can't be adjusted if one asked the management, I'm sure.\n\nOn my next visit, I will have to remember to ask about omitting cornstarch as I did break out due to food allergies.  To those w\/ MSG (monosodium glutamate) allergy, no worries here as the kitchen does not use it.  \n\nBTW, I couldn't find what I had cravings for (crispy Mongolian beef over noodles) on the menu, but after speaking w\/ the matron of the house, Mrs. Leung, I was able to eat something close to it.  I did find the dish a little too salty, but it was still good.  I liked the crispiness of the noodles, as well; However, the leftover noodles didn't reheat well.  I suggest to eat your fill at the resto, or share w\/ friends (which I did, but I still had some leftover)...  \n\nHope to go back soon!
