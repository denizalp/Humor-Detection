The last time I was in this building was when it was known as Crossroads mall.  That's been a while but as much as inside was hyped to change, it really hasn't changed much.\n\nThe best thing about this mall is the food court which has several independently owned places. The other good thing about this mall is the ginormous kids play gym.  I guess they were trying to compete with Carowinds next door.  \n\nOther than that, parts of the mall have a street-like feel with building facades but many storefronts are empty and the ones that are open are junky.  \n\nI always thought this mall was a waste of space.  But with a decent food court, may not so much of a waste.
