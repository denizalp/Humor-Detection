**Go to The Bellagio instead. Don't waste your money here!**\nSo let me start off by saying that I rarely take the time to write reviews. But I read the reviews of others quite often and that is what led me to this buffet at the Wynn. \n\nI have to say that this place was THE BOMB when I came here 1 year ago. I couldn't wait to go back for the dessert crepe station, king crab legs and creme brûlée. \n\nI'm sorry and sad to report that none of these things were at the breakfast buffet. No crab legs.  Not even snow crab. No creme brûlée. No crepe station. Really???? \nEverything we ate was just ok. Some of it was totally disgusting! The prime rib was so good 1 year ago that it has stood out in my mind ever since. But, today it was just like the prime rib you can get anywhere else. Average. \nAnd they bumped up the brunch price to $38 just for Mother's Day. This price DID NOT include champagne. Wasn't that nice of them?  I will NEVER eat at this buffet again. I will go to the Bellagio next time or Studio B. I'm sorry but $40 for breakfast better include some crab legs, creme brûlée and champagne. Soooooo disappointed. (and so were the 3 friends that came with us, which was my idea!)
