A positive or negative review will follow depending on the outcome of a used car deal made between me and Cardinaleway Mazda just over a week ago.  So far, I regret having driven the car off the lot.  Updates to follow.\n\n9\/12 Updated to 3 stars because my financing came through as promised by Mike in finance and my trade in loan was paid off.  Due to the shuddering issues and air conditioning issues I am having with the used car I bought I am forced to take it to the Ford dealership.  This will cost me $170.  If this is covered under the Ford powertrain warranty then I will add a star or two.  The appt with Ford is on 9\/23.  Updates to follow.
