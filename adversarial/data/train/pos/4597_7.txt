My friend and I reserved for Encore Beach Club for a Saturday morning. We followed the directions to arrive within the suggested time window, specifically before 11:30am because that was when the guest list closes. While standing in line, we were informed by the employee checking guest list names that entry was now 25$ per person because they reached the 300 women-limit. No Cover Nightclubs did not warn us about this 300 women limit, and this was not expressed on the Encore Beach Club website. Instead of paying, we left to Rehab (we had this as a backup from Chris Hornak's list). \n\nWe eventually went back to Encore Beach Club using Andre Lucas for Sunday; we received free drink tickets and did not have to stand in line because it was guest\/staff list. \n\nI'm sure Encore Beach Club may have been a fluke in reserving with No Cover Nightclubs, but because of that experience, we may just stick with promoters from friends.
