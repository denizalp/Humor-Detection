I love the shops and restaurants in this plaza! A solid spectrum from drive-through quick (Chick-Fil-A) to proper sit down dining (Sushi 101, Turnhouse Grille) and a bunch of in between like Which Which and Jason's Deli and Qdoba. Desserts from Ben & Jerry's!\n\nProper retail shopping here, too. Total Wine is always a big hit.\n\nMy biggest problem here is the very limited access from the roads. Yes, it's located at one of the very busiest intersections in all of Charlotte (Park Road and Woodlawn Road) and the sloping topology doesn't help. Sharp turns and up a hill from Woodlawn, down a too narrow alleyway off Park Road or up a sloped entrance competing with the Chick-Fil-A off Woodlawn. No good choices.\n\nOnce you're parked (no, there is not nearly enough parking), a plethora of options for eating to choose from. https:\/\/www.yelp.com\/list\/parktowne-village-charlotte is a great start.
