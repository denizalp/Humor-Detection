Note.  This review is just for the bad coffee experience I had one morning.\n\nI had to stop here one morning for coffee as I was on my way to an off-site meeting.  Normally I wouldn't bother with a review of convenience stores, but who the HELL put decaf in the regular pot?  How could I tell it was decaf?  Susan didn't assume the form of a human female after drinking it!  It tasted burnt and flat and I'm pretty sure I peeled a little film of the top!\n\nOn the other hand, the meeting wasn't worth staying awake for anyway!
