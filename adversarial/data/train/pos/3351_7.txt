I came here about a month ago with my boyfriend who lives in vegas since he knows how much i love minerals since i was in town to visit him. While their selection is impressive for many reasons, I was overall left with an \"eh\" feeling about it. It might be great for someone else who likes minerals\/crystals\/fossils for a more scientific reason and has a much larger bank account then me, but I don't exactly get excited about wanting to come back the next time i'm in town. \n\npros:\n\n-there is a lot of inventory\n-some of their larger specimens are beautiful\n-fun outing to go to if someone you know loves fossils or minerals\n-a lot of selection if you're buying for high-end collection \n\n\ncons:\n\n-the energy in the store is off-putting at best, and considering it is a crystal shop, that's concerning\n-EXPENSIVE, maybe i've just been blessed to live around cheaper shops but even their \"cheap\" products were overpriced in my book\n\nthe people at the shop weren't bad but overall it wasn't really what i was looking for and didn't have a lot to offer past the whole \"largest mineral store\" thing they like to boast. I don't really feel like buying an inferior product for for more then i should and then lugging it back to SD with me but hey, you might be sool and this might be the only mineral store you can actually get to. And any physical store is better then online shopping.
