Came here for the first time after Father's Day to get my dad some doughnuts.\nThe service was GREAT! We offered to have any flavors that weren't displayed to be made fresh!\nI got the green tea pistachio ( quite good) \nAnd the blueberry Cinnamon Toast Crunch ( HOLY CRAP SO GOOD!!) my BF got the taro ( good) \nI got my dad the Oreo doughnut ( he said it was the best doughnut he's ever had! Which says a lot because he has had a lot of them haha) \n\nWe'll be back! I loved it!
