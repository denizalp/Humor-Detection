I came here to grab a drink and a little something to eat before watching Jupiter Ascending at the nearby Harkins.\n\nI sat at the very crowded bar...managing to find a seat between two people and was immediately greeted by an energetic bartender (Fern?).  I asked if they had flights.  Back in San Diego, I get flights all the time but it's usually no more than 4 or 5 tasters and around $12 or so.  Here you get SIX tasters and it's $10 flat.  Nice.\n\nThey have a very good selection...better than Yardhouse IMO.  I chose five stouts and a trippel and ordered the Happy Hour Crab and Seafood Cakes.  The crab cakes were just okay...I've had better.  I think the aioli needs work but for only $5.95 it's hard to complain.\n\nOverall I liked Thirsty Lion and would come back to try other things.  The manager and both blonde bartenders were very attentive and the vibe of the Tempe Marketplace is awesome on a cool night in February.  A must if you're in the area.
