People might think that a dayclub at Sapphire is sleazy and this is inaccurate. I had a great time here. There are some beautiful people here, there are some people that think they are beautiful.. and it's expensive. But knowing this it isn't bad at all. We got a day bed... not just the hair, but the middle or the road which is like a bed with partial shade. It costs like $175 but that is a flat-rate and you can drink and eat for the whole sum (they will add gratuity). So we stayed here all day, and we drank as much as we could.. and we ate until we got full.. and in the end of the day we were about $175. Not bad considering we had basically breakfast, lunch and a lot of drinks here.. and good service and quite the entertainment.\n\nThe provide free limo service to the dayclub. This is quite nice. BUT when you're drunk and on your way to your hotel, there are vultures that want to take advantage of you. They are not associated to the club as far as I can tell. I called them out on their bullshit.. and got a ride from some locals. Awesome people. \n\nAll in all... this place is pricey, and not as classy as they would want it to be. But it is what it is, and it is a good time - even if it will cost you, it wont cost you that much. Really. About 200 bucks for meals and drinks in Vegas. Not too shabby. I will be back.\n\nThe only serious negative I have is that it is loud. Way to loud. The music is club music, and they have some fairly cool DJs that keeps the mood up.. but the volume is insane.
