We stayed here for 5 days to visit with our granddaughters from Bay Area CA.  Upon arriving we soon realized that our room had no internet.  I was on the phone with the front desk along with the internet provider for over an hour to no avail.  The next morning they had us move to room C235 (which was a complete inconvenience since we had already unpacked everything!!!).  This room, while directly next to the pool, still had very spotty WIFI and I was constantly getting booted from the internet both on my iphone and my ipad.\n\nWhile the pool was nice and the grandchildren enjoyed the Oasis Water Park ($40 per wrist band for extra guests) there was no microwave in the hotel room and the mini fridge (if you can call it that) was so small that nothing fit, and the few things we did put in it (which were leftovers from the Rustlers Roost) along with our beverages were warm in the morning!!!  \n\nBottom line......this place might offer you a deal on the room rate, but be very prepared to spend a crapload of money at the \"Lobby Bar & Grill\", \"Rustlers Roost\" or \"Aunt Chiladas\"!!!  They make sure you can't store or prepare food in your room.  I've stayed at some pretty shady motels in my life and they have ALL had a mini fridge with a mini freezer and for the most part a microwave!!!  We were very disappointed in this hotel and will NEVER EVER AGAIN STAY HERE!!\n\nOh and don't forget the $40\/day resort fee on top of your room rate.....then ad $5\/day tax to that!! Really??\n\nOh and if you order a movie for the kids it's only good for ONE WATCH, not 24 hours like everywhere else.  Seriously this place is a RIPOFF!!  Do yourself and your family a financial favor and stay in Mesa, then get tickets to Sunsplash for $20\/day and put the rest of your money in your back pocket or grab a pizza at 1\/4 the cost of that money grabber AZ Grand Resort!  I know I will next time.\n\nTobin
