It's certainly better than watching soccer in a spring training baseball field, but there are still improvements that can be made. \n\n1. Put some numbers up on each row of the parking. Getting in was fine, but remembering which row my car was in after the game was a pain with no numbers or signs to guide us. \n\n2. If you are running two car lanes to get in, don't narrow them down to one lane going around curves. Merging is not something that most people do well, nor should it be necessary if the lanes were wider around the curves. Not sure why it was set up this way, but it should be easy to fix.\n\n3. Someone said that there is a large variety of food and drink but the tent behind our section only had hotdogs and churros. If there is a large selection it was not apparent.\n\n4. The stadium sound system was terrible. We couldn't understand anything that was being said by the announcer and at times couldn't even hear him over the music that was played.\n\n5. Finally, I can appreciate fan support and fan groups, but why would the team allow political statements to be on banners hung next to the field? Having a large banner that says \"Solidarity with Antifas\" and another that says \"Refugees Welcome\" in front of the Bandidos fan section is no way to gain public support in a city and state that are predominately conservative and Republican. Most sports teams have a policy that signs have to be about sports and maybe its time to implement and enforce something like that. Keep politics out of the game!\n\nOverall, I'm excited that the Phoenix Rising has a great new place to play and I hope they get promoted to MLS, but I hope they make some improvements.
