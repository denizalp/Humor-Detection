I've never been a fan of Cheesecake Factory because I feel like their food is mediocre and overpriced. That being said, this newly opened restaurant at the Las Vegas North Premium Outlets is a welcome addition. Dining options at the outlets have always been severely limited and kind of atrocious. It's nice to have a sit-down option instead of eating at the food court. \n\nPRO TIP: Make sure to enter through the front entrance near the street, otherwise you'll walk in on the side like we did and be confused as to where the hostess stand is located. \n\nCOMPLIMENTARY BREAD: Served with softened butter that spread easily on the bread. Love when that happens. 4\/5\n\nFRIED ZUCCHINI ($4.95): Served with a side of ranch. Came with maybe 8 pieces of zucchini. Delicious. 4\/5\n\nLOUISIANA CHICKEN PASTA ($16.95): Our waiter said this dish was very popular. My husband and I split this dish and ordered the chicken on the side. More than enough food for two people! I don't understand how they serve this huge bowl of pasta to one individual. Unfortunately, the dish wasn't as spicy as I would have liked and could have used a bigger helping of veggies. 2\/5 \n\nSERVICE: Waiter was great. He was super cool about accommodating a picky vegetarian eater (me). Hostess was super friendly and we were sat at a booth on a Monday night with no wait time. 4\/5  \n\nVIBE: Modern cafe with a tan and brown color palette. Very family friendly. 3\/5 \n\nGOOD TO KNOW: If you fill out the feedback survey on your receipt, you get a $10 e-gift card good on your next visit. :)\n\nWorth a Return Visit?\nSubtotal was about $27 for one entree and one small appetizer. Prices add up quickly here. We ate here because we were starving and didn't have a lot of dining options available to us. I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here, only as a last resort kind of thing.\n\nYELP 100 CHALLENGE 2015: #227
