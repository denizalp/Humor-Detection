My stay was around April 22-25 I believe and overall eventhough the place does have not the greatest reviews I can say it's fair to rate them the 4 stars I have them due to my own experience. Our suite was okay only thing that kind of bothered me was the closeness of the beds but since we hardly were in the room that didn't really make my trip any different . They had decent free breakfast in the morning for all their guest. They always assisted us with anything we needed when we would ring them up on the front desk. But When I started to flip out was when I lost my iPhone 6 in the hotel room which I thought I had left in the cab when we got dropped off that night from the strip. I live in The Bay Area so my chances of going back and finding it were impossible and we were leaving the next morning. \n\nOf course I go on find my iPhone once I'm back home after a long phone less road trip and start tracking it but it says it's actually at the hotel. I'm not sure what happened but I had left my phone somehow in the hotel room and not the cab. Lol. I call the front desk of course let them know I lost my phone with a full description and told them if they found it to call me back to let me know and move on from there. Did I honestly think they were going to call me back ? Heck no ! I'm glad they were a honest staff and called me back letting me know my phone was found and that if I would like it back just to send a shipping label and they would box it up and send it out to me. My sense of relief ! Even though I had already gotten another phone since I was phone less for a few days. I was glad I was able to get the old one with all the pictures I had token from the trip and such. \n\nThank you Rita Suites for sending my phone back !
