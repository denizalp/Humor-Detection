Not great food but not bad either. It's typical Americanized Chinese cuisine. They do deliver and for me that's a huge benefit. They offer all of the typical entrees and their portions are generous. \n\nI just upgraded my review to five stars because TS' bitchy review. I have been ordering food from this establishment for three years and have never had any issues. I think TS is a scumbag.
