You've heard of dive bars? This is is a dive cafe. Just about everything at the Holy Oak has a rustic and mismatched air about it -- and the faintest hint of grime. When I walked up to the bar tucked at the back of this diminutive shop, I almost wanted to order a round of PBRs, but it was Sunday morning and I thought better of it.\n\nIt's located steps from Lansdowne subway station which makes it a highly convenient meeting point for Bloordale Villagers. They make a solid espresso here (Intelligensia) and also offer tea, hot chocolate, and baked goods. It was a rock solid place to spend a few hours with my laptop plunking out reviews. The vibe is quiet enough to chill out without feeling that you are in a library or mausoleum. There is free wifi, but outlets are far and few between.\n\nIf the HOC has a failing it's the filthy washrooms (which included a note on the urinal imploring me to turn a knob as I \"wizzed\" (sic) to prevent stink) but my feelings were quickly ameliorated when I spotted a mirror outside the loo emblazoned with the Def Leppard logo. So I guess I don't mind so much. This entire paragraph was useless. I apologise.\n\nOn my last visit the staff was painstakingly applying gold leaf to the acoustic tiles on the ceiling; I wonder if they're done yet?\n\nObligatory Title Pun: Holy Oak Cafe Batman!\n\nMenu Readability: I can't remember, but if I had to guess... chalkboard?\n\nNeed to mention: They really do sell beer and other boozies.\n\nWhat this place teaches me about myself: I might need to rethink my Sunday morning teetotaling ways.
