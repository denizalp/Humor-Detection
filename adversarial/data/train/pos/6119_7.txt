I came here a few years ago to buy a clutch and i specifically asked the guy if everything i needed came included and he said yes then when i had my car at the shop they told me the pilot bearing was missing so i tried to call back to let them know and they put the blame on the company who makes the clutch while i do agree that some of the blame is on that company the guy at AMP did not make sure he was right so when i threatened to report them to the BBB he kindly responded by saying do you know who the KKK is?
