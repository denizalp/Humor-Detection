It's been a few years since my last review. Since then I've been back a couple of times and have noticed some inconsistency in their food and service. Nonetheless, they are still standing, which is more than can be said for a few other places. The latest visits really reinforced that their best dishes are the most popular ones because they don't get a chance to sit around. The more I experience dim sum outside of Montreal, the more I realize that as a city, the quality is lacking. However, there are some dishes which consistently deliver as \"the best\": har gow, cheung fan (any variation), and their char siu bao. You may be forgotten by a server, but this place is bustling, so it's understandable.   \nAll this being said, I haven't found a better spot yet. There's more investigating to do!
