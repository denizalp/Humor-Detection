True to the name the Rock-n-Lobster has pictures of Led Zeppelin, fisherman's nets adorning the walls, and plenty of seafood items on the menu.  My first visit I tried the fried fish sandwich which was a bit heavy but nice and crispy and the fries are fresh and tasty.  Next time I'm looking forward to trying the lobster bites and a side of sweet potato fries and if I make it a third time before they go belly up, the jumbo lump crab cakes.\n\nOn a Sunday afternoon there was no music at all and football was on all screens.  There was a girl with wicked tattoos sitting across from me with her friend and you know she was there because it says \"ROCK n LOBSTER\" outside.  We were both sorely missing some good music!  \n\nWith only ten or fifteen people in the place all screaming at the games on the t.v.'s it was definitely all sports bar and no rock-n-roll.  But we'll see how they hold up.  Hopefully they won't continue to claim to be one thing and end up being another.  Confusing patrons is always a recipe for disaster.\n-----------------------------------\nBeen back a few times.  Friday and Saturday nights are the most \"rock-n\" time to go.  Music is good but not too loud.  People who would make this place fun are slowly picking up on it.  The parking lot is the biggest limitation because it gets packed before the restaurant does.  \n\nOf note, there are two or three regular older guys who show up, get drunk and slam their hands on the bar a lot which obviously annoys the other patrons but the owner either hasn't figured out it's bad for business or just doesn't know what to do about it.  \n\nStill haven't tried the lobster bites but the lobster pops (skewers) are a great appetizer for sharing if you can stand the apprehensive atmosphere.  And avoid the spicy sauce the waiter tries to hustle.  It's gnarly.
