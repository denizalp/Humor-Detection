As promised, I have given Aiello's another try. I have ordered from here twice since my last review. I got a grilled chicken salad once and a pepperoni roll the second time. Both were delicious! I am happy to have a nice pizza joint in the area, although it is still not my go-to place. Cons: cash only and service could still use some tweaking.
