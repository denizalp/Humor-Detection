This is my first time here and I am HUGE on bibimbap ever since my sister made it. We've also tried it at a little mom & pop shop by the other Trader Joe's on the other side of town.. which that place has since closed  so when my boyfriend this place I just knew I had to try it.. \n\nNice & clean, friendly staff. \n\nYou get to choose from white or purple rice. I chose white this time. You get to pick 6 toppings & you can either add fried eggs for $1 extra. I went with the original sauce because that's how I like mine. But they have different sauces. \n \nIn my opinion it tasted a bit bland (easy fix) add salt. But that's just me. As far as drinks we weren't able to get any from the menu because the guy said it was seasonal and also because they had just opened. Not much choices on the drinks with the fridge they had there so we just got Coke. But we will definitely come back.
