Yes. You read that right. I hit two different Chick-fil-a locations in the same day. ....and I'm not even a little ashamed to admit it! I love their product! \n\nWe stopped by this location around noon time. It was pretty busy, but we still got quick speedy, and friendly service from the young lady who took our orders. Everything arrived quickly and all orders were accurate....and it goes without saying that the food, as always, was luscious! Yes, I said it....lusious!\n\nMmmm, MMmmmm.MMMM! Love me some Chick-fil-a! Eat Mor Chikin!! lol Whatever, just make me my sammich!!\n\nThe older  lady who refilled our drinks was very kind and pleasant as well. \n\nOnly difference between this and the other location we visited was their bathrooms were nice and clean!\n\n\n5 stars it is!
