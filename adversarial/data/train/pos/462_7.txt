Yesterday was a blur and needed my Raku fix on! Grateful for an awesome company, we were greeted with friendship and hospitality, thanks to Satay's own Saturday nights Patio Sessions resident DJ Nathan Sense Uhlir, who splurged us with a pitcher of Sapporo beer and a side of laughs throughout dinner.\n\nIt has been a while since my last visit to Raku and I was pleased that Raku expanded their restaurant with a new room. The table that we sat in was really cool. It had an open rectangular shape in the middle of our booth\/table that had a mini traditional\/organic barbecue pit.\n\nMr. Uhlir ordered most of the items on the special black board menu and everything was fantastic! I only wish that I had written down the names, but since I didn't my list of items in US version as follows:\n\nHomemade cold and hot tofu.\nRaw cold meat with amazing edible accessories on top & a drop of sauce\nSpecial Toro Dish (seared fatty tuna)\nSpecial grilled Salmon collar bone\n\nfrom the Robatta Grill:\nEnoki Mushroom wrapped with Bacon\nGreen Hot Chili Pepper \nKurobuta Pork Cheek\n\nAnd last but not least: Soba buckwheat noodle salad with amazing secret dressing! Each time we order this salad, we drink the excess dressing like soup! \n\nI LOVE RAKU! Service and food never fails and last night, I had tears of joy in my Raku!
