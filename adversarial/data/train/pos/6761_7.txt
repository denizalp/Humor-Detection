The three stars is mainly for the prime rib.\n\nAlright when in Vegas, you've got to hit a buffet, it's just a must. I'm not sure how we decided on mirage, but I've never been here so why not. The prime rib was definitely something to rave about, super tender and juice not like most buffets, but the second round it was dry..Whyyyy. Consistency people! Consistency is key. \n\nOverall, it was extremely mediocre. Like the brink of EHHHHH and mediocre. Like it barely reached the standard of OK. Well, that's a $35 dollar buffet for you when there are $40-50 ones and even $80-90 ones during holiday season like bacchanal. There wasn't a lot of options or variety. Desserts are usually something I'm attracted to at buffets, but definitely not here. don't call your froyo soft serve ice cream gelato...because it's not. Such false advertisement. It's unlimited beer and wine which is nice, but it sucks that allllll drinks are self serve and we were seated on the opposite side...it was so far :( yeah we're lazy but when in Vegas, you just expect quality places with quality service! That's not too ridiculous right?
