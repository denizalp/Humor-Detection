Yum! Campagnolo is a great place to break bread and share tapas-style Italian eats with friends and family. The service is friendly and attentive, and the food is delicious. I especially liked the braised boar on polenta (perfect stick-to-your-ribs food for a snowy evening!), the fresh burrata cheese with roasted grapes (!), and the fresh pappardelle with peas and lemon. The cocktail menu is also a stand-out. \n\nThe decor is cozy and unpretentious. The candlelight makes for a romantic atmosphere. You could bring a date here, but it's so much fun to dine with a bunch of friends and order a boatload of dishes to share and sample. Go, eat! Mangia!
