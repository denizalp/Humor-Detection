I'm not sure what happens here. The shift manager was complaining to the only other customer at the counter how this is broken & that is broken & how it's so frustrating. Try being on my side of the counter waiting & waiting while three ladies deal with the drive-thru (which was packed), 3 other employees are floating about the dining room & the said shift manager is filling up a coffee cup which never fills because it has a hole in it.\nNow the whole thing about multiple things being broken transported me right back to the fiasco at McDonalds in Banning CA last month where a lot of stuff was broken. One other thing I found strange. There were 18 cars in the parking lot. So seeing how this is McDonalds & it would seem unlikely for each car to be carrying just 1 person (especially the soccer mom vans), I was expecting to see this place packed inside. Nope. There were only 9 people in the place. Maybe this is a Park n Ride lot! \nFood was standard Micky D's. Breakfast burrito's were hot & tasty. Considering they're a buck, quite the deal. The drink station was a mess as were a few tables in the dining area. Not sure what the 3 employees meandering about the dining room were up to. One was pushing the mop bucket around and another had a rag in her hand. However, the table next to me was dirty & she walked right past it & didn't seem to care. Not sure about the 3rd one. Maybe just got back from break! That dirty table, never got cleaned the whole time we were there.
