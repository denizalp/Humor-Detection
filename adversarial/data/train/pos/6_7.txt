I want my Lunch Specials!! \n\nI placed my order for the Halibut Wrap\/fries with pop ($7.95) at 12 pm or so on a Wednesday and the nice waitress inform me they were sold out! At 12 pm???\n\nSince I really want to have some deep fried oily fish for lunch so I stuck with ordering\n\nHalibut with chips ($10.95) \n- The fish though small but was nicely done.. lightly breaded and deep fried to light golden brown. The fish itself was moist and fresh\n- I will skip the fries next time... nothing really specials.. \n\n50 cents extra for tartar sauce? that little tiny thing cost 50 cents? I think with the prices they charging they should just give the extra sauce for free!\n\nWaitress was nice and efficient but can be a little pushy? She reminds me of someone's mother.. and I was told to be a good girl and  finish all my food... :)
