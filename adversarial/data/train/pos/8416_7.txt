After trying Jacob , I've developed an obsession for good steak,  and factoring in so many people raving about this steakhouse ''best in Toronto... one of the best toronto has to offer..blah blah'',  we decided to give into our curiosity and give it a try.  \n\nAtmosphere of the place was quite cozy,  it was small,  candle lit with decors as older than I am and portrait paintings like the ones found in Scooby-doo where their eyes follow you around .  I felt like I'm in a haunted house dated back in the pioneer days.\n\nMaybe because I'm quite young,  and the server might've prejudged that we weren't good tippers,  the service we received was way below expectation.  We often had to waved him or other servers down to order, ask for things,  and didn't do his 2-bite check while we were waiting for him since he got the wrong dessert order....  While the table next to us had amazing service and server even insisted he buys them dessert because they were doctors -.-'\n\nWhen yelpers say they have an EXTENSIVE menu,  they weren't kidding.  12-point, single spaced,  double page,  200 pages long.  After I saw it I didn't even want to bother. \n\nJumbo shrimp = 4\/5  the shrimp were as big as my whole fist.  Served with cocktail sauce,  with a kick,  but doesn't stay spicy in your mouth for too long.  For 27$ an order of 3, not worth the money. \n\nFrench onion soup= 5\/5..  The amount of cheese in the soup is enough to fill you in as a meal.  It was more like French onion sauce with cheese.  I'm not complaining.  \n\nEscargot= 2\/5  they were really small,  baked I'm garlic butter with mushroom, they were quite mediocre,  surprisingly I've had better in an Asian Cafe,  at least they bake it with cheese.  \n\nCeaser salad: 2\/5 Meh.  No bacon?! I'd give it a 1\/5 but only giving it an extra point just cus they use fresh Parmesan \n\nK.. Appetizers weren't the greatest,  but let's see what these yelpers rave about their steaks. \n\n16oz rib eye steak : 2\/5 rare,  split between 2 people.  The meat was supposedly to be one portion but the two of us couldn't even finish it. It was quite charred on the outside,  not crispy enough tho. After a well satisfied steak at Jacob,  my palette for steak has gotten pretty expensive.  I've learned the quality of the meat makes it or breaks it...  And there is the same ones you find at the keg.  \n\nIt came with a side of baked potato, which was nice since steak houses usually doesn't come with anything (expect when you go to chain restaurants) was expecting a loaded stuffed twice baked but it came out just regular,  plain..  And the server will bring you sour cream,  bacon that tastes like Jerky,  Parmasean cheese o\/s\n\n''the house'' Chocolate mousse = 3\/5  the presentation is good,  chocolate mousse was inside a chocolate house,  but the portion was way to small to charge 10$\n\n\nThis place is over rated.  For the prices they charge,  I was expecting a little more than the keg,  I'd give it 4\/5 but since they are more expensive,  my expectations should go up as well.  For those that claims this is the best steak house in Toronto,  spend a little more for Jacobs,  it's worth every penny.  \n\nOut of the 3 steak house I've been to,  Ruth Chris,  Jacob,  and barbarian....  Barbarian would be placed last. \n\nThank you johann r. for funding my expensive palette  :D
