Cornish Pasty Co. is a little hard to spot when you get to the plaza.  I was thinking it was near Lotus of Siam so when I walked by LoS and didn't see it.   I was a little confused to where it was.  That was until I looked around and noticed it was across the huge parking lot from me.  Ugh!!   Everything was good when I got inside though.\n\nAnyways, on to the Pasties.  When I saw pics of them on yelp, I had a general idea how big they were.  Unfortunately, I made the mistake of ordering two pasties and getting super stuffed.  I didn't anticipate how dense one of the pasties would be.  I went ahead and ordered the Royale with Cheese since it seemed pretty popular and to balance it out with a veggie option, I went with the Balsamic Portabello.\n\nRoyale with Cheese --  http:\/\/bit.ly\/1ngvJrW\nHamburger, (medium or well) French fries, grilled onions, mushrooms, bacon, cheddar Swiss blend, Side of ranch, 1000 island, ketchup, or BBQ sauce.\nThe Royale with Cheese was good, but I'm not sure if it's something I'd order again.  It was way too dry for me.  The fries and puff pastry combined made this pasty a little hard to swallow even after spreading the special sauce around it.  The beef hamburger inside was pretty good though.\n\nBalsamic Portabello --  http:\/\/bit.ly\/1ngvu07\nBalsamic marinated portobello mushrooms, fresh mozzarella, roasted red peppers and fresh basil. With a side of marinara.\nI'd say that my favorite between the two Pasties I ordered was definitely the Balsamic Portabello.  It was pretty much like eating a calzone.  You just gotta love gooey mozzarella and mushrooms.  The pastry on this one wasn't as dense as the Pastry on the Royale with Cheese.\n\nOverall, I was pretty impressed with their Pasties and liked how many different types of Pasties they made over there.  If I lived in Vegas, I'd probably visit them quite often to try all of them.
