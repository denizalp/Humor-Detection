I got to ride on a Segway for 2 hours. I learned a LOT about our fair city. And I've lived here for 5 years! We took the in-laws while they were in town and we all had a fantastic experience.\n\nIt takes a few minutes to get used to riding the Segway, but once you have it figured out, it's incredibly intuitive. Also, fun fact, it's a personal transport vehicle, in the same category as a wheelchair (or hoveround). So it's allowed inside buildings and anywhere that is wheelchair accessible.\n\nYou'll get some funny looks from passersby who are intrigued by a group of people wobbling about on Segways, but it's a great way to see a lot of town with minimal effort.\n\nThe tour guides are entertaining, knowledgable and excellent Segway instructors. They really make the experience worthwhile.\n\nSo next time you're looking for something fun to do around town and have some cash to spare, consider taking a Segway tour with Charlotte NC Tours. It is REALLY fun, and educational. \n\nJust like PBS.
