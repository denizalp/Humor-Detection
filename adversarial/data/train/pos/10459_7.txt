I can't even tell you how happy I was to see that Los Taquitos was finally opened in terminal 4 at Sky Harbor, so happy! I am a fan of their south Phoenix location. \n\nSo I checked out the menu board, didn't see anything that would catch my eye, but I was committed to giving them a try. I ordered a carne asada burrito and asked for extra salsa, even paid for it, order came out to 11 bucks, didn't even get a drink.\n\nMy order came out, let's start with the burrito, the tortilla was cold the meat had good flavor, but it was just carne & beans, that's it , no pico de gallo no guac, it was wrapped in a aluminum colored wrapping and came in a container with beans and rice, but the wrapped burrito was placed directly into the beans, so now that's a mess. \n \nThe beans were cool and so was the rice, it was like everything was made in a freezer house, oh and the extra salsa I had paid for, I had to ask for and the server gave a little tude because I question its whereabouts.\n\nI was thrilled to see Los Taquitos was coming into the airport, but now that I have been, I can't say I will be back.
