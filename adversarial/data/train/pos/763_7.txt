Truthfully, I didn't think I was going to enjoy my visit to tourneau. I guess I wasn't expecting too much. Also, I didn't think I was going to make a purchase when I walked in. LOL All I knew was that I wanted this brand of watch but didn't know what it entailed, price, etc. \n\nWalking in was alright, two young girls--first look would be like \"their just looking, no biggie\". We got a few smiles from their associates acknowledging us, but no one to really answer questions and what not. Until, I decided ask and try one. The person that helped us was JOSE. Jose was wonderful! He helped us with answering questions, explaining everything throughly with how special the watches were, and trying to help me figure out what was good for me. My friend and I were very impressed. After learning more, I was more intrigued into getting one! Then whoa, the prices came lol. Jose reminded me that a purchase this big should be a memorable one. Not something rushed. (I really respected that as a customer!) He also added that financing was available to make this purchase more possible!  Than BAM, the watch was sold. Jose made the experience of buying this watch more than just buying it. \n\nThank you so much jose!
