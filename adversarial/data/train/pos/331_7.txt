This sounds like a service that's too good to be true;  free limo pick-up, free entry, and free drinks (specific clubs), but it's all true! \n\nWe experienced this first hand during our recent trip to Vegas. \n\nJust go on the website and sign up ahead of time and around 5 pm that day you'll get a text from Danielle listing the available options and confirmation. \n\nEverything worked seamlessly! Colin, the limo driver will text you 20 min prior and always arrived on time! \n\nWe had to change the pick-up location a few times and Nick the proprietor along with the rest of the team were very patient with us. \n\nI will definitely be using VIP For Free again and recommending it to all our friends and family!\n\nThank you to everyone for making awesome memories
