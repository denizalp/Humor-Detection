One of my friends who still lives in Las Vegas, owed me dinner so when I made my way to the high desert for the holidays, he made reservations at CUT so he could pay off his debt. \n\nHaving lived in Las Vegas, I normally stay away from the Las Vegas Strip unless I'm showing someone around, but when it comes to dinner with a friend, and it's steak - you know I'm there! \n\nI'll start with the service. Everyone should dine here to experience what customer service in the food service industry should be like. I don't know what more to say other than the only way it could be better is if I could just lie on a couch while they hand fed me. \n\nI've said it before and I'll say it again - food almost always tastes so much better when the service is good. I opted for the Rib Eye and it was so tasty that I inhaled it like it was the first time I ever had beef. It's always nice when you order a piece of meat cooked a certain way and it comes out exactly as you want. To me, the sides were okay and I later was told I should have tried the marrow. \n\nI'll brave the Strip traffic and all the crowds to come here again. To me, the service alone was worth it.
