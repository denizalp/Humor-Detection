Picture 12 Washington Capital fans descending on Thursday's after an early afternoon hockey game.  \n\nIgnorant of the French Canadian Culture?  Check.\nReady to drink and be American? Check.\nAlready too drunk for 4 in the afternoon? Check.\n\nWhile I certainly don't like getting grouped into the \"M'erica\" type crowd, I was, with this group of twelve fine gentleman.  Thursday's handled us with care, fed us more shots that we could handle, and left us happily looking for another bar to act like idiots in.  The staff, from the bartender on down, was great.  The food was fuel, but it succeeded.  The drinking was awesome.\n\nI definitely would recommend this as a day-drinking, post-game drinking, or in general drinking spot.  I can't really remember what I ate, if it was good, or anything else about the meal...just a faint remembrance of being happy.
