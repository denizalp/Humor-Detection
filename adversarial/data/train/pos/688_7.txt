There is nothing not to like about this show.  I am by no means a Beatles die hard and I loved everything about the show.  The music and acoustics were amazing.  The aerials and stage were mystifying.  I read that they spent over $100 million building the stage and it shows.  It's truly amazing!  I know it's slightly different that other Cirque shows, but you will not be disappointed!\n\nJust a note, but we got our tickets on Travelzoo for half off.  $65 a ticket was a lot easier to stomach than the full price.
