Ive said it before and Ill say it again...White Pizza! Rocco's is one of the two pizza joints ill hit up when the pie craving hits. They make a great pie, and the price is right. You can of course order pizza whole or by the slice which is nice if I don't want to down a 12+ inch pie by myself, and the slice is generous. Rice balls and fried eggplant are also available among other things. I come here for the pizza so that's what im sticking to, and they do it well.
