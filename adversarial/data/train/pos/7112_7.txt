One thing I love about a Thai restaurant is the kitsch.  The decor here was really bland and I felt like I was eating in a hotel restaurant, rather than something as ethnically spicy as a Thai place.\nI had just finished at the rock gym just down the road and I was famished.  I hadn't been to this location yet and liked the one on Camelback, so I figured I'd give it a try.\nThe specials board should have just been erased.  I ordered the crab puffs, which were on the board, but was told about 5 minutes after I was seated that they were out.  What the heck?  Why keep it up there then?\nIt was 1pm on a Saturday and the place was almost completely empty.  Not a good sign.  \nOur drinks were refilled often, but it took about 15 minutes to get our food.  15 minutes in an empty place on a Saturday afternoon?  It just felt like a long wait.  Luckily, the satay appetizer came out quickly.  The peanut sauce wasn't as good as most and didn't have as much peanut flavor as it did sweet.\nOn the plus side, I ordered my catfish dish Thai hot...and it was.  It's not 11pm and I'm definitely feeling the burn!  Strong flavors, so I really don't mind.  My dad used to say \"If you can't feel it the next day, why eat it?\"  I guess I'm daddy's girl
