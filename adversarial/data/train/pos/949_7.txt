Here is how my experience went:\n\n1) Scheduled an appointment\n2) Showed up on time for my appointment\n3) Told I would probably have to wait at least an hour\n4) Awkwardly stood around with others who are waiting because there's no seating\n5) After 10 minutes said \"screw this\" to myself\n6) Walked out and went to Chipotle.\n\nDidn't get an exam, glasses, or contacts, but at least I got a burrito?
