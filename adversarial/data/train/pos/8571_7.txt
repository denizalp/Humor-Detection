I went to Longo's in search of chocolate to take back to Cali.  Not only did I find chocolate, I found a solid grocery store with a vast selection of food items!  If you want a comparison, it's like a Whole Foods store.  Although, I think Whole Foods might be a tad better.\n\nI came from the York St as I stayed at the Delta Toronto a block or two away.  As I go down the escalator, I suddenly feel like a little kid going down the escalator to the toy area in a department store.  I see rows upon rows of delicious, and different, food items.  Aside from the standard fare you will find at your local grocery store, they have specialty items, a deli, a place for ready made food, and of course, a bakery.  Right or wrong, I can sometimes judge a supermarket just by looking at the quality of their baked goods.  Well, not only was the selection huge, but the freshness seemed evident (caveat:  I didn't buy anything from the bakery).\n\nLuckily for me, I was able to control myself and didn't buy anything aside from the Coffee Crisp and Mr. Big candy bars to take back.  However, it's good to know that if I ever come back to watch a Raptors or Blue Jays game, I have a place to buy some grub to take back to the hotel.  That's if I can refrain from buying hot dogs from one of the 212 hot dog vendors in the 3 block area!!
