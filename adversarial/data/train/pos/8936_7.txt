So many choices for coffee nowadays. What to do? Go to Quik Trip or Circle K and get something fast and at a good price? Go to Starbucks and select from what seems like an ever expanding menu that keeps vying for those dollars in your pocket? Or do you go to the local coffee shop, where they know your name there, and better appreciate your dollars spent there, versus the red and yellow or green and white Goliath?\n\nThe correct answer is to come here. The coffee beans come from the owner's family farm in Brazil, and you'll come to appreciate it when you have a cup. Everything about the place is quality. There is no drive thru, but that is entirely the point. A place isn't designed this well, with couches and seats and a bar and tables, without the express intent of its patrons enjoying the comfort there, along with their food or drinks. I strongly recommend this place for any of you coffee lovers out there. Their service is on point as well, and on each occasion I've been during the past few weeks, I consistently get the same high quality I've now come to expect. This place just opened a few months ago, and its already attracting a huge following. Its going to be BIG. Just remember where you heard it first. :)
