Amazing customer service!!! I had ordered a refurbished laptop online only to find out that the battery was defective. So I came across Computer Repair and contacted them to see if they were able to help me. Having bad experiences with repair centers before I was kind if expecting for it to be a hassle. \nThey not only helped me with a diagnostic test to confirm that the battery had been defective but also offered to order it. \nThey were quick and were great at answering all my questions. I will definitely go back anytime I need something repaired.
