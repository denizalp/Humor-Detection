Participated in a really fun bachelorette party here!  We learned a burlesque chair routine.  The instructor was so friendly and was cheering us on the whole time.  I'm very uncoordinated, but I was able to follow along with the steps and didn't feel overwhelmed.  At the end we got time to take fun\/funny pictures and the bride got to take a saucy picture to send her fiance.  Would definitely recommend this for ladies' night out or future saucy parties!
