I have to say being a big fan of a great filet Mignon, Tom Colicchio's Heritage Steak you won my vote big time. Thanks to my casino host who recommend Tom Colicchio's Heritage Steak for dinner. When arriving to the hostess table you are greeted with a big smile and hello. After being seated, you are handed a menu. No more then a minute later the server comes over and ask what would you like to drink. So we ordered are drinks. Then we looked the amazing selections of steaks.\n\nFor appetizers we ordered the Cesar Salad and the Beet Salad that where just amazing. The house corn bread was excellent. Couple minutes after you get sample of some beef jerky that was so good. For the side dishes we ordered mushrooms, spicy fried onion rings and Brussels Sprouts. I have to tell you I was one happy person.\n\nFor the main dish I ordered the 10 ounce Filet Mignon. The best filet I had in Vegas. I have been to almost every steak house in Las Vegas. The filet was so tender and done perfect. Whatever Tom Colicchio's Heritage Steak Houses is doing, keep it up. I'll be back again the next time I'm in town. What I loved about the steak the most, no additional flavoring or  seasoning had to be added to the steak.\n\nThe service from the minute you arrive to the minute you leave was first class. You could not ask for a nicer staff that cared about every single customer. I loved the fact the server paid attention to every detail. If you are a person who really appreciates a great steak. I would not think twice of coming to Tom Colicchio's Heritage Steak. \n\nTom Colicchio's Heritage Steak is located steps away from the main entrance of the casino on you right hand side.
