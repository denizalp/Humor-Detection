Extremely disappointed with the overall service that this place gives to people that spend over $1,000 on bottle service. Let me first start off  by saying that don't deal with Lance, one of the most rudest and unprofessional managers I have come across in my life. You ever hear about customers always right LANCE? Especially a customer who has just spent $1,245 at the oh so infamous HAZE nightclub. I had bottle service for my 26th birthday and everything was going fine at the beginning oh let's say from 1030-1 when the club is not yet at capacity. Oh but the trouble started just after that. People started  walking in and out of OUR table as if they had paid for our table..HELLO security?!?! I tried getting a hold of them with no avail. What kind of crap is that. I told our host ROSE which I tipped $150 to get them out but said there was nothing she can do. uninvited people were coming in and out of our table that I asked rose to hold my bottle so no one would drink it since there was no security guarding the place, she said yes. Cool, I went to dance and when I came back my bottle was out on the table without my authorization emptied!! None of my people drank the bottle. What happened ROSE? You lied straight to my face saying you would hold my bottle. When I spoke to lance... or let me rephrase it when I tried to speak to LANCE he shut me down not letting me say one word. What he do? He kicked me out of the club instead. Wow just wow. You take my money and then kick me out LANCE. NICE. I would call you so many names Lance but it's not worth the time with this review. Bottom line is.. horrible management here when it comes to bottle service people are fake and not trustworthy.
