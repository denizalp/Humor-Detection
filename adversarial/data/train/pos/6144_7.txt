One star is still too high of a rating for the business practices of this dentistry office.  Although the care received might be professional; however their business practices are highly questionable.  The dentist recommended a treatment and the business office provided me a breakout of what my insurances would cover and what would be my responsibility for the care.  Nine months after receiving the treatment I receive a notice from this company that I owe additional money and I'm over 60 days past due.  I immediately contact the office, speaking with the office manager and insurance company together to learn the dentist office allowed their registration with my insurance lapse at the beginning if the year.  Now because of the dentist office's mistake they are charging me and telling me I'm late paying for their mistake.  Also, to mention, if they were up to date with their insurance registration I would have never had to pay another dime for my procedure and none of this would be happening.  \nI've asked now three times for the owner\/dentist to call me to discuss this issue but he chooses to ignore.  Then have his office manager send a 90 day past due notice and threaten to report to a collection agency.  \nThis business only wants your money and will sell you on every treatment possible to get it while deceiving the client on insurance coverages.
