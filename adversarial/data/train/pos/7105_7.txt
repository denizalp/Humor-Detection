This is an amazing tribute to an amazing artist! I want to download the MJ music now! An expensive show but definitely worth the money to get prime seats.  Sit in the first row of the second level as its interactive and this way you don't miss a thing! I am not a cirque fan, they didn't even tell me it was cirque based before I came but I didn't fall asleep in this cirque (like i have 3 of the 4 others I have seen) and I was quite entertained. They put on a show like MJ himself would have! \nThriller and Man in the Mirror were my favorites performed but all of it was fantastic! Audience was entralled and the effects were wonderful! Lots of dancing and special effects compared to acrobatics which was nice!  \nMy only question is: when did they start serving popcorn and M&M's during show productions?!?!?!?! \nYou can tell the performers enjoyed themselves and the costume design and backstage people did a great job. Great team effort by all! Definitely 5 stars!
