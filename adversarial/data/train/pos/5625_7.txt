If I could give a place zero stars, I WOULD!! After going up to Mount Washington on the Incline we were interested in relaxing with a cocktail and some appetizers on a patio with a view. It was 4:15 on a Wednesday and there were four adults and my daughter with us.\n\nAfter discussing where we wanted to sit the host asked the age of my daughter and since she is 4 we were not permitted to eat there! They have a policy that only children six and older are permitted to eat there!!! Who has ever heard of such a rule and I can guarantee my four year old behaves as well at a restaurant as a six year old or more.\n\nThey lost out on a big sale, big tip and a future customer. I can guarantee I will NEVER be back. After seeing how few stars they have I think we were spared!!!
