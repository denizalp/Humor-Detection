I went here twice, the first time a guy named Bob helped us, he was really kind and gave us a ton of free samples. We ordered a chocolate cake and it was delicious. We also got 3 free cookies for posting on facebook. 2nd time ( which was right now) the girl gave me 4 free cookies for free! So kind I guess holiday season :,)
