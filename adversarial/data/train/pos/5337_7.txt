Never Again.\n\nI admit, I came in with nothing. My truck had recently died so a junkyard came to get it. I went to Chapman Dodge because it was the closest dealership to my house. \n\nI will first say that the salesman I had (Scott) was awesome.  Not smarmy, not shady.  Really tried to work with me and get me a car that I could afford.\n\nLike I stated, I came in with zero down and I make little money. I waited for 7 hours and finally got a 2010 Hyundai that I really liked and it was in my payment range.  They even called me a few days later to tell me that the bank approved me for a lower APR which I was stoked about.\n\nNow the fun stuff... I get a call a few days after that and come to find out that the car they sold me belonged to someone else. Stolen or not, I don't know the full details but these asshats bacially did not do their homework.  I love how someone off the street can basically trade in a car with little to no information and Chapman turns around and sells it to me.  I had to return the car, which still smelled like cigarettes and was still needing the inspection. \n\nI did get a much nicer car for a lower price but I will never go back.  The incompetence level is epic. The finance manager (Chris) is a prick and the main manager is a shady piece of work.  All they do is apologize and keep you waiting and waiting. They seem to do everything ass backwards at this place and I will NEVER recommend anyone to buy anything there.  \n\nSo, here I have a 2010 Kia.  Let's see in a few days if THIS car is legally mine and not stolen.\n\nThen they call me again the following day to tell me that the paperwork for the original car went through and if I want it, I can have that car instead. WTF!!!?\n\nFuck that place.
