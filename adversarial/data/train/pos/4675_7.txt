I had heard a lot about this place's poutines from friends and finally tried them last night. I found the food unimpressive. Their poutine with peppers, mushrooms and onions had all the vegetables raw (you'd think they might sautee or fry the mushrooms a little, or at least the green peppers?). If you're on the Main and looking for a quick bite, it'll do, but I wouldn't go out of my way for their food.
