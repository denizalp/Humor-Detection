We waited for almost an hour even though we had a reservation. Luckily they gave us free bbt as compensation. \n\nThe food was ok. Most of the flavour comes from the sauce, which was good, but the freshness of the seafood is all gone...all gone. Overall, it was ok for the price of seafood but not that special.
