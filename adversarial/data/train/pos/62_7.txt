Solid.  Fresh noodles right now.  I pull for you. \n\nMenu is not huge but varies from pedestrian dishes like yellow curry chicken which was very mild to spicy pigs ears.\n\nI had the yellow curry chicken and while it was good I wished for heat from the curry.  Fellow yelper Kevin H had the spicy pigs ears which proved that he is more adventurous at ear chewing than I am. \n\nOverall I think China Magic Noodle House is pretty good and you can't beat fresh pulled noodles.
