The coolest expo ever! Barbies everywhere! \n\nThey have celebrities like Cher, Diana Ross, Kimora Lee and Elvis, characters from movies like Grease, The Birds, Twilight and Mary Poppins, TV shows like I Dream of Jeannie, The Flintstones and Dynasty! \n\nThey had barbies that represented eras, countries, cultures and even designer brands.\n\nAnd they have a beautiful, opulent chandelier above a water fountain. \n\nAnd there are 2 wonderful displays of moving barbies in cases that are so intricate and lovely. One is a runway scene and another is an extravagant party.\n\nLove this exhibit!
