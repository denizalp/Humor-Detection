DON'T COME HERE FOR DINNER, go for lunch!!\n\nDinner for my date and I was $101!\n\nCONS:\n-1 star off because we called to ask them what the price was for dinner on Friday and they said $41. When we got there is was actually $47 a pop. Why do you lie to me Wicked Spoon, why? This is a buffet and there is only 1 price tag for that night's meal so it does make me wonder if this was even an accident. Also there was not a lot of people there that night.\n\n-1 star off because food was MEH. Crab legs were small and too salty. Bone marrow was nothing special at all. I heard it was famous, but my mom buys beef bones at the grocery store for $1 per lbs to make soup broth and when I eat the marrow it tastes just like the ones they serve here... bland and unflavored fatty marrow. So why they are hyped up, I don't quite get. :(. Korean bbq was too salty, sushi selection was just bad. Ramen bar was super adorable but not good :(. I enjoyed the mushroom truffle pasta and all the shrimp in their dishes were very large and juicy! But overall despite the really cute and pretty display, the food did not wow me, especially for the price tag.\n\n-1 star off because of the price. For their dinner deal there was NOTHING SPECIAL HERE. Unless you count the crab legs which was really weak. I would say go here for lunch only if you pay half the price for the same thing, then that would totally be worth it.\n\nPROS:\n+1 star because the food is displayed beautifully and the little containers and mini pots for the food is soooo adorable. :3.\n\n+1 star because although the food was not up to par for $$$, the venue is gorgeous and the DESSERT BAR WAS GLORIOUS. So many options. :)
