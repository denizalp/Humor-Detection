I have seen this show twice and both times I loved it! My fella was captivated as well... until he got up to leave at intermission thinking it was over. Um, had he never seen the movie? lol\n\nAll in all, great show and everyone should take the opportunity to see this show before it leaves at the end of the year.\n\nThe staging is beautiful and I almost think it's better to be seated farther back for a better overall visual of the stage. Prices are pretty reasonable adn they often offer local discounts if you ask. It does drag a bit in the middle, but I often find that true of most musicals. Definitely a must-see.
