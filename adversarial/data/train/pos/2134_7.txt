I swear I reviewed this place...what happened? ANYWAYS, we came here post Postino's for some dessert. It was a bit busy in the evening but I wanted to take advantage of a deal I got from them. I ordered 1 scoop, and the lady working the register said I could choose two flavors and do half a scoop of each. I got double chocolate and peanut butter (without trying it first). Loved the chocolate, but the PB was not my fave, should've gotten the Vietnamese coffee. It was also a hot day and with no seating inside, we sat on the patio and raced against the clock eating our melty treats. It was actually nice though, they had misters but they didn't quite reach us. \n\nThey had a lot of cute, nostalgic candies and during cooler weather, the patio seating would be lovely.
