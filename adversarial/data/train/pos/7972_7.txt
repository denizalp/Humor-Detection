This place is not far from Christie Pits on the north east corner of Bloor and Clinton.  If you want to eat inside there are I think 5 picnic style tables so it is pretty tight in there to begin with.  You have to line up and order at the cash register and pay there and then they bring it out to your table (if you were able to get one).  \n\nIt's not that expensive for single items but usually a person like me will get like 3 or 4 different things because each item is too small for a full meal.  There are many ways to fill whatever your order whether it's burrito, tacos, etc.  Personally I like the cheese pupusa and I think they even have corn tamales.  We've had the fish before as well.\n\nIf you're a group they will bring everything to your table.  They have salsa and sides of fresh jalepenos, onions and other things for different dishes that you order that go with it such as cabbage for the pupusas.\n\nThey have Mexican sodas and beer like Dos Equis and Corona too.  Overall I'd have to say if you get a variety of items it will be something like 10 to 15 dollars a person not including drinks.  \n\nAlso it's El Salvadorian as opposed to Mexican I think.  I don't really know what the difference is but either way I like this place and I've been going for years.
