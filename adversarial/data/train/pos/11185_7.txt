Attention - Anyone who has hair...or wants nice hair....or better hair.....DEBBIE DEBBIE DEBBIE! That is the only name you need to know when you are looking to get your hair done. Her and her daughter are both hairdressers here and she is so good. I have been going to her for 3 years now and will not go to anyone else. I have followed her tiny self all over this city like batman in the night!\n\nShe recently moved to this day spa and the spa seems really nice. I have not tried any of the other services they provide but it is a very welcoming, classy environment.  They offer everything from hair, waxing, facials, peels to nail and massage. \n\nThis is a nice facility - and they are lucky to have Debbie there. Call her and tell her Tanya sent you - she will take good care of you. At least she will know who you are talking about....LOL (read previous review for Dairy Queen)\n\nHappy Hair Days girls!
