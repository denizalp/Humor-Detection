I have eaten at Papi Queso now on two different occasions while at Triple C.  I would say both times, the food was ok. \n\nHowever, for me, their grilled cheese is just not quite as good as the Ooey Gooey grilled cheese I get at Roaming Fork. \n\nI know it takes a while to prepare food to order on a food truck, but it seems to me that they are really slow at preparing their sandwiches. I want to love this place, but so far, I find it a-ok, but not great.
