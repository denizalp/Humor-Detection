This is the first auto repair shop that I have found that is HONEST!!!!!!  I mean I have NEVER had a repair shop turn my business away because my Honda Accord's rear brakes were only wore down 30%.  The DEALER (Henderson) said they were wore down 75%.  I declined the dealers recommendations and brought it to Sun Auto.  RESULT - SAVED  OVER $200.   Because SUN AUTO REPAIR  was honest!!!!!!!\n\nBut then I went back, and POW you need new struts because the others are worn out.  Checked them myself and they are fine.  I GUESS ALL mechanic shops are crooks.  I have not been able to find an honest mechanic.
