My update consist of my latest communication from a customer service stand point in response to receiving a refund.\n\nI wrote Glamour Shots to let them know I would like my money back. My exact message was the following:\n\nHello,\n\nI would like to be refunded my $30 deposit for my shoot that I cancelled via the phone with Jessica due to the terrible customer service I received from her. I do not plan on ever doing business with Glamour Shots and will have no need to apply this to future services. \n\nPlease respond to this email and let me know when I can plan on receiving a refund. \n\nThank you,\n\nAlicia \n\nI got a lovely response from Jessica. I have NEVER had anyone tell me I was a rude customer, however I don't take the cheap shot personally considering the source. I am a business major there is a tone and style when dealing with customers. Here is her response:\n\nI want to apologize for the experience and any misunderstanding we see over 100 people a week and the same protocol is done with every single customer and they understand and appreciate the things we do to make sure our sessions go great because we are very busy I have never had any of our guest be so rude so I was a little taken back as well I figured maybe it was a bad day but my receptionist stated that it was the same way at booking (which I realized as well once I read the review)  every single customer that comes through the door has the Groupon (in every state and every location) and we appreciate everyone which groupon you choose doesn't make a difference we see a variety majority have the $19 and the one you have actually comes with hair and make-up so I'm pretty sure there was a misunderstanding  just wanted to personally apologize and I wish the booking and confirmation would have went smoother we will be refunding your Deposit back to your card today\n\nBest regards!\n\nJess   \n\nI did get end up getting a refund from Glamor Shots.  Groupon kindly refunded me my money due to the circumstances. I have never had any issues like this one with any of there sellers  like this before on their site including JCPenny's portrait studio. My advice is do your homework and read reviews before trying something new.
