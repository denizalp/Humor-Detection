With a name like Salted Malted Bakery Creamery you know that yummy stuff awaits you. I believe its still their soft opening period so not everything on their menu is offered just yet. They have yummy awesome cookies for reasonable prices. Prices nowadays for cookies easily runs you $2.00 a cookie to its so refreshing to see cookies for under $1.00. Its actually $7.99 for a gourmet dozen. I love soft chewy cookies with unique flavors & the cookies at Salted Malted delivers just that. The strawberry shortcake, churro, cream cheese carrot, brownie, cookies n cream, oatmeal raisin, & potato chipper were all yummy!!! Cookie Monster would faint!!! I would like to see a lemon flavor cookie as well as a smores cookie. The Matcha Green Apple Slushy is refreshingly different with a nice green tea punch to your taste buds at the end of each sip. Looking forward to trying items not available yet on the menu like the Poutin Fries. Staff were friendly & you can sample the dole whips & slushes as well. I took a star off for the Thrifty's Ice Cream sold. When I read Salted Malted CREAMERY I was so excited because I thought that a place that calls themselves a creamery must make their own ice cream. So I was a little bummed to find out that they sold Thrifty's ice cream. I don't think Thrifty's Ice Cream is all that great & its also filled with alot of added persevatives. Sadly, we don't have many Creamery's in Las Vegas that actually make homemade ice cream. Which is weird cause its so hot here. Anyways, the cookies will continue to bring me back. I suggest to all Cookie Monsters out there to make your trek down to Salted Malted Bakery  Creamery. Say Salted Malted 10 times very fast....
