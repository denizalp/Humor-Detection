All of the stars!! Yes, sir, you get them allll!! Wowieee yes please. Okay okay I admit, I was starving so maybe the 11 Stars should really be 10, but I'm a fan. I'm quite a foodie so trust me when I say the Long Beach bowl is where it's at. The portion is the largest, go big or go home right?! The lobby beach has spicy tuna (super fresh tasting), shrimp tempura ( amazing crunch), and crab meat. My friend has the Long Beach burrito and she wished she had gotten the bowl. It comes with Guac, cucumbers, rice, crunchy chip strips and some tomatoes. Sooo good. No bathroom, only downfall. I have to pee so badly but still had time to order and eat and run to the nearest Bush, I kid I kid, I went to the fountain.
