Atrocious service. Got served a plate of shawarma. Didn't even get the peppers onions etc. This particular employee just stood there didn't ask what salad I wanted. Then he said \"choose a drink.\" with the worst attitude possible. Couldn't even say \"Would you like a drink with that?\" As if that wasn't rude enough, this guy throws the drink onto the tray, not once, but TWICE. Because he tried to charge me $2.49 for a CAN of iced tea when the screen said 600ml bottle. I asked why it was $2.49 he said it's the same for everything. Why on earth would I ever pay $2.49 for a can of pop at a food court? These guys think they're running a movie theatre? So I chose a bottle instead and again he tosses it onto the tray. I don't even care what the food tastes like after service like that. NEVER returning to this location again. I will be sure to tell everyone I know not to eat here when at Yorkdale.
