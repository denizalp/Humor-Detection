I never write review because frankly, I hate this website. Usually it's filled with nothing but whiny entitled customers ruining the reputation of a family owned business because they didn't get their damn burrito out fast enough. \n\nHowever, I had to make an exception with uber.\n\nUber is SO UNRELIABLE. ITS IMPOSSIBLE to plan a trip ahead of time because I swear EVERY SINGLE TIME I order an uber there's REDICULOUS surge pricing. 2.1 times the normal rate on a Tuesday at 2:00pm? REALLY? \n\nIt's come to the point where I am just so frustrated I uninstalled the app. Use to use them very frequently but I swear every single time nowadays there is surge pricing. Not everybody can afford that. Especially us, with my pregnant girlfriend it's imperative we get to our appointments and on time and every dollar spent could be used towards our first child's care.\n\nI do have the money but I REFUSE to pay three times the rate when I'm going 10 miles to her doctor's. A trip that would cost $15 is now $60.\n\nTherefore, uber is UBER UNRELABLE.\n\nStop being so greedy uber. Your drivers are nothing but your sheep, and you treat them that way. But I feel like soon enough they will realize this and move on. One can only hope.\n\nSPEAK WITH YOUR WALLETS PEOPLE
