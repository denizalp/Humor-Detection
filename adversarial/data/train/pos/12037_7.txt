1 star and they don't even deserve that.  The combination of p*ss poor customer service and mediocre food leaves me never wanting to come back.  We attended this place on July 3rd and had a reservation at 9:00.  I requested a booth a week in advance, but they couldn't even accommodate that.   Let's just get straight to the review.\n\nFood\/Service\n\nOur waiter was no were to be seen most of the night.  We ordered a few drinks and couple of appetizers to start.  Black Truffle cheese fritters and calamari.  Both were ok, and the portions are a joke.  Most nice restaurants serve some sort of calamari dish and for what you pay here is down right insulting.  There were probably 6 to 7 pieces, seriously WTF.  For dinner we order the Filet Mignon and porterhouse steak.  My fiancee requested it medium well and I wanted my steak medium rare.  Her steak was served rare and mine was overcooked on the medium well side.  SMH.  Our sides were a potato gratin and creamed corn dish.  Once again they serve it in a little dish and the flavors were nothing special.  Our waiter said he would bring us out bread, but that never happened.  I had to request my coke to be filled up several times and had to stack the dirty plates for them to finally take it away.  Seriously, where is the customer service?  I snapped couple of pics, didn't even want to waste my time, but posting anyway.\n\nNot the most memorable nice dinners I've had in a while.  For the food that they serve they are not an elite or top steakhouse in the valley.  They are more like a Keg's Steakhouse, Longhorns, or Flemings.  For a great steak and experience, I would recommend Mastro's, Dominick's (Scottsdale Quarter) or Donovan's.\n\nReport Card=F!!!
