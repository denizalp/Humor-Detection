The best part about being a girl in Vegas is getting in to all the clubs for free. XS is awesome because it is large and has a good amount of crowd. The line to get in was long for guest lists but moved quickly.\n\nOne thing I didn't like as much was that we didn't get a crap load of free drinks tickets like we did at Light. I guess that was good considering there were swimming pools all around and I would have probably fallen into one like my friend did if I had any more to drink.\n\nSunday nights are pool party nights so bring your swimsuit. The place is huge so you have plenty of places to hang out and there are even spots to sit down. I like that it was busy but not overly crowded.\n\nThe staff isn't all that friendly. My friend had to look through her phone for our promoters name and the girl yelled at us saying that we should have been ready. It was also super hard to get service at the bar.
