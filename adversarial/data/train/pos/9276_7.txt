@TOFoodInspector #YELPTO\n\nI am unlikely to ever use my \"Elite\" status on Yelp, but I am hoping my review is the first one to pop up here. This review is really just a warning. DO NOT EAT HERE. \n\nYelp wasn't bringing many results for \"Biryani\" near my place. This was one of them. It was a cold night. I had a few friends over. And the pizza concept was getting old. So I thought, why not order some biryani! We all excitedly agreed over this idea. Having lived in GTA, a biryani craving is legit mouth-watering when you know what to expect. \n\nThe biryani arrived looking like nothing that we expect. It was soggy, bright yellow in color, with some bright green pieces of rice as well. In other words, unappetizing. Then, we started eating it. And the whole thing was stale. 4 boxes of it. STALE. \n\nI called the place to complain. Obviously, nobody cares when things have been paid and done for. But I had to complain because this was absolutely unacceptable. The guy over the phone informed that the biryani was cooked 11am in the morning. So, that apparently clearly \"justifies\" why the biryani must have not tasted fresh at 9pm. I tried explaining that it was stale - like a day old, maybe more - STALE. And he handed the phone over to his cook; who then informed me that this is their process day in and day out and nobody has ever complained about their food. That they cook it in the morning, and serve it till 2am everyday. If this is indeed true, which it shouldn't be if you're running a business in Toronto, something's totally wrong with their preservation process. He kindly offered to add in a bit extra for free next time I ordered from them. Well. THAT IS NEVER HAPPENING. You think I'll ever order again? I'd be crazy to.\n\nIf I die from food poisoning tonight, you know what happened. #deathnote\nCan I complain about this anywhere? anyone? Do advise if you're reading this.
