Hands down the best Japanese curry restaurant in Las Vegas. We stopped in after a movie and the place was busy. They pushed two tables together for us since we were a party of three. Very nice of them. \n\nWe started with waters and a calipico drink. For our meals the girls ordered fried tofu with curry, and chicken katsu with corn topping spicy curry #5 for myself.\n\nThe food came out quickly and we enjoyed every last bite. Check out the pics if you don't believe how good it is here.\n\nWe saw some menu items we might have to try on our next visit to Chinatown. They had chicken karage, curry udon (sounds interesting), shumai and tako taki. All sounded good but too full to sample them this trip.\n\nArigato Zen Japanese curry!
