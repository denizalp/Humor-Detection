The Good:\n\n-Chicken Noodle Soup (they keep the egg noodles and soup separate to prevent mooshy noodles, WOOHOO!)\n\n-Matzoh Ball Soup (same chicken soup but with a fluffy matzoh ball, could be hotter, but it's tasty)\n\n-Beef & Cheddar Melt (they loaded it up with meat and cheese on both buns and toast them, and then you tell them what veggies you'd like, I say EVERYTHING)\n\n-Turkey Toaster with added Bacon (much better than their Club)\n\n-Smoked Ham & Colby Jack Cheese (it's a bit salty, but the green chilies make this sandwich good, get this with potato salad to cut the salt factor)\n\n-Classic Turkey Club (your average club, it's hefty and filling)\n\n-Sam & Emma's (even more hefty and filling, lots of meat, mmmmm meat...)\n\n-New York Sky High (similar to Sam & Emma's, meaty, ask for cole slaw on the side so your sandwich doesn't get soggy)\n\n\nThe Bad:\n\nWell there really isn't anything bad, they sometimes run out of a certain type of meat though.  (hence the 4 stars, but it really should be 4.5)\n\nAlso, I recommend getting the potato salad versus chips because they give you the single serve Lay's Potato Chip bags and that's just full of more salt, just saying.  So, happy eatings everyone!!
