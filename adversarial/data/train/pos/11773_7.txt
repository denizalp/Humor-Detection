Debated on whether or not to write this review, but am still so pissed, I feel like people should be warned. \n\nI contacted the owner of High Noon about doing a white ink tattoo & was referred to Rocky. Rocky agreed to do the tattoo, no questions asked. \n\nI showed up to the appt., where I learned that his young daughter Ruby would be joining us for the tattoo (Strike 1). \n\nI wanted the tattoo in the very center of my back and asked if he could please enclose the area since I'd have to take off my bra and shirt. He asked why and insisted I keep it all on, and that I get the tattoo in the very center of the shop (Strike 2). How do you get perspective of where the center of someone's back is, if they have all their clothes on?!\n\nI showed him the VERY EASY AND SIMPLE tattoo I wanted, where I wanted it, and we went from there. He had to redo the transfer 4 times because he couldn't understand where I wanted it. Then, when we got the spot right, he started rubbing some of it off with alcohol claiming that the ink would seep into the tattoo (Strike 3- if he was an expert, he would have used a yellow Sharpie to go over the lines, and\/or not erased the lines!).\n\nHe questioned if I knew the \"risks\" of white ink and I showed him my other white ink tattoo and that I was WELL aware of the side effects (fading, etc.). He said he was really impressed with how well I took care of it.\n\nThen, he started the tattoo. His daughter would not leave me alone (Strike 4)!! She kept talking and cracking jokes and I felt extremely uncomfortable to be in a situation where I'd have to tell the dude to make his kid leave, so I didn't. I foolishly went along with it despite his obvious distraction.\n\nHe did the tattoo in 10 minutes. I asked if he wanted to go over it a couple of times, knowing that that's how you get the white really bright. He said no. I asked again. He said no. I got up to look at it. Couldn't get a good look at it. I had to actually ask the jerk for another mirror so I could get a glimpse of it (Strike 5). He barely wanted to wrap the tattoo, but I requested it (Strike 6).\n\nHe asked for my cash, I tipped him $20 and left. An hour later, I asked someone to take a photo of it and saw how much he fucked it up. The guy's lines were CROOKED, and HE COULDN'T EVEN DRAW THE LINES LONG ENOUGH TO MATCH THE PHOTO!!\n\nI texted him with my concerns and here're his lame excuses:\n\"The picture of the tattoo isn't perfectly flat, so it's a little distorted. Also, the spine is concave which would make some of the lines look different. Also, the tattoo is fresh and swollen which will distort it. Give it at least a week or so to heal up a bit.\" (Strike 6)\n\nA week later, I call him out and tell him that he didn't match the image AT ALL and how disappointed I was. I asked if he knew anyone in LA who could do him a solid and fix his mistakes.\n\nHis response: \n\"Sorry you feel that way, I thought we were clear on the risk with white tattoos. In hindsight, I should have done it knowing you didn't live here and couldn't touch it up. I don't know anyone off hand in LA, there are plenty of shops out there. If you're ever in Phoenix, I'll fix it. Sorry again.\"\n\nNewsflash: the white ink has NOTHING to do with not being able to draw a straight line, nor does where I live! I told him that I'd hate to think his daughter distracted him, but in the future when someone asks you to go over the lines again, you should yes. Because this could've been avoided and fixed.\n\nHis response:\n\"Sorry you're so angry. Just write me a bad yelp review. You'll feel better after that promise [peace sign emoji]\/.\"(Strike 1,394,372)\n\nIS HE FUCKING SERIOUS?! So basically, the guy can't draw lines, is extremely unprofessional, takes no pride in his work, and blamed it on the white ink. He should have not only offered me a refund, but tried to help me find a place to fix it and\/or offered to pay for the touch-up! I'm beyond disappointed and am just glad it's an easy fix. \n\nIf you have a choice of people to get ink from, AVOID ROCKY AT ALL COSTS. And if you have to go to him, do not let him erase the transfer, have him do the tattoo in a quiet place, remove your clothes if you want ink under them, and tell him to leave his daughter at home! SO FUCKING UNPROFESSIONAL.
