Make A Cake has been around as long as I can remember.  I have spent quite a bit of time here, and there is everything you could need for cake and candy making and decorating.  They also have a decent selection of candy.\n\nI remember buying bags of chocolate to melt for chocolate covered pretzels as a kid, and the prices here are really reasonable for these things.  Now, I mostly pop in here to pick up things to decorate cakes.  I made a beach birthday cake one year, and my mom made me bear themed cakes one year.  We picked up all of my decorations here both times so the selection is fairly wide.\n\nThey stock holiday themed candy!\n\nThe actual store is pretty small so obscure things might be harder to get here.\n\nIf you have a question, the employees are very friendly, both in person and on the phone!  So you should definitely take care of your baking needs here!
