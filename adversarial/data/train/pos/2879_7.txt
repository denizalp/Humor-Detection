to all those haters out there slamming britbrit for lipsyncing, you try dancing your heart out at age 35 for 80 minutes straight and let us know how you do (i can barely stand for 80 minutes at the show).\n\nmy friend and i made it a mission to watch britney before her residence at ph ends...  though an expensive mission, but well worth it.\n\nwe got the rh standing room \/ pit area and you couldn't get any closer to her!  i didn't realize the theater would be SO big, so if you have nosebleed seats, maybe bring some binoculars if you want to see the details.  the best seats however, are definitely the bottle service area.  the crowd with seats stood for the whole entire show, so if you're gonna stand for the whole show, as mind as well stand closer to her... lol.\n\nthe overall performance \/ execution exceeded my expectations, but i wished her outfits would be more than just lingerie in different colors...  her body looks amazing and all, but lingerie in different colors and cuts gets old fast.\n\ni love the themes and the overall transition from song to song, though some classic songs were missed, but who am i kidding, i love all her songs!\n\nher backup dancers really made the show.  they're super energetic and enthusiastic, and they were all dancing just as hard as britney.\n\nsecurity and overall entrance \/ exit was smooth.  the ph staff got the crowd into the theater at a rapid pace (cue brit: all moving at a rapid pace), everyone has to walk through metal detectors that existed before the shooting.  you can tell security is definitely a top priority there because there are plenty of movements from the security team and they're always on the lookout for suspicious \/ dangerous activities.  so i definitely felt safe.\n\nanyways, catch her before jlo \/ bsb takes over completely!
