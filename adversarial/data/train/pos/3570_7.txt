This will be quick and painless.\n\nJust kidding. It'll only be quick. \n\nCame in and expected it to be the same as the Volcano Tea House location on Spring Mtn closer to the strip, EHHH (game show buzzer noise) wrong. Thought I could pay for my small mango green tea with my cc, EHHHH wrong again -- minimum $10 charge. Expecting it to taste like the usual mango green tea I order at all tea houses.. EHHHHH very wrong -- wayyyyy too sweet. \n\nTHREE STRIKES. I'M OUT.  LATERSSS! \n\nLOL I feel a little bad.. for being so quick to dismiss. Honestly though, there was a small selection on the menu, my friend's milk tea was not up to par (tea was bland & boba was not good period), and the boba-rista should've taken both our orders first and then start on the drinks rather than take it one by one and make it one by one. Just took too much time and wasn't doing much for the experience that already started on a 'meh' note.\n\nUPDATE 9\/26\/2012: \nHonestly after reading my review over, I feel like this place at least deserves two stars, possibly even three (depending on 2nd try) rather than one. it's not that terrible of a place to where I wouldn't give it a 2nd shot. BUT a few days later after I posted this review, the owner contacted me in a very unprofessional way, so I'm leaving it at 1 for the service.
