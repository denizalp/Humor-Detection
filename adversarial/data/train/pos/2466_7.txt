Las Vegas has so many \"#1 in Las Vegas BBQ,\" \"featured on xxy TV show BBQ,\" \"voted best of Las Vegas BBQ\" joints that you wonder which one really is the best. Let me tell you, Pot Liquor CAS is my favorite. If you're thinking for that authentic BBQ experience (styrofoam boxes, lard and plastic checkerboard table cloth) than Pot Liquor won't be your place. If you're looking for a BBQ place that is a little fancier Pot Liquor is your place. \nPark near the movie theaters in Town Square and the place is right next door. The restaurant has been empty the times I've been (weeknights, weekends) so no need for a reservation. \nWhats the Deal with the Chicken and the Beef: It comes with brisket, pulled pork and chicken. 2 corn breads are included and you get a choice of 2 sides. The pulled pork and brisket were AMAZING. The chicken was a little dry. The corn bread and honey butter were so good, that I wouldn't be against ordering more corn bread for your side ;) Collared greens were good, but if I'm going to eat my vegetables I want them to be in a more healthy form. Mac N Cheese and french fries were both good. \nIf you're looking for a dress up for dinner BBQ place come to pot liquor. If you're looking for a BBQ place you can go to in sweats, skip it.
