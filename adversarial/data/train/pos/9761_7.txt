Came here because it's near my gym I go to. I have been seeing a lot of picture feed on my Instagram as well from a Vegas Foodie ( cookie in a jar ). I decided to go with the the mini 9 for $5.95 --- what a steal! Also in the front there are mini sample sugar cookies for free! This was nice for my son, since as we were passing by this place when I was trying to go to another store nearby, he was calling out for a cookie. Friendly service, different choices, the sugar cookies I got were fresh, and it wasn't like those sugar cookies with the frosting you would get a grocery store, cookies melt in your mouth, frosting wasn't as super sweet, it's better! I will definitely be back if I'm craving a legit sugar frosted sugar cookie!
