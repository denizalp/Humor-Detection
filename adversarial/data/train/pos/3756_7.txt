I love many things. But it's a rare find to have true passion for something. If it wasn't evident in my past reviews, I have a passion for good food. My other passion? Mine heart belongs to shoes.\n\nWorking in the Queen\/John area I've walked passed Scarpino almost every day and every day for the past 5ish years, I glance or marvel at the window. Or on a slack work day, I may give the small store a quick lap. Why, you may ask? This is how I flirt with shoes. Let me have my fun!\n\nTruth be told, I was always reluctant to shop here for fear of pricey shoes and snobby store clerks. Yes, the shoes cost a bit but no more than any other shoe boutique of its kind. I just need to tell myself I do not NEED to buy shoes no matter how much I WANT them. And the staff were so friendly and helpful as I fell in love with a pair of hot pink (among other colours), canvas, open toe, sling back 3-inch heels (brand: Buygo if you're interested). They're hotter than that description makes them out to be.\n\nPlus, I saw a couple of new pairs of heels recently that were trying to seduce me. I was a little stronger today.
