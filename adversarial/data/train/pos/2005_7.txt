Made a quick appliance purchase and paid hundreds less than expected. They have typical pricing, but the occasional irresistable deal. \n\nOne criticism I have is the pushiness of the sales people. They make no bones about the fact that they work on commission and remind you constantly. They try to guilt you a little due to business being slow since they opened, and if you don't give them a good review on the satisfaction survey, they will be \"on the chopping block.\"
