I have never, ever, walked out of a restaurant before... ever.  Went for a quick bite and went to a place we love by our house... \"The Sushi\" was amazing: great chefs, good ambiance, fantastic service.  Tonight the door had a new sign, but same menu which was suspect.  The place was very loud and busy, like a family and friends party at the bar.  We got our drinks (water) and ordered a couple AYCE items.  Seaweed salad and gyoza were fine, but once our nigiri came out (not exactly what we ordered but hey, close enough) we still were waiting on plates, wasabi, soy sauce, etc. We attempted multiple times to flag anyone down to no avail (just to ask for some plates and wasabi) but were awkwardly avoided.\n\nNo kidding 15 minutes goes by and we're still trying to flag someone down the whole time.  The nigiri is just sitting there while waving and attempting to flag down anyone working.  15+ minutes with no service at an AYCE is terrible.  Empty waters, no service, nothing to eat our sushi with.  Meanwhile the party at the bar continues with the chefs doing shots with friends at the bar.  Our maybe waiter who greeted and sat us was polite and running around trying to keep up with the 4-5 other tables, but continued to avoid us even after saying he would be \"right back\" 15 or so minutes after we flagged him down. \n\nBottom line, this place needs to get their game together if they want to stay open.  As locals, we'll never go back.  It's too bad \"The Sushi\" closed and was replaced by this joke.
