So I really like this place. They can do no wrong honestly. This would be my steakhouse of choice all the time if I can afford it.\nThe waitress knows exactly what I order without me having to stutter thru it.\nI really appreciate that.\nHeres what to order , pay attention:\nStart with the french onion soup, then get the hyde wedge salad no bacon ( because we dont eat swine).\nThen get the NY strip medium well, with a side of creamed corn , no pancetta ( again cuz we dont eat swine) and the potato au graten as 2 ala cart sides. Each side feeds 3 people.\nI dont eat fish so I cant help you there.\nTell them Moe sent you.
