...and they just charged us again.\nDO NOT do business with this company, they can not be trusted.  No integrity.\nAfter repeated contact with them, and a 'well you canceled the day before the fee cycle' last month, and a 'this is a cancellation fee' that we paid last month, I find that we are again charged a monthly fee.  This is just plain fraudulent.  Now we have to contact our bank to report this as a fraudulent charge and report Smart Gym as a disreputable business.  \nAll of this ordeal for the last few months, just to cancel a membership to this gym.  A gym that I have never even set foot in (wife signed me up).  \nI can't comment about the quality of the training or the equipment, but even if that is all top of the line, what good is any of it if they have no integrity and can't be trusted with your account information?\n\nWe have been repeatedly and intentionally deceived, and I find that unacceptable.
