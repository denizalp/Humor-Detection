Fifth time I've come here after 1pm and been offered no options for food. Sold out of cookies, sold out of all sandwiches and specials.\n\nWhy stay open till 7pm daily if you're constantly running out of food? Save yourself the staffing and operational costs by closing immediately after the weekday lunch rush.\n\nAnother way to tell that they're sold out of food is that no one will help you at the cash. I practically had to go back into the kitchen and bring out an employee myself. The attitude seems to be \"We're out of stock of pretty much everything, so there's no point in even greeting you since we'll decline every request you make.\" I get the impression they hope customers will take a hint and not even bother asking?\n\nTIP: Make more food?
