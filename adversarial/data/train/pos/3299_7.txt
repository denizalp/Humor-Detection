David David David....Two sides to every coin.  Mr. Copperfield has acquired a lifetime of success doing \"illusions\" or tricking people into believing one thing while he does another (I'm not terribly fond of magic, but can be entertained).  You can tell he's been doing it wayyyyyyyyyyyyy too long, he just didn't seem into it............at all.  It's as though he was on auto-pilot.  \n\nThere were a few cool tricks, especially when the car appears on the stage (sweet ride btw).  \n\nHowever, I laughed quite heartily through out the show.  He had a few parts that almost caused me to fear bladder problems.  Would I have paid for tickets if I didn't get them comped? Umm, no. \n\nBefore he 'appeared' on stage, there was a tedious \"DAVID COPPERFIELD\" tribute video, it was cool the first few minutes...but daaaaang dude, ease up, we don't need to see every SINGLE show clip that your name was mentioned in.\n\nIt was ok.  I think he's a handsome older man, but his fake hair was awfully distracting.  Thirty minutes of the show was spent trying to figure out if it was sprayed on or astro-turf.
