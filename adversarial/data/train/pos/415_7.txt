3.5 stars\n\nWhen the gigantic, hydraulic-controlled windows are swung open, letting in a faint breeze & noises from the strip two floors below, it is a real treat to sit at the restaurant's perimeter. Nearing closing time, the windows were slammed shut, & there went all of our ambiance (literally out the window.) Something about the lovely natural elements detracted from the air-con, set to full blast, & the overly simplistic decor which lacked character. Weather permitting, keep them windows open!\n\nThe dessert cart rolled by several times, tempting me. When I finally tried all three cookies (lemon, chocolate chip\/ricotta, PB with blackberry jam), a bite of blueberry eclair, & a spoonful of dark chocolate amaretti cake, I was disappointed that they had tasted no better than a run-of-the-mill buffet dessert (at triple the cost.) \n\nTwo appetizers stood out as phenomenal: bacon-wrapped dates were sticky & plump, and crostini w\/ ricotta, honey, lemon, & pink peppercorns were addictive bites of sweet & savory; the olive oil drizzle was magnificent & (I assume) a high quality one. \n\nHe enjoyed the salumi (bresaola & proscuitto) and cheese (parmesan & mozzarella) platter. The sage honey & spicy grain mustard accompaniaments were especially delicious. \n\nThumbs up for his rack of lamb. I chose farroto (faro) with fava beans, morels, & pecorino, which was extremely salty, & not up to par with the other amazing items we tried. \n\nI'd be hard-pressed to recommend; just another celebrity chef getting paid to throw her name on a Vegas eatery.
