I've been here a few times for happy hour, but this was my first dinner experience. I would say overall for a happy hour meal it's a solid 3 stars. Great deals on beer, and average rolls that'll appease a craving. \n\nThe dinner experience is more deserving of 2 stars, but I rounded up. The quality of the food doesn't align with their regular prices.\n\nWe ordered Gyoza to start. The skin was soft and steamed but it was the blandest little bugger I've had, and it was slightly cold. I then ordered the Lemongrass Pork and I got really confused. It was supposed to be a noodle dish, but it was 60% iceberg lettuce, the pork was super dry as well. At least what few noodles I had were good and I liked the sauce.  Nick wasn't impressed with his dish either. Too little shrimp, not enough spice. The bartender was such a sweetheart though, and the beers were good. Oh well, sometimes a place is only meant for happy hour visits (shoulder shrug).
