Intium seems like the offspring of someone who had too many ideas. \"I want to open a hair salon! Oh...but people like coffee right? Let's add a cafe! What if people want to sing? Throw in some karaoke!\" \n\nI had heard a lot about the hair salon\/cafe combination, but the karaoke came as a surprise to me. Some friends and I came to the cafe side on a Saturday night (hair salon's closed). It's a cozy space with enough room for 3-4 large groups. The drinks themselves are on the pricey end and I think you're paying for the art on top more than the drink itself. A bunch of us ordered green tea lattes and while delicious, they weren't anything extraordinary. Latte art was on point though.\n\nThe karaoke wasn't like an actual karaoke place. It's more like they have a giant wall projection and screens with karaoke capabilities. If anyone wants to sing, take a mic and go for it! The servers are very open to it (the other customers' tolerance would depend on your singing ability, I guess). \n\nThere was another review saying they didn't like that the servers were doing karaoke among themselves. I guess they thought it detracted from the cafe experience. On the contrary, I found this really fun! It's like you're in a giant room with friends and everyone just wants to get their song on. I didn't think it really hurt the service, and it definitely boosted the atmosphere. It really showed that these people enjoyed working there and that translated to some great attitudes. \n\nI think the other two groups that were in the cafe at the time actually knew the owners and we were the only random customers. We weren't given inferior treatment because of this though. \n\nThe servers were all very friendly. At one point, we were encouraged to \"not be shy\" and my guy friend took this very much to heart, belting out an enthusiastic manly rendition of \"Let It Go\". Surprisingly, everyone was still nice to us after the singing! I think that in itself, warrants repeat visits.\n\n(51\/100) - 2016
