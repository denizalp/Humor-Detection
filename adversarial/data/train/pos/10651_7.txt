This place was relatively dirtier but used to be a better place to play.  It used to offer 100x odds on craps.  Now they don't, but they do still have $3 minimum bets and a single deck blackjack table.\n\nCorrection : They do have those machine craps that offer 5x odds and $2 minimum.  Probably the best on the strip.\n\nNow without the crapless craps and 100x odds, I have no reason to recommend this place.  I think people would rather play in a nice upscale casino where the drinks are brought over often and the serious players would go elsewhere.\n\nIt's just a dirty looking place.  Even when you win, you are in this dark purple cave and don't know what you're walking on.\n\nTonight, I overheard someone at the bar saying how some guy customer was biting her.  I also saw a worker\/security yelling at a girl to get the F*** out! (I'd assume was a prostitute soliciting?).\n\nIt's a matter of time before somebody buys this place out and builds something that matches the strip.
