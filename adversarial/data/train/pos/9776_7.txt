First impressions are everything and Jake did not make a very good one.  It sounded good and apparently many people think so otherwise we would not have waited 30 minutes for a table. We ordered the Scallops for an appetizer. You only get 3 or 4 scallops, though they are big. I ordred the wings, but I can't review them since they were out of them?!  Well thats okay I was looking forward to the biscuits, but I can't review those either because...they were OUT of them. Well we said at least we'll have room for dessert, but guess what?  Yep. OUT (all 10 of them)!  I got the pork chop for my entre with a \"Dollop\" of mashed potatoes. The pork chop was presented well surrounded by lots of white plate.  This is a good meal for maybe a first date where you don't want to eat too much or perhaps anorexics.   This place is going to be on Diners, Drive-ins and Dives and I'm sure it will look awesome on TV, but I won't be back.  Oh and they did have dessert. A big healthy portion of \"Check\"
