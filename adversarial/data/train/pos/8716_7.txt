Yelps 365 Review Challenge 2014 - Los Angeles #46 - #365\n\nDid you know that, SW are initials for Steve Wynn?\n\nExecutive Chef: David Wolzag \n\nThat's right! Most of his restaurants are names after famous Chefs who grace most of Steve Wynn's fine dining spots but he wanted to mark his name in one of his restaurants. \n\nMe and my friend were thinking about eating in a nice fancy restaurant after our Le Reve (The Dream) show and decided to eat at SW Steakhouse, plus they had a great view of the lake show. The Steakhouse is located next to Parasol Down, just take the curved escalator down to the Lake of Dreams and it will be located on your left side. We made reservations but still had to wait for a table, I thought was unacceptable, the wait ended being 30 minutes, plus we were a little late so that was a major factor. \n\nThe clientele is very classy and mostly an older crowd as Steve Wynn targets for his world renowned resorts. Our server was very friendly and bubbly and made us feel comfortable during our dining experience. He asked us what we would like to drink and we said, \"Ice cold water\" than he started explaining different kinds of water from non carbonated to carbonated, it was just confusing but a fun experience. We were seated right next to the lake show and we enjoyed the view from our table as we ate and drank our $$$$ meal! Sadly, we requested to eat on the patio but they said it's not permitted because of the hot summer weather, which would ruin the ambiance our dining experience. \n\nWe ordered: \n\n+ Steve's Chopped Salad $17  - Avocado, crisp potatoes, Dijon vinaigrette\n\n+Roasted Skuna Baked Salmon $36  - White asparagus, fava beans, whole grain mustard sauce\n\n+Fillet Mignon 9 ounces  $54 - Aged Nebraska Corn-Fed beef is 100% USDA Prime\n\nWe were blown away from the presentation to the taste of the food, this was truly the fine dining experience we were looking for, especially at Wynn.  I will definitely  be back to try more items on the menu and experience the classiness that is of Wynn Resorts.
