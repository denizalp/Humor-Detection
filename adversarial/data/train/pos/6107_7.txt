I am a native Pittsburgher, but my soul belongs in the south with soul food and all that other good stuff!\n\nAfter celebrating the end of finals, I sauntered over to East End brewing with some friends. After a few tastings, we decided we were hungry for some RIBS. \n\nOff we ventured into the cold, the wind cuttting like shrapnel as we traverse the path from East End to showcase. Our foray towards the smoked barbeque glory would have made Edward Hillary proud. Our heads looking down to the ground, and holding on to our caps, we continued in single file and single purpose.\n\nShowcase was a beacon of light, reminscent of the smoldering campfire in the middle of the woods to ease weary travellers. The equipment was simplistic, half drum smokers wafting a delicious and time honored recipe into our nostrils. As we huddled inside, taking in our surroundings, we saw that other travelers of all walks of life underwent the same pilgrimage to this protein laden Mecca. \n\nSamples of ribs, greens, turkey legs, and macaroni and cheese were passed around in a communion to the gods of barbeque. \n\nMoist and succulent morsels dimmed the conversation to non verbal affirmations and murmurs of delight between mouthfuls.\n\nThe staff was pleasant, undertaking their holy work with gusto and pride.\n\nShowcase, \n\nI am a believer.
