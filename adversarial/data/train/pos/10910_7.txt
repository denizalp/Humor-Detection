I would just like to share that the University of Nevada Las Vegas is a horrible college and, in my opinion, should not be considered a certified university. \nMy major as an undergraduate is Elementary Education. I have been an A student since arriving at UNLV. I currently hold 143 credits, when you only are required 122 to graduate. I passed both the PRAXIS tests with flying colors. \nThey kicked me out of my Student Teaching on the basis of drama and things that people thought I \"might have said.\" I was unable to graduate when I was supposed to, which was last Fall, because of this. They told me I had to take an F on my transcript and retake it in the Spring. My GPA has now dropped to a 3.0.\nThen, they did not place me at a new school this Spring even after I had enrolled in the course and I had all my prerequisites in line. They didn't even tell me that I was supposed to be placed until the week of. I even found a placement for myself and they refused. \nOn top of all this, they placed a charge on my account of a whopping $2600 due to the fact that I was not in attendance during my Student Teaching and I had to repay UNLV for my student loans that were unused. \nI finally paid off the balance today using credit cards. They informed me at the beginning of this month that if I did not pay it off by April 1, I would be unable to graduate, even though I was not aware of this balance until mid-January.\nThey are a bunch of money hungry imbeciles that abuse their students and take away opportunities for educational expansion. I am currently broke and unable to teach because they decided in my last semester that I was unfit to be a teacher. I have been mistreated and disrespected more than I ever thought possible. \nThey have left this almost graduate poor, without a chance of a career when I have worked five years to get where I am-- which is, precisely, nowhere.
