I could tell you in detail why they only get 3 stars, but I am not in the mood to blast them because I could do some damage. All I will say is food is on point for the most point. I will always vouch for their pozole. They have pretty good fajitas and steak bowls. \n\nService on the other hand. Management needs to step up their scheduling game. Having 2 servers handle a restaurant during the lunch rush hour is really retarded. You had the bartender serving tables as well which led to the servers making their own drinks. Having our food show up before our drinks and waiting over 10 mins for chips and salsa is just awful. Server was nice and apologetic but that can only get you far.\n\nPlease work on this, I'd really love to give you another star...
