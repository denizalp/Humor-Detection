Dudes and dudettes - I want to give this place 5 stars or 3 stars! I don't know what to do!\n\nAfter reading David's review, I had to go and try the lamb shank.  I walked in and the place was very quiet.  There are some slight cracks in the flooring, but place was nicely decorated and furnished.  However, when you walk in, you are hit with a big grill\/food smell and some people may like that, but I prefer not to smell like my food.  In addition, there is no wall menu, and the cashier (at first) seemed very distant.  So for service and atmosphere 2.5\/5.  \n\nBut I didn't dine in, I did takeout.  I knew I had to do takeout the moment I walked in because I don't like to smell like food or else I'd end up eating myself.  I digress.  So yeah, ordered the lamb shank with rice.\n\nThe lamb shank was very tasty and was fall off the bone.  I can see why David likes it a lot.  The rice was more sweet and while not my style, I just added their hot sauce to it. The hot sauce is more of a Chinese style hot pepper sauce that you might see at a congee place, but it goes very well with the rice. Delicious.  So food 5\/5.  \n\nI guess that means on average, that's a 3.75\/5, and I'll round up to 4 since its a small business and I want to support them.
