Came here recently with a group of 9 on a Thursday night to celebrate a birthday.  At first when entering the place looked dead on the first floor bar area where you enter.  Once we were led upstairs we realized pretty much all the tables were full.  The place stayed pretty busy until we left at around 10.  I really liked the decor and feel, rustic but still modern.  Most of us in the group had been to their other location so we knew pretty much what to expect.  However this time we all agreed that the food was better than we remembered.  I think that is a great sign for a second location that hasn't been open long.  \n\nService was pretty good, they gave us time to order and the food came out pretty quick.  We had been drinking so we were a little loud and slow but it did not phase the staff much.  There were a couple times we needed something and it a look a few minutes to find one of the two people helping our table, but we didn't mind.  \n\nAll of the food I tried was well seasoned\/sauced and cooked nicely.  I started with a special for the day, fried green tomatoes with rock shrimp.  The shrimp tasted fresh and the sauce tied everything together well.  For dinner I had mussels which also tasted fresh and were served with a broth that was real good but I can't remember what was in it.  I also got the opportunity to try the hanger steak which was juicy and accompanied by a tasty sauce, the wings which are always solid, and the dessert given to the birthday girl, a coconut cake which was quickly consumed by everyone.  Can't wait to return.
