This is a solid Mexican food place you need to try.\n\nIf you're driving up dont let the exterior fool you, It's nice on the inside and this place was nearly packed at 5pm on a Tuesday. \n\nI called ahead and ordered the chicken fajita burrito and I was there within 10 minutes to pick it up right as it came out of the kitchen.\n\nThe burrito came with rice, beans, chips, and salsa. I opted for the Caesar salad for a small amount extra. \n\nThe burrito was large and good, served wet with melted cheese with sour cream and guac on the side.  The rice and beans were ok, and the Caesar salad was not worth the extra dollar or so, I'd suggest you pass on that. \n\nThe yelp reviews on this place are pretty accurate based on my experience
