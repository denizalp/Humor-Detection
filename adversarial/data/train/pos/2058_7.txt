I have rented with Fox Rent A Car for years and have never expected good customer service from them either. But my last experience with them was by far the worst! First thing the agent (Robert) asked me after I gave him my ID was \"Basic coverage? or Full coverage?\" I told him, \"no coverage\". Two minutes of silence went by, he tried to convince me that my personal insurance and visa card insurance does not cover rental cars. After I still declined the coverage, he then asked for my proof of insurance. I asked him, \"why does he need it? is this required by law? and that he is the first Fox Rent A Car agent to ask\". His response was, \"well it is so I could put it in my system in case something happens to the car, we ARE going to sue you!\" ok.. was that a threat? \nI still declined their insurance coverage. Also, I paid for a intermediate car. When I went outside to retrieve the car, another Fox Rent A Car worker told me I reserved a Compact car. Oh I know I did not. After I compared my email itinerary\/price I paid for with the handwritten \"compact\" car that Robert wrote, I went back inside the building but to another agent since Robert was no longer at the counter. The agent corrected it, and as I walked out of the building, Robert was in the vehicle aggressively drove out of a parking spot near me.
