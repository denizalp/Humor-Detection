I waited over 3 hours in this office. I finally walked out and was never seen. I have never been to a doctors office like this in my life. Unless you are pregnant you will wait til every pregnant woman is seen. After waiting in the lobby for two hours then they sent me to a room and came in two different times before having me disrobe for my exam. I left before that point. The doctor was on his phone at the desk while  a student came in and asked several more questions to kill even more time. Terrible practice. I'd rather pay cash somewhere else than go here and use my insurance. What does that tell you?\nAWFUL. I should have listened to my friend that went to him once in the past and said she waited almost 3 1\/2 hours to even be called back. Apparently this is the norm at that office.
