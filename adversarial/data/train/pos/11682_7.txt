Burrito snobs beware - this place is not for you. The tortilla's gonna break, one bite'll be nothing but Guac, next, rice, you won't find your Add Jalapenos until the very end and fry your tongue on them and leftover, burrito-bottom Tortilla.\n\nBut you gotta love PB for their Classic status - like Lupie's nachos, like Dish's meatloaf, no matter how cool Burritos have become, they've made 'em this way, it's staying this way. Kind of a bummer, because I want more than just peppers and zucc in my 'rito - but kinda awesome, because beans, rice, tomatoes, cheese, various veggies, lettuce, sour cream and guac, should be enough for my Belly. Just cuz there's 6 options for meaters up there and all I get is squash, well, so be it.\n\nWhy is the rice white, why is the sky blue. These questions have no answers. So get what you can and eat it quick before it explodes all over your face\/lap\/shoes.
