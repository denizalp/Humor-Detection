This place has the most beautiful view of a city that I've ever seen. I can hang out here and enjoy  the view for hours. It's great.  My wife and I went here a couple of times when we were in Montreal, both day and night. Please do not come here in the daytime and miss coming at night. The daytime view of the city is great but the nighttime view is incredible\n\nMontreal has became one of my favorite city to visit, and this park was one of the reason. After a long day sightseeing, it is so refreshing to just end your night here and just enjoy the view. I love that this place is completely free. I love that people just enjoy the weather and drink wine from the bottle. Montreal is truly an amazing city.
