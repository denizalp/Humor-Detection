We made an appointment for a salesman to come out to give us an estimate on remodeling our pool. No show! Other pool companies have been on time, or early, to give us their bids. Apparently a \"small\" project like a remodel, although it could cost us as much as $20k, wasn't worth their time. I would recommend to STAY AWAY!
