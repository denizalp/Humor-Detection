I was in town for the UCLA game and stayed with a buddy at his place in Henderson.  He loves this place and recommended we try it.  Located in a strip mall with a few other eateries, parking was actually pretty easy on a busy Friday night.  We tried to get a patio seat since the inside can get pretty noisy but we ended up right in the middle of the dining room.  Fortunately, the acoustic gods were with us and we were not surrounded by screaming kids.  Great service from the start.  They had a ton of employees running around filling drinks and clearing plates.\n\nYou get a choice of sauces....red, pesto and garlic oil, and a ton of traditional toppings.  I had a feeling the meatball would would be killer and I was correct.  I really top quality thin crust NY pie.  Great flavor, texture and a good bite to the crust.  Ready to get your mind blown?  They use slices of cheese instead of shredded....and they put the sauce on top of the toppings...  Boom!  OK...not too revolutionary but the results were good.\n\nA very respectable dinner salad and a decent value.  Top notch for a pizza joint.
