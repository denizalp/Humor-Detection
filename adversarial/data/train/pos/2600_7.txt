I had the absolute worst experience working with Tanner. My custom tiles were broken on two different occasions - the original order and the replacement order. Over 80% of the original tiles were broken, and when I tried to get them to help me, they scoffed and pushed responsibility off on themselves and onto the distributor, me and my contractor. They said he \"needed to pull his bootstraps up\" and cut around the broken tile. Not good enough! When I just got off the phone with the owner, he was defensive, didn't apologize or take responsibility for the poor customer service follow through, and said there were six other calls he needed to take as we were trying to come to a resolution. This sucks, and I'm inclined to write to the Better Business Bureau with a complaint. If you're starting a project that needs tile, don't go with these guys. They lack all customer service skills and follow through.
