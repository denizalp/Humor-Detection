Ok so I didn't come here for the haircut, I came here just for the cotton candy latte and their latte art. \n\nIt's interesting at how they designed the space as connected next door is a hair salon so customers can wait for their appointments while drinking some latte. However, I hate to say this but I didn't like either of the lattes I ordered. Sure the drinks looked nice, but that's pretty much it. \n\n-BayMax Latte: \nIt's just a regular latte with Bay Max latte art-ish. The latte itself is OK, I have had better in downtown coffee shops. You can ask the barista to customize other latte art design if you like. \n\n-Cotton Candy Latte (pina colada flavored cotton candy)\nNot sure if I got a wrong order or maybe the menu had it wrong, this was not a latte lol. It's essentially cotton candy put on top of a cup filled with just espresso.. The cotton candy itself is store-bought. No, don't tell me that it's fresh, just don't. The cotton candy was extremely sticky and very sweet. I even saw the staff took the candy out of a plastic box that is similar to the one I saw in Metro. \n\nIt didn't taste like pina colada either. They gave us another one which was the maple syrup flavored cotton candy, and it was good but too sweet.
