Came here for the Drag Brunch on a Saturday am. \n\nLet's acknowledge the fact it's a Senor Frogs... glad we got that out of the way...\n\nWe travelled from the UK to Vegas and where super excited that the Drag brunch was hosted by Shangela and featured queens such as Coco Montrese, Yara Sofia, India Sahara and friends. The cost of this show is pretty reasonable considering you can get brunch and free mimosa's or upgrade to VIP for brunch and open bar. \n\nThe show is really funny and a perfect way to start your weekend off. Shangela is really funny and despite being a self proclaimed \"professional\" she lived up to it. The queens at today's show were on fleek and very friendly. \n\nThe crowd at the AM show filled the room where as the pm show only half filled the place. Both audiences where energetic and helped make the entire day fun. \n\nLook past the mediocre reviews on this place as a venue, if you are wanting to enjoy a Saturday am come here to the drag brunch, you won't be disappointed.
