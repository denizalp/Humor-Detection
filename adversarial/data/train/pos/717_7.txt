Aztec did a clean up for me per their description.  I have a small yard, desert landscaping so it's not something that needs to be done more than once every 6-8 weeks.  At the time they came out I had let it lapse more than I should have.  On the pro side they were the cheapest of three estimates I obtained.  In talking with the owner before they came out they were supposed to check my drip system as I was looking to add some plants or trees and wanted to make sure everything was running properly.  That did not happen.  I contacted them via email and they confirmed that they would come out next time they were in Summerlin and check them.  This was about two weeks later.  My low rating really stems from the fact that on the initial visit one of the workers smoked and left a butt in my yard.  Second, when they did come back to check the drip system the only evidence they left that they had even been there were black rubber trimmings from whatever it was they did that day. Overall, I think they are fine for basic cleanup but as far as additional maintenance, drip systems, light repair, communication in general, they were not what I was looking for.
