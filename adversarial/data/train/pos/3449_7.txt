This place is garbage.\n\n1. Every time I wanted a new beer, I had to basically perform semaphore signals with my beer glasses like I was trying to guide a landing jumbo jet.\n\n2. The fish and chips took forever to come out. I could have gone fishing, cleaned the fish, make a fire, and cook it faster than them.  Seriously, why does deep frying some food take 1 hour?\n\n3.  The fish and chips had 2 pieces, I ate the first piece, then when I went to tackle the 2nd piece, there was a super long hair coiled underneath the piece like a snake waiting to strike.  Shocked, I sent it back.\n\n4. They charged 10 bucks a head to see the UFC fight and over packed the place causing everyone to be shoulder to shoulder and the root of the shitty overall service.
