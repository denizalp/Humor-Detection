I wanted to surprise my girlfriend for our 3 year anniversary and take her out to eat at a really nice restaurant. I spent days trying to figure out when I finally decided on here. Man oh man did I choose correctly. \n\nI made reservations through open table, which was really efficient. \n\nWe get here at like 9:30 so the sun is completely down. We get to the lobby, they do bag checks for the ladies and make you go through a metal detector before you can get on the elevator to go up to the restaurant. \n\nThe restaurant is on floor 107 and you can feel how fast the elevator is flying to get there. \n\nWe get seated in no time and all I can say is WOW for the view. It was so awesome.  \n\nIt's a perfect date restaurant, dim lighting, awesome view. Although, the music threw me off as it was upbeat. You would think it would be more romantic type music. For how romantic the restaurant is. \n\nThe restaurant takes an 1 hr and 30 min to spin all the way around to get a full 360 view of the strip.\n\nYou may get a little dizzy looking out the window but if your date is going well you shouldn't be looking out the window that much!! Lol\n\nThe service was great, they quickly took our drinks and food orders. \n\nI ordered the \"Wagyu Skirt Steak\" 12oz\nGirlfriend ordered \" Filet Mignon\" 9oz\nAnd we got a side of mashed potatoes we knew the steaks alone wouldn't fill us up\n\nMy Wagyu steak was just amazing. Cooked perfectly medium rare. Left me wanting more! \n\nMy girlfriend never had filet Mignon before so she was just blown away at the texture and flavor. \n\nThe mashed potatoes, for just being mashed potatoes. Tasted amazing too! \n\nThe bill came out to 126$ but to celebrate our three years this was the perfect place to go.\n\nTaking her here definitely earned me some brownie points! Lol so fellas if you got a big date coming up , anniversary , proposal, just a date. This is the perfect place!
