Service Service Service from the first step in the door not a fancy place but pizza with a good taste and a good crust! Wings Had that crunchy skin YUMM . This place has a great team of folks that's what makes this place as good as it is. So its on a paper plate if you dine in... Do not judge a pizza by its plate!\n            They deliver they even have a take and bake ! They could be a common pizza joint but they are NOT! Do not take my word for it try it!!!!
