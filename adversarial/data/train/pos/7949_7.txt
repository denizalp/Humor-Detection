I ended up renting a car to drive from Las Vegas, NV to Orange County, CA simply because I didn't feel like paying $200+ to fly one way. This was my first time renting thru Alamo, and it was a pretty pleasant experience all around. I had made a reservation online a few weeks in advance and saw that it would only cost me $22 to rent a car for 24 hours if I paid upfront and it appeared that there wouldn't be any crazy additional charges if I were to return the car to a different location than where I had picked it up. AWESOME.\n\nThere is a nice shuttle service at the Las Vegas airport location to get from the terminal to all the car rental companies. No issues picking up the car from there as there were several agents to handle the line of people waiting to pick up their cars making the process pretty quick. For when I returned the car at the John Wayne airport location, it was just as painless. A simple pull up to the return line and a quick check of the full tank, milage, and no damage to the car and you're good to go. This Alamo location is located just across the way from the baggage claim\/terminal. Very easy to get to after getting off the plane and picking up your luggage if you checked any.\n\nMinus one star as my only complaint was the car cleanliness. Who ever was responsible for washing the car when I picked it up from the Las Vegas airport location did a crap job. Windows were pretty dirty both from the inside and out. Luckily I was traveling through the day time, so no issues seeing out. Driving at night time though was definitely a bit difficult to see out and I ended up stopping by a gas station to clean the windows myself. Also, the window wipers didn't have any fluid in them so thank goodness I wasn't in dire need to wipe it down when driving during the day.\n\nAnyways, thanks for the overall painless rental Alamo. \n\n'Til next time, cheers!
