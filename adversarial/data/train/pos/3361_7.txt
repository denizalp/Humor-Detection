Goddamm. The food here is bitchin.\n\nIt's right next to a strip club, but don't prejudge it to be a tacky Mexican place. It's very family friendly inside. Parking is pretty easy. The place is also very well furnished and themed. \n\nCustomer service here has always been on point too. Came in here at 5:50 but unfortunately we didn't get helped out until 6:05. I know we were kind of pushing it but we were trying to hit up happy hour before it ended at 6. Fortunately our server Neil was able to hook it up and give us the happy our deal!\n\nI seem to notice the wait time for food seems to be a bit long but it's definitely worth it. Get the al pastor and cochinita taco's definitely well cooked.\n\nP.S. NEIL IS DA MAN I HOPE YOU READ THIS.
