Don't ever get another donut anywhere else.\n\nPrices = REASONABLE\nQuality = FANTASTIC\nInterior = 70's VINTAGE (Love it, very casual and nothing fancy)\nOwners = GREAT\n\nTheir basic cake donuts with sprinkles are by far one of the best things I have ever placed into my big mouth. \n\nJust remember to bring cash. Last time I went, I got there near closing and had to scrounge up $4 from crevices in my car to get my donuts. Totally worth the work but if you come prepared with cash, no awkward car scrounging is required.\n\nGET THE CAKE DONUT WITH SPRINKLES NOW!!!!!!!!
