The website allows you to book a reservation yet it does not allow you to confirm the price upon checkout.  Omni, it is not best practice to ask for your clients credit card information without informing them of the quote\/price they are agreeing to upon the \"Confirm\" page.  Please change.  Also, when I tried to call in to make a reservation I was greeting with a \"PLEASE HOLD\" in what sounded like one of Marge Simpson's sister's voice.  My call was then picked up, transferred and finally dropped.  This is why you did not get my business today.  I sincerely hope this feedback helps you improve your business.
