I decided to return to Three Amigos last Thursday for a second chance dine in experience. Shout out to the owner, Dalton, for attempting to rectify my last take out experience. The server was attentive and friendly, she brought us our chips, salsa, and queso pretty quickly. The chips were good but the salsa and queso were far from acceptable. I have never eaten such watery salsa and queso in my life, no bueno!!! The server was unable to switch the watery salsa out for a chunky version. \n\nWe came in specifically for the endless enchilada special for $8.99, not a bad deal. We had a choice of chicken or beef with red or green sauce. The enchiladas did take a while to come out but we didn't mind, had plenty of time to kill before our Star Wars showing at 11p. I loved the red enchilada sauce, very flavorful! The chicken inside was not seasoned however, it was juicy. This carried over into the chicken empanada which was free with Yelp check in, not an item I would order on my own. I didn't like the green enchilada sauce as much. I was struggling to finish my second plate. 4\/5 for the red enchiladas. The other star was docked for the salsa and queso. \n\nAll in all, thanks to Three Amigos and Dalton for bringing me in for a sit down dinner. I will be back for enchilada Thursdays and will only be ordering the red sauce. I will also be bringing my own salsa for my next Three Amigos outing, I'm not a risk taker.
