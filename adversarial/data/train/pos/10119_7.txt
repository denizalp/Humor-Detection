On my first visit to this theatre I thought it was going to be love at first sight as I really liked the old look of the theatre and they actually have some pinball machines in the arcade room.  Unfortunately this place is very poorly run.  Recently I did a double feature for my birthday and purchased both tickets up front but apparently no one else shares my ethics as they don't check for tickets on either side of the cinemaplex and people are constantly jumping movies.  Every movie I've seen there has had tons of kids coming in halfway and shouting things along the lines of \"we've got 15 minutes so why the fuck not.\"  There are apparently no ushers and I've sat down next to left over drinks and other garbage from previous screenings several times.  Perhaps I'm a snob but certain types of people gravitate to this cinema so I'd prefer to spend my money at Sundance where I can actually hear my movie undisturbed, sit in clean comfy seats and actually have someone help me at the concession stand rather than see 8 teens bumble around talking while only one person works the register.  I only go here when Sundance isn't playing the movie I want to see and thankfully that is not very often.
