A small office is tucked away off of Sunset on Whitney Ranch.  I was having a bit of some pain on my foot which has been troubling me for a while.  I wasn't sure what to expect when the doctor examined it.  \n\nDr. Fatkin was very friendly and professional.  I felt really comfortable with his process.  There was not any pressure to take various medications or have unnecessary procedures done.  I truly appreciate that.  \n\nLike I said before, the office is small but it's clean as a doctors office should be. I appreciate them keeping the appointments on time and efficient.  \n\nThanks for the helpful suggestions that are already helping my foot pain less and less each day.
