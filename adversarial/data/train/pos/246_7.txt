It's been a while since I've eaten at Red Lobster and boy has it really fallen off.  The place was dirty.  I'm talking nobody coming by once to pick up the dropped food on the floor even after the party left.  I ordered the Ultimate Feast.  I love lobster tail; I never thought I'd see the day when I'd spit it out.  The shrimp was salty and pretty sad...I guess the bigger, more succelent ones got laid off.   I know times are hard, but damn!  I walked away with an upset stomach.  I had a gift card, but the food and service wasn't even worth the gas I used driving there.  I contributed to global warming for that s***?
