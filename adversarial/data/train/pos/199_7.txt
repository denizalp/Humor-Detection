Yes, this place is chaotic, messy and a bit scary sometimes, but if you're a cheap bitch like me, the juice is worth the squeeze! \n\nConsider this, Nordstrom takes back any item at any time without a receipt. All those returns across the country make their way to Last Chance for your shopping pleasure. There are some serious bargains to be had, and I could list off all my favorite finds over the last few years. However, I'll just give you some of my favorite tips.\n\n1. Know what you want ahead of time to make shopping less overwhelming. I always have a few ideas in mind to focus my efforts.\n\n2. Bring a friend who knows your tastes and size. Many items are misplaced so it's good to have another person to cover more ground. \n\n3. Allow a couple hours for some serious shopping. All that scouring takes time, and then you have to deal with the dressing room line. At least they got rid of the open areas so you can preserve some modesty.\n\n4. Know your designers and pricing so you can decide if your item if really a worthwhile bargain. Ideally, you should be paying 10-20% of retail.\n\n5. Inspect carefully! I've found some weird holes and sketchy stains after the fact because I got too rushed.\n\nHappy hunting!
