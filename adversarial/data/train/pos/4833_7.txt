We worked with these ladies at one of our venues in downtown Phoenix and man did they rock!!  They treated the bride with such respect and care. She was incredibly relaxed  during the entire planning process, which is the enter point of a good planner.  Laurie actually had a mini medical emergency during the set up of the event and kept on trucking through the entire event. Only going to the ER the following day.  They really did a wonderful job and were a real pleasure to work with!  I would recommend them any day.
