Not 24\/7.. Most Planet Fitness gyms are.. But not Fort Mill and Rock Hill. They close at 7 pm Saturdays and Sundays. And 9 on Fridays!...Even though I was told by their associate when I transferred my black card membership from Charlotte that eventually Fort Mill would be 24\/7. Nearly a year later they seem to be doing great on memberships and still only 24\/4.. Forget working out Friday, Saturday or Sunday nights.
