I can honestly say I had a blast at Palmer Street. At the tail end of a boy's night out with John H., I was like \"Dude, let's go to Abari and play some video games!\" And John was like, \"Dude - I know an even better place, Palmer Street!\n\nHe was right! This has more of a neighborhood bar feel than a kind of closed in \"cave like\" private club. This is the kind of place that you want to go to after a long day at work, have a beer and let off some steam.\n\nThere's lots of little winks and nods to gamers and gaming hidden in plain sight in the d√©cor. \n\nThe beers are mostly local and are on the higher end of the price spectrum - but who cares because all the games (except pinball) are free. We sat our beers on those cool pallet stands and after about thirty minutes of frenetic clicking and clacking, we kicked Shredder's a$$!! Turtle Power! Nerds Rule and so does NPR and IPA!\n\nDefinitely check this place out before it gets too crowded!!!
