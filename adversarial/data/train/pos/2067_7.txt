Paid for termite service and over the 2 years, company has come out 3 times... the Termidor and foam does not appear to be effective.  Basically the termites have kept moving all around the house and reappearing elsewhere, rather than the termites ingesting the poison and supposedly kill the base colonies.  Of course there's alot of potential reasons they are suggesting such as maybe I'm dealing w\/ multiple colonies (a NEW colony appears in another part of the house consistantly?  doubt it), new landscaping (no), or new builds (no, well established neighborhood of 10+ years).\n\nThe 2 year warranty is up of last week, and of course, there is a new termite tunnel now in another room of the house.  I would pay for the $99 renewal to extend service if I had faith in the product or services.  But now I'm especially concerned w\/ the customer service, as I received alot of pushback from the office manager to speak with an \"inspector\" before they physically come out.  She was extremely argumentative and talking over me, insisting an inspector cannot speak to me via phone as they unable to \"treat\" over the phone.  Understanding that, I had to keep repeating I would like to discuss if there are new techniques, methods or chemicals as obviously the past 3 treatments were ineffective.  While she kept talking over me (at one point, I asked her to let me finish talking) and obviously would not listen (I finally was driven to talk over her), I simply kept restating the request for the \"inspector\" to call first so I can address concerns and set expectations.  That went on for a long time, seriously, is it that hard to ask for a phone call first?\n\nMaybe for any reason termites are happily munching on my drywall to this day that is beyond this company's control (doesn't that make you feel confident?), but it's the extreme lack of customer service and care that has driven this to a 1-star review.
