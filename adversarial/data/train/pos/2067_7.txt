Do not trust anyone else in the city with one of the most important tools in your kitchen. \nYour knives.\n\nI have sent my knives here twice and each time I have had fabulous customer service, quality \"repair\" and fast turnaround. \n\nI take my Wusthof, Global and even my cheapy Top Chef (Master Cutlery) brand knives here. \n\nThe service is the same all around the cheapies or not!
