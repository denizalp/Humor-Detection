Tried to phone order twice was put on hold for over 25 minutes. I called again asked for the restraint manager, got a voice mail. I called back and asked for the casino manager, she Raquel is very pleasant and sweet, very professional on her job.\nAnyways, I ordered the Prime Rib dinner and it was very good. but The restraint staff is very very lazy immature, rude,terrible with customer service yes you Michael,you need to watch who you talk to. especially your elders I wished your momma saw you, cause if you were my son,I'd slap you!!!!  Also have been there for there Chicken Fried Steak, YUMMY!!! There food is very very good for the price, Good Luck
