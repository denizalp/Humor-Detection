I took my nephew here for his birthday and had a great experience. Sat in the bar area and the service was great even though it was the last hour they were open and the girl was trying to get closing stuff done. The food was tasty and timely and that visit would've gotten a 5star review.\n\nHowever...I got a take out order tonight because my daughter wanted steak and I was in the area already, so I decided to come back since the food was great.  I made sure that we had the amount of containers as food ordered but I did not think to open each container to make sure everything was in it.  I finally make it home and get to my entree and notice that something was missing. The classic dinners are supposed to come with saut√©ed mushrooms and mine were not there. I called the restaurant to tell them, granted they are closed, and spoke to Carlos.  He did apologize but said there was nothing they could do because they are closed and it must have just been an oversight.  So nice knowing that just because you order and pay for something doesn't mean that you'll actually get all that is supposed to be there. Knowing that this happened and they don't care makes me not want to go back to any Keg restaurant.  This experience became a 1 star very fast...so both combined get just 3.  There are lots of other places that actually care that their guests get what they ordered.
