There is always a line out the door whenever I come here and for good reason!\n\nI always try their rotating, seasonal flavors and absolutely fell in love with the ones they have now. I eyed the flavor Stout and was shocked that I had to sample it instantly- they do ask if you are of drinking age however. The Stout flavor is of Guiness with Malted Chocolate, talk about adult indulgence! I then saw underneath the flavor, The Hangover (Helper) which the lovely gal offered just as I finished eyeing it. This my friends is a total win! It's a whiskey-vanilla based ice cream with corn flakes, very similar to Humphry Slocombe's Secret Breakfast in San Francisco. Whiskey and corn flakes it's a genius flavor in itself- talk about corny!\n\nThe staff here is always wonderful and their flavors are great! Definitely one of my fave ice cream spots of all time.
