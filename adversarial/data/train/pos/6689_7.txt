I was curious to see what the hype was so I lined up for 2 hours about 1 week after opening. The lineup stretched to the door of the coach terminal. I estimated it would take about an hour but my estimates were overly conservative. The line hardly moved because the store can only make 10 cakes at a time and it takes 10 minutes per batch.\n\nWhen we were there, there was only one flavour of cheesecake that was available (cheesecake flavour). It was $10 with tax, cash only, and limit 1 per person.\n\nAfter we got the cakes, my friend and I finished it very quickly. The cake was very spongy, smooth, warm. I ate some of it the next day when it was cold and it was still so yummy. The cakes have a 3 day expiration.\n\n3\/5 stars because of the huge wait. Was it worth it? Definitely not worth the time in line. \n\nWhen I was in line, someone had actually bought a cheesecake and sold it to someone in the end of the line for double the price.
