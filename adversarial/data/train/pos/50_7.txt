the chicken paprikash was excellent for a chicken dish.  Egg noodles are also called dumplings at this place, and i think in most backwards part of hungary.  Normally dumplings are always big filled with things.  even Perogie dumplings from ukrain are  dumplings.  Spietze is more precise and its called egg noodles - not dumplings.  Even edelwiess village at the german deli calli t egg noodles.   But I had to have an arguments.   I would say that Shnitzel really is not Hungarian - but german.\n\nI guess if you enjoy bland home cooked regular food then you will enjoy this.  I could never understand - having disliked cabbage rolls and rouladin and vereniken etc from a small child having them all the time.  I would go to friends houses who had chicken wings everyday and hotdogs and think how lucky they were.  They would come to my house and have meatloaf and say it was the best thing theyve ever eaten in their lives.  I guess its all in the perspective
