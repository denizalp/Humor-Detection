Convenient spot from Alexis Park Resort to walk over and get a decent breakfast. I had an eggs and sausage with home fries and wheat toast and my friend had the egg and spinach scramble. The food was good (especially the potatoes--they were like tater tots!) and service was nice but the menu was kind of limited. I enjoyed watching all the old 80s music videos on the wall monitors and was pleasantly surprised to discover their 20% off Yelp check in deal (food and non-alcoholic beverages only)!
