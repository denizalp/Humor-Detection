I gave them until Xmas.  They closed sooner!  Why my review was different from all the enthusiastic asshole Yelpers was I went when they weren't expecting a party.  \n\nI emailed Double Elle asking them what the shelf life is for their baked goods.  A helluva lot less time than Old Barn is selling them for. And they were stale. Twice.\n\nThis place is so poor and pathetic.  Those who are too young to remember \"fern bars\" will think it's \"so cool and groovy and it has BARE BRICKS!\"\n\nOh yes, I forgot to write \"kewel\".  (pass me the barf bucket, please)
