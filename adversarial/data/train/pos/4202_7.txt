This Target is a bullseye!\n\nI have always had a positive experience across the 50+ times I have been here!\n\nParking is easy, perusing the aisles with complimentary Wi-Fi is a nice touch, and the checkout aisles are ran very efficiently. David appears to be one of the shift supervisors, and always displays a high level of professionalism and expertise. Well done!
