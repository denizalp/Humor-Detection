The mall is okay, and I have to tell you, every retail space is occupied, and that's a good thing these days. However, indoor malls are somewhat dated, in my opinion. Stall air, poor lighting, and confined claustrophobic surroundings cause me never to linger too long.\n\nI have a particular store (think stones) that keeps me coming back, and yesterday I circumnavigated the place and found it quite entertaining, particularly for people watching...a kid friendly place, with lots of places to spend your money to keep your spoiled brat happy, because that's what it seemed like parents, and grandparents alike, were doing in order to maintain decorum whilst they continue to indulge in consumerism, but hey, it's Christmas time and we gotta buy useless stuff for that cousin we see once a year that will end up in the back of closets after a year if they don't end up in the garbage, right!?\n\nSorry, I guess the urinals had me a bit peeved...ONE GALLON PER FLUSH!? Come on join the 21st Century! I wanted to snap a pic for ya'll but I couldn't come up with a sane reason to explain what I was doing, if caught...eh, I'm doing research? (maybe next time). I'll be back, because I like shopping, no matter how lame it can be.
