I hesitate slightly to write this review, because I'm not sure I want anyone else finding out about this place...it already can be hard enough to get a table.  \n\nThe BEER: I would say that Barhop has assembled probably the best craft beer list of any restaurant in Toronto.  There are some close contenders, but they're way ahead of Beer Bistro now.  Their prices are reasonable and much cheaper than say Bar Volo.  It's a nice mix of Canadian (including brewpubs like Bellwoods), American standouts (like Bear Republic), some Quebec breweries, and a few European options.  They also have an extensive, although much pricier, bottle list.\n\nThe FOOD:  I kind of just want to write a review of \"THE BURGER\".  They do an amazing burger...my mouth is watering just thinking about it.  It's house-ground meat cooked to a delicious medium\/medium-well slathered in a bone-marrow aioli...before you say gross, try it.  It's amazing.  My only complaint is that there is some day-to-day variation.  Namely it ranges from fairly good to the best burger I've had in my life.  It's served with delicious onion rings (breaded with Rice Krispies) on top.\n\nThe rest of their food is pretty decent, although I tend to stick to the burger or their specials.\n\nThe SERVICE:  Table service is generally pretty good.  Most of the servers know their beer (and have tasted what's on tap), and are not shy about making recommendations. They're also friendly.  I find one of the bartenders at the bar to be sadly rather rude and standoffish...that's my only negative about this place.\n\nThe SPECIALS:\n-Sunday: $5 session beers...pretty good if you drink on a Sunday.\n-Monday: $10 for 2 pounds of mussels and frites.  Don't order one per person...2 pounds is a lot more than you think.  They're good!\n-Tuesday: Buck-a-shuck oysters. If you like oysters, these are good and as cheap as they come.  This is an effective promotion, because it gets busy Tuesdays!  \n\nOk, now don't tell anyone who's not a super-cool person about Barhop, because I want to keep it for me.
