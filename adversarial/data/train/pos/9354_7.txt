Holy sweet potato empanada! \n\nSo, I finally went to try The Summit Room out and I ended up back there three days later because i just HAD to have more sweet potato empanadas. (Get them, I swear, you'll be happy). \n\nI like the vibe of this place, nice but not stuffy, good crowd, nice wait staff. It wouldn't break my heart if it was a little bigger, I went on a Saturday at first and it feels pretty packed pretty quickly. \n\nNow, food. In my two visits I feel like I've already had a good amount of food from here. Clearly I love the empanadas. The mussels were fantastic, the broth was so delicious, right amount, tasty garlic bread - officially in the running for my favorite mussels in town. The Pork Belly\/Shrimp Sliders - very very good, fun flavors, a little small. I get the slider thing but the second time we ordered them, I felt like all I was eating was bread and I was a bit disappointed. They are fantastic though and a must try. We also tried the Summit burger, it was good, simple, a very good amount of burger, tasty - If I wanted a burger, I wouldn't hesitate to eat theirs. We also had the brussels sprouts - these were delicious. A little maple and buttery and I ate them all in just a few bites. Great side dish to a meal. Finally we had the Uno Alla Volta Burrata - yes, please, get it! It was so fresh and so fantastic - I only wished there was more. If you like mozzarella, you have to try this dish, it melts right on the plate and in your mouth. Only thing with the cheese is that I wish it came with bread, so much so that I was really surprised and confused that it didn't and asked our waitress for some. \n\nAll in all, I have really enjoyed my food at Summit Room so far and I look forward to trying a few more plates. The only thing that's keeping me from 5 stars is that I do think it's a bit overpriced. I feel like these plates could easily all start $5-8 lower. Either way, I will be back for my empanadas.
