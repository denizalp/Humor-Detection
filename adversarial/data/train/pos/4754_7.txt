Had to try this place. The previous business at this location was horrendous. The new business seems to be just fine.\nVery clean, staff seems to be on their game. Food was good. Yes, it's another sports bar. Seems that's all we have is Surprise. Pretzels were good, and their cheeseburger were excellent. Nothing to complain about.
