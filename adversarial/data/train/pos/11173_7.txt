Okay I may be a tad biased, for as long as I have be living here in Arizona- 16 years- this has been a fantastic treat for my family and I. (Granted I have only been legal for a few months) Always having a casual close spot has been a haven for everything from quick meals to special events (just had a fabulous birthday dinner there) with fantastic fried food and a friendly wait staff. WARNING: if you want to have a healthy meal, this might not be the place to go. I mean the healthiest option is the salad carbon but you can never resist their amazing chips and salsa which will always leaving you bloated (as well as very satisfied) as you walk out the door.\n\nWhen you walk into the restaurant you are greeted by the cute kitchy decor that always puts me in the mood for a fabulous meal. I mean who \nhates cute little cowboy hat light fixtures and cow hide seating: people with no souls, that's who. I mean it always makes me smile when I see the old western movie posters and the charm that you don't find in restaurants anymore- cute without the overly chainy feel.\n\nThis place for lunch is fast, you can be in and out of this place in a half and hour! That's what I call service! If you want my recommendation, order the pollo con queso, its just some nice little chicken burros, covered in melted cheese and for the grand finale globed with spicy cream cheese. I mean what's better than that, nothing.  \n\nMaybe it's the ooey gooey comfort food covered in cheese, artery clogging guacamole goodness that I need once in a while. Maybe its the sweet, regular staff that always greets me and seems to know what I order. Or maybe its the fact that my recent diagnosis of gluten intolerance has not impeded my meal here at all- I can still feel evil eating delicious food without actually getting sick... um WIN?! Whatever it is, no matter what anyone says this place will always have a special place in my heart and will never lose it's spot as the best mexican food in town.
