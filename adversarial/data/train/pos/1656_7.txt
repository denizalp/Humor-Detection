My \"go to\" place to grab a bite to eat when I'm in the C-Gates area of McCarran Int'l Airport.  I like to grab a Burrito & a Brewskie while I wait for my plane to depart.  Since I'm one of those guys who likes to get to the airport super early so I don't miss my flight, I have plenty of time to kill.  The FREE WiFi is awesome because I can surf the web while I enjoy my eats from this place.\n\nReturn Factor - 80%
