Oh my.  This place is mildly awful.\n\nIs it the dirty carpets, the fact that we had to wait 10 minutes for a tablecloth for our foldable card table, or the grains of old rice lumps stuck to all the dishware? \n\nMy brother says it's the cold, bitter, dirty-water tasting tea that killed the experience for him.  For me, it was the fact that our tea had a whole bunch of chrysanthemum flower petals inside and stuck to the outsides of the teapot.  \n\nWhat's the problem in that, you may ask? Well, it \nwas a teapot that was supposed to be just hot water.  Also...we had jasmine tea. So where the heck did the petals come from?  I have creeping heebie-jeebies feels that says they very likely don't wash their teapots at all between guests. Ick. \n\nOh, and the food was just as bad.  If you would like to know what their food tastes like, just go to your closest local Chinese grocery store, buy some frozen dim sum, microwave it...because that's exactly what it's like.  Except for the price point, because at Gold Mark you're going to fork over a not-too-low $4.99-$6.99 per dim sum dish.  Blech.
