I came here on my friend's recommendation. I'm not a big curry fan, but \nperhaps the curry is amazing like she said. \n\nFirst off, when we walked in, the owner and waiter were talking to each other. My boyfriend and I weren't sure if we should wait to be seated or just walk to any table. After standing for a few minutes, the waiter told us to have a seat anywhere without leaving behind the counter. We sat down, and the two continued their conversation. I had to look back 4 - 5 times before the waiter came and brought us menus. When we decided what to order, he didn't come back until I looked back another 4 - 5 times. By the way, there was only one other table occupied that was deciding what they wanted for dessert. I can't say anything bad about the waiter because he was overall nice, but not attentive at all. We never got water refills.\n\nI always order Pad Thai, and wasn't wowed by it here. First, they charge for adding tofu. I got a chicken and tofu mix - and although I paid for tofu, there wasn't much tofu added. I always get mild flavored Pad Thai, and I feel that really allows you to taste the food. If there's still a lot of flavor without the spiciness, then you know the natural dish is well made and not masked by the spices. The portion was alright - but not enough peanuts nor bean sprouts. The dish itself was way too sweet for my taste.\n\nMy boyfriend ordered the sizzling beef dish. I was able to finish my entire dish before his entree came out. The waiter didn't tell us that it was going to take that long. It came on a clay dish and sizzled a lot, but for the price, it wasn't worth it at all. The beef was pretty typical. It tasted kind of like black pepper chicken at Panda Express - but beef instead of chicken. FYI: my Pad Thai came out after a very long time as well. \n\nFrom walking in to walking out, I think it took us an entire hour for this meal. Don't go here if you're in a rush, and don't order the Pad Thai nor Sizzling Beef Dish.
