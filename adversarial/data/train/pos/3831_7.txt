Good menu and great sports watching for the business casual crowd. \n\nI'd been to their other location around Central & Greenway, so I knew what I was in for. \n\nThere's great sports watching from every seat in the house, which was essential for Monday Night Football. The sound is perfect as well--loud enough to yell at the screen without looking like too much of a weirdo. \n\nThe food is good as well. Wings are stellar, and on Tues\/Thurs you can score killer deals! The pizza and burgers are just OK, but you really can't go wrong with these. Just make sure your tongue is trained if you wanna try the nuclear variety. ;-) \n\nDrinks are inexpensive while still packing a punch. The Tropical Breeze, with coconut vodka, rum, and some juice was hella groovy. And best of all...service rocked. Every single server was helpful! I would return for happy hour on a weekday any time.
