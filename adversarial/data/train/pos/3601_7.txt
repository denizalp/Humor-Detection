If it has Pikachu or Hello Kitty on it, you'll probably find it here. There's more to this spot than that though (and green tea Kit Kats)-  this spot is decently sized but packed with Japanese import products from condiments and beverages to painted plates and chopstick sets. And that's just in the first aisle!\n\nPredictably, a lot of their stock has some relation to anime series or characters, such as beach towels, shirts, action figures, and car decals, but HK by far has the biggest dedicated section. If you know a fan with a birthday coming up, you're sure to find them something they don't have. Can I suggest car license plate screw covers with her likeness? Easily one of the more obscure things I found.\n\nGreat little spot to browse around, whether or not you think you'll buy anything. Because you don't really need a reason to buy soft green-tea-flavored Oreos or erasers that look like sushi. The world needs more cuteness. Start here.
