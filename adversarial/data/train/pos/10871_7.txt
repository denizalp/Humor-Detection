I'm giving this place the two stars for the employees who have been fantastic and have made my drink to order just the way I like it. SEVERAL of them have been wonderful, and I have had nothing but a great experience ordering my drink from them. \n      I'm giving this place a bad review because of the experience I had tonight. I won't even go into detail because it's really not necessary. All you have to do is look at how many bad reviews there are for this place. Most of which are for the same reasons. What I will say is this, never tell a customer, especially an excellent customer who comes to your establishment several times a week, to just go someplace else. This is what I was told by who I believe is the owner. This is absolutely unacceptable. If this is what you think customer is supposed to be, I strongly recommend a training course on customer service. \n      My recommendation for anyone thinking of buying anything from Desert Eagle is, there are dozens of coffee places in the valley that clearly appreciate there customers considerably more than this place does. So please, do yourselves a favor and buy from them. \n     One last thing to the people at Desert Eagle, if they read this, if you have to repeatedly apologize for bad service, bad attitudes and a bad product, you're doing it wrong. There's a reason why DB has huge lines day and night, and you have no lines at all.
