On those days you just want a diner (Low Key and Good Food) I was pleasantly surprised when my sister and I spent our lunch hour at Golden Griddle : on Laird.  First time there: Tues, where they had an all you can eat \"pancake\" buffet + ($10)... ( Yummy if your in a pancake mood, plus it was Mardi Gras Fat Tuesday so we wanted to go somewhere to bring a bit of New Orleans to us in T.O. :)  ) \nNot only was the food good and the place very cozy ... the service was crazy outstanding... where the manager not only came to ask if everything was ok ... but the staff was very friendly and made it feel like we were dining in a small town ... which is rare when you live in a big city. Sweet! :)
