A lifesaver for conscientious urban noisemakers like me.\n\nSo, I play the bagpipes. They're freaking loud, and 90% of the time, really annoying. I openly admit that pretty much the only time they're not annoying is when played skillfully, in good tuning, in an open space to allow for lovely acoustical resonances. \n\nThis is not the reality of me practicing my bagpipes. Sometimes I need to work on the same figure that I keep messing up...over, and over, and over again. Sometimes I need a half hour of making honking noises to figure out why things aren't playing right. \n\nAnd I like my neighbors. I want them to keep liking me.\n\nThis is where Studio Bizz comes in. They rent out sound-isolated rooms of various sizes for musicians, dancers, and other creative types. They're open really broad hours, and the rates are very reasonable (off-peak rates for one person in their smallest room is $10\/hour). The staff is bilingual and extremely friendly. The space is clean and well cared for, and there's a rotating art gallery display. They sell snacks, too, although I've never lingered long enough to buy refreshments, although the lounge space is cozy.\n\nLady O.'s review might be referencing a class she took here, as there's a rotation of dance workshops that meet at Studio Bizz, and which I'm interested in checking out. Can't speak to the quality of those classes, or the levels they offer. For now, though, I'm happy to pop my earplugs in and make loud, ugly bagpipe noises, so that I can actually make nice (read: less annoying) music when I unleash them on the greater public.
