They decided to completely redo the menu and took off all our favorite dishes...including the Fra Diavolo.\nWe came in tonight and were so disappointed that we left. I don't understand why Bravo would mess with their menu and not even offer anything close to the old favorites. There's no point in coming here anymore.\nCutting up my Bravo Rewards card.
