I love shopping at Whole Paycheck.  It is my everyday grocery store and I don't drive a Luxury car!  I will gladly pay a little more for the quality especially in the produce, seafood, butcher, and cheese department...they even get me buying boutique bottles of wine that no one else carries.  I can't tell you my wine secrets though...three times now friends of mine have bought the last case of a great bottle I found here.\n\nThis is not my favorite location however...my favorite departments are usually the butcher and produce sections of WF...with a shout -out to the wine and cheese.  This is a smaller location though and they simply don't have the space to carry as large of a variety.  That being said, They have one of the better food bars at this location!\n\nI am also a fan of the small portions of high quality cheese that they sell.  They regularly put out smaller cuts of cheese into an under $2 and under $3 basket in their cheese case.  I try so many more cheeses because of this...and they make so much more money off of me for this way because I am always buying some cheese that I would otherwise not buy...I mean how could I go through an entire normal wedge or block of cheese?
