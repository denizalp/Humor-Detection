This is my home-base Einstein's..or is it Noah's Bagels?  Same thing really.  I was delighted to learn Phoenix has Noah's sister company, Einstein Bros Bagels, upon moving here.\n\nMy favorite is the 6 cheese bagel, but I'm branching out more and more and trying other flavors.\n\nMinus one star for running out of my beloved 6 cheese from time to time and I sitll have a hard time paying $5 for a bagel, cream cheese (I refuse to use that awful 'S' word they use), and juice.
