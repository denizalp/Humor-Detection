505 is by far the worst apartments. Cops are always called in the wee hours of any night of the week. Their \"Security Gaurd\" Is no where to be found ever! Residants have constant drug deals going in and out of there mailboxes constantly. Drunken fights are also a Norm. The office does nothing and cares about little. Well Collecting your money, they do well:-) They go after you like a hungry animal over any small detail and try to charge you for it. Ex: there is no drop Box for rent...So If rent is Due on a friday and if the office is closed saturday or any day thats a hoiliday, you better get your money in Friday or they will charge you for being late Sunday. there is no way no get your money to them unless you hand it to them or pay $45 online.The Office also Hires A towing Company to pick up any car that has expired tags!!! Seriously!!! The Caddy office staff do i dare even call them ladies, walk around checking residents tags, notates them then call the towing comapny.  They also Take the really old apartments they have left and rent them out, wait for you to move, then charge you up the hoo ha  to fund their renivations for the unit after you leave. \nForget about getting help with Roach infestations, it took almost 4 months for someone to help me out. After they had built their own Colony in my kitchen. Trust me when you go in, the office staff are basically the \"Sirens\" of 505. Good LUck\nI feel sorry for anyone who chooses to live here.
