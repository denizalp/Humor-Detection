This HT is the odd one of the bunch, by no fault of its own. Uptown just doesn't have all the space for the full-fledged HT experience. What it does offer is a very good selection for the fine people of Forth Ward.\n\nFull Deli, Meat\/Seafood Counter, all the produce you'd normally find, and even a Hot Bar & Pizza for lunch. These are good, fresh highlights of convenience for such a small store. The dry, non-perishable grocery section is where it starts to get a bit limited. Don't expect to find a ton of speciality items, but its still adequate for your everyday needs.\n\nParking is... Well it's something. Limited is an understatement and they share the lot with businesses in the same block. I would guess there are less than 50 spaces. Take my advice and do not park anywhere marked no-parking. Even if you're only going to be 'just a minute' you stand a good chance of getting towed. This isn't Harris Teeter's fault, the underground lot has strict fire codes and the property manager is covering his ass!\n\nGreat for stuff in a pinch, I would go to the store on East Blvd if you have the time though.
