Why I am an elitist...\n\n1.  I do not hoot and holler when my team scores a field goal in the final minutes of the 4th quarter when the score is 38-14.\n\n2.  I try to keep a low profile when hot wing sauce has stained my shirt.  I'd probably clean it off first, but hey, maybe you're saving it for later.\n\n3.  Ridiculing other patrons because their team is losing isn't cool.\n\n4.  Your fuckin' Gator chomp is lame.\n\n5.  This is a bar\/restaurant, not Collegetown Bar packed to the brim with meatheads and Miller Lites.\n\nI would have said something, but you were busy making love to your 3rd grilled chicken sandwich, fatty.
