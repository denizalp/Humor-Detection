I'm rejuvenated and relaxed I use to frequent this salon two years ago and then moved from this end of town. I'm in North Las Vegas now and it seems all the salons are non English speaking.\n\nI took a leap of faith and went back to this salon. What a great decision I made. I requested a male nail technician due to the fact that it had been awhile since my feet had been properly pedicured. And the ladies seem to take it easy on me.\n\nI was greeted by the salon receptionist and was offered a beverage my pedi bowl was drawn and I was promptly seated for my Royal pedicure. My technician was the very polite Bruce. He took his time and applied all the courses of the spa pedi and basically refurbished my feet. I complemented him on his patients to service my feet and thanked him for not rushing his response was. I enjoy cleaning and working on feet. We discussed further maintenance on my feet and the importance of me coming back twice a month. He made me feel so comfortable and my feet were soft as a baby's ass when he finished. He then walked me over to the manicure table and gave me an equally comforting mani. I now have a manicurist that will service me going forward. Bruce is a professional the facility is spotless and the cliental is upscale. None of that getto booty bumping music. A first class experience . Ill be back!!!!! And I strongly recommend this salon to any male that mans capes !!!!!!!!!!
