You either love it, or you feel, just \"eh\" about The Halal Guys. It's not like it's hit or miss, because it's pretty much the same, every time. There are minimal options, and you most likely know what you are going to order before you arrive. I personally love the combo platter, which is grilled chicken, beef, lettuce, tomatoes, rice, and pita bread. I add two white sauce packets and one hot sauce packet. YES, the hot sauce IS HOT. BUT, if you like spicy, and you mix it all together, it compliments the meat and white sauce perfectly and leaves just the right amount of linger on your tongue. I love it! You can also order falafel if you don't do meat. Or a Gyro sandwich on fresh pita. \nThe location is a decent size with about 4 tables. But it's really meant to be just like NY, grab and go. See a long line, don't stress, it moves SO FAST!  \nI had The Halal Guys off a truck in NY, and to me, it taste the exact same! I have read some reviews about it being different but I did not notice. This place has been open less than a month and I have already been here 4 times! My kid likes it, my boyfriend likes it, and even when I brought my best friend a plate, she killed it. \nSure, it's basic. But to me, it hits the spot every time. Good, fresh food, nice people, good prices. The crack sauce, I mean white sauce that is so DAM addicting. If you haven't stepped out of your pizza and burger comfort zone lately, take a leap and do it here!
