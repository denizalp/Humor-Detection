Cheap, endless condiments, sitting on wooden crates, smelling like open flame cooked burgers after you leave, the old burlap sacks lining the ceiling, the televisions...\n\nThis is a dude establishment. But it's delicious, so it's ok! They even have veggie burgers, but you might be made fun of for ordering one when you could get the huge burger with grilled peppers and bacon on it. Manly!\n\nReal men pay in cash or they don't get food at all.
