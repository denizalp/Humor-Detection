Great gyro wrap for under $5!  Fresh, fast, and healthy!\n\nHowever,  if you're going past 10PM at night, make sure you have your cell phone with you so you can call them.  (It was a late night snack for us...)\n\nWe walked around for 20 minutes in downtown Pittsburgh (I know, we were brave), and up the block, down the block, we couldn't find this place!  We decided to go back to our hotel at Station Square. \nIn a brilliant moment, I then pulled out my Yelp app on my phone and looked up their number.\n\nOur conversation went a little like this,\nMe: \"Um, yeah, are you open right now?\"\nGuy: \"Yes.\"\nMe: \"Um, how do I get in?\"\nGuy: \"There isn't a guy down there?\"\nMe: \"No.\"\nGuy: \"Guy with a T-shirt?\"\nMe\" \"No.\"\nGuy: \"Are you down there right now?\"\nMe: \"Um, yes...\" (not really, I was a block away)\nGuy: \"Ok, he's going to come down now and let you in.\"\nMe.....hauling tail to get back to catch the guy in T-shirt\n\n\nWeird, I know, but thought I'd save you the \"scary\" stroll in downtown Pittsburgh looking lost.  Trust me, you don't want to get lost down there.\n\nIt is a really cool place. Tourists or students alike, TRY IT OUT!\n\nThey're open late!
