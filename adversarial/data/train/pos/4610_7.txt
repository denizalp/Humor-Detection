Let's say you're a guy who's trying to acclimate to spicy food and you get asked to pick from a spicy scale of 1 to 10. Obviously you need to aim for the lower end of the scale, but you don't want to do 1 since that's not going to help your cause at all. You could ask for a 2, but that just seems like you're being too cautious. So you call for a 3.\n\nAfter today, I'm going to avoid making that mistake again. That spiciness on my $9.45 curry with pork katsu + $0.50 corn definitely slowed me down compared to my companions. It didn't help that I initially assumed that the high temperature was the same thing as the high heat, so I kinda got a double whammy. However, I've gotta say that the curry was really hearty, the protein portion was balanced with the rice (brown, per my choosing), and the pickled radish provided in a little container at the table kicked some serious booty. The curry may have been a touch on the salty side, but I don't mind that too much.\n\nThe restaurant itself is in a small space, but we didn't have problems getting seated at about 15 minutes after opening. I also appreciate that they have nice jazz music to help you relax as you're dripping sweat, as well as sufficient water refill checks. This certainly is worth a trip no matter where you are in the valley if you get a craving for curry, and it's serendipitous that it's right next to a great dessert spot so that you can cool down afterward and really get into that state of zen. Or at least that's what I ended up having to do.
