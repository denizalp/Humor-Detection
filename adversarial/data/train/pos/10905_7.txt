If you're interested in just throwing your money away, stay here. Otherwise, pay a little extra, go on the Hotel Tonight app and hit up the Venetian or the Wynn.\n\nThe good news about this \"hotel\" is that the front desk staff are super friendly. They really make you feel welcome. That's just the staff that are checking people in, but not really the management - which if you do end up staying here, you'll most likely need to complain to one of the managers.\n\nThe bad news is something I could spend days talking about, but for the sake of brevity, I'll summarize.\n\nThey put me in room 1385, which has a 2 ft stain on the carpet, so I asked to be moved. They moved me to 1637 (which was an ordeal, but again, the front desk staff are super friendly). The problems I had with 1637 are really too many to count. Nasty bathrooms, nasty tub, broken lamp, non-draining and nasty tub, outdated everything are just a few to name.\n\nA really nice surprise was a blood stain on the carpet next to the bed. Very appealing.\n\nI complained to the manager in the morning who was pretty nonchalant about the whole thing and told me that it was just wear and tear. Nice. He told me that I should have just stayed at the Wynn (because it literally was about $20 more that night on Hotel Tonight). I asked him if I could quote him on yelp and he just threatened that if I quoted him with his name, they will take legal action. So, I won't say his name, but I'll just tell you that he had a gnarly frohawk. He was probably sick and tired of hearing how bad their rooms are and stuff like that.\n\nI snapped a few pics (thank you iphone) so you can get an idea of what to expect.
