This is one of the better Farmer's Markets I've experienced in PHX... or anywhere actually. There are obviously a bunch of local products, as I'm sure has been discussed in other reviews. \n\nI don't know if anyone has mentioned it, but they have quail eggs. I think that's pretty cool. They're little. And speckled. They catch my eye Every Time. Fun to look at, but expensive. I haven't made the purchase splurge yet, but I will. Some day.\n\nWe come to the Saturday Market pretty regularly in the cooler months. Now that we've moved even closer, this will more than likely be an every weekend occurrence.  \n\nMy only issue with PPM is that it can get crowded which is frustrating for me because I generally don't like people near me or touching me. Not that there's too much touching going on, but people do get near me... like way too close near me. I need my bubble of personal space. Just a 3 feet radius. Arms length. That's all I'm asking for. \n\nThe parking can also be a pain, but that's typical for downtown.\n\nOverall, it's great! You can support local farmers, artisans... and you can look at quail eggs... or buy them if you're a baller like that.
