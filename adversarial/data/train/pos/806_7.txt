This very friendly, well organized preschool is in such demand that I see it has parents lined up at at registration time every year!  Wee Blessings Preschool has a solid curriculum, friendly educators, a clean building, and is run very efficiently.  With a variety of field trips and extra curricular activities offered,  this academy provides students a complete and well balanced preschool.   I love this academy!!
