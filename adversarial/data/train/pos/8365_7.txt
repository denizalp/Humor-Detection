You walk into this joint and its old school like paisa style tiendita, piled hight with nicknacks to the ceiling. Horder style hard core. Love it! There is something for everyone. Of course the Buddha want's the biggest chocolate milk he can find the the coolers and a bag of chocolate coins... Seasonal. \n\nOh and just in case you are wondering this spotty is Frenchie... its La Grande Orange not La Naranja Grande okay! \n\nBreakfast here is pretty damn delish! I love eggs cooked properly and served with a hearty side of meat. LGO brought it! The english muffin that came with was so soft and delicious! Probably the best english muffin I've ever had. Note to self: grab a bag to bring home next time I'm here...\n\nFrench pancakes, wow, just yum. Soft and sweet and covered in fresh strawberries. I was an instant fan. \n\nThere are a ton of treats and sweets on the menu I am killin to try. There's one sandwich i want to grub on too. Everyone raves. \n\nThey whip up a mean latte too...  \n\nSaid this in my other review also, but.... If you do not like crowds or tight spots this is not the place for you. You order your food on the grocery side and there are always a ton of people in this itty bitty space. The menus are near the register when they should be near the doors. But there is usually a kind staff member to ask if you need one. \n\nDefinitely a fan of LGO Grocery.
