Well  I don't know what Kind of sex they've been having, but I've never had sex that Bad!\n\nHonestly the worst Carrot Cake I've Ever had!\n\nServed in a big thick square, no layers, no filling, it had the consistency of wet packed sand that was thinly covered with a flavorless white frost and sprinkled with toffee chips and topped with a soggy strawberry.UGH!\n\nI'm so glad I didn't have lunch there, and now I never will.\n\nIt was also just a weird vibe walking in there, it's located in the same shabby courtyard as the country cottage, but had no class.\n\nTo the right as I walked in was a dimly lit area that looked like a ceremonial orgy room with a shrine to the God awful cake...WTF...\n\nThere was about 4 or 5 dark haired wannabe Italian guys running around acting like waiters.........is that supposed to be a turn on to get you ready for the non-climactic cake........I think only Pasta Brioni can pull that one off but barely.\n\nSo I took 2 bites and threw it in the trash, said thanks for nothing and called my husband to tell him he had NOTHING to worry about!!\n\nFYI...if your sex is so bad that your are resorting to that cake.....GOD HELP YOU!
