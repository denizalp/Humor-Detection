Figured I should update my review since its been a year. Rolled in Sunday morning around 1030am and the parking lot was pretty full. My normal table was taken so I sat at the bar.\n\nThey had a 6 oz ribeye steak and egg special for $6.99 so I ordered that plus an ice tea. Service was actually pretty quick considering the crowd, and within 15 minutes I had a nice plate of food in front of me. The steak was ordered medium rare and it came medium rare and tasted great. Eggs, toast, and hash browns later I was full and happy.\n\nService here is always good, friendly people behind the bar and Marian is such a sweetheart. I've eaten here so many times and only once have I not been a fan of my meal.
