In my previous review I said I was too cool to shop here, but I lied!  Muhahaha!  So I've been here a handful of times now and just recently ran into an employee who thinks he's so cool that even HE shouldn't be there.\n\n\nThere was one lady ahead of me at the check out.  The young man running the register said hello to her and asked her how she was doing.  She responded politely and the transaction was done as he said thank you and goodbye to her.  I step up to the plate and homeboy doesn't even look in my direction.  I'm not expecting them to roll out the red carpet and hand me glasses of bubbly, but you can at least utter the word \"hey\" in my general direction.  \n\nHe scans and bags my items and uses all his life force to barely mutter \"29.75.\"  So I slide my good ol' plastic and his register spits out a receipt.  To which he grabs said receipt, stuffs it in my bag, and thrusts the bag in my face. \n\nAfter that he just stared over the top of my head off into the distance and never spoke again.  I was pretty surprised.  Not a hello, goodbye, or even the often required \"have a nice day\" in a monotone voice.   \n\nIt's logical to assume that there are, at least, two sides to every story.  I don't know what his story was exactly, but I'm going to guess that he was offended because I probably looked like his mama.  His mama always says \"why do you have those dime sized holes in your earlobes honey?\"  AND \"why must you wear your pants around your knees?\"  \n\nOMG mom is annoying AND soooo embarrassing!\n\nThe customer service here isn't usually that bad by a long shot, but whenever I do go I ALWAYS avoid that kid.  I don't wanna perpetuate his mommy complex.  Oh no you didn't!!!
