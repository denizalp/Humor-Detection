The only reason I'm giving a star is because while we were there the food smelled good. We walk in and it is packed, it's Sunday so I get it \n\nThere was no one greeting and directing ppl so you're just standing there looking like a fool for a min. I finally walked up to the counter and asked if we had to reserve a seat if we wanted to eat it there, we were told there were no reservations and you just had to wait for a table to open up. \n\nSo as we're waiting for a table to open up, the ppl behind us get up to leave. So as we turn to take a seat, another older couple just slip right in smirking and saying that they were waiting for a table when they were already sitting at one! The restaurant workers saw the whole thing and didn't do a thing about it. AWESOME customer service... not. Needless to say, we ordered our food to go and after waiting for a good amount of time I hear the guys say in tagalog that he never got our ticket order. That was the last straw, we just walked out. We'll wait around for some improvements, if any.
