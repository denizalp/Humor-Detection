I drove around the busy shopping center and having seen the sign before...I knew I was in the right place.  Nestled in the southwest corner and after fighting 4:00PM traffic, when located, I smiled.  Not an Uncle Lee's mega store by any stretch, it still provided the distilled goodness I was seeking after traveling many miles to get it.  Given it's intimately small surroundings this particular location is bursting at the seams with bottles and friendly service.
