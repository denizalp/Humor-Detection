I ate here a few days ago with my husband and it was good but I think it reminds me too much of a regular American breakfast that I can get anywhere.\n\nThe restaurant is very clean, staff are very nice and the owner is working with his staff and not bossing them around- nice change nowadays!\n\nMy husband got the pancakes, a cinnamon roll, a side of bacon and I got a half size of biscuits and gravy. No doubt their food is homemade and delicious but I feel like it is nothing too spectacular. Their pancakes are delicious and has a homey smell to it and their biscuits are nice and fluffy. Their gravy is homemade as well and you get little chunks of sausage and bacon in it.\n\nIf you do get a snack, beware of the cinnamon roll! It is extremely filling and delicious! We shared one and it was pretty large and I was so full after! \n\nAll in all, I'm sure we would come back as my husband loves American dining and I would just try something different.
