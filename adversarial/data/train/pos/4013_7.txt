props !! this is the ice cream shop you wish you had around the corner. the people here are enthusiastic about their flavors ~ they were so patient and offered all the samples. we got boba milk tea and cookie monster. cookie monster had cookie dough AND oreos in it so everybody wins. i would try their waffles next time because they sandwich the ice cream in between bwahaaaa
