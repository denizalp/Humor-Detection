As regulars we usually go Tuesday nights on the Patio for live music.  Last night was terrible. In all my years in Vegas I have never heard a band as bad as last night. They sang outta tune, outta key. We're extremely loud and basically just sucked. Our server was either from Italy or Latino. My wife said Brazil???   she couldn't understand English. We asked what wines they poured after repeating the question a few times she thought about it and said we have Red and White.  Really!!!\nI asked for crushed red chili flakes for my flat bread and she didn't have a clue.  I asked for a Gin and Tonic and got Gin and Soda.   I guess it was a night we all should of stayed home.
