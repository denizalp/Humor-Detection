I've eaten from Commisso's a bunch of times, and based on the day, my star rating would vary, but tonight was one of those 'off' nights.\n\nIt gets points and the patented Dave-thumbs-up for being open 24\/7, but I'm just not impressed by the food itself. It could perhaps be in part due to the late hours in which I frequent the place, but it's rare when my order tastes fresh. \n\nOccasionally the sandwiches are perfect. Sadly, most days the bread is rock-hard, the meats taste as though they've been sitting around for a while, and the pizza\/panzo's are way too greasy. Having a little grease with your pizza deliciousness is one thing. Having more grease inside your panzo than cheese is quite another, which was the unfortunate hellzoratti I had tonight. TMI, but I'm pretty sure if I pee sometime soon, it's coming out orange. Happy halloween! \n\nThe only way they've ever been consistent for me is with their pasta, which I would happily recommend. And to be fair, there are still many things there that I have yet to try, and their prices are always great.\n\nNote: This is the first review I've done that not only described the food in question, but any and all after-effects from eating it. I'm officially past the point of no return. Pray for me. Oh and recommend me a more consistent late-night italian joint.
