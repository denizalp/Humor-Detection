Culver's is just darn good!!! Their employees are super stars!! Their burgers are fantastic, way better than Five Guys!!! \n\nTheir fried chicken is DELICIOUS!!! It comes with your choice of sides, but standard is mashed potatoes and gravy and FRESH cooked cut green beans and a roll!! LOVE IT!!! It is home style cooking, for sure! Choose white or dark meat, 2 piece meal, for ONLY $5.99!! Bye bye KFC! This place plucks your feathers and spits them at you!!\n\nTheir custard is so tasty, of course!! I like the turtle sundae the very best!!!
