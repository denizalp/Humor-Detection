**********WARNING***********WARNING*********WARNING********WARNING********CRIMINALS!!! The service guy's name is Paul.  He has a strong Brooklyn accent and tried to explain to me the 5 things why my garage door would not function within the next 6 weeks.  He wanted to charge me 1,000 dollars for a new door and opener.  He came up with this figure off the top of his head.  This is after he told me he knew the type of person I was and he could talk to me \"man to man\".  I guess he thought I was an idiot then.  I called another company and they fixed my problem for under 200 dollars.  Apparently there are a few realtors running around and putting these stickers on the inside of the garage of the selected house. They get paid 60 dollars per sticker. It was on the news, please do your research and do not use this company!!!!
