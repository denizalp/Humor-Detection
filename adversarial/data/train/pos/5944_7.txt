Such a dark, mysterious, cool cocktail lounge in downtown Las Vegas!  I had a little help getting in the front door since two ladies were standing outside and opened it for me, but could be a little tricky.  I found a seat at the bar and the bartender made me one of the best cocktails I have enjoyed in a long time...the Make Fetch Happen with vodka, strawberry, lemon and dill - dangerously delicious and so well made.  Definitely worth a visit for some amazingly tasty cocktails!
