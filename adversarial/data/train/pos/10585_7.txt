You know when you have that gut feeling that you should just chose another place to eat but you ignore it, in this case I wish I had listened. The initial transformation to an 80's cabaret was oddly the least disturbing part of this restaurant. Upon entering we were asked to sign in and \"donate\" 10 dollars each for the band. In all my dining experience have I ever been asked to pay for the entertainment and the donation was not optional as we were instructed we had to pay before being seated. Ignoring the urge to leave then, we were seated where the waitress explained a few dishes. We never received any bread that is pictured in all of the reviews, the mussels appetizer consisted of 5 total, and cheese appetizer though not bad, was pretty salty. Our entrees did not make up for the poor start. A poor rendition of chucascaria style meat, overly sweet curry shrimp, and completely undressed salads left much to be desired. The mysterious disappearance of our waitress while we anxiously waited for the check to leave immediately was the last nail in the coffin. We will not return and regretfully had to go to a second restaurant that night to remove the bad taste and bad feelings we were left with following this dining experience.
