There is absolutely no reason to go to any other hookah lounge in Vegas. I honestly wish the hookah lounges were like this in Scottsdale. You walk in and immediately feel the Mediterranean ambiance... the decor is unreal. The hookahs last more than two hours and you get a box of samples to choose from. The drinks are strong. The food is SO good. We can't wait to go back.
