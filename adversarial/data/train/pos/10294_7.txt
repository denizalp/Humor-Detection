Went to try the lunch special today and was doing a \"Happy Dance\" in my chair. \nI got the yellow curry with chicken # 3 with the spice level 7. And the curry was spicy and sweet at the same time. I loved it.  The egg roll was veggie ( just ok for me) but my Jazzy liked it.   I would defiantly go back for MORE...  Can't go wrong for $6.95 for lunch and its actually filling and Good !!!!
