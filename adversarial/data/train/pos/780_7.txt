There is something to be said about numbering some of their choice menu items and not labeling them with some fancy name -  just letting the ingredients speak for themselves.\n\nGoing to Kalendar for brunch was a lovely alternative to my usual taste for greasy spoon diner brunches. Sure they have your typical eggs with sausage, homefries and toast option, but the highlights center around their creative omelette flavour combinations that think outside the \"Western Omelette\" box that you'll likely not see anywhere else. You'll also want to take a gander at their specials board that go above and beyond for brunch.\n\nAnd while Kalendars became synonymous with brunch for me, I had the pleasure of going for dinner there once and ordering scroll #6: roast beef, portobello mushroom, caramelized onion, asiago cheese and plum tomatoes with horseradish mayonnaise - seriously, no words... just hard, passionate emotions.\n\nShhh... not yet...\n\nIt's no surprise you'll be subjected to a 10-15 minute when you get there but man alive, is it worth it! Friendly staff and delicious food is really all we foodie folk ask for. This place has you covered!
