VIB, Very Important Baby \nMy brother and his girlfriend recently had their baby shower. They signed up for the baby shower registry and customer service talked them into the VIB card. It was explained that anyone could come in and add money to the VIB card and that they would be able to use it to purchase any item in the store. The liked the idea of only having one (1) gift card that anyone could add money, making it easier when they went shopping.\nHowever, when they went in to use the card they were informed that they could only use it for diapers, wipes or formula. This is pretty ridiculous considering the diapers, wipes and formula are much more expensive at Babies R Us and normally they would purchase those things at other places. I'm specifically upset because I put money on the card, specifically so that they could buy a certain item from the store that I knew they wanted. However, now they are forced to use that money towards overpriced diapers or wipes. Any money that is put on a gift card VIB or otherwise should be allowed to spend the same as cash. I feel it's outrageous to force them to purchase certain items. Going forward I will be shopping elsewhere for any and all baby items.\n\nI've added an extra star, because after much complaining they decided to move the money over to a regular gift card that they are able to use to purchase any store item.  Much better!!
