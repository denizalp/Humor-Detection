My and my husband our 5 kids , mom and mother in law  went to this place . We spent over $60 on dinner buying meals , salads , drinks , and a couple of sides , hummus etc... My husband asked if we can have a side of sauce the \"  tzatziki \" beacuse his  chicken wrap was kinda dry , the Girl said Sure that will be 50 cents ...\n\n\n50 cents what!!! after spending $60 she was chargeing us for a 2 cent sauce , wow so cheap and the food was  dry ....
