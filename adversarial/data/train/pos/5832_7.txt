strict adherence to a well defined set of ethical yelping guidelines is all that is keeping me from giving randy's 5 stars. the truth is that i love randy's and hope it stays open for one thousand years. which it might. \n\nrandy's is a diner for the geriatric crowd north of old town in scottsdale, arizona. it features a lot of muted pastels, physical copies of newspapers, and really weak coffee. the wait staff is a hodgepodge of goofballs and misfits, most of whom i adore. \n\ni can only comment on breakfast. 5 cups of randy's coffee translates to roughly one cup of....normal coffee. the best meal i've had here is the big daddy's hash with two over medium eggs on top of it. that meal is very good. the pancakes are good - please add bananas if you care about yourself \/ your short experience on earth. the bacon is OK but if you ask them to make it extra crispy they will definitely do it. the grits are OK. the country potatoes are good. the hash browns are good. the fruit bowls are OK. the pie is very good. \n\nbasically randy's is immensely predictable, and often totally hits the spot for me. it hurts me to think about mentioning the downsides of randy's because i don't want to, but here they are:\n\nthe menu is too big\nwhy is it called randy's ice cream? it's a diner\nthe coffee is bbbbbaaaaaaaaaaddddddd \nfood is hit or miss - you've gotta know what to order\nthe water is gross\ncash only and the ATM fee is $3.50 or something similarly criminal\nbirds will eat your food if you sit outside\n\noverall this is unquestionably an A-OK establishment that has a little bit of weird charm and a lot of convenience that keeps me coming back. don't bring a date here. don't bring a snobby relative here. do bring a good friend or your down to earth college professors here.  \n\ni feel a little bad in my heart saying that it's 3 stars because i'm here 3x a month and everyone here is lovely. but, like i said, ethics.\n\nmuch love and see you soon.\n\nrobinson
