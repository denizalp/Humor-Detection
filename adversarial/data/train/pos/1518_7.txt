I've read many raving reviews about this place but found it to be less than good myself.  It kinda tasted like frozen pizza dough(its not) and my cheese was barely meted.  I prefer my pizza to be nice and bubbly on top.  I give it two stars because the owner was super nice and gave us extra toppings for free.
