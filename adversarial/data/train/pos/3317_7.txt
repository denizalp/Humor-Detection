Don't waste your time or money. This school is not worth what they charge and I'm highly disappointed in the education they provide. They are even looking for new instructors on Craigslist. Trust me, it has been my biggest regret making the decision to attend this school, don't make it yours. I could go on with a list of reasons why not to attend this school but I rather keep it short and sweet. If you want a medical career you can do it without Pima who you can NOT TRUST because they DO NOT RESPECT YOU and who the hell would prefer this school over the other options you have out there.
