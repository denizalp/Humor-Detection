Le Peep's food, and in particular the skillets, specifically the upgraded Hobo known  as the Drifter (~$8), with two basted eggs, cheese, vegetables, potatoes, with a choice of English muffin, is as good as I remember from 10 years ago in the Paramus, NJ location. This is to say in no uncertain terms that it is superior to the similar offering at the self-proclaimed benevolent indigenous chain that uses egg as its namesake.\n\nIt appears however that being outnumbered and alone in Scottsdale against aforementioned indigenous chain has caused Le Peep to age before its time. Very few patrons on a Monday morning, quite brisk in the restaurant (especially by the standards of the natives, for whom 80 is cold), signs of wear in the building and an entirely unfinished floor. It's possible that this location is in the midst of renovations (although doesn't explain the dearth of customers) but it looks like they just let themselves go.\n\nLe Peep, as a friend, I will tell you the situation is reversed. Even if you have better food, if you want to compete, you need to be better than the competition with name-brand recognition, not just a lackluster shadow of your former self clinging to beauty long since claimed by time. Even though I'll miss the Drifter, if you've given up, please pack up and put yourself out of your misery before dishonoring the memories of better times.
