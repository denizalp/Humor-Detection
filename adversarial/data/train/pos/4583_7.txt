Probably my worst experience with a clinic. Mind you, I grew up in the third world. I received better care there? No way? I'm currently a patient here & already, I've regretted my decision to choose this clinic.\n\nMy second time to visit to the clinic, the receptionist with a facial piercing, Danielle \"T.\" (she wouldn't give her last name), who impatiently shouted her name at me when I misheard & mumbled some complaint immediately after, told me & hubby the news that we're to completely pay off our medical bill in about 6 weeks. Surprise!\n\nMy friends tell me they took years to completely pay off theirs. So we asked Danielle \"T.\" if they offer payment plans. She left the room, talked to someone, came back & informed us that the most they could do was give us a few more weeks to pay off our few thousand dollars in medical bills.\n\nThe following day, we called the clinic & found out they have a financial advisor. But since Danielle the badass receptionist didn't bother telling us & had us sign the document, we were then required to pay the delivery fee asap. My bad, but I didn't feel like we were really being given a choice.\n\nWhen we met with the financial advisor, she was ambiguous & had a condescending tone, like she was talking to 1st graders with an IQ of 25.  There was no private room for discussing financial matters, & anyone passing by could easily get in on anyone else's business.\n\nMy midwife seemed rushed, dismissive, & impatient, like her next patient was maybe FLOTUS. My other doctor, bless her because she was superrr nice, didn't give me a general idea of a good blood sugar range for me, someone with gestational diabetes. I had to Google this, & I don't trust Dr. Google too well. The ultrasound lady was somewhat robotic & didn't introduce herself. She was nice, but had possibly done ultrasounds so many times that she's a little dead inside & can no longer feign excitement for any couple finding out their baby's gender for the first time.\n\nI don't know if this clinic is better or worse than the Women's Resource Center, where the receptionist asked me if the guy with me was my husband OR \"some guy off the street\". Wow. Because people actually pick a random guy off the street to go with them when they do their very 1st ultrasound ever.\n\nWSC is a clinic that I would recommend to neither friends nor foes. While I haven't had to deal with the notorious wait time, which is a blessing, the service is simply not worth it. Read the reviews below & decide for yourself. I'm currently trying to find out if it's an option to switch providers. With the exception of the 1 kind girl in the small room where they draw blood (the other 1 was annoyed that I wasn't shedding enough blood, like that was my fault), I simply don't like the staff or service at WSC, or how they do things.\n\nThey are not very nice here. A lot of the staff members are, pardon the term, quite b***hy; it might be best to change their initials from WSC to PMS. It's 1 of those places that leave you feeling rather mistreated, & you find yourself wanting to go back & go Pretty Woman on them: \"BIG mistake. HUGE.\"\n\nWellHealth \"Quality Care\" really isn't very accurate. It seems the care that they offer & the way they treat patients is simply, sorry to say, substandard.\n\nUpdate: we've found another clinic in Summerlin. Naturally, it's better than WSC. When we called WSC to let them know we were getting my records, someone on the phone said it will take them 5-7 days to process everything. Five to seven days. We went there to submit a signed consent form on the same day & BOOM, someone was able to give us a complete copy of my records in 5-7 minutes.
