$5 TUESDAYS!\nI'm a sucker for a great deal haha.. Anyways Tuesdays are usually the only days I will watch a movie here. Reason being that they are always really busy and I hate sitting in a packed theater. I will say that the theater is relatively new so everything is still pretty nice and in good shape. And of course what other movie theater can you drink in?.. only in Vegas haha \nHowever..I do NOT like the whole pre selecting your seats thing. I'm sure some people like it but I like the freedom of walking into a theater and sitting where I want or moving to another seat if someone sits right by me LOL and we actually almost got in to a fight with some people because of this.. \nAlso one time I saw a movie goer throw a drink at a worker ... So I think because of the location (town square) and since they serve alcohol here there are a bunch of rowdy semi intoxicated people.. no bueno. \n \nRandom.. but i don't like their bright orange restrooms.. LOL is it just me?
