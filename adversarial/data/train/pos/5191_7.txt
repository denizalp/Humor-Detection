I bought a FabFind coupon the other day, and was super excited to get my '$30 worth of candy for $15'.\n\nGranted, the coupon was only for the bulk selection, but that's my favourite stuff ... Anyways, I was really disappointed with Suckers.\n\nI started off at the gummies. \nI tried using the provided scoops, but quite honestly, everything was freakin' as hard as a rock! I couldn't scoop anything, because they'd all congealed together, and the stale (sad) state they were in made it impossible. \n\nThe bins they were in, looked like they'd have better days. Dusty, squeaky, and wouldn't stay up. \n\nMoved on to the  bulk sour section.\nSame as above. HARD AS A ROCK. \nI ended up using my hands, to grab stuff, as I realized I had $30 to spend in here, as so far, had an empty bag in my hand. :(\n \nLiquorish section. \nSee above. \n\nChocolate bulk selection was barely there.\nSome chocolate covered almonds, and such. \n\nThey have a much larger selection of bulk candy at The Bulk Barn. And that stuff is fresh. This stuff was nasty. :(\n\nThey had a massive selection of pre-packaged candy, but quite honestly, I'd be curious to know the turn over rate of that stuff. They have so much 'stuff', and based on the sad state of the bulk product, I'd never buy anything in there. Chances are it's been sitting in here for a loooong time. \n\nThis place gets a pass from a Candy Lover. \nBoo.
