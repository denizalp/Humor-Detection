I messed up on an Amazon order and needed to send the mistake back.  I opted for the UPS Drop Location.  I did not know exactly where a location was and so I googled one and locate this UPS store.\n\nBasically, all the work was done on my end.  I printed out what I was supposed to and headed off to the googled location.\n\nI needed an envelope large enough to accommodate my mistake.  It was easy to find and relatively inexpensive.\n\nThere were a few other customers ahead of me, but the line moved quick enough.\n\nThe service was A-OK.  The transaction was A-OK.  I reckon, if I ever find myself in this sort of predicament again and I am in the area, I would visit this particular location again.
