Finally got back into hiking...I hope that is.  Las Vegas is more than just casinos, night life, strip clubs, and hotels.  Las Vegas also has Red Rock Canyon, which I regret not taking the advantage of more.  \n\nWe decided on hiking the Grand Staircase off Calico Basin.  We weren't  looking for a very difficult or strenuous hike.  But weren't also in search of a cupcake either.  Elnino F led a handful of us, which included Terri R, Ian A, Yessenia, Gemma, and myself.  The hike starts off rather simple, but gets tougher the higher you go up, it did for me at least.  From bottom to the top, it took us 36 minutes flat.  Keep in mind, that we were in no rush, we took our time, we wanted to be safe, and of course, made several pit stops to photo shoot.  The hike down is a different story.  This took us about 10 minutes longer. We even got side tracked because all the trails and rocks started to look the same.  I'm writing this review which means we made it down safe. My advice...be safe, respect Mother Nature, and come out to enjoy what else Vegas has to offer.\n\nJust a Note:\n-The hike up is like walking up Mother Nature's staircase. Hah!\n-Be prepared to scramble up and down the Grand Staircase.\n-Gorgeous views from the top\n-Pack enough hydration regardless of the weather. I even packed some BCAA's and protein in order to get my meals in.\n-Sunscreen is a must\n-Wear comfortable clothing and shoes. \n-Off...you will need some bug repellent to warn off those pesty mosquitos.\n-A moderate hike like the Grand Staircase sure beats the treadmill and stairmaster any day. Great cardio!\n\n\nPS: Elnino and I have been planning a hike for the last 8 months.  Better late than never, my friend. More hikes to come. That's for sure.\n\n\n\n\nYELP PERSONAL CHALLENGE 2013 - (418\/500)
