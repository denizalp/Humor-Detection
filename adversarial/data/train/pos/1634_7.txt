3 1\/2 stars. Another new burger experience at Smashburger. I arrived b4 noon and there was a line 10 deep. I went with the bacon cheese burger regular smash and tried the smash fries which are rosemary garlic flavored with olive oil. \n\nI must say the burger meat was quality with little to no fat and was thick unlike In & Out. The apple wood smoked bacon was yummy and overall exceptional. The fries were thin cut and also a nice change from just boring fries. \n\nCon is the price isn't cheap and it's a fast food joint. Although I would return again and I'm looking forward to trying a Haagan Dazs shake!
