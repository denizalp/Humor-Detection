I ate at Movenpick in 1994 declared it my favorite meal of our trip to Toronto. I didn't return to Toronto until last year when I discovered Movenpick's had closed, but this year I found out when I visited that Rich Tree had some connection to the old Movenpick rosti brand. (What Movenpick was known for was rosti - essentially a Swiss potato pancake.) Either they bought them out or were just copying. Either way I was game.\n\nUnlike Movenpick, which was a sit down restaurant, Rich Tree (this location anyway) is a buy-it-at-the-counter-and-take-it-elsewhere-to-eat-in-the-mall sort of place. They had a good selection of fresh and healthy-looking meal options (also some not so healthy-looking meal options). There were several different stations - pasta and hot entrees, soups, salads, and a big dessert counter. I got the cooked to order plain rosti ($3.98). They also had other versions with barbeque chicken and with sausage. They charged an extra 50 cents for sour cream, which was slightly bullshitty. (It's a potato pancake. You've gotta eat it with sour cream or apple sauce.)\n\nIt was a big portion but didn't seem like quite enough for lunch so I also got a cup of the lentil soup. I was told that the container I had chosen was a small but when I went to pay I found out it was a medium ($1.50 higher). I couldn't resist the peach juice ($2.50) so I got that as well. My seemingly cheap lunch, after tax, suddenly became $13.\n\nThe rosti looked and tasted more like hash browns than latkes. They were fine, but really, nothing special. The lentil soup was really, really bland. The peach juice was fine but again, nothing really special.\n\nAnd so falls another great food memory when I've revisited it 15 years later.
