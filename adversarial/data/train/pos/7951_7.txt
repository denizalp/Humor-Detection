I was in Phoenix and wanted to see a movie, and the timing worked out at this particular theater so I made the trek. This place was difficult to find and Waze even got confused but eventually I spotted the bright neon AMC sign in the distance. \n\nIt was unclear where to park or if I'd get validation from the theater. I noticed a couple of cars going into an adjacent garage, so I gave it a go. The gate wouldn't let me in. You had to have some sort of keycard to park in there. Okay, whatever. I'm still not sure if the theater has a dedicated parking lot or garage! I ended up circling for parking on the busy street on a Friday night. Not fun. The parking was metered too, so I had the added stress of not only scouring the car for coins but also worrying about the clock. Minus 2 stars for the parking hassle because a business, especially a movie theater, needs to make it easy to park. \n\nAfter a short walk to the entrance, I bought my ticket. The theater was in a state of disrepair, with carpet ripped up and obvious construction and serious renovations going on. I won't hold this against them because I'm glad AMC is trying to upgrade its theaters. \n\nI climbed the steep flight of stairs (escalators were shut down) to a theater on the top floor. I wasn't expecting much but the auditorium was nice! It was outfitted with comfy (if well worn) red leatherette recliner seats and a screen that was small but wide (the auditorium was small so the screen was appropriately sized). The sound was good and the temperature was perfect. No complaints. \n\nI'd probably not return to this theater but it's well appointed inside. I'd suggest taking an Uber if you don't want to fool with parking.
