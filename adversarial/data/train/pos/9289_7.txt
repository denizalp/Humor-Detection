Less than 6 months ago we visited this Fleming in Chandler and we were very disappointed. While the food was good the place was noisy and it seemed the clientele was not what Flemings is known for.\n\nOne would not expect to go to a Flemings and spend $200 on a dinner to listen to screaming kids. The family was out of place and not properly dressed for this type  of restaurant.  I would have gotten up and left but we were too far into the process. \n\nLast nite we went to the Flemings in Scottsdale and was pleased with the experience. The Scottsdale Flemings was the high end experience they are known for. \n\nWhile we wont return to the Chandler location one would need to decide if they want to spend that kind of money when they can go to Texas Roadhouse or Logan's for decent food costing a lot less and expect to hear kids screaming. \n\nMgmt needs to decide if they want to be a Flemings or a RedRobin and advertise as such.
