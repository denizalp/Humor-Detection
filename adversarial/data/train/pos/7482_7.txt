I had breakfast and dinner here on the same day.  I am all torn up inside about this restaurant.  Well, it's not that dramatic but I do think food quality ranges from nearly excellent to meh.  \n\nBreakfast is served here from 6:30-noon.  Coffee was pretty good and so was that complimentary smoothie thing.  Steak and eggs were awesome for $21.  The steak was so good and tender I thought I should come back for dinner...and I did. \n\nFor dinner I ordered the 17 ounce bone in ribeye medium rare.  The edges were flavorful and tender but as I got closer to the bone it was chewy like too much gristle.  Only the edges were good the rest was yucks.  Also the dinner steak is finished in some demi-glaze sauce that does nothing but ruin the texture.  Just finish it with clarified butter I say!\n\nMy dinner cost three times as much as my breakfast but it was unfortunately NOT 3 times as good.  \n\nOne thing that is consistent is the good attentive service.  The staff is really nice and thoughtful.  So I guess I'll stick to breakfast the next time I'm here.
