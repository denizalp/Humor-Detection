Does a one star restaurant deserve a full review?\n\nWell, I should at least explain why it receives a single star from me.  How about dirty plates?  Very dirty plates.\n\nOn the coffee mug, a faded pink lipstick mark.  On my breakfast plate, dried egg yolk from the previous customer.\n\nYuk.  Clean up your act.. and your plates.
