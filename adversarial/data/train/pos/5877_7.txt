So, I've been here 4 or 5 times so far and YAY! I'm a fan!\nGreat happy hour. The drinks are great....love it. They have a moscow mule that is so damn delicious! They have a bunch of other drinks that are tasty too, but I always get the mule; it works!\nThe food is delicious. My fav......the bangers and mash. HO LEE COW. It's so good. I am very particular with sausage. I want to describe how I am, but it will sound so sexual (insert penis jokes) so all I will say is, there's is very good. \nThe watermelon feta salad is absolutely delicious. I get it every time. The clay pot was so outstanding, Coudn't believe how good it was. Highly recommend. \nNatalia is a bartender\/waitress and she is just amazing. So friendly, so helpful! \nIt's a great place to chill with good friends, eat some delicious food and have some great drinks.
