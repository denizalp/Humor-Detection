It's a slow work day so why not review the place that i just had for lunch? :)\n\nBobby & i have probably had lunch at every place possible downtown. We wanted something different. He brought up \"the place near the eye ball park\" and i knew he meant Proper Brick Oven since we have been meaning to try it out. \n\nWe had about 30 minutes of my lunch left and i wasn't sure if it would leave us enough time, but it worked out great. We ordered drinks and then ordered our meal as they were delivered. We went with the Pesto which is described on the menu as: 'oven-roasted Roma tomato, caramelized onion, basil pesto, house-cured bacon, house mozzarella, grated Pecorino-Romano & garlic oil'. Honestly, it was one of the best pizzas i have tasted. I'm not a \"pizza person\" & don't go searching for the city's #1, but i was very satisfied with this one. Every topping was very flavorful and tasty. Oh, another plus- the pizza came out in aboutt (or less than) than 10 minutes. Also, Bobby gave two thumbs up on his long island & the list of beer on tap was amazing!\n\nService was great as well as the ambiance. As tasty as the pizza was, i wish the toppings were spread out a little more evenly. Some slices were full of bacon while others didnt seem to have 2 pieces & other slices didnt seem to have any of those delicious tomatoes. Again this isn't a huge deal for how tasty the pizza was, it just would have just been better to experience the whole pizza on every slice.
