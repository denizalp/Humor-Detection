This review is for their moving quote only.\nGiven the stellar reviews, I think they should be given some balance. \nI, too, noticed this company comes up at the top of Google and Yelp lists for movers. Great. I enlisted three at the top to give me quotes based on same info I gave via email. Prime Moving Company was nearly twice the quote of the one I chose, GE Logistic Solutions, one I was very pleased with.\nI have several issues here. One, an office worker, one who was not going to be moving me, was doing the quote. Two, she was using a form regardless of exact info I already provided. It included questions and answers that did not relate to my situation. I was moving out of a still occupied house.  The square footage was not relevant but most likely played into the high quote.\nIn other words, best to go with a mover in which the actual mover is going to give you a quote. So, I did. I feel I ended up with a more personal experience.
