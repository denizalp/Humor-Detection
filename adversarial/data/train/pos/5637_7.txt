So I guess I was dragged here with a group of my friends to see a drag show, I usually am down for whatever but this group of girls did not impress me at all. It was one night where they were doing star choice drag show and the talent there was just not talent. Not to mention they jip you on drinks if you pay with a card which I assume most people do. The show was definitely a disappointment, and I'm always one for a good show. Although I can say the Vibe here is a little more chill than Charlies but I won't be returning anytime soon.
