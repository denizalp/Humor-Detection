Me and my husband went to this location for the 1st time. ..we went in right before closing \nreally in the mood for hot fudge Sundays ... The girl says oh sorry we ran out of hot fudge at like 7:00 tonight ..... I mean really ???? Baskin Robbins without hot fudge is like McDonald's without fries !!! I mean the girl could have at least given us a free scoop with the 2 orders we placed!!!... .
