I went here because I really REALLY needed a massage...it was my first time here and I was thoroughly impressed! Being an Esthetician myself I loved the vibe of the place and the cleanliness and layout of the business. I didn't wait long before I was called up to get my massage, getting into the room and it was nice and quiet and warm with a lovely bed and blankets..I was so excited! \nTurns out I had a pinched nerve in my back and the therapist I got actually explained to me where it was, how to help it, and that she has paramedic background! \nI felt AMAZING when I left..considering when I came in I was in so much pain I couldnt even stand up straight!!\n\nThank you Massage Heights!
