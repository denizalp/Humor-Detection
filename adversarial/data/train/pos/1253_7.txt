The fried chicken is delicious. The breading is relatively light while achieving a maximum crispy exterior. It's also seasoned really well with tasty spices allowing the chicken to be eaten without the necessity of sauces. I've tried all of the pieces of the bird: breast, whole wing, thigh (bone-in or boneless), and drumstick, plus tenders. The white meat (breast and tenders) has the tendency to be a tad dry, but the other pieces are really moist and juicy. The boneless thigh is a favorite since you get a lot of meat and it's easy to eat. The chicken can be purchased by the piece ($1.99-$4.95), combo meals served with fries and coleslaw ($6.75-$15.50), family style ($33.95-$41.50), or party platters (starting at $140).\n\nI'm equally in awe of their sauces and the variety. BRBBQ, Wildflower Honey, Wasabi Honey, Chipotle Honey, and Habanero Hot Sauce. My favorite combination is their hot sauce and the wildflower honey; yum! \n\nThe sides are decent. I really like the Pickled Cucumbers, Hush Puppies, and Mashed Potatoes with Gravy. They used to have Collard Greens that I enjoyed, but it's been removed off the menu recently. I haven't tried either salads or the Spicy Slaw. The fries aren't my favorite, but still tasty. The Fries With The Works ($6.50\/$12.50) is heavily loaded with aged cheddar, bacon, and sour cream; good stuff. I added some gravy and it was amazing (too bad that isn't an option on the menu, but I'm sure you can ask for gravy with your \"works\").\n\nI've only had one of their sandwiches, The Blue Bird (blue cheese, red onion, and smoked bacon), which is unique to the Las Vegas location. A good sandwich, but mine was heavy on blue cheese and it overwhelmed the sandwich. I definitely want to try the original sandwich to compare it to other chicken sandwiches in town.\n\nI love that they have Boylan's Fountain Soda. A soda company from New York that was previously offered via bottle only can now be found at BRFC. I love their Ginger Ale and Black Cherry sodas! ($2.50 unlimited refills)\n\nThey have three beers (Maui Brewing Co. Mana Wheat, PBR, and Basin Brewing Co. Icky IPA) on tap and red, white, and sparkling wines on tap.\n\nNutella Milkshake ($4.95): SO GOOD. Thick, tasty, and not too sweet.
