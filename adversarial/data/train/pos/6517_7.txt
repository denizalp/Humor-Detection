What's not to love about Capitano? No, really. Pop quiz, hotshot:\n\nA) My local burger joint is not only still thriving, but becoming revered city-wide\nB) They once let us wait for our takeout with a very well-behaved dog\nC) Everyone I've brought\/sent here (and it's a lot of people) has left smiling\nD) Bueno gelato - as in KINDER BUENO\nE) Also, salted hazelnut gelato\nF) 2 tasty vegetarian options\nG) A fish burger that puts the Filet O' Something to shame\nH) Responsibly-sourced beef\nI) Buns even fluffier than mine\nJ) They have loyalty cards now - buy 10 burgers, get 1 free! (Not the best for my aforementioned fluffy buns, but whatever)\nK) None of the above\n\nThe answer is obviously K.\n\nK!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\nEat fast though, these things are loaded. If your chewing speed drops below 50 MPH, your burger will explode.
