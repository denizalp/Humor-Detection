so i got fired from my job the other day and my best friend said \"let me take you out to lunch for some therapy,\" ie. wine in the afternoon...yes! so i met her downtown and she said \"do you feel like oysters? and i'm like \"just hold my head back and open my mouth and let the booze flow in.\" oysters? really? is that even food? my stomach is in a huge knot so oysters will work just fine because they go down so easy. i do love an oyster on a normal day btw, i am a swallower.\nso we got there, great atmosphere, nice and bright and airy, we bellied up to the bar and was right away made at home by the dudes who worked there. we ordered wine, and some oysters and the fried chicken....fried chicken and oyster might be my new favourite thing EVAR. \nalso protip: whenever you go to a restaurant,  ALWAYS opt to sit at the bar and not a table and if you are having a case of the sads, chances are the bartender will be the cheapest therapist you will ever get. the chase did not disappoint.\nthe shucker, so sweet, gave us a lesson in how different kinds of oysters, who knew there were so many kinds? and without a doubt, and i have sucked back many an oyster, these were the best i've ever had.\nand the fried chicken? i can't even talk about it. there are no words.\nthis is my favourite restaurant in the city.
