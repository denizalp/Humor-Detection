I was in the mood for Italian, but not in the mood to spend the crazy high prices for it in the hotel that I was staying in. Of course I pulled up my Yelp app and Casanova, with good reviews and better prices, fit the bill. \n\nIt's kind of tucked away on the upper floor of the Venetian, past the canal. It's a tiny spot, but I had no problem getting a table right away. Service was quick, bread came almost immediately and my waiter got my drink order out to me within a few minutes. I decided on classic lasagna; sometimes you just need the basics and nothing fancy. This came out really quickly as well. It was a nice serving size; just enough to fill you up but without being overly full. This is just a really simple lasagna with no frills - meat, cheese, sauce, and pasta. Nothing out of this world amazing, but nothing to complain about either. \n\nWith a glass of wine and my lasagna, the total was under $30. Impressive for Vegas considering the high prices just about everywhere. Definitely worth checking out if you want to spend a little less money.
