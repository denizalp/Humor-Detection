this was my first time eating bob zip's food but all i can say is i'm impressed. i'm a vegetarian that loves sushi so finding a good  Japanese and sushi place with a lot of vegetarian options is hard, but this place has so options. i had the veggie rolls and they are some of the best i've tasted. i saw a lot of the reviews were negative but i see no reason why. the place is kind of small but most of my sushi orders are takeout so that isn't a problem. i'll definitely be visiting again to try some of their other options.
