Nothing makes the hair on a laddies chest grow like a robust meal of Haggis, Nips and Tatties, and WHISKEY does. So when a bunch of hairless push-up addicted meatheads decided to gather at my place for man-ly catchups, I had to get my hands on Haggis.\n\nProblem was, I've never had Haggis before and wasn't about to make my own version. Was I too scared? no, I simply needed to try the real McCoy.\n\nSooo a google search led me to this Butcher\/Meat pie shop located just a few blocks from my place in Kingsland. I walked in and they quickly pointed me to their freezer full of frozen haggis, which were priced by the pound. I got a few cooking tips (note: never sauce a Haggis) and off I went.\n\nHow was the Haggis? Delicious, especially with a really peaty scotch. Now if you'll excuse me I have to shave my sweater off.
