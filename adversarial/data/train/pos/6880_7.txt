I didn't have extremely high hopes for this small pizza shop in T.I. but it was convenient for a late night bite since we were staying at the casino. It managed to curb my hunger but didn't leave me wanting more. \n\nI ordered a slice of cheese and a garlic bread with sauce. The pizza was barely warm and would have been much better had it been fully heated. I think the worker only reheated the garlic bread in the oven and the pizza was taken directly from the display, which has heat lamps but definitely was not keeping the pizza super hot. I was surprised to find that my favorite part of the meal was the dipping sauce with the garlic bread. It seemed creamier than usual marinara and had a great flavor. I couldn't get enough and even dipped my pizza in the sauce.
