The prices are great, the food is very good (when you're craving normal Mexican--you know--when you just want that heavy, Americanized Mexican), and the ladies' room is IMMACULATE.  Many, many points.\n\nI had the Azteca combo with mole and a side of the guac. The guac was loaded with fresh-tasting cilantro--which I was really into. However, if you're one of those weirdos who doesn't like cilantro (weirdo!), you might wanna skip the guac.\n\nThe parking lot was packed when we got there (6:30pm on a Thursday).  The secret's out, apparently.\n\nOur waitress was great. Even though it was very crowded, she made time to check on us and bring us whatever we needed.\n\nI didn't have a margarita, but my friends did. The margaritas are super cheap. And my friend said she didn't think there was that much alcohol in them but her high-pitched drunk voice told me otherwise (I was driving, btw--don't worry).\n\nAs I said, the bathroom was IMMACULATE.  Major points, Cuco's.  We'll be back.
