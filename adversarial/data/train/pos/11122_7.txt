I drove 25 minutes each way to come here for a nice dinner out with the kids after reading the reviews with high hopes. Kids and I were excited, but left unimpressed. There are no kids menus which was the first small disappointment. We moved on. I ordered soups for the three of us, crab puffs, shrimp lo mein to start, then lemon chicken, moo shu pork, root beer for the kid, and hot tea for my oldest and I. The tea took around 10 minutes, then came the crab puffs (the puff crab was pretty good). The tea was a full tea pot with 1- yes one tea bag in the entire thing. More like lightly colored water). Next came the lo mein about 10 minutes after that. Then we waited. And waited.\n\n Finally came the moo shu. Here's where the real disappointment starts. The wraps were very dry and stale and broke as soon as I tried filling them. Next came out the lemon chicken. The sauce is on the side and just tasted like honey. The chicken was about as dry as could be and took a crazy amount of pressure to cut into. Now we've been here about an hour and my youngest pipes up asking where his soup is. Kid will only eat lo mein and soup. I flagged down a waiter and asked about the soup. Apparently it was never put in. That was another 15 minutes. By this time he is hungry and grumpy. I'm tired and grumpy. \n\nWe're ready to go, but wait for this soup. Egg drop for him, and wonton for us other 2. Wonton was about as bland as could possibly get. Egg drop was fantastic. Luckily he liked mine better and I ate his. Finally something that tasted good! My oldest says the moo shu was pretty good. So now we're done and yet we sit there waiting and waiting and waiting for the check. I finally went to the counter, paid and left. I think we all agree though that between the wait, the dropped order, the lack of kids dishes, the wait (did I say that already?) and the bland\/chewy\/ dishes we had, we won't be back.
