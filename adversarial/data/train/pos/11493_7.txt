Vincent's Pizza has another spawn, this one having slithered into Lawrenceville shortly after its birth. \n\nKay wanted pizza prior to the Danzig show Friday night. If you know her, you will find that peculiar considering that she is generally averse to pizza for reasons not fully understood by anyone.\n\nWe ordered an 8 cut Meat Lover's, and I was surprised at how it differed from the slices I had the last time I stopped in. \n\nIt's a sloppy, oily pizza, just like Vincent's but tamer; Mighty Joe Young as opposed to King Kong. I.E. it's a bit easier to eat and not as horrifically epic. If Vincent's is too much for your heart to take, try a Supreme Pizza instead. Accessible would be the most appropriate descriptor. \n\nThe crust is angelic, delicate despite it's charred exterior and is worth the price alone. Not that I didn't like my sidewalk cuts from close to a year ago, but the whole pies are even better, stratospherically better. \n\nKay beat me 5 -3. That never happens. If she liked it...\n\nSupport Supreme Pizza ya beatniks. They do good work and are nice people.
