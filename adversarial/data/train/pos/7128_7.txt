I had to give this place three stars because I wasn't as impressed as some of the other reviewers. The sushi was pretty good but the execution lacked creativity. All three of the rolls we ordered were placed on a plate with a dollop of sauce - nothing fancy to see here folks. \n\nI agree with one review here about the fish being cut too thick. The fish should be cut delicately thin, if you want to be authentic. \n\nThe ambience could be so much better without the tvs. If I want to catch the game I can walk down to Buffalo Wild Wings! They're so out of place!!! Get rid of the tvs, paint some Japanese anime in their place and you have appropriate ambience. \n\nFinally, the service was slow even though the place was almost empty when we came here. We had to ask for ginger and wasabi, too.
