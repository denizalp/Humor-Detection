This was tough to review... Good food, but gets only 2 stars because of SCAM TACTICS!\n\n** You will be forced to drink and pay for tea! **\n\nFOOD - Above Average\n\nThe cooking is very good, but it has limited choices because of cultural differences. Several dishes involve Chicken Feet, Pig Feet, Cow Tongue, Pig Intestines. \n\nHere are some items I ordered:\n\n1. Shrimp Spring Roll: Very crispy, and has actual shrimp inside.\n2. Vegetable Spring Roll: Greasy inside and out. Greasier than the shrimp one!\n3. BBQ Pork Buns: Great!\n4. Chicken Buns: Great!\n5. Rice wraps: Very greasy meat fillings. Lacked taste.\n6. Rice Hot Pot with Chicken: Very tender chicken, too much rice.\n7. Fried Dumping: Lacked taste.\n\nSERVICE - Good and Bad\n\nThe good part is that when the staff saw I was looking up pictures on Yelp to help identify what we can eat, she brought over a menu with pictures. \n\nThe bad is the TEA.\n\nLet me tell you about the tea...\n\nAs soon as we sat down, they brought tea to the table. I thought, \"Free tea? I thought it was $0.80 per person.\" And sure enough, when we get the bill, the tea charge is on there. Not a nice way to make money off of unsuspecting customers.\n\nSo when we went to pay, I didn't even want to pay for more than 5% tips, since they slapped that unasked-for tea charge on there. BUT THE WAITRESS ACTUALLY COMMANDED US TO PAY 10% TIPS.\n\nKind of a dirty strategy.\n\nPRICE - Mid-range\n\nIt came to $20 for 7 items in the end, thanks to tea. The price is pretty low per item, but that tea made us feel like we were scammed. \n\nSo if you ever go there, tell them \"No\" to the tea, BEFORE they put it in your table.
