Absolutely love LUSH. I've been to this LUSH a couple of times and each time the staff is extremely helpful with what our bath needs are. A helpful staff member would suggest different lotions and scrubs that would best suit your skin type. This time around we opted for a bath bomb and a bubble bar.  It is defiantly super difficult picking just one due to all the colorful eye catching products. Per the wonderful staffs suggestion we picked a sex bomb and a rose (I think) bubble bar. I feel like I ran out of the shop and ran into our suit to throw these suckers in our bath. I was so relaxed and came out feeling like silk! Not only was this an amazing body experience it's also guilt free with absolutely NO animal testing or by products. Makes a girl want to live in lathering with LUSH products.\n\n\n40 of 100- Yelp challenge 2016
