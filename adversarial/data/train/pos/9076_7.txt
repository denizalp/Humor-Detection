I came here to get a simple oil change. As I left my car here I waited in the waiting room. I patiently waited 30 minutes and was wondering what was going on since an oil change takes around 20 minutes or less at a professional shop. \n\nThe owner comes back out and tells me my break pads are leaking and they are legally not allowed to let me drive my car. I would have to leave my car overnight and printed a quote of 900 dollars. I then asked help from another mechanic to come over and prove them all wrong. The owner was furious as he returned my car keys. I quickly left after paying for an oil change and would never come back. Please do not bring your car here.\n\nThe people in this shop are all scammers and are out to milk as much money they possibly can from people who do not know much about cars.
