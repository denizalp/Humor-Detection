This is a top notch hotel and spa. The pool is beautiful and huge. The entire grounds are tranquil and relaxing. Service is great and restaurants and shops are excellent and convenient.  Rooms are comfortable and extremely clean and well kept. The bed was very comfortable.  It doesn't hurt that there always seemed to be extremely hot women wandering around the place. I would definitely stay here again.
