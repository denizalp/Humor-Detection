Take a quick look at yer skin color right quick cuz this ain't no wing place, it's a Roti shop boy. Belieee dat. \n\nWhatever you decide to order lemme talk to ya, mainly to you white folk - please please be careful on what kinda hotness level you choose, this ain't wing toppings, it's straight up spice and when they tell you it going to be spicy; that's brown for multiply that by three. \n\nIf you experienced Roti and brown food then this place will bring you home. It's straight outta the south (asia).  \n\nUneducated folks start googlin'. The chickens spiced deliciously, God dam. The breas cooked up to par and toasted as perfect as can be. When you open up the Roti you got the korma lookin' mixed with butter tastin and if you brave enough, spicy flakin (I know.. I'm a loser)  but seriously they mix It up with potatoes as well and cook it very evenly. \n\nNow here's the problem.. There's way too much korma or butter or whatever they mixed to make the tastey goo, slim that down a bit and it be perfect. \n\nNext problem... Unless you're going in at lunch.. A Roti gonna cost a brotha 14$ and add another 3 if you want rice. I ain't complaining about portion size cuz it's dam good amount but this is considered fast food Indian style so charging 14$ is robbery which is why if you step into this place at night it's lookin like the real Sahara. \n\nMomma approves but her bank account don't. Awesome tastin place tho.
