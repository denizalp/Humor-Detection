Well, just like everyone else in vegas nobody listens. Ordered a brisket sandwich and was given pulled pork. Took one bite and threw it away. Wasn't what I asked for. Went 10 minutes before close today, and although I felt slightly rushed I now know they just wanted to leave. Couldn't even be bothered to listen to what I ordered. Can't rate the food bc I threw it away. Going to get poke next door, they never mess up my order. Doubtful I will return. \n\nUnfortunately my diet gives me 1 cheat meal, this was a waste of time. I did try the red potato salad. Pretty bland, I've made better.
