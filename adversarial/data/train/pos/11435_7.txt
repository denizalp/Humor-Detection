I could spend all day shopping on Bastille Day (today).  I skulk around marvelling at all the French themed stuff I could buy.  But then there's food.  I may currently be banned from buying candles, jewelry, or accessories but not comestibles. But I am prudent.  If it says organic, brown, seeds or nut...then it's permissible.  I pass by the cocktail jelly bellies in mint mojito, passion midori & mouthwatering cosmo along with the Harry and David moose crunch.  I see organic mixers but don't need any.  We already have chia seeds.  Yep, time for organic brown rice ramen cakes plus a giant dole of organic sunflower seeds.  Maybe even try them together.  I'll be back for other strange combinations.
