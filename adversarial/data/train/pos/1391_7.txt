I think Fast Eddie's beats 5 & Diner any day!\n\nAs a '50's style diner, you'll find all the classics on the menu: juicy burgers, tasty fries, and of course, creamy, delicious milk shakes.  '50's music blasts from the juke box and the staff dresses up too.\n\nI've had the grilled cheese, french fries and an oreo shake.  Everything was delish in every way.\n\nThere is no healthy food here- so if you're wanting to stay away from grease, calories and fat, don't come to Eddie's.  But if you like to get away from reality for awhile and pretend you live in a time when people don't have to lock their doors and Elvis is still alive, this is the place to do it.
