I stumbled upon this place with one of my friends when we were looking for a chill place to grab a pint. As you walk in, you're greeted by a lot of wood and an empty bar. It's empty not because of service or the product but because of the killer back patio area. Once outside, you're surrounded by towering brick walls covered in vegetation and lit up like some magical drinking garden-esque place. The beer selection is also pretty good. They have a good selection of local brews and a handful of imports. No matter what you choose the ambience is what makes this place. I came back with some other friends later on my trip. This is not a place to miss!
