''Twas the day before Christmas Eve and my group of girls decided to do Pickleback shots and eat before delving into last minute Christmas shopping. Doubly crazy doesn't even describe our decisions that morning to do so but one thing is for sure, the Crab and Mermaid was great to us!\n\nThe Mussels served with bread had a lovely broth that shared a nice rosemary flavor but not too overpowering. \n\nCrab Club - toasted bread layered with large lumps of crab meat, bacon and avocado. I ordered this with a salad and it was great\n\nPo-boy - beer battered and tasty. It was alongside a hearty serving of salty fresh chips\n\nPoke burrito- my friend was adventurous and created her own burrito. There's a little order form where you could mark what you wanted in your burrito. Poke was a new addition to the menu so she went for it and wasn't disappointed. \n\nIt took awhile for us to decide, especially since not all of arrived on time at 11am but the staff was very patient and we still had amazing service!
