My 700th review goes toward a night of decadent eating!\n\nParties of four are really one of the best ways to experience a menu.  With drinks in hand, we took our seats at a table by the floor-to-ceiling glass walls separating us from the outside world.\n\n* Trio of Duck Fat fries with dipping sauces of barbecue, truffle aioli, and ketchup - This complimentary dish was the first to arrive, and yes, they are very delicious and decadent, and oh so good and fatty.  A great way to start any meal!\n\n* Potato Focaccia - More complimentary stuff to get your palate going, although I found to be just okay, the Husband enjoyed it more. \n\n* Maine Lobster \"bacon-wrapped fritters\" ($17) - Skewered lobster with bacon wrapped around, and then deep-fried.  A refreshing dipping sauce to cut the fat!\n\n* Roasted Beets \"burrata, walnut oil\" ($15) - The fresh Italian cheese, greens, and beets had the three men at my table fighting over the last bits.\n\n* Filet Tartare \"american kobe filet, classic garnish, grilled pocket bread\" ($21) - Beautifully presented with the rare beef and a raw quail egg resting on top.  Garnishments of mustard, cracked pepper, red onions and the like surrounded it before the waiter artfully mixed it all together and presented it in chilled glass.  So tastefully good, you don't need or want the bread.  \n\n* Shabu Shabu \"american kobe beef, mushroom consomme\" ($24) - A pot of hot broth took center stage as enoki mushrooms wrapped in beef arrived.  A quick swish and a dip of sauce and into your mouth it goes.\n\n* Angus Beef Cap ($46) - We all ordered this off-menu cut of beef.  I initially wanted it rare, but was dissuaded to have it medium rare instead.  Cutting into my beef, it was more medium and I was saddened.  A quick glance around the table, and I realized my piece was definitely more cooked than most.  Lucky for me, the Husband was willing to switch his piece with mine.  (That act alone makes him a keeper!)  Once I cut into my newly acquired beef, I was enjoying my medium rare slice with everyone else.  \n\n* Mac & Cheese \"truffled\" ($12) - Yes, it's all that and a bag of chips.  So creamy and good, and not just a hint of the truffle, but it's all over! So yum!  Worth ordering on its own.\n\n* Scalloped Potatoes \"caramelized onion & goat cheese\" ($12) - The onions give this dish a sweetness that complements the goat cheese and potatoes.  \n\n* Potato Puree Trio \"lobster, sour cream & onion, horseradish\" ($14) - My personal fave over the other potato dish.  With so many variations of mashed potatoes, how can one not like them.  Very smooth, creamy, and just something you want to eat all to yourself.\n\n* Creamed Corn \"jalapeno\" - I guess we needed some kind of vegetable to offset our meal.  A slight bit of heat from the pepper and it's more creamy goodness.\n\n* Beignets \"Chocolate Pot de Creme, Macallan 18 Year Butterscotch Pudding, Madagascar Vanilla Creme Brulee\" - Take a spoon to the cr√®me brulee and forget the beignets, just hog the pot to yourself.  Dipping wise, I liked the chocolate over the butterscotch in this case.\n\n* Coconut Candy Bar \"Caramel Ice Cream, Toasted Almonds\" ($12) - A very fancy candy bar that's super sweet, and perfect for sharing.\n\n* Cucumber Martini - Surprisingly better than other cucumber martinis out there, good enough that everyone at my table was having one because they are that good.\n\n* Cherry Caiprihana - The Husband enjoyed this signature drink of theirs as well, and the cherry adds a unique taste to the caiprihana.\n\nThe service at Strip Steak was probably among the best.  There's a team waiting on you, and they work as a team - with not just clearing dishes, but bringing your orders in and chatting it up with you.  One of the more personal and better customer service experiences I've had in awhile.  Michael Mina obviously knows what he's doing with his food and his staff.  It's no wonder there's a cult following of his restaurants.  They also have restrooms within the restaurant, which is a nice touch. (Most restaurants in the casinos don't have their own restrooms, so you're forced to walk through the casino to use it.)  But there can be a line, which is the downfall of it.\n\nMy suggestion is to gather a few friends, and only a few, and share a wonderful meal with them all.  With a party of five or more, it's harder to share the appetizers and sides.  You'll share an intimate culinary adventure with them!\n\n4.5 stars
