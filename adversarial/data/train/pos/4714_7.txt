This place is several floors of unassuming grey\/brown brick. My first time there I saw a number of shady nogoodniks loading things out of a van in an alley. Then I realized they were my friends. It was dark and we're musicians. Sue me. \n\nThe Rehearsal Factory is one of the few places I've found in Toronto that has a fair balance between price, availability and quality facilities. They are not the cleanest, but they do their best. They are not the cheapest, but they come close. They do have good sized rooms though and the sound proofing is better than other places I've been too. \n\nTheir bathrooms are a decent size and have a shower but I'm not sure you would want to use it. If you've ever been on a tour bus you'll know why. It might be worth it to mention that the room is entirely covered in tile with stainless steel sink and toilet so everything can be steam blasted clean with ease.\n\nThe odd thing about this place is that it's partially condo space so you have to clear out at 11pm. That's more than an inconvenience when you've been slaving away for hours trying to figure out a song and you're kicked out just as it finally comes to you. It's not always possible to put yourself back in that creative space and pick up where you left off even if you've been recording everything up till that point. \n\nEveryone I've dealt with here, staff and musicians alike, have been great. They all seem to respect each others space and I've had some great conversations about who's making what type of music and why. \n\nIf you happen to be looking for studio space I would suggest you drop by and take a look.
