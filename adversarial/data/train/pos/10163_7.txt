If you have ever gone to a Kanye West Concert, where he did 3 songs and left, went to see Brittany Spears Live, and realized she was lip syncing, ran off to one of the Chopper's Tobin Auto Stores, and found the car that was advertised was $2000 extra if you wanted an engine, then you understand the disappointment we experienced when we ate at this place.\n\nWe truly felt cheated, and unsatisfied when we left. \n\nOn the surface, the price of $25.95 for All You Can Eat, sounds like a reasonable value. However, after studying the Menu, I concluded that unless you were stoned, and had a terrible case of the \"munchies\", or just pigged out and added a couple of inches to your waist line, you could probably do better ordering ala carte. \n\nWe proceeded to order everything we would have ordered, as though we were doing the AYCE.\nThe servers were polite and respectful. The place was packed; not one empty table. Then came the food. We began to realize that the magic of Christmas had come to an end. \n\nThe portions were very small, even for Tapas, the presentation was non existant, and the quality was on par with Popeye's or KFC.  My wife ordered the Kim Chie Fried Rice, a standard for any Korean eating establishment.  She is Korean and she was not pleased with the taste. \n\nThe skewers served were smaller portions than those served for appetizers at a Wedding. \n\nWe ordered enough stuff that we were both full when we finished. But we felt cheated. Yes, we were full, but we did not enjoy our meals.\n\nFor the record, our combined check was $32.00, almost $20 less than if we ordered ACYE. \n\nRegardless of price, this was not a quality meal, and unless you are in the condition I mentioned above, this is not a good value for the money. \n\nI know my friends in Yelp gave it an average of 4 stars, but in this case, I was not impressed, and will not be returning to this place.
