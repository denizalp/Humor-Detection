So here it goes... I'm not a fan of clubs. especially over priced ones in Vegas. My friends wanted to go to a club so i said what the hell. We ended up getting into Rain free with bottle service. once i walked in i was in awe. \n\nthere were cirque de solei type people with weird ass get up's hanging from the ceiling twirling up and down. there was another guy on stilts walking around looking creepy but seemed to be dancing to the beat. there were balcony's, about 3-5 levels over looking the dance floor. the music was great. it was a trance drum and bass kinda thing mixed by DJ Icey. \n\ni went to the bar and ordered my usual rum and coke to begin the night. the bartender said 8 bucks. 8 bucks?? that's awesome! they're usually 14 bucks at pure. the crowd was cool everyone was completely enthralled by the dancers and the good music. the security was lax. there was this over-sized Manny Ramirez looking guy watching over our table whom would move anyone that blocked our view of what was over the balcony. \n\nall-in-all, it was a pleasant experience, i wouldn't mind going back here in the future.
