If you're into really loud metal tunes (think AC\/DC), scantily clad servers (some of whom perhaps ought not be wearing such miniature sized clothing), mediocre but not inexpensive food, and shockingly slow service, the new Solon Panini's is the place is for you!!  We waited 50 minutes before even an appetizer was placed on our table, all the while stomaching the painfully bad metal oldies that  reverberated off the hardwood floors and stone walls.  By the time the appetizer arrived, we were hungry enough to be giving serious consideration to eating our napkins. Yet even in this condition, we rated the stale tortilla chips with a scant sprinkling of jalapenos and cheese as barely passable.  The restaurant's claim to fame -- its overstuffed sandwich -- was nothing to write home about either.  It was basically an ounce of overcooked meat hidden within a half a loaf's equivalent of dry bread with some other stuff jammed in there for good measure.   One positive:  the beer was dirt dog cheap. Upon reflection, I should have kept them coming.  As a brand new restaurant, Panini's has got some work to do before it will be recognized as a great eatery.  I think I'll rely on some other Yelper to check back at a later date and see if they've worked out the kinks.
