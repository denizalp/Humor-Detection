I bought a Travelzoo Local Deal to use here.  It sounded like such a great deal - $39 for 2 entrees, 2 apps and 2 beers (regularly $76) and you get to watch a game on top of it.  Well, I could not have been more wrong! I tried twice to make reservations to watch football here.  Both times I was told that I would be charged an additional $50 in order to get seating where I could view a game.  What? I bought this deal since it was advertised as being able to come watch a game and enjoy dinner.  The choice given to me was to sit on the patio with no televsion access if I was going to be able to use the deal with Travelzoo.  Their explanation has been \"mangement  reserves all rights\".  I guess they do have the right to use false advertisement and not honor the deals that they have offered to locals.
