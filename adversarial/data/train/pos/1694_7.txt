This bar is as country as Taylor Swift and the drinks are just as hard as T-Swift's rock and roll. \n\nTook about ten minutes before a legitimate country artist was played on a Saturday night. Drinks are pricey and good whiskey is (smaybe not surprisingly) completely absent from the liquor menu. New mMs for the bar may be \"Bad 80's Hits brings you Cheap Beer\". \n\nSorry Dierks, your bar gets two stars. \n\nPlus side: anyone looking for a non-country bar with humans drinking alcohol can find that here on the weekends.
