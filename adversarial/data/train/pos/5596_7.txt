Nuestra Paloma, \"our dove\" en espanol, is an elegant elderflower-laced cocktail in the guise of a laid-back summer fling.  A libation that is not on any menu in Las Vegas; however, metaphorically defines Eastside Lounge.\n\nThe queue at XS was well... in \"excess\"; Therefore, friends and I decided to start our own party at Eastside Lounge or more aptly named \"Funside\" lounge because we brought the fun [don't laugh].  \n\nThink velvet sex and lip succulent drinks.  The lounge itself is small but very nice.  Plush deep reds and purples draped over windows, couches, and overly stuffed chairs.  The perfect place to just relax and people watch in the casino.\n\nThe waitstaff at Funside was very attentive, nice, and welcoming.  In addition to their extensive cocktail menu, Funside happily obliged my request for something I'd been jonesin' for... my unicorn of drinks; the nuestra paloma.\n\nEastside Lounge is that hotel bar which sinfully placates to ones need of a drink, a zino platinum, and a great conversation.\n\nFor those interested: \nIt consists of any silver or clear tequila, st. germain, contreau, lime, angostura bitters, grapefruit zest, fresh muddled grapefruit juice, and a twitst of grapefruit rind.
