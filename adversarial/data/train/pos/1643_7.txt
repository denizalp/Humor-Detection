day 17 already\n\ni think of that song. should i stay or should i go now. if i stay there will be trouble. if i go there will be double. i miss my family already and waking up to an empty house in vegas. maybe i should have stayed in portland longer. but the idea of me staying anywhere too long sounds dreadful and me leaving places seems to upset others. my dad is getting really old...\n\ndamn i feel worthless today. like i haven't accomplished anything in a while. i'm hungry. i need a burrito. i came here on the recommendation of a friend i am staying with. without jiu jitsu friend and yelp friends i would be really screwed. this place is in an area thats being bulldozed and redeveloped. the inside is typical mexican taco spot. the burritos are huge and cheap! very cheap. i had a chorrizo burrito for breakfast and now i need a nap.
