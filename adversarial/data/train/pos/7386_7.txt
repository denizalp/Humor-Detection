Unbelievable...we usually frequent this place once a month for the last 8 months and gradually service has been getting poor. Today was the last straw for us...\n\nWe are a party of 5...wanted to bring my nephew here because he's never been. We were seated promptly. The restaurant wasn't crowded at all. But we waited. And waited...20 mins and no one has even come by to get our drink orders. It wasn't until one of the waitresses that was tending to a nearby table turned to Waitress #2 and very politely said, \"You know that's your table.\" Waitress #2 peered over to our table continued to pick up after an empty table and turned and walked away. Quite a surprise at the lack of customer service today...enough for us to just get up and leave right now. LITERALLY just walking out...\n\nWe will continue to go to EggWorks but we much prefer the service at the 215 & Rainbow location.
