I signed up for Rachael's Thursday night TRX class through ClassPass.  Fitness in Motion is the complete opposite of a big box gym.  It's on the smaller side and besides small group classes it appears to cater to personal training.  After the warm up we were split up into two groups.  One doing exercises on the TRX and the other doing body weight, ab and band exercises.  Midway through we took a little jog and then switched sides.  The class is only 30 minutes which can be a plus or a minus depending on how you are feeling that day, but if you're a member of 24 it's in the adjoining parking lot, plus the surrounding neighborhood is perfect for a walk or jog pre or post one of these classes.  But I definitely worked up a sweat in that 30 minutes because there isn't down time minus a short water break   \n\nI could tell that the members are regulars and very friendly with each other.  This is another reason I'm a fan of the smaller class format is the camaraderie.  What I thought was a really nice touch was Rachael texting me the following Monday to touch base about my experience.
