When you have a health scare and you need to get a mammogram it can be a very scary thing. I am so thankful to have found this Assuredimaging. The staff was so nice. The tech who assisted me was so kind and respectful. It can be nervous to stand in a room ready to show your tatas in front of a lady you do not know but my technician  was wonderful.  She has been in this industry for years  and it shows. The respectfulness from her meant so much to me. Trust me your tatas are put in some weird machines and you feel uncomfortable but my tech was funny and helped me feel at peace. Especially when you are unsure about the outcome. \n\nThe place is nice and relaxing with comfortable changing rooms. Plus you get sent home with a beautiful rose.
