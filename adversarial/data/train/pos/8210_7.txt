I have no idea what the appeal of this place is.  It's a bunch of random food scattered on a bar or randomly tossed on your plate. It breaks up any kind of conversation you might be having with whomever you're with.  And honestly, it's jut not all that good.  It's not bad, but it's not worth the cost.  Cocktails are way over-priced...I don't know what to say.  We walked out of there feeling taken advantage of and wishing we had just gone someplace where you, y'know, like just eat a meal rather than a place where you had to flag down your food like an NYC cab.  Maybe this is Brazil paying back Western Culture for what the Portuguese and Dutch did back to them in the 1600s?  I mean, I felt pretty vanquished after the whole ordeal...
