Restaurant Week Meal #9 - the finale (Dinner for $40.13):\nStarter: Lobster Bisque OR Spinach Salad\nEntree: Pressed Half Herbed Chicken OR Grilled Filet Mignon OR Fresh Halibut\nDessert: Chocolate Molten Lava Cake OR Creme Brûlée\n\nI wanted my last RW meal to be special so I joined other Yelpers who wanted to go here even though this was far from home. I saw this place is highly-rated so I ditched my other RW options. Big mistake! I guess things went downhill after the last 4 or 5-star review.\n\nLobster Bisque:\nThis was the best part of the meal. There were chunks of lobster at the bottom. April had some shells in hers. 3\/5\n\nGrilled Filet Mignon:\nCame with mashed potatoes and broccoli. I always get mine done medium-rare. I got a super dead cow that burned in hell. It was tender but was way overcooked. Everyone at our table who got the filet said the same thing. 2\/5\n\nCreme Brûlée:\nNothing to write home about. The consistency was a bit runny and they don't use real vanilla. 2\/5\n\nStrawberry Shortcake (cocktail menu for $10):\nPineapple vodka, vanilla vodka, amaretto, creme de coco, fresh muddled strawberries. Good drink that tasted like dessert. 4\/5\n\nIt was a very disappointing meal. I should've went with my other options. Last and worst RW meal this season. But I enjoyed the company.
