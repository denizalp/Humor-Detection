The cheese buns look way better in pictures than it tastes. There was nothing special about it....feel like I could make something similar at home for a fraction of the cost. It was a piece of bread that they spread creamy cheese on it. I also read that it should be 5 layers... but it seems to be 2 layers of cheese? \n\nThe buns were also prepackaged in clear plastic bags already. It was really a let down...especially at approximately $7 a piece after tax. I'd pass on this one. Also, they mixed up my order...I ordered a mango one, and they gave me a strawberry. Even after the guy explained each of their buns and really sold me on the mango.
