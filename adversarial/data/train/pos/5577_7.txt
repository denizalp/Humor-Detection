Each time we go, there seems to be a problem. I went to buy lunch for my staff on Saturday, the gentleman that was working was making a pizza, so i had to wait until he was done.(which was fine). However most of the pizzas where not in the show cases but on counters everywhere. I ordered 3 slices and asked to have it in a pizza box. He told me it would not fit. I said it would. So he takes three slices and stacks them and shoves them into a small box, the lid could not shut so he squishes the pizzas. what a mess. i love picking my toppings off the bottom of a plate.\nthen when it comes to pay he rings it threw the registrar and says it is $18.05. as i give him cash, i asked for the invoice , then jumped to get the calculator tried to pretend to do some calculations (because he over charged me). it was $15 and change.\n\nso this place rips you off- squishes your pizza and some burns them.
