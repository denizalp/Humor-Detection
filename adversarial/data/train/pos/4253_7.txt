What a place for meat lovers. This store is a mecca of all things carnivore. There is a giant meat locker, butchery and a potpourri of local produce and unique farm items. Tonight is a one year anniversary party at OCP. I was invited by a friend to enjoy music, charcuterie, and a little wine. \n\nOCP prides themselves in grass fed beef. The selection always looks wonderful and fresh. The staff is always friendly and helpful. Especially if you are unfamiliar with what kind of meet you need or how to cook certain meats. Sometimes I struggle with that, so I always ask for advice. \n\nOverall, this is a great local butcher shop in Ohio City. I always support local when I can. I highly recommend a visit.
