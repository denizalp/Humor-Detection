This club is atrocious. The customer service here is non-existent. The bouncers were awful to my friends and threatened to kick them out of the hotel, because one of them was drunk enough to get on the stripper pole. The place is tiny, the lines were huge, and it's extremely overpriced because it's in Aria.\n\nThere were really no redeeming parts of this place and there are MUCH better clubs elsewhere. I went to the Venetian's club that has a stand-in pool you can be in while you dance, and it was 10x better experience than this place. Would recommend spending the time to look at reviews and check out other hotspots, as this place won't give you a good time.
