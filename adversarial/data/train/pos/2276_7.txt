The kids and I love this park. They really decorate great for Christmas, have a lot of things for the kids to do. The only thing I don't like is that they recently went up to 2 tickets per ride for the meri go round and the train ride. When you have a bunch of people it can get pretty expensive when you ride each ride a few times. The prices on ice cream are great though compared to most ice cream joints!
