What a great addition to the NLV community. Park is humongous with multiple play grounds, a skatepark, basketball courts, tennis courts, dog parks, baseball fields, covered picnic tables for small to large events for rent, picnic tables first come first serve, and a lot of grass space to just run around, oh...and an area where you can rent space to garden. \n\nThere's lots to do at this park so bring the kids or the furry kids out for a picnic and to deflate some air in their tire. They'll definitely find more than enough of climbing, sliding, running, etc...\n\nGrab a sack of all the balls your bag can handle because this place will cover all your ball needs. ::smirk::.\n\nIf there's one thing I'm happy to have while living in North Las Vegas, it's this park! Events are hosted here as well as concerts at the amphitheater. \n\nHighly recommend! Great place for a jog while pushing a stroller! \n\nEnjoy!
