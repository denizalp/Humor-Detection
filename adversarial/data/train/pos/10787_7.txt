finally got to try Shake Shack and the burger is not bad at all. i ordered the shackburger -- just a simple burger on a potato bun and you get the usual sliced tomatoes, lettuce and cheese. Overall the burger itself is not bad. Like i said it's very simple and will satisfy your burger craving. None of those fancy schmancy burgers. But for a simple burger like so, it was a bit expensive. \n\nthe shake was delicious. i ordered the oatmeal cream pie shake since it was limited time offer and OH MY....i felt like i was eating a cookie but blended in milk. that strong oatmeal cinnamon flavor -- it was SO good. \n\ni enjoyed my oatmeal cream pie shake more than the burger.
