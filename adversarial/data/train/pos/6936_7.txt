They only have two kinds of collision damage waiver (CDW\/LDW):-\nEither with a deductible of 1500 or 750. \nThey don't offer lesser deductibles.\nWith Ontario's No fault law, this means that even if you get a scratch, you pay for it out of your pocket, unless you can prove that its not your fault.\nNow that's where it becomes interesting, when you get into an accident, you don't get any help from the rental company.\nThe rental car company promptly charges your credit card for the damages, but provides no help at all in filing a claim for the accident with the other party or any other help of any kind. You are left on your own to file for damages, and this is in spite of buying CDW from them.\nDecided, never again to rent a car from them.\nBy the way, they are also an affiliate of Fox Rent a Car of USA.
