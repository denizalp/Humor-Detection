This was my first time here and I took my family along.  We had karnache plate and kebapcheta plate. My hubby had tripe soup. The food was delicious. The Bulgarian cheese on top of the fries was heavenly tasty (much better quality than any Greek cheese I ever had). The ambience was modern and fun. Very clean too. The service was great and everyone was very friendly. You feel right at home and welcomed even if you have never been there before. I would highly recommend this place with authentic Bulgarian food and friendly staff.
