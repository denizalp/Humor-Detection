Hidden in The beautiful housing development of Verrado this place is amazing! Great location with parking on the street and plenty of outside seating. The building is gorgeous and even has some cool lofts upstairs. It's a very popular place for locals and I can see why. When you walk in the Decor is great. With a comfy couch, tables and a side bar area every table was full. The menu was wonderful. Full of lattes, cold brew, hot and iced coffees, lemonade, tea you name it. Great food selection and I could see myself here very often for healthy breakfast options, coffee and chats with friends. Right away the baked goods catch your eye.  I can't wait to try one of their cinnamon rolls on my next visit. Today I had my heart set on a lavender honey latte and a yogurt granola bowl. My barista and cashier was amazing. So friendly, talkative, smiling and even complimented my purse. She really made the place inviting and made me feel so welcome. Like I had bee there a million times. I had my latte and bowl in minutes. First drink and I was hooked! I've had quite s few lavender lattes and they've only ever been decent.. It was delicious. Hot, flavorful, not overpowering, and left me wanting more and more. My yogurt bowl was picture perfect, fresh fruit, granola and just the right amount of yogurt. I can't wait to come back with friends. It was a perfect end to my hike. If you're in Buckeye I highly recommend the stop. It's s perfect place for working with their free WiFi!
