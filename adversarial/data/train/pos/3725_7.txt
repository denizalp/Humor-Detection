Went last night. I was there about 1 am. Felt pretty uncomfortable with all of the security guys with FBI Looking wires in their ears. So they have these roped of areas all around the perimeter of the back room where every one was. The tables behind the ropes were all empty. I guess these were the bottle areas? I dunno. Maybe.  In any case if they want people to come they need top make them comfortable. Five, yes five serious looking straight looking bouncer types before you were allowed to pay the $20 cover to enter into what looked like the dead zone. Nice bartender but, seriously,  plastic?  Got a kettle one on the rocks. Big rocks little kettle if you knows what i mean.\nOkay. They did have a bizarre show. I just didn't get it. These boys did their show with those home depot dusk masks on. Let me say there must have been some message in the choreography but i missed it. I'm sure it's me, but except for the photographer i really didn't see anyone paying attention. Dull. I'll say it again, dull.\nMaybe I'm old school but I'd take a decent drag queen show over this any day. \nKudos to the dj. He was spot on.\nGood luck liaison. Hope you can change fast enough to be relevant and fun. Two stars because i think that this is important for our community.
