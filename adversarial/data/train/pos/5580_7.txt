Probably the best looking steak house in all of Toronto!  This place attracted me due to the exterior, I always thought the mansion looked haunted with the creepy lightning and decor.  From the parking lot to the front entrance, you'll feel like you're stepping into a horror movie!  I kind of wish there was a ghost or horror movie theme, at least around Halloween time.  I know I would be making reservations for that!\n\nThe service here is what you would expect from any Keg.  Great, fast and friendly staff from the host at the front, to the servers inside.  The food comes out quick, and the steaks are always cooked to perfection.     I've never had a steak under or over cooked at any Keg to be honest.  I usually order the prime rib and it's plenty of meat to fill me up to the point where I have to pass on dessert. \n\nOverall a great steakhouse and what makes this place even better is the location and decor.  This place looks straight out of a Hollywood movie, and you'll feel an interesting vibe having dinner here.  Highly recommended if you're in the area and looking for a classy steak dinner.
