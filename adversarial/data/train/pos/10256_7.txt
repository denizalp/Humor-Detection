This is the first store to open in the new Pinecrest mall development. \n\nGrand opening celebration will be combined with anniversary celebration in a couple weeks. Hence special promotion will take place then.\n\nThe parking lot still is construction area so take caution and use the entrance indicated by the signs. Don't use the construction entrance \n\nThere are free classes you can sign up for. The classroom is not set up yet but I believe it will be once the classes start.
