So, I'm a fairly seasoned drinker, but still fall prey to the dreaded \"Asian Glow\". Ergo, this is probably my favorite bar based on the dim lighting alone... It's so dark, one can barely read the menu, much less notice that I have morphed into the Grimace after my second vodka tonic.\n\nThe $10 cocktails are good and strong. Parking is ample, and the patio will be great in just a few short weeks!
