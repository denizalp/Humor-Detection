I don't know exactly what it is that I love so much about Happy Dog, but this is definitely one of my favorite places in CLE.  Maybe it's the dive-y atmosphere, maybe it's the great selection of beers, maybe it's those tots - whatever it is, it keeps pulling me back for more. \n\nI will say that I've never ordered a hotdog from this place (a sin, i know!) but I've done the drinks and the tots (including the never ending list of dipping sauces) and they're both freaking awesome.  \n\nI've always had great service here and honestly, it beats my expectations for a place that can get incredibly packed and has more of a bar feel than restaurant.  I've never waited long for a food order, nor has any group I've been with, and if the crowd isn't too large you can have some pretty great conversations with one of the many awesome bartenders.  \n\nAgain, I'm not sure what it is that keeps luring me back so if you want see why I love this little place so much I guess you have to experience it for yourself.  The bf and I have taken plenty of out of towners to Happy Dog and every single one of them has always made it a point for us to take them back.  There's something about it, now you just need to go to find out!
