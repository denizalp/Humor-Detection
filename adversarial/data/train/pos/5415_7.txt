I was on a hunt during a busy summer weekend to get my toes done and really the best time I could figure to get them done was a Sunday morning. Well as you probably know, that's not a time most salons are open. Nails X to the rescue! \n\nIt is on Albemarle Road so I had limited expectations about the decor\/ambiance and it's just about exactly what you'd expect from a cheap nail salon. The massage chairs aren't the best, cheesy graphics, etc. but that's totally OK because they're open Sunday mornings and the price is good. Plus they had a religious broadcast on (first Joel Osteen then Elevation broadcast) so I could both get saved AND save my janky toes. DOUBLE BONUS. \n\nBut there were two problems. One is that since Sunday morning was slow I was a captive audience for a while and apparently my tech was a Joel Osteen fan because as soon as that show wrapped up my tech talking to me about uber crazy drama with their ex. I won't get into it but sounded like the tech had asked several other clients their take too which would make sense if they're regulars but I was a first timer. \n\nThe main problem was that I was in such a rush to get out of there that I didn't check the polish job and unfortunately it was full of bubbles but once I realized it I didn't want to go back to get it fixed and get trapped. They didn't have Essie polish which is my preference and I should have brought my own.
