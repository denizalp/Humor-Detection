Um, so as a venue, it's pretty. The bathrooms were clean and the standing area was good. Lighting and sound are great also. I like the second level. Up there would also be the VIP area, for all you fancy fuckers. \n\nBut god damn it if this isn't perfectly tailored to douchebags. They're everywhere. \n\nDid I come on a day where I wasn't gonna take any crap? Perhaps. But when the people outside checking my ID and ticket are chattering away talking about getting super drunk and stoned and this girl is such a slut... nah thx. \n\nA girl passed out on the floor between the opener and the main attraction. We tried to get security's attention. Where was security? We used flashlights to try to alert someone, anyone really. They were probably chatting with other employees. I'm making assumptions because I was really annoyed at how long people had to hold up this drunk chick with a possible head injury. \n\nAlso parking sucks around here. Why do people suck at driving around this area? It's a Wednesday night. People shouldn't be cruising Old Town looking for chicks on a Wednesday. \n\nThis place has been open for a while. I go to a ton of concerts and this was the first musician whom I've had to see here.... and to be honest, I'm hoping it's the last.
