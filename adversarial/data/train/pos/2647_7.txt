I'm not a Diamond high roller, but I am also not the new Vegas tourist who fell off the turnip truck.  I maintain a higher level of casino play here, to where I get free rooms, free food, and other comps that some people may not get.\n\nAccording to Caesars Entertainment, the people who own Paris,  the hotel Paris is considered more upscale than the other properties ( Flamingo, Ballys, Rio, Quad, Planet Hollywood, Harrahs) with the exception of Caesars Palace...  Yet, the past 2 times I've stayed at this property as a \"comp\" I get treated more shabby than the other properties.  Their front desk people who work the Platinum desk must be the punished ones... they don't get the Diamond \/ 7Stars desk, so they're demoted to help low rollers like me.\n\n3 months ago, when I called to booked my room, I was transferred to a special VIP Marketing Department to take care of my free room.  WIth the 2 nights free room I also received free money to play on the slots.  The person booked me the \"Red Luxury\" room and told me that I'd be getting one of the nicer rooms in the HIGHER floors of the hotel.  He kept gushing how much fun I would be having.  \n\nFast forward to the arrival date.\n\nWhen I arrived to check in,  this older lady who couldn't even smile asked me a string of questions like \"smoking?\" \"King or queen?\" which I replied Non Smoking, King, and a higher room with a view please.  She replied \"Of course\", and then promptly tried to give me the FIFTH floor, smoking.  WTF!?!   \n\n5th floor is only 1 story higher than the ground level.  It wasn't a view of the pool, it was the pool!\n\nI handed her back the key and said I'd like a higher room, please, non smoking, and with a view.  I also asked her if it was a Red Room and she replied \"No, its a request only, and  comp rooms are only by request.  So, you got a classic room\".  \n\nCome on, you couldn't even LOOK to see if I could get a nicer room?  \n\nApparently anything I said, she gave me the opposite.  If I said blue, she'd say green.   I told her that I'd wait for a nicer room, and she said come back at 4.\n\nThe Classic room was \"Just OK\".  It was on the 12th floor (Room 1223) and it did face the Paris ball, overlooking the pool.  The room, however, smelled strongly of cleaning detergent, like they just shampooed it.  For a free room, it did the job.\n\nI get it that I got the room for free, but I didn't like how the front desk treated me, like I don't deserve VIP treatment.  I dump a lot of money at their property (and it shows, since I'm bombarded by free offers every single week!) and yet Paris is the worse hotel when it comes to front desk courtesy.\n\nIn December I was in Flamingo, and they gave me a stunning 24th floor room with a magnificent view.  The rooms were actually nicer than the \"Classic\" Paris room I got, and location on the Strip was just as nice.  Even Ballys once gave me a corner suite, and I didn't even ask to be upgraded.\n\nWhat gives, Paris?? Is recycling $20K not enough?  I guess not.
