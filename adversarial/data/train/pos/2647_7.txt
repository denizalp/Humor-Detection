You always know what to expect with Festival in the Park.  Lots of crowds, many many art vendors, fair food and no parking.  There are performances from local groups and schools too!  If you are lucky it will be a gorgeous sunny day that isn't too hot.\n\nWe took a blanket this year and just people-watched which is always fun here.     Freedom Park is a great place to hang out and watch the doggies sniff each other's butts.  Always a great time but glad it is just once a year!
