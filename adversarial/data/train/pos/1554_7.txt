As my Jeep was approaching 9000km without an oil change I needed to get something done quick quick and as I drove along Lakeshore in south Etobicoke I passed this spot and pulled a quick U-turn figuring I could get my service done on the cheap and fast.\n\nIts the same concept as a Mr. Lube, actually I'm pretty sure that these are just Mr. Lubes with a different colour scheme and logo. It was the exact same service, same pushy sales reps\/mechanics pushing cabin filters\/tranny flushes\/synthetic oils AND the same inflated prices as Mr. Lube.\n\nTherefore Great Canadian Oil Change is Mr. Lube.\n\nThe guy servicing me was super nice, however I had some sinking suspicion that it was the kind of nice someone is right before they screw you over. I'm nervous. You know where they claim to be doing you a favour on the \"down low.\" I dunno, maybe I'm just jaded from past experiences at similar establishments.\n\nIf my car survives to it's next oil change and nothing bad happens, I'd consider giving them an extra star based on the fact that I was in and out in 20 minutes. However, due to pricing, I can't say this is my best option in future.
