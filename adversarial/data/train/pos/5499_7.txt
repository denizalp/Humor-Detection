Definitely not the best location and Inside could benefit from a good deep cleaning. Walking in I often notice a nasty smell and the floors are dirty. I've learned my lesson on buying fruits and veggies here after 2 different times I cut into onions that were rotten inside. The deli is hit or miss when it comes to customer service and the way your lunch meat and cheese gets sliced varies regardless of how you requested it. The ladies in the bakery are the only saving grace this store currently has to offer being courteous, helpful and willing to slice almost any loaf of bread in the bakery you'd like. \n\nI use self-checkout since I mostly only have a couple of items and it's an easy process except for the guy usually working that area, Darren. When it comes to Darren, he's completely unprofessional and always trying to push his personal Facebook page on customers. Once he gave me a hard time over a 5 cent jalapeño when the screen was having an issue thinking I'd not bagged the item and I had, he started saying where other customers could hear that I couldn't leave with out paying the nickel. I told him what was going on and he just kept going on about the nickel I owed. It would have been nice if he'd have lowered his voice and not made it seem to others like I was trying to steal a damn 5 cent jalapeño and did the job he's supposed to by simply giving me some help at checkout. I took a nickel out of my purse and set it down meanwhile grabbing the jalapeño and walked out leaving him to deal with the wonky machine. \n\nThe parking lot gets cramped and the entry\/exits to the lot makes no sense. Make sure to always keep your eyes open no matter what section of the lot you are in because it's not laid out well.
