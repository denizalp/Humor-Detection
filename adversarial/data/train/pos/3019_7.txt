Do you like giant bowls of booze? Are you looking for the real deal Polynesian drinks and not some cruise ship abomination that is more sugar and fake juice than alcohol?  Do you wonder how someone could make a girly drink manly? Have you ever said, \"You know what this drink is missing? Dry ice!\"????  Even if you haven't, just get your butt down to Porco and experience the good life.  This place is pretty much the VTR of the Tiki Bar world.  Who knew that fog cutter or a scoripon bowl could be so damn awesome?!?!  And the zombies! Oh the zombies... they are amazing and you can get them super strong.  This is a place for the manliest of drinkers who can't ever get enough hair on their chest to the foofiest of girl-drink drunks.  I LOVE PORCO!!!
