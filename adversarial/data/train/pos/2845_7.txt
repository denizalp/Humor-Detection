There is a reason this restaurant has a line out the door on the weekends. It's because they have a good breakfast, a decent patio and they are dog friendly! We've eaten breakfast here a couple of times and have been lucky both times to not have to wait for a table. We came one time with our dog Harley and he had a blast! In fact, they have a special menu for dogs. Yes, dogs! We ordered Harley the Pup cakes for dogs which are pancakes and gravy. Harley gobbled it up in about three bites! I enjoyed the omelet which was also tasty but I think Harley enjoyed his meal more. All in all, this is a great breakfast nook and one you should visit!
