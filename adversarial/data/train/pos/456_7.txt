Came here on a Sunday night with friends. They didn't have any small rooms so we're were forced to get the late room. Happy hour is until 9pm. Large rooms are 35 an hour. Not bad if you come with a big group of people. \n\nRooms are large clean and the ac is blasting. Remember to check in for shaved us. And if you're writing a review like I am, they give you free sake. All drinks are buy one get one free. \n\nThis place is decked out for Halloween. They even having moving props!  I can't wait to come herewith a bigger group of friends and sing out hearts out. They have a good menu here and things are decently priced. 10 to 20 bucks.  Free sake by Ian
