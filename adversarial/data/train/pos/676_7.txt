I always say that PT's are Vegas's equivalent of Starbucks on the East Coast - there's one on every corner. This is an older PT's, but it's very nice and clean. The bartenders are friendly and attentive. I like this location as it has a cozy, neighborhood bar feel. And it's never crowded. Otherwise, yeah, it's your standard PT's. It's not all that much different from the one down the block or the other one up the block.
