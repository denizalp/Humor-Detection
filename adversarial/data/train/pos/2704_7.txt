The question is what is better My Pie or Fired Pie? Both have the same concept. Special pies or make your own pie. Walked in to this very little spot. A few two seater tables and friendly staff greeting us. \n\nThey have great options for crust, sauces, cheeses, veggies, and meats. I think I ordered the white crust with marinara sauce, parmesan and mozzarella cheese, mushrooms, black olives, tomatoes, sausage, and pepperoni. Just picked whatever with no rhyme or reason. They put it in that 800 degree oven and BOOM. Lunch is ready. \n\nI thought it was really good. Nice fresh ingredients and a really nice friendly staff. So my question who is better, My Pie or Fired Pie. I think they are the same. They might have a few small differences but nothing that stood out. I think it's a personal preference. To me they are both good and whichever is closer is probably the one I will go to. \n\nSo if your hungry for a quick pie, this is the place to go. No more Pizza Hut, Dominos, Pappa Johns or any of those other pizza places. It's either My Pie or Fired Pie. Yum yum enjoy.
