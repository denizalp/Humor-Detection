First, a disclaimer: I know Tony (the owner) and built his website. But I'm not biased. I was originally a customer and have received the best, most confidence-inspiring service I've ever received at an auto shop. He's taken care of three of my cars over the years, the most recent being a Volvo, which any non-volvo specialist will tell you can be a nightmare. He offers excellent, friendly service at fair prices and within very reasonable timeframes. I've recommended him to many of my friends and colleagues. You absolutely can't go wrong.
