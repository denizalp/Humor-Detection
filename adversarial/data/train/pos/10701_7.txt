Dirty bird? That's absolutely correct. The chicken was pure grossness and the waffle was drenched in maple syrup. I had the ODB and I'm pretty sure they served it with suspicious vegetable mixed with bird poo. I paid $18 and they didn't even provide me with water to wash down the bird poo. If I could I'd give negative nine stars! Atrocious!
