Bonnie screams So not worth it! An hour and a half in the general line even if the tickets purchased ahead of time online! Zombie bus sold out even before the attraction was opened. You wait in line to get tickets and then wait again to get on the bus. Can't review it since we didn't get to go on it to my kids big disappointment!\nThe ghost trail is a joke! 10 minute walk on a dark dusty Not decorated trail. The whole trail had one spider in the bushes and that's it! The haunted train is another joke. On the way we encountered a chainsaw guy once and that's it! Even my 6 year old said: \"That's it?\" Haunted houses are so disappointing! There are only 3 and they are not scary at all. There are just a few actors in there and half of them aren't even dressed up! They jump out at you wearing regular hoodies! Very few shows and characters outside the haunted houses. The food is limited, disgusting, and very expensive. \n\nMy totals were $100 for 4 tickets (no discount for kids), and $45 for 4 cold hamburgers, 3 hot chocolates, and 1 beer. So not worth it! You better off going to Fright Dome!
