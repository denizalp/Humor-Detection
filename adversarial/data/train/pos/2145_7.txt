A solid 3.5 stars for my first visit, if that were an option.  When 5th and Wine dared to close over Memorial weekend, my friend and fellow Yelper, Christina P, suggested CD as an alternative.\n\nTrying to grasp onto those last few days of tolerable temps, we sat outside, and drink orders were taken promptly.  I went with the Camelback Cooler.  I wanted to love it, but it was a miss for me.  I wanted it to be a little sweeter and more \"orangey.\"  Instead, it was on the bitter side.  Cocktail number two was the Clown Punch.  This was the hit for me.  The pomegranate foam on top was unexpected, well not really since it's listed on the menu, and fun!\n\nWe all shared the soft pretzels and provolone fondue.  I could try everything on their menu, and I'm pretty sure that would still be a favorite for me.  But who doesn't love bread and cheese?  I also tried the pork belly cubano, although Christina forewarned me it's really ham, not pork belly.  Maybe that's why the restaurant is called \"Culinary Dropout.\"  Whatever the hell it was, it was really good, too.\n\nAlthough the Scottsdale \"Waterfront\" is not necessarily my favorite place to be, I can see myself enjoying CD every now and then.  I can also see that 4th star with another try.
