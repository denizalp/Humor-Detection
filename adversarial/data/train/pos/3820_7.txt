The worst the worst the worst experience ever in my life with a Pharmacy..I was at the cashier there to pay the meds...which eas free cuz I had medicaid..and I was dangling and dangling my card cuz this insurance was new for me..forget it..tbe clerk said ohh we have tbat isurance on file And I said okay..but No they didnt and she proceeded to tell me $95.00..and I started to explain..but she jumped in and said Medicaid doesnt cover \"everything!\"  So I had to leave limping with severe pain!  I was 7 days like that in great pain..so I started doing a little digging and all my meds \"were\" free..I went back and Ive never told off a clerk like I did that day ever! Turn away from this place..and run for the hills..also their lady Pharmacist is a terrrible terrible person..bitter bad attitude and overworked..she hides constantly behind these shelves right behind tbe cashier..its crazy! Like shes tired of the customers!  Wow
