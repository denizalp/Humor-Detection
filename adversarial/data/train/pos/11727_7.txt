I found Monica through my RE Agent. From start to finish, she was very responsive and helpful. I have to add that she is very knowledgeable. She walked me through the loan process and told me the do's and dont's. When I had burning questions late in the evening, she responded. I thought that was cool! Not sure if any other loan officers do that for you. If I ever had to purchase another home, I would most definitely work with someone with the industry experience that knows exactly what they are doing. Thanks Monica for your assistance with getting me the best rate and your timeliness in all that you did for me.
