A good friend, \"Homeslice,\" told me I had to visit this chain as it was something he had to do before he \"kicked the bucket.\"  Pressure much?  \n\nWhile making a turn looking for a fudge place, I ran into Primanti Brother's.  Looking at the Yelp reviews, I happened to find the original.  It was meant to be = )  \n\nI parked, stepped outside in 37F weather, and a breeze of fried sweetness surrounded me.  Feels\/looks like a pub, 24-hr, cash only spot, and known for their coleslaw and french fry stuffed sandwiches.  You can order as sides but why not try it the way they make it, right?\n\nI ordered the corned beef and cheese - $6.29 (includes tax).  After a bite, I softly said, \"Oh...my...God\"  Yumminess!!\n\n-Corned beef: maybe 5 thin slices with a small layer of swiss cheese.  Juicy but not too much.  Just enough salt.  Covers the entire span of the bread.  You can order double meat for $1.99.  I didn't need.\n-Fries: majorly fried, still soft, and sweetly seasoned.  About a handful is added to the meat and cheese.  Loved the sweet and salty combo.  \n-Coleslaw:  prepared peppery and vinegary (my faves).  Adds tang to my sandwich...me likes much!  I don't like my coleslaw mayoey (sp?) or creamy ; P.  It also adds bite to the sandwich especially since the 1 inch bread is un-toasted, therefore soft.  \n\nThe place is lively with locals.  Staff is friendly and checks in on you while on the go, all the time.  I respect.  \n\nEat there.  I wouldn't recommend ordering To-Go because the weight and moistness of the goodies flattens\/softens the bottom piece of bread quickly.  Even then, the sandwich sits well over 3 inches.  Grub grub grub and enjoy with a sweet tea or a beer.  I'm saving my beer tasting for another place I visited last year.  Review to come soon.\n\nMust go...people are standing at the door waiting for customers to leave.  I can understand their pain; hunger pain that is.
