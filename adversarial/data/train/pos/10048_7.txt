No.\n\nObviously you don't have very high expectations when going to a place like this.. it's basically a glorified bar.. and this location is on the Las Vegas Strip...and to basically mimic what another reviewer said: the service was sloooow - and the food was GROSS. \n\nI ordered a 'chicken fajita burrito'.. which came to he table as a 'BEEF fajita burrito'.. about 35 minutes after it was ordered..AND it had CHILI all over it... like beef chili.. slopped over the top.. along with fake canned cheese.. which I guess would be fine, if that is what I had ordered.. and i was extremely drunk.  It was incorrect.. it looked unappealing.. but hey, I gave it a chance. Sufficed to say, I won't be going back for that particular menu item. (I did mention to the server that it was incorrect... he claimed they sent the wrong one, and I said I would deal with it.. but on the bill, it was listed as BEEF Fajita Burrito..as in.. he ordered the wrong item and lied to me about it.) Mistakes happen.. I get it... I'm just sayin.\n\nThe 2 friends I was with, both decided it was pretty bad service as there were missing utensils, drinks for the 3 of us were coming one at a time.. and there really seemed to be no excuse for the lack in service, because they were not at all busy.   We all agreed that the drinks weren't bad.. and the outdoor patio is a nice attraction to ''people watch' from .. but other than that.. I will not be eating any of their \"signature\" dishes again...ever. They had chicken tenders with fries on the menu, and if I ever visit this spot again to have drinks.. and decide that I am hungry (and very lazy, because there are 10 better choices less than 50 feet away, ) I will be having those. \n\nI don't recommend the food at all. The drinks were good and the Jeremiah Sweet Tea Vodka(?) Drink.. was tasty albeit very  sweet... but I did have 2! Anyway.. that's that.. good luck in your dining adventures!
