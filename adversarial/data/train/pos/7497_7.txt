We decided to try Latin American cuisine on a Saturday night.  After squeezing into our parking space, we entered the restaurant and were greeted warmly by Alejandro, the owner of Sabroso.  Alejandro is the most active restaurant owner I've seen in a long time -- he spends time conversing with customers, serving plates, and playing percussion\/drums with the guitarist\/singer!   Our server Orlando took our orders on his iPod touch and sent it to the kitchen right away.\n\nAppetizers:\nCalamari with avocado\/wasabi mayo with lime:  cute, wonderfully fried calamari sticks with a light batter.  The mayo was a perfect match; I just wish that there was more of it!\n\nPotatoes tortilla: potatoes, onions, cilantro in an omelette.  The vibrant dipping sauce had the right amount of spice.\n\nMains:\nParrilla para Dos:  the grilled hangar steak was juicy and tender, prawn skewer seasoned just right, chorizo, boneless chicken, crispy potatoes.  The sauce was so delicious that I was tempted to lick the plate clean.  It was served with a side plate of risotto, baby bok choy, squash and microgreens -- cooked to perfection.\n\nDesserts:\nMilhojas con Arequipe:  the delicate mille-feuille with caramel sauce and vanilla custard was not too cloyingly sweet.  The custard was as smooth as silk.  Mmmm....\n\nCinnamon Churros:  my son loved his cute little churros coated in cinnamon sugar. It came with a chocolate sauce on the side for dipping.\n\nFig and Cocoa Nib Bread Pudding:  hubby had this one and I took a quick nibble.  The fig and cocoa compliment one another so well that there's no need for extra sugar.  Let the ingredients speak for themselves!\n\nMaravilloso!   We will definitely be back!
