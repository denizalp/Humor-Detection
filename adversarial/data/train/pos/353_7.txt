Ahhh, Flancer's Cafe.  You're filled with cute boys who serve me.  You offer a bunch of tasty sandwiches that become two meals for me because they are so large.  And apparently, you have amazing pizza.  Hurrah.\nI tried the \"No Bones About it\" (All the food has cute names!) sandwich, which is Boneless Buffalo Chicken with lettuce, tomato, onion, and cheddar.  It comes on amazing bread.  The kind that is slightly crisp on the outside and delightfully soft on the inside, but with substance.  None of that wonderbread crap.  It's a huge sandwich - which is about $7.50 if I'm remembering correctly.  They'll turn the sandwich into a \"meal combo\" for four additional dollars, which would include a fountain drink and a side like fries or soup or potato salad.  However, I recommend sharing a large fry with a friend if you go, because that's only like $2.50 or something.  (I tend to just drink water so it would make my bill cheaper....I dunno about yours haha).  The staff is prompt, friendly and funny.  A nice little place down the street from my parents house =)
