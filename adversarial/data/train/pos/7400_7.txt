There is a really large selection of different plants and trees. Half of them aren't labeled or priced. So unless you know exactly what you're looking for you may need to grab a worker... if you can find one. Aside from the cashier the only worker I saw was in the parking lot. I enjoyed walking around and looking at the wide variety of plants but I couldn't help but notice that every nook and cranny was stuffed with random crap. Every turn had revealed more gardening tools and materials, it looked junkie. I went to Whitfill for flowers which I usually buy at Home Depot but I wanted nursery quality, if there is such a thing. The same flowers were 4 times the price than Home Depot. I decided I wasn't willing to pay nursery prices and left empty handed.
