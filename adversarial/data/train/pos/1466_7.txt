I would not want to be anywhere else in the world. Great prices, great layouts, great pool, great gym, and great neighbors. If that wasn't enough, the girls that work in the front office are soo good to me, very helpful, diligent, thorough, and they also just happen to be bangin'!!! What I would give for a night with the St. Clair twins. I know there can only be 1 \"Babe of the Year\" but these two tie for first place for 2012 and beyond. They always have fresh baked cookies and two beautiful smiles to help wash them down. They even got jokes! I have lived in a lot of places, but St. Clair is by far the best and most pleasant. If I am lucky, I might get to die here : ) I highly recommend, happy hunting.
