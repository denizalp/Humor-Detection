I was highly recommend to have Raul do my hair. I was told he's the \"master\" at doing hair. I've had Raul cut my hair a couple times  & I've always been happy with his work, until now. I had Raul color my hair--one color. Within 4 days my color has completely faded & Raul also fried my bangs. The first night of after getting my hair done my scalp burned. I text Raul & told him my color had completely & that I'm not happy with my hair. Raul then tells me he can add more color but I need to see his doctor for Xanax. Raul tells me that I have anxiety & panic disorder. ARE YOU KIDDING ME?! I spent $175 which is A LOT for me. I trusted him to color & cut my hair & this is what I get?! NEVER AGAIN will I go to Raul. I HIGHLY recommend NO ONE TO EVER GO TO RAUL AT ENVOGUE!\nI'm going to post a screen shot of the rude text Raul sent me.
