Commonplace Poluto. What is this? Some kind of slam directed at Commonplace coffee saying that they are polluting the environment? Or are they just fan of Pluto? Oh it's a V not a P. Commonplace Voluto. What is That supposed to mean then? Is it some secret message to tell you how convoluted their coffee making is? \n\nActually I haven't found them to be the slamming type, nor have I noticed that they were astronauts. And the coffee is no more complicated than any other place that makes good coffee. It is quality, that I know. I once ran through a terrible Steel City blizzard risking my life to get to this place. Why would I do such a thing? Because I knew if I survived I would survive With a delicious pour-over. I survived. With a delicious pour-over. \n\nThe design in here stands out a bit in the Pittsburgh specialty coffee scene. It's far more modern than anywhere else. It's refreshing to see something new. As far as the coffee, it's on par with most of the other coffee shops around. Obviously they use Commonplace beans. And they brew it on their Synesso or in a pour-over. Not a whole lot more can be said. If you looked it up in Kent K's encyclopedia of Pittsburgh coffee, it would say, \"Beautiful, modern cafe with quality coffee.\"
