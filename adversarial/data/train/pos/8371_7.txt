la paryse is a small place where there are several tables and there is almost always a short wait to get in.  seated at the counter, i opened the menu and after a brief scan my eyes gravitated towards the strangest sounding combination on the menu:  le special, a hamburger with cream cheese.  i had to try it.\n\nit turned out to be one of my top five burger experiences, and my favorite burger in montreal thus far.  they didn't ask me how i would like it cooked and it was served medium, which was just right.  the cream cheese serves a couple of purposes.  spread on the insides of each half of the bun, it anchors down the thinly sliced mushrooms and onions on the bottom, keeping them from sliding out as you bite into the burger.  it also gets a little bit melty on the bottom side, and the melting cream cheese intermingled with those onions, mushrooms, and burger is out of this world.  one the top, it doesn't melt, and holds down an impossibly thin slice of tomato.  the other purpose served is taste\/texture.  cream cheese is one of the last things i would have thought of to put on a burger but i'm so glad la paryse did!   ketchup would have only  been an insult to this perfect combination, so the nearby bottle stayed far away from my burger.\n\nthe fries were similar to the disco fries i grew up on in new jersey diners except they were much, much better here.  the mozzarella was extremely fresh and the gravy must have been made in house, as it was truly something special.  sorry montreal, but if i were forced to make a choice between only being able to have la paryse's fries or poutine, i'd choose la paryse.  \n\nthe people here really hustle to make sure that people get seated as quickly as possible and that they're served quickly as well.  \n\nthe last great thing about this place is it's right next door to distillerie, so you're good to go with post meal drinks.
