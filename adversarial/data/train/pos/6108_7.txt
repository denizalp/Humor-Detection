I don't think people understand that this Yelp page is for PRESTO and not THE TTC! People are hating on this page blaming the TTC for not having the Presto machines available at all stations and buses (which they do 100% now), but that's not Presto's fault, that's the TCC's!! \n\nPresto is a great and easy transit card that lets you reload money either in person or online, and lets you travel to just about anywhere in the GTA. It's accepted on the YRT, Viva, GO, Mississauga + Brampton Transit as well as the TTC. \n\nI highly recommend setting up Auto Load on your card as you never have to worry about not having funds OR have to lineup in person to refill funds on your card. If you're taking the same route daily, you should also set up a DefaultTrip! All you have to do is tap on and don't have to worry about tapping off. Talk to a customer service rep to get that set up, it's easy and makes your life easier. \n\nStop hating on Presto people.
