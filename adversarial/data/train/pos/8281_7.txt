I've been a fan of this place for years. Over the weekend, I took a group of friends for some hangover food. They were very skeptical when they saw the decor. One friend actually said, \"worst decision ever.\"\n\nAlways remember kids: never doubt the 100 pound girl that eats like a 300 pound man. Write that down.\n\nHouse of Pizza is not the fanciest of places. I'm pretty sure that if we could go back in time that everything would still look exactly the same. Probably reminds you a lot of a pizza and sub place from your childhood.\n\nI'm a big fan of their subs. I bounce back and forth between the Philly and the turkey. They even have one simply called \"bacon.\" Warning: my friend had to take a bacon induced nap after wards. Although, I still think that may have had to do with the fact that he also consumed a dozen wings.\n\nGreat prices on the menu. They also run a daily spaghetti special. The salads are good sized. Very old school. For the Greek, they bring the bottle of dressing right to the table. The pizza is pretty good as well.\n\nThe staff is friendly. It feels warm and inviting when you walk into the restaurant. The service is okay. Some days slower than others... but nothing to complain about.\n\nMy friends offered up an apology to me after our adventure here. They are new fans... and will definitely be going back.
