My experience was completely different to the previous Yelper's. I was looking for a laptop and had pretty much decided on Best Buy. After doing online research, I took one last venture down MacLeod Tr and decided to drop into every shop from Anderson to Chinook. Asides from slight hope at Laptop Depot, the venture was a complete waste of gas. That is until I hit the final stop before begrudgingly heading back to Best Buy. \n\nI walked in 5 minutes before close and was treated very friendly. Not only was the clerk knowledgable, but he was willing to deal which almost none of the other places was willing to do. I have a decent laptop as well as Microsoft Office for $1000 flat. Admittedly it's only been a couple of days, I am extremely pleased with my purchase. If anything changes, I'll make sure to update my review lol.
