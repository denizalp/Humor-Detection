Soooo many good things it hurt!!! \n\nI generally don't like buffets at all. They are always about \"quantity\"... Huge selection of below average tasteless cold greasy food. Bachannel has QUANTITY (as in variety) and QUALITY.  \n\nSeriously - there are several dishes at this buffet which are so good that it's impossible to not have a second helping. A few of these items are: \n\nUdon - super flavorful broth. \nCrab legs - perfectly chilled w\/ lemon & butter.\nRaclette cheese - paired w\/ multigrain bread.\nPoke - fresh, citrusy, and spicy.\nPizza - crispy crust and a zesty sauce.\nKobe beef sliders - not overly cooked. \nCrepes - Made to order. Nutella goodness.\n\nI've had this buffet 5 times now and I still haven't been able to taste everything. They have large sections containing a variety of dishes for whatever you maybe in the mood for:\nSeafood section - cold and hot\nCarved meat section\nItalian \nMexican \nChinese \nTraditional American \nCheeses and breads \nSalad bar \nSoups \/ noodles \nSushi - only section I'm not impressed with \n\nDeserts - their selection is huge along with a made to order crepe station and a gelato station. If they had chocolate covered strawberries, it would be desert heaven!
