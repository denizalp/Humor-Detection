I came here to see \"Miracle on 34th Street\" with my Mom, son and my mom's friends. Wasn't sure what to expect since I've never been here. We came on a Sunday night and they open the theatre doors at 5:30 for dinner. \n\nDinner was a buffet. One line was for hot food. One for salad bar and one line for deserts. The hot food had mixed vegetables, cream string beans, mash potatoes and gravy, shredded Turkey in a gravy, thinly cut ham, and thinly cut prime rib. The salad bar was a normal salad bar with limited topping and a few salad dressing. The desert bar had lots of pies and different bars. I would say the ham and prime rib were dry and would recommend that you put some gravy on top. Otherwise, I would say the food is okay. Not a real favorite of mine. I would put this in the same category as Home Town Buffet which is not a compliment in my book. \n\nSo they gave us two hours to eat which means the show didn't start til 7:30pm. They had a pre-act with a bunch of singing and dancing which was good. I really liked the show. Nice big stage. Really good acting. Enjoyed the show. First act lasted about an hour and the second act about a half an hour. So ended a little after 9pm. \n\nNow would I come back. That's the million dollar question. Didn't like the food so I would probably eat something before I came again but really enjoyed the show. I guess I would come back if there was a show I was really wanted to see. The reason for the 3 star is I didn't like the food and for a Foodie like me. It's important. I would give the show a definite 4 star. So enjoy.
