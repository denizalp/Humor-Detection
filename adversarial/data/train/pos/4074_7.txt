Small town....small space....now for a lot of places this would be a bad thing, but great things can come in small packages....I should know.\n\nSitting among the little shops and coffee shops and ice cream parlors sits Toast.  The name is as cool as the place\/food\/servers.\n\nCan it get packed on the weekend...yes, but just go early and miss the crowds.  If you go in the summer, the Farmers Market happens just down the street and makes for a perfect Saturday morning.\n\neggs are great, the pancakes better, and the coffee always hot and tasty.
