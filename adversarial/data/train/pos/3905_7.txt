My daughter won tickets to this event and I was not that excited about it but was up for trying anything. I really enjoyed it! The weather was perfect, there was something for everyone, and I actually learned a lot about beer! Some of my favorites were Four Peaks and San Tan. While I couldn't possibly use all the tickets and still walk straight, I was glad that they had wash stations so the ones I didn't like to much I could wash on out and try another. This was a fun event, learned a lot, and actually found beers that I would enjoy in the future. Well laid out and the lines were not to long which means they didn't oversell the event which I hate when they do! Did I mention how beautiful it was to be outside that day!
