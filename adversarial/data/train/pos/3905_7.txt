Call me trendy, call me stale.... I've spent too long on your trail. Far too long, chasing your trail. (Of hot fudge.)\n\nAnd if you have some ice cream to share, then I'll tell you the story of my life..... sixteen, chubby, and why? I want ice cream all the time. \n\nI went to Sweet Moses and died. \n\nI plopped my ass down in a booth. I-C-E.... cream. I said, I like it here, can I stay? I like it here, can I stay? and do you have a vacancy for an ice cream taster?\n\n(#200!)
