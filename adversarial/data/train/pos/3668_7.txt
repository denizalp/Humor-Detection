I walked out of Maggie's.\n\nTwo things can cause me to walk out of a restaurant: No vegetarian options, or maggots* in my food. Maggie's has plenty of vegetarian options.\n\n*I'll append my comments to note that I only saw one maggot on my potato frittata, alive and writhing. One leads me to the presumption of more.
