I had a lot of fun riding the Segway through Fremont and downtown Las Vegas! This may not have been the most exciting tour but the people-watching and the cruising was really nice. Chuck was also very nice as my guide. I'm definitely gonna try some of the other tours.\nIf you're a local, the price is half!
