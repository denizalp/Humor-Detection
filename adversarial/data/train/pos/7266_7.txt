If it wasn't for the people whom are gambling there foreclosure\/rent money in the casino, I think this casino would be closed down(Recently Station Casino Sold this casino for a reason)...The senior citizen community \"Sun City\" is so close to this casino it my's well be attached as there homes and banks, and individuals  cashing social security checks...Just when you thought Sun City Aliante was flat broke somehow they keep coming lured by food (buffets) which isn't bad...The movie theaters are nice, dealers in the casino have major attitudes (no tips in this casino)...\n\nKeep the casinos on the strip where they belong! Put a park there instead. (Even a senior event center!)
