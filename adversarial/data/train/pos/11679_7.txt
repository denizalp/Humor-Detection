3.5 Stars!\n\nUYE with Adam and Julia!! I've had this place in my bookmarks for a while but it's a bit out of my way so never thought I'd go. \n\nI ordered the regular poutine and was a bit disappointed there was so little cheese but the appeal of this place is to get their speciality poutines. Adam got the bs which is bason sausage and it was delicious. \n\nThey have lots of seating but not in a organized ways. They're mostly tables for groups. I also found that since the seating was only stools, it was uncomfortable. \n\nBut even then the place is great! A really great neighbourhood joint. I think it's great for takeouts or group hangouts at lunch.
