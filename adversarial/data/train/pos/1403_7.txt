Thank you Sports Chalet for the Military Discount!  I love coming here since they have lots of swimming gear for the kiddos. A nice size store with friendly service.  Nice women's casual clothes too!  You can even learn to scuba here. Lots to see at this store-running shoes, tons of camping gear, bikes, paddle boards, and almost everything else you can think of.\n\nLocated next to Whole Foods.
