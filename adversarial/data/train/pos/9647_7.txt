I could not believe my student budgeted eyes when I walked into Essence! I am very new to Toronto and live right by Chinatown. I had almost given up on eating organically and it seemed as though the Lucky Moose was about to have one more loyal patron. But then, one day by mistake, it happened. I turned west and saw the beautiful word \"Organic\" scribbled above a small storefront. I ran in and Oh Em Gee...it was meant to be. \n\nOk enough of the sappy stuff... Essence is a bit squishy but I'm not complaining. If their place were any bigger it would be the customers fronting the rent. So let's all just do the shuffle and get along! \n\nPrices are great. For example, organic eggs are $4.99\/doz., grain fed eggs are $3.99\/doz. I litre of organic milk is $2.89. They don't sell two litre cartons though, so be warned! Organic yogurt is about $4.70 or so. Their bulk peanut butter is $1.99\/lb. Organic potatoes, onions and tomatoes are also $1.99\/lb. Peppers are $4.99\/lb (green) and $5.99\/lb (red and yellow). I think you get the point. They carry absolutely everything you would ever need in your home! The only thing they lack is a proper meat section - but there is always the Healthy Butcher for that!\n\nOh and they have kiwi fruits for very very cheap!!!  ...In case you were wondering...
