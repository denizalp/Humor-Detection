Unethical drivers. Had to call for a cab from panorama hills in Calgary which is close to the airport. The guy who picked me up basically took me on a scenic ride even when I told him I wanted the shortest distance. Cab fare came to $40 on what should have been a $25 fare. Called dispatch and they don't care. Don't use this company unless you want to get screwed.\nDriver 2788 you got a little bit extra this fare but I (along with my friends and family) will never use Associated Cab in the future.
