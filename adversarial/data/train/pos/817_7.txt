Without a doubt, this is the best Indian restaurant in the 'Burgh. I haven't had a buffet this overflowing with vegetarian options since my days trolling Devon Ave. in Chicago for samosas. The food is artfully and thoughtfully prepared, with spice levels that changed from dish to dish, and truly interesting flavor combinations. I was blown away. I can't remember the last time I ate at an Indian buffet where the choices were so many that I couldn't sample everything. You actually need a game plan when dining here. They offered the mini masala dosa with sambar and coconut chutney on my visit. While the mini dosas aren't as crispy as the larger ones I've had (probably because they make them ahead of time) these were still delicious, and the sambar was excellent. Everything was excellent, from the veg pakora, which were perfectly fried and delicious, to the dal, which was rich and creamy, to the fresh broccoli and potatoes, the eggplant masala, the saag paneer...I could go on, but you get the drift. They had 3 dessert choices too. Over the top. The best part is, if you can't get to the lunch buffet, they serve up a dinner buffet on Thursday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday nights. I can't wait to go back.
