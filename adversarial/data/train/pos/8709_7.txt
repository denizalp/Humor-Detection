One of my best friends is gay so I've been to many a gay bar and club in New York, San Francisco, LA, San Diego, etc. I always enjoy my experiences because I personally find the music to be incredibly fun, the drinks strong, and the atmosphere to be more relaxed.\n\nThis was my first time at a Phoenix gay bar so I was excited to see what it was like. It's located in a strip mall in Old Town, which was a little surprising. I paid $5 cover and $6 for 2-4-1 Vodka Cranberries. You buy one drink and then you get a token to use later on that night. The drinks were strong and cheap - my favorite combo.\n\nOverall, a lot of fun dance music and some hip hop, three go go dancers, and a small-medium dance floor and a \"patio\" outside. It was a fun time and I would likely return.\n\nThere was only one issue:\n\nBEWARE!\nI didn't find out about this until after we had left, but my friend charged the drink ($6) she bought on her credit card. She was told there was a $2 service charge. When she got home, she saw that she had been charged a total of $10. Since she said she did not tip - which I personally do not agree with - she didn't understand where the extra $2 charge came from. Now, I personally always tip when I buy drinks, even when it's 2-4-1 night and the second drink is technically free - I still tip on both drinks. However, I still don't think it was right for the bartender to tip himself, because that is technically committing fraud. Incredibly wrong and illegal. I am so glad I did not use my credit card and I would NEVER use my card here after that incident.
