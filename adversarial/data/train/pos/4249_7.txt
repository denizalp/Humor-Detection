On a recent trip to Loss Wages, I decided to see what the hype was about Gordon Ramsey's Steak. \nMy dog Steve was on a winning streak playing Baccarat at Caesar's so a companion and I ventured across the street to Steak located in Paris' casino. Not having reservations, our only choice was to eat in the bar\/lounge area. The table was nice and the chairs were comfy, the only complaint I had was the music was very loud and very thumpy. \nI ordered the Bone in ribeye and she ordered the petite filet we shared the bourbon creamed corn and the mashed potatoes. \nMy steak was ordered medium rare plus, but came out closer to rare, which was ok but not as I would expect in a high end establishment. I was afraid to send it back fearing I would hear \"Bloody 'ell you f'ing donkey\"  so I ate it anyway. The lady's steak was dare I say ordered well done so I cannot comment on it although she enjoyed it. \nThe creamed corn had good flavor but a bit too sweet for me, the potatoes were mediocre at best and both sides had an off putting consistency of baby food. \nOverall it was about a three star rating but no where near a stellar 5 stars I was hoping I would give it. \nIn comparison for the locals in Cincinnati, any of Jeff Ruby Steakhouse's (Especially The Precinct)  would put the angry Brit to shame.
