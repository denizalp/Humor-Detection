The breakfast is definitely yum but, not exceptional. I'm not sure if it was worth the 30+ minutes wait. However, service was really good: fast and pleasant. Our server came to check on us multiple times, she also brought my OJ refill without me asking. \n\nI got the pancake special which includes 2 pancakes, 2 eggs and a side of bacon or sausage. I got the raspberry chocolate chip pancakes which were good but just a little too sweet for my palate. Next time, I would try their banana and pecan waffle which looks good. \n\nThe freshly squeezed Orange juice which comes with a free refill is totally worth it. It does have some pulp which I don't mind but I'm sure you could ask them to strain it if desired. \n\nI would definitely return but probably go earlier so I am not waiting for that long. So far there's only one breakfast place in the Phx\/Scottsdale area I would wait for up to an hour for breakfast.
