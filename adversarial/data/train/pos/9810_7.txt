This review was for the showing on December 5 in Honolulu, and all I could think of was: Estrogen, estrogen EVERYWHERE, but in a good way ;) The guys of course, were definitely in shape and knew how to work it on stage. I definitely had my favorite one out of the bunch! I definitely wanted to get memorabilia before I left, but I couldn't -____- I definitely would have loved a free calendar with all the guys autographs for a belated birthday gift. Lol. Can't wait to go back to Vegas for round 2, especially to see my favorite ;)\n\nPROS:\n- The men of course! ;) \n- The MC, Dylan was especially hilarious! That definitely contributed to the show.\n\n\nCONS:\n- Drunk women.
