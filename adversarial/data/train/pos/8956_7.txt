Oh my! Where to start. I really screwed up. I bought a cake from Patti's for a event the next day. And then I did the dumbest thing ever I left it in the car overnight. Early in the morning some vandals broke into my car and took off with the cake! They didn't make it very far though, as anyone would never expect a cake to hold up over night in a car. What was I to do? We moved the party to the alley where we found what remained of the cake, and are watching this great Steeler game while dipping Graham crackers into what's left of the cake! We love all of Patti's great baked goods, and just couldn't imagine letting this delicious cake go to waste! Now as long as I don't burn the steaks, it will end up being a fantastic day!
