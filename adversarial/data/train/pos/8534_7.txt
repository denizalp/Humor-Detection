This supermarket has gone way down hill since last year's renovations.\nThe shelves are not stocked. The expiration dates are part due or not readable.\nThe fish department people are not knowledgeable and are rude.\nThe deli department are extremely slow.\nIt is a shame, six years ago when I first moved here from NY I thought Smiths beat any NY supermarket, now I will need to drive a little further and shop elsewhere.
