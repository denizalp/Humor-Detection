This place is a gem- it's a bit pricey for single admission, so spring for the membership ($25 for an individual) and come back frequently, there's too much to see and do in one visit anyway, and they have a lot of great events throughout the year.\n\nGreat place for kids- several exhibits both indoors and out, interactive stuff and museum displays, not including the seasonal fun stuff over the summer and for Halloween. If you have a toddler in particular, there are regular weekday events for that age group.\n\nTwo museums on site- both worth exploring, both with regular and featured (changing) exhibits. Admission to the museums is included with your admission to the park itself, and they each have a small gift shop.\n\nThe trails. This is the highlight for me. Dessert setting with gravel and paved trails, never too busy, particularly once you're out of sight of the main starting area and the train station- that's right, you can ride a train here too! You can also rent bikes for a low fee to explore instead of hiking.\n\nAdd to the above that there's space for events and weddings, a healthy caf√© on site, and even an interactive presentation with exotic parrots, and you have more than enough justification for the membership pricing and several reasons to come back frequently.\n\nMy only problems with this place are the short hours: 10AM-6PM, daily. Would love if they opened up earlier and stayed open later, or even had extended seasonal hours. Also, heads up that the parking lot is small and fills up fast on beautiful days.
