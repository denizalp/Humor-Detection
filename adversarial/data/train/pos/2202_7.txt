Diminutive deli serving the local lunch crowd. Daily specials are posted on a sandwich board and offer variety to a mind boggling degree. The diverse menu includes sandwiches, wraps, curries, chili, pub fare, and pastas. Pretty decent selections and they accept debit. Not a lot of room to sit, with a few seats inside and a single table outside in the summer. Better for take out.\n\nObligatory Title Pun: Go to TOWNE in this deli!\n\nMenu Readability: Sandwich board features misspellings aplenty, but it gets the point across.\n\nNeed to mention: Do not get the Mexican meat pie under any circumstances.\n\nWhat this place teaches me about myself: Just because you can't spell, doesn't mean you can't make a mean avocado chicken wrap.
