We had a wonderful experience with Jason and his team. Not only did they go above and beyond, by locating our impossible to find flooring, but they went ahead and got us the remaining lot. The coordination was wonderful, including all of the materials, and labor. we used them to add additional wood flooring, and order and install stacked stone brick in our living room. Turned out beautifully. Everyone in the showroom was quite helpful, and we quickly became \"family\".
