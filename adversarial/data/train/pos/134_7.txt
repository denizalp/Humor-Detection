#200 =)\n\nI'm making this my 200th review so all you skeptics who ever doubted that there was anything beyond purses, shoes, and makeup can remember this.  Suckas!  \n\nSo...I'm pretty active.  By that, I mean the gym is my second home, P90x is my backup when I miss spin class\/gym, and I could probably do more pushups than you.  This hike\/climb on Echo Trail kicked my butt!  But, i would say so more on the maneuver part than the physical part and picking the right rocks to climb.  Don't get me wrong, I was pretty damn sore for a couple of days, but not anymore than I would be had I done a bunch of leg squats after taking a break from it.\n\nJust some afterthoughts:\n\n-If you're clumsy, mentally prepare yourself for this because I guarantee you you will trip several times\n\n-If you're scared of heights, really reconsider this because there will be a point of no return.  If you do end up going, just persevere and remember it's all in your head.\n\n-Much like snowboarding, you eat sh*t the minute you get lazy and try to skip steps.  On the way down, don't be careless and try to get more yardage just to get through it quicker.  Each step has to have purpose.\n\n-Bring a couple of PB sandwiches and 2 bottles of water.  It goes a long way \n\n-Bring true hiking shoes and not your pink chucks!  It'll get slippery in many parts.\n\n-If this your first time and you're with a big group, give yourselves 3 hours because you're going to rest a lot and\/or take pictures since there's so many pretty spots.\n\n-We parked at the Monetluca resort or something rather which was about 1 mile away.\n\nAltogether, you're going to have fun...lots of fun.  But even if it's only 1.2 miles each way, it will be challenging as 80% of the hike is actually climbing.  Book reservations for hearty food afterwards and maybe even a spa treatment, and it will be a perfect conclusion to your day.
