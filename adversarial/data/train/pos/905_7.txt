Making it a seasonal tradition to sit down at Carson Kitchen and taste the new menu it was alongside three others that a hot and humid - relatively speaking - night saw the Restaurant half-full, Scott Simon in the kitchen and Matthew Harwell watching over servers that seem to change frequently but never miss a beat.\n\nStill the best reason to be eating downtown even as competition has mounted, Kerry Simon's dream as executed and carried on by Cory Harwell never shy to try new things and challenge diners with big flavors or new ingredients, Summer 2018 sees some twelve new plates join classics such as Chicken Skins, Bacon Jam and other ideas since copped by others elsewhere, the bar program also introducing four new Cocktails from which both the creamy Machu Peach-U and cumbersomely-named but equally complicated \"Imagining Beaches in Bigfork, MT\" warrant attention.\n\nPerhaps the biggest wholesale menu change in years, the Trout Rillettes of Spring giving way to a jar of chunky Cheese topped in Peppers that is good but not on par with what The Goodwich is doing by way of their Baa-mento in terms of creaminess or Crackers, it was in follow-up that \"Pork Wings\" impressed thanks to crisp cubes that visually look laminated by fat and taste great without being overwhelmingly hot.\n\nAlways impressing with Produce, the \"gastro-pub\" feel of a place with exposed ceilings and cement floors making this fact all the more noteworthy, it would be difficult to suggest one new Salad over the other if forced to decide between refreshing Plums & Pecorino or Peach Panzenella though the later certainly eats more hearty thanks to housemade Croutons, a personal distaste for Mint unfortunately making Black Kale & Watermelon a distant third place though no one else at the table seemed to enjoy chewing and chewing and chewing to be rewarded by a rare piece of Fruit or Nut either.\n\nChanging up both Flatbreads for the Summer, the \"Everything\" idea spreading across the nation from Donuts to Choux to Metro Pizza's off-menu Instagram favorite making Carson Kitchen's enjoyable but less unique, those looking for something truly special would be better off ordering six crisp slices of Mushroom Tikka Masala punched up by Tomatoes marinated with fire, another spicy Veg-friendly dish featuring Snap Peas served like Edamame also recommendable.\n\nRare to pass up the aforementioned Chicken Skins when dining as a group, a still-iconic dish at any time during the feast, fans of Chicken who've somehow had enough of Cory's Secret Sunday Sandwich should be thrilled to see boneless Thighs brought back with Alabama-style Sauce, each bite developing in waves with a creamy Citrus finish while the Upstate New York icon of Lamb Spiedies unfortunately sees Protein buried and indistinguishable beneath too many of Chicago's famous pickled Vegetables.\n\nRounding out savories with \"Red Radish,\" another smart Farm & Garden dish that follows the semi-sweet line of thinking from Winter's Caramel Creamed Corn, it was once again that Dinner at Carson Kitchen had to end with the best Brownie in Sin City, but not before also enjoying the fresh and fruity Peach Upside-Down Cake that eats far lighter than most might imagine.\n\n****1\/2:  Taking on immense flavors and reinterpreting some classic dishes Summer at Carson Kitchen falls a bit short at times by being too aggressive, though as usual the vast majority of plates both new and old set a high standard while service and setting are hip yet comfortable...save for those backless metal stools.
