still my favorite chinese food joint in vegas.\ni thought i'd give y'all an idea of what a taiwanese girl eats at a chiu chao style restaurant.\nready?\n\ngolden fried chinese bun - $3.95 - a childhood favorite, and clearly still a favorite in my old age.\n\ngrilled chicken wings - $4.95 - hubby's favorite. to this day, he swears they're the best wings he's had in a long time.\n\nsalt and pepper calamari - $6.95 - pretty light for a fried dish.  delicious.\n\nseafood noodle soup - at $6.95, you can't beat it.  you get a giant bowl of piping hot homemade broth filled with fresh seafood and noodles and, yes, i'd much rather have this over crappy monta ramen anyday!  you even get to choose the style of noodle you'd like - egg, chow fun or mi fun.\n\npan fried rice cake w\/ soy sauce and egg - $6.25 - yum!\n\nseafood and salty fish w\/ dry scallop fried rice - $9.95 - you get a huge plate of fried rice that isn't even the slightest bit oily.  it's filled with delicious cuts of fish, squid and shrimp.  but the best part is the salty fish pieces mixed in.  just gives it the perfect kick.  my favorite!\n\nfried fish filet w\/ thai spicy sauce - $7.95 - a favorite of the in-laws. it's pretty darn good.\n\nstir fried needle noodles and shrimp w\/ xo sauce - $7.95 - k, so anything cooked with xo sauce is the bomb at wendy's.  i don't what type of xo sauce they use or if they make their own in house but, either way, it's damn good!\n\nseafood chow fun - $7.95 - just like beef chow fun but with seafood.  you can also get it stir fried with xo sauce.  that's the bomb too.\n\nhouse chow mein - $7.95 - the absolute best chow mein i've ever had.\n\nspicy steak cubes and rice cake with ramen - $8.99 - sounds odd but tastes really good.  a hubby fave.\n\nma po steamed egg custard - $7.99 - just like mom used to make only with an addition of ma po on top.  what could be better?\n\nchao zhou style live tilapia hot pot - mp but usually costs around $15 - totally worth it.  the fish is always fresh and the hot pot is always piping hot.  it does take some work being that the fish comes whole but, man, is it worth it!\n\nchao zhou style steamed live tilapia - mp again usually $15 - a nice big piece of fish that's steamed to perfection and served with a light sauce, scallions and ginger.  total chinese style.\n\nfish filet stir fried with xo sauce - $9.99 - xo sauce and fish.  what else do i need to say?\n\ni can't remember the prices on the following but know that everything is under $10.....\n\nsteamed fish filet with tofu - simply served with a nice sauce, scallions and ginger. delicious.\n\nlobster vermicelli in xo sauce - yep, again with the xo sauce.  bomb diggity!\n\ngreen beans in xo sauce\n\nsauteed mini bok choy\n\nsauteed taiwanese lettuce (aka a-tsai) - i don't even think this is on the menu but they'll make it if you ask for it.\n\npopcorn chicken\n\nsalt n pepper fish filet\n\nshredded potato appetizer - another one mom used to make. makes me feel like a kid again.\n\nshaved ice\n\nanother thing you should know is that wendy makes all of the pastries herself.\nwe usually gorge ourselves on the food so we have only tried a few pastries that she'd been testing and they were damn good so i can only assume that the rest are equally good.\n\ni can't emphasize enough how inexpensive the food is at $10 or less over 80% of the menu.\neven at those prices, the quality doesn't suffer.\nwendy still busts out with quality ingredients and flavors that most other restaurants need MSG to produce.\nplus, she's always there with a smile on her face and a grateful, welcoming demeanor.\n\nnothing but love for wendy's...
