If it wasn't for bf's and I indecisiveness about what to eat for dinner, \nI wouldn't have had the opportunity to say this now..haha\n\nWe were trying to decide whether we should do sushi or italian? Then the next thing we thought is the prices were too high for a roll of sushi! which then brings us to think about all-you-can-eat, since he'd rather pay more to get more! theeen it came to a decision for Tofu Hut because he's been here many times and loooves this place! And its my first time! \n\nThe highlight: ALL-YOU-CAN-EAT BBQ!!! (nom nom nom!)\nThe price: $16.99 per person (not bad)\nThe list of meats we picked: \n- Short Ribs (my fave..so juicy and mouthwatering)\n- Brisket (my 2nd fave! Thin sliced and flavorful)\n- Boneless chicken thigh (good, a lil spicy)\n- Short Ribeye (good, tender, but kinda salty)\n- Pork Belly (taste like bacon)\nThe Sides included:\n- Cucumber\n- Tofu \n- Kimchee\n- (korean radishes)\n- a big bowl of salad \n\nThis place is \"COOK YOUR OWN SHIT!\" Lol. \nSo definitely it would be a cool place to eat at with friends, family, and especially A DATE! haha. that way everyone can all help out together cooking, crackn laughs, and just having a good time! \n\nFYI***\n*sniffs*  the smell from the food will be stuck to your clothes. blah!
