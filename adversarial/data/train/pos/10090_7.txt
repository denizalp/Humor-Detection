A friend and I came for the soft opening. We were greeted by friendly hostess. We were a bit early for the reservation, but quickly seated. We chose to sit outside and enjoy the still cool May evening. Unfortunately, we were seated on the orange chairs vs the robin's egg blue ones. They sit too low to eat comfortably. They might be good for having a beer on the patio, but for eating they're about 4 inches too low for the table. I'm also am thinking that they're going to need some more umbrellas for the Arizona sun. Chicago doesn't have 325 sunny days a year so it doesn't look like they're prepared for the shade that Arizonans enjoy. However does have a couple nice misters that'll make up for it. Place is beautiful. They have take out frozen pizzas which I'll definitely put the use. I wonder when they'll get into the supermarkets. Staff has been incredibly friendly as this is their first day of being open and looking forward to a pizza I've missed since moving here and only been able to get close to with our local Oregano's. The Coors Light beer was flat and I am surprised they do not offer a few more Chicago beers on the menu. I will be back and I hope I can improve my experience as their experience increases.
