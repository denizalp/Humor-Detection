Watch your step as you walk in the door, turn right and enter the aquarium room. There is nearly a 1' drop, I nearly tripped toward\/onto the aquariums as we came in from the bright sun and didn't see any warnings about that doozy of a first step.\n\nThe shop is saltwater exclusive, seems to have a pretty wide selection of corals, a decent selection of sea life. It almost seemed like they had more variations of crabs and sea stars than fish. However, for a store that seems to be just starting out in the area, it is not as bare as it could have been.
