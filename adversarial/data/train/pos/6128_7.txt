The Pizzeria Bianco Date Night:\n\nIf you're gonna show up at Pizzeria Bianco and wait for hours upon hours anyway...might as well make a nice day out of it. Bring the following things:\n\n-Reusable cloth grocery bag\n-Large blanket\/beach towels\n-Playing cards and\/or board games\n-Disposable ice chest (if you don't want to buy beer\/beverages from Bar Bianco)\n-Sunscreen\n-Frisbee (optional)\n\nThere are ample patches and hills of nice soft green grass in and around heritage square...absolutely perfect spots for a makeshift picnic. Pack everything in the cloth bag and show up to PB around 4:30 or so. You'll have to stand in line for a few minutes to put your name in...but once you do...it's Picnic time! \n\nFind a nice shaded grassy hill...there's a quite ideal one over towards the Science Center. Lay out your towels and make a fun evening of it. You can relax with some beverages while playing cards with your significant other and as a nice side effect the people watching can be pretty great while you do so. By doing this, you're really killing two birds with one stone...you're getting to have a nice picnic...and as a side effect...you're negating the whole negative aspect of going to Pizzeria Bianco...the wait. Once your name gets called you simply toss everything back in the bag, throw the disposable cooler out...and voila...you're ready to have some great pizza in a cozy rustic pizza joint after your picnic. \n\nI really don't see why you'd want to do anything else...it's making the best of a less than ideal situation. Each time I go there I see people lethargically pacing around with a beer, bored out of their gourd...I just don't get it...might as well try and have some fun. \n\nNow on to Pizzeria Bianco itself...I didn't feel the need to really add too much content about the place itself, because what's already been said by the 300+ reviews is more than sufficient. I will say this...the pizza is great, but it's not all that different than pizza you can get at Cibo for example, where the wait is almost non-existent. What Pizzeria Bianco is, however...is a dining experience every Phoenix foodie must check off their bucket list at least one time. \n\n4\/5.
