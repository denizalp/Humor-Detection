Before the word \"Staycation\" was chic and cool, we would take weekends off and stay here.  We enjoy Paris for the following reasons:\n\n- It's location in the center of the Strip.  You can easily access many of the other Strip properties from here.\n\n- The view of the Bellagio Fountains.  As I described in another review, we love the Fountains @ the Bellagio.  You can request a room with a Strip\/Fountain view and if you're lucky enough to get it, you'll be treated to a wonderful scene.\nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz\/fountains-of-bellagio-las-vegas#hrid:5mSBxtxJXkCKC2b1hRys8A\n\n- Monorail station.  The monorail station stops at Bally's, which is next door to Paris and easily accessed.  I'm a fan of the Monorail, so it's always a bonus to be near a station.\n\n- Decent food selection.  One of our favorite restaurants in the Eiffel Tower Restaurant.  While we don't eat here often, we make it a point to do so if we have a weekend getaway here @ Paris.  The Buffet is ok and the Italian joint is pretty good too.  A little something for everyone.\n\nOverall, we always have a pleasant experience here.\n\nWill I return?  You can count on it.
