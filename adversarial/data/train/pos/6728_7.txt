I went here with my sister and I have been a loyal customer for a year. Usually had great service but learned there's new management. This was my sister's first time and after the massage she told me the girl didn't apply much pressure and she even massaged her carotid neck area. I kept hearing my sis making uncomfortable sounds lol. I mean we check a pulse there people, you don't apply deep pressure in her neck like she's going to gag. The guy I had I forgot his name, was kind of rough on my back. Funny part is he pulled and stretched my arms back and the top they provided me with slid down and my chest was being exposed! I was like, lets stop with that stretch lol. \n\nThe icing on the cake is the tipping. For some reason I tipped $10 and when my sis tipped $5 this older Asian lady who acts like the owner was like, \"Your girl was good, they do good job.\" Then she started speaking to the masseuse in Chinese. My sis was like okay, but I'm tipping $5. Then the lady said it's too little and to tip $10 because it's better. I was like WTF??? They offer free bottled waters, so I grabbed them, said thank you, smiled, and grabbed my sister outta there!! Poor sis felt bad and embarrassed. I was shocked and infuriated from what just happened! Never again!\n\n****If you tip less than $10 expect to get harassed and called out for being cheap. Oh yeah don't buy the Groupon, that old lady makes a scene accepting it. Not my type of place to do business. Management very rude and unprofessional****
