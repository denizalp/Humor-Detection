I am uber into Uber. \n\nUber is in Toronto, and many other major cities around the world. They are a boss car service that holds your credit card number on file and have an easy to use app that gets their car to you curbside as soon as possible. You input your location, and they tell you how long until they are there and who your driver is-- something I love to know, personal and accountable. \n\nIn my 5 or so times using Uber the time given has always been within one minute of their exact arrival. Well played, Ubie. Well played.\n\nFurther to their promptness and their easy to use app, their fleet of cars are sleek black town cars. Get to where you're going and look good. I am a huge fan. \n\nPEPPER POINTS: For including the tip in the price charged to your credit card. No fuss, no muss.
