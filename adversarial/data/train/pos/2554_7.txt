I took my SUV here for an oil change. The gentleman then came over and proceeded to tell me my car needed all new brakes, tires, roters, a battery, an alignment, and that the transmission was leaking. The best part was when he kept saying \"go home, have your husband explain everything to you and then make a decision.\" little did he know I replaced my own brakes on my own car last year. My vagina does not make me stupid. He was going to give me a fabulous deal that day - for just $800 I could have *most* of the work done. I left - took the car to our personal (and reputable) mechanic who said it was totally fine and nothing needed done. Yea...that's what I thought. But I guess my pea-sized woman brain couldn't have figured that out.....
