I left the doctors office because of the staff, they are ignorant and rude.  My husband however stayed and has been a patient for at least 8 years.  He was misdiagnosed by Heidi Baker telling him he was diabetic and had high cholesterol, she pumped him full of medication that almost killed him.  He followed up with Dr. Wolfson who told him he didn't have either.  We went to the ER to find he has to have his gal bladder removed so I called the office today and asked for a surgeon's name, the office staff said you have to make an appointment and pay for an office visit to get a name.  I HATE this office and everything about it.  I swear the staff didn't complete any schooling they ordered they degree from Sears mail order catalog.  Ignorant, Ignorant, Ignorant.
