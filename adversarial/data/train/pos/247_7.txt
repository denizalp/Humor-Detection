I wanted to give a 5 star review but it's hard to when your eating and see a cockroach crawling beside your leg!!!\n\nFor valentines I thought this would be a cool place to go because I love the location in Yorkville so we booked reservations and here's what happened.. \nThe restaurant is hidden inside a big \"shopping mall\" for Asians. It was cool though because it had FREE underground parking and in the -25 degree weather that's a bonus!\n\nWe went up the elevator and followed a group of strangers through the mall to the restaurant (which had no sign pointing which direction to go).. \n\nWalking into the restaurant you can smell the amazing food! \nIt was dim lighting with candles on every table (so romantic).\nThey seated us in the back at the \"couples tables\" with only 2 feet between each table. Everyone was listening in on everyone's conversation... It was kind of funny. \n\nThe servers were average and the food amazing as always!! \nI was just annoyed at how small the tables were.. We only ordered 2 chicken dish, 1 small rice and 2 nan and we had no space for anything more.... :( \n\nAFTER EATTING THE TABLE NEXT TO ME - THE GIRL STARTED FREAKING OUT SO WE LOOKED OVER AND THERE WAS A COCKROACH CRAWLING ON THR COUCH IN BETWEEN US!!!!!!\n\nAfter seeing that I was ready to leave ASAP.. Not going back. .
