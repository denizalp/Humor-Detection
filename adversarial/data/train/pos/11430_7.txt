Feels good to get back to my roots again. Part of my childhood memories involves Circle K. It was a staple in my upbringing. \n\nWe stopped by here so that my Uncle could get some smokes. I came in just to scope the place out. \n\nThey had a huge stand of bananas on sale. That actually made the place smell really good. It smelled like breakfast in there with the combination of banana's and coffee. \n\nThey don't have gas pumps here. Its strictly a convenience store.
