My last trip to the DMV was a 3+ hour nightmare.  So I went in to B&L and found them to be very professional and knowlegeable. \n\nThey had all the paperwork ready for me to sign when I got there.  Also, they had told me in advance I needed a smog check (something I never would've thought of - one extra dmv trip saved) and when I showed them my certificate they pointed out that the smog test certificate had been issued for the wrong vin (two extra dmv trips saved).  I faxed them the new certificate the next day and they got me my plates the day after.  \n\nTotally exceeded my expectations.  $45 to save three trips to the DMV?  Best deal ever!
