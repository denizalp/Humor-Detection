I'm so hot for this grocery store. I love Loblaws anywhere, but this one takes the cake in terms of design and selection (and price... yikes, it is on the pricey side, though no worse than a lot of the nicer grocery stores--Longos, etc--downtown). They have a sushi bar, an ACE bakery, a WALL of CHEESE. The fresh cut fruit and veg bar excites me in a way that makes me think I need to get out more. \n\nThe have fancy style cupcakes and all sorts of baked delights which anger me because I haven't eaten sugar since January 1st. The toiletries\/vitamins, etc, section is weirdly classy, with everything on these wooden shelves that makes me feel like I'm at a place that would call itself an \"apothecary\". \n\nIt's the kind of grocery store that makes you buy weird stuff you don't really need, like fancy mushrooms, exotic oils, wheels of parmesan, and curl boosting hairspray that was 21.99, and god, you KNEW it wouldn't REALLY work, so why did you buy it, you fool? Anyway... be careful of that if you don't want a crazy surprise at the register. Otherwise, it's a nice, clean, aesthetically pleasing grocery store that offers all your basic necessities and beyond, if you're hosting a fancy little do.
