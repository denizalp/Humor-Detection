Came here with some friends after being recommended. We ordered a beer each and were having a good time. Ordered two pizzas at the place next door and had 3 waters while we waited for the pizzas. Once the pizzas arrived we asked the waiter for three more beers and he said we couldn't have any more beer! He told us the manager said not to serve us any more beer! \n\nThought he was joking we ate some pizza and asked him where the beers we ordered were.. he again said we couldnt have any more beer. I asked him why and he said he was just doing what he was told, he couldn't independently say why. \n\nBackground: prior to coming here we were at Arizona wilderness. I had two beers and my friends had a flight each. We took a Lyft to 12 West and planned to go to another local bar afterward. \n\nWe found out this is not a place to have a good time, apparently if you want to very quietly have 1 beer this is the place for you. If you want to have more fun than what's allowed here I would suggest a library or a poetry reading. \n\nVery disappointed. I live near here and will not come back. I would recommend arizona wilderness, very friendly staff (Arizona ave\/Guadalupe) and great food. Try the peanut butter and jelly burger at Arizona wilderness, it's amazing!
