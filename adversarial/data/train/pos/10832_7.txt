The team at European Jewellery in the Eaton Centre are fantastic. My now fiancee and I had the pleasure of dealing with Sheri and Ryan. They were consumate professionals focused on providing an amazing customer experience and educating us on diamonds so as to make the right choice for us within our budget. At no point in the entire process did we feel a pressure to purchase, they provided expert guidance and thoughtful insights - it wasn't a transaction, but rather the most positive retail purchasing experience we could have dreamed of. The ring my fiancee ended up selecting was a beautiful Tacori ring, and I couldn't be more pleased with the final product. We will be forever grateful to the team at European for the role they played in this important milestone and without hesitation would highly recommend them to all of our family and friends making a purchase of jewelry or a time piece.
