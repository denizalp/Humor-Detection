So, I read a lot of reviews on here with three or two stars... because: \n- Girls wear make up and try to hook up with meat heads?? Who gives a shit! Do you go there to work out or judge? \n- No parking you say...? Where are you from, Iceland? You can't walk 100 ft to the gym? I thought you came to work out not drive your car to the entrance like a lazy ass...\n\nThe only thing that, to me, is missing is punching bags: with all the space they have, they could definitely include some kickboxing \/ muay thai classes. \n\nThe gym si clean [at least the ladies side] and everybody is welcoming. The instructors I had so far are fun and knowledgeable. There are tons and tons of classes from 5 am to 8 pm, so you really can't go wrong.\n\nI pay 31 dollars for gym access, towel service, 1 personal training session per month, and some other service I don't even remember [lol]. PRETTY DARN GOOD!\n\nSo stop complaining.
