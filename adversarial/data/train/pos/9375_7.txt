Backstreet's Back...ALRIGHT! I have fangirled over the Backstreet Boys since my teenage years and now as an adult, not much as changed. I am clearly not the only one because it has been 25 years since their debut, they are still going strong (with a new album on the horizon & world tour!) \n\nI missed the chance to see them when they announce their Vegas residency initially but when they announced additional show dates, I was ecstatic. I already had a trip planned to Vegas with friends so it was a great excuse to go see them (of course took a little convincing to get my friends on board). \n\nMy friends seem to enjoy themselves more than I thought they would (which made me really happy!) and it was a great time overall! We sang along to their classics and danced in our seats. \n\nI also appreciated that they performed of a few of my personal favorites (less popular) songs that they usually don't perform at the shows. \n\nThe show is definitely full of nostalgia - great for a girls night (boys night? No judgement here LOL), birthday, and especially for a bachelorette party! \n\nMy only gripe was that the show definitely had Vegas pricing - we got middle tier level seats and it was still MORE expensive than any BSB concert I've attended (in which the seats were even closer!) but hey...when in Vegas right? Their residency is coming to an end next Spring with only a handful of shows left - make sure to catch them for a fun girls night out and some ultimate 90s nostalgia! \n\nPROTIP: Drinks are also pretty pricey...I would suggest eat\/drink before or after the show if possible.
