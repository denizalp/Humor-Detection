Horrible service. When you tell me your going to call me back in 10 minutes dont take 200 minutes. And im not just speaking about sales,this also happened with a manager.If I were the owner I would get rid of all of them,shameful service. I decided to go back to lexus.More expensive but I just cant stand the \"sellomillionpeople\" mentality at toyota. As a side note the first time i showed up at toyota they have their salespeople standing outside waiting to ambush you the second you get out of your car.1.its amatuer hour to do that. 2. It was probably about 25 degrees outside with windchill and they make them stand outside for that? seriously thats employee abuse,shame on the dealership. no wonder your turn over is higher then pop in fresh. If my manager told me to do that i would tell him to take that low paying job and shove it. Anyways the boys over at lexus wanted me to thank you for being so inept at your job they appreciate the business.
