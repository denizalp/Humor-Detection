went to see this new place since it looked busy. After getting inside, sat at the bar. It took 20 min before someone actually looked my way. I was charged $9 for 12oz of a Belgian beer, that tasted exactly like Molson Canadian. The menu looked really impractical and expensive.  \nThe people that seemed to populate this place were typically parties of women in their 20s and a few guys, who probably think a place is high class just because it spells beer, \"bier\", and has some nice decor. Other than an image, this place is a waste of time and money. Rather than the decor and yuppie image, they should have better service and some real food on the menu at normal prices.
