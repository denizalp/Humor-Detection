Drove across town to fulfill my corned beef hash craving at this place. Because of all those remarkable \"Yelp\" comments on their corned beef hash, I could not get this place off my mind! Not only that, corned beef hash is my #1 preferred breakfast dish!!!\n\nCorned Beef Hash and Eggs: NO Question, the Best Corned Beef Hash I've ever had to date!! They crisp up the top and bottom of the corned beef hash serving which added a very nice subtle touch of texture and the meat inside stayed juicy, tender and tasty as can be! The portion was also Generous! The accompanied fried potatoes were far from dry, simple and delicious!\n\nFrench Toast - \"Jamms Style\" = corn flake breaded\/crusted: 4 Thick half slices of toast that were a little crunchy, a little sweet and had a nicely executed spongy consistency. Add some of their softened butter and drizzle some maple syrup over the bits of powdered sugar.. Yummm!!\n\nPot of Bread: Thanks Yelp for the complimentary\/special offer!  Extra Fresh, Extra Soft and Plainly Divine Roll of Bread!! \n\nWorth the Drive, Server was Very Nice and Enthusiastic, Prices were Fair and the atmosphere felt like how it should be!! APPROVED!!
