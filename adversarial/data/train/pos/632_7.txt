Excellent choice for a variety of delicious Korean-style dishes. \n\nIt's a little small inside and can get crowded; the interior has a very cool, clean, modern style. \n\nStaff have always been super friendly and very knowledgeable about the menu. \n\nThey have a decent sized menu but are mainly known for Korean-style bar food. Their fried chicken is their flagship dish. The chicken comes in a variety of ways including bone-in, boneless, tenders, or drumsticks. They come in spicy or soy-garlic or half and half. The server recommended the tenders, and they did not disappoint. Thin, fried strips of chicken still juicy and with a wonderful sweet, soy glaze. We also tried the bacon kimchi fried rice. Very good - slightly on the greasy side but very good flavor. We also went for the potstickers which were also very good (are you seeing the trend here..?). Crunchy outside and packed with meat and vegetables. There are lots of fried things here, and they are delicious. They have some non-fried dishes too like bulgogi and japchae (I think we stuck to fried this time, though). \n\nDefinitely give Bonchon a try if you're in the mood for bar food with an Asian flair!
