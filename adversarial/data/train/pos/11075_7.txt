This is the best karaoke bar I've ever been to! The ambience, service and food are all fantastic. I ordered the bbq chicken, which was so savory I would order it again. The pineapple crush (? I forgot the name) was my favorite drink. The karaoke rooms were equally impressive with their unique styles and high quality sound systems. And I absolutely love the fact that there's a LIBRARY with a neat selection of books! It's such an awesome hangout to bring your friends. YOU MUST GO!!
