This park is in a great location and has awesome play area..HOWEVER they do not maintain it in the manner in which I think is proper to have a clean fun place to hang out. Its also OVERRUN with pigeons and frankly on my last visit I was under the canopy and got POOPED on..YES folks landed right on me and in my purse so I can't give this place a five star review because I am covered in bird poop inside and outside a long the pond. It just needs some more LOVE.. However my kids enjoy it.. The water area is not the best but its also got the best slide area and a sand pit..which is another reason I dont dig it cause I am not a fan of my kids getting WET and afterwards covered in sand but you can dig for dino bones so thats cool right?
