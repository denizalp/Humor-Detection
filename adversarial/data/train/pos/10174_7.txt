I really had high hopes about this place.\nIt looks nice from the outside. The space inside was very open, high ceilings, lots of light from the windows. The waitstaff was friendly and helpful.\n \nHowever:\nThe parking situation is a nightmare. No parking lot. If you go at about 5:00-5:30 like we did, good luck. We had to park 2 blocks away. It is mind-boggling to me that the city zoning board would approve this place without parking.\n\nThen there is the food. I ordered New England Clam Chowder. Well, there were clams, but the broth was thin, and there were all these vegetables that made it taste more like minestrone. Why would somebody do this? Reminds me of people who make guacamole with about three cloves of garlic and bury any avocado taste.\nSo then I ordered their slow-roasted roast beef sandwich. Same kind of deal, there was so much other stuff in there I was not sure I wasn't eating a Muffaletta sandwich. If I wanted that I would not have ordered roast beef. \nLast but not least, almost all the seats were wooden. Not all that comfortable. \n\nI don't feel good about rating this new place so low, but damn, they sure did not impress.
