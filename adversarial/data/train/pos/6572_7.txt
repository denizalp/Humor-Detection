Smoker's Corner is a Calgary head shop that's head and shoulders above the competition. \n\nNot because they have a far superior selection but because they hire great people which makes for a great shopping experience. They carry all the bongs, pipes, papers and paraphernalia you need and the staff are helpful and friendly indeed. \n\nI especially love the ironic juxtaposition of this head shop's location next door to a health shop - priceless! \n\nI highly recommend checking out the Smoker's Corner. Believe me- I'm not just blowin' smoke here. Well, maybe just a little.
