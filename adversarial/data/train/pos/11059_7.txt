Hash House is famous for their comically large portions. We came here for breakfast on a Sunday morning. It was packed and the wait time was over an hour. \n\nOnce we were seated, that was when the real wait began. We knew right away what we wanted, since we were staring at the big menu in the waiting area. We split the house smoked salmon benedict and the Snickers pancake, which also came with two eggs. \n\nDining at this location is an exercise in patience. We witnessed several impatient parties around us. Our favorite was the hangry lady who complained about the pancake being so large that it was touched the table. The food took almost an hour to get to us. There was no secret why this happened. Scratch-made, slow food takes time and the restaurant was busting at the seams with diners. \n\nFor the amount of volume they experienced that morning, there was no compromise on the quality or taste. Our snickers pancake drooped over the side and touched the table, which I was fully anticipating. My inner fat kid kicked my inner germaphobe in the gut, before going to town on the oversized hotcake. The cakes were fluffy enough to support the chunks of candy. The sugars from the chocolate and nougat caramelized and were ooey and gooey. The side of over easy eggs looked silly in comparison. Everything smelled delicious and we were making the other tables still waiting for their meals jealous. The salmon serving was generous. It was flaky and moist and doused in hollandaise. The biscuit was tender and flaky and absorbed all the flavors cascading from above. \n\nThis was a great dining experience, but it was our first and last visit to this location since learning about the one a couple miles off-strip.
