I never get to go out to breakfast, but we went to Crackers & Co for a co-workers going away lunch early enough to order breakfast. SCORE! \n\nWe were a party of about 12, came in at about 11 on a weekday. I have to give high praise to our waitress. She was very attentive, didn't get anyones order wrong. Split all of our bills without being asked. Gave them all to the right people and brought our change quickly! \n\nMy food was FANTASTIC. I had the \"Traditional Breakfast\" with sourdough toast, scrambled eggs with cheese and country fried steak. Everything was hot, cooked perfectly and very tasty. Loved the crispy potatoes. The gravy on the country fried steak was good flavor, and the steak it self didn't feel like a grease bucket from being fried. I ate every bite it was so good. I felt like I was going to explode, but I didn't care. \n\nI only wish I could get out to breakfast more often. Sigh.
