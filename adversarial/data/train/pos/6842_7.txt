Fully body massage!!\nI woke up on the wrong side of the bed and found myself stiff in the neck and unable to move. I called the spa right away and the put me in right then and there. I had excellent service! \n\nSetting: People working there are very friendly and welcoming!\nCouple couches in the front desk. \nLockers are provided for your stay\nSauna (Wet and Dry)\nShowers that give you room to dry off\nDrinks provided by the host\nOne big hot tub \nLong hallway for message rooms\n\nMessage: silky smooth sheets, just like butter. The person that I had (forgot her name) had worked at the Wynn for 3 years. She did a great job in targeting my neck and shoulder where I was having my problems. She was very friendly and we had a great conversation! \n\nPrice: TOO much, yet again it is the Wynn so what do you expect. I spend around 160 for a body message + tip for 50 min (*this is where I bring down a star )= ) \n+ side, you can win it all back in gambling =D like I did!
