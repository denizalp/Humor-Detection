Came here for HH for a friend's birthday- the focus is definitely on the wine and whiskey, and the food is secondary so plan on a meal ahead of time or opt for the cheese or charcuterie plates. Location is large but maintains an intimate atmosphere and service puts them a step above other options in the area.\n\nWe shared a bunch of appetizers but nothing stood out as especially good- the tacos got raves from some in our group while the arancini stood out to others, but the taquitos, fried olives, and stuffed pepper dishes were not something I'd order again.\n\nOur group of 6 was welcomed by Michael, an owner or manager who is crazy-nuts about wine. He came over and let us sample one of his favorite pinot noirs, not yet available on the menu, and spoke with us extensively about it- his passion for wine was palpable, and is a large part of why I'll be recommending this spot to other winos.
