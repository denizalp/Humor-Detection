I've been a Jays fan since before birth, so I say with all due respect and sincerity that the SkyDome (which it will forever be for me) is kind of a middling baseball stadium.  Merely acceptable.  Don't come expecting Fenway or Wrigley Field or Yankee Stadium...it ain't even Exhibition Stadium, which had more character somehow.  Anyway, I'm not complaining much when it starts raining and the roof closes.\n\nJust don't try to order a hot dog at the 528 concession - they're really nice people, but they'll look at you as if you're a martian then announce sheepishly that they've run out and they're making more and please be patient.  This is during the 3rd inning, guys.  Come on.  Basic necessity - make sure you have hot dogs, ok?\n\nAnyway, they will stack you and your fellow hot dog waiters six or seven deep before the hot dog makers in the back conclude their intense discussion about obscure Marxist economic theories or the collected works of Albert Camus (probably) and make some goddamn hot dogs.\n\nI finally got my hot dog after no less than 20 minutes of waiting - but I thanked my hot dog-making friends because it probably wasn't their fault, really, and scarfed it down happily even though it was kinda gray and warm.  The End.
