8:30am and a sign on door saying open at 7am. Walk in to store. Notice no light on and I hear beeping. I say hello with no answer. The beeping became faster the an Alarm goes off. I walked out, not very pleasant.\n\nMy review created a response back from one of the owner in a way that person that cares about customers should. I haven't eaten there yet but do not believe they still deserve a one star.
