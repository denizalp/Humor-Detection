Sure it is way out in the west Valley but the drive is much shorter then a flight to Baton Rouge for those who want prime Cajun flavor.  The ingredients of the shrimp Po Boy blend together like the sweet sounds of Dixeland jazz and the offering here is akin to listening to that jazz performed by Louie Armstrong.  It's a shame this isn't more central to Phoenix.
