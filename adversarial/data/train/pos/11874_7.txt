Anyone who dines at the popular Pho Thanh, which is in the same shopping complex, knows that parking here can be tricky during busy times (noon and early evening). The store itself is much bigger than it seems from the outside, and there is quite a wide variety of Asian food and  merchandise within, though selections tend to be more limited compared to Lee Lee or Ranch Super L. You'll find most of what you'll need here in terms of Asian produce, packaged\/bottled\/canned foods - not all, though. For instance, I can't find Tiparos, the very popular brand of fish sauce which is now found even in regular supermarkets, although this place does have other brands including a vegetarian (!!!) fish sauce. I also wish they'd put better lighting in the store and make the floors a bit, um, cleaner.
