There's a little place tucked away downtown, over on 10th St between 4th and 5th Ave. It's a little place you may not have been to yet and so they don't know your name... but it's the kind of place that you'll step foot into once. You'll love. And you'll be back... again and again and again. \n\nAnju's a Korean-fusion joint. Chef Roy Oh hails from the great white north land of Edmonton. And he cheers for the Oilers. For that, we get along already! But besides that, Anju's alive with his heart and soul. And he's got a dedicated staff on board with him all the way.\n\nMost recently, we popped in here for a going away dinner for our dearest yelper Vishnu. With a party of more than 10 people, they do a lovely tasting menu. Tons of food and super reasonable. Only $43! Yeah, you read that right. Our shared dishes consisted of truffled yam rights, the best chicken wings in the world, deep-fried tofu, mackerel, and enough food to pack our lettuce wraps so full, we couldn't even finish them. Oh, and do I dare mention the flavoured soju? Our incredibly sweet, smiley and attentive server Keagan was right, that stuff's dangerous!\n\nIf you're ever looking for a spot to host your birthday party, office function, group of friends, people from out of town, whatever it is. You'll be wanting to call Anju first. Regular or not, they'll take care of you...and after that, well, you'll eat happily ever after.
