Um.  This is what customer service is about.  I've recently purchased a couple suits for my gigs as an emcee, and I needed a cheaper place than the dry cleaners by my place.  So I asked my girlfriend's parents if they knew of any good, cheap place to go.\n\n\"The one off of Warm Springs and Durango!  Right behind the Taco Bell!\"  So off I went.  I had neglected the inevitable notion that I WAS going to a wedding, or the logistics of what I needed until I walked through that door.\n\n\n\"Hi,\" the young girl asked.  She was very pretty.  I swallowed my tongue because of her smile, and just threw my bag of clothes on the counter.  She probably thought I was rude.\n\nAs she rummaged and sorted, she asked me if I needed the trash bag I had brought them in.  \"No, I'm good.\"  Who asks that?  How kind!\n\nShe totalled me up.  I was just shy of the ten article discount, but 20 bucks was STILL an incredible step up from my last escapade in acting like a big boy at the dry-cleaners. (by the way, it's worth noting that merely paying up front is a better way to go - you know how much you're paying and you just need a receipt to pick the clothes up!)\n\nThat's when I broke it to her.  \"What are the odds of getting this suit tomorrow?\"\n\n\"How soon?\"\n\n\"As soon as you can get it to me? Seven-ish in the morning?\"\n\nShe showed her teeth in uncomfortable, apologetic silence.  \"I don't... know.  Our guy just left.\"\n\n\"Is there anything you guys can do?\"\n\n\"When's the wedding?\"\n\n\"3.  In Costa Mesa, Southern California.\"\n\n\"Oh!\"  She looked around the room.  After a long trail of thought, she mentioned to me that the cleaner had already left for today, so even one suit wasn't going to happen today.  However, after I paid, she wrote the manager's name on the top of the receipt and told me to call at seven, when he arrived.\n\nShe wished me good luck, and I left, hoping I could get this suit in time.\n\nLong story, short, I was able to leave by 10 the next morning, suit in hand, and made it the wedding.  Suffice it to say, Malibu has a faithful, loyal customer, now.\n\nAnd in case you're wondering, I looked as fabulous as heterosexual gets.
