This review is based on the 3 times I visited this place.\nFirst of all, it's a nice coffee\/restaurant where you can enjoy a little meal, a coffee or a drink, or sit there studying with no problem.\n\nUnfortunately i've only been going there at night, so can't comment on the natural light, but it's a bit dark at night. Studying with computers is OK, but reading is quite tricky.\n\nFood is not too bad, i would give it a 4\/5. \nIt's a bit understaff I find, and we've been waiting for a long time for our checks, for the guy to pass by again to order an extra item. \n\nI would recommend it for a snack\/meal with a drink, I saw that on Fridays they have someone who comes in and play music !! It's a relax ambience. \nIt's 15$ for their table d'hôte (without desert) which is really not bad !! I enjoyed their chili (10$ on regular menu) and their table d'hôte that is different (menu du jour) everytime I went. My friend liked her salade chèvre chaud !\n\nIt did not get 4 because of the service.
