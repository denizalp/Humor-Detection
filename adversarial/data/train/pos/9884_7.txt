I've always liked Chili's for the most part.  They have one hell of a menu - lots of variety.  Something for everyone I think.  Service is usually decent.  The place is kept clean and they are good at engaging you when you walk in.  They have made things right when things were wrong without issue a few times so I appreciate that. \n\nSo here is the good news - pretty good burgers (not a bad one yet) and the deserts are great that I've had (the molten chocolate cake and the skillet chocolate chip cookie are my recommends).  The chips (freshly made) and salsa has always been a great starter.   I've been to this location a lot over the years; proximity plays a part in that.\n\nDownside - we have had a really nasty steak, bad bad ribs and the Fajitas have been hit or miss (especially when you order it with the steak).  So I won't even order them anymore here.  My friend calls their chicken, Chili's chicken - and that's not exactly a good thing, as my last experience I understood what she meant.\n\nSorry Chili's - Just my experience.  I'm game for chips\/salsa, a bacon burger and desert here!
