There must be  reasons that I have not yet visited Nak Won until a Yelp gathering.\n\nSmall and cramped without any ventilation. I smell like Pork Bone Soup after eating here and even my phone smell like that too! Good if guys thinks that smelling like meat is sexy, maybe my dog would think so?!\n\nIf the food is excellent, I would have been OK. But the Pork Bone Soup Table Cooking for 2 ($19.99) is just OK. Taste is just one dimensional: saltiness! I had better for sure. The banchan are run of the mills. \n\nIf the service is good, I would have been OK. But service here is non existent. Especially if you are seated in one of the private booth. Why bother to have the bell? I just want to ring it till one of the waitresses comes in and yell at me so I can have some services!\n\nThere are so many other Korean restaurants around the area with similar quality of food but services are much better, seating a lot more comfy. The only thing that save Nak Won is the location, right next to Finch Station. But I am willing to walk a mile just to have better food!\n\n7\/15
