We were supposed to get into Vegas on the halloween weekend at 8PM, and go to our 9.30PM dinner reservation at Stripsteak (upon the husband's request, having been there during his last visit).  Unfortunately the flight was delayed (surprise, surprise) and I was going to cancel the reservation, if not for the fact that the husband got extremely upset and insisted that we find out the latest they can fit us in.  Turns out that they were able to move us to 10.45PM, so we took that spot and rolled the dice.\n\nWe landed at 10.15 and went straight to Stripsteak, carry ons and everything, just so he got his Stripsteak fix.\n\nOne bite into the duck fat fries (served with three different sauces, my favorite being garlic aioli) and the rib cap (the best, fattiest part of the ribeye steak) I understood why he was so noticeably upset at the prospect of not being able to make this dinner. \n\nThe steak was the most amazing cut I've ever had - it was a relatively small piece (about 7 - 8 oz), but gosh, the meal was satisfying! It's not like digging into a hunk of meat, the fat was intertwined with the muscle so as to give the beef a soft, melt-in-your-mouth texture.  \n\nEqually fantastic were the the foie gras sliders (more, please!!!!!!) and beef shabu shabu (similar to the one served at the SF's Michael Mina) as appetizers, and beignets with creme brûlée as dessert.  But if you're only allowed to order one thing, it has to be the rib cap.
