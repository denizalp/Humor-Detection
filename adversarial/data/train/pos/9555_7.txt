I'm super sad to report that my experience at Secret Pizza was pretty mediocre. In fact, the 3rd star is because the price was cheap compared to most other food places found on the strip. \n\nLocated on the 3rd floor of the Cosmo next to the pool table, Secret Pizza is not only making some serious dough (in both senses of the term), but is also quite a bit of a wait at any time during the day. Three of us opted instead to get a whole pizza (some sort of supreme concoction) and a slice of the square cheese pizza (CHZ). The cheese square was basically cheese bread; delicious, but when was the combination of cheese and bread ever a bad idea. We got our pizza a few moments later and decided to eat it right outside in front of the pool table. We ended up only being able to eat one slice\/ea because they were so massive (except for the guy in our group who ate 2) and took the other half back with us to feed the rest of the  crowd we were with. The pizza was super salty (from the sausage topping, I think), super oily (BARELY saved my clothes from a stain of a lifetime!), and the crust was pretty dry. \n\nOverall, the pizza's just aight. Cheap, efficient, but nothing special.
