I moved to Scottsdale in May.  This place made me MISS the nice urban vibe of Phoenix proper.  It played \"hip\" music and made me feel more young and less like a middle aged burb mom.  The patio was perfect, the mac-n-cheese with green chiles top notch.  May have to go back and try some of the drinks....didn't seem right before car pool!  Looking forward to a repeat visit.
