A crystal healer's dream come true this place is truly amazing, only wished I didn't have to travel from LA haha!  Mike assisted me with my purchases and was very knowledgable, friendly, and helpful.  Such a wide carpet to choose from and outstanding quality with very reasonable prices.  Warehouses in SoCal do not hold a candle to this place and I was even blessed enough to see the giant Quartz crystal ball in the back!  I cannot wait to return to Vegas so I can stop by this amazing place again.
