Fave pho place in Vegas!! I've been coming to Pho Kim Long since I was very little and I feel like every time I've been to Vegas, I've stopped by. \nParking can be hard to find in the small plaza since there are a lot of other stores around and plenty more being added! \nInside is big and roomy and not tidy clean but what do you expect?\n\nI usually always get their Vietnamese iced coffee because it's so good!! Love how strong it is and I always have to pace myself when drinking it so I don't drink it all and leave the ice. \nThen I get a large bowl of pho tai with beef on the side! Their broth is quite good. \nRecently I tried their egg rolls and they're super crispy! I think I will order this again next time. \nTheir shrimp rolls were eh... wouldn't order again. Something about it tasted weird. \n\nAlso they're open 24\/7!! How perfect for Vegas!
