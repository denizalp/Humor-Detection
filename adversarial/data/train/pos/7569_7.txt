We were celebrating a birthday and my sister the non-yelper said that there was a sushi place that would in her words \"make you forget your name\" and did AYCE sashimi. I said BS no such thing we just go Sushi Koma, one of our usual sushi spots when celebrating something. Well we eventually made it to Hikari after stopping at Sushi Koma and yea we all forgot our names LOL.\n\nWTF! I'm sorry but why have I not heard of Hikari before? I love sushi but why am I wasting my valuable stomach space on rice when I can just eat AYCE SASHIMI instead!? You heard that right ALL YOU CAN EAT SASHIMI. You don't have to order nigiri, eat the fish, and hid the rice under the table or in your napkin.\n\nHere's the scoop. It's AYCE sushi that's open only for dinner and late nights (5 PM -2 AM) for $26.95 and if your a \"good looking lady\" you can save a couple dollars after 11 PM. Desserts aren't included in AYCE, that's fine with me I don't care for dessert after doing AYCE sushi unless their dessert is better than their sushi. AYCE sushi includes AYCE sashimi on most of their nigiri items. AYCE has a limit of 1 dozen oysters and 4 orders of uni per person, have those that don't like oysters and uni order them and you eat them. There's a 18% gratuity on parties of 4 or more, gladly pay for it service and food was worth more.\n\nFrom the average 3.5 star ratings I would have thought that Hikari would be just decent sushi but nope. Everything was excellent the quality, the quantity, and the taste. \n\nI had some a few Salmon Skin Handrolls throughout the night. http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/hikari-las-vegas?select=_P6m1rAyd8oh4l3-_MPVZw#D4KUtQ1Cic50BhCKVmSGtA They are just the right size to shove the entire thing into your mouth, maybe 2 bits, and not too large to second guess ordering, just order it. I have to eat Salmon Skin Handrolls at all sushi spots, I blame Blue Fin LOL\n\nI\/we also ordered plates and plates of sashimi.  Here's a few plates of some Garlic Tuna, Hamachi, and Salmon Sashimi. Tell me you don't just wanna eat some of that. http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/hikari-las-vegas?select=_P6m1rAyd8oh4l3-_MPVZw#_P6m1rAyd8oh4l3-_MPVZw Here's an up close on the Hamachi. http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/hikari-las-vegas?select=_P6m1rAyd8oh4l3-_MPVZw#XcRySQzXB1MppLpBwTRe0Q and from the back http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/hikari-las-vegas?select=_P6m1rAyd8oh4l3-_MPVZw#qA5cCBvGJzqrH8ibjEqqtg The quality was there, my mouth is watering. \n\nWe ordered the oyster too http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/hikari-las-vegas?select=_P6m1rAyd8oh4l3-_MPVZw#rRHD1ConhBDM6q0xC2ShCw They came in \"Japanese Style\" spicy sauce with green onions. So delicious to bad you can only order a dozen. They were clean and without all that sand and junk that I always see when I get oysters and they were not too small and not too large in size.\n\nI also did some nigiri.  Here's some Smoked Salmon and Garlic Tuna Nigiri http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/hikari-las-vegas?select=_P6m1rAyd8oh4l3-_MPVZw#tMwX9pumx2nIY6RcMNDE1w and some Uni and Tamago Nigiri http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/hikari-las-vegas?select=_P6m1rAyd8oh4l3-_MPVZw#pp6kMNdjGZjMaivt2GqMEw All perfect and I didn't even have to use a high quality camera or photoshop. We had more like Kama (Grilled Yellow Tail Collar), multiple orders of Deep Fried Soft Shell Crab, \"poki\" spicy sashimi salad, shrimp tempura, Agedashi Tofu (Fried Tofu), soups, rolls, edamame, potstickers, dumplings, mussels, etc. We basically had their whole menu but I don't wanna look at anymore pictures because I'm getting hungry.\n\nNot needing to eat rice with our seafood made a huge difference, I don't think I even felt that full and I don't think there was even a time limit. We were there for hours and we kept asking each other \"they not kicking us out yet. order more!!\" LOL. There's a lot of days to celebrate during the next few months, more stops at Hikari are coming in my near future. This is as of now, November 10, 2013 at 5:10 PM my new favorite sushi spot. Oops 5:11 PM.
