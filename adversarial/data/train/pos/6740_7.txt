Fat Tuesday... Is there a reason why Tuesday is the fattest day of the week? We came on Saturday and it was hella fat! \n\nI'm not really a drinker, nor do I party that hard. I don't need liquor to get the entertainment going, that happens all on its own. However, on my birthday my friends wanted an extra little excitement so they brought me to Fat Tuesday. I like sugar and we heard the drinks were like adult Slurpee's. Slurpee's and sugar are kind of the same thing! Sugar in a cup, works for me! \n\nFat Tuesday provides huge amounts of sugary liquor for cheap prices.  To top it off these frozen drinks are sold in fun long bottles....yardstick anyone? They got me the 100oz yard stick, because I always need to have the biggest and best! It was $36 with 16 shots and they added shots in it. Like I needed more... They got me $1 Jell-O shots to seal the deal. If drunk is your goal...then achievements will be made! \n\nThe next biggest drink is the yard dog, 32oz for $14. I'm not sure how much liquor is in the other drinks but I can tell you that everyone was drunk. I'm a lightweight so I ended up giving myself a black eye, hence the 20 shots for a lightweight. \n\nIf I haven't sold you on fast, cheap, or the black eye yet it gets better! You can sample all the yummy flavors of drinks so you won't order anything you don't like! It's hard not to leave happy... and if you didn't, it sounds like you didn't drink enough!
