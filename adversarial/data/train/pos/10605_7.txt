I am in love with this shop. The shop itself, the artists, EVERYTHING. I almost find it funny when someone cuts them self short with some crappy, hepatitis C, half clothing store, half tattoo shop type of place (you know the kind...). Every time I've been here they have exceeded my expectations. None of the snobby, elitest if-you-don't-look-like-lizard-man-you-are-shit attitude like other places. I would fully trust these guys with any idea I had and I'd be happy to pay for their professional, high quality work.\nI also wish I could transplant their retro day of the dead inspired waiting area into my living room. Just...awesome!
