I've been to a couple of automotive museums here and there. This one here in Phoenix\/Tempe was very interesting. A collection of fire trucks and fire equipment, neatly curated, neatly organized and with a binder of detailed information on each of the vehicles that you carry with you for reference. Much easier than reading a printed caption on a wall like you'd have in other museums.\n\nThe equipment is grouped and organized with the hand- and horse-drawn equipment in one room, the motorized in another and a more modern collection of modern vehicles in another. There's also a wall of helmets, fire marks (the doodads that insurance companies used for noting their customers) and of course, the Hall of Heroes.\n\nIf you're from out of town, you'll want to check the printout and see if you can find your own fire department's arm patch on the wall.\n\nThere's one firetruck that's open for you to climb into (and get a picture!) and there is a live radio listening to current Phoenix fire radio call outs.\n\nFor $7, I thought it was a pretty good deal.
