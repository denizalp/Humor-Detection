Our waitress was super pregnant.   We tipped her $20 on a $60 bill bc that baby needs formula, but then we thought aloud \"is that a gimmick to get bigger tips?\"  Only in Vegas do you see a pregnant cocktail waitress and assume she's scamming you.\n\nDrinks are very strong here and douche bags are abundant (pop those collars a**holes or wear your Ed Hardy shirts proudly)
