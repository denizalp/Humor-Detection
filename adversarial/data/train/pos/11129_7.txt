Willow Park is terrible. \n\nFor my wallet, that is. When confronted with such vast selection and such obvious decorative sex appeal, how does one refrain from partaking of the bountiful brews, the wonderful wines, the superfluous spirits? Guess what Riddler-era Jim Carrey. You don't. You pull out a few shekels and happily invest in a tasty treat\/possible future headache.\n\nBut guess what beer lovers. There's more. Hate disrespecting your body temperature by having to make crucial consumptive choices while indecisively languishing in the polar conditions of a walk-in fridge? As do I, as do I. So don't. Head over to Willow Park and choose from the cozy side of the refrigerator door. For those of us that don't subscribe to the \"drunk = cheapest = best\" mentality and therefore actually take time to pick out a beverage that either fits the occasion or is something untried, not having to freeze your nips off while you search is definitely a plus.\n\nIgnoring the wines and spirits in this review would be a mistake, although as various beer is my preference it sort of takes priority. However, Willow has no shortage of helpful staff to help you make wine choices for all types of occasions and preferences. Also, if you feel like learning more about the wines you are choosing from, check out Willow Park's Sommelier Program and the various wine education classes offered. Cool beans, right?\n\nSo in the wise words of Parks and Recreation's Tom Haverford, \"Treat Yo Self.\" Go scope Willow Park Wines and Spirits.\n\nHappy (safe) drinking.
