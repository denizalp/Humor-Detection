I worked here when I was 20 and I couldnt fully appreciate what they have to offer.\n\nIts unfortunate I didnt take advantage of my 30% employee discount, but I was poor since I worked there. \n\nI really enjoy this place now, the dining room tables are the best buy ever! I was shopping fore like 5 months for a table with bench seats instead of chairs. \n\nThen I remembered how many Cost Plus had.\n\nI went in and they have 4 different kinds for 199.00\n\nI dont know if you have been bench shopping lately but I find them ion the price range of 700-1200.\n\nI liked a lot of the tables but they didnt match my style so got a table somewhere else and bought the benches here. \n\nThey also have walkers shortbread cookies on sale all the time. Ok the ingredients on that: Butter, sugar, flour, salt\n\nSooo Goood\n\nBut yeah great buys on tables, but they have midget couches.\n\nThey are for like a childrens playroom.
