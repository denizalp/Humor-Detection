The nerdy girl in the glasses that kept leaning over showing her ass crack to the entire bar was completely rude and ruined my experience. \n\nAlso, it's cool that all your friends from the Scottsdale Whole Foods came down for a beer, but stop chatting and get me my damn beer, I mean there were only 20 of you behind a tiny bar.\n\nVery upsetting considering I love the Chandler bar.
