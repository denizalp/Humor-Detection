Tiffany's the iconic store that was made popular by the the fabulous Audrey Hepburn is a girls secret crush. Needing a better chain for to display my late husbands ring I feel Tiffany's is the only way to do this. All things can be healed with time. The unbelievable hole and loss in my life cannot be healed but by time, but the little turquoise box is a always a plus. In life he did bring wonderful gifts to celebrate the big milestones we all celebrate from this iconic store too!\n\nTo celebrate Fathers Day I am now able to open my heart and touch the ring that he once wore as the symbol of our love. I decided to celebrate Fathers Day with this wonderful gift to myself and bought a chain to display the trinket that was all I have left that is suppose to symbolize our eternal bond. \n  \nThe sales associates were very pleasant and knowledgeable as they listened to me pour my longings in the store. The sales associate was highly receptive to my needs. Grateful to the kindness and concern they displayed I did find a chain. My husband never liked gold he thought it was tacky looking. So his wedding band was set with diamonds in a platinum band. One of the key selling points in selecting the chain was the sales associate asking to see the ring which I produced. She asked my permission if she could touch it. Very appropriate with the raw emotions I am displaying today and experiencing. \n\nNot being able to control this raw emotion the sales associate relocated us to a private room. This was very pleasant too. She brought the chains to me and I was able to see how they felt and looked on the chain. The chain that I selected was  set in platinum and was 22 inches long. It was such an excellent and private shopping experience. I am so thankful to the wonderful service they were able to provide me. I now have the perfect way to at least keep a little piece of him and us with me always.
