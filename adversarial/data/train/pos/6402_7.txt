We had some really awesome cabbies during our trip. A lot of them were really friendly and when we'd ask them about hot spots, they would give us recommendations. Very useful, funny and cool. I liked the ones who would say, \"Well, this place is a lot of fun and perfect for young girls like you.\" \n\nI don't know, but I don't really think of myself as being \"young.\" I admit, I'm no spring chick anymore. My nights of clubbing until 4am are long gone, as was proved by this trip. To me, \"young\" is 21-24. So when multiple cabbies told us that Rain would be a great place for young people, I was a little iffy about it. I didn't want to be at some Spring Break party. \n\nWhen we got to Palms, we were able to bypass the velvet ropes because we were on the guestlist and went straight in. The space was pretty packed, but it wasn't so bad that we were squeezing through the crowd. The space is pretty cool, with a large dance floor in the middle where there's a fire show that goes off above the crowd a couple times throughout the night. \n\nWe actually encountered some really nice people who bought us drinks and were fun dancing with - even though the music wasn't that great. There were actually places to sit in the side room, though I think we may have just joined another party's VIP area. Even the lady attending the restroom kept J-To's boots in a safe place while she rested her toesies. \n\nAlthough the crowd was pretty young, everyone was having a great time. I guess I'm not as old as I thought!
