Idk if the people leaving such good reviews for this restaurant have little experience with sushi or they simply like coming here because of the novelty of overpriced food. \n\nThe tuna sashimi was the worst sashimi I have ever had. I needed to douse my food with soy sauce to make it edible even though I hate soy sauce!\n\nService was extremely slow. My nigiri arrived 75 minutes after I ordered it.\n\nSushi was extremely dry though it had some interesting flavors. Only positive note was the beautiful plating of the food. Except who cares about plating when the food is average-tasting at best.
