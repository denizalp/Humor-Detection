This show recently opened at the Westin and I had a free ticket for tonight.  The showroom at the Westin is a small venue, seating probably 150 or so in its present configuration.  \n\nThere are 5 ladies who do the burlesque and they are quite good.  The show beings with an announcer telling you to, \"Sit back, enjoy, and prepare to be teased.\"  Well, that does happen.  The ladies tease quite well.  The music is good and their dances are often quite sensuous.  Some of the best dancing was done with a hoop with two ladies, three ladies on saddles, and  Lola's dance to \"Whatever Lola Wants.\"  The one disappointment here was the very promising lady in the large balloon dance.  It had so much promise, but it went unfulfilled.  For their work, the ladies get 4 stars.\n\nA big factor of the one hour show is the comedy of Bruce \"Big John\" Mickelson.  If you've been to shows in Las Vegas very much, you've seen him before.  His act was stale years ago, and he doesn't do this show a favor.  What is supposed to be a comedic break so the ladies and scenery can change turns into an almost tortured attempt at comedy.  Understand, there were only about 20 people at the show tonight--something Big John noted many, many times as he continued to try to milk some laughs from some pretty awful jokes.  The show would do better with an unknown new person.  I expected Big John to break into his old BBQ routine he did at the Stratosphere Hotel years ago.  For this part of the show, 2 stars.\n\nOn average then, three stars.  But damn, those 5 ladies are fine!
