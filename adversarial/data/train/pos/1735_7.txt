So, I had a corporate question and contacted the corporate office.  This is a legitimate company, and they had no quelms discussing the product use and best uses, as well as replacing a product if I am not 100% happy with it.  Unlike Isagenix, which made me really ill - and it took God and Country to get a full refund for bioengineered food want to be stuff,  I should have never consumed in the first place.\n\nLets see how well these products work - it will take a good solid 3 months of ANY product to show results, so lets see!  In the mean time, I will swear by Luchiano and Nichole who wanted at first to eat me a live thinking I was calling for a \"buyers remorse refund\", who is now a personal consultant I would not hesitate to contact if I need a refill or assistance with a product!  Let the jury be out!
