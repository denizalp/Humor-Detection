This could be the start of a good joke but it's not... Two gringos walk into a Mexican restaurant and......\n\nI work at a clinic in the area and wanted to try something close by after work with a friend. The front desk person suggested this place so I thought I'd give it a try. Who doesn't like Mexican food and sushi? \n\nWalking in we were welcomed and seated right away. Once seated I started looking over the menu. Of course the first thing I look at are the pictures.... When I decided to start reading the menu I was lost... IT WAS ALL IN SPANISH, ahhhhhh! The waitress hadn't come by yet so I had to quickly text a friend to describe the rolls to me, but it was taking too long for her to get back and so I decided to order by what name sounded best... I decided to order the la lomita roll. \n\nWait time was a bit long as it looked like they were short staffed and busy but it was well worth the wait. When the roll came out it was bigger than I expected and tasted delicious. \n\nThis review was based off of one roll but it was a good roll. I'll definitely be going back but I'm going to bring someone who speaks\/reads Spanish with me.
