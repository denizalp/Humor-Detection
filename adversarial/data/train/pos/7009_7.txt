I went to High Tea ($18 per person) with a couple girlfriends on a Saturday afternoon. It was such a special experience! The High Tea includes your choice of hot tea (I had a strawberry green tea, which was delicious), lots of finger sandwiches (the chicken salad was my favorite), scones with cream and jam, and miniature pastries. \n\nThis is a place I would take friends and family for a unique, leisurely lunch. I would take my mom, but being back in the Grand Pacific Junction will no doubt remind her of my wedding at the little chapel down the street, and, ergo, my failed marriage. And if there's one time I want to avoid being criticized for my life choices, it's while I'm trying to eat tiny foods while wearing a tiny hat, dammit.
