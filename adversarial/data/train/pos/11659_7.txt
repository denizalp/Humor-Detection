I have the BEST bridal party EVER! \n\nMy bachlorette party was legit!!  I knew I was going to Vegas with a handful of my favorite girls, but other than that I had no clue where we were staying or the days events.\n\nWhen we landed, I thought I heard a gf tell the taxi cab to go to Tropicana.  When we pulled up to the Trump Tower I was blown away!!\n\nThe Good:\n*  The hotel does not have a casino so you don't have to inhale second hand smoke.\n* No casino means no crazy vibe.  It's the first time I've been to Vegas and was able to unwind and relax!\n*  The lobby was very chic with chandeliers and a clean scent.\n*  Staff was very accommodating with any\/all our needs for the weekend.\n\nBetter:\n*  We received VIP service and was able to use the Trump vehicle to get to our destination.\n*  The hotel is located across from the mall which houses some of my favorite shops:  Nordstrom, Zara, Topshop, etc.\n* Cab rides were inexpensive.  Maybe about $10 to get to the strip.\n\nThe BEST:\n*  We were on the 46th floor.  So high that my ears popped when getting to the room.  Which also means that we were so high that we didn't hear the train that other people are complaining about.\n* The two bedroom suite was AMAZING!!!!  So huge that we had a foyer!!! Each bedroom came equipped with a kitchenette with sleek stainless steel appliances.  AND we had 3 bathrooms for 9 girls.  No problems getting ready at all!!!\n*  The pool was very chic and had cabanas available.\n\nI would definitely stay here again.  It was such a great experience.\n\nMy only qualm is the fact that one of the rooms smelled like someone lit and smoked a cigarette in it.  We called the front desk and they were able to get staff to spray down the room and to eliminate our resort fees for putting up with it.  Great customer service!
