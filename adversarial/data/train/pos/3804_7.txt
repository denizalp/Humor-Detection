Not impressed at all.  Like many others, I have been coming to buffalo exchange for quite awhile. Checked out the new location and I didn't feel like I was even at a Buffalo exchange anymore.. yes there's definitely some cute clothes, & then there's clothing that makes you wonder, \"how the hell did this get accepted in the store & my clothes I brought in to consign got rejected?!! \".\nA pair of earrings for $16 (used)?! I absolutely love goodwill waaay better.  The wannabe hipsters and punks with septum piercings that work there should at least take one item of clothing from people willing to consign.. unless the clothes are unacceptably hideously frumpy or something but cmon! They are also Overpriced.. \nEverybody has their own sense of style so accepting clothing that's \"in style\" only, makes no sense at all. Everyone's own style and  individuality makes this world so diverse. \n-\"That is the key of this collection, being yourself. Don't be into trends. Don't make fashion own you, but you decide what you are, what you want to express by the way you dress and the way to live\" - Gianni Versace
