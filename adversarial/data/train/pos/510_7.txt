Last time my wife and I watched \"O\" was 15 plus years ago. The first Cirque du Soleil show we have ever seen. Since then we have seen a few other Cirque du Soleil shows including \"Ka\" and \"Mystere\" and not just in Vegas. We saw one show in Florida and another one in San Diego (Del Mar-San Diego Fairgrounds). \nAll the shows we have enjoyed very much but \"O\" has always been our favorite. We bought the CD as well as the program the first time we saw \"O\". You can also say that we have compared ever other show after to \"O\"; and that this particular show is the best of them all.\nThe colors, the performances, the characters and the music all together is just a masterpiece. The show just leaves you amazed. It is very hard to explain in detail what the show is all about. There is just so much happening all at once. It definitely takes one breath away. The most entertaining show on the strip. Worth every dollar spent. Bravo.
