The Far East has invaded the flavours of the west and people are rejoicing with a chorus of burps and groans. The growing trend in #Markham appears to be infusing traditional Asian ingredients into western cuisine classics and Black Bear is the next iteration of this trend. \n\nMy most recent visit was a solo venture where I went for the fat-kid trifecta; main, dessert and a frozen beverage. To start I went with the soft shell crab sandwich with a side of greens, the shell could have been cooked a little better as there were some softer undercooked (personal preference) parts in the middle, BUT the flavours were exceptional and I really enjoyed the crunch of the Panko batter on the crab. \n\nFor my drink, I went with one of their signature speciality drinks known as a beertail. No, your drink doesn't have a fish tail hanging out of it (you silly minx you) think beer and cocktail combined = beer-tail! They have several stakes but I went with the Gold Kron which was a Kronenberg Blanc help upside down in a pineapple crushed ice mixture - think of a carnival ICEE beverage except with pineapple... and beer. Yep, it's actually the perfect summer drink!\n\nMy last splurge was to have their panne cotta dessert. The difference maker here was in the slight infusion of Asian ingredients, this was a traditional panne cotta in style but infused with both red bean and matcha flavours. You all know how I feel about matcha but this was far milder than some of the chalk dust texture some places are using when they OD on the matcha powder. I enjoyed this and ate the whole thing without guilt nor reservation.\n\nFor the 905, it is a smaller space, however, the food comes fast to expect turnover to be the same. Overall, a good experience with a few very minor hiccups not worth lingering over.\n\nEatcrest Out
