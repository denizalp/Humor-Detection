I need to give Culver's a high five. I normally don't go to Culver's for lunch since it is crazy busy and packed with the Honeywell and Cox crowd. But today I braved the crowds and must've had that \"get out of my way IDGAF look since I didn't have my breakfast today vibe\" since I zoomed to the front of the line and ordered right away and even found an empty table. \n\nI was in need of a fix and had a delicious and juicy double cheeseburger with all of the fixings. The cheese was actually melted on the burger, did you hear that Mc Donalds and Burger King? \n\nCulver's is more than a burger place. I also really enjoy their hot ham and swiss cheese sandwich (think grilled cheese but add the ham). Occasionally I'll eat the fried fish as well. My wife swears by the Turkey BLT sandwich. If you have a couple of bucks left over, try the ice cream sundae or any other of their dessert concoctions. \n\nServices is always spot on. So I think the menu is diverse enough to satisfy everyone in the family, plus it's very easy on the pocketbook.
