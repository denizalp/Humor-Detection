This store is definitely not Caesar's or Nike Outlet Malls size, but it's kept pretty clean and organized, still a good handful of selection to choose from.\n\nLocated in the same parking lot as Target, Ulta, PetSmart, etc. \n\nMartha, the sales associate, was definitely helpful with suggestions and pointed out new items that just came in or may be popular by customers.\n\nI'll be coming back, especially that it's so close to work \/ gym.
