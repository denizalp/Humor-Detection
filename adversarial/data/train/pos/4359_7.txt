i have 2 words for you: passive. active. dividing the dog park into sections based on tempermant isn't smart, it's f'n brilliant. \n2 gates upon entrance and exit safe it up so i have no worries that my shelter dog will hit the streets again. \nthis dog park is clean, the people are friendly and so are the dogs. finally, a place where we can all get along.
