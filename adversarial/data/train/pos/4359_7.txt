Called at 1030 am to book a birthday couples massage for 645 same day, set up whole day around it reservations for dinner, paintball etc. They call me at 430.. Don't leave a message. I call back, they tell me they made a mistake on booking our couples massage isn't happening but offer a sugar scrub  or a future date for a couples massage?! Are you kidding me....
