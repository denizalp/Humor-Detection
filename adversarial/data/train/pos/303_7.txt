Has been our go-to hotel for the last 4 years. Second time here for the 4th of July weekend. We don't stay at the Las Vegas strip anymore only because of all the traffic and congestion with cars and people. \n\nRed Rock has a number of pools and one main pool with a fountain in the middle. I enjoy hanging out at the chairs that sit along the water. \n\nThe hotel itself is truly a resort in itself. They have all the amenities including its own movie theater and bowling alley. \n\nThere's plenty of shopping in the area and a Costco just across the street. \n\nIt's fun for all ages if you don't want to be around the Las Vegas strip.
