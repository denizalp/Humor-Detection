Since I'm off the pizza kick for a while, I only ordered veggie appetizers at CPK and a slice of pumpkin cheesecake. \n\nShort story shorter: I couldn't tolerate either. \n\nThe shishito peppers were so oily I couldn't get the sheen off. Yeughk. \n\nFried mac and cheese was deplorable. They look like fritters but taste like sea sponges.\n\nPumpkin pie was pedestrian. \n\nNot this time, CPK, Not this time. \nYou might win some, but you just lost one.
