Pretty big selection... perhaps too big.\n\n\nI brought my two hipster friends from out of town here hoping that they would be able to find enough micro brews to shut them up for the rest of the weekend. They certainly appeared to be in hipster heaven as they skipped down the aisles like kids playing candyland. The only downside was that they wanted to shop around for hours looking at every handcrafted bottle, discussing all the local hops used to brew something something please kill me. Can we not even get drunk anymore without worrying about whether or not the alcohol was made within 100 mile limit? I digress as this isn't really the fault of total wine...\n\n\nPoint being, they have a large selection. Prices are pretty reasonable though a bit pricier than Costco where I usually get my 5 gallon jugs of moonshine.
