I am definitely NOT a fan of Kabuki. Of all the times I have been to the restaurants in California, I have never once suggested going there on my own. The prior times were because of some sort of event with friends.\n\nWhy did I go to the one in Vegas? Well friends that live there wanted to have dinner with the BF and I and they picked Kabuki. I decided to give it try because when you least expect it, things can surprise you. Right? But unfortunately, this time it didn't happen. \n\nI'll give the place props for being the nicest (decor + ambiance) one I've been to. However, I'm still not a fan of the food. I was very disappointed with the sushi yet again. I could get way better and way cheaper at other places. However, I did love their Tokyo Mojito in Lychee flavor. That was pretty delicious. The calamari was decent but I enjoyed it better than the rolls.\n\nThe other thing I didn't get was their plates. I mean they really tried to make it all nice and super chic but their humongous heavy frosted glass plates (for a small roll on each) were not working. We were seated at a booth and we BARELY got everything to fit. Someone needed to work on their space management or make the tables bigger.\n\nBack to the positive. One other thing that I liked is that it's located in a pretty shopping area. Much like Victoria Gardens and it was beautiful at night (minus the overhead airplanes landing and taking off). haha\n\nUnless someone absolutely has\/wants to go, I won't even think of going back. If I have to, I'll stick to the alcohol and their appetizers.
