I really love this restaurant. I'm so happy we have one in Las Vegas now. The service is always great and the food is consistently delicious. Today I wasn't asked if I wanted sweet or salty ham which was a bit disappointing.\nWe realized that corporate was in the building which was presumably making everyone nervous. My boyfriend and I have worked in restaurants for many years when we were younger and it's clear that the corporate suits do not belong in the restaurant, or the kitchen. As we ate we watched these guys literally standing in their suits in the doorway of the kitchen. If I was a server I would have \"accidentally\" spilled a tray on them. If you're not helping get out of the way. This place is always packed and the staff is running it like a well oiled machine. Just let them do their job!
