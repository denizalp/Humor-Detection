Came in for a quick lunch, saw they did tacos and ordered the ahi tuna tacos which I inquired if they came on corn tortillas and was told they did. Sadly when they arrived they were on flour tortillas which if I would have known I would have ordered something else.\n\nTacos were decent once you got past the fact that they used gringo tortillas. Staff really should have known this.\n\nJust a little follow up, reached out to the owner after the below message and two weeks after that still no contact by the restaurant as she said would occur. With that I changed this from three stars to two.
