I visited Padre's some months ago and was pleasantly surprised by my visit. I didn't go in with too high of hopes because I was just going to grab a quick bite. It happened to be Happy Hour at Padres which meant reduced price drinks and appetizers. I chose to go with the Padres Margarita on the rocks with salt (3.50). My drink was a-ok. Nothing amazing about it, but it was good. I ordered the Mexican street tacos and the pork tacos. Again, both were a-ok. I prefer the street tacos over the pork tacos but that's just personal taste. \n\nI would like to try Padre's again for a dinner visit. I hear they have a Salsa group playing on Friday nights! Might be fun to try a new meal and kick up my heels!
