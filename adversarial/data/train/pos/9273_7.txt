Damn you, Mercurios, for opening within walking distance of both my gym, and my apartment.   Go to hell, for having convenient hours into the evening and being so accomodating as to let me taste all the gelatos before I buy.  \n\nTHEN you had to go and open your pizza oven and serve delicious pizza at great prices with nice outdoor seating.  TOTALLY NOT NECESSARY.\n\nMy thighs will never be the same.\n\nAfter tasting the Amaretto gelatto, I discovered that my life had been missing something all along and that amaretto gelato wsa its missing piece.\n\nSounds like I've got a food addiction.  Don't judge me.  Try the gelato and pizza and then you tell me how you're doing SO MUCH BETTER than I am.\n\n;)
