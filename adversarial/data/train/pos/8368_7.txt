We went to Weiss' for brunch on Sunday.  We had not been here in years and it seems like it may have gone downhill a bit.  Per other guests crammed into the waiting area, there was a 35-40 wait, but no one came to put our name on the list until we were standing there for 15 minutes.  He actually started taking the name of the group that just walked in the door instead of us and the others that came in before that group.  Unimpressed with that.  \n\nWhile I was waiting, I noticed that this place needs a major overhaul.  It looks really old and run down.\n\nWe were taken to a table after about 35 minutes and the chairs had standing water on them.  I asked the waitress if I could have a towel to wipe it down, but she was too busy filling the sweetener containers and was rude.  She never brought a towel so I had to ask a bus boy who brought some napkins.  Of course, she ended up being our waitness...figures.  \n\nI was torn between breakfast and lunch.  But I went with lunch and ordered the French Dip.  The meat was fantastic and would have been good on its own, but dipped in the au jus it was heavenly.   The pocket bun looked good, but it was so massive I just eat the meat with a fork.  The awesome food is the only thing that saved me from giving Weiss' one star because the experience was utterly lacking.
