My wife and kids recently stayed in this hotel. While my wife was breastfeeding our 10 month old outside of the Cafe, a security guard came up to her and told her that children are not allowed near any gaming devices. She kindly told him our 10 month old won't be playing any games, she is just sitting outside the cafe to feed our son. The security guard then told her that she can not breastfeed in a public area, and he can have her kicked out of the hotel for doing so. He told her she could feed him in the bathroom, or outside. At this point my wife started crying because of how she was being treated, and he escorted her to the front lobby, all the while our son was crying because he was hungry. \n\nSo, stay at this hotel if you feel like being treated like shit for simply feeding a hungry 10 month old. And then be told you are a liar, and don't have any rights as a person.
