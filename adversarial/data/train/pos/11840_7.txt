Big Grove can be the best restaurant downtown depending on the day.  They are always the best option for brunch. This can be attributed to the best Bloody Mary in town which is served with a stout or porter 'back'. \n\nThe menu always provides interesting choices and is a good length. You have enough choice without having too much choice. A visit is not complete without at least one deviled egg. Aside from the Bloody Mary, they have the most interesting drink list no matter the season. \n\nThe atmosphere and decor make for an experience that feels upscale without being overly stuffy. When the weather is nice there is no better outdoor seating in downtown.  The only thing that keeps this restaurant from five stars is the service (aside from one or two servers) is not up to the quality of the restaurant.
