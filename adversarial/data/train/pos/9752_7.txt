What looks like a nondescript dive bar from the outside turns out to be one of the coolest little places you can find. The whole place is very dark with the front room containing some seating at couches and tables along with the bar. Just with this I liked the place, but the other room is even better. That's where they have old school bar games like darts, skee-ball, and pinball. If you can't have a good time here you're not trying! Service was great and they had an excellent selection of liquor and beer.
