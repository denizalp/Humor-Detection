2 words? creamy dream. get your head out of the gutter. \n\ni'm on a yogurt kick, and this place is across the street from my office. that's not why i gave it 5 stars though. \n\nI gave it 5 stars bc the vanilla yogurt is EXTRA vanilla-y. the blackberries are so plump. I have never seen strawberries so red. and kiwi so firm. \n\nwhen i leave i feel like skipping with my yogurt. only $4 for a cup filled to the top with the freshest fruit and the most vanilla-y vanilla ever?? I understand that tart is the new trend, but my sour face is not attractive. \n\nand this is going to sound bananas- but  their yogurt isn't too cold. it's the perfect temperature to taste all of the goodness and not give your tongue freezer burn. \n\nI won't lie- i've been replacing my lunch lately with this creamy dream. so worth it. and the fact that it's fat free and mostly fruit takes away some of that guilt.
