Literally one day after j got a fill from here my nails chipped and popped off. They are closed so early I wasn't able to make it after work to get them fixed so I took all my acrylics off. When I took them off, I saw ridges in my nail beds. Being that I know how to do nails but I'm too lazy to, I know they don't have very good products. Also they are a nail shop that tells u what u want versus actually doing what you want. I came here twice and won't return
