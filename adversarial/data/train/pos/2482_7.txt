I kept hoping I would run into Don Draper.  \n\nNo.  I'm serious.  Where was he?  \n\nEven though I had no luck finding my Mad Man, I still had a great two night stay at the Valley Ho.  This retro style (mid-century modern style) takes you back to a time where The Jetsons were the future and motor inns were the norm.  However, the decor has the millennial twist to it so you don't feel like you're staying at with the Bradys.  \n\nMy room was fantastic, comfy bed (not so comfy pillows), great patio and awesome bathroom.  I loved the tub, even though I didn't get a chance to actually use it.  It looked pretty, 'nuff said.  \n\nI also loved the pool and adjacent hot tub.  Even though I was out there with girlfriends, I think my most favorite part of the trip was just hanging out by the pool, listening to some tunes and drinking John Daly's.  Mmmm....Laying out, with people splashing in the pool and the hotel in the background....if you squint just right you may get your Don Draper apparition.  Or so I hoped I would, with the help of my friend, John Daly.\n  \nAlso, poolside bar service was amazing.  Our waitress was great and I loved that servers constantly came around just making sure you had water to stay hydrated.  \n\nSo why four stars?  A couple of bratty gripes actually.  Roomie saw a bug in the bathroom.  Yea, I get it.  Its Arizona and all, but I don't want bugs in my trendy hotel room.  Also, housekeeping came super late, like after 5pm late.  We actually asked a the front desk if that was normal.  Lastly, despite really liking the food at Zuzu, the service was disgrace.  Otherwise, I really enjoyed my stay here.  I'm not sure when I will return to Scottsdale, but if I do, I know where I'm staying!
