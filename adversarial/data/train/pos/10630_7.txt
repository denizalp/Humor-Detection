Not too long ago on a lazy weeknight, Kay and I ordered from this Fox's Pizza Den franchise simply 'cause...I hadn't reviewed them yet! \n\nYou're all shaking your heads out there on the web. \n\nSo was Kay. \n\nA local chain and fixture in the Pittsburgh area, I remember trying the pizza at their Brookline location a few years ago and coming away moderately impressed with it. This time, however, the pie -- A BBQ Chicken Pizza being the specimen in question -- had a sodden, puffy, overly salted Pizza Hut quality that somewhat rubbed my palate wrongly. Not that I can state that it was...\n\nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=THkGcjNKdoE\n\n...but it was a floppy, nearly flavorless dud for the most part.  I barely tasted the chicken cubes, the ketchup-ish BBQ sauce, or the gaudy cheddar cheese. It came off as something one could expect to have at a Superbowl party thrown by Rachel Ray. \n\nHowever, the rest of the meal was errr...foxy...\n\nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=aL-6HqtjG-I \n\nThe Italian Wedgie, a sandwich I've been fascinated with since having one from Ardolino's way back in my youth. Utilizing a pizza crust in lieu of a roll, the wedgie was a marvel of taste and crisp texture, ham, hard salami, provolone, mozzarella,\n green peppers, onions, lettuce, tomato, and a slam of an Italian dressing all communing together under a shell of chewy dough. If only the base of that pizza tasted like the house that built this pseudo-submarine. It coulda been a 5 star affair...\n\nFurther exemplifying our promptly delivered dinner was the Meatball Hoagie, which was a soft, squishy, gooey, robust, ruby-red rib-sticker of a grinder. Making that clucker pie all the more tragic were the Apple Strudel dessert sticks wit their warm, sticky mouthfeel and glazed, sugary disposition. \n\nA pizza parlor does everything right but the pizza. Imagine that. Make a Fox's run in the near future or have 'em run to you...\n\nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=ERMEneOrTkI
