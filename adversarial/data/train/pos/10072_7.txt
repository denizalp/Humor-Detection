Of all the places I ever went to on a regular basis as a Pitt student, LuLu's Noodles is one of the places where I legitimately loved the food and wasn't just picking up a meal on a poor student budget. I still love stopping by these days to enjoy my favorite college meal on occasion. \n\nI usually end up ordering ramen or a similar noodle soup - after all, 'noodles' is in the company's name for a reason! I have never had a bad experience here. My food has always arrived in a timely fashion, has been cooked properly and has featured only the best flavoring and seasoning possible.\n\nAn added bonus is that a Razzy Fresh yogurt shop is just down the street - it's easy enough to pop in for dessert on the rare occasions that LuLu's enormous portions don't have me rolling to my car before I fall into a food coma.\n\nI absolutely recommend LuLu's to all; the food is delicious, the portions fantastic considering the price, and bound to satisfy anyone who has a craving for some noodles.
