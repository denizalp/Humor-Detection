Taco Taco. From my last review almost 5 months ago to now the only thing that's changed is the price. I spend 40 cents more for lunch than I used to. But I'll gladly pay it for an Al Pastor burrito that is unlike anything else I've ever had. The chips are made fresh every day. And over the past few months and many visits I've only seen the salsa bar run low on salsa once....and they took care of it fast. The Mexican Coke is ice cold and service is fast and friendly. \n\nThe 5 Stars I gave out months ago is still just as valid today as it was then. When I have family come in from out of state, this is where I bring them. Everyone in my family loves this place, so much so that social media checkins prompt a round of I wish I was there comments every time. \n\n5 Stars, and a bump to my Best of Las Vegas and Failsafe Food lists. Again all of it earned. They just celebrated their 1st Anniversary and with food this good, it certainly won't be their last celebration.
