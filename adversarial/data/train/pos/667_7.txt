Repeating off many of the reviews here...yes this place USED to be \"thee\" spot to go to. But now you're even better off going to Goldspike or Pkwy Tavern. If you look at all those 5 star reviews they're all from 2013 ish. Much has changed since then.\n\nTheres a cover to get in. There's a cover to go UPSTAIRS...Yes I'm serious. That shit isn't even worth paying for. Douchey security over reacting at the smallest things. This place became elitist as f*ck.\n\nIf it's a saturday night at dtlv just skip this place over and go to the Griffin.
