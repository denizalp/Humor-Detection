Fergie likes it, so I like it!\n\nThe staff here, especially Sheena! are amazingly kind, friendly and put Fergie (my big black pug baby) at immediate ease. They carry all kinds of pet products, and everyone is fairly knowledgeable on what will work best for yours. Love also, that despite being a locally owned business, their prices are on par or cheaper with their big box competitors. \n\nNot to mention all the furry friends I make when I come here! Hello dogs! It's nice to meet you. :D\n\nGot a dog that hides under the bed and bares his (or her) teeth when the clippers come out? Bring him to Sheena, she's a total boss. Would come here more if I lived in the area, but if you live near Edmonton Trail in the NE... well, why haven't you been here yet?
