I hear they are good for banners, etc. But I needed business cards and saw one of several signs outside that read \"$18 Business Cards\" so I turned around and went back and went inside. I was greeted and I said I saw your sign for business cards. Young man said great here are our prices and turned the computer screen around and the lowest price available was $74 up to $259.  He never spoke again as if waiting for me to make a selection. Is that the best price? \"Yes\". Thanks but no thanks....exit. \"Have a nice day\" lol. This is a sign company with horribly misleading signs promoting their \"own endeavors\",  Should I decide to engage in misleading advertising I'm sure this place would come to mind first. Perhaps the most entertaining thing about this place though is the total lack of personality. These guys are like flatliner robots. Clearly everyone here lingered last in line when personalities were dispersed.
