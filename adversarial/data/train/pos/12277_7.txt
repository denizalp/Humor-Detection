Sweet. To whomever added this to Yelp, thanks!\n\nI'm loving our new park. This was supposed to be the next Mountain's Edge park that opened after I bought my house almost a decade ago. The scope was scaled back tremendously. In fact, there's absolutely nothing on the other side of the paseo. But the amenities we ended up with are a welcome addition to the neighborhood. Four basketball hoops, a small playground for kids, a couple of beach volleyball courts, and a large grass area are good enough for me.\n\nI've made it a habit of walking to the park with the dog as soon as I get home from work. I just bring a picnic pad to sit on and enjoy the recent cooler weather. I'm even starting to learn the sprinkler patterns so I know when to get up and move.\n\nNow all we need are some Pok√©Stops.
