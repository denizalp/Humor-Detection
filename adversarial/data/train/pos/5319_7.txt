Ok, I'm apparently not a fan of the meat.  They are too thin and dry yet amazingly greasy looking and tasting.  Now, the taste was not bad, just the overall product was not a good as we thought it would be as the burgers are cooked to order.  The fried curds were ok and the shoe string fries were ok.  It seems like they are targeting Culver's but they are not quite there.  The atmosphere is cool and while we didn't try it the shakes looked good.\nWe definitely want to go back to try the custard so we'll give it another go at some point.
