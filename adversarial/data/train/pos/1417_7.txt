Most Vegas food on the go is mediocre at best and likely overpriced. So I must say, I was extremely delighted & surprised to dine here at Earl of Sandwich. Now me and some friends came here after a long night of drinking and a 3-hr heater on a craps table. With the afterparty drinks being on the house, we were still pretty tossed, and this sandwich hit the spot. Sure, it was 9am and we were mad drunk while other tourist families were giving us the staredown, but I do not apologize! After some sleep, I was thinking about killing the world to cure my hangover, and then I started to think about real things like, \"was that sandwich really that bomb? or were u really that wasted?\" To get to the bottom of it all, I came back...and it really is just that good.\n\nThe place is fast and what value! $5.95 flat rate the whole way through! I ordered \"the Earl's Club\" (Roasted Turkey, Smoked Bacon, Swiss Cheese, Lettuce, Roma Tomato & Sandwich Sauce) and \"the Original 1762\" (Freshly Roasted Beef, Cheddar Cheese & Creamy Horseradish Sauce)--both scrumptious! The toasted Panini and hot ingredients make this. My biggest complaint is that they could've been bigger--I feel like I could easily eat two of them in one sitting but I'm a fatass personally. I feel like most chicks would be satisfied with one of Earl's \"Cannonballs!\" [sorry, cheesy bad taste joke ;] But seriously, my other friends recommend that sandwich and \"the Italian\". Definitely coming back the next time I'm at Planet Hollywood. I would suggest this to anyone in the area looking for a quick bite at a reasonable price.
