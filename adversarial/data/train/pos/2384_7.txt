Looks well maintained and has a lot of amenities, from bars and restaurants to small convenience stores. Home of the Dolphin and tigers habitat, also they have a few shows here too. Walking distance to pretty much anything on the strip, large parking structure. Stayed here for 2 nights and the room was nice and clean, looked recently remodeled. My only issue was with the ventilation in the room, there was no fresh air, and you can't open to window either.
