I heard all my Filipino friends talk about Jollibee but never got around to trying it. I'm not saying it's bad, it's just more of an acquired taste type of thing... I might have also made the mistake of thinking that spam and spaghetti was a good idea. It tasted funny. That's all I'm saying. Kind of bland, the noodles weren't properly coked through so that didn't help either. I'm not sure why theres so much spam, I thought that was Hawaiian? Weird, anyways I took one bite and the rest into the trash. \n\nThe chicken which everyone reaves about was pretty meh. It was warm and crispy, but the coating was so thick and dough-ey. I'd much rather get KFC, which I've steered clear of for years. Service is really bad, I was asking questions and the girl at the cashier didn't really know the menu, hence I got all the weird and bad stuff.  Why Jollibee, Why. I'd maybe go back but it'd have to be with some Filipinos so they can educate me on the Jollibee culture.
