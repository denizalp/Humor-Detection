The best thing about Muzik is the building it's in. It used to be the Horticulture Building in Exhibition Place and when you're waiting in line outside (warning: go early cause the line is loooong and the bouncers selective) you feel like you're entering a small palace or parliament building. Inside, it's a great space, very cool decor, with a definite euro-vibe. Lots of pretty girls in pretty dresses, and pretty pretentious attitudes. A little on the snobby side, the service is a little cold and it takes about a year to get a drink, but the atmosphere is awesome and the crazy cool decor makes it feel like a hotel party. There isn't much of a dancefloor, but there are hot male dancers which is always a plus! Bottom line, great place to go with a group of girlfriends for a glitzy night out.
