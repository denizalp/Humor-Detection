I was a member of LA for a bit over a year. And... this is what I have to say ;) \n\nPros\n- Offers a swimming pool \n- Great new equipment; there are two floors (first floor: resistance training, second floor: cardio, bikes, treadmills, etc)\n- Several TVs were placed beside the cardio equipment \n- I didn't feel the pressure to buy costly personal training sessions (which is something that often comes with purchasing a gym membership)\n- The change rooms were very clean and upscale; it was nice \n\nI personally liked the division because it can be intimidating for girls to work out side by side with men. They also have a dinky little room which is a Women's Only Exercise room (they have a few weights, a lot more cardio equipment). \n\nCons\n- I believe the pool is salt-water (rather than being maintained with chlorine); although this is probably better for the body, I was constantly dreading the thought of getting salt water in my eyes and mouth \n- The front desk staff was a bit mouthy- seemed to be talking to each other a lot; I guess this makes it better\/easier if you're trying to sneak someone in...? \n- I noticed that because the cardio section was on the second floor, that it became easy for guys to perve on girls (I guess you're at the mercy of this at any gym) \n- There is an initiation fee which you can't avoid (I think I paid $140 on top of my $30\/month membership)\n- There is a minimum of a 12 month contract (which can be restricting if you only want it for a number of months), however this is standard with most gyms \n- Parking can be congested (especially after work- plan ahead... work out on the weekends\/during lunch?) \n- I did get quite a few calls from LA representatives after cancelling... \n\nDon't be scared of the long \"Cons\" list (I'm just a little wordy =p). All in all, I didn't leave LA to go to another one. I think most gyms are the same in terms of requiring a 12 month commitment, having an initiation fee and being congested around certain times. I am happy that I didn't feel like they were constantly trying to oversell me. \n\nGiven the quality of the gym, I would definitely recommend it (especially in Brampton, given your options). Plus, I worked at a gym in the past so I'd like to think that I know what I'm talking about... But don't take my word for it-- try it out first on a one-day pass!
