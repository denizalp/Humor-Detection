Costco is always a great choice for your bulk grocery purchases, but if you would rather not crash into an elderly person in the parking lot, DON'T go to this location lol. I can almost guarantee that 80% of the customers there are 65+ years old. Too many times have I witnessed people crash andddd almost crash into each other at this location. They are reckless, they mob uncontrollably and they cannot be trusted there lol.  \n\n*YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED*
