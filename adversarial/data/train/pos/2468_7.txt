I have been driving past Valley Tavern for years. I always thought it looked very interesting because of the surrounding canal and valley area. The building itself looks historic. It is an old converted home. A classic roadhouse type bar that you may find way out in the country away from the commotion of the city. My friend and I were on the way to Gourmands today and decided that we may as well stop into the Valley Tavern. There is a sign hanging up behind the bar of hand drawn testicles with a dollar sign above them. I asked about it and she replied \"Dollar nuts\". They have mostly domestic beer offerings. The food menu is pretty small and focuses on wings, burgers and other fried things. My friend ordered the wings and fried broccoli, cheddar, bacon bites; all of which were awesome. There were very little reasons to go next door to Quaker Steak prior to my visit to the Valley Tavern. I hope to never go to Quaker Steak again. We discussed how lame corporate places are during lunch. Valley Tavern is the antithesis of corporate. This would be the perfect place to stop after watching a movie at the Cinemark at Valley View to fully digest the movie and discuss.
