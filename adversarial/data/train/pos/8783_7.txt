Since we're in the desert, its cool to check out local stores like this where we could catch a glimpse of the ocean with their wide selection of cool saltwater coral and marine life. Sorry, no boring fresh water fishies here....\nThere's your familiar ones like Nemo and Dora, Seahorses and Sea Anemonies, and never before seen ones like an Electric Scallop, and even Hawaii's state fish, the Humu'humu'nuku'nuku'apu'a'a....AKA the Picasso Triggerfish.\n\nThe staff here are very knowledgeable and always around to answer any questions you may have, or even if you're ready to take home a friend. Their reptile section is also cool- snakes, lizards, frogs, tortoises of all shapes and sizes. Stop in if you're in the Hendertucky area. Its a good place to also take the kids!....ALOHA!!!\n\nYELP 100 CHALLENGE 2013-(20\/100) \"Lizards and Fishies\"
