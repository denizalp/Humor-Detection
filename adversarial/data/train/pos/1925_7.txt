Never stayed anywhere but the strip and will always stick to that from now on. Downtown Vegas is the pits. The hotel was very average and parking was near impossible as almost every entrance was sealed off for construction or something. I'd say for $30 it was a good deal except the next day we stayed at the brand new Linq for the exact same price.
