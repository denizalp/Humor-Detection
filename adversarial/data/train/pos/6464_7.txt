Well well well, the mighty fork has roared! \n\nWe had never been here before, but we thought we would try it out for Valentines Day since it was nicer than your average restaurant, but still not too dressy or formal. The whole staff was impeccable, they handed out roses to the ladies as they walked in and the manager and assistant manager went around the restaurant asking people how their meal was and if everything was okay. \n\nOkay, now on to the food! We decided to try the prime rib and Dr. Pepper baby back ribs for our main course and we also got a side of green chili mac and cheese, which we had heard rave reviews about. The prime rib was so tender and juicy and the baby back ribs were sweet and meaty. The ribs came with fries that were nice and crispy and the green chili mac was so tasty and flavorful, definitely a must try. We usually don't finish all of our food when we go out, but the meal was so delicious that we finished every bite on our plates and even licked our fingers clean when we were done! We even managed to stuff down some Huckleberry bread pudding for dessert that was just as amazing as the rest of the meal. I know that we will definitely be coming back here again to try some of the other items on the menu. \n\n4.75\/5
