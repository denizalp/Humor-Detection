Would give this place zero stars if that was an option. My experience. We ordered a couple of their high-end margaritas. When the bartender finished making them together in the same shaker and came up short on one glass what did he do? Make another one then top it off? No he simply topped off the short margarita with triple sec....nice....  two of the same drink, looking completely different, and one tasting terrible.  Did not stick around for more.  Another Shadyside loser.
