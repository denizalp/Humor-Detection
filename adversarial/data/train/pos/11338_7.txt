After losing direction when Cut Hair Studio closed, I used my Yelp savvy investigation skills to track Mandy down at Eddy's on Coventry. (Thanks, Cara!) I'm so glad I could follow her and she ended up even closer to my place, because if I had to change hairstylists again, I would have cried.\n\nIn my growing age, I've become more particular about my hair. I used to dye it whatever color I wanted whenever I wanted and it would be fine, but now that I'm trying to be more of an adult, I've found that spur of the moment dyes aren't my style and are even more risky when I'm starting with fresh natural hair that hasn't been over processed anyways. In the spring, I sprung for a box of blonde dye, which actually ended up looking a lot like what I was expecting and wanted, but as it grew out, I knew something had to be done to fix it. So, I naturally let it go for months upon months and ended up in need of a haircut and color. Mandy knew exactly what I needed when I explained to her what I was going for (I had a wedding to go to the next day and didn't want to look scraggly for it). She gave me perfect lowlights to let my natural color grow out and gave me a great asymmetrical cut (I've had trouble getting what I wanted with the asymmetrical cut--the back is a tricky task, but Mandy did it with ease). \n\nNow that my Mandy praise is out of the way: the salon itself. I've been here a couple of times so far and don't plan on quitting! The staff is super friendly and don't hesitate to include you in on conversations across the salon. They all have a great sense of humor about things and when another stylist compliments something being done on my head instead of just staring at it, I feel really confident that everything is going well up there. \n\nBonus: if you go to Mandy, she does hand and arm massages that will rock your world, then fix up your hair and keep you smiling all day!\n\nAlso, I really like the decor. Very cool and classy.
