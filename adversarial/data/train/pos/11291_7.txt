I thought we would be watching Mariah Carey, but I was mistaken.  Turned out that we were watching Absinthe instead.  Never heard of this show at Caesars Palace.  It takes place at the large tent outside the main entrance to Caesars.  Don't worry, it is air conditioned inside.\n\nHope you have a open sense of humor.  Some of the folks in the audience were offended by some of the jokes.  I thought that many of the jokes were inappropriate, but hilarious at the same time.\n\nOf course, it is more than a profanity laced comedy show.  There are many entertaining acrobats, aerial acts, and other amazing feats taking place close to the audience.  \n\nI would recommend watching Absinthe to most of my friends.  For my more conservative friends, I would tell them to skip it.
