Tired, carrying far too much luggage than a person should carry and trailing around a 22 month old little girl who's been better behaved than some of the the adults on a 3 hour flight from Winnipeg (yeah, you heard, Winnipeg...) our little party, flops onto the airport shuttle (free my arse, built into cost more like) to be whisked away to the luxuries of the awaiting Holiday Inn... it's such a pity that sarcasm can't be detected in written form.\n\nNah, lets be honest and reasonable here, the holiday Inn is what it is, a short term stop for travelers and business folk thats very close to the airport. Yeah its fookin expensive for what it is, but then again, so are most i not all of its nearby competitors. \n\nPros:\n\n- Free(ahem) shuttle to and from the airport, running every 20 mins 24hrs a day... nice\n\n- Friendly staff (my daughter dropped her pink bear.. they didn't laugh or scoff too much when i went to get it back\n\n- Free pool, which  was totally empty when we visited... nice\n\nCons:\n\n- The price\n\n- Stupid drink dispensing area that had me running back and forth from our room; Key card to access, don't take cash (I KNOW!!) and has one of those stupid swipey card readers that as about as temperamental as a Hungarian bus driver...\n\nOverall? good enough...
