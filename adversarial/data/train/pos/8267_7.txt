This review is limited to the concert given by Broadway Tony winner Kelli O'Hara. The Franco Harris auditorium seats about 400-500 people and is reminiscent of Broadway theaters in NY except only much nicer.\n\nKelli won her Tony in 2015 for her portrayal of Anna in the revival of \"the King and I\". She has an outstanding voice and as I guessed it she does sing opera. She is slated to perform at the Met in Lincoln Center later this year.\n\nKelli sang a variety of songs from her various shows including my favorite \"South Pacific.\" I loved how she did the \"man\" roles including Ezio Pinzo's \"This nearly was mine\" with such emotion you could actually want to cry over his loss of Nellie Forbush.\n\nKelli told the story of her life as she moved from the farms of Oklahoma to the bustling city of life of Manhattan. She ran into great notables along the way including the late Marvin Hamlisch whom she dedicated a song to. She also met the grandson of the late Richard Rodgers.\n\nShe does do some composing and one of the songs she had written was spot on! Perhaps the best part of the evening was when she donned a cowboy hat from SW Randall and sang about a country girl resettling in NY and going into labor at the Metropolitan Opera house. She had everyone in stitches!\n\nShe sang at  Sunday's (9-24-17) wedding of Phillipa Soo to Steven Pasquale. Phillipa was the original Eliza Hamilton in the famous musical Hamilton. She rapped in fun a little but it would have been nice to see a rendition of \"Burn\" from her. She sang a tender song at the show's end but was given a callback to sing \"I could have danced all night\" from My Fair Lady.\n\nThis concert held at the August Wilson Center enable me to see only a little of the ground floor but was a different venue for the series Trust Cabaret series. The show was excellent and was glad I had the opportunity to see her perform live in concert.
