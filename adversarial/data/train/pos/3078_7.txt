Mind-boggling and enormous operation. \n\nMy boyfriend's parents moved to Scottsdale recently and we went the day after Thanksgiving. \n\nThe value here beyond all conception: \n\n1) Tahari highest-end designer, Arthur Levine plum blazer, 46 but on sale for 23. That's gotta be a 400 dollar blazer or perhaps 300 minus skirt. \n\n2) Cashmere blend overcoat with real fox trim: 99. \n\n3) Pizzi dress: 99, reminiscent of old Carole Little. \n\n4) Old but fine condition shearling coat: 25. People probably thought it was fake. For days when cashmere won't cut it and you don't own a parka.\n\n5) Bruno Magli like new one-inch pumps (patent\/suede) for Mom for Christmas, 50 but 25 after TG. \n\nIf you are into fur but think it's wrong to buy NEW fur: THIS IS THE PLACE TO COME\n\nNow, why North Scottsdale moneyed matrons need fur is beyond me. But these women may travel a lot and want to wear in NYC or wherever when they leave Scottsdale in the winter. \n\nThey're so nice there too! If you're not from Scottsdale, you should be prepared for a lot of seriously skinny women with some very impressive chests. This cannot all be natural but you should be prepared because it's hard not to stare on occasion. Also, lots of sparkles in Scottsdale on the distaff population as my friend says: jeans, sweaters, tops, sandals, shoes.... \n\nI don't know what this Funnyone F is talking about. This is THE MOST chill consignment store! She needs to come to LA and NYC and find out what snotty really looks like. And it's hard to be intimidated by frosted blonde hair in banana clips --ubiquitous in the store--so I'm quite perplexed by this comment.\n\nP.S. I just reread Funnyone's trashing of this store. (She's only funny in the \"laugh at you\" not \"laugh with you\" sense, by the way.)\n\nMy God! If they were rude to her maybe it's her retro-1960s social justice persona. Oy vey. I walk around ALMOST all places (even Manhattan in the snow to get breakfast) in PJs, with my hair a major mess and no makeup at all with beat-up comfort \/ortho French wedges. I am treated well most of the time in those get-ups in places far snottier than uber-friendly North Scottsdale. \n\nTo be fair, I am at all times seriously decked out in bling (white gold, lab created stones from Diamond Nexus, not CZ but not mined). She might invest in some CZ which might fool these women she claims are treating her badly. Or she might get a better personality. Or a hobby. If she has time to conduct this experiment with dressing up and dressing down--TWICE--she has too much free time on her hands.  \n\nNEWSFLASH: We live in a class-conscious society. Anyone who thinks America is less classist than Britain is delusional. And for the record, YES, they can treat you badly if they choose. We live in a free enough society with a free enough market that proprietors can treat you however they like.
