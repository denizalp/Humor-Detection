Love coming here for a nice meal!\nThe perfect place to go for a date or fancy dinner with friends and family!\n\nThe meal sets are always a good choice so I would recommend going with those instead of ordering single dishes.\n\nI'm pescatarian, so I usually get their sea bass which is DA. BOMB. For real, you actually have to go try it because it's basically heaven inside your mouth.\n\nThe service is very nice and I can sit here for hours without ever feeling rushed to leave! The only complaint I have is that it can be hard to wave down a server sometimes.\n\nThere's really nothing much to say but just TRY THE SEA BASS. TRUST :')
