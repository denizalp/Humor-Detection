Once again, I came back here for breakfast before my flight home.  Still a great deal for breakfast at $15.  I was a little distraught when I couldn't find their stash of eggs benedicts, but after about 10 mins, they brought them out and I was in eggs benedict bliss!  It was great way to top off my trip!
