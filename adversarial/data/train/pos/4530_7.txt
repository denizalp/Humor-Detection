I never followed America's Best Dance Crew but was accustomed to hearing the hype surrounding the Jabbawockeez. I was able to snag free tickets to this show - who can say no to a) free tickets and b) a show so highly rated on Yelp? Overall, I enjoyed this show. I imagine that actual fans would appreciate the show even more.\n\nThe Jabbawockeez's new home is at the MGM inside a small unassuming theater. Entry to the theater is located inside the Jabbawockeez gift shop. The theater itself is a no frills theater with the only 'special effects' being a good projector. I really don't think there was bad seat in the house, but I'd opt for something towards the back to avoid being picked on. The new show is called 'Dreamz' centered on a plot, where, you guessed it, the plot revolves around a dream. The hour long show is 75% dancing and the rest is comprised of slapstick comedy and audience participation. The soundtrack was a nice mix of new hip hop music with old school rap. And the volume was fine BTW. \n\nThe most members on stage at at time was maybe 6 or 7 people. I was confused because I thought the Jabbawockeez were a much larger group. At the end of the show, more people came out. Where were they hiding lol? Anyways, my favorite part of the show was the super cool black light\/Street Fighter skit. My least favorite was when a girl from the audience was dragged on stage for a skit that lasted entirely too long. I kind of felt bad for her. There were 2 other audience skits that were a lot less painful to watch (and quite funny). \n\nTo wrap things up, I had a smile plastered on my face the entire show. I'd encourage fans to attend.\n\nYELP 100 CHALLENGE 2015: #256
