How have I never reviewed this place? Oh wait. I know. Because I don't want all you Old Town Douchers crowding my spot. \n\nI love this place so much. It's a definite escape from the regular Old Town bars. I def feel a lot more classy when i walk into this joint...as in I'm not going to get my ass grinded on by some fool sweatin out his molly. \n\nThey have great drinks. The bartenders, excuse me I mean, Mixologists know their stuff. I decided recently that I love gin. And they have such an amazing gin cocktail. It's called the Goule. There's fresh basil in it. bomb.com. Have a few of those in a night. Be careful, they go down real easy but they pack a punch. \n\nI haven't had a full on meal here - just a bunch of shared apps and drinks and that's more than enough to keep this girl happy. The grilled cheese has prosciutto. Winning. \n\nSo there's a secret room in the back where the book case is. I haven't been in there and I feel like I'd look a little silly tugging on all the books trying to figure out which one opens the secret door, but get enough Goule's in me and I might just do it. I know you can rent it out privately which I'm sure could be a real good time. Could get a lil weird. But I don't hate it.
