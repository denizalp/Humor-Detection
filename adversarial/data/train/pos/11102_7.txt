Scoop is a tiny shop with a random anime\/ video game theme going on. Based on other Yelp reviews, it seems as though they are primarily an ice cream shop but also sell boba and food items. \n\nI got an Oreo macaron ice cream sandwich with green tea ice cream and a small milk tea with boba. The Oreo macaron in the display case looked tasty, but upon receiving my order the macaron I was given looked nothing like the display. There were tiny crumbs of Oreo baked into the macaron but none on top. Not a big deal, but when I asked about it, the worker said, \"oh, they must have forgotten to sprinkle the Oreo on top.\" Ohhhhkay. Texture-wise, it was kind of hard with a flat sugary flavor. The green tea ice cream had no green tea flavor, and was melted. \n\nThe boba was cheap- $2.50 for a small. The milk tea itself was decent. Some other Yelpers mentioned that their tapioca was hard, though the ones I got were overly soft and tasteless. Cheap, yes, but unfortunately you get what you pay for. \n\nI feel as though Scoop is a good concept that suffers from excessive menu items and poor execution. Maybe instead of offering dozens of things, they should pick a few and do them well. Don't really have a reason to return.
