This was my 2nd trip. The first was uninspiring but I thought I would give it a 2nd chance. I specifically wanted a lunch buffet. This time, the buffet selection was paltry with barely a handful of main\/side dishes. The food was fine my first trip but the price (increased from $11 to $13) was a deal breaker. Egg rolls? What part of India did egg rolls come from?\n\n\"Mount Everest\" on Sahara has a phenomenal buffet! And it's $11.
