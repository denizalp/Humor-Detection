You know this place isn't bad. The pho is fresh, tasty and what you would expect for the prices you pay. It's cheap and the value is high as a result. Now it's not close to a homemade authentic pho experience, but i you compare it to pho 88 or pho xelua, then this place does pho justice.\n\nThe service is terrible and you are only ever allowed one napkin per person. So use your napkins sparingly and make sure only to dab on them every now and then. for big messes, use your sock instead.
