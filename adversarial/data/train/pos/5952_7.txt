I am very dissatisfied... Sorry but I took my dog to a different clinic, Sahara animal hospital,  and they told me exactly what is wrong with him. \n\nHe has bulging disks, this hospital took x-Rays and so did the Sahara animal hospital but the only one who helped and gave him cortisone was the hospital at Sahara.
