I am from California and had been going to the same hair stylist for 5 years. My hair is naturally dirty blonde & I typically do a full foil so that I can be a really light shade of blonde. \nWhen I called I tried to make an appointment and find someone who would fit well with what I wanted to do. The women I spoke to on the phone seemed busy and I felt very rushed. I explained my kind of hair and what I was hoping to do and asked who she would recommend. She recommended a girl named Katie. She told me \"she is really good with blondes.\"\nSo I came in ready to go with several pictures and ideas. Katie seemed like a nice girl and she was extremely confident in her skills.\nI showed her 2 pictures of blonde ombres. One of the photos had a caramel base and platinum blonde by the tips, I told her that the picture shown still needed more of the platinum color in the back, so blonde.\nI showed her a picture of Lauren Conrad where she had a very short deep redish brown root fading into platinum blonde. I told her that my hair would turn yellow over time and that I wanted the blonde to lean towards a white shade not a yellow shade.\nShe assured me that we were on the same page.\nShe put an extremely dark looking dye from the root of my hair to the area right above my hair. \nI started getting nervous and kept telling her that I don't want to be dark, that I want to be blonde, that I don't really take chances with my hair. She assured me that she was just darkening the root and base and adding a few low lights and that it would be a beautiful blonde sombre.\nShe hardly added even a single highlight on my head.She says that my old hair lady was over processing my hair & it was really damaged on the ends. she said it needed a trim, I didn't realize she was going to cut 3-4 inches off, because I would have said no. My hair used to be at my armpit, now it's slightly longer than shoulder length. \nShe was so nice that I didn't want to hurt her feelings. I considered that maybe she did what I wanted -- I mean she did say \"it looks exactly like the picture\" so maybe I was just self conscious about not doing my regular thing. \nSince she was so desperately convincing me that my hair was damaged & needed new products I bought some. When I told her that I already used good products and said that I use the moisture intense repair line from Alterna Caviar ($32 - 8oz bottle) she had apparently never heard of it? With a tip, the products, & my services I paid almost $400. Not to mention it's over a half an hour drive each way to the salon and I was there for about 2-3 hours.\nI took some pictures of it & just hated it. My boyfriend said I was still beautiful but that it didn't look good. When I got him my roommate said \"I thought you were getting your hair done today?\"\nShe basically turned me into a brunette & she toned my blonde so that it looked grey & my whole head just looked ashy brown. It made me look 8 years older, I'm only 21. It washed me out & made me look even more pale. It was so horrible that I didn't even go out in public or look into mirrors because I was so unhappy.\nWhen I left she told me the dark would fade & that she could \"pop in a few more highlights of I wanted.\"\nI made it clear to the person making my appointment that it's wouldn't be 3 highlights, it is a full foil, no brown, I just want to be platinum white blonde. She assured me it would be free.\nWhen I get there, Katie said she was confused because she thought I \"loved it\" & it looked \"exactly like the picture.\"\nShe kept using phrases like fall look and softer blonde. Then she says \"that's okay, you wanted to try something new but it just wasn't for you.\"\nShe said that she can add a few highlights in for free, but if I want more she has to charge me ANOTHER $70 because she \"would have to reverse everything she already did.\"\nAs if becoming an ashy brunette was what I asked for.\nI say fine. I want a FULL FOIL, as blonde as possible & I want all the dark out.\nShe says okay I will do the best I can without damaging your hair.\nSo I watch her do my foil and see her dividing the hair into teeny strands like I wanted very subtle highlights. So by the end of the 2nd appt, my hair was dark blonde - apparently platinum full foil is not a standard term most can understand? Katie said that it will take multiple sessions to get back to my old shade.. thanks for waiting till after your done for that? I also found a bleach drop on my hair. The reception wouldn't allow me to return the $100 in shampoo i bought except for store credit which I wasn't allowed to use on my services. I left in tears, so mad I literally broke out into a rash. I called & told them how I felt, & got a semi rude woman who said she would give me back the $70 & let me bring back the shampoo. However, now my hair is extremely damaged\/dry & I have to use an expensive hair mask daily. Now I have to look & pay for another stylist. They did the bare minimum to rectify the situation. What a waste.
