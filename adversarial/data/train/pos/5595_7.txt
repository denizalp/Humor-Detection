This was my family's second year in a row at Cartwright's for Thanksgiving and it was very good again.  I rated it 4 stars this time instead of 5 for a few reasons.  Since we had a specific Thanksgiving menu I can't really compare to all the complaints I have since read here but I can understand most of them.  Not serving a baked potatoe in a steakhouse is pretty ridiculous and two in my party were disappointed with that.  Also, last year they had the most fantastic pumpkin puree appetizer and this year there was something wrong with it - sort of bitter.  The mashed potatoes may be Idahoan instants out of the package.  This year an alternate entree choice was salmon, and my husband's was perfect.  Another choice (last year's was prime rib) was sirloin steak and two were served over-cooked but they instantly replaced them with ones cooked perfect.   The side dish with that was a skillet of diced roasted potatoes and veggies that seemed to me like something from Denny's.  I have to send cudos to our server, Julie; she handled our party of six perfectly and was charming and funny.  So, yeah, I'm still a fan but if this place is under new management and they're trying to squeeze more profit out of it, they better figure out this isn't the way to do it, or Cartwright's won't be around much longer.
