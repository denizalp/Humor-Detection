Overall great place for craft project items, home decor or holiday\/seasonal decor.  They usually have a sale on a rotation of items otherwise use the weekly 40% off coupon for one item.  If not some items seem over priced. Most of the time there is a line for check out so be prepared to be patient. Great variety of items of all variety.  Usually I lose time looking around and could spend hours there.
