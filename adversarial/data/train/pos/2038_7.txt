Reviewing their food for the first time at their new restaurant location in far north phoenix (Deer Valley Airport only USED TO be the boonies), but i've been hearing about their meat for some time now.\n\nA delicious smoky aroma gently smacks you around and lulls you into submission once you enter.  A simple menu offers the lunch selection (soon to offer breakfast too). I knew i wanted pulled pork as an entree, and honestly didn't notice what else they had.  \n\nThe usual side offerings of beans, potato salad, and coleslaw never appeal to me, personally.  I don't fault them for that, but a pickle spear being my only other available side left me feeling less than satiated.  Maybe some french fries, or at least chips?  \n\nThe pulled pork sandwich had a nice smoky flavor, and the meat was juicy without being fatty.  The bun was simply generic.  Maybe these guys could get into cahoots with a local baker to put their special meat on something a little more worthy?  \n\nThe sauces offered were \"Sweet Mild\" (which was both) and \"Hog Wild Hot\" (which was neither, but still tasty).  Both had a distinct molasses sweetness in a thick tomatoey base, the Hot with a little more spice flavor to it, but not much heat at all.\n\nThe atmosphere is simple and clean.  Ribs, breakfast, and \"Swine & Dine\" nights are on the way, according to the owners.\nLook forward to many more days of coming back to work smelling like a meat smoker !
