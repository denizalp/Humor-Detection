It's hard to even imagine that what was once at Rose.Rabbit.Lie was even really, really, real reality.  On a recent visit, when my first time friends asked to explain what kind of stuff went on a couple of years back, I kind of blew my own mind rattling off the random shit my wife and I had seen.  From Piff the Magic Dragon's Vegas debut to the guy that could fit his whole body through tennis rackets to the grumpy female custodian that would sweep the floors all night until 1am where she then randomly stripped off all her clothes save for panties and pasties to start dancing like a maniac.  How exactly was that role worded in the job description?\n\nI've been pretty averse to going back since Spiegelworld and Vegas Nocturne left the building and took all their toys with them over a year ago.  I feel grateful to had seen what I did for the brief time it was around.  That's not to say it's a bad time in its current incarnation, there's still an entertaining evening to be had.  But an exciting venture down a rabbit hole it is not.  This is a cool restaurant with great acts of song and dance between tasty bites and a solid cocktail menu.\n\nThe food has gone pretty much unchanged since they opened, which is totally fine with me. It's still creative, delicious and very fitting with the modern supper club vibe.  Caviar flatbread topped with bacon and thyme was an excellent way to start the meal.  Salty and rich, just like the singer who planted a big kiss on my cheek as she commented on my choice of hairstyle.\n\nThe seared foie gras and plum mostarda went nicely in that fatty and fruity way.  Duck confit pasta with its wonderful pieces of fowl and light parmesan cream sauce would definitely be something I would get again.  Our group also enjoyed the \"modern\" beef stroganoff, the perfectly grilled Hokkaido sea scallops, and the crazy \"Chocolate Terrarium\" dessert.  I'd gladly go back for more, just with lowered expectations.
