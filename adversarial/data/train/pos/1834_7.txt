Of all the Samurai Sam's in the Valley, I like this one the best.  For some reason the chicken is always so much better here - I don't know why but its seriously better here.  I really like the manager guy who is always there (can't remember his name) he always remembers what I order and asks me how business is going.  I really like when chain restaurants aren't so commercial.
