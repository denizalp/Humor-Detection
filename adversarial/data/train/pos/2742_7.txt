I found this place one day while waiting for my food at Dragon Palace.  I am not the nerdy toy buff and collector type, but this place is fun.  Lots of fine new and vintage toys starting at $1.00.\n\nI was able to find some great Star Wars toys for my son as well as some classics including The Beatles Yellow Submarine.  In addition, plenty of Marvel and DC Comic based items.\n\nThe store is open from 11:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. Wednesday through Saturday.  It can be a challenge to find open.\n\nThe staff is helpful and knowledgeable.  \n\nFrom my experience the customers are truly originals!  My first time in the store an Elvis impersonator told my four year old that he is pushy and rude.  I will leave it at that..........\n\nSome of the toys are from McDonald's\/Burger King which is a good thing.  I would rather get my son the toy here than go to the fast food h*ll and pay double to have some unedible food type items in a card board box.\n\nIf you are around the area, check it out.  Even if you are not into toys, this place will likely bring up some position memories of yesterday.
