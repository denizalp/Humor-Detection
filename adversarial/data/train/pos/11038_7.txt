I have been pacing for months in California anticipating a trip where we would be able to dine at one of the most sought after reservations in Vegas.  Alas our time had come.\n\nWe arrived 15 minutes early for our 10:15 dinner reservation.  We were assured our table would be ready at the time reserved, while being ushered to the lounge.  \n\nThe lounge decor was gray walls with random spots of color and 'artwork'.  A bear's head in a plexi-glass case to the right of the fireplace, but nothing on the other side to balance it out.  The bar had tens of thousands of dollars of brandy bottles along with a red model racing car that had no significance whatsoever.  We asked one of the servers if the chef had ties to Nascar, no such thing.\n\nOur bartender was a stunning young woman from Australia.  Nicole Kidman, but in a good way.  After our $20 champagne cocktails were delivered, she disappeared and was never seen again.  \n\nHer replacement came in the form of an older French gentleman.  He busied him at the 6 seat bar area, smiled at us and shortly after presented some complimentary treats: the most minuscule burgers and fois gras sandwiches we've ever seen.  Every morsel was scrumptious, it only amped me up even more for the dinner looming ahead.  \n\nThe French guy made time for the bf as he hoarded him with questions about the formation of brandy.  He obliged and was very patient and pleasant during his explanation.  \n\nWe moved down from the bar stools to the lounge chairs.  Some more time was passed with their coffee table book \"Champagnes of the World.\"  \n\n10:25, French guy was trying to distract us from the fact that we were still not being seated, so he brought over more of the mini burgers and the sandos.  \n\nAt 10:35, my patience had waned and I was really getting sick of staring at the gray walls, and at this point we were whisked away to our table in another gray room, but this one had a window to the strip.  The bf mentioned our four table room as no different from a racketball court.  \n\nPrivacy was obviously minimal.  If anyone spoke louder than a whisper, the other 3 parties would know precisely each muttering being divulged.  \n\nA bread cart is used here, but they first bring you their mass produced bread.  Maybe to fill you up, so you don't eat the more quality bread on the cart?  \n\nI usually depend on the bf to finish what I cannot, but the night at Savoy, the bf refused.  Gasp!!!  This is a rare event.  He was not pleased with the food.  \n\nI honestly enjoyed the complimentary portions of the meal the most.  \n\nMany of the courses were stifled by the drowning of creamy sauces that were added after the dish had arrived.  \n\nAmuse bouche:\nDuck consomme with a duck pastry.  Absolutely delicious.  The soup had a faint duck flavor and the pastry was fluffy.  \n\nCaviar creme\nThe four layers were attractive to look at, but the flavor was too creamy, not intense enough.  Even the saltiness of the caviar did not penetrate the rest of the dish.\n\nPea soup\nAgain, bland.  I did enjoy the creme fraiche.\n\nAhi two ways\nSeared ahi, basic, but drowning in sesame oil.  \n\nHalibut\nGorgeous cut of fish.  Pearlescent pink.  The beet was a nice contrast.  The fish was very delicate, but boring.  The texture was similar to sashimi and was surprising since it was posing as cooked.  The flavors were uncomplicated, because it tasted like it was marinated with salt.  Broth was poured over the fish after arriving to the table.\n\nLobster\nNothing out of the ordinary, but again the presentation was good.  Again, the showy pouring of broth was added.\n\nBlack truffle soup\nThis soup was creamy and decadent.  Quite good.  The fresh shavings of Parmesan were a nice kick to the soup.\n\nDuck\nGood, but the flavors were not as intense as I would have liked them.  Duck jus was added.\n\nSorbet, raspberries and white chocolate\nGorgeously crafted, but disappointing.  I just picked out the raspberries.  \n\nA petit four cart is wheeled to the table at the end of the meal and upon leaving the lady is handed a SMALL box of chocolates.  \n\nWhile ULing the pics, I realized how much seafood and TWO soup courses!?!?!\n\nService was good and unobtrusive throughout the evening.  Especially the French guy in the lounge and the bathroom attendant.  \n\nWhen at the bar, the French guy asked if we would be dining with them that evening POST mini burgers and sandos, if I had known, I would have gobbled the FREE treats, downed the cocktails, licked my chops and hightailed it outta there.
