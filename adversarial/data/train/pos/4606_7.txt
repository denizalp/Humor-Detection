Came here for pre-dinner appetizers!\n\nMoscow Mules - Delicious, and delightfully gingery.\n\nDuck Spring Rolls -\nThe manager said this was a must, so a must we must have :) I could have eaten about 5 more! Even those who do not like duck....admitted defeat to the tasty spring rolls.\n\nGreen Chile Verde -\nBeen hunting for this all around town. SO good!\n\n1842 Nachos -\nToo full to try, but I heard, they're the best nacho's someone has had in their life! They also come out in gigantic servings like on a cookie sheet!\n\nCoconut Cake -\nI didn't even get to try this because SOMEONE ate it all and didn't pass it down.
