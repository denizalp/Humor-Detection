Yo, this Ty Cobb, Tommy Lee Jones salad is THE SHIT. I haven't tried anything else because I just can't pass it up... Be sure to get it spicy, with the mad spice avocado.\n\nDon't fall for the larger size, the regular is definitely enough to fill you up.\n\nThere's a lot of \"Scottsdale\" at this location, but so what? Healthy, fast(casual) food... Go figure!
