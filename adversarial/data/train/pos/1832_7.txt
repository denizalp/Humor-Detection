I will always remember the remarkable enthusiasm and energy displayed from  Amber,  our server!  She was super friendly and catering when informing us that they will customize any items on their menu.  With that said, I was able to try a sugar free chocolate cookie dough iced coffee!  The link sausages were a star being fresh, tender and not overly greasy!  The chorizo hash didn't shine so much for us but their blueberry pancakes with warm homemade compote was scrumptious!  In fact, I was told that I stated a few times, how tasty the blueberries and pancakes were!  \n\nI love non-chain places!   You can feel the warm, inviting family atmosphere that Mark, Amber and  Amber's husband naturally create.   The mood is contagious and you can tell the patrons leave with a full stomach and smile on their face!  I will return for more...... of both!!
