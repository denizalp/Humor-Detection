DaYaLi Beijing Roast Duck is a chain from China. Came in a group of 5, and they told us that they don't have tables for 5 and that we had to squeeze into a table for 4. I assume they didn't want to waste a table for 6 (round table) on us and rather seat us at a table for 4. \n\nWe came here at 6:30 on a Thursday night and had to wait about 20 minutes. Wasn't too bad, and somewhat expected. Given that it's a mainland China chain, there were alot of people from mainland china here. Lots of mandarin, very little canto. Servers first reaction is to speak in mandarin...not canto and definitely not english. \n\nYou're able to purchase a membership (which I believe is $20). Members pay discounted prices. Otherwise the non-member prices are generally $1 or $2 more per dish. Seems like its only worth it if you come often. \n\nWe ordered 8 dishes for 5 people and it WAY was more than enough food. \n\nWe got the regular order of the peking duck and not the fancier version. I think the main differences are (1) more condiments (e.g. grapes, etc.) and (2) the wrappers are heated by a candle. The peking duck was very good and was the highlight of the meal. \n\nOrdered a bunch of different things. All of which were disappointing: \n- Fried grated potatoes...which weren't fried and basically boiled and soaked in soy sauce\n- Spicy chicken was okay. Essentially like popcorn chicken. \n- Baked pumpkin was not crispy at all. Very soggy. \n- Steamed soup dumplings were packed into a tin steamer and not that good \n- Scallion pancakes were decent \n\nWould say duck was a 4, other dishes are 1-2. Service is 2.... so overall 3 seems a little bit generous. If I were to come back again, I would just get duck.
