If you're just skimming, bottom line; Joshua Lambert is great.\nI have had so many appalling doctors that admittedly my bar is not set high; by which I mean my ferret could step over it with his tiny legs. (And he's fat- sorry, sorry; he doesn't like that term- \"husky\"- which means the bar has to pretty much be on the actual ground.) Truly, so many- to the point I had given up on finding a decent psychiatrist- the last one literally stalked me. (I mean actually stalked; not like some people use that term to mean far lesser things.)\nAs a result, you can imagine I needed someone REALLY good to be able to say I trust them, that I think they're a great doctor, to say that I actually defer to him on my doses and how to take my medication- something he has proved not merely capable but excellent at. (Needless to say, I was previously \"self medicating\", but I feel that's understandable with the context of what my previous psychiatrist was like.)\nReally, Joshua Lambert is great- he's a great doctor and I believe a great guy. He's knowledgeable, friendly and he's someone you can trust- both to give you accurate information and advice, adjusting your medications responsibly and putting your health and wellbeing first, and also not to weirdly stalk you, which I feel like must have happened to more people than just me.\nKnowledgeable: 10\/10\nFriendly: 10\/10\nNot-being-a-stalker: 10\/10\nWaiting time: 10\/10\nStaff: 10\/10\n\nPS: Nice office, good location, Dawn on the desk is great- just fabulous eyeliner; which is from Stilla (I think that's the spelling) for anyone who'd like to know but didn't think to ask- and my wait time has yet to be more than a couple of minutes and is regularly before I've even sat down. You won't regret going here.\n\nPPS: A quick update- Joshua Lambert recently helped me switch to a different anxiety medication, and while the starting dose is too low (as is often the case, obviously drugs like this must be stepped up slowly and with caution) for me, I am already finding it more beneficial than my old medication. I had accepted a certain moderate level of anxiety in my life as just how it is, but for the first time in 16 years I'm actually seeing it may very well be eased greatly with the right help. I wish I could up my rating based on this, but I can't, so I'll just restate that this guy really is a great, warm, caring, smart, knowledgeable doctor who is very good and reliable at medication management and a truly welcome, and most appreciated, change from the many psychiatrists who force a patient to take a dozen different weaker alternatives before providing a drug that is clearly more appropriate for that individual.\n\nPPPS: Upon trying the aforementioned eyeliner for myself I can confirm it's fantastic and withstands even my insomniac periods lasting a couple of days at a time. I can't pull off the colors she can, but I'm happy to have a nice, reliable black one based on her input :-)\n\nUpdate on March 15, 2018:\nI've now been seeing Joshua Lambert for about 9 months and just wanted to write a quick update to say he remains the absolute best psychiatrist I've ever seen; if my other doctors were a fraction as compassionate, competent, knowledgeable and just willing to listen to their patients to address their health concerns instead of rushing them out without proper treatment, (an event that happened to me recently with a GP of this nature left me dangerously ill,) I would be indescribably happy; as I am that I wound up a patient here. I remain so thankful every month that even when other doctors fall so woefully short of what one hopes for when unwell and seeking help, I can at least rely on Joshua to be continually reliable, kind and prescribe me medication that does exactly what it should for my anxiety, depression and PTSD. He has never tried to change doses when the current dose appears to be working well, he's never put me on medication I don't need, and he's always been sympathetic to my other health concerns.\n\nThe bottom line; I really can't encourage anyone reading this more strongly to visit Joshua Lambert if they need a psychiatrist. You're unlikely to ever find anyone even half as good, but certainly you cannot find anyone better; I wish everyone who is in need of help with their illness could experience such a high quality of care.
