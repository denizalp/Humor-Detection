I am a chocolate freak & LOVE CREPES!\nUsually, I try to avoid LV strip because of the traffics on the road (especially during the holiday weekends-.-;;;).  But I've been craving for good crepes for a while, this time I had to go & eat it no matter what. I was driving to Paris HTL &  it was on July 4th wknd, haha!\n There I was ordering \"Nutella\".. Soooo Tasty!!!  A great amount of warm chocolate hazelnut melted down on the plate, finished with whipping cream & powder sugar, Amazing Amazing!,  \nI was very satisfied.
