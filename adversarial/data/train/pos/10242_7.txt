So I tried to change the address on yelp but it couldn't get verified... so I guess I'll say it on here:\n\n3655 W. Sunset Road Ste. D\n(Next to the big DHL sign)\n\nI circled around for 30min looking for the location it says on the yelp site but saw that it was closed lol.\nAnyways, on to the good stuff!! Guy at front desk was very nice. A group of my friends and I came on a Saturday evening and the price was $5\/person. I think the price is higher if you come before 5pm. You can bring your own badminton racquets or you can just rent them for free. There are boxes of birdies for you to smack at all over the courts so no need to bring your own. There are 8 courts total overall and also plenty of seating. When we went, there were barely any people but I think all the pros come in at around 7pm and they tend to take up most of the courts. Overall, great place to get a good work out or even to join the club!
