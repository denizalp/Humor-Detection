Well... this place has lost it's luster for me. Everything that used to taste high quality and fresh tastes just okay now. The sushi isn't that great anymore. The habachi just isn't the same.\n\nWhat happened? Did I change? Did this place change? I think it's a little of both. Maybe I can compare it to a relationship. Yes, that's it. Things were awesome at first. We were in love and everything was just perfect. The sushi was fantastic and fresh. The habachi was so delicious I wanted to lick my plate.\n\nThen over time things started to deteriorate. The sushi didn't taste like my beloved Penn Ave Fish, my new amore. The habachi was missing something. Did the soup recipe change? Not as much flavor. Did the portions get smaller. Where did my sprouts go?! Things started to head south...\n\nThe last straw was the whole atmosphere or Club Nakama we'll call it. The music is pulsating techno. The crowd is judge-y. The service is lacking. And the food, it's nothing special. Sad, because what once was, is no more:(\n\nIt's time to break-up. We had a good run. We may run into each other once in a while and be friendly, but for now, it's time we take a break. Might be for good this time. You never know....
