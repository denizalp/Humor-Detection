The Munch Box is absolutely the perfect place to eat a delicious breakfast or lunch. The atmosphere is so comfy and cozy; I was surprised when I walked in to see a small seating area and an area next to it for cooking where you can watch your meal be made. The staff that works here is extremely friendly and welcoming. Im a vegetarian and when I go out it's usually hard to find yummy options. I tried the avocado grilled cheese sandwich and I basically went to food utopia. It was so delicious. It was full of delicious pepper jack cheese as well as a heap of yummy avocado. I would highly recommend this place to anyone with good taste in restaurants!
