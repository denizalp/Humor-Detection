Cucina Italiana is the coffee house and pastry shop offshoot of Il Fornaio. They are not open in the evening. \n\nI had a decent cafe mocha here and a blueberry scone that was really a muffin in scones clothing. They offer the standard lineup of coffee house drinks, assorted pastries and a few salads and sandwiches. \n\nThe interior is nice and goes for a Manhattan coffee house look or something. Jazz and standards play loudly over the sound system.
