Went in for an oil change and they stated to my husband and I we needed new breaks and rotors. My father taught me a lot about cars in addition they never took the tires off to check this. I had the lock for the lug nuts and I watched them. Instead he showed me this little tool that \"supposedly measures this\". Usually when Meineke recommends extra repairs they place it on the receipt, but they didn't for the breaks and rotors which made it even more suspicious. I went home and examined the breaks myself and I have about 3 to 6 months more life on my breaks (depending on mileage) and my rotors were never compromised. FRAUD is happening here and management good luck on weeding them out or if it is management your business will ultimately not be successful. Also the first time I called I was hung up on when I asked for the manager, then anytime you call for a manager they all claim to be the manager. They also did a simple oil change and didn't tighten my air filter and oil top properly. I can't imagine their work on something more complicated such as a break job.\n\nOn 12-30-15 we replaced our brakes, just as I had predicted. Rotors were fine. This place should be monitored\nBy corporate for fraud.
