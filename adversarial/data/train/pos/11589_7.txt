Why does Nando's rock? For one, the crispy, juicy deliciousness of the chicken. But more importantly, the sauce. I have thought about drinking it. You can buy it at some grocery stores and once I bought the entire stock (9 bottles) because it was on sale. It's that good. Even though the chicken is pre-sauced, you'll probably end up pouring tons on during the meal. Addictive stuff with a citrus flavor and a nice heat that isn't too overwhelming even at the extra hot.\n\nHere's how it works: Pick out which kinds of chicken you want (half\/full chicken, wings, or skewers in any combination) the spiciness level of the chicken from mild to extra hot (you can do half and half on any order) and your sides. Then you get a number and sit down and they'll bring your food to you.\n\nIf you like spicy, flavorful chicken, this is as good as it gets. By the way, the reviews below about the veggie options totally miss the mark. The name of the place is Nando's Flame Grilled CHICKEN. I can appreciate not eating meat, but don't judge a place for options it only provides as a last resort for those who would otherwise not be able to eat anything while their meat eating friends are dining. The price is right and you get pretty decent portions. For 27 bucks we got enough food for two men and one woman.
