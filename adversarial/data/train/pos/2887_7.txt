The other reviewers are right, this Sbux kind of sucks. There's not enough seating for the crowds and though there are a good number of workers none of them appeared to be doing much work. \n\nI ordered an iced tea and watched as multiple orders for people that arrived after me were served up. How hard is it to dump ice and premade tea in a cup? \n\nThe restroom was beyond gross - the sink was so filthy I almost wanted to skip washing my hands (but I didn't because we live in a society, people). I did a post-wash sanitize though. \n\nThis location is a definite nope for me.
