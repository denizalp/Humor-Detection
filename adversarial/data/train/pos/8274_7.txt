Been ordering here for years. Not that good to be honest but quick and hot. Tough meats and crummy quality proteins but hey, those cats and stray dogs don't cook themselves. The delivery guy used to break his neck \"casing\" out my apartment while i signed the bill. I order from Fujo now like an adult with money.
