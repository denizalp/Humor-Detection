I typically come to Vegas once a year, and I've stayed at New York, New York many times. I stay here because the hotel prices are good for an average hotel. My two stars are here for several reasons:\n\n1) The hotel rooms are hit or miss. Sometimes, I get a great room that is extremely comfortable and very clean. Other times, I have to ask for another room because the room isn't clean or there is a problem with the plumbing or air conditioner. \n\n2) It is so difficult to fine cocktail servers on the casino floor. I've taken to going and buying a bottle of booze and just taking my flask with me so I don't have to rely on a server. That's kind of sad given that I know the casino wants me sitting in one spot with money to burn.\n\n3) The casino is small in comparison to other casinos around it. MGM and Monte Carlo, for example, are both massive. Mandalay Bay is not too far, and it is huge. New York, New York could stand to do some improvements in the casino, move out some of the overpriced restaurants, and turn that area into some more casino space\n\nThose things said, I do like the fact that there is an arcade and coaster in the hotel. Keep in mind that the coaster is expensive to ride. It would be nice if NY, NY included it in the resort fee and charged those not staying in the hotel. I like the fact that the hotel is so close to the new park and new stadium.\n\nI think the hotel\/casino has a lot going for it, but it needs some updates and some customer service care.
