In the weird, desolateness that is this area of Phoenix, there's this small little block with cute restaurants and bars.  We wandered in on New Year's Day and were pleased to see that they were open.  \n\nWe ordered beer and easily settled into hanging out here for quite a while. The waitress was friendly and helpful and even agreed to turn off the football game and crank up the tunes.  We had the sausage roll, which was awesome with the beer.\n\nMade me wish I could transport this place to SF.
