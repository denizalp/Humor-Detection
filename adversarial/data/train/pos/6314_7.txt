Greg is the type of dude who throws a killer party, but doesn't know when enough is enough. Listen Greg, everyone loves to come over and chill out with a keg, okay, bro? Everyone is super impressed that you can have 36 Natty Lights without throwing up, Greg. No, really. There's a time and a place for you, man. That time and that place is college or post-college hangs. Don't throw yourself in a suit, put some junk in your hair, speak a little lower, shake hands a little firmer and pretend we're good buddies all of a sudden. You're Kegger Greg, damn it. And that's the only relationship I want with you.\n\nPizza Hut? You're fine if I'm broke or drunk. You're Kegger Greg. You're a fine once in a while situation that I would never dream of associating myself with in public. You're kind of a disaster sometimes, man. You're fun. You are. But just... just get it together, dude. Do I need an artisan barbecue glaze on my crust? Do I? Do I need to invite Kegger Greg to my wedding? Of course not. Be greasy and awful and ridiculous, Pizza Hut. Be a big sloppy mess, Kegger Greg. And don't, either one of you, ever ever pretend to grow up. You're kids forever, dudes.
