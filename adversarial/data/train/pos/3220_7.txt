This is a great restaurant located inside the Venetian hotel on the Las Vegas Strip.  \n\nWe've been here several times and it's always busy but you still can be seated quickly. \n\nThey have a very extensive menu and it's all good. I've had some salads, pastas and meats here.   They also have great desserts.  \n\nI believe this is a sister property to Cheesecake Factory who also has a very extensive menu. With great service and a great atmosphere. \n\nWe came in last night and they were way busy so we just posted up at the bar, got some drinks and had our steaks right there.  Our bartender was great. Unfortunately I can't remember her name.  (1 too many Long Islands).
