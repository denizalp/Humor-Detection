Local furniture shopping at its finest! In the midst of prepping for baby to be, we are also in the middle of moving into a new house which means furniture shopping. Luckily a place like Ladlow's exists. \n\nFirst off, this is a local store that's been in the Valley for 14+ years. They carry furniture of all shapes, styles, sizes and most importantly, prices! Yes, you can walk away spending an arm and a leg, but you can also leave with some beautiful furniture that doesn't break the bank. They have everything from classic furniture and modern furniture, to furniture that can fill a mansion as well as a condo. In addition to their variety of price options, they also offer great sales and most of the time, half the furniture is marked down. \n\nWhen we first walked in, we were greeted by friendly Bob who guided us through the store and then helped us with our purchases. He offered the perfect amount of customer service. He was friendly and helpful but not overbearing. He's a veteran employee of the store, so he knows his way around and he knows the inventory inside and out. \n\nWe left with some major purchases to help us move into our new home and I have a feeling we'll be back for another trip or two! If you're looking for new furniture, stop by Ladlow's and be sure to ask for Bob!
