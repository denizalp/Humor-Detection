We came here for my birthday and my wife set up reservations about a month before.  We got here about 7pm on a Wednesday.  It was busy when we got here but the bar was open.  Since we had reservations we still asked to be seated at a table.  This was the second time that we had been here but it's been awhile since our first visit.  If we come here again I think I would rather sit at the bar.  The tables here are close together and the bar looks more inviting.\n\n We ordered drinks and browsed the menu.  We kind of knew what we were going to get before but they did have specials for the day.  I decided to go with the Salmon.  \n\n This restaurant is confusing to me because I think they are going for a really nice restaurant in Plum.  The problem is you get a mixed flow of people coming here from work in professional attire , or a couple on a date, and then you get a guy in a cut off with his loud kids coming here for dinner.  I have no problem with either one but I'm just not sure what type of restaurant they are going for.  I have heard this from other customers too.  With the prices being on the higher side they are going for high quality in my opinion.  \n\n Anyways our food came and my salmon was good.  I was hungry and it just wasn't enough food for me.  I should have ordered an appetizer or something to start.  I usually know that but I thought the salmon would have been enough  this time.  The service was ok and I had a nice time out with my wife for my birthday.   If you are in the plum area I do recommend trying this restaurant it is better than most in the area.  The food is really good compared to most restaurants in this area just a little pricey.
