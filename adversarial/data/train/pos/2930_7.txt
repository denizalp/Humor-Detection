Love at first bite! \n\nWow! Wow! Wow! \n\nFinally had the chance to enjoy this Venezuelan treasure! \n\nMy gal pal and I got the Royal treatment on our first visit! \n\nI ordered a Pepsi with my order, and the Head Chef\/Owner Felix gave me a sample of the Passion fruit juice, I said yes I'll have that!!!!! \n\nNatural Fruit Juices...Mango and Passion fruit mmmmm so yummy! \nYou must order a fruit juice, forget soda. Trust me! \n\nI ordered a shredded beef empanada, my friend ordered two different types of Arepas, we both got a natural fruit juice. \n\nWe sat in my (air conditioned) car to eat as it was hot hot hot outside and this was 10pm at night, ugh. They brought us our order to the car where an awesome conversation was started with the Owner Felix. \n\nSo we chatted with Felix for a bit at the car, we informed him it was our first time trying them out. He gave us a bit of the History behind it all and how he previously worked with Mario Batali! \n\nHe said I must try something so he went and made a Reina Pepiada Arepa for me to try! He told me I am the Reina Pepiada, whatever that means, lol Wow, it was Amazing! Delicious, melted in my mouth, full of flavor! \n\nHe also wanted me to try his Cod empanada since I told him how much I love seafood. Mmmmmm yummy soooooo good, that also melted in my mouth like butta! The best way I have ever eaten cod fish in my life, in form of an empanada. Not just any Empanada but his which is the best! \n\nHe also made a beef empanada for my girl Karen to try, mmmm she loved it, the best empanada ever. \n\nFelix...thank you for treating us so special and taking the time to hang out with us! You truly hooked us up and spoiled us so well!\n\nWe will be back sooner than you think! \n\nMuchos Besos!
