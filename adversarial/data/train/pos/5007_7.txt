I'm a big fan of Thomas Keller! I've been to and love Ad Hoc, French Laundry, and Bouchon Bakery but I hadn't been to Bouchon Bistro until recently and ironically, my first visit was to this Bouchon in Vegas although there's one way closer to me in LA. The vibe and ambience is casual and modern, a cute, upscale French cafe\/bistro within a luxury Vegas hotel. \n\nMy husband and I came here for brunch and enjoyed the Croque Madame w\/ fries and the Hanger Steak Salad. Both were delicious! I especially enjoyed the Croque Madame!! It was so rich and heavenly! Perfect blend of flavors and textures--definitely the best Croque Madame I've ever had and I would totally get it again if I have the chance. Service was polite and top notch. \n\nOverall a solid choice for a decadent, delicious brunch in Vegas. Located inside the Venetian Hotel.
