I always pass this place on my way to work, so I decided to stop in one day. When I first walked in, an unusual pungent smell took over my nose; still not sure why it smells that way. I wanted to turn around then but the reviews were so good, I decided to still order. I asked for a polish sausage but was given a kielbasa; no biggie. Paid for my food and also bought a brownie. The person at the counter said they're baked fresh every Sunday, and these were part of that batch. Sunday was 5 days ago. I think a week is too long to have brownies sitting in a warm restaurant. The place wasn't very sanitary; extremely small, but could still be clean. Rather grimey.\n\nThose few things weren't the worst part, though. There was a wing of some type of insect in my sandwich. Not sure what it is, maybe a moth or something. I did not finish my food, and won't be back. The cleanliness wasn't up to standard and I shouldn't have bug remnants in my food.
