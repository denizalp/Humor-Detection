I wish I had read these reviews before I wasted a one hour trip! I didn't know this place had new ownership, as soon as we looked at the menu we knew something wasn't right cause it was all different but the worse thing is they don't carry the Best Ever Banana Pudding! Their onion rings for an appetizer was the size of a side order & it was just onion rings with no \"onion\"! We sat at the bar & kept seeing waitresses bring food back cause it was cold. Like a lot of places the prices went up & less food!  I will never waste my time coming here again!
