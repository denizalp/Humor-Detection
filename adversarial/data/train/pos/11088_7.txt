Manny's is one of those places that we go to when we just want to know that we are going to get properly cooked Mexican food. The tacos are always crispy (unlike Old Pueblo), though a touch bland. The enchiladas are yummy, but there are no rolled flour tortilla flautas (a personal fave of mine). I ordered the flautas and was surprised when they showed up in corn tortillas. The salsa is my one really \"large\" complaint\". It is way too watery and has no kick at all. Kind of like a chucky catsup with onions. Such a shame! Overall, ), the service is attentive, and the food is tasty if a bit under seasoned.. As unfortunate as this is, it is also the best full service Mexican restaurant in the Litchfield Park area,
