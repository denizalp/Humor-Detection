I don't know what the hell happened to this place. When I went last summer with a friend we had a great time.  I came back this Spring with two female friends of mine and was embarrassed to bring them to such a lame nightclub that as fell from grace. The place has no turned into a club that people go to if they can't get in anywhere else. I like how they fake the line outside for people who aren't on the guest list to make it look like the place is happening. \n\nHere are the problems with the place:\n\n1. It's pretentious, amateur and not elite\/exclusive and it thinks it is.  The promotional video is more impressive online. The don't even know how or if check their guest list.  If you mention you signed up via their website or Montreal Night life.come and you can get in for free.  The girl doorman had no idea what she was doing. \n\n2. The bouncers are rude to everyone and lack what seemed to be social skills. \n\n3. The bartenders are clueless and the drinks way overpriced.  They used a control pour machine which barely dispenses any alcohol to help you forget why you came here in the first place. You could catch a bigger buzz sticking to the $5 bottled water they have. Really guys? Really? You also need a $30 minimum on all credit cards which wasn't the case when I was there previously.  Something tells me that the lack of attendance is eating up their profit margin which they make up via outrageous priced drinks and table service. \n\n4. The table service is more outrageous than Vegas. $1200 for 3 bottles of Smirnoff (due to a 3 bottle minimum). You have to be kidding me.  You can get way more for $500 at any of the elite clubs in Vegas or Miami.  All this leads to 20 dudes cramming into a booth that holds 8 overlooking the crowd and hoping that people will be impressed. Sorry, it's not working.
