Om nom nom nom! Dave and Andy's have delicious homemade ice cream. I always get the waffle cones, some they have the ability to make yummy things even yummier. \n\nI always end up getting some variant of chocolate - chocolate, chocolate chips, rocky road, chocolate and peanut butter, chocolate and coffee, etc. \n\nIt's in a great location, especially for cmu and Pitt students - Oakland. They don't have great seating  arrangements, but you could also take one and walk over to a nearby park and enjoy your ice cream in the sun. Also, the walk helps with burning some of the calories.
