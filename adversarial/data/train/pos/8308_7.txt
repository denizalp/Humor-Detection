I was trying to be \"good\" on my trip to Vegas this time...trying to eat well and not go overboard...exercise daily...all that went out the window when at 10pm I turned the corner in the Miracle Mile and like a shining beacon from Heaven saw the words \"LOBSTER ME\" (I do believe I heard angels singing...)\n\nI wanted it all...I wanted to try EVERYTHING...my head was spinning with Lobster combinations that I had never had before...but I settled for a single Lobsicle.  After all, I was trying to be \"good\" wasn't I?  I figured a Lobsicle's portability could assist in my noble attempt to stay on my \"diet\" since I could easily eat it while walking the mall for 3 miles...I'd just call it a \"push.\"  Riiiiiiiiight...\n\nI walked around gnawing that thing and must have been stopped by 10 people asking me \"what IS that?\" - I pointed behind me in the direction of the pearly gates and said \"Lobster Me!\" - run, run while it's still open!!!\n\nNeedless to say...I gave in to temptation, which is not hard to do in Vegas.  I went back in the morning for the Lobster & Waffles...and the Lobster Wontons, and the Grilled Cheese, and the bisque, and the ice cream...and another Lobsicle.  Ok, ok, I admit it...I have a problem.  A serious lobster problem.  The only thing that could have made any of this any better would have been bacon...\n\nSeriously, the people who DIDN'T give this 5 stars are all on crack...yes, it's expensive people...it's REAL LOBSTER!!!!  It's not langoustines, not crawfish, not any other stupid thing cheap restaurants try to pass off as real lobster...this is the REAL THING!!!  It is from New England and sweet and succulent and AWESOME!!!!  This food could easily be served in a fancy restaurant for more money!!\n\nLobster rolls - no filler, just a soft, sweet brioche-type bun with delicious seasoned lobster and more lobster...we could all argue until the cows come home over what makes a good roll, a bunch of mayo & celery or just seasoned lobster on a roll, but this roll is for purists...not people looking for a hot dog bun with lobster salad plopped in it.\n\nLobster Wontons - the filling is some kind of curried lobster mix and delicious, served with a side of sweet chili sauce.\n\nLobster Grilled Cheese - almost like a creamy cheese & lobster panini but softly toasted bread and creamy yummy cheese inside.  To die for!!!\n\nLobster Mac & Cheese - yes, it's on the \"drier\" side of the Mac & Cheese gamut, but that's what makes it so perfect.  Just lobster, cheese, breadcrumbs and YUM!  This is NOT your Kraft Mac & Cheese, it is not your mom's ooey-gooey runny cheese type Mac & Cheese.  It is like the kind you get in an upscale restaurant that only needs a few ingredients to make it good.  I have tried every Lobster Mac & Cheese I have ever seen, and this one is definitely one of the best!\n\nLobster on a stick (called a \"Lobsicle\") - ok, who is the friggin' GENIUS who invented THIS???  Let's put a Lobster Tail on a stick, deep fat fry it, and serve it with a slice of lemon and a bucket of butter...this is so much better than the crap-on-a-stick you get at the fair!!!  I picture this to be the fair food of the Rich & Famous...like there is a little Lobster stand at the Beach near the Hamptons where Muffy & Biff can stop and pick up a few Lobsicles to eat as they stroll the beach in their white tennis outfits?\n\nLobster Bisque - not the best I've ever had (that was the Clubhouse at South Coast Plaza - RIP) but it is a really REALLY good knock-off!!!  I am a HUGE Lobster Bisque snob...I like my bisque more on the creamy sherry side & not the tomato fishy side.  This was a perfect creamy sherry laced tasting bisque with a huge dollop of chopped lobster bits thrown in - all served hot & fresh in a yummy sourdough bowl.  I could have eaten 3 more of these...\n\nLobster Ice Cream - I know, it sounds gross...but it is AWESOME!!!!  Vanilla-based ice cream with chunks of lobster throughout.  Not sure if they soak the lobster in sugar or if it really is just that sweet to begin with, but this is one special taste you need to try!!!  They will let you have a small taste if you ask for it- try it!!!\n\nLobster Waffles - Now, let me preface this by saying that I am a HUGE fan of bacon & syrup together...I went ape-sh*t when Denny's had \"Baconalia\" and made the maple syrup bacon sundae.  If you like sweet & salty things, you will LOVE these Lobster Waffles.  Like in the Lobster ice cream, the lobster they use is the sweet New England kind, so it blends perfectly with the Belgian-style waffle & maple syrup.  The chunks of Lobster are tempura-battered and tossed on top of the waffle.  I cut mine up so I could savor a bite of everything each time...and used the extra side of syrup provided (of course!)\n\nI will be back...again and again and again...LOBSTER ME BAY BAY!!!!
