Women.....without em' we would be nothing. Literally. They not only give us life, but they have and continue to contribute so much to this world! This museum helps highlight the amazing things women have done in the aerospace realm.\n\nA small and cozy museum filled with some amazing facts and artifacts. Everyone always wants to go to the large and well-known​ museums. Don't get me wrong, they rock. But, small museums like this one is where it is at! \n\nFree to the public, it is inside the Burke Lakefront Airport. You literally just walk right into this museum. The staff here is absolutely amazing and will answer any questions you have with a smile and lots of information. I had the pleasure of experiencing this museum first at a Yelp Elite event....but have been back several times since for a few public events. \n\nNot only do you get to learn a lot about women in aerospace, you can watch the planes take off from the airport. Really, a great experience overall! Take your kids for a few hours and learn more about amazing women in history​!
