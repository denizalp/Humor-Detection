What a fun event!! So much food and such good music! We had an absolute blast! The VIP tickets were great in that they had some close stage viewing areas and clean bathrooms but not much other perks than that. Plus finding the VIP area was a bit of a pain but once you're there you're good.\n\nThere were lots of vendors with free gifts. Toyota did a great job with their spot. We got all kinds of cool toys, light up bracelets\/rings and candy from them.
