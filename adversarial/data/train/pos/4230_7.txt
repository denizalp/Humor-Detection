New place. Thought I'd try it. Signage is bad. Hard to tell if they're even open. Couldn't order at the drive through. Employees outside smoking, they were open, but no interest in taking my order. I always worry... if you can't even bother to take my money, how much effort are you going to put in to food safety, etc? No thanks.
