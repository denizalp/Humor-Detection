We went to Bootleggers after being teased by the picture of the bloody mary with the mini slider on top. We drove up on a Saturday and were disappointed to learn they only serve those on Sunday's. \n\nWe opted for the regular bloody mary and the mixture was so spicy I could barely finish it. That was disappointing because it will probably sway me away from ordering it on a Sunday. \n\nI saw bacon board on the menu and could not talk myself out of ordering it. It was delicious! It was a carefully curated collection of the finest all-natural swine slabs served with w\/griddled toast, sweet onion jam, house yellow mustard and house brined pickles. The sweet cherry and the jalapeno were my favorite. I balanced that out with the kale salad and it was equally good. \n\nI will definitely return as it is a local spot with friendly staff, I just may not get the bloody mary.
