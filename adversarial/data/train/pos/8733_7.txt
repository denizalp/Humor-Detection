I'm not a big reviewer, but I was just really surprised by this place. Like the reviews say, the food is great! The place looks awesome and I love that more people are helping make the neighborhood a destination. \n\nMy boyfriend and I went before a show at the Beachland. I'm not surprised we didn't get a table, but I couldn't believe the clientele! There were so many older snotty people! I'm not sure where they come from because they appeared to have money but poor taste. This place specializes in cocktails and they were repeatedly ordering things like margaritas, soco and lime and things with flavored vodka (which they carry none of). It was a complete mismatch! If you're up to speed with trends, even just a bit, you may notice it too. My recommendation is to get there early or make a reso because it becomes painful trying to sit at the bar with an affliction wearing 60 year old who won't take his elbow off your chair and scoffs at the bartender every time he orders a mixed drink.
