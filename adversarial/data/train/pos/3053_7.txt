Oh Blue Fin, what can I say about you? Lisa L takes me here, oh about every other day. Best sushi I've ever had. We usually do the AYCE option, priced at $26. Each time I go I've had a mix of pieces, handrolls, and the full rolls. Alaskan and Arizona are 2 of my favorites. All of the fish is really fresh, and Jin always throws in some bonus thing for us, usually not even on the menu. Blue Fin just passed its two year anniversary. Definitely worth checking out!
