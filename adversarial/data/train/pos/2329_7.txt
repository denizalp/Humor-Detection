Not sure what was going when the Montreal Mirror wrote that review of Star of India but something must have changed. Their food was marginal.... and that's talking about the best dish I had. \n\nI think what really took the cake was when I had an order of chapati (for $1.50) and only 1 came. What's with that?! It's like buying a bag of chips only to find out that there are only a few in the entire bag..... \n\nIt's like an electronic toy given without the batteries on Christmas...\n\nI mean if this chapati had been made with golden, mythical, Elysian wheat then maybe the price would have been justified...\n\nOk i'm done. Star of India, like your name implies, only 1 star for you.
