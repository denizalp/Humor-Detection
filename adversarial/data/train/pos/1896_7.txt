Thanks to all the Yelpers who guided me in the direction of Central Phoenix Eye Care! I was thrilled with my visit.\n\nNow, this review is somewhat biased because I feel that an eye appointment is one of the few health-related appointments that doesn't instill fear and frustration. I mean...your eye doctor isn't going to tell you that you have high blood pressure or pubic lice (not saying mine ever has of course...). But that being said, I still had one hell of a good experience at Central Phoenix Eye Care. \n\nI was greeted by friendly ladies at the front desk, taken through a round of eye inspections by some helpful eye nurses (or whatever they'd be called), and was warmly taken care of by the lovely Dr. Heather Thompson. \n\nBecause I'm a bit of an idiot sometimes, I totally forgot my contact prescription. No one complained and they easily found a prescription that fit me perfectly. I had great insurance coverage here (which is saying a lot with my crappy coverage!) and I was sent out the door with tons of free samples of contact solution and eye drops. \n\nI will be recommending Dr. Thompson and the rest of Central Phoenix Eye Care's staff to everyone I know. They were awesome and I will definitely be back!
