If you like arm pits and taints, you will love the plaza hotel and Casino. The only good thing about the Plaza was Firefly, and even they left. \n\nI know that there is a renovation going on. I've heard. So don't bother telling me about all the millions in improvements that are taking place. In response to the million dollar make over I will leave you with a line my grandfather was famous for using. \" You can't polish a turd.\"
