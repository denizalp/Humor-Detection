Truly breathtaking...the whole family came to witness the new spectacle that finally came to Las Vegas \"Chinese Lantern Festival!\"\n\nFrom the beginning you enjoy all the Chinese Zodiac animals and soon get immersed in such amazing sculpted lantern artworks. Take your time and read each informative writing to teach you what you are viewing. Near the Terra Cotta Chinese soldiers is the nightly show. Get there early if you want a seat, but anything near will be spectacular as you watch in amazement. \n\nWe tried plenty of food and perused the trinkets for sale, the aluminum sculptures were quite intricate as well as the inner bottle painting. \n\nPlenty of photo opportunities and memories to be made with the family. Hopefully they return again next year so we can create some more local traditions.
