Thanks to Kelly O. I too got me 4 free cupcakes.  I shared them with my coworkers but I managed to score me a Creme Brulee one, which happens to be one of my favourite desserts.\n\nThere seems to be a rash of new Cupcake places sprouting up all over the GTA (see: the Yelp Cupcake crawl we had a few months back), and they're all good.  But they're all fairly expensive for a couple of bites.  Instead of Omnomnom.. it's more like.. Om.\n\nThe Cupcake itself was awesome, but it'd work out to be $1.25 a bite, really I could probably do it in one.. Omnom.\n\nFor the same price, you can definitely get bigger ones in Toronto, and yes although size isn't everything when it comes to some things (*ahem*)... when it comes to cupcakes, it means something.  If you develop a cupcake addiction here, I'm sure heroin would be cheaper.\n\nI'm interested in trying their printable cookies though.  You can send them a picture, and they'll make an edible cookie out of it!!  If I do, I'll report back.
