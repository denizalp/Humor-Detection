My review for the Eastern location shows I detest it and I pretty much never wanted to step foot in a Cafe Rio ever again.  However, it is near UNLV so I find it easy to walk there and most people around here like it for a quick lunch.  At first, I was partial to the Thursday special only - 2 chicken tamales with green sauce.  This is tasty and usually lasts 2 meals.  Yet once I found out how good the tortilla soup is, that is pretty much the only thing I get now.\n\nIt is made to order, and I get everything: shredded chicken, guacamole, cheese, pico, chicken broth with carrots and onion, and topped with (or on the side) cilantro sprigs, lime, and tortilla strips, with a warm tortilla on the side.  It is just over $4 and very satisfying.  Comforting grub.  Props for a variety of flavored iced teas and Mexican coke in non-crazy sized bottles.  That's all she wrote!
