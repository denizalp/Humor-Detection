I enjoy volunteering and I try to do it as much as I can. I am so glad I was able to make it to this fun event and thankful that I could participate in making a difference in kids lives. \n\nThere is tons of parking out front and the location is very easy to find. Checking in is super easy and they have plenty of lockers for you to put your stuff in. The briefing was quick and very informative and we were all super stoked to start doing our tasks. \n\nI was put on the labeling task and it was fun! At the end of the night, after all of the boxes were counted, they informed us that during our two hours there, boxes of food for 78 kids were packaged!! This means that 78 kids will get a box of food that will feed them for a whole year! Amazing!\n\nIt was a great night and we enjoyed being able to help out! They have tons of cute trinkets, very pretty bags, and cool looking shirts if you'd like to purchase a keepsake. They always take monetary donations and of course anything helps! \n\nDon't wear any jewelry and make sure to wear closed toed shoes if going to volunteer! You will also be given a hairnet!\n\nThank you Yelp and Hailey for a great night!
