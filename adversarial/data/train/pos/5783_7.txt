I have been to Brandy many times and never had a problem. Today I was dissatisfied with my hair and she wasn't willing to make it right unless I was willing to pay her more.  I am thoroughly disappointed and unfortunately will not return to her. I feel like she knew that I wasn't going to get what I was looking for and she failed to tell me until she was done with the process.  \nMy appt was at 2:45, I arrived early and she was almost 25 minutes late to get me then asked if my appt was at 3 and told me she didn't know I was there.  The girls at the desk went back twice after asking me who I was waiting for. Soooooooo?\nI'll be finding another stylist. The salon seems great I just wouldn't want someone who wasn't willing to take ownership for an error and make it right to do my hair again.  I would be willing to find another stylist there.
