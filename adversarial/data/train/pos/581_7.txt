i have a bone to pick with mr. wolfgang puck. i adore this man with witty sense of humor, thick accent and mad culinary skills. if he had said sh*t tasted like uni, i'd have believed him...but now i am beginning to not trust him entirely :( \n\ni saw an episode of \"the best thing i ate\" featuring payard's macarons and wolfgang puck's smiling face as he bit into one of them. i love macarons, i adore mr. puck, and these two put together was definitely irresistible. \n\nnever mind the hidden location of the pastisserie. look beyond the dark wooden interior. forgive the disorganized staff. i was there for macarons and only macarons. oddly, the macarons were not displayed nor sold individually. they come as prepackaged in 6 different flavors for $10, not too expensive considering its fame and location. \n\ni expected the same reaction as mr. puck's on the food network show, but i cringed my face in disappointment. they were definitely not the \"best thing i ate\". given the size (tiny, tiny and tiny), it's probably hard to bake them to that perfect crispiness outside and softness inside, but the cookies themselves had no textural variance. of the 6 macarons, no flavors were exotic nor unique, if you compare them to paulette's, and even to bottega louie's. some had overwhelming flavors (strawberry) while others were too mild to detect anything other than the almond filling (chocolate). \n\nunfortunately, i do not know mr. wolfgang puck personally nor do i have the nerve to say how he disappointed me in person. i discovered another talent of puck though...acting!!!
