Came in for a new license. Pre-filled paperwork online to help cut down time. I waited about 15 mins for someone to check me in. No greeting or hello the service rep said \"What I do for you?\" No smile at all. I explained why I was here and handed her my paperwork. She then asked me to step to the side and get my picture. Then pushed all my paperwork back to me and said they will call me after it processes. It took them about an hour to process everything. So plan on waiting. I came on a Monday around 11ish. It was not packed just the processing process is slow. The fees will be higher because it's a 3rd party however it is worth it since the MVD wait would be even longer.\n\n\nThe place is clean but smells like a musty odor. There is plenty of seating and open windows to service you. Parking is not a problem.
