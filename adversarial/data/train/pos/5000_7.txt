Went here for lunch today. I've been a couple of times and each time I've been impressed. It's a tiny, dingy stripmall place with a drink fountain on one side, couple of bench seats, couple of tables, and a counter up the back. They've got the usual huge menu - all sorts of chicken, pork and beef dishes. Doesn't sound like much, but it gets four stars based on the following. It's excellent value, it's fresh, tasty and filling food, and you don't wait more than five minutes for it to be prepared. As we all know, regular Chinese take-away isn't terribly spectacular at the best of times, but this place has bowls, combos and dinner specials for extremely reasonable prices, and you get a LOT of food. Today, for example, I got the lunch combo for take-out. Were I to have stayed, it would have been unlimited soda refills (of course). The meal included the mongolian chicken, rice fried in soy sauce, an eggroll, two small containers of sauce, a fortune cookie, two sachets of soy sauce, fork, napkins and they even threw piece of cardboard at the bottom of the take-out bag so the whole shebang wouldn't tilt and spill while being carried.\n\nBig deal, you say? It was $5.75. Yeah, it IS a big deal to me. The rice was piping hot and fresh out of the wok, the rest of the meal was delicious, I've been several times and I haven't gotten food poisoning (UNLIKE several Mexican crapholes scattered around town), and you're stuffed for under six bucks. Yeah, it wasn't haute cuisine. Yeah, I wasn't eating duck sphincter with bat cock pate and an olive tapenade by candlelight at some ridiculous elite event. But it was delicious, substantial, and more than enough to keep me coming back.
