My visit and experience at 10am on a Tuesday is a solid 5*. If this visit were near end of the day I'm sure it would be a 3.5*\n\nI was First in the parking lot and as I reached my arm to open the door, I was rudely cut off by a mature lady who apparently had to be the first one in, which made me wonder how many pastries are made at that time. \nWhew! Lots of fresh baked croissants were on the rolling rack getting lined up in the show case, and all the cakes were ready for the picking. \nLawrence was very friendly, greeted us good morning and was ready to help while the others were busy cleaning off their pastry tools in the kitchen. Got 6, the chocolate, almond, plain, beef & cheese. \nI must say, a hot fresh croissant is my standard for rating a croissant and these were so good, I got 6, plus 3 dessert tarts all to go. He mentioned that it's best to enjoy in house as some desserts do not survive the car trip and lack of refrigeration.   The roast beef & Swiss cheese croissant was so delicate, flaky(not quite Parisian but close) I ate that like a Krispy Kreme donut hot off the conveyor belt OMNOMNOM\nWhen I returned for another one in afternoon they were not the same, the flaky layers kinda melded somewhat but still had a nice chew in the middle and fully flaky outside crust, hence 3.5* now \n\nWould definitely recommend if you are a croissant fan, to try and make it early and enjoy it while still hot\/warm, otherwise this is why other reviewers say they don't get the hype. \n\nChestnut- done well, but if you are not a nut fan you will not appreciate this no matter what they did to it. In my husbands case, no amount of chocolate could make it better.
