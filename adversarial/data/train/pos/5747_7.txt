I had never stepped foot inside this location until earlier today. My glasses were being fixed right down the road and I was told to come back in an hour, so I figured I may as well get a workout in while I wait. This is what I took away from my experience here..\n\n(+) Great open floor layout! Like MUCH better set up than my usual location at Durango! Plenty of machines, cardio equipment and benches available. I really loved that fact that it was pretty slow in there around 1pm today!\n(+) Things were pretty neat and in order, for the most part. Weights were racked and in their proper place. I love it.\n(+) Love the old school vibe I got from being here. It isn't as shiny and new, like the one I'm used to at the Durango location....and I actually like that!\n(+) the young lady working the front desk was understanding when I told her my keycard was on my other keychain. She just looked me up and let me in. I really appreciated that she wasn't a \"towel nazi\" since I didn't have mine with me. At Durango, they would have seized the opportunity to charge my card on file that whopping $1 fee. I appreciate that this was a hassle free experience!\n\n(-) Only 1 water fountain was working off the gym floor and even that one had a very, VERY weak stream. I worked with it, because I didn't have much of a choice..lol...but that is something they seriously need to address....and soon..\n\nI really like this location and wish I lived closer so I could come here more often! This place is solid and a great place to get in a workout!\n\n4 stars.
