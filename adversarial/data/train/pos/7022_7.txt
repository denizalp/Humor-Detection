Wanted to make reservations so I called in today but nobody bothered to pick up. I was put on hold for over 15 minutes so I just hung up. Very disappointed.\n\nI came here once during the summer and really enjoyed the food but they really need to improve their customer service.\n\nI'm not sure if the line was just busy or something but having to wait so long just to call in for reservations is just ridiculous. \n\nI'm so sad now ;-;\n\n\nUPDATE!\n\nSo half an hour after I posted this, KaKa messaged me and apologized and the manager personally helped me make my reservations!\n\nWhen I arrived the manager personally came to the restaurant to apologize even though it was her day off! \n\nIrene is super sincere and she explained that there are hundreds of calls everyday and that they try their best to accommodate. I really appreciate her coming on her day off just to make sure all her customers are happy. She takes her customers very seriously so I truly appreciate it!
