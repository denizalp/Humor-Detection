I love coming here and sitting outside with an iced tea in my hand watching the fountains dance to the music.  So romantic and relaxing.\n\nThe food here is a bit pricy but worth it.  I've had the soft shell sandwich here, OMG!!!  I was in heaven.  The crab was crispy with a lot of crab taste.  MMMM\n\nThe service is average.  \n\nCome for the ambiance.  You can't get a better view of the Fountains than here!!
