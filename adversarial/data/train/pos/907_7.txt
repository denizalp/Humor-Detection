OK, I'll get the bad stuff out of the way first. \n\nThai Basil is pretty decent Thai food, but it gets frustrating when each time you go, the story is always the same: a really long wait for any food to appear on your table.\n\nConsidering it's not a fancy, hoity toity sit down place, this is a little unusual. Even soups and satays take around 25-30 minutes. There may be only one cook doing everything the back kitchen, but they need to sort this out because at least something to munch on (appetizer\/soup) should appear in front of you within 15 minutes of giving your order. \n\nThat said, now the good stuff. \n\nThe food is pretty decent. Not amazing Thai, but not mediocre either. And when you ask for the food to be spicy, they don't just nod their heads and then ignore your request. They'll routinely make it spicy to order. I've had their special Thai Basil Chicken, as well as the red, yellow, green, and masaman curries - and they've all got good flavor. Service is friendly, and waters will constantly be refilled, and if it wasn't for the food taking forever each and every time, I'd give the service a really high rating. \n\nThe restaurant itself is clean and not too big (strip mall setting), and you've got your Tempe undergrad\/grad student\/older folks mix of patrons about.\n\nAll in all, I'd give the food somewhere between 3.5 to 4 stars, but the wait is what holds the overall rating back at 3, unfortunately. I'd definitely recommend their food if you're in the Tempe area, as again it is decent Thai, but either order it to go or be in the mindset for a very leisurely lunch or dinner (ie. come up with some good conversation topics with your companions).
