5 STAR! 5 STAR! 5 STAR!\nWow... What else can I say?\nIf you haven't been to Cafe ZuZu - what are you waiting for? I was sorry it took me so long to get there!!\n\nThe amazing, talented Chef Sean created wonders on a plate...\nSeared Ahi - Delicious\nTruffled Grilled Cheese - Outstanding\nAsian Pear Salad - Perfection\n(That was course #1)\nBrussel Sprouts Au Gratin - Mmmmm\nCrab Cakes over Cheesy Grits - Speechless\nLamb Sausage - Oh so good\nMussels - Seriously the BEST I've ever had (anywhere)!! \n(That was course #2)\nTropical Iced Tea w\/Fresh Mint & a side of Simple Syrup -  Refreshing\n(Could not fit another course in... will have to go back for dessert!)\n\nWell, enough about the food, let's move on to the atmosphere. Very cool, very chic, very retro (50's). We could not stop thinking & talking of ideas on how to bring more people here, i.e., family, friends, large gatherings, work parties, etc. We want to share the feeling & the fabulous food we enjoyed here. Not to mention, they try to source local, have fresh herb garden right outside the kitchens back door, and mostly made from scratch! The service was personable & friendly! And we hear they have a great happy hour during the week, which we will definitely be back for!\n\nThe team that put life back into the Hotel Valley Ho & Cafe ZuZu is genius! The place is simply impressive. A gem tucked away that should be admired, enjoyed & taken to the next level! \n\nGO NOW! =)
