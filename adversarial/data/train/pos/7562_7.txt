The hubby and I have been going to New Generation (original location aka \"MurderGen\" - on account of the murder and all) for years until the kid came along and now we're yearning for more space but refuse to defect and go to that bastard location Sushi on Bloor - so we checked out this new location aptly now dubbed \"Non-MurderGen\". \n\nAs far as the food goes, Non-MurderGen is pretty on par with MurderGen, definitely the same sushi menu with some added dishes for the new Korean BBQ menu. And there is definitely space to be had for strollers and such. However what this new location gains in space (and not freezing your ass off in line outside of the original location hoping to God you get a booth and not the bar), it lacks in dish consistency and service. \n\nOur miso soups were different. I had the seaweed and the hubs had the tofu...we decided to split half of each others. And we had to ask a few times for chopsticks, which one would believe to be fairly standard at a sushi restaurant.\n\nPlus it doesn't have that waiter at this location who remembers who we are and gives us free edamame. No free edamame - no 4th star!!!
