Once again, another awesome expierence at I Love Sushi on Eastern. Since I already wrote a review earlier that states how much I enjoy this restaurant, let me just add this little bit:\n\nYou know you ordered to much sushi for two people when the waitress says.... \n\n::Server:: Are you sure you want to order all that? It's enough for 4-5 people. \n\n::ME:: Yes.... were fat. :)
