Serendipity is one the more family friendly attractions in Vegas. Located just off Las Vegas Blvd, right in front of Caesar's Palace, Serendipity offers an extensive menu comprised from delightful variations of traditional American dishes and desserts.  \n\nThe décor transmits a retro odds and ends type of style, channeling themes of Alice in Wonderland & Willy Wonka's Chocolate Factory.\n\nAfter walking up and down the strip under the blistering desert sun I was parched and in dire need of something refreshing. I took a quick gander at the mobile yelp app and I decided to check out Serendipity's infamous Frozen Hot Chocolate. \n\nI was quickly seated during the early afternoon (2pm Wednesday). My friend and I decided to share a Frozen Hot Chocolate for Two. We also desired something piquant that would enhance the sweetness of the chocolate, so we happily ordered a side of Sweet Potato Fries.   \n\nThe food was magnificent, simple and very delicious. The Frozen Hot Chocolate is essentially Nestlé's instant hot chocolate dry mix blended with ice and garnished with whip cream & bits of chocolate. For whatever reason I was anticipating a malty texture similar to a milk shake, boy was I wrong. The texture is something like a slush, very icy and rich, drinking it does not require much effort. (very sweet) \n\nThe chocolate and sweet potato fries complimented each other perfectly. (Something salty with something sweet). Maybe a little bit more salty than I would have liked, but still very delicious. \n\nSince we did not order anything too elaborate (due to the mixed yelp reviews) I glanced around the room to see what the other patrons had ordered. I noticed tea tray towers filled with dishes such as sandwiches and various types of finger foods, also very charming tableware brandishing the Serendipity name which occupied savory looking salads, pizzas, burgers, sundaes, ribs, cakes, deep fried oreos and everything else that screams America.  \n\nAll in all I had a really good experience here. This is definitely a cute place to come with your girlfriend or your wife & kids. I loved it I was in good company and it kept me out of the sun. \n\nWord of advice order a water.. you will need it! \n\nYour average dish here is between $10-$20\nAny dessert (preferably ice cream) can be topped with a selection of candies, nuts, and sauces for an additional $1\/each. \n\nCheck them out at: http:\/\/www.caesarspalace.com\/casinos\/caesars-palace\/restaurants-dining\/serendipity-3-detail.html
