This review is strictly based on the dog park. I have visited this location on several occasions & my doggies love it. \n\nThe dog park is split off into a large dog section & a small dog section. The large dog section is massive! I couldn't believe how far it stretched during my first visit. I am from Virginia & we do not have dog parks this size! \n\nEach section of the dog park has a water spout, plenty of picnic tables for the humans, pools for the pups, & various toys. The large dog section of the park is a mix of grass, gravel, & dirt. I have a love\/hate relationship with this because my dogs are easily cooled off by the dirt on those hot summer days, but usually end up leaving with loads of dust. \n\nMy biggest complaint is the fact that there are numerous mud puddles throughout the park. There is no true drain system around the water spout, which causes a ton of nasty standing water. My advice, bring a towel every time! \n\nOther than that, there are always friendly dogs & the park is kept up for the most part. I will continue to take my pups here. They leave happy & if they are happy, I am happy!
