This is the exact type of reason why I left vegas ... everyone is so shady here , I love Uber but driver like this one that we had last night is giving your company a horrible reputation . We had a short ride from pho Kim long to our hotel . Maybe he thought we were drunk or are tourist and don't know better but he charged us a cleaning fee when we had nothing in the car to make a mess. When the photos were sent to my friends email it was literally a picture of a 1 inch water stain in his already dirty car. He charged a $40 cleaning fee emailed to us the 12 hours later How do we know if he had picked up customers after us ? How do we know if that stain wasn't already in his car? This is messed up on so many levels . I don't want to use Uber anymore in vegas and just go with regular taxi
