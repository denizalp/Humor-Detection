China Chade has been a hit or miss for a while. Delivery boy asked for a bigger tip than the 10% I tipped him for the short drive on top of the fee already charged for delivery. Cold food, I've had better Chinese. I've thrown food away before. I understand everybody deserves their gratuity, but in a business you need to realize people are sensitive and can't always give much. So when someone doesn't give much, you need to respect that. I've never had someone ask for a bigger tip. Sadly not ordering from here again.
