...I guess they could just let the vagrants move into this Post Office.  Seriously filthy facilities, many questionable sorts hanging around even at 4:30pm, and rude customer service.  I admittedly don't expect much from the USPS at this point, aside from overpriced and low quality service, but this place is seriously in need of an overhaul and at least a security guard.
