It's clear that this place is all about meat.  But they do have a unique take that separates them from traditional steak houses.  In my book, nothing beats the ribeye and that's why it can be expensive.  Echo offers entres that are just parts of the ribeye for a small pricetag.  They also have other non traditional cuts and preparations named after people no one knows.\n\nThe appetizers and sides are very creative and more interesting than tasty.  We had the legendary fries, but I wasn't too impressed.\n\nI took a chance and went with a flatsteak with a french name rather than my favorite ribeye just to try something new.  It was a mistake.  The edges were completely burnt.  I wanted to send it back but the waiter rarely came by the table and the cut was so small it didn't seem worth the trouble.\n\nThe next morning I was not well.  I definitely had food poisoning but I really don't know for sure if it was from Echo & Rig.  We had a big group and shared most the appetizers and I was the only one sick.  And I know it can take over 24 hours for the symptoms to show after you eat the poisoned food.  I'm just mentioning it because it was the last meal I ate before the sickness and I had a lite lunch the meal before no breakfast.\n\nSo while I dig the atmosphere and creativeness.   I didn't dig the burnt steak or illness.
