The bottom line here is... the bottom line ($$$$)\n\nNever wanted to award negative stars before...but please understand that this establishment deserves negative 5 stars...the worst of the worst.\n\nThe legally trick people out of money with the fine print of the contracts.  The norm at combat gyms is 30 or 60 days notice to cancel a membership.  At Fasi your contract automatically renews for 3 years with a $500 termination fee...so if you were planning on canceling but forgot to get your written notice in it's not as if you are just charged for another month or two at $60 a pop.  You are literally charged $500 to cancel.  And the best part is that you signed it while someone said \"this paragraph just states that you  have to give 30 days notice to cancel.\"\n\nIt's not a scam because it is a legal contract...it is just horribly dishonest business practices aimed at nothing more than extracting as much money as our state allows.
