Great service and ambience. Salmon and tilapia taco and the refried beans were very bland! Not usual for Rubio's so I was dissatisfied. The gourmet shrimp taco was excellent. Cheese, bacon and salsa and the well seasoned shrimp blended extremely well. Another positive was that the soda fountain station housed Vanilla Coke which is rare for restaurants.
