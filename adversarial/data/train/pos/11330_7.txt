I was really excited about this place based on all the recommendations and the photos (lol). So I guess I had high expectations because I was noooot impressed. \n\nWalking in, it smells delicious! It seems to be better sitting at the bar in order to watch everything being made. But we were a party of 6 -- 5 or more, gratuity is included in the check -- so we were seated at a table. You have to come at a good time (I'm not sure when exactly) because it's pretty small in there. Probably less than 20 people can be seated in the entire restaurant. \n\nIt was $15 for a two-course dessert meal. The first course is their daily special type thing. Ours for the night was some sort of pineapple sorbet I believe. The second course was your choice of five items. I think the menu changes every so often... \n\nI ordered the miyabi and the rest of my table ordered different things so we can try them all! Buuuut again, I was not impressed. Maybe I don't have the palette for $15 desserts...\n\nAnyways, come for the photos and experience, but don't expect the desserts to blow your mind!
