I've stayed at PH twice and even though on my birthday weekend, we coincidentally got a room with Star Trek memorabilia (I'm a huge Trekkie, so imagine my excitement), both trips were pretty terrible.\n\nFirst time, I ended up in the hospital (had nothing to do with PH) and the second time, I spent a good hour or two wrapped up in one of our bed's comforters, crying to my friends in the hallway outside of our room (probably the most dramatic Vegas trip thus far). Even though both times, there was absolutely nothing wrong with PH, the mention of PH still brings back bad memories.\n\nWith that said, I feel like it's unfair to rate them poorly, so based on the hotel itself, I have no complaints! I mean, come on, Star Trek memorabilia?! I was so excited when my friend pointed it out when we were settling in. Both times, we stayed in a Hollywood Hip Room and the beds were pretty comfy.\n\nPlus, Earl of Sandwich is located inside PH and anytime you're hungry (seriously, it's open 24\/7), you can go down and grab a sub! Since our friends are Diamond members, we also don't have to wait in the horrendous line to order.\n\n3.5
