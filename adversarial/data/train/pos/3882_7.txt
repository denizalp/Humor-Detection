I had never heard of this place before and randomly found it on yelp.  It's located right of the 101 and was pretty easy to find once in the parking lot.  Go in the main enterance and turn right, you can't miss it.  The only crappy thing was finding parking near by.  The street parking was all taken and the dirt parking lot was so chaotic that people were parking in areas that were blocking other cars in.  But being willing to walk just a few feet extra and you'll find parking.\n\nThere was plenty of seating outside and and equal amount inside.  I went on a friday night and was seated right away.  I ordered a pretty plain cheese pizza but it was delicious.  The only down side was it felt like forever that it took to make and bring us our personal pan pizzas.  Once we had them things were good.\n\nI would have no problem returning here and getting more delicious pizza.
