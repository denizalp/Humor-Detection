What an awesome time! My girlfriends and I wanted to go on a best strip club tour around vegas. We stopped by 5 or 6 of them this weekend and had a blast - Sapphire is hands down the best stripclub in Vegas! Treasures and Rhino were cool and OG and cheetahs are dumps. I'm not gonna lie I was kinda into the chicks at Sapphire - i may need to go back =p
