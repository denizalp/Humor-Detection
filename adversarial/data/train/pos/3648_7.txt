Me: Well, let's try to find a coffee house close to downtown, since we have to be down there anyway.\n\nThanks to the Yelp app, we found this little spot that is located in the Emergency Arts building which also houses a number of galleries, including the Burlesque Hall of Fame.\n\nThe Beat has a nice inviting vibe to it.  The barista was friendly and had such a warm smile.  Seating consists of couches, tables, and some high tops.  We ordered two cappuccinos and grabbed a window seat.  Downtown Vegas is an interesting place, because a diverse mix of people walk the streets.  \n\nShe: Why didn't you tell me?  I wouldn't have come down here so early.\n\nI love listening to cell phone conversations!  Apparently the guy she was meeting was running late and she had been sitting alone for a while.  Eventually he showed up.  There was some interview being filmed outside, and then they moved in to the shop either to finish or just relax.  There are bins of vinyl records in the back which was fun to look through.  I hear actual records are making a comeback.\n\nThe coffee was very tasty!  They also offer beer, wine and food.  My favorite thing was the turntable right next to the register and playing something fun but the tip jar really made me laugh (picture posted).\n\nDefinitely a great place for coffee and to chill and relax.  I even bought a t-shirt from the burlesque shop....when in sin city!
