This place bills itself as a \"Ramen, Yakitori, and Sake Bar.\"  I've been here twice now for lunch to do my due diligence, so I'm updating this review.  This review is for the food, not the drinks.\n\nThe yakitori was great the first time.  The gizzard and heart and shishito peppers were particularly great.  The chicken was disappointingly overcooked and yet still lacking in grilled flavor the second time.\n\nThe sushi was fresh and good - I'd say on par with a place like Sakura in Squirrel Hill.\n\nNow, the ramen...\n\nWell, let's start off with a few generally accepted definitions (Google it, if you don't believe me!):\nRamen: A wheat noodle whose defining ingredient is an alkaline water solution that gives the noodles that distinctive springy bite and flavor.\nUdon: A typically thick, wheat noodle.\nSoba: Usually refers to a thin buckwheat noodle.\n\nNow, this place offers two options for their ramen: Udon or soba.  The owner seems to believe that udon and soba are both types of ramen, and was lecturing the waitstaff on this fact after two Asian ladies walked out upon discovering their ramen wasn't actually going to be ramen.\n\nAfter coming here a second time with a friend, I was pleased to discover their udon noodles are in fact udon noodles.  (We were accidentally served their soba instead of udon the first time.)  Unfortunately, their soba noodles are still neither soba (typically made with buckwheat) nor ramen (made with alkali).\n\nI've had both the miso and shoyu ramen now, and honestly suspect that they are both salted with both miso and soy sauce, because there's not much difference between them.  The broth is salted appropriately but a bit lacking in richness.  The pork is cooked well, but lacking in flavor.\n\nOverall - as a restaurant that bills itself as a \"Ramen, Yakitori, and Sake Bar,\" I was looking for good ramen and yakitori.  Since they don't actually serve ramen and their yakitori was inconsistent in quality, I give this place two stars.
