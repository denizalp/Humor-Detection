I was a frequent customer of this location from August 2009 to May 2012. The food is consistent. The restaurant is clean. The bathroom isn't gross. The staff is friendly. The manager is really nice. The cashiers laugh at my (lame) jokes.\n\nHowever, I graduated from ASU and I will never come back to this location. I never felt safe at this location because of the loiterers. There are always people outside who will ask you for money. I always felt uncomfortable whenever I told them that I have no cash (I only carry a credit card). These people will be outside at night too. There are non-paying customers who use the men's restroom. \n\nFinally, there are people who will go from table to table asking for some spare change to buy some food. I usually give them a dollar. My safety\/life is worth way more than a dollar. I'm sure that other customers feel pressured to give these people money too.\n\nI'm not a monster. I have voluntarily spent my own money to help these people. I don't mind spending a few dollars so another man won't feel hungry. I bought McDoubles, value drinks, chicken nuggets, tacos (from the Taco Bell that's next door), and McChickens to feed the people outside. In line, I once gave a middle aged man $5 when he told me he has been starving for days. He told me he was a Christian and I gave him another $5. He almost cried.\n\nI don't mind helping these people, but I never feel safe walking from the parking lot to the cash register. Management probably knows about these problems, but whatever they are doing isn't effective. This location is a safety concern for students who walk to this McDonalds at night.
