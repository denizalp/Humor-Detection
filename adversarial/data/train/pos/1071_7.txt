I use Yelp for a lot for the reviews.  I was very excited about trying FSY because of them.  Unfortunately, I cannot tell you how the classes are because I never got that far in the  process.  I went in to inquire and Sarah at the front  desk was so completely unpleasant that I asked only a couple of questions and left.  They really should have good customer service people if they want people to join the studio.  BAD first, and last, impression!
