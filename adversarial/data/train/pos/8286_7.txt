Thanks to Terri R., I know this place exists and they sell wonderful popcorn, something I don't usually buy.  Since I was going by today, I stopped to give it a try.\n\nI bought a small bag of Hot Stuff which is described as orange cheddar and jalapño and a small bag of La Famiglia--parmesan cheese, garlic, and onion.  I also got a small, complimentary bag of their mixed flavors.  \n\nI tried some of the mixed flavors and I had to open the Hot Stuff.  At first, I didn't think it was very hot.  Then the afterburners kick in and you taste the jalapeño.  \n\nWhile I may not be stopping here often, their product is great!  I wish I could get popcorn like this at the movies.\n\nAnd I'll end my review the same way as Terri--welcome to the neighborhood!
