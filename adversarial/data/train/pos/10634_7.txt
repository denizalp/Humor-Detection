Not the cheapest place in Chinatown - but the baked goods are decent.  Although, we were fortunate enough to catch a fresh batch of egg tarts still warm to the touch, it was a bit too wet and the crust was soggy.  It's your typical setup in Toronto Chinatown - walk around with a tray and tongs and pick up your own damned pastries and pay afterwards.  Personally - I like Ding Dong more just cuz it's so friggin' cheap -- but Furama just seems cleaner.\n\nBut I think I like place because of the 'cafe'\/seating area.  It full of old timers sipping milk tea and sitting there for hours because they bought an $0.80 pastry.  Oh - so many of my youthful years were spend in places like this when my dad understood 'look after the kids' as 'hang out with your chef friends, curse, smoke cigarettes, drink milk tea\/coffee, eat egg tarts and have little Johnson within an earshot'.\n\nWhenever I am at Furama, I try to make eye contact with one of the kids bored out of their mind as dad\/grandpa is nursing a drink and a bun.  I try to telepathically communicate with them... \"Stay strong, kid -- one day, you'll have money to eat all the egg tarts and cake you want, like me... and ya, we'll walk in the rays of a beautiful sun, too.\"
