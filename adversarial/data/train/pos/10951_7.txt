Restaurant with bad tasting water to me is always a bad sign. It tastes so bad almost made me gag. It had very strong bleach smell. My hubby ordered a lemonade and even that had very weird taste. BBQ pork dish I ordered was cold and it came with steamed pork cake & shredded pork which  were cold as well. My hubby ordered pho tai and the soup had weird after taste. I'm pretty sure they use the same bad water with their cooking. Not to mention their slow service and flies in the restaurant. We were very disappointed and will never return again.
