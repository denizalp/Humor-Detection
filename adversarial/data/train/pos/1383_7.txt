Hands down, my favorite sushi spot in Vegas. \n\nThe staff is amazingly friendly (and, if you are a regular like me, always seem so happy to see your face again) and their all-you-can-eat option is a crazy, awesome deal. You can easily eat $50+ worth of sushi for only $23.\n\nThe atmosphere is so-so and the place gets really crowded, but the sushi...\n\nI take all my out of town friends here. Why? Sun of the Beach. This is the GREATEST and most fantastically unusual sushi roll I've ever had. One bite and I was head over heels. I urge you to try it, but be warned - you may develop a rather serious habit. (I could stop if I wanted to.) Be sure to also try the sashimi salad. You'll definitely leave happy.
