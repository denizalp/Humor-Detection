Sad to find that this Mexican restaurant had NO gluten free options! Typically, most Mexican restaurants are safe for gluten free diets. However, I learned that this place dusts everything with flour! Why???? Everything is dusted with flour - the tortilla chips included! They definitely should rethink this flour on everything deal. This eliminates so many options for people looking to eat gluten free. \n\nThe only saving grace for this place was our server, Jennifer. She was super honest and attentive. Oh, and the location! It's right near the Southwest terminal and bathrooms.
