Ladys are friendly good customer service I got to say I been to over 15 boba places here in vegas. I tried the thai tea with boba and the drink was pretty good. Better than other places. The boba is good and soft. The thai drink was awesome. I didn't really sit in side just got it to go. Less than 5 mins the drink was ready.  I will defiantly come back to try others drinks.
