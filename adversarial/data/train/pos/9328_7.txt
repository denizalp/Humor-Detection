We went with friends this past Saturday night and I had the hangover the next day to prove it!  The wine is DELICIOUS and so inexpensive!  I think I had 6...or maybe 7 glasses.  They had live music and the tables were packed for a chilly Saturday night.  We didn't get any food (hence why I ended up so drunk) but I'm sure we will the next time we go.  I loved each glass I had but my favorite was probably the special blend.  It went down a little too easily -- yum!  We will certainly return and I look forward to seeing them at local wine festivals!
