So Majestique is a beautiful bar\/restaurant. The food is good and the oysters are fresh. Here's my problem. It's expensive and somewhat quite pretentious (i find). Yes, ok, the 12-inches hot dog is good. But is not because there's some fancy fried shallots and other fixings on top that it's worth 22$. We had a hard time in the beginning to get service due to the fact that the staff was busy greeting their friends and the regulars. The service needs to be improved because we felt that some waitress (there was only one that night) didn't really care about the patrons. The food portions are on the small size scale. Don't expect to be full unless you're ready to dish out serious money. We ended up going to Chinatown. No reservations are accepted so first come, first served. I don't thinks i'll be coming back here.
