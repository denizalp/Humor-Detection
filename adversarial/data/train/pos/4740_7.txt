Outstanding!  My first live Cirque show...expensive as fuck, but totally worth the money.  Who gives a shit if there were less acrobatics than at other shows?  I don't...the show was engaging, visually stunning (in a few spots, it's like you're trippin'), and very energetic.  Absolutely worth the money and time.\n\nGet your tickets online or through one of the places on the strip that sell tickets to get them for a discount.
