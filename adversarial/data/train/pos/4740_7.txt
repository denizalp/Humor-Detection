One star is only because our waiter was attentive and provided great service. \nFirst appetizer cheese plate, save your time and energy and get cheese at your local market you will get better quality. \nMy meal was the orange sea bass it came out extremely over cooked and dry. Such a disappointment when see bass is moist and normally melt in your mouth. My husband had the angus burger and he said it was fine not spectacular but fine. The guy singing is really good. I sent back my sea bass and it came back slightly better but not great and I became violently I'll within 5 min. Would never return.
