I was bummed when I heard AJ's was gone and this had taken its place.  But, wholly goodness, my mouth is watering just thinking about the meal I had at Rare 120 last night.  Summary:\n\n- Shrimp cocktail.  Large, tasty shrimp in individual cups of cocktail sauce.  Only 4 shrimp in the $20 order but they were damn good.\n-Seafood appetizer plater.  Kinda small but YUM. Shrimp, mini lobster (was it half a tail?  not sure...)\n-Mini soup plate with corn soup and tomato soup in mini espresso cups.  Interesting.  Good.  Small.\n-Filet \"lollipops\" that were on a stick.  Looked more like meatballs but the meat was cooked perfect and paired well with the sauce that came with it.\n-Skewers with asparagus, shrimp, and steak.  Very good. Served mini style but were very filling.\n\nEverything was really good - but small portions for the amount of money.  It was also very loud in there - and there isn't really a view of anything.  The restaurant itself is small too.  The decor is interesting.  Reminds me of gwen stefani \"rock steady\" album era.  Service was fairly quick and friendly.
