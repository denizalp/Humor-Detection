Receptionist is very rude and unprofessional. The firm didn't care about my case, they thought it was best to have the receptionist handle everything. She was rude, obnoxious, quick and arrogant, attorneys always deferred to her it seems. I never heard back and yet they always said they'd get back to me right away. I'm Still waiting! When I called back the amateur attorney\/receptionist acted as the litigator, judge and juror. Never Ever spoke directly with ANY Attorney. My request and attempts to speak with an attorney here where futile. I made 3 calls, no one Ever returned a call, Receptionist Handles Everything. Wow, a receptionist decides on cases, what a joke. The Wife\/Girlfriend wears the pants here !
