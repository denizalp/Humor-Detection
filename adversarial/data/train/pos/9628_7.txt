I see the many reviews and wonder if any of these people have had the opportunity to actually speak with Todd? Recently, I had a challenge with a maintenance issue. Todd could not have been more kind, understanding or considerate. He took my concern seriously, responded promptly and treated me professionally. \nI would definitely look at leasing another home from them in the future!!!
