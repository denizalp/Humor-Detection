In my culture woo refers to sloppy, unscientific thinking. Uncritically accepting ghosts, anti-vax claims, hair analysis for supposed mercury toxicity, using a poor understanding of quantum mechanics to shore up your belief in ESP... well that's Woo. Anyway, I've wanted to try Woo Buffet for some time on name alone. First, as I said it has \"woo\" in the name and that makes me giggle like a high school boy hearing your nun teacher saying \"ejaculation\" (which is actually a not dirty Catholic term the non-laid non-laity use http:\/\/catholicism.about.com\/od\/prayers\/g\/Ejaculation.htm). Second it has the word \"buffet\" in it which pleases that area a couple hand lengths above my groin.\n\nMmmmm. Buffet.\n\nI don't know if Woo means anything to CUTE! Chinese Girl but buffet to her means spending two hours eating desserts. I don't know where she puts it, either.\n\nTeamBuy voucher in hand we hit the Woo Buffet at the crack of 11:30 am. It wasn't quite open. And many of the dishes weren't out yet on the tables. And I found what looked like a long pubic hair on our table. And another weird black short hair on the plate. Sigh.\n\nI do like their plates, however. They are big and long. Ready to unload a full and dirty load right in your mouth. But, man, the kitchen staff need to shave themselves down there.\n\nThe food is about the quality of a three star Vegas hotel buffet. Great if you're comp'ed as part of your dingy cigarette ash and semen stained room but you don't want to pay full price for this. No way.\n\nBeing Sunday morning they had a selection of dim sum. The pork tasted like something died in my mouth although CUTE! Chinese Girl had seconds without complaint. So maybe I just don't have a correct attitude. The shrimp were pretty good although all vanished on my second trip. \n\nI'd bumping things up one star because the service is quite good, attentive, and friendly. Everything about this place says someone invested a lot into it (fixtures, lighting, mood, Yonge street side patio) but has walked away from it and it's running merely because the people there want their jobs.\n\nThis place could be so much more and might well have been so much more when it opened a couple years ago.
