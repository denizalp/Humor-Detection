The best way I can describe The Cosmopolitan is inconsistent.\n\nThe highs...The cool modern decor.  The free shows at the Book and Stage.  The Chandelier bar.\n\nThe lows...The inconsistent service, bordering on rude. The lack of focus on the details, I will explain.\n\nWe had never stayed at the Cosmo before, we had only gambled there a couple times.  We go to Vegas a lot (maybe every 2 to 3 months and pretty much always have free rooms at the Palazzo\/Venetian since we are Platinum grazie members.  Yes, I gamble way too much  ; )\n\nWe got an offer from the Cosmopolitan to stay free for a couple nights and while I felt like I was cheating on the Palazzo I gave them a try.  I really loved the feel there and it definitely extends up to their rooms.  We had a great room with a terrace overlooking the strip.  The room was on par with the level of the Palazzo\/Venetian and we enjoyed all the cool features.\n\nWere they go wrong is with some of their staff and the details through the hotel.  To start some of the cocktail service staff was just inconsistent and seemed really not to care to make the customer happy.  While I'm throwing my money away on their slots, that never payed off, I at least want a drink without an attitude.  I always felt I was inconveniencing them when I asked for a drink.  Now maybe they were still tired from the late night stripper gig, but not my problem.\n\nThe other miss was it seemed they were often not properly staffed.  From some of the restaurants to the bathroom conditions on the main floor of the casino.  I would expect more from a top level hotel in LV, especially with all the competition to get my gambling dollars.\n\nNow the sad thing is I got an another offer for a couple nights and $150 in slot credit and I'm not sure if I'm going to use it. I'm probably back to to my old faithful. Flings are usually just that...may be exciting at the beginning but when digging into the details is when you realize it is not meant to be. Also, the $500 in slot credit from the Palazzo helped twist my arm. : )\n\nIf you are there for a night at the club, drinks at a bar, or even some of the restaurants you will have a great time but staying for multiple days may expose some of their holes.
