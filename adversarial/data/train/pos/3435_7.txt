Went there to get a new set explained to the lash artists showed pic . 2 hours later she gives me mirror I almost screamed when I seen my self in mirror I looked like clown from a scary movie .... so what they did instead of fixing it the got attitude with me . How do you run a business like that no class . \nLet's talk about them talking Russian to each other ( they did not know I speak Russian ) was talking shit about the costumers laughing at them . On lash artist had a kid tuning around in the place . Mom was yelling at her telling her I will come there and kill you if don't sit there quiet , this is wile she is doing someone's eyelashes.....\nHorrible service horrible people that work there .....
