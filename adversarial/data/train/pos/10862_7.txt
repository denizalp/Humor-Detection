Eighty Acres is wonderful, and a very heartening - if ballsy - addition to this corner of the (greater) 'Burgh. Open for a mere nine weeks, they are fresh and the staff very friendly. In particular, the bartender Carrie is lovely.\n\nFor a late lunch, the fiancée and I started with the veal meatballs (a bright, flavorful sauce made the dish) and the Brussels sprouts, which were superb. The combination of flavors - sprouts, lime aioli, Parmesan and white anchovies - was brilliant. The anchovies (marinated, not the icky canned ones that everyone hates) really elevated it into something quite unique, and repeat trip-worthy.\n\nThe fiancée ordered the portobello and quinoa and I had the smoked duck quesadilla. His was a very respectful treatment of seasonal vegetables - not something you find often, or at such a reasonable price, around here. Mine was very smoky and rich. A touch more salsa added on the side cut through that richness to create a genuinely satisfying and thoughtful meal.\n\nEighty Acres, is a home-spun outfit, inspired by the chef's father's farm and enlivened by his long history in the culinary field. A veteran of the Coyote Cafe in Las Vegas and, more recently, the Tuscan Inn not too far away, Chef Don knows food and it is obvious that he takes the time to source high quality ingredients. We are very lucky to have him, and this restaurant, so close by.\n\nGo. Try something new. This restaurant is excellent, and a necessary addition to the Pittsburgh foodscape.
