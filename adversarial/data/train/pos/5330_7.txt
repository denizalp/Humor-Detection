A trip to vegas has to have a stop @ the Grand Lux Cafe!!!  I have nooo idea why i am so drawn to this place?!?!  After my bff took me here on my birthday trip I fell in love with this place and I can't wait to go back.  Sometimes I think of going to vegas just for this...but then with the help of wonderful YELP I found they have one in LA!!! I am going there the next time im LA ...which will be verrrry soon.  \n\nHowever I LOVE the food here everything comes out soo yummy! \n\n*APPETIZERs\nbuffalo chicken rolls, edamame, creamy spinach & cheese dip\n\n*SALAD\nSpicy Calamari Salad\n\n*MEALS\nSunday Night Pasta\nPasta w.chicken\n sun dried tomato & mushroom\nLemon Chicken Piccata (omg!)\nSalisbury chopped Steak ( this is gross anywhere else but SO yum here!)\n\n& there STRAWBERRY LAVA COLADA is sooooo yummmy!!!!!\n\neverything is so delicious.  One time we went with a party of nearly 20 and everyone was loving the food...!\n\nthe NEGATIVES...\n-the food i love isnt served all 24hours soooo if I came late nite (ok fine like 4am) theres no chicken picata or salisbury steak =(  however u can ALWAYS find something good\n\nthe entrance is EXTEMELY slippery!!!!! in fact the entire restuarant is really hard to walk on esp. with heels...its really insane how they made the ground however even if it means havin to fall on my ass and expose myself from my skanky vegas gear im all game...so yummmy!\n\n\nI dont know I guess the good food confused me but I didn't know it was connected with cheese cake factory! and ben f. made fun of me for not realizing!! im not to fond of cheesecakefactory but this place O M G
