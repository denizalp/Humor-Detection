Went there on a Friday night and it was super busy. But lucky for us we got seated right away at the bar. I had their spicy ramen w\/ an egg, corn and green onion. Their broth was way too thick and they don't give you enough of it. All my noodles soaked it up before I could even finish. On the side the bf and I shared their kimchee fried rice and I didn't care for it either. Over all I was not impressed and I feel like this place was hyped a little too much. I will give this place another try but not anytime soon.
