So as I get ready to go to Vegas I find myself once again in need to get my hair done. So I call for an appointment because last visit when I came here it was the highlight of my trip. Luckily I get an early appointment first one of the day for partial highlights. \n\nWhen I arrive to the salon I was pleasantly surprised to be greeted by Kelly Cardenas himself. OMG moment for me. The nicest down to earth person you have ever met. Wow! They had their stylists in for classes from their 5 locations. What luck for me as I got the best person to do my hair. I never had foils done so quickly. Usually it is long process which only makes me not want to go. \n\nNow  one of the best things here is the shampooing. You are brought in a dimly lit room very tranquil and again the best day of my life when it comes to a salon Kelly Cardenas also did my shampoo and neck massage. It was unbelievable at one point I was asleep, it was heaven. \n\nThan on to the finishing touches of blow drying. Let's just say it is amazing and everything here is a team effort. They make you feel like family. They were kind enough to pose for photos. Another Vegas trip that they made over the top. Prices are the same as South Florida surprisingly especially since the service is like no one else.
