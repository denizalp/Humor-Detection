Century Orleans 18 Movie Theater \n\nCentury Theaters has definitely stepped up their game.  It's been years since I watched a flick here and was very surprised with the upgrades that they have made over the years. You'll find reserved, comfortable, and reclining seats at this theater.  The Caf√© Bar is also stacked with goodies and proudly serves Starbucks.  \n\nHere are some tips...\n\n-Purchase your tickets online or get here early. The line gets long.\n\n-Bring a light jacket. It's cold in here.\n\n-Bring your patience if purchasing something at the snack bar. Zzzz! \n\n-Silence is golden. Turn off your cell phones.\n\n-Their Extreme Digital Theaters are powered by unicorns.
