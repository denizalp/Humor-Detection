Wow! the worst experienced ever in my life about restaurant.\n1\/ when you step in, they have weird decor that scare me away\n2\/ Very empty restaurant scary atmosphere\n3\/ the waitress warmed me that there is no insurance so they will not pay if anything happen to my nephew who was playing with the chopstick...OK...really rude!!!!\n4\/ No A\/C so fans were everywhere...\n5\/ They had Kobe beef for Pho but I heard it very expensive\n\nWe have pho and the food is actually very good but the environment and customer service make it hard for us to have a happy family meal here. We just swallowed our food asap to leave this crappy scary restaurant\/
