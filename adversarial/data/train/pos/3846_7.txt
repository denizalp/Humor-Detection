The Kuwait guy that is the barber on the first chair is extremely rude. The way he grabs your head and shook it around borders on assault. On top of that he presses the shaver down on my neck and told me not to move. He doesn't care about what you want he is just there to make money. My haircut today was the worse that I have ever had in my life. If you ever go there avoid the barber on the first chair at all cost.
