Yelp Challenge 365 #143\/365 (Las Vegas Adventures: First stop, Denny's)\n\nDenny's is the mainland Zippy's. It's pretty much a go-to if you are traveling especially since you'll see the signs \"Denny's, next three miles\"\n\nHowever, we didn't have to hunt around for it, thanks to Yelp and Google Maps! \n\nThe Highlights of our Denny's Experience\n\n- Located in the Tahiti Village and they have free valet (if you're too lazy to park your own car)\n\n- We were quickly seated \n\n- Service was quick and friendly since there was more than one waiter\/waitress to our table\n\n- Coffee and beverages were always refilled\n\n- Even though the restaurant quickly filled up, the staff including the morning manager made their rounds to everyone to make sure everyone was all right\n\n-Food was hot and fresh\n\nOverall, it was the team effort of the staff that made this experience enjoyable and relaxing especially since we just arrived in Las Vegas that morning.\n\nA big shout out to Ms. Karen Krym, the morning manager for Denny's on that Thursday morning! Thank you!!!
