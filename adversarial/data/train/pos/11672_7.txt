Pretty good local fish\/reptile store! I thought it's going to be a small store but surprisingly, they've got a ton of freshwater tropical fish and salt water fish and some corals. Not that much plants but they've got some nice breed, like rummy nose that I haven't seen anywhere else in cleveland. The goldfish they had are not that nice but I guess that's not their main focus of the store. If you are into reptile, they've got some turtles and snakes too. I wish they would carry some more freshwater plants, but pretty darn good as a local fish store!
