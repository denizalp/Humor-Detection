I was a BofA gal when I was in CA, but have since become a Chase gal in NV. \nThey first got me with their credit cards, specifically the Sapphire and now Reserve. \nNext, they got me a special offer to open a checking account, and now, I have a car loan and other accounts through Chase. \n\nI don't usually go inside to branches because I primarily use online banking (they have a very easy to navigate app). But of all the branches I've been to, this one does have really good customer service. There is usually someone at the front asking how they can help you, and they direct you to the counter services, or sign you up to speak with one of their bankers. \n\nThe banker I spoke to was patient and courteous when I asked my 101 questions. He even gave me good referrals for insurance and security. Next time I need to meet with a banker, I will make an appointment so I don't have to wait longer than necessary.\n\nIf you need a bank and relationship manager\/bankers, go to this location.
