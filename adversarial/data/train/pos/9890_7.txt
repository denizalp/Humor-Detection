A bit weird reviewing a medical facility and procedure, but hey, why not!\n\nKat covered things well, but it appears a couple things have changed since she had her ears jackhammered.\n\n1)  The \"use the Murray entrance\" late night time is now after 8pm.  You sign in through security, then head up the \"Murray Elevators\" -- don't use the University Elevators, as the friendly orderlies on Floor 5 will turn you away.\n2)  That Mt. Sinai card apparently isn't necessary now, even though it says it is on the form you receive in the mail.  I asked the tech and then the receptionist, and they both told me not to worry about it and head on home.\n\nI should also mention that my wait was decidedly short from the time of first request (end of May) to the time of my MRI appointment (tonight, August 16th).  I might have got in earlier had I not been camping up in Killarney a few weeks ago.  C'est la vie.  Considering mine is a non life threatening injury, I can't complain.  An MRI and knee surgery would probably run me 20k+ in US... I'm happy to pay my taxes in Canada and roll with the occasional health care punch!\n\nAs an odd little anecdote, I met Eric Lindros's uncle while waiting.  He was in for his hip.  Nice guy.  Kind of gleefully shared a number of conspiracy theories regarding the NHL, professional sports, and Eric himself.  I figure it was the Valium.  I also am inclined to believe most of them -- pro sports is a dirty industry.\n\nI'm also somewhat reassured that a successful dentist and relative to a famous hockey player was stuck waiting over an hour for his MRI due to a scheduling snafu, and had quite a few amusing love\/hate healthcare stories of his own.  No favouritism there!  Go Canada!
