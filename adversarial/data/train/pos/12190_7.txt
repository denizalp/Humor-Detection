Great ambiance , great place for drinks and free chips and salsa but that's it!!! The food is a big disappointment.  The dish was not as specify on the menu ,portion not match the price. \nI called the manager to complain, the manager decided to do absolutely nothing about it or even accommodate us or give us a substitute dish or compensation of dessert or anything in that matter.\nMy experience with Javier is that the manager named \"Leah\" definitely unexperienced and should not be a manager, she needs to look for a different type of job where she does not give  customer service.\nEven more disappointing is that this place is at the Aria Hotel where it's a five-star hotel where you would expect to have a five star restaurants with a five-star customer service. \nHope this review helps others who would be experiencing Javier restaurant.
