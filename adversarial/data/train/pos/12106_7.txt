Boarders Bookstores were always my favorite. I was so sad when they shut down. So now one of the few options for bookstores are Barnes and Noble.\nThey have actually gotten better I have to say.\nTheir selection is Awesome they have absolutely everything you could want.\nAlthough I did come here looking for a Barbie Classic Calender and they did not have it. They still have a great selection.\nBooks, Music, Dvd's, toys, A food and drink Cafe.\nIt is really very good. This one is in the Chandler mall and has lots of room to look around.\nThe day that we were there they had characters for the kids to see and get photos with.   They had Wonderwoman, Wolverine, and Spiderman. Spiderman had the best costumeexcept he was wearing the underwear shorts and you could totally see them through his costume.\n But, for kids I thought this was wonderful!\nI do like it here and there are wonderful books all around, which really makes me happy. I love Books ,all the electronic things are a bit sad I have to say.\nThey do even have a bathroom in the shop which is nice as well.
