I have a new favourite place in town and it goes by the name of Edelweiss Village\/Kaffe Stube. \n\nEdelweiss is THE biggest German store in our city, and THE biggest I've ever seen. They've got everything from German chocolate to German tabloids. They specialize in German imports and a visit is more of an experience than a shopping trip. \n\nTo add to their unparalleled selection of German goods, they have an in-store restaurant where you can eat cabbage rolls, Bratwurst and Schnitzel to your heart's content. They even have a vegetarian menu!!! Oh, and don't even get me started on their desserts. Seriously, just lock me in overnight with nothing but a fork. \n\nMy words can't possibly do Kaffe Stube justice, so I took a whack load of pictures so you can get an idea of what a jaw-dropping experience it is. \n\nHonestly - Edelweiss Village is my absolute favourite Calgary discovery so far!\n\nPicture time - see for yourself!
