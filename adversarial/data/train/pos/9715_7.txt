Hmm - what to say that hasn't been said already...\n\nCan't think of anything. So let me keep it short and sweet. It took me longer to find this place than it did to get our food. After all the carrying on I've heard and read about, I was expecting Narnia on a plate.\n\nIt wasn't, but it was pretty tasty fare for the price. I had - in order of supreme goodness - the fried chicken, sweet tea, waffle, and mac & cheese. Fried chicken certainly worth the trip. Sweet tea was amazing;  sweet without being sacchariny and blended so perfectly. Waffle was very nice but I've had better (overseas, to be fair) and the mac & cheese was saucy but unspectacular. \n\nCome hungry, make sure you know where the hell you are going, and give it a go.
