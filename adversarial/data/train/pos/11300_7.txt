It truly pains me to write a review this bad but sometime the truth just must be told. So, the cheese and charcuterie was actually quite good. The good news ends there. They only had one of their own beers on tap and don't can\/bottle anything if theirs even though the website shows 4 brews with can artwork...very misleading. The staff was a mess. It took, without exaggeration, 20 minutes for them to properly charge my card.  I mean at least if the vine was rad or the guest beers were solid it could have redeemed itself but it was just a fail. Should have definitely waited to open.
