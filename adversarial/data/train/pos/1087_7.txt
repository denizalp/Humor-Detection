$26 a person for unlimited brunch. Add $10 for bottomless mimosas\/Bloody Marys. Done.\n\nIt would take way too long to go into detail, but overall Wicked Spoon is one of the best buffets I have ever been to... and I normally don't even like buffets. Why? Because buffets usually mean quantity over quality. BUT at Wicked Spoon... mmm quality quality qua-li-tyyy!!!! While most buffets offer trays of food and serving spoons, a lot of the food at Wicked Spoon is pre-dished and portioned. I appreciate that.\n\nA few notable mentions are definitely the BONE MARROW (DUH, I must have had like 10 of these), the Asian section overall was just insanely good... nigiri quality on point!, and the gelato. MMM, the gelato.\n\nI usually don't leave buffets feeling great, but I actually felt satisfied without feeling overly stuffed when I left Wicked Spoon. Worth every penny.
