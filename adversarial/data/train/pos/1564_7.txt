Love the price of cigarettes, but as soon as I walked in the door an older women workin there stairs at me then walks up asks me for I'd so I went to hand it to her and she snatched it out of my hand. She then gave me a very dirty look because my I'd is a California I'd. I walk up to counter to tell the other girl wat I wanted, and she had an attitude as well... Prices are great, but the people that work there are extremely rude. I'd rather pay the extra 3$ and go to a gas station.
