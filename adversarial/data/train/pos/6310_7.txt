If and only if I could give them a negative star, I would.  I have been to this place a few times for 3 different weddings and please brace yourself for some very blunt brutal comments from the ladies at the shop.  \n\nService - 1\/5 \n- Depends.  I had good and bad experience from this shop.  But definitely the bad experience trumps it.  \n\nStore Selection - 3\/5 \n- There are quite a bit of selection, but it seems the selection mostly are from the 90s\n\nOne must understand that people come in different sizes and figures.  Who doesn't want to have a supermodel figure?  But for them to blatantly point it out, it is rude and unprofessional.  \n\n4 of us ordered the bridesmaid dresses, when the dresses came we all went back for a fitting.  So it might be coincidental that all 4 of us gotten fat in the last 3 months or they actually took the incorrect measurements to begin with.  Who knows!  I mean what are the odds of 4 girls gotten fat in the last 3 months knowing that there's a wedding coming up.  You do the math.  I mean, it's all good since we still have time to alter the dresses.  However, it's the fact that they also decided to announce our measurements out loud in front of other customers which is something none of us really appreciate.
