Who doesn't love Pop! This place is fantastic. The feels you get when you walk in brings back memories of your childhood (at least for me it does). \n\nThe owner Damien is very nice and helpful. Lots of pops to choose from so I was getting a little overwhelmed. But I was able to select 8 different types pop with all his help. Multiple candy options and fun vintage toys as well. \n\nTotally gave me ideas for future bday and Xmas gifts. Overall a very cool store.
