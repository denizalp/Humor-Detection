I don't wanna get off to a boring start on this review for this top of the line facility, buuuut....NOTE: If you want to make sure that all of their facilities are up and running for the day, just call their number: 866-782-0655. Sometimes during off season they'll be doing maintenance on the steam room\/whirlpools, etc. Just a precaution because each part of this spa really matters! \n\nI cannot fully express my love for this spa's facilities. Take note...FACILITIES. My 5-star rating (which I'm typically stingy with) is for this area only, as I have had two massages here and they were two stars at best. Skip the massage unless you like to have excessive amounts of oil rubbed on your skin with nearly no pressure (and I'm pretty sensitive to pressure, so there definitely wasn't much to it). \n\nNow, let's get down to business. Located on the second floor of the Augustus tower, just approach the desk and ask for a day pass. While steep on the price list ($45), it is worth every single minute that I worked to make that money. This grants you access from early in the morning (6 or 7) until they close (maybe 7 or 8? I haven't been there that late). As soon as you walk towards the actual spa, the hallway has a tranquil and serene mood about it and is immediately calming. Enter your respective spa, you go give the attendant your information, and you're granted some comfy sandals and a user-friendly, electronic-locking locker. Inside is your plush robe. \nTIP: Do not be afraid to ask for a tour! It can be easy to miss the \"Roman Baths\" at the front of the spa. The attendant will explain all of the areas to you and it does make for a much better experience if you haven't been before. \n\nTea\/Relaxation room: Selection of half a dozen teas or so, but the fridges built in under the counter have bottled water and  a selection of different juices. There is assorted fruit and bags of pretzels to choose from for snacks. This room has a TV  and primarily serves as a lounge. \n\nSteam Room: Perfect temperature and I appreciate the inclusion of eucalyptus oil for the sinuses! Two levels for seating. Just make sure the door closes all the way, sometimes it seems like it can get stuck while closing and then the steam escapes from the room.\n\nArctic Ice Room: Great concept, but could have had better execution. This is a great place right after the steam\/sauna as it is a slight shock to the body and skin. The \"snow\" falling from clearly isn't snow (more like foam bits), but applause for at least some effort. I don't recommend eating the ice if it's been in the dish as this isn't the most sanitary option. Just press the button and put your cup underneath the ice-chute. \n\nWet sauna: Mostly a place to get that close shave. I don't really ever go in here. \n\nSauna: Nothing out of the ordinary. \n\nTraditional jacuzzi: This is a larger than average whirlpool and is the only chlorinated option in the place. Spot-on temperature and two chairs to relax on before\/after.\n\n\"Roman Rituals:\" This is a large room right inside where you walk into your respective gender's door. This is the largest single area within the spa, with three different pools of water. There is a TV in here as well and I enjoy catching up with ESPN while soaking. Instead of chlorine, each pool utilizes different minerals, yada yada yada. \nIn the middle, the \"tepidarium\" is filled with mid-90 degree water and feels lukewarm. Relaxing, and there are sunken in \"beds\" on one end which are neat to sink into. \nTo the left, the \"caldarium\" is more jacuzzi-like and has the hottest water of the three. Low-100 range, but the end of it is against a wall with water flowing down into it that is cooler. My favorite of the three.\nTo the right, the \"frigidarium\" is the whirlpool I do not enter into...WAY too cold for some reason (UHH, probably because it feels like you take a mini trip to Antarctica when your skin touches the water!)\nSituated along the walls are around 6, contouring, stone in-lay chairs that are incredibly comfortable. I've accidentally fallen asleep on these and taken an hour nap or so. Whoops. There are also some other chaise lounge chairs on the other side.\n\nThe vanity area is well-equipped and generally clean, and the showers have several nozzles-- although, I can only ever seem to get half of them working at once. \n\nAll in all, Qua does almost everything right (and then some) when it comes to their top-notch spa. While I won't return for a massage or any other service, their facilities keep me as a repeat customer.
