I was pleasantly surprised by this chain! I don't like fast food and I don't like fast asian food at that. There's like 3 of these in the financial district and this is the one I usually go to. The ladies working here are efficient and nice! They're always offering samples.\n\nI like getting the old noodle+one veggie item - their tofu is super good! Mooooist as frack. I highkey like it. As for the noodle, I get the curry one and that one has just enough spice flavour for a nice kick. There's also egg noodle and rice I believe. As for veggie options, there's beans as well. I don't know about meat options but my colleagues got some chicken thing that they said was great.\n\nThe portions are HUGE. $8-9 and you don't need to eat for a good 3 days because it's just soooo much food! Damn. \n\nI approve! Definitely would grab this if you're looking for some asian flavour during lunch.
