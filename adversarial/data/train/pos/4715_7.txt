From an adult, sans-kids perspective:\nThe newest parts of the zoo were nice. I mainly went to see the new tiger exhibit. I saw two tigers, which at the time were mostly stationary. But there is a very spacious area for the tigers including it looked like an overhead walkway for the tigers. \n\nPerhaps more than that I liked the giraffe area. There is a very cool observation platform that put my 6' tall self basically eye to eye with the giraffes. For $2 you can get some lettuce to feed them. \n\nThe final highlight was the elephant enclosure. I was a bit disappointed with the thickness of the landscaping separating the enclosure and the viewing areas. I vaguely remember there being less of it pre-remodel. In any event the area was nicely done and a large improvement over the former space. \n\nAll in all I was left hoping for a bit more value out of the experience. I definitely think there is room for progress with the space available to the zoo. Perhaps a combination of more exhibits, more signage and more value added experiences will make the zoo even better in the future. For what it's worth, at various exhibits there were zookeepers with skeletons and other hands on exhibits on carts that might have interested kids. \n\nThe zoo was very clean. The landscaping and exhibits were well maintained. There were tram routes to get you to the far flung areas of the zoo, including from the parking lot. There was an (over) abundance of fast food type places to get food throughout the zoo and plenty of seating. \n\nI want to revisit and try the Inside Tracks behind the scenes experience ($50) and see if that adds any value for the adult visitor.\n\nAs for the separate rainforest, the space is very small. You can walk through in under an hour for sure. There were monkeys that can be viewed from both the upper and lower level which were interesting. There was an interesting mix of other exhibits including porcupines and parrots.
