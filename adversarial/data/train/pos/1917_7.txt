YELP 365 CHALLENGE 2014-(181\/365) \"Kids Do The Darndest Things!?!?\"\n\nWhen I hear Victoria's Secret, I immediately think bras, panties, lingerie, you know? Women's stuff...I had no idea they had a teeny tiny section for men's fragrances!?\n\nWhile Wifey was checking out some stuff, I  just dabbled in the Men's cologne area \nwhich had about three different scents. Of all three, I liked Very Sexy Platinum one the best. Who knows? I may just return to pick up a bottle one day. The service here is pretty good up until you get to the cashier. Ladies try to get you to sign up for a credit card which can be pretty annoying.\n\nTip for parents with kids too...be with your child at all times, otherwise they may risk serious injury from LYING DOWN ON THE FLOOR when people are shopping!?!?!?  ALOHA!!!\n\nShaka Meter:  \\uuu\/  \\uuu\/  \\uuu\/  3
