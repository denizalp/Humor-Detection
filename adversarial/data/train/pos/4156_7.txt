I'm torn between a 4 and 5 star rating but going to go with 4 because I've only been once. If the next time I'm at least as impressed as the first I will up the star count.\n\nI came across this place one day when I was in training nearby and had about an-hour-and-a-half to kill for lunch. I checked my handy-dandy Yelp ap to satisfy my Indian craving and was drawn here by the great reviews.\n\nAs far as my lunch buffet experience here goes... wow. Just, wow. The place was bright, clean and well laid out. There were more options than I'd ever seen at an Indian buffet including a breads area, a salad bar, a hot meat entree table and a hot vegetarian entree table. All of the items that I tried (no meat) were decent to great, with the exception of the saag which tasted like it came out of a can. I appreciated that they brought a pitcher of water to the table to pour at my leisure. The staff that I encountered were all polite and efficient.\n\nI can't wait to go back. Nom, nom, nom!
