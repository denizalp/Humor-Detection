Best Juices. [because they are fresh]\nGood Food. [because it's vegetarian, and this place is run by veggies who care.]\n\nPoint off, because sometimes the staff's that stuffy [i'm better than you vegetarian types].\n\nOtherwise, all round good. Oh and a point off because I like meat, and can be biased in my review on a vegetarian place.\n\nI recommend this place for fresh juice. Delicious food [with no meats]. Good for lunch.
