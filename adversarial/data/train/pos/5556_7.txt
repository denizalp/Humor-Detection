The desecrate ones are always the good ones. This amazing Cambodian restaurant is Phoenix hidden gem. The past few years I have eaten here I have not blessed this restaurant with my feedback. Now is the time to share with you my Yelp friends this place is amazing. The savory taste of real comfort food is here.\n\nA good friend introduced me to this spot years ago. My first dish was back in 2015 and it was the Lemon Grass Chicken. Amazingly flavored in every bite. The rice is from Cambodia served fresh with your dish. I officially joined the clean plate club that night.  The dining experiences after lead me to ordering the same thing for a while. Then I dared to try something new and was pleased by the ginger beef. It melts right in your mouth. Or the Beef lok lak which is a salad but also comes with rice. My friend is hooked on the egg rolls that they make fresh daily and the Beef and Shrimp noodles. \n\nEverything I have tried has been amazing. No complaints at all. Now this place is run by three people. A family business with mom and pop cooking while the son serves. Service will be slow but worth the wait. You can sip on some tea or the variety of drink options they serve. Perfect place for a date or just to have a casual conversation.
