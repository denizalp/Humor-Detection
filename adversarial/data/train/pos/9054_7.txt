Son of a biz...freaking Yelp kept thinking backspace meant \"leave this page\"...it erased about five paragraphs...and they were witty too...hopefully I can come up with some new stuff.\n\nWent here with the magnificent Magic, as she wanted to try it out. Indian food is quickly becoming my second favorite cuisine...so I was happy to accompany her. \n\nThere's a nice big sign out front, so it's easy to spot...there's also parking in the back...off street...if you're daring enough to navigate the narrow alley to the back of the building in your car. If you have a Hummer, I wouldn't try it (I'd also suggest re-evaluating your life, if that's the case).\n\nThe inside is spacious and bright, but kind of strange...kind of sparse...and there's carpet, which attracts more bacteria and germs than a hobo's ass. But, I have faith that they'll keep it clean.\n\nThe server was pleasant, as was the owner, who came out a couple times to check on us. He seems like he really wants to make this place work! Which is good.\n\nThe food was a good start. I had one of my favorite dishes, Chicken Madras. It was missing the normal stewed tomatoes, but not missing any flavor. The chicken was perfect.\n\nI think Magic had the Chicken Vindaloo...also awesome. The rice was good, the nan was great too.\n\nDidn't check out the bathrooms, as I didn't have the need...which, in an Indian place is a good sign. \n\nIt's a bit east of Gordon Square, about a block from the Happy Dog...so, after dark, it's not the best location (know a guy who was beat within an inch of his life about a month ago on that very block, around 10:30pm)...but perhaps if more places like this open, that will change. I keep wishing that Cleveland would start doing the right thing and build out from center, rather than these outposts of civilization, but...what can you do? \n\nOr at least, what can I do until I'm elected mayor in 2024?\n\nThat said, I'll ABSOLUTELY be back. The food was definitely enough to warrant a return visit, and the pleasantness of the owner added to it. Not a five star rating, not even close, but a solid place that fills a gigantic need on the Near West Side.
