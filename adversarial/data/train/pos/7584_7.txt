We stayed about 4 nights at Le Meridien Versailles and in the dead of winter. It was SO cold! Well let's get down to the nitty gritty, it's in the heart of downtown in Montreal. It's a 5 minute walk to the subway which is super convenient. There are a variety of food places nearby but a lot of the higher rated places are further away but it's not too hard to just pop into the subway.\n\nThe one quip we had about this place as that our heater was just non-functioning. We called about it and they gave us a TINY space heater and let's just say in the subzero weather, it's not enough. We figured the heater situation out and we had to open and reset the heater every night so that we could get the heater working...not sure why this wasn't set in the first place but it's not okay especially when you're rudely awaken in the night because it's freezing cold. The heater is also loud as it's one of those old heaters just covered in a \"modern\" look.\n\nOther than that, everything else was just okay there was also stains on the carpet which were...questionable. Would we stay here again? Maybe but never again in the winter.
