Cheesesteaks, cold sandwiches, and fries- simple but tasty menu, complete with a drive thru. Get your sandwich with american, provolone, or whiz, and add on onions. If you're really feeling dangerous, they also have pizza fries. Everything is made fresh and fast at this family-owned business.\n\nEDIT: Dropping a star. I don't come by regularly but the second and third experiences were drastically different from the first. Food's still good but service leaves something to be desired, which is surprising considering they have sign spinners out to drive in more business.
