Used to go to Miga, which stood in the same place as Arisu today. Assuming that it was run by the same people, I expected an enjoyable dining experience tonight. Well ...  Arisu is apparently run by another owner and has no ties to former Miga in any way, shape, or form. \n\nAs it's called an izakaya, I expected a lot of Japanese tapas with a selection of drafts on tap. The quintessential yakitori sticks were nowhere to be found. The bar menu was scant and pricey. The Korean BBQ was bland and rubbery.\n\nMy experience here was hardly worth the price I paid. It doesn't cost an arm and a leg, but the bill is still substantial.
