I've ordered take out and dined in several times- this place is not recommended for people looking to be \"healthy\"!  Every time I go here I think I'll get a salad but then I read the menu and get a burger instead! \n\nLast time we tried zinburger was a double date- we ordered truffle fries and sweet potato fries for the table.  The boys had beer which zinburger had some nice options on tap.\n\nFor food my date and I decided to share the farm salad which really was quite good!  The burger we shared was a spicy one diablo?  We ordered it medium which it was cooked properly with a chipotle aioli and jack cheese.  There was too much runny sauce all over the burger but it tasted great.\n\nNext time I want to try a milkshake- they have several gourmet options!
