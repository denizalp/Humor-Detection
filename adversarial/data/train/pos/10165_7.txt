First off not pork it's chicken. I ordered a pork green chili fry bread taco. It came as chicken which they insisted was pork. I have worked in the industry long enough to know when I see chicken skin in it that it is not pork lol. The fry bread is very thin with no real substance to it. The chips and salsa are decent. Place is clean. Then order was wrong and had no green chili. Was nice enough to replace with shredded beef tacos. I am going to try those and finish the review in a sec. tacos are big with plenty of meat. They are just dry. If you add the salsa it is pretty good. The beef green chili fry bread is pretty good. You can get only one soda refill. Plain fry bread is pretty good just a little on the thin side.
