Overwhelmed. So. Much. Chocolate. Such were my feelings the minute we walked in here on a Saturday morning.\n\nFirst, the parking situation. We found free street parking on a residential street a couple of minutes away.\n\nSecond, the environment. Note that seating is limited. Environment is very old-school, not modern at all. A basic counter with about 5 stools is at the very front if you decide to eat in. There's also a couple of tables off to the side. Towards the back, lighting is very dismal. We were fine eating in by the stools at the front on the sunny morning we visited, but I would understand why most people would rather grab and go.\n\nThird, the products. There were trays upon trays and racks upon racks of truffles, a whole case full of a variety of cakes, chocolate ice cream bars galore. We ordered a slice of the Pistachio White Chocolate cake, and it was surprisingly so light and quite delicious. The cake itself was very fresh and soft, it was clearly baked that morning. The frosting wasn't too sweet at all, and didn't taste artificial, which I loved! It was a great surprise to find such quality cake! I wouldn't hesitate to get this again.\n\nFor our slice of cake, we paid around $4.00. If we're ever in the area again, we would definitely consider going back try try out other cakes - and perhaps their ice cream this summer as well!
