I usually order (and love) their shrimp burrito (i always order with avocado)...most time it is very good sometimes just good.  I went there today, and would rate 3 stars based on today's experience  (the flour tortilla was a little hard, generally didn't taste as fresh).  I am giving a 4 because it is usually much better.  The service is always great too - I believe 3 sisters own the place. \n\nLast time we went on 10\/23,  the Food Network was filming there- the film crew mentioned they would be profiling this place (showing in the spring) along with Matt's Big Breakfest in the Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives show.
