We just got back from our first meal there. No it wasn't great food but it was good. I had the chicken fried steak and my wife had the pot roast. She liked the chicken fried steak best and I like the pot roast best. Pretty good swap. Portions were good size but not overly so. The service was fine, quick and friendly without be intrusive. All in all it was a positive experience.
