I'm embarrassed to say that I let my vanity get the better of me and purchased the L'core \"instant eyelift\" cream from a mall in Las Vegas. $400 bucks! What can I say, I had had a couple of drinks, was in a great mood, and the guy who did the demo made me look incredible. \nHowever, the next morning my instant eyelift cream was unable to lift my middle aged eyes even one millimeter regardless of how much of the stuff I applied. I'm not sure if the cream they give you for the demo is different than what's in the jar they sell, but it doesn't work.\nI tried to get a refund, but was told that all sales are final. The company phone number is a cell with no outgoing message. I disputed the charge on my credit card, and am waiting to hear the resolution. \nL'core is like one of those con artists from the 1800s who traveled across the country selling sugar water to na√Øve townspeople telling them it would cure their gout or whatever. L'core is a huge rip off. Stay away!
