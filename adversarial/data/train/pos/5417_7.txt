Met up here with the crew this past Sunday, for one beer and some comical people watching.\n\nThis place used to be a favorite hang out for me, years ago when the majority of the bikers were true and gritty.  There were fewer posers back then.  You know the guys I'm talking about.  The ones who wear the perfectly matched bandana with obnoxious Ed Hardy\/Affliction\/Tap Out muscle t-shirts, fake bake tans, blingy jeans, tweezed eye brows, perfectly coiffed goatee and excessively expensive clown bikes that scream \"look at me and how much I spent on this bad boy\", sporting 22\" plus rims that are great for local bar hop posing, provided they can make super wide turns around a corner and climb a not so steep driveway, all the while sucking on a big fat cheap cigar like an equally cheap insecure porn star.  Some of the gals are equally entertaining, with their store bought bolt-ons, botox, plastic inserts, excessively colored hair, blingy bling bling jeans, leathery sun damaged skin and more.  Sadly, the ratio of real bikers to posers has changed beyond comical.  This would be a great place for casting the next reality show about wannabe bikers.  Luckily, their idea of going for a ride, means riding to the local Chuy's for bike night or a bar that isn't more than 20 miles away.\n\nEither way, go check out the Hideaway.  Have your beer or two, enjoy the live music and the very entertaining people watching, then jump on your bike and go grab lunch at Harold's, or better yet, loop the long way down to San Tan Flat in Queen Creek, or the Road Runner or Chilleen's or Sidewinders.  The posers won't be at those other places because it's too far of a ride for them and the parking lots aren't paved. ;-P\n\nHahaha.  Good times in the Sonoran Desert.  Good times indeed.
