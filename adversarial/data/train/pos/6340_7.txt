I am obsessed with Pokeman. Literally obsessed. I come here once a week, but would probably live here if it was closer to my work. I'm no expert on poke but I feel like the ingredients here are just more fresh here. Like, fresh and crisp taste.\n\nI always build my own bowl at poke places. I find that they contain too many proteins and\/or ingredients and sauces that cover up the freshness of the fish. I get the medium bowl, which is kinda piggy of me, if I'm being honest but it's so damn good! I'll usually choose tuna and salmon. I've tried most of their sauces, but spaishi is my fave. I'll add some avocado, edamame, red onions and cucumbers and I am good to go!
