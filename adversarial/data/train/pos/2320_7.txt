Surprisingly Fun\n\nIf you are in Phoenix, enjoy cocktails and enjoy small bars, than the Undertow is a must. The Undertow is a 100% bonafide tiki bar. This place is extremely small but very popular and its suggested that you make a reservation. The Reservations are for 1.5 hour slots, which is plenty of time given how strong their cocktails are. \n\nThe music, atmosphere, staff and drinks are superb.  There are lots to choose from the cocktail menu and the staff are friendly and fun. You need to check this place out.
