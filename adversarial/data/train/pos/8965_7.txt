I had the pleasure of experiencing this place last summer when I lived in Toronto.  The hubs would come to visit every weekend and we would cruise the town looking for places to eat that we can't get back in Michigan.\n\nWe both loved Korean Grill House.  There are multiple locations, and we went to the one at Yonge & Bloor.   It's a clean, cozy little joint that slaps you in the face the minute you walk in with it's yummy teriyaki smell.  \n\nI had no idea what I was doing but the server was very friendly and helpful, and showed me how to use the little grill at our table.   Of course you need to get the all-you-can eat options because if you don't eat yourself sick, you haven't really lived.  \n\nThey provides a wide selection of meat and vegetables that you can grill.  I stuck with the steak, chicken, pork, and lamb because the seafood stuff looked weird.  The shrimp kept staring at me and it gave me the creeps.\n\nEverything tasted fabulous and it was fun to prepare your own stuff.   The hubs kept slapping my hand away from the grill as he felt the need to maintain his grilling master status.   Our server would clear our empty food dishes, and replace them with more slabs for us to throw on the grill.   The server was incredibly quick and efficient with our refills on both drinks and food.  \n\nI had never eaten at a place like that before so it was a fun, unique experience.   I would have given 5 stars but I had to take one away because of that darn shrimp who's eyes still haunt me.
