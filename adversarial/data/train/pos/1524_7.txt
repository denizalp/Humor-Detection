Great Experience with Kitchen remodeling. We did out counters with them very recently. The crew they used were really great (except the plumber - advice that you get your own - we tried his and ended up with moonvalley)\n\nTristan goes the extra mile in customer service. Rochelle is very prompt and is always delivers on time.  We felt absolutely no pressure on their sales and their pricing was reasonable. Work was fast on time work.\n\nI would have liked a little more transparency on how they calculated the pricing.
