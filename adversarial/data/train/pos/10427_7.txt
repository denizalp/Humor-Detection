In a rush and need some coffee, but you're too impatient to wait in line at the Pantry or too lazy to head back to the Starbucks in the maze that is every Strip casino. Congratulations, you've settled.\n\nThe Roasted Bean offers pre made food options, breakfast sandwiches, and pretty much anything that any other coffee shop offers. What may surprise you here are the prices, a large Iced Americano and veggie Panini cost me just under twenty dollars with a tip. \n\nThe iced Americano was actually pretty good and tasted better than most Starbucks' Iced Americanos that have sucked down these many years. The veggies sandwich on the other hand seemed old and needed some dressing or even hot sauce. It was just plain and dry and for 7 bucks, I kind of needed more. \n\nThey also sell t-shirts that say, \"I got Roasted at the Roasted Bean\". I'm kidding, but that would be pretty cool.
