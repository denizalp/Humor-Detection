For the most part, I've had a good experience overall. We've been going here since they opened- so far, so good. It's a pretty good pizza for 7.95! I haven't had much else, although the wings were alright the time or two that I had them. I stick to the aforementioned one topping pick up special. They're also pretty good about complimentary paper plates, which come in handy on pizza night. Having a decent pizza at that price, I don't expect too much else so I'm happy with that.
