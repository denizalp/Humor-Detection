Went into Red Mountain Weight Loss fro my one month follow up appointment. I am giving this visit 3 stars because I was disappointed that we did not do another picture, BMI Measurement, and they seem disinterested in receiving my monthly list of weight loss. I was also disappointed that my appointment was scheduled for 6:15pm and I was not seen by Ginger, NP until 6:50pm. RM has many rules and fees regarding patient appointments and it would be nice to have mutual respect regarding appointment times. Not a huge issue, but perhaps a small gesture of a $25 discount on services when the provider is late is appropriate. Afterall, RM wants to bill us when we disrupt their schedule... Just a thought...\n\nOverall I am very satisfied with the Weight Loss I am achieving with Red Mountain. My NP I saw last night, Ginger, was a sweetheart... A little rushed as she quickly reviewed my chart in the room with me, but that was not a huge issue as I am just there for a weight loss follow up. \n\nI look forward to shedding some more LB's!!!!
