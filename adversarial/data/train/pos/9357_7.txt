Passages is just amazing. I got a small simple tattoo however the entire experience was great. From the consultation to the tattoo itself, everyone in the shop is so welcoming and it's just a great vibe. Kevin did my tattoo and he is awesome and so friendly. Thanks a bunch!! Passages is the best for a reason.
