Gabi is mi amiga, my bestie, my BFF, as well as Mon Ami.  Eating on the patio is the best, a transport to Paris.  The patio is an absolutely fantastic place for people watching.  It's right on the Las Vegas Blvd, with an amazing view of the Belagio fountains...and even on the hottest of days, some of the best misters spraying down some welcome coolness.\n\nThe food is wonderful, and the service lovely.  I've tried a half dozen or so items, but always seem to return to my favorite - steak and pomme frites.  AWESOME.  I also love the Brie Burger, which is very tasty, and the secret...shhhhh...herb butter placed inside the patty before they cook it.  It oozes was flavor!  Très délicieux!\n\nLove love love the shredded carrot salad that served with their fresh, warm baguette.  It's definitely the best darn bread I've had outside of Paris.  \n\nThe wine list is impressive.  It has very reasonable wines by the glass, too, so as to fit into any budget.\n\nAmong all the places I've eaten at it Vegas, this is always really consistently great, and when you mix in the outdoor patio experience - it's one of my favorites.
