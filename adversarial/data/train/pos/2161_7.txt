Shilla Forilla! Prepare to sweat peeps, it gets smokin' hot in here! Summertime, 100 degree afternoon, plus tabletop grilling, should include A.C. right? Sadly this place is old school like that, so the A.C., well, was nonexistent.\n\nIt's a good place to come on discounted terms, but we won't be back anytime soon since it's at regular pricing now. \n\nWe were lucky enough to try out their grand opening Lunch Special $12.95 AYCE BBQ - we were hesitant to try the sushi since it was just way too hot in there. The honest truth is, we would only eat here again if the prices stay that way. The regular pricing is absurd. The meal isn't worth that much, it's average. \n\nWe ended up with the poorly designed gold plated grill and it was also tiny. You can barely fit your meats on there, let alone the veggies that come on the plate. Also, it burned quickly. Oh wells, at least they changed the grills out if needed. \n\nThey don't have duk bo sam (rice noodle squares) or the vinegared radish sheets to legitimately wrap up your meats and sides, but they do offer rice. In the end, we didn't miss it all too much. \n\nHere's what we selected from the lunch AYCE menu: \n\nAPPETIZERS:\n- Gyeran jjim (steamed egg souffl√©) - the egg was very fluffy, airy, delicate and flavorful. I enjoyed it.\n- Doenjang ji gae (soybean paste stew with tofu, vegetables, beef) - on the weaker and watery side, but it was still piping hot and perfect to sip and wash down the greasy meat. \n- Gyoza (dumpling) - hot and crispy, but the filling was boring. I wouldn't order this again, it's just a filler.\n- Japchae (sweet potato noodles mixed beef and vegetables in season) - the noodles and vegetables were cooked well and plentiful, but it was bland. We drizzled some of the gyoza sauce on top, mixed it up and voila! It was awesome! \n\nMEATS:\n- Bulgogi (thinly sliced eye beef marinated in bbq sauce) - the meat was mildly seasoned but it was tender.  \n- Yangyum galbi (short rib marinated in bbq sauce) - this was the best cut of our meal. Tender and lightly seasoned. Dip it into the seasoned sesame oil for a flavor explosion! \n- Samgyubsal (think sliced pork belly) - not terrible, but pretty chewy.\n\n**they didn't have usamgyop available (Kobe beef belly) :(\n\nBANCHAN:\n- The sides were all super bland and lacking so much flavor. The best one had to be the Kimchi, but it was weak. We ended up grilling them and they tasted so much better! \n- Salad - the dressing was great. Very flavorful, tangy, and well seasoned. \n- Sauces were decent, but you need to ask for the seasoned sesame oil with salt and pepper. It really turns up the bland meat and wakes up the flavor!\n\nThe service was friendly but chaotic. It's hard to get anyone's attention when you need something. We had to yell loudly a few times since they couldn't even hear us over the loud grills. They forgot to bring us our rice that we ordered, but we ended up not needing it anyways.
