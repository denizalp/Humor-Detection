i'm doing it. Going all out and saying FIVE STARS! Yup, the best of the best. I've been here 4 times already (1 breakfast, 1 lunch and 2 dinners). Every single meal was delicious. Every single experience was refreshingly authentic. It reminds me so much of a cafe in Paris. The staff is great and attentive. The food is fresh and tastes.....wonderful. Last night, we started with the warm brie and toast. It was just mouthwateringly fantastic. The carmelized garlic pieces were so good on the bread. Just wow. I believe there was a touch on honey too, so you get the sweet garlic, the warm brie, the crunchy bagette slice and a touch of honey...can you say YUM!\nI had the stuffed vegetables for dinner which was great. The quinoa was tasty, the veggies were cooked perfectly and stuffed with love! We ended our dinner with the Sour Cream Ice Cream and Grand Marnier soaked strawberries. WOOOOOOW. I'm going to say it again, WOOOOOOW. That was so refreshingly. Tart and sweet, cold and tasty, just a lovely blend of flavors. On top of all this fantasticness, I was there with my girl Molly T! We had an awesome time peopel watching, having some laughs, and eating great food. I highly HIGHLY recommend this place.
