bad customer service !!!! this wendy's @ this location is a fucking joke excuse my language but its the truth.. the bitches there are so freak in lazy so is management.. well the time of my wendy's experience was about 1:30pm thursday august 07\/2008 at the north las vegas location..  this is what happened first i went through the drive th ru to place my order , my order was chic nuggets , jr bcb , fresh french fries. the bitch act like she could not here me so i took my ass inside.. place the same order so the lady who was taken the order at the drive th ru heard me placing my order with the cashier in the front so she starts to give me my same order .. so i ask her if my fries are fresh , she said \" what\" i ask her again , she act like she did not understand so i had to break the definition down to her , fresh meaning just came out of the oil .. she said i know what it means \" the bitch didn't act like she knew what it meant.. always a instant attitude at this location all the time , when i request fresh fries what is the problem i am paying my money for fresh fries i already know that its going to be a 2min wait who cares.. and of coarse the bitch was black ... black with an attitude .. i never have this problem at macdonald's , kfc when i want something fresh i already know there's going to be an automatic wait.. this location is always a problem very bad service .. there was about 5 black girls working with attitudes. even the manager had an attitude. the cashier inside who took my order was very nice and polite.. i even tipped her $3.00 management\/employees\nneed to go back to customer service training..  .. what employees are really to comfortable and  forgot how to treat the customers..\n time for them to go..\nthere giving wendys a bad rep..\ncorporate needs to come and do a sweep..\n\n\nsincerely\ndisgruntled customer\nnorth las  vegas nv\n\n\nwendy's \n1301 w craig rd, \nnorth las vegas, \nnv 89032
