This place has to be the worst and dirtiest place in town. I have driven by this place my whole life and today I said they have to be doing something right over there cause they have been here for 40 years . How they have been in business this long is beyond me. I'm Italian and I'm embarrassed for these people. This is the worst sandwich, pasta, salad, macaroni salad, and pizza. I'm so mad they have $16 of my money. I wish I would have lost that money so at least I could be happy for making the day of who ever was to find it. But instead I feel ripped off. F$%#ing disgusting, the health department needs to go in here and shut them down. What a disgrace to Italian food. They have a lot of groceries that look interesting but this place is so dirty and cluttered that I don't think they have sold anything off these shelves since opening day 40 years ago.
