It's fun to look around and figure out which jerkys you want to try (and those you need to give away as omiyage).\n\nMy favorite beef jerky was the Country Butcher Beef Briskey Jerkey.  It comes in four flavors - original, teriyaki, sweet spicy, and spicy.  What I like about this brand is that the jerky is super flavor and SOFT!  Gone are the days where you break a tooth on beef jerky.\n\nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/the-beef-jerky-store-las-vegas?userid=jI5grCzPrcpYgqtNVygWRQ#0VJTAxdeVjn5_MFXa2Eb6w\n\nIt's like a rotating door here - TONS of people, and the lines to check out can get pretty long.  The proprietor looked like she was from Hawaii and offered a complimentary smile while I was checking out.  That's ok, the beef jerky is delicious!\n\nThey provide shipping on in-store or phoned-in orders.\n\nProduct Grade:  A+ (For the massive selection)\nService Grade:  B\nWorth the money grade:  B+\nOverall Impression Grade:  B+
