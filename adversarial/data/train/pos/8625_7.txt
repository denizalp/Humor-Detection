This bar is very swanky and NYC in style, it really made me miss home. It has a pretty small interior bar area that never got too crowded on a Friday night and what looked like a spacious outdoor patio area.\n\nThe service wasn't the best and the drink I chose wasnt the best either but I'm willing to overlook these problems given how much I enjoyed just being there. \n\nI have one gripe. What is with the stupid TV playing ESPN? It pretty much guarantees any man with even just a fleeting interest in sports is going to stare straight at the stupid tv and not at me. It took a long time to get my hair and makeup to look this way and I would rather he look at me and not at the game taped earlier in the damn day. \n\nBars, especially high end martini bars like this need to be bold and leave the TVs out of the equation. End rant.\n\nI would definitely come back.
