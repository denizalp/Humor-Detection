Nice spot to add a coffee option to the area, props for utilizing the drive-thru which likely gets them more business. Interior is on the plain side and the bakery case is limited. My skinny vanilla latte was okay. Nothing in particular stood out here and though the location is quiet, it's still so new and bare that it didn't quite feel like a spot to linger and get some work done. Hopefully they will add some umbrellas so that the patio seating can be utilized.
