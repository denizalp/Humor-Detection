I am a fan...and because of that, I stop pretty frequently...I'd say more than 50% of the time that I motor north into the Great Shining Beacon on the side of McDowell Mt. and Pinnacle Peak called \"North Scottsdale\", I stop off for cup or a cone!\n\nThe ice cream is made with love and craftsmanship that surpasses that of most of the restaurants in the Greater Phoenix area...I really do love their Madagascar Vanilla Bean ice cream!\n\nWonderful, delightful sweet treats...just about the best ice cream that I've ever had (and that includes the homemade frozen custard that I used to make...and I will tell you that nobody appreciates my own cooking more than I do!).\n\nSo, Donald, why only 4 stars for the Republic?\n\nIs it just me?\n\nAm I xenophobic?...have something against ice cream based governmental systems?...maybe a lactose intolerance based grudge against the Republic and those for which it stands?\n\nNo...no...I just want a smile out of somebody when I buy a cup or a cone and then maybe spend another $20-30 to take a little frozen delight home to the Beautiful Carin...I've been in this place 20 times or more and I never get more than a \"next\" out of the people dishing out the scoops!\n\nOr a hurried \"will that be all?\" when they are ready for me to be done and pay and get going...\n\nI try to chat...even stuff like \"how's your day?\" and \"boy, that looks great!\" is met with silence.\n\nMaybe it's just me...\n\nLast week, I dropped by on my way home from a visit with one of my attorneys (and you can believe me when I say I really needed a treat).\n\nIt wasn't a busy afternoon...but again...I was greeted with...indifference.\n\nThere was a sign in the window advertising for help...wanting people \"passionate\" about being there...OK, I see the passion in the ice cream...and the customer service isn't bad...not really...they always get to me eventually and I get what I want...but I couldn't say that anyone behind the counter has ever smiled at me...chatted with me...even when taking my money...sometimes quite a bit of money...it's a little bit disconcerting...\n\nOh well, the ice cream here is the star of the show and I do like the ice cream!\n\nOh, and a smile and chat would be nice, too!
