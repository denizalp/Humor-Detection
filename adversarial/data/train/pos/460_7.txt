The food is great and can actually make you full for the price. We went around 9:00PM and its like a chill\/hip hop playing music type of place. If you like some quiet type of restaurant well this is not for you. \n \nI just wish we weren't sitting next to some \"couple\" that looks like they just met  because they were making out the whole time. Like why not go to some other places like a hotel instead of a restaurant lol\n\nAnyways....\n\nOut of all the things we ordered I loved the foi gras, wild mushrooms and the steak the most!!! The fries is also great!!! The foie gras is cooked to perfection and so is the steak!! The beed carpaccio is usually my favorite but not from this place. \n\nThe customer service was also great!!! I wish I remember the lady's name but she was really nice and helpful.
