Since Tenaya Creek Brewery doesn't serve food, we ordered delivery from Northside Nathan's, which is nearby.  After browsing the menu, we decided to get a Large 1\/2 Guys & Dolls (Sausage, Pepperoni, Onions) & Veggetarian (Onions, Peppers, Mushrooms, Tomatoes, Olives).....$24.  They told us 45 min to 1 hour.....not bad during the Super Bowl.\n\nThe food didn't seem to take long to deliver.....we anxiously tore open the box and started to dive into it....it was very very good!  The crust is thick like Sicilian style Pizza and is fluffy and full of flavor.  The Pizza is square-cut and holds the toppings well on the crust.  It hit the spot!\n\nEasily one of my favorite Pizza & Sandwich joints in town.\n\nReturn Factor - 100%
