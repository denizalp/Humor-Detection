We tried 4 different things, all the tacos, corn soup, pork bellies-didn't care for these, seemed like raw bacon. We thought everything else was decent but small portions. We used a coupon at www.localdines.com to get 40 for $20.  I had indigestion afterward--acid relux, something odd in that soup. Seemed to take a long time to get food. We wouldn't go back. 3 stars for 50% off and 2 stars at normal prices. The music was blaring from 4-5. We asked the DJ to turn it down and she pretended to but there was no difference.
