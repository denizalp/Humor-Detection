Despite the naysaying of Urban Outfitters in general, I am a huge fan and use the store's website to get outfit ideas and make a general shopping list for myself. I browse things on the site, make a note in my phone or in a list of some sort (go figure, I love lists - who knew??) and then head to the store to track down the items I want. I just can't be bothered with the conventional method of picking through too many racks - I get bored fairly quickly and the organization of this location leaves something to be desired at most times (ie stuff on bottom shelves that's not displayed anywhere else in the store, shirts in cubbyholes or forgotten hooks and piles, etc). So it's just easier to describe\/point and ask.\n\nYes, most things are overpriced but you don't have to buy EVERYTHING in your wardrobe at UO. I tend to buy unique pieces and jewellery only, and stick to cheaper stores for classic staples or fleeting trends. Some of the jewellery and accessories they have are stunning - really unique pieces\nthat you won't find anywhere else and they're usually nicely showcased on mannequins throughout the store. \n\nThe only downside to this location is that there are never enough cashes open and the lines are pretty long so I would recommend dragging someone (a work husband or otherwise platonic male friend will do) to the store with you and tasking them with waiting in line while you browse and gather all of your stuff. By the time you're ready to pay they MIGHT have neared the front of the line.
