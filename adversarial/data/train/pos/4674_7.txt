I came to Casey Moores with a mission. I was gonna drink beer. But what I got from this establishment was so much more. I was exposed to some kind of eclectic hipster meet. Hip neophytes that finally decided on a style or a lack thereof, that has settled on some kind of facial hair construction and to back that up with a shirt that clearly was suppose to be ironic, but which message totally was well over my head. My focus was beer to dull the senses. \n\nBut enough about those on whom the old Jedi mind tricks work, the service was OK. The rest of the people here was interesting, if I do come back here it probably will be for the people. I didn't eat, but I have heard that they have great seafood. Maybe I will try that the next time.
