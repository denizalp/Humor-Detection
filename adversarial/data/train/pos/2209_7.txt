I wanted to check this place out because I noticed they had poke on the menu! I was very excited and curious of what a restaurant named \"bowlology\" could offer. Upon entering the store it appeared to be a spacious and modern looking setting. There were juices to our left to chose from. We didn't get greeted right away, it took about 15 minutes to get greeted and noticed. I ordered an OG Poke bowl - tuna, edamame, seaweed salad, and soy sauce. You get to chose brown rice, white rice, or a salad with that, I chose white rice. Also, I ordered the \"I love Acai\" smoothie. My fianc√® ordered a Spicy Shoyu bowl with a Chocolate lovers smoothie. Two poke bowls and two smoothie items were $31 with tax. I initially thought that it was very pricey but I thought they'd make up for it from their portioning\/ taste... sadly, they did not. The poke bowl was very small, I killed that bowl within 3 minutes and the one size smoothie is like a \"small\" cup size. We were done with our smoothie and food within 5-10 minutes of receiving it. \n\nOur wait time for our food was 25 minutes. It wasn't that busy and by looking at the size of our bowls I don't think it takes that long. I asked for a side of extra sauce on the side and heard one of the employee's sigh... that discouraged me from ever coming back to the counter to ask for anything else. I think this is my first and last time visiting just because I felt like a burden from that guy who sighed from getting me extra sauce. There weren't any customers in line or waiting so it didn't make sense to express an annoyance towards me?! They have a water dispenser towards the back of their store and there's a lot of seating spaces. Tables aren't wiped down as often so you'd most likely have to. Is your table. I'd probably be back if portions get bigger and that guy's customer service improves. As a first time customer I wasn't left with an impression to want to come back or recommend my local friends to get poke from here.
