Our burger father who are in heaven (or Etobicoke?)\nShallow fry our onion rings\nThy fries will be well done\nOur burgers on a bun\nThy number will be rung (when your order's ready)\n\n****\n\nIt seems the burger priest is as divisive as any real religion. Believers are fundamentalists and disciples  from the church of Licks that was located next door seek redemption from what they are hoping to be a religious burger experience. \n\nFirstly, I love a 'new thing' as much as the next overweight, food obsessed citizen of Toronto but I have to say after coming to this burger church 3 times and consuming most of their menu I simply don't get the hype. The burgers are so greasy I can actually feel my heart gasp as every clump of beef slides down my gullet. I can see how some could mistake grease for juice - but boys and girls - this is grease. We know this due to the film that covers your hands as you pick up the burger. Additionally, the burger itself has no seasoning or any ostensible flavor other than beef which I get some would like but their sauces do not add enough flavor to compensate. It just is kinda bland (and greasy, (just in case you missed that))\n\nI think the meatiness flavour sans salt\/seasoning could work if there was some golden searing of the meat to develop flavour. The meat is grey and that is exactly how it tastes. The greasiness and the blandness are connected, the meat doesn't get seared (i.e. not cooked at a high enough tempreture) and so the fat oozes from the burger before it should. \n\nThe bread doesn't hold this level of grease well and gets soggy very quickly so don't even think about takeout be user by the time this baby gets past 2 minutes you have a soggy mush. I feel they would be better off putting this cholesterol heart attack inducing patty on a baguette as at least it would soak up the excess fat \n\nI've eaten a 'high priest' which is their version of a Big Mac (way too much bread) and had a side of chile cheese fries (just average). There regular burger is fine but has all the same issues highlighted above. \n\nThe place is clean, ingredients seem super fresh and it feels hip and happening over lunch so like many religions there is a lot of glitz but perhaps not that much substance. \n\nSure it's better than McDonalds but is it the second coming of the hamburger or the resurrection of French fries? The answer, I'm sorry to say is 'no'. I will have to seek burger redemption elsewhere :(\n\nAmen.
