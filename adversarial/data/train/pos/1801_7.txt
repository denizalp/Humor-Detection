Well for starters we've never chose to dine in and drink their heavily advertised $5 beers... Is that supposed to be a deal on the east side of Lakewood? What we have done was get carry out 3 times. 1st time was very meh. Pretty flavorless, pretty big, with a smorgasbord of underwhelming sauces. 2nd time was a drunken decision, so you almost have to cancel that experience. But the 3rd was a \"hey, remember that taco place? did we like it or not? I forget, let's try again. I arrive to pick it up only to arrive to a girl that looks like she hates anyone who isnt one of their 15 regulars. the bill came out to $24 and I had $30 and just told her to keep it. No thank you, no smile, no anything.... I didn't know $6 wasn't enough to be a bitch. So yet another good reason to not waste your time by sitting with these pleasant people. \nAll I have to say is DON'T GET THE STEAK TACO! The meat was like dog food. No joke, it looked like rubber and tasted like Grandfather's foot. \nJust dont go here. Get it out of Lakewood. It's just another pot hole on Madison Ave.
