Update. This is my favorite ice cream shop in the country. I've been around the block too. Having traveled all up and down the east coast, and having lived in Vegas and LA, I've seen my share of frozen yogurt, ice cream, gelato and whatnot.\n\nI came in the other night and, once again, nothing short of spectacular. \n\nBacon ice cream is on the weekends! \n\nI also happened to write a blog post because of my enthusiasm for Sweet Republic. SR even tweeted me back! Normally, I'd think nothing of it, because businesses tend to write me back on many different platforms, but this one stuck out in particular because I didn't tag them. \n\nClearly, they did a search for key terms, found me, and decided to write back and keep in touch.\n\nThis is business at it's best.\n\nFor you mobile users, here is my original review:\n\nYour first Beatles song. Your first kiss. Your first....\n\nAll are seminal moments in life. Yelperazzi, today....I had a seminal moment. I went to Sweet Republic, and nearly Ice Creamed my pants.\n\nThe Mavs were on their way to winning the championship, while LeBron left his talents on ESPN.\n\nSR had no line, since it was a quiet Sunday night. I was promptly greeted by a friendly scooper, and ordered Salted Butter Carmel in a cup...to go.\n\nThe scooper politely asked me if I would like it packed in ice. WHAT? ICE? FOR ME? It was like a gift sent upon me by the ice cream Gods. F*** Me, I'm Famous! Or at least I felt like it.\n\nAs I got home and unpacked my frozen treaty mctreat, I discovered a heavenly cup of deliciousness. \n\nThis really is the best ice cream...I have ever had. Little ribbons of caramel. Spikes of sea salt. Sweet creamy goodness. Thank God I worked out today.\n\nI am coming back, because there are so many obscure flavors that piqued my interest...like Avocado Jalapeno and Honey Blue Cheese.\n\nMy life has been changed. \n\nI will end this review with the pledge of allegiance. \n\n\"I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the sweet republic for which it has, one scoop in a cup, indivisible, with flavors and spoons for all.\"\n\nGod Bless America. Eff Yeah!.
