When I first moved here I bought a foot massage for my stepdaughter. I ended up getting her something else so I took the certificate to get a foot massage. I am so glad that I did not send my stepdaughter as I quickly realized that this place isn't what is advertised. I was placed on a normal chair in a massage room with a bucket of warm water at my feet. A male customer came in after me and I was told to sit and wait until he was done with his massage. As the masseuse and the male patron walked past my room  the male patron winked at me. I was like...ahm...ok? As I sat in the room I noticed a bottle of baby oil and full length mirror placed sideways on the wall near the massage table. I was like \"why would I want to watch my massage?\" It started to slowly dawn on me...I stared at my bucket of Lukewarm water and started to imagine the cops busting to do a raid. Would they think I was a \"masseuse\"?!?! No, just an naive woman staring at a bucket of water in horror. I grabbed my shoes and ran out barefoot. I am SO glad I didn't sent my stepdaughter there.
