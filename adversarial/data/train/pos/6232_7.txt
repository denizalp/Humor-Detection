BEWARE!!!!  I have tried this place a few times thinking that maybe the employee was new or maybe I hadn't communicated my expectations clearly however today was awful!  My Old English Bulldog went in for a bath, clean up, nail trim (bronze package) He got a great bath and smells good however his nails are rough ( they were suppose to grind them and didn't) and his ears didn't get touched.  My second dog is a schnau-tzu who weighs in around 5 pounds.  I asked for his hair to stay long (teddy bear) style however he got chopped (REALLY BUTCHED) The stylist Darci told me that they only trim the body with electric clippers.  I found this concerning as this has never been the case with any groomer before.  I just paid 49.00 dollars for my dog to be fully groomed not to have a clippers raced around his body.  The attached picture show what they did to my dog and the bottom left is how he normally looks.  This place is Horrible...
