I was in need of a key to be copied and Lowe's was unable to make one because they didn't have the key on file. You see, this copy would be of a padlock key and apparently that calls for a specialty key shop. Thankfully, Bob at Lowe's recommended ABC. \n\nI drove straight over to discover wood covering the windows and a folding table out front with two ABC guys. Apparently Capriottis has a fire which caused damage to the entire complex. Kudos for still being open and making key magic happen. \n\nThe men were super helpful in trying to find a key but we didn't have any luck and I had to walk away copyless.The problem isn't their stock of keys. They almost have everything. The problem is that the specific padlock I have isn't American made which means that spare keys are harder to come by. \n\nI learned so much about keys while standing outside and left knowing that if I brought the actual lock back they could likely make a copy. They didn't have to be so helpful, especially when they didn't have what I needed and they had literally almost burnt down, but they were. Love that.
