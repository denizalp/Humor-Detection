I need more stars! I love Bean! No...really. I LOVE BEAN!! As a vegan,  this place is my second home. The culinary creativity is amazing! Flavor of the food is ORGASMIC! I ain't lying! I make loud noises when I eat.  More, if not most, importantly...the people who we work here are some of the friendliest people in Charlotte and you can tell they live what they're doing.\nMY FAV'S...\n\nWeekend Brunch- Carrot Bacon changed my life and most recently, they had Tofu Benedict. Dayum!! It was good. \n\nBacon Cheeseburger\nJackfruit BBQ\nSides...macaroni and cheese, fried squash and collard greens\nDesserts-If I'm ever in a coma...someone get me 2 slices of raspberry zinger cake and 6 cowboy  cookies. Oh lawd!\n\nThey also serve local craft beers. Sweet! Most recently, they opened a grocery section selling all sorts of vegan deliciousness.  If you're  looking for vegan marshmallows...this is the place to get them.\n\nI LOVE BEAN! \n\nThe end.
