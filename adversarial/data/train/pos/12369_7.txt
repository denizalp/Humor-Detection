I am a regular at Press. They really should know my name, but they don't. Bitter, party of one. Well the old manager did, but she left for Soul. Alas. I eat lunch there on a regular basis to enjoy their hummus & tabbouleh wrap (fresh and delish!), the turkey and brie with fig marmalade panini or the mozzarella with sundried tomato and basil sandwich. C'est tres bon. Soups are usually good, though sometimes garlicky. Their make your own salads are OK. Their accompaniments of crackers and candy are sometimes indulgences (but skip the awful Snickerdoodles).  \n\nFor dinner, some of their sushi is great, some needs some more vivre but is still good (press roll is amazing, apple jack is interesting, wasabi trio should be more zesty) . Their other dishes are crowd pleasers, but this is typically not a place to go after running 15 miles and you're starving. Their plates are small and well designed. Their fondue (cheese or chocolate) is fun and great for a girls' night out to pair with a nice bottle of wine at grocery prices. Tuesdays are $5 wines by the glass. They also have a game night and trivia night. It's a great neighborhood hang out. Chairs could be more comfortable, but it's fine and love the outdoor seating when the weather is nice. \n\nMy #1 complaint? Seriously you have GOT to fix the ventilation (especially at lunch). I avoid going there if I have afternoon meetings because I come back to the office stinking of grease. Blech. It's not as bad at dinner because they're not running the panini press, but seriously, it's a nice place so get an extra vent in there, Pierre. Merci.
