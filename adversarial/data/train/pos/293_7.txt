Oh how I loved this place.  We came here the first night we were at this hotel and casino.  Came in for an early dinner and boy was it good.  I enjoyed the chow fun and the kalbi. Everything tasted good to me. The service was good and they're very attentive.\nShrimp chips were nice and crispy.  Will be back to try different things.
