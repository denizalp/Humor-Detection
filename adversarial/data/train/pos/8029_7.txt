There's a freakin weird flying beetle in my room and I called the front desk several times to have someone remove it or give me a vacuum to do it. Unfortunately it's past midnight, the maintenance person is also the shuttle driver so after I was told if have to wait 20 mins while it is flying and creeping around-I call and find out person isn't retuning anytime soon Bc another airport pick up. No one else working downstairs so they can't come over and drop off a vacuum hose. My shuttle to the airport is at 6 am and I've travelled hours today. I don't know how much longer I will have to stay awake and try to track the weird insect from afar.\nIt is now 1239 am and I'm still waiting\/can't sleep....\n1243 am maintenance finally came back but knocks even though I've expressively told the front desk to have her come in Bc I do not want to walk by it. Front desk claims she has no way to communicate with her (hello radio walkie talkie) and that she's not allowed to. BS I'm a seasoned business traveller and know they have communication and have had staff come in while I'm in and while I'm not in the room. Sure enough I had to make a quick dash to the door and there she was with the walkie talkie and said that the front desk didn't tell her.\n\nAvoid this hotel since it isn't clean, they didn't offer to move me, took an hour to try to resolve it and then lie about communication. Really?!?! I stay at various brands of hotels and at major and minor locations. I'm really upset about this!!!!
