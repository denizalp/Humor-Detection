One of the best new little spots in Vegas and a very welcome addition to the west side.  Very flavorful food and very reasonably priced.  Everything is freshly made and very tasty. \n\nTo the woman who wrote (below) that there should be more \"normal\" food on the menu: you've got to be kidding.  There's a plethora of dumbed-down Americanized \"Asian\" food in Vegas and I'd suggest you go there.  As to your complaint about the nuts in the chicken - it's written in 3-inch letters on the wall menu! \n\nI'll be back soon - and frequently.
