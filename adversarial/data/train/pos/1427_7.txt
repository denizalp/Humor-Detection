I have 5 years in the taxi business as a taxi driver, and was looking for work, and went to apply at this company. I was told the owner doesn't like men with long hair, so either cut it or GTFO of here. I used to use this company for my personal needs when I needed a cab, but now since I am not good enough to work for them, I will never call another A Cab again... Got hired the next day at a different company who clearly needed veteran drivers more than A Cab.
