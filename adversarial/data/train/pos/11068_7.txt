Ohhhh when it comes to Pakistani \/ Indian cuisine in the Valley, Z-Grill has my heart and taste buds.  For those of you who don't do dive-y joints quit reading now and move on.  For those more adventurous you will be pleased.  \n\nLocated inside Zam-Zam World Market on 40th St, North of McDowell, you can blink and miss it.  Wander in to the back past the butcher and you order at the window.  They may not have everything listed on the menu so you may have to ask or reorder. It is a small but flavorful selection, they don't skimp on the seasoning or the spice here.  Thus making it an even more euphoric experience.  I stick with the Naan and the poori for your side options...the last time i tried the rice it tasted like it was steamed in the burlap sack....unless you mixed it with the curry...But this was not enough to deter me from going back every 4 days for about a month...\n\nWhich reminds me I need to get back there soon!
