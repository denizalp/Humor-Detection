I have been going to this place for the past 4 months and I LOVE IT! I usually get acrylic nails (aka fake nails) and in other places they place it on the tip of the nails which makes the fake part flimsy and fragile however here they do it the best! They place the acrylic on the majority of your real nail and cuts it to your desire length and by doing it this way, it insures that the acrylic part is strong and stable. You also don't have to get that painful remover of the false nails because every time you go they just cut it shorter and you will soon end up with just your natural nail which I LOVE-other places just swipe them off with a cuticle tool which damages your nails. The color selection for gel and regular is very good. The areas and the atmosphere is very modern and clean-which is what I look for in a nail salon. Great location, great people, great price, great atmosphere-5 star worthy.
