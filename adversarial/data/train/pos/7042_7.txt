Legends is always a fantastic show, no matter who is starring that night!  Tonight we started off with the new act - Bob Marley! I forgot how much I love Bob Marley, I had the Legend CD in college - every song was terrific! I just wish I was \"smoking two joints\" to truly have an authentic experience. Then we had Johnny Cash, and he not only looked just like him but also sang perfectly. Michael Jackson, always a great time and a really good dancer especially. Followed by a fairly new act John Bon Jovi who also sang a bunch of hits. But the real star of the evening was Tina Turner - she was incredible!  Tons of energy, great dancing, vocals were perfect!!  \n\nThe back up dancers and singers did a very professional job and kept us entertained between acts. It was fun to see how fast they could do their costume changes.  The black spiraling mirrored boxes on stage looked a little low tech and like some high school musical stagehands put them together. (not THE High School Musical, but a non-famous, public school, type of high school musical) We also had the Total Rewards deal of BOGO tickets which made the evening extra sweet.
