You \"should\" eat at this spot if you like to listen to and be surrounded by a bunch of trashy, tacky, rude and disgusting employees.  This place will not last.  I've told everyone I know about what a horrible experience my mother and I had when just trying to order a falafel sandwich.  No other customers, 2 employees, and you would have thought we asked to have their first born.  They were openly yelling at each other, shoving food in their mouths, complaining about being \"so busy\" etc...  We were so uncomfortable by the way they interacted with each other, we told them to forget our order and we were out.  As we started to walk out, they began attempting to start a confrontation with my mother and I.  I laughed it off because I have some self-respect, etc...    Had they caught me in a bad mood, I may have slapped the taste out of their mouths.  If you're looking for Jerry Springer type ambiance for your meal, THIS IS YOUR SPOT!
