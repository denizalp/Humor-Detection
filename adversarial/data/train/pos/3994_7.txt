AYCE KBBQ open 24hrs!!!!\n\nUnlike many of the strip restaurants which are jam packed during dinner hours, Ginseng was almost empty.  It was prefect for my hungry group, no reservations, and we were seated promptly after arrival.  \n\nThe all you can eat menu is very limited to just 6 items.  For what it lacks in options, it picks up in quality, for parts of the menu that is.\n\n\n - Bulgogi - The best meat in my opinion.  Loaded with green and white onions, it made for the best tasting meat option.\n\n - Brisket - pretty average, not much to say anything about.\n\n - Spicy pork - again, average option, not much going with the meat or marinate.\n\n - LA Galbi - the bone-in short ribs were pretty legit, close second to the bulgogi.\n\n - Pork belly - overly fatty.  More fat than meat, on the disappointing end.\n\n - Marinated Chicken - I usually steer clear of chicken at KBBQ because of the longer cooking time.  The chicken and marinate we're definitely above my expectations.\n\n\nI'm pretty spoiled by the dime a dozen KBBQ spot's in LA with great quality, so my review might be a bit biased.  Overall, the food is decent, if you're looking to fill yourself to the brim full meat, I'd say this is the place for you.  It is on the expensive side, the time I went it was $23 per person, now it's $29 per person.
