Pretty decent middle eastern fare. The shelves were mostly empty when I went there, but they had some take home items available like tahini, fozen pita and baba ganoush. Your choice of wraps or plates; fresh ingredients tasty and authentic. Big minus is the locale.\n\n\nThere was, of course, the usual loud arabic banter going on between staff (typical of the culture, bound to freak out the local southern belles)\n\nheh heh.
