Frequently overheard at Bier Markt:\n\n\"I think we're out of that one.\"\n\n\"Oooh, we just ran out.\"\n\n\"I don't think we've had that one for a while.\"\n\nThe beer menu here is really just for show. Not sure how Bier Markt gets away with it -- imagine going to a restaurant which doesn't actually serve 2\/3rds of what is on the menu!
