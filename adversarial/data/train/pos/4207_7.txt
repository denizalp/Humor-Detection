The.best.breakfast.in.town.\n\nThanks bye.\n\nOkay to elaborate a bit - no matter what you order here for breakfast, it's going to be awesome.  And don't look for menu's - the eats are up on the wall, silly.  And it doesn't matter what time of day it is, order a milkshake.  I guarantee you ten dollars it'll be the best one you've ever had (the kind that they serve to you still in the freezing cold tin cup with a big long spoon).\n\n*Tip:  if you are smart you will PLAN to go to Mickie's and you will be there early, and not on a football weekend.  Otherwise you will be standing in line, most likely outside in the cold, for a long, long time.  Take it from me.  -30 degrees on a rumbling, empty stomach in January isn't really that much fun.
