We got there at 4pm and it was very quiet.  There just a handful of patrons.  The outdoor patio was empty.  We were meeting a friend for \"Happy Hour\".  One draft beer, one diamond cocktail  (pineapple based) and one margarita later we were ready to order a second round and some appetizers. JR ordered the beef sliders with parmesan garlic fries, Ron got chicken tenders buffalo style with the parm\/garlic fries and l got the shrimp appetizer.  The boys liked their food. JR thought the beef sliders were over-done, thus dry. Ron enjoyed his chicken tenders.  Chicken tenders are made ready to please most guests as it wasn't spicy  (Rom prefers spicier flavors). My shrimp was not my fav because it was smothered in warm thousand island mayo.  By 5:300ish, the house was packed, patio filled up, it is definitely a popular joint!  I give very high marks to the waitresses who attended to our table, they are outstanding, personable and we couldn't have asked for better service!  Food is in my view very average 2.5 to 3.0.  Beverages were very tasty.  Atmosphere is very inviting, comfortable, a very nice hang out at the end of the day, say... Friday, TGIF!  I can't review their dinner menu at this point but l hope it is better than their happy hour menu.
