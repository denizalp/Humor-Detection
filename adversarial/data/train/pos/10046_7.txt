I'll admit that their \"Not Yo Mama's Grilled Cheese\" caught my eye when browsing pictures. However, I'm a firm believer that a grilled cheese consists of bread, butter (or mayonnaise), and cheese. Anything else added to that and it becomes a melt.\n\nWant tuna on a grilled cheese? If that's your thing, by all means you are entitled to do that. However, you don't make a grilled cheese with tuna. You make a tuna melt. Want bacon on a cheeseburger? Ok, but it's not a cheeseburger anymore, but a bacon cheeseburger. The same idea applies here. Once they add brisket, kale, tomato, etc., it's no longer grilled cheese. Seriously, they had a chance to use alliteration in their naming process and could've called it \"Not Yo Mama's Melt\" - an infinitely better name for this sandwich.\n\nWell, the staff got on the offensive when I pointed this out to them. They cited that there's a grilled cheese truck that adds additional ingredients as well. I promptly told them they were wrong about that, too. Also, I don't recognize grilled cheese trucks as the authority on this subject.\n\nhttps:\/\/www.quora.com\/Whats-the-difference-between-a-grilled-cheese-and-a-melt\n\nhttps:\/\/thecookful.com\/what-is-grilled-cheese-sandwich\/\n\nhttps:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Cheese_sandwich#Grilled_cheese_sandwich\n\nhttps:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Melt_sandwich\n\nAs for the sandwich itself, I felt it was slightly overpriced and not worth a second go. I actually enjoyed the fresh greens more. There was a sweetness coming through that I didn't enjoy. It may have been from the bacon jam.\n\nThey also forgot my fries (ordered through Yelp), but they didn't charge me for them either.
