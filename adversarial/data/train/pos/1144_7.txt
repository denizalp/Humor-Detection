Absolutely horrible. Set an appointment online yesterday for 6:30pm today. Spoke with salesman at noon today confirming the appointment. Drove from Alliante and arrived promptly at 6:15 to sharks swarming me literally yelling \"bro\" from across the parking lot. \n\nI then find that my assigned salesman whom I spoke to earlier in the day was nowhere to be found and that the vehicle I looked to drive was \"in the shop\" getting its inspection. Won't be available until \"tomorrow, or maybe Wednesday, but certainly Thursday.\"\n\nNo thanks.
