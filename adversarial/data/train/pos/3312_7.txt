I had a bad experience with the groomers. \n\nI get so frustrated when staff in the business of infirmation are utterly UNinformative. \"I don't know\" is not an acceptable reply in customer service. \n\nI booked an appointment weeks in advance because I needed my cat out of the apartment that morning. I went out of my way for this location, and when I arrived they said they could not accept my cat without an updated rabies shot. Perhaps the staff member who took my appointment should have informed me about this when I booked it, for I certainly would have made sure to get my (indoor) cat updated before wasting my time bringing her all the way uptown only to be turned away. What's more, I was now stuck with my poor cat on a day that was already booked solid and stressful. Also, the employee working that day was completely unhelpful, offered no solutions (perhaps there was a nearby vet?) and even said, \"I don't know what you want right now, so...\"\n\nTime to find a new groomer.
