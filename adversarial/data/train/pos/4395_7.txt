After seeing all the tips and pics of the Spicy Korean Chicken, I was more than intrigued to come here. So when I jus happened to be in the area, there was no doubt what I was gonna have for lunch.\n\nCame here at 11:30 and there was a little line forming already. Ordered my Spicy Korean Chicken with Mushrooms and onions. Threw some sriracha on there (which was on every table) and enjoyed how crispy the chicken was. The onions and mushrooms were the cherry on top. All of this was sittin on top of steamed white rice. I love the teriyaki sauce they put on top. It was just the right amount to bring all the flavors together like a very good orchestral symphony. \n\nService was surprisingly fast based off of the customers that ordered before me. Im actually glad I got in at the time I did because around 12, the place got packed quick! That's always a good sign of a good establishment.\n\nPrices are really good for the portions that you get. What I got was supposedly one of the bowl options. Seemed more like a stretched out oblong plate. Mind you they have actual plate combos that give you even more food.\n\nSince all I had was the chicken, I know I have way more reasons to come back here to try out the other great items. 4 solid stars.
