I really wouldn't recommend this place to anyone. Their customer service wasn't good, they had a very horrible language barrier. Food was flavorless, I was very disappointed given the reviews I have read.\nThe salsa station was empty, then we told them that they couldn't even understand us.\nI was disappointed, we will never go back.
