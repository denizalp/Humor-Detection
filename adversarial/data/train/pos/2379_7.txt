Life is short, so get the brownie toffee sundae!  http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/grassroots-kitchen-and-tap-scottsdale?select=V9TKyeFqNebqzWerd387Ig#V9TKyeFqNebqzWerd387Ig\n\nMy friend and I decided to have dinner after work and decided to finally check out this bookmark of mine.  Sat at the bar as the restaurant was already quite busy at 7 pm.  It was noisy inside (I don't think there's patio seating), but it wasn't so noisy that it interfered.  We both enjoyed the atmosphere- hip, romantic, and great energy.  He was happy to find an old Oregon beer favorite that he hasn't seen in other local places and ordered one.  I tried and liked it, so I ordered one as well.  (A Deschutes Black Butte porter, I think.)  Service was friendly, but very slow.  So slow, that after 20 minutes of trying to get our bartender-server's eye contact, we followed the couple's lead next to us who sat AFTER we did and said \"Hey, yeah, we'd like to order.\"  \n\nWe shared the pork chop entree that came with candied pancetta and Swiss chard- perfectly balanced sweet and saltiness of the candied bacon, and the chard wasn't bitter. http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/grassroots-kitchen-and-tap-scottsdale?select=eNr6AIXkws3DTvU5_EhJ_Q#eNr6AIXkws3DTvU5_EhJ_Q  He was surprised to find he enjoyed the vegetable (I think it was his first time trying it).  $22 was a bit pricey, I thought, but the chop was juicy and tender.  I wasn't impressed with the $4, or maybe $6 side of jumbo asparagus, which he didn't try. http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/grassroots-kitchen-and-tap-scottsdale?select=VI2Gv6vqjvl4RhlcplEyUw#VI2Gv6vqjvl4RhlcplEyUw  It didn't look appetizing, and the spears weren't as buttery as I had hoped they would be, but at least they were both tender and crunchy as they should be.  The brownie toffee sundae was terrific! http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/grassroots-kitchen-and-tap-scottsdale?select=okJuXVOR2W9GfcjGei42cA#okJuXVOR2W9GfcjGei42cA  Made with Ghirardelli chocolate chips, and I think the caramel sauce was house made, but I could be mistaken.  The sweet dish did not come with house made whip cream, but I requested it, and the server and kitchen obliged.  The dessert didn't need the extra cream, but now I know that should I want one with coffee, or another dessert, I may ask for it here.
