Yum!!\nI love Frasher's. I love that there has always been speculation amongst my friends as to how to pronounce it. (it's not rocket science people) I love that the place is often full of strippers (who doesn't like strippers) and I love love love the food. \n\nThey used to have this shrimp salad that was amazing. I haven't seen it on the menu for quite some time but every time I went I ordered this salad. This was back in my pseudo vegetarian days when the only meat I consumed was of the fish\/ shellfish variety. Now that I'm fully obsessed with suicide by red meat I opt for the Filet. The Toasted Ravioli and Stuffed Mushroom Caps are also a favorite, especially if I'm more there to get my buzz on than eat a full meal. \n\nAll in all I've had nothing but good experiences at Frasher's. Even if my meal didn't come with a lap dance... I can always just run across the street for that nonsense. \n\nP.S. Bring back the shrimp salad.
