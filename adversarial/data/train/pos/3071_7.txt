We recently had the guys from canadian choice come in to changes all the windows in our house. The Windows were over 20 years old and needed an upgrade.\n\nThe stuff was extremely professional from the estimator to the installers, they were very patient and very educational \n\nWe were shopping around for the right quality and price and canadian choice beat all other offers that we had received. \n\nWe had a small issue with one of the windows installed on the second floor but the service guys came the next day after we called it in and fixed the problem right away.\n\nThank You very much for such an amazing job we love our new windows and they make the house look so much better.\n\nHighly recommend
