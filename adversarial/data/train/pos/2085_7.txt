Pretty ballsy for anyone to take up McDonald's old space in the PV food court, let alone a family run Vietnamese joint! A lot of my friends back home would laugh if I said the best Viet food I had this week came from a 10 year old, his dad, and a white dude but I am far from joking.\n\nMy bro and I ordered separately, but I got grilled chicken over rice. That must have been two or three thighs or something because I got a box full of juicy, well seasoned meat over light rice. The salad that came with it felt more Americanized with the dressing but it still worked well. My bro ordered pho as always, and before he finished wiping out the bowl I tried the broth, which is pretty solid. Also super cool that you get actual restaurant style bowls in the court.\n\nWe did hit a little snafu - I ordered the spring rolls which seemed like they took forever. The lady at the adjacent table and I were talking about how adorbs the kid at the register was when she picked up her order of 6 - which came with a bonus since they ran out of shrimp. Strange, I came up to the bro working in the kitchen in asked him what's up. Man, that fallout between him and the little guy when they saw my order was incomplete was hilarious and totally worth it. But they DID hook me up with some more expensive slushie of any choice with boba. I got pina colada - which was a mighty fine drink.\n\nMaybe it's the lack of traffic\/help is from Thanksgiving weekend, because drinks and food did take a bit when they made everything fresh to order. However, my experience was more than satisfying and I am surely trying more of their menu next time I'm shopping around PV.
