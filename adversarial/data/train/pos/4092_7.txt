This place is Not Da Pineapple Express, called Touch of Aloha. Being  there, I just thought hmm lets try it out. Here's what i ordered:\n\n10.95 Kabli plate - The Kalbi came in a styrofoam box, all cut up into sections. With 2 scoops of rice. I've had a lot of Kalbi in my life, and I dont know how you can screw it up. This was a first... the Kalbi was toooooo sweet..wth?! Also, they were very thin pieces.\n\n10.95 2 Choice - small portions....\nMochiko Chicken - the chicken was not crispy at all. Using Mochiko is supposed to give an added texture and more crunch.\n\nKalua pork - This was the only thing that was decent, unless the too off putting sweetness from the Kalbi made me want to crave the salt.
