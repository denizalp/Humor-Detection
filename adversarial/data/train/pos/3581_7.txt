Stayed during CES because there really wasn't anything else available for a reasonable price. At $121 per night I feel I paid way more than the value received. \n\nMy coworker got the deluxe curry smelling room. Instantly on walking in the pungent smell of curry would hit your face like a brick wall. I fared much better with a pretty decent room no odors no noises and fairly clean. Most everything is very dated.
