I met some friends, Robyn N. and Rand H., here today to try their lunch buffet which is served during the week and on Sundays I believe.  It was a slow start to our culinary dinning experience at Pete's Thai Cuisine which started off as a 2 star experience waiting for them to open late and their kitchen was behind in getting everything out.  They slowly gained momentum as they brought out more food and our experience went from 2 stars to almost 5 stars! \n\nRestaurant~ please don't judge this place by the curb side appeal!  It's dinner dive that's connected to a auto shop on the southwest corner of Thunderbird and Cave Creek.  The inside is nicely decorated, very clean and inviting.  They have chosen a nice pallet of colors for the walls and they even have stenciled painting on the floors.  (glitter alert for those glitter fobes out there!) just kidding :^)  It's a nice experience inside this place.\n\nService~ very limited staff which is expected in a small dinner like this, but they are very friendly.  \n\nFood~ the soup was one of the items late to get out of the kitchen, but it was worth the wait! We had Coconut Soup with Chicken, coconut milk with fresh herbs, spices and mushrooms.  It was fantastic! Their Pad Thai was pretty good and seemed to be one of the favorites from other dinning at the same time as us.  It was put out and gone quickly!    Their Stir-Fried Big Fresh Rice Noodle with Chicken & Egg was something I've not had before.  They had both Red and Green curry dishes with  coconut milk, bamboo shoots, green beans, Thai eggplant,  Thai herbs with chicken and\/or tofu. They also had Spicy Muscles and Spicy Squid dishes as well.  Most everything tasted 4-5 stars!\n\nRecommendation~ go later than 11:30am, say 12-12:30pm to give them time to get everything out.  They are very good and very inexpensive at less than $8\/person, so bring some friends and have a very good and filling Thai lunch!  I hope to see you there.
