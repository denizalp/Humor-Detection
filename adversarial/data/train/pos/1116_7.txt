This place looks like a dump on the outside. My boyfriend asked me if it was an old strip club as we walked inside. He was serious.  They greeted us with \"two?\" And after we said yes, they again asked, \"for dinner?\" Well of course for dinner..After my boyfriend's first comment I started to second guess what else they might offer. \n\n  Literally the only cool thing about this place was the kitchen entry. However, upon entering we apologized because we thought we went through the wrong door. Apologizing for entering the restaurant. Weird. \n\n  It was our anniversary on a Sunday night. We were there, as well as two other tables. We didnt make it a point to tell the waitress of our occasion,  but she didnt ask either. We exchanged cards with eachother near the end of the evening. Our waitress seemed to not care as much about us, as she did the older folk that were seated next to us. \n\n  The steaks were decent. I have had better elsewhere for half of the cost. Please upgrade your cutlery. I have seen sharper knives at a dive bar. I got a workout while trying to cut my steak. Extremely frustrating and killed my mood. I was unimpressed with the Delmonico. Skip it..no flavor. Waitress did not come back to see if our steaks cooked properly (although the were to temperature.) \n\n  Ive read in some reviews that the decor is old school, mobster-like. Well I wish I had read that before I went, because I did not get that vibe at all. I got the vibe of a cheap, old place in desperate need of rennovation. \n\n  Extremely dissapointed in every aspect of this place. If I had known how to properly exit, I wouldve left before ordering. (Although I guess the kitchen was the main exit, just awkward not knowing as a first time guest)\n\n  This experience was so lousy, that we decided to do a \"re-date\" to celebrate our anniversary
