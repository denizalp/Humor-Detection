It is what it is, especially for $25 a night. i was totally spoiled, too, having spent the previous night at the Palazzo.\n\nThere is something depressing about this place, with the screaming children, the slot machines, the cigarette smoke, the folks on the sidewalk wearing t-shirts that advertise 'A GIRL TO YOUR ROOM IN 20 MINUTES' but I think that can be said for the entire \"Las Vegas Experience.\"\n\nAll that being said, my stay at Excalibur was decent -- I just wanted to get the hell out of Vegas.
