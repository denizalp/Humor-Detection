We decided to come here last minute for a quick weekend lunch yesterday finally! We were quickly seated by the hostess and greeted by our quirky, nice server. She gave us plenty of time to decide, everything looked good it was hard to choose. I ended up ordering the salmon patties with mac and cheese and the special hashbrown casserole of the day. The bf ordered the chicken and dumplings with a side of the infamous mashed potatoes. The food took forever to come out, my stomach was literally grumbling. But, when it did it was a lot of food. Not as piping hot as I would have liked though. The loved the consistency and size of the salmon patties, there was good seasoning in there as well but, I wish they used fresh salmon instead of canned. Would have made a huge difference. My sides were good, had to add some seasoning to the mac and cheese and the hashbrown casserole was delish. I did not like the deviled egg, it was very bland and hard to eat. \n\nMy bf really enjoyed his chicken and dumplings (not bad for 8 bucks) he however, and this is where I docked a star and a half, hated the mashed potatoes. It seems like someone smashed a potato crudely and placed it into the side cup. No seasoning or creamy component, and quite frankly it wasn't mashed with the proper smooth consistency one looks for in the traditional mashed potatoes. I had to play with it and had to add butter, salt, and pepper myself. Some cream would have been nice but, I didn't bother and just managed with what I had. Other than that, the biscuits were amazing...dirty little secret: I wanted to order more. I wasn't a fan of the white pepper gravy, I think I have been spoiled by the Flying Biscuit in this sense. \n\nThe dining room makes me want to kick back on the porch with some lemonade. Best part, our bill came out to under $20. For all that food, its worth the price. Will be back to try more.
