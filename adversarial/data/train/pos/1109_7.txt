Yes yes yes I'll go along with the 5-star bandwagon here!\nStellar coffee that makes me melt with satiation.\nThe staff is cool, the owner is a great guy willing to talk about anything, as long as it's coffee related and you are happily sipping one of his concoctions. There's always bumpin' music playing and a friendly 'hello' as you walk in this Fahrenheit. \nI put up with shit coffee all week at work and have no problem at all with that because I know I will be heading back home downtown to where the great coffee from places like this and Strange Love down the street.\nI've tried the 3 different beans available and they are all good smacking you in the tastebuds with flavour and cutting through the fog like a karate chop to your senses.\nI've tried the cappuccino, the flat white, and the latte, as well as grabbing a drip coffee to go (black of course) and they all taste fantastic!\nYou can likely drop by here while driving and stopping right in front which I have seen a few people do - grab and go, but sitting at the little chairs out front and enjoying the sleepy streetscape is worthwhile too.\nHighly recommended!
