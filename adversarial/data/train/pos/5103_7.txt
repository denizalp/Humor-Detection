ColdPress Express (Las Vegas \/ North Decatur & 215)\n\nColdPress Express is new and attached to SkinnyFats.  Keep in mind that their hours vary from SkinnyFats.  Check their hours before assuming they're open.  \n\nColdPress Express' motto is to stop juice abuse. They're referring to all the other places out there that simply overcharges for juices and smoothies with the same quality.  \n\nLists of Prices:\nJuices ($4.95 12oz. \/ $7.95 21oz.)\nShakes ($6.95 21oz.)\nSmoothies ($6.95 21oz.)\nPremium Blends ($8.95 21oz.)\nPremium Brews ($3.95 12oz.)\nShots ($2.95 4oz)\nCustom Drinks ($8.95oz.)\n\nI don't do juices because I'm allergic to fruits.  I also don't do smoothies because I rather eat my calories.  So, I really can't compare the prices\/quality of their juices and smoothies.  However, I can speak for their service and coffee.  Both are excellent.  My \"Go-To\" drink is their Major Ghee, which is their version of a \"Bulletproof Coffee\".  Some people even call it \"Keto Coffee\".  If you're not familiar with a \"Bulletproof Coffee, it's basically coffee with butter and Medium Chain Triglycerides or Coconut Oil.  ColdPress' version is a little different.  It's coffee, MCT, and a choice of Ghee butter or Coconut Oil.  Kind of backwards in my opinion.  But it works.  I will have mine with the Ghee and MCT.  It's really good and the least expensive version of \"Bulletproof Coffee\" that I've had in Vegas.  Cost is about $4.  I have also customized my own 21oz. drink for $8.95 (i.e. Do it your damn self).  That's always another option if I'm not in Major Ghee mood.\n\nOverall, I am more than a fan.  The service from everyone is top-notch. The Major Ghee is awesome!!\n\nCouple of tips regarding their Major Ghee:\n-It's an acquired taste.  I have fats and butter added to my coffee religiously for the last 4 years. It's a great source of instant and sustainable energy without the crash. Taste wise, it's like drinking a box of buttered popcorn.  Again, it's an acquired taste and I'm used to it. \n\n-MCT is great for digestion and all the calories come from fat.  Some MCT is good for you, too much can lead to stomach issues.  Know what you can tolerate per serving.  I recommend no more than 1 tablespoon per serving.  The same goes with the butter.  A teaspoon is perfect for me.  A tablespoon is a little overboard.
