I had to select one star, given the choice i would choose none.\n\nWe just went to see Dr. Van Lier Ribbink for a 1:00 surgical consultation for my husband.  at 1:40, the receptionist said, \"he is running a smidge late and is reviewing your file right now\".  After waiting another 40 minutes we were graced with his presence.  No, I apologize for being an hour and 40 minutes late, just \"so, what can i do for you today?\"  to which my husband replied with, I have.....\nhe then proceeded to examine my husband only to say, \"you do indeed have.... however I do not do those surgeries, i can go get the names of a couple of doctors that do\"\nWould you not know in reviewing the file, while running a smidge late, that you did not operate on this type of problem?  \nHe even took too damn long coming back with his reference, so we ended up just walking out.  Something we should have done at 1:15, not 2:50.\n\nHORRIBLE DOCTOR WITH AN EGO SO BIG THAT HE CANNOT DO WHAT IS PROFESSIONAL AND RIGHT FOR HIS PATIENTS.
