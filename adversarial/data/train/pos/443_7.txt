My vote is ok.  I've spent lot's of time in Chicago and despite coworkers rating it at \"you must try it\", I didn't care to spend the time in line but when they opened up shop near work I gave it a try.  Quality, freshness, pricing were good and service was entertaining.  Glad I arrived for a slightly early lunch as it got crowded quickly near noon (Shea location).
