Why doesn't Yelp let us give 0 stars? Because giving this place one star would be beyond generous. We walked into this buffet expecting to eat some delicious Chinese food and not hair....that's right my friend found hair in the food! Absolutely gross and disgusting and definitely lost my appetite at that point. The buffet had a lot of food options, but they did not have signs up to explain what you were eating. I had to guess what the food was by looking at it half the time. Also, the noodles I got were really crispy, as if overcooked or they were left out for days. We spent 17 Canadian dollars for the meal or lack of, so definitely overpriced and not worth it. Save your money and go somewhere else!
