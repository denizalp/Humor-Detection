I was looking for a Krav Maga class near my home. I went to this school to ask questions about the program. The people I talked to we're not forthcoming with answers at all. High pressure sells tactics were used. I was introduced to the instructor who had only a couple of months experience with Krav. It appears this school wants to pressure people into spending money and be taught by someone with very little experience.
