Okay, I had a good review going. My family and I lasted two weeks there. Just in that we went through one management company coming in and than another. I wish I could post this annomyus but, oh lord.  Someone lit the mail boxes on fire the day I left, Two Shootings in a week, a robbery, party people everywhere,and, I could go on and on. Very scary at night. I've seen quite a few fights. Neighbors love drama and to be in eveyones business. And, Don't ever rent 278... That's the reason I moved out. Some punk kid left and let all the partiers take over his apartment he walked out of... It SMELLS so bad and multiple neighbors and I have complained and complained to the office and maintenance. The maintenance walked in and out of it and locked it never to go in again. It should be quarantined but, no one wants to go near it the stench is so bad. We all saw maintenance walk in and out and say some curse words and left. Just by opening the door I could smell it accross and down the hall...
