My best friend got married here this weekend and it was a nice place. Definitely the least tackiest of all chapel in Vegas. But I had to take two stars off because \n\n* 1. My best friend told them two times that she HATES roses ! To 2 different people and when she arrived they had roses ready for her. So she declined all flower services ( which is sad not to have any for your marriage but oh well, they're fault) and they said she never mentioned anything. Which is a lie because I was there both times when she mentioned it on the phone and I told her she was being dramatic but obviously she needed to emphasize it more. \n\n* 2. They told us from the beginning we can only get 1 limo but when they saw our party split the limo driver said we could of gotten another limo if we asked. We did but the chapel said we couldn't. Go figure. \n\n* 3. MOST IMPORTANTLY \nOn top of the everything, you have 2 photographers. One is the primary photographer which is RED and he doesn't take good pictures ( red is the one included in your package) & the other is GREY which has ALL the good pictures and with the group! So if you want those you have to pay AT LEAST $1,000 for a few pictures. So make sure you have someone behind the photographer taking pictures with their phone as well or something. \n\nIt would of been five stars if they were more attentive to the couples needs. But they are just money hungry. So just prepare if you decide to book because it is a nice atmosphere.
