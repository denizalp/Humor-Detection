Ok Yelpers.  Don't show up unannounced.  Take some advise from Chips and set up an appointment with my main man Andy Wong.  Trust me on this, you dont want to be just standing around not being assisted by anyone.  The location has an Optometrist on site.  Opt Fee: $75.   After my eye exam, I was presented with the fact that I was near sighted and also require bi-focals.  I kind of want to stop writing this review and sulk but,,, lol.     Andy will guide you painlessly through the rest.  The place has a great selection.  Go!  You wont be disappointed.\nBTW:  I can see!!,, OMG,, I can see!!!   Peace!
