Fancy pants restaurant in fancy pants Yorkville.\n\nThe gnocchi is as good as the old guy in the hat playing the piano in the back. Classy stuff, for sure.\n\nA drunk woman approached my girlfriend in the bathroom and told my girlfriend that some random guy drives a Lexus, \"which is basically a Toyota.\" My girlfriend didn't care, as we took the bus there, being students and all.\n\nAll in all, a great experience.\n\n4\/5
