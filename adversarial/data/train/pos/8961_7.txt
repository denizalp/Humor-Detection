This is an updated review for the (new) salon. I've been coming to Farida for years at her home and have been pleased with my results every time. She has a nice salon in the Arcadia area and although it's not close to my work or home, I will make a trip because she is worth it. Lots of parking in this strip mall and several seats inside for waiting your turn.\n\nNo longer a hidden gem due to the popularity and the amount of reviews, but I am so happy for Farida's success because she is a wonderful lady with some skills. Her daughter Asra is talented as well and does great work. Getting your eyebrows or other facial areas threaded can be uncomfortable but the end result is better than any alternative.
