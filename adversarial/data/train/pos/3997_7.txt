Oh my gosh.\nTeresa found out I had never had Korean food and we came here after a few wonderful pints at Duggan's Brewery.\nWhen we walked inside I was like, this is a bar, the food won't be very good.\nIt was long and narrow and dark and at the back there were two high top tables and maybe 4 low top tables (in the back and along one side wall).\n\nWe ordered the bulgogi cheesesteak and kimchi pork belly fried rice.\nHEAVEN IN MY MOUTH.\nThis was revolutionary in my life because I am now obsessed. I want to eat that at least 3x a week.\n\nSo freakin' good. The buttery bun that the cheesesteak was on was heavenly. The fried rice was delicious and it had such nice flavours and spice and I loved the egg on it. Droooools.\n\nService was great. Water was always filled. \n\nCame to about $20.\nThey had bone shaker on tap but not too many other beers that I was a fan of.\nFood was dynamite though.\n10\/10 would come again.
