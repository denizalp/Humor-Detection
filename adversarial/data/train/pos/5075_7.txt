I really enjoyed this experience at Lumiere for restaurant week! We were seated at our table at the time of our reservation and greeted by our waiter to take our drinks. We ordered a bottle of wine and were brought the amuse-bouche of warm vichyssoise and gougeres, which really warmed the soul. I could have had a whole meal of that soup and about a dozen of those little puffs of cheese bread!! But like the waiter said, \"we'll do better than that\", and they did! I ordered the carnarolin risotto which was gulf shrimp and mushrooms, the salmon and cheese plate for the dessert course. Everything was perfectly timed and perfectly cooked. I don't normally order salmon because I usually like it on the undercooked side which often is not done correctly. This salmon was perfect! It was done sous-vide and could not have tasted any better with the creamed spinach and sauce. The wait staff was well informed and did their job to perfection. I went into this evening with no expectations and was very impressed.
