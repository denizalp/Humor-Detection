So adorable. Super hipster. Decided to eat here bc of the great reviews while during my Cleveland Trip, located in the Tremont neighborhood. \n\nCame here July weekend, are here on July 4th. It was cool they were open on this national holiday. The line was pretty busy with maybe 10 people ahead of us, we didn't have reservations but everyone wanted outdoor seating. We were seated right away. \n\nEverything made here, as explained by our waiter, is homemade\/in-house and the ingredients are all from farms within 100 mile radius. Very cool and locale-ish.\n\nI ordered the strawberry and rhubarb waffles! So delicious. Sweet and slightly tangy fresh fruit topping cover my milky and crispy, yet soft waffle.\n\nI also ordered the pecan crusted bacon! Crunchy\nAnd sweet at the same time. I would fly back all the way from the bay just to have these two things again.
