just looking at the catagory that INFINITY'S END is placed on makes me think the owner was on a good supply of \"tobacco\" when this was put up. (i know the owner didn't create the yelp page. but u get the point)\n\nI come her all the time for little things.... Ahhhemm!!!\ngood incense, (10 =1.00)... i always spend at least 4-5 bucks on them alone. Nothing like a good smelling scent to set the mood after a long day.. RIGHT????  righttttt!!!!!!\n\nThey DO HAVE \"sketchy\" looking employess but hey.. what do they suppose to look like considering. Always ready to help and answer questions. \n\nthe T-Shirts are a-lot-a-bit on the HIGH side for my liking. (80's Tees . com is my fav for vintage shirts of alllll kind... THANK ME LATER IF U CHECK THEM OUT... and show me some love..lol)\n\nposters, signs, pipes (wind blown) etc are there to gaze at. On 4\/20 they have live Wind Blowing shows and the store is 20-50 percent off. \n\nCheck em out.... I come to this location more often. \n\nThe sale skateboards and all that good stuff too..\n\nGo Hemp!! \n(funny.. 50 yrs ago.. That would be the norm of a statement)
