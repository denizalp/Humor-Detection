Used the coupon for the free roastburger at this location and the manager let my coupon slide even though I guess I didn't print coupon the right way.  She was telling me some guy walked in there earlier and tried to use 8 coupons for himself.  Was he planning on eating 8 roastburgers and 8 soft drinks in one sitting?  Crazy bastard.  \n\nIts just a roast beef sandwich dressed up in burgers clothing.  Ketchup and roast beef don't taste that great together imo.  Bun was good though.  My wife got the bacon and cheddar and thought it was fantastic but I felt pretty unsatisfied with my All-American.
