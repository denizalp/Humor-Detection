Wandered into this spot for drinks (and drinks only) after dinner on a Friday night. It's a bit muddy in there; dim lighting, not too loud, and everything's got the faintest touch of, let's call it, \"history.\" But it's charming in an art deco kind of way, and I can imagine a lot of mysterious trysts have transpired under the Paddock's roof. Probably a few mob hits too.\n\nAlthough there is ample seating at their tables, you'll want to pony up to the expansive bar. The L-shaped beast has to be at least 30 feet long, with old-school stools that swivel, and super-friendly bartenders who are quick to suggest a decent shot. They seemed to have a lot of beers on tap (I'd guess 10) including Big Rock, so I was a fan. Don't really know what drinks cost, but it seemed reasonable for the locale.\n\nThis place has a vibe that suggests almost anything can go down in this place. With a small patio out front, I see potential.\n\nObligatory Title Pun: Give this DOCtor a spin.\n\nMenu Readability: Like I said, drinks and drinks only. I'll come back and report.\n\nNeed to mention: Pretty small washroom, brah. Don't go if you value privacy.\n\nWhat this place teaches me about myself: I might look good in a fedora. No, probably not.
