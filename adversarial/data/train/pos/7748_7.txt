Found this place in the Palazzo when we were looking for a place close by Wynn that wasn't too expensive and yet not food court food.\n\nOriginally ordered the Maui Rib Eye ($28), but it came out well-done instead of medium rare... Non-edible.  Since they were going to make a new one, I opted for the regular Rib Eye Steak. The Maui Rib Eye was too sweet for me, and took away all the meat flavors. The flavor of the regular Rib Eye was just perfect. I opted for a side of Asparagus instead of a baked potato.\n\nGreat service! The waitress took one look at my well-done steak and offered to bring me one that was prepared right.
