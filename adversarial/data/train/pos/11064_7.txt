Not bad, not bad.  As other's have suggested elsewhere, don't over do it on the condiments and you'll be fine.  The patties are hand form and this alone makes them better than any fast food joint where the patties are pre-formed.\n\nFive Guys is one step up from regular fast food burger places.  You won't find a drive through here and your burger is made when you order it.  A regular Hamburger will come with two patties so if you're really wanting just one, you'll want to order the Little Hamburger.\n\nThis place is located across the parking lot from the Outlet Mall, so do some shopping\/walking and then do some eating, or the other way around.  Either way, take in some calories and burn some calories.  When you walk in the door, you will probably be greeted with some form of welcome.  Note the bags of potatoes on the floor that tell you what kind of fries you'll be having today.  Oh, and you will be having fries, right?  Live like me and go for the Cajun fries.  Mmmm.\n\nWalk up to the counter and place your order.  They have a long list of toppings to choose from but don't get carried away.  After placing your order, have a seat.  It will take a few minutes.  Bring your phone so you can spend time Yelping or playing games.  \n\nOh yeah, almost forgot.  While you're waiting, they have a treat for you.  Shelled peanuts.  Just go on up to the barrel and take a paper bowl and fill it to your heart's content.  Head to your seat and eat away.  Remove shell first.\n\nYour burger's gonna come wrapped in a soft foil.  The buns are really soft and end up getting mashed a bit, but it's still good this way.  This tends to be a sloppy burger as it's being eaten, so keep it partially wrapped as you go.\n\nAnd one order of fries is enough for a couple of people (you get a bunch).\n\nThey do a nice job of keeping the place clean even when it's busy.
