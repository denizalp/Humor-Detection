A live confession of me reviewing this church? :)  This church is located on the Strip, good for out of towners looking to share their thoughts with God when traveling.  \n\nI should begin that I confess that I make my way to come to this particular church during Lent\/Holy Week\/Easter\/Christmas.  \n\nIts a very large church so it usually can seat everyone attending Mass on Easter or Christmas, it is beautifully decorated and they have daily Mass at various times throughout the day. It is actually posted out in the front of the church.  Keep in mind that this is not a Parish.   \n\nI have had several different Priests that lead Mass, and most of them leave you with things to think about of why you are there to attend Mass.  BUT I did experience one priest here that chops the regular one hour mass to 30 minutes, I mean he speeds through mass.  We were late to midnight mass for Christmas (I know bad..) about 15 minutes, and they were already doing Eucharist and then about 10 minutes later, mass ended.   So we came back in the morning because we felt we missed out!  \n\nThat was funny to me, but something I wanted to share with my fellow worshipers. \n\nPeace be with you all.
