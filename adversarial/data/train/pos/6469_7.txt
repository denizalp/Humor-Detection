Super cute little coffee shop with wooden floors and the unfriendliest vibe I've found in Pittsburgh.  I'm a newb to Pittsburgh and I'm used to people wanting to shoot the sh*t with me.  Not here.  Not a customer nor an employee was warm or friendly.  Does this place think it's too hip for me?  Think again, yo.  You are in Pittsburgh, not South Beach.\n\nDespite not liking the cliquey atmosphere, I did love the look of the place and the relaxing old dixieland jazz music.  I might actually return here to study.  The coffee smelled really good - but I had chai.
