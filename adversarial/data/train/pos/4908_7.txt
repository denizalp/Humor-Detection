Unfortunately, this place uses high pressure tactics to get more money out of its guests. They will tell you things like it's between you and girl as to what happens in the VIP room know full well that nothing is going to happen. You get your basic lap dance and that's all! The private dance is way over priced from the beginning. Just negotiate the price down to what is normal. No lap dance is $300 for 30 minutes! So, stick to your guns and don't go for the lie. They even tried to pressure me for a tip! Saying the normal top is $700! They are out of their minds! \n\nI will never go to this place again because they treat you like your new a mark. I personally had a better time at Treasures. At least there the women were nicer and I didn't feel like I was at a time-share presentation. DON'T GO!
