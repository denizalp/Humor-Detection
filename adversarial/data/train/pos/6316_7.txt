The menu is thoughtful and the house decor offers a cohesive gesture of casual. Tv's and charming booty butts everywhere, kinda like any given home that offers good food, tv and a honey combined for a gratifying result. \n\nMy stomach was rumbling this late morning so I ordered up the BLT with a fried egg and a side of sweet potato fries and water. A solid meal that came in at $8. I was in need of a relaxing moment to fuel up with a sentimental meal that would ease my mind and uplift my spirit. \n\nThe guys and gals delivered.
