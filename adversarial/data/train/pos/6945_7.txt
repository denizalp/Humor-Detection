As a guest of the Cosmopolitan, I visited the pool during the day which is A-OK. Of the 3 pools at the Cosmo, Marquee is THE party pool, so if you want quiet chill time this locale is probably not for you. \n\nI had perhaps a bit of an atypical experience when visiting the \"Nightclub.\" The first part of the night I was attending a private party that had open bar and was fully catered. Great cocktails! The bartenders are obviously well-skilled and know how to poor a mean drink.  \n\nI don't know what kitchen prepares the food, but I have to say I had the very best ever ribeye I've ever had in my life! Directly from the carving board (poor guy did not know how to cut meat, but didn't matter) to my plate to my mouth. A whole ribeye slow roasted for 15 hours served from a poolside buffet - who would've thunk it? :) The JUMBO coconut shrimp were also a huge hit! The staff couldn't keep the trays full.  \n\nHaving already been inside decided to check out the inside club (no line, no cover - yay!). Super crowded, loud DJ, house music, I'm finally too old for that scene - or at least too old to not enjoy being pushed around and have drinks spilled on me anymore, so we only stayed for one - plus we had another private event at another Casino to attend. \n\nIf you're young and hip (not hip replacement), rumor is Marquee is THE hot club on The Strip right now - so party on boys and girls! Here's Anthony Bourdain's take: \"Come ye lords and princelings of douchedom. Hear my clarion call. Anointeth thyself with gel and heavenly body spray. Maketh the sign of the devil horns with thine hands. Let there be the high fiving and the hugging of many bros, for this is the kingdom and the power. Now frolic and maketh it to rain.\" I couldn't say it better....first, I'm not as brilliant as Tony...and who else can talk like that? ;)
