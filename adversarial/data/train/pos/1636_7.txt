Never go to this restaurant! It's one of the worst places I've ever been to! The staff is rude and unprofessional! The crowd is loud and the food is nuked in the microwave and should be considered fast food. With the selection of restaurants in this city, this should be last on your list! Don't bother! Stay home.
