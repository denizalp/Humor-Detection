We came to Texas Roadhouse for Mother's Day dinner and will not be back.  We called ahead and got a pager # for our party of 5 and were told 30 min wait.  There were 4 of us waiting and a 5th on their way so we were going to need an odd sized regardless.  Our 5th ended up getting stuck in traffic when our # was called.  Here is what transpired at the hostess stand:\n\nHostess: Great, is all your party here?\nMe: Yes the 4 of us are here and our 5th is stuck in traffic\nHostess: Well I need all of your party here to seat you.\nMe: I understand, there are 4 of our 5 and the other almost here.\nHostess: We can't seat you until your entire party is here.\nMe: I understand, she is moments away and it is one person in a part of five, not like we are holding a table and waiting for several people.\nHostess: We don't seat incomplete parties.\nMe: I understand that.\nHostess: We have a sign. (points to sign that says 'we don't seat incomplete parties')\nMe:  Yes I see the sign\nHostess: we have two signs. (points to another sign that says 'we don't seat incomplete parties')\nMe: .......\nHostess: (gestures to both signs again)\nMe: so are being penalized because our friend is stuck in traffic?\nHostess: I already told you, we don't seat incomplete parties.\n\nSo now we are back to waiting and our friend ended up not coming so we wouldn't have to wait another 20 min to be seat.  Thanks for helping us make wonderful family memories, Texas Road House!  Happy Mother's Day!
