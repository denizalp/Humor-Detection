Great little French restaurant that just opening.  Still working on the dinner menu, I was told.  Stopped in for lunch and the menu was very interesting and reasonably priced.  \nAnother customer told me that the Chef was at Tartine in the West End before coming here.  \nMy Poire had fresh pear, a mild blue cheese, candied walnuts, and a sweet honey glaze on grill bread.  A tasty little meal with some sweetness from the honey.  \nBYOB.\nA nice addition to the neighborhood!
