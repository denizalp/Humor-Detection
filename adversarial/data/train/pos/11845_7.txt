Yay! I'm a fan... of the staff and the doctor, but that is as excited as I can get for a dental place. I hate going to the dentist, but this place isn't all too bad. Dr. Kim is very gentle and never makes me feel uncomfortable. I got a teeth cleaning and 2 fillings at this place. He really did a good job on the fillings and I will be going back in 6 months for my next cleaning appointment. I subtracted one star from 5 because I hate dental places, otherwise it would be 5. I know its not fair... but WHAT IS fair in life?;)
