I'd like to start by making a confession.  I'm not a big fan of Italian food overall, nor do I think NY style pizza is the best pizza.\n\nPhew...not that that's off my chest, I can get to my 5 star review!\n\nMy first trip to Rocco's was after a night out with my brother and quite a few libations.  Let me just say that the pastrami & corned beef combo sandwich does wonders for the late night cravings!  I think I got through about 1\/2 of it before giving up...which may likely still equate to about 2 lbs of sandwich.\n\nAbout a week later, my son was craving pizza, which is not unusual to be the case almost daily for a growing 8 year old boy.  I, on the other hand, was not craving pizza.  I recalled seeing some pizza by the slice options at Rocco's, so off we went!  My son was thrilled as the guy behind the counter cut him \"a slice\" of pizza.  If you weren't aware, apparently in New York, a slice equates to 1\/4 of a full sized pizza.  What kid wouldn't love that?\n\nI saw the major league baseball sized rice balls and opted for one of those.  Then I spotted a delicious looking beef dish in marinara sauce and had to learn more.  Once the \"bragiole\" was described to me, I decided I had to have that as well!  \n\nMy son and I sat at a little table and enjoyed what I think was maybe the best Italian dinner I've ever had!  I couldn't ask for better company, a better environment, and better food.  The whole experience easily earned a 5 star rating from me.  This may become a regular tradition for us.
