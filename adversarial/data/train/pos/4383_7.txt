Was a huge fan of the other locations and now we have our own in dtw! The prices are good, food is fresh and lots of different options. Green goddess and stoner shells are must haves. I love the margarita with the Chile powder rim. There has been quite a wait to get in even on weeknights, that is the only downside.
