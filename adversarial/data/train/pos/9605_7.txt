\"You are an artistic person - let your colors show.\"\nThat's what my fortune cookie said during my first meal at Sunshine Moon Peking Pub the other night.  I say \"first meal\" because I  know there will be more... (and hopefully better fortunes than that one too!)\n\nRich and his team did a great job renovating this restaurant where Bacon used to reside.  It's now got a cool Asian vibe while still casual and welcoming.  Service (from Kelly and James) was friendly and attentive.  \n\nWe took their recommendations and ordered the following:\n\n*Veggie Spring Rolls\n*Chilled Cucumber Salad\n*Soft Noodles (with Chicken and a fried egg)\n*Mushroom Purse\n*Shrimp in Lobster Sauce\n\nI know... that's a lot of food for two people, right?!\n\nWell, it sure was but we were hungry, and we did pretty well with it.  We polished off the spring rolls, cucumber salad, and mushroom purse and ended up taking home leftovers of the soft noodles and shrimp.  \n\nI really enjoyed the spring rolls and cucumber salad; I probably could've made a meal on those two menu items alone!  I also liked the mushroom purse - it includes all kinds of funky mushrooms prepared in what I think was a paper \"purse\" of some sort.  I tasted ginger with the mushrooms, which is a good thing if you're like me and like ginger!  I love the concept of the soft noodles with a fried egg on top - everything is better with an egg on it!  This dish was lacking a bit of zing, but we added hot chile sauce to it and that did the trick.  The shrimp was tasty but similar to every other \"shrimp in lobster sauce\" dish I've had in the past.\n\nThe one thing I'd like to see added to SMPP's menu is eggplant; I'm a huge eggplant fan and order it pretty much where ever I go! Regardless, even without eggplant, I'm really happy to have another Chinese option close to home.  \n\nSMPP is currently open for dinner six days a week (they are closed on Mondays).  They plan on opening for lunch in 2011.\n\nOh... and the point of me starting this review with my fortune? There was none; just wanted to share.  Feel free to share yours too!
