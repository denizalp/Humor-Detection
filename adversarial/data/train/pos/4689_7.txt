Steak house and all day breakfast.  There is even a breakfast option that comes with a steak.  I would probably never eat steak here.\n\nThe good:\n- There was no line, but it was busy, and busy with locals (good sign)\n- Everything was dirt cheap for breakfast\n- The food came out really fast\n- There are signed photos of 'celebrities' on the wall including Silver Elvis and Mike Myers\n- The portions were MASSIVE for the money (there were about 6 slices of bacon with my bacon & eggs)\n- It was very efficient - Bill was brought and change returned promptly\n- Appealing graphic design for lunch and dinner special menus\n\nThe bad:\n- The locals were literally the locals from this corner which has a Coffee Time Theory index of 3 out of a possible 3.  Everyone in here was pretty trashy.  \n- The food was pretty mediocre \n- My eggs were undercooked but I didn't really care\n- Their coffee is borderline terrible\n\nBottom line - this place was fast and cheap but I would never come here again.
