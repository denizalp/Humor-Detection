They had a fire in the Phantasy\/ Chamber\/whatever complex a few months ago. This is my first visit post fire. Or even in the last five years. It's exactly the same. Same people(goth Ric Ocasek), same music( Rammstein??!! eegads!), same bar staff and probably the same beer from five years ago. A friend was in town and wanted to drop in, so we obliged.\n Newest update: they play True Blood on tv instead of horror movies. It was season 2, which isn't out on dvd yet. That means they were showing tapes. That's dedication. The smoke damage smell is still very prevalent, and when combined with the exposed wooden beams overhead, it feels like a gothic steakhouse. Forbidden Corral? \nThe bathrooms actually seem cleaner. Scrubbing out soot will help a toilet immensely. Ironically, they have a patio out back for smoking,  which in no way could smell as smoky as it does inside the club now. Like the sulfurous pits of hell!
