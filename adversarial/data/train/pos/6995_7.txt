As a straight guy getting my haircut falls down around the things I hate to do the most.  Since I recently moved to Charlotte, finding a new person to cut my hair makes the experience even a bigger pain in the as*.\n\nI walk to work since I live and work in the center city and one day I  strolled by Volume Salon on 5th Street.  Situated in kinda the middle of nowhere, I set up an appointment mainly because of the convenience.\n\nWhen I arrived my coat and brief case was taken and I was offered a drink...........wine...........ugh.  I asked for beer, but no can do.  Funny thing is I found out a ton of guys go here........yet STILL no beer?  Other places have wine AND beer..but not them...so they lose a star for that fact.\n\nCarrie was the person schedule to cut my hair....you don't actually think I'm going to use the word stylist do you???  Really...seriously?\n\nSo back to Carrie....she is great.  She ask questions, listens and is a good carrying on the conversation.  \n\nShe has cut my hair a few times and the last time I really loved the cut as it was a bit shorter than before...I asked her if she could remember it for the next time and she told me she is going to write it down!  A first...I've never heard someone cutting my hair say that to me, so they gain a star.\n\nThey offer a lot of services...waxing every part of your body is an option....if you are into that kind of thing??\n\nPricing is very reasonable for a dunking and cut and they actually gave me a $5 discount because they realized they over charged me $5 3 week ago which I was not aware....add a star!  But the only issue is that they no long allow tips on credit cards....cash only...ugh!  I feel like I'm back in Chicago again????  It's a banking town for god sake....businesses need to get with the plan EVERYONE carries plastic around here, so I have to make sure I have cash with me....or Carrie better hope I remember.\n\nBut it is a great little place to get a dunking and cut in the center city.
