I like Costco, but I'm a fan of their gas station.  The place is orderly, the pumps are well-maintained and clean, and the discounted price for gas is worth making a deliberate trip to Costco rather than just finding another favorite, convenient gas station along your way to...wherever you're going.\n\nThe details:  \n\nPrice:  the gas is noticeably discounted.  Even though there are multiple gas lanes (more than many other gas stations!) and a significantly large area for folks to queue up, we recently went through a period where the silly line was out to the street.  Why?  The gas was almost 40 cents cheaper than the average price here in Summerlin.  The discount's not normally that deep, but it happens.\n\nPumps:  as mentioned, there are more pumps than many gas stations, and with the large area for folks to line up, it makes things go smoothly.  Even when there are long lines.  There's also only one way through the pumps, eliminating the chaos of having cars pointed nose-to-nose, tail-to-tail, etc.  There are also passing lanes between the pumps to allow cars to pull through when the pump in the front opens up or the car in back is ready to leave first.\n\nPersonnel:  there's a full-time attendant there.  He'll give you assistance and even pump your gas if you needed help, and he also keeps the pumps clean.  Yes, the pumps are actually routinely wiped down and kept clean, and the ground around the pumps are kept litter-free.  Spills are cleaned up immediately.  The curbs around the pumps are maintained and painted.  This is the attendant at work.  He also walks around greeting folks, and ensures people are parked properly to pump their gas and depart quickly.\n\nIf you're a member of Costco, don't pass up the opportunity to fuel your car at their pumps.
