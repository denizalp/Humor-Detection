This hotel is disappointingly over-rated. Based on prices and the looks of the lobby area, I assumed that the rooms would equate to Bellagio or Venetian, but unfortunately I was actually more impressed by the rooms at MGM. \n\nFirst of all, if you get the golf course view you will hear the club music all night. Then at 3 am when the music stops, you'll hear the youngsters come back to their rooms to finish the party because the walls are so thin. The beds are also a little older and uncomfortable-- their was a dent that rolled us into the center. There was something sticky on all the pamphlets on the desk and throughout the hallway floor, so housekeeping standards aren't too high. The pamphlets were actually already written on, so I guess they just don't switch them out. \n\nCustomer service was great and everyone is always smiling and friendly. It wasn't an awful experience, I just had higher expectations.
