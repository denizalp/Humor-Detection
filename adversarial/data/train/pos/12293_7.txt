Originally I came in for prices since every radio shop tries to rape you in town. These guys are seriously professional and know sound. They will keep everything upfront and real. No crazy add on fees or hustle. Good prices and great installation. I haven't had a problem and will keep coming here for all my vehicles. I suggest this place over all places in Las Vegas. Btw my truck sounds perfect. I get complements about how pure the bass sounds and doesn't rattle.
