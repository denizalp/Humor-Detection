Used to be impressed with this place. Not any more! Went there for supper on 8\/27\/13, 7:45. Wife and I ordered soup and sandwich with drinks.  $18.76 for a cup of soup and a sandwich? Wow! \n I ordered a \"Big Nasty\". I have had this many times and always enjoyed it. Not on this nite. Waitress brought our meal and my sandwich consisted of a sliced bun with beef on top....... No gravy, no cheese! When I asked the waitress what this was, she looked very confused. When wife asked about the gravy she looked more confused and the said \"Oh, you want gravy?\" And promptly left. She returned a few minutes Later with a small cardboard cup with a small amount of gravy in it, which she sat on the table and walked off. No comment....\n I poured the gravy on my sandwich and commenced to eat it without the cheese. One bite and I found the gravy was cold. Not room temperature cold mind you, I am talking refrigerated cold! My wife lost it and grabbed my plate and went to the counter. About 5 minutes lated the waitress returned with a correct \"hot\" complete sandwich. She hung around apologizing while I ate and returned 3 or 4 times to apologize more. \n Some guy came by to ask us if we wanted more drinks, when it was quite obvious we didn't. In hind sight that may have been a manager. Not quite sure.\n Not a pleasant dining experience to say the least. Waitress did not have a clue and management was........was not!  \n\nI went to the McAlister web site to do a survey. It requires a store code from your receipt. No such code on my receipt!
