Real Rating: 4.5 stars\n\nRRL provides a dining experience unlike any other! Excellent decor, Grammy-grade entertainment and delicious food. How can you go wrong with that? \n\nTIP: If you're not hungry, RRL is still an ideal place to grab a drink before you hit the town. If you're looking to impress your girl, take her here. \n\nLOCATION: Finding RRL isn't entirely easy, and I think they did it on purpose - probably to add some mystery or secrecy. Also, when you finally arrive, you'll quickly understand why they have it nestled in some random wing of The Cosmo. If you're having trouble locating it, just ask any hotel staff member and they'll point you in the right direction. \n\nENTERTAINMENT: The live singers are, without a doubt, some of the best singers AND performers I've ever witnessed live. Putting their own twist on major hits throughout the last several decades, the band never disappointed. Never. \n\nFOOD: \n\nHerb Brioche Rolls ~ 4 stars\nPotato Gratin ~ 4 stars\nGlazed Brussels Sprouts ~ 4 stars\nSteak Frites ~ 4 stars\nShort Rib Stroganoff ~ 5 stars ~ A MUST\nDuck Confit Pasta ~ 5 stars ~ A MUST\n\nEVERYTHING we had was delicious. Seasoned perfectly. Cooked perfectly. However, where RRL hits it right on the nail is in the pasta department. The stroganoff and duck confit pasta were out of this world. My only regret was not doubling up on those orders. The short rib in the stroganoff was succulent, deep flavored and dangerously addicting. The duck confit was seasoned a bit aggressively but necessary because when paired with the handmade pasta, it was nothing short of spectacular. \n\nRose. Rabit. Lie. is awesome. Don't just expect a dining experience. It's an experience that will tingle ALL your senses. Have fun.
