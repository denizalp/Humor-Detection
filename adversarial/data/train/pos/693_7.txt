Pass by this place all the time, and had no idea how much I was missing out on! Good Catch is kind of a hybrid seafood joint and sports bar, both of which are always of interest to me.\n\nFOOD:\n\nCame here mostly for the Lobster Roll. It was a bit on the small-side, but had a surprising number of chunks of lobster meat. The cold version that I ordered, came in a mayo-based sauce as is quite common. They also offer a 'hot' version of this, which is dressed in a warm sauce. This dish was accompanied by a side of Cajun fries, which seemed as though they made fresh, as well as a small side of Caesar salad. The Soft-shell Crab Sandwich was also a bit on the small side, but again hit the spot - crispy on the outside, and garnished with a mango\/onion mix. \n\nSERVICE:\n\nOur server was quite enthusiastic, friendly, and eager to assist. Food came surprisingly fast, though it was a slower weekday evening. \n\nATMOSPHERE:\n\nI'm sure this place is already trending, as it's got a great vibe to it. Seems like a great place to dine, have a drink, or just watch the game. Did I mention that this place has a nice big screen? Also has a bunch of smaller screens by the bar to keep up with the sports.\n\nVERDICT:\n\nI will definitely be back for food, and to catch a game or two.
