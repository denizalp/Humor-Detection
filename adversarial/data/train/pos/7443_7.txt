It is a great addition to Huntersville, but it isn't a great Earth Fare.  Asheville is much nicer, even South Charlotte is IMO.\n\nIt feels cramped.  The parking, the inside, just the whole deal.  It looks like they would have all the room they wanted.\n\nThe food is nice, but a little over priced(expected).  Plenty of free samples for now, a hot bar, a juice bar, everything a healthnut\/foodie could ever want.\n\nThe beer selection is good, but rather small.\n\nAll these 5 star reviews seem a little much especially with how bad the parking situation is, but to each their own, I guess.\n\nI don't really know what else to say, but I'm sure the Harris Teeter across the street ain't happy.
