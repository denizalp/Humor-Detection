So I had my appointment no more than two hours ago but I cannot express enough how pleased I am with my lashes. More than that, the experience was more than pleasant. Angela is so calming during the entire appointment. She explains everything clearly each step of the way and makes sure to give you exactly what you're asking for. Communicating with her is a breeze. She will text you to both establish a time and confirm the day before. When you are lying down for your appointment she plays calming music so you feel relaxed the whole time. I even fell asleep a few times. Lol. After I apologized for it, she told me it was okay and that it was good for me to nap. You get both a great experience with Angela and beautiful results. I can't wait until my next appointment. Im typing this with my phone so I'll update and post my pics for everyone's reference later tonight.
