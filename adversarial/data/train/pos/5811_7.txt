Pressure!  Upsell!  Upsell!  \n\nThese guys do a good job with a car wash.  The gas here tends to be a few cents more\\gal.  I used them for an oil change as well today.  Never again.  1st off, I have a company car that is administered by a fleet management company.  I pull up, pull out the fleet card.  \"Do you guys take this?\"  Hand card to guy.  Looks it over.  \"Yea, we take this one.\"  Turns out they don't & I get dinged for $20 for going out of network.  Thanks.  For this the manager comped my $20 car wash.  And I had to spend 10 minutes hassling with them when I was already snarky from running the UPSELL GAUNTLET that you are forced to endure for 15 minutes which I detail below.\n\nThis is the second Danny's I've been to and I'm ready to try another car wash.  I don't need to be hounded by not 1, not 2 but 3 different people trying to sell me:\n\n-repair of a small crack in my windshield.  I've got it covered, thanks.  I have a guy I use for that.  No, really I don't want it done today.  No, I don't care if it will only take ten minutes.  No.\n\n-replacement of said windshield.  No, I'm good.  No, I don't need someone at my house or office tomorrow.  No.\n\n-When is the last time you had your power steering fluid changed?  No.  No.\n\n-Your transmission fluid...No.  No.\n\n-The fluid in your differential...Do you know what a differential is?  Wow.  Talk down to somebody like they are ignorant about cars.  That's a great selling technique.  Yes, I know what a differential is Mr. Mensa, do you know why cars need a differential?  To push the wheels with the transmission?  Yes. Very good.  Did you know the wheels move at different speeds when your car is not traveling in a straight line, Mr. Mensa?  No.  No.\n\n-This is your air filter.  This is your air filter on dust.  Whatever, put it back.  No.  No.\n\n-When is the last time you had your radiator flushed?  You should know that blah blah blah.  No.  No.  A thousand times no!\n\nIf you've been to a time share sales pitch-that's the sales tactics going on here.  No thanks.  I'm sure that my $30 oil change could easily have become a $400 sale.  No.
