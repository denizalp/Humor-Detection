After an hour long search for new eats that had us aimlessly wondering through Calgary's southwest, our indecisiveness was eventually rewarded with this little gem of a restaurant on 17th.\n\nIt is a relatively small seating area with the tables pretty close together making it a tad awkward as I clumsily worked my way to my seat right by this couple seemingly on a romantic date :).  However the setup made for a nice cozy intimate atmosphere which i tend to favor over the hustle and bustle of a packed diner.\n\nThe service was pleasant and swift , but that could be due to the fact we strolled in 5 minutes until the kitchen closed.  I ordered the spring rolls (pork, sprouts and vermecelli) and the chicken bulgogi.  I found the spring rolls to be on par as they should be and the chicken to be delicious with just enough spice to leave me wanting.  Also coupled with kimchi, radish strips, rice and a piece of green leaf lettuce and you've got yourself quite the flavorful wrap.\n\nI am definitely anxious to hit up this tiny joint again in the future.
