Whether you're a fan of the Beatles or not, go see this show.\n\nGreat for a date.\nGreat for a family.\nGreat for a solo night to find yourself (huh?).\n\n\nYou can spend countless hours reading reviews or you can take my advice and buy the damn tickets.\n\nEven better yet, start the night off at Kokomo's Steak and Seafood. They have combo packages for the two. Bam! Anniversary weekend complete.\n\nYou can thank me later.
