the woman who i think is the manager is a major b**ch.  i don't have a student id anymore b\/c i've already graduated.  i went back for a sorority reunion and they wanted to charge all of the alums without a student id $15 cover.  i asked why they would do that when WE'RE the ones old enough to buy alcohol.  finally they relented,  but the woman at the door snarked, \"You could at least thank me for letting you in.\"  oh my god, thank you for letting me in to your establishment to spend money here.  \n\ndrinks were WEAK and service a bit slow.  bartenders were friendly at least.  they have large booths, so it's good for groups.  expect to see a lot of dry humping, which is unfortunate since this is comparatively a really well lit bar.
