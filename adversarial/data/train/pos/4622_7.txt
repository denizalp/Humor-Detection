This is one of those OK buffets that you would not really write home about - though, I probably will, but then I don't live a very exciting life. But you probably do, so you might want to take a raincheck on this buffet. It's not bad, but for the beautiful Red Rock Casino, I was expecting something a little more special for lunch. They must be saving the good stuff for dinner... at least, we can only hope. \n\nThis buffet falls into that category with the Luxor, you know, where you expected something unique, but you only found cafeteria food. Not bad cafeteria food, but you feel a little short-changed. Service just ok. \n\nThat's it, I have to go send an email now...... \"Dear Mom, Hope you are fine. Today we went to the Red Rock Buffet. It was good if you like cafeteria food. So, how is your cat?\".
