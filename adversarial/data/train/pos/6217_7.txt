stay away from this rip off artist, do not sell your jewelry to her. i had a sterling silver chonco belt and she said it wasnt worth much because the back was copper.  the only part that was copper were the hooks that held the belt on. she offerred me $5.00 for it. i went to another jeweler who offerred me $200.00.  then i saw it on ebay for $700.00.  she told me my topez was not worth anything, but she would buy the gold.  she weighs everthing behind the counter so you cant see and then offers you pennies for your items.  stay away from this women, she is a thief and a liar. im glad i walked out!
