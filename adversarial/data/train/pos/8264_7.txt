Ricky Miles is a fast talker who doesn't care how he makes the deal, just as long as he makes it. He is arrogant and unable to admit when he screws up. He never explained anything, my realtor had to explain step by step everything. I was finally fed up with it and went to another lender where Ricky then proceeded to send me texts over and over blaming me for him not explaining terms for the loan. Supreme lending may be a great company but I would avoid Ricky and his team.\n\n**update** I'm curious as to what logs you would be referring to? Logs ricky kept or actual phone, email and texts? I have my phone records and all my text messages and emails  from ricky and my realtor. My realtor  would tell me she would continually tell Jennifer and Ricky to call me about this and that. Ricky told me several times in emails and texts (which I still have) \"I will get back to you in 15 minutes\" where I then had to text him the next day to ask what happened. AND my realtor is not the one who went with a different lender as you stated. I went and found a new lender because I was tired of not getting stuff explained. My realtor literally explained everything to me until I went with a new lender who I talked to daily till the deal was closed.
