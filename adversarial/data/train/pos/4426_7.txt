Ive been a black card member for a little over 2 months now. I enjoy the fact that they mention no cell phones, why? Otherwise you have some dick shit texting\/dorking around on their phone while sitting on the equipment. This is a huge pet peeve. If youre not going to use the equipment sod off, there are other people waiting to use it while youre just sitting there wasting time. \n\nThe place is always kept clean, by that, I mean the floors and bathrooms. But please, for the love of god, clean off the equipment after you use it. No one wants to sit in your ass sweat. Thats how ring worm gets spread around. Thats why there are several BLATANT, OBVIOUS signs on the walls asking you to clean off the equipment after each use. \n\nHowever, people dont read these. But majority of the users that come in here collectively have the IQ of a grape, its to be expected. I clean off the equipment before and after. I dont want your vag\/ball sweat on me, thanks though. \n\nIve used the tanning booths, the massage tables, and majority of the equipment. Each time I come across someones body sauce left over. Thank goodness they supply us with paper towels and cleaner. \n\nThe place is low key, and gets the job done. I usually come here past 11PM to avoid most of the goons (some of which will watch you\/breathe down your neck when youre using equipment), its quiet and the machinery usually isnt occupied at that time. \n\nThe staff are nice and personable people. They always greet me and say goodbye. Especially the younger female with long brown hair, and the guy that works the weekend nights. \n\nOverall, this is a good start if youre unsure of what to do in order to get into shape. Theres instructions on the equipment with diagrams so you know how to use it and what itll do for you. Its important to take a few seconds to read it over, so that you dont hurt yourself or break the equipment.
