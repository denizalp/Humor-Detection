I've never gone to anyplace but LVAC until now.\nI bought a groupon here,grew deal,decided to take a leap of faith.\nI did myself a favor and took the new client tour=this got me 8 days free before my groupon! I'm still in it!\n\nNow let me get to the ravings....\n~I have nothing to complain about- the classes run all day so you can catch a workout anytime (though Im stuck on Mark's classes!)\n~I love their check in method, front desk is courteous\n~if you need to rent a mat, buy a drink, etc the desk can handle it\n~clean facility\n~well equipped,gorgeous locker room (especially compared to LVAC)\n~my fav-free rev osmosis water for all!!!\n\nOn one of my visits, cirque de soleil performers were here in my class, and supposedly Forest Griffin goes there.\n\nIf you've never done hot yoga before, I may warn you to read the whole website before coming there are very helpful tips such as: don't eat 3 hrs before a class and don't drink too much water while in class (you may throw up), come to class clean(all perfumes\/hairsprays make people nauseous and it will be in your eyes as well), only bring to class what they say,everything else is not necessary.\nAND abide by the yoga room etiquette rules...so rude when people leave,says the staff, but I kinda don't care. Id rather people leave if they have to fart!! LOL the room is hot and stinkin enough.\n\nDon't forget your towel for on top of your yoga mat,it will be soaked from all the sweat off you!\n\nFinally, how I felt after I left= My first class ended at 9pm. I walked outside with my drink and it felt cold outside to my skin, at 100 degrees!! I had to drive with my windows up on the freeway. I felt like I was flying high,almost drunk from the experience. My second day wasn't as surreal, but maybe it's because I need to do another 90 min class instead of a 60!
