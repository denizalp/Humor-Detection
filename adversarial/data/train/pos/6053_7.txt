I've been to Veggie House Vegetarian Restaurant on multiple occasions, and it is one of the few places I consistently recommend to others, regardless if they're vegan\/vegetarians\/omnivores\/carnivores\/t-rexes. \n\nHere's why:\n*The d√©cor is lovely.\n*The service is wonderful.\n*The prices are reasonable (ESPECIALLY the lunch special).\n*Nearly everything is delicious.\n*The menu is massive.\n*They have a charming sign on the door that basically says \"NO MEAT ALLOWED!\" :D\n\nI've had a chance to try multiple dishes and thought I'd provide my thoughts on a few:\n-Curry Chicken with Potato: Possibly my favorite dish. The curry sauce creates the perfect gravy for the chicken and potatoes. An ideal comfort food! \n-Geese: Amazing layers of veggies with a crispy outer crust. I don't know how the Chef makes this one, but it's divine. Pair your leftovers with a salad and you'll have a great lunch the next day. \n-General Tzo Chicken: This is my non-vegetarian boyfriend's most favorite dish. He says it reminds him of Orange Chicken and he literally orders it every single time.\n-Crispy Spicy Eggplant: A lot of reviewers hailed this as the most delicious dish on the menu, but this is where I'm going to have to disagree. I found it to be too sweet and the sauce to be too thick to properly enjoy.\n-Crab Meat Shark Fin Soup: We decided to try something different when we ordered this one with egg drops. It was interesting, but not a hit. I think it would have been better without the egg, so consider that before ordering. \n-Walnut Shrimp: I found the faux-seafood to be too convincing. Ordinarily, that's a compliment to the chef. However, when things taste a little too much like the \"real deal,\" I start to freak out and panic and can't enjoy the meal because I worry I accidentally ate meat. I'm a crazy vegetarian, what can I say.\n-Drinks: No fountain drinks, but a decent selection of canned or bottled sodas and juices. \n\nWorth noting, I have taken both my younger brother (who would live off Carl's Jr. if he could) and boyfriend (who usually threatens to break up with me any time I recommend a vegetarian restaurant for dinner) here and they both loved it just as much as I did. So, rest-assured vegetarians and meat-eaters alike will enjoy this place! You can even bring your pet T-Rex!
