Actually, 3-1\/2 stars, because of the good service and ultra-clean appearance of the restaurant.\n\nStarted off with the Oxtail Chili Cheese fries.  I have never been a fan of oxtail because it is too fatty, and I never liked the way it looked in kare-kare (a filipino dish with stewed oxtail). Plus, red meat isn't a regular part of my diet. I had to taste what everyone was raving about. Yum-yum! It had a nice flavor to it, and the texture was melt-in-your mouth good. It absorbed the chili flavor and color well. The crispiness of the fries was a good contrast to the tenderness of the meat. For the sandwich, I ordered The Crusty Crab. It was a little too much on the sweet side for me - the bun kind of reminded me of Hawaiian bread. I kept waiting for savory, but never got it. I felt a little wired after dinner, (hmmm... maybe that was because I had a Vietnamese coffee!) My partner got the Peking Style Duck Steamed Buns. Her main complaint is that it was dry. I tasted it, and it was ok to me. Oh well, she is a real picky eater - it must have been difficult to feed her when she was a child, Lol...\n\nWe'll be back here, if only to try the other dishes.
