-Broke the door on my sprinkler timer (I have it on security camera)\n-Moved my giant trash-bin to the back corner of my yard and never moved it back.\n-Broke my sprinkler valve and flooded my yard, then blamed it on me (I was in LA at the time).\n-Billed me the full amount for all work-done and also stuck me with a $300 water bill.\n\nThis company is awful - the owner has a huge problem with blaming the customer. They dont give a crap about your personal property either.\n\nGO ELSEWHERE
