Visited on Monday, 10\/26, after receiving an email stating that Monday night football special was the SBC Torta- \"banana leaf roasted pork, refried beans, avocado, mayo, pickled onions, lettuce, on a bolillo roll.  Served with your choice of fries or chips for $12.75.\" http:\/\/s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com\/bphoto\/wT3lzbDQHLPYMYjZqIA9hw\/o.jpg   OK, sold!  I arrived just three minutes after 7p, which meant I'd just missed happy hour (3p to 7p), which is OK, since I only wanted the torta, anyway, and I was only losing out on the $1 off SBC beers- no biggie!  Glad for that service industry discount, though!  \n\nAfter getting a seat at one of the high-tops and having my two servers greet me (guess one's in training), I asked which beers they had that weren't too hoppy and was told of a few that sounded interesting.  After a few seconds of hesitation, the lead said I could sample all three- cool! http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/scottsdale-beer-company-scottsdale?select=9Vgk0-bOwb2lkNzdRwqY3Q  What wasn't cool was that after having one sip of each and my putting them aside for further contemplation, the lead came back and upon asking me if any took my interest, I said no, he took all three away!  Ah, well.  The server-in-training helped me to decide on one of the three based on the best pairing for the torta (I chose SBC Scottish ale), and what a perfect pairing it was!  So good, I easily drank half a pint and probably would've finished another quarter if it weren't for the fact that I was going to get dessert!  But I'm getting ahead of myself... First, the torta, which I'd ordered sans avocado (allergy). http:\/\/s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com\/bphoto\/QzfB7jUeELbdcfCJl7zOig\/o.jpg  The roasted pork was very tender and a little bit swimming in its homemade BBQ sauce (no mustard-yes!), but I'm not complaining!  I detected the creaminess of the refried beans, but I kept wishing I was having a torta from Torta De Los Reyes, instead.  Probably because SBC's version was missing those yellow banana peppers... To make up for the loss, however, this version's crowning glory were the pickled onions!  Oh, yeah!  I almost begged to have more of this pickled veggie delivered, but I restrained myself.  I found the bolillo roll to be a little too soft, as well (it was hard to slice the sandwich into wedges with the steak knife), but that was OK, too, since I wanted to save room for the delicious homemade chips!  At first bite, I thought I detected something fishy, but that previous sip of beer might've affected my tastebuds.  I then honed in on the malted vinegar flavor, and sure enough, the lead server said that the chips have a vinegar and salt flavored seasoning on them.  Light and crispy, and not greasy!\n\nTo cap the meal off, I was drawn to two options, the Peach Cobbler (manager Doug's fave) and the Milk & Cookies, but the cobbler contained cornstarch as a thickener, so Milk & Cookies it was. http:\/\/s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com\/bphoto\/1dOLYpZdZcS8p5ynDPik0g\/o.jpg  Originally made by combining local ice cream shop Sweet Republic's** Vanilla bean ice cream with Bailey's Irish cream, topped with homemade fresh whipped cream, and accompanied by three made-from-scratch SBC's chocolate chip cookies, I asked if mine could be made with Kahlua, instead.  No problem, said Doug.  The $8 adult milkshake was exquisitely delicious, and I'm still dreaming of those crispy-on-the-outside, but gooey-on-the-inside cookies, of which one leftover was still warm when I arrived home, and this was a good thirty minutes, or more, after the dessert arrived at my table!  I'd order this again, for sure, but next time, I'm keeping all of those cookies for myself!  (I offered one of the cookies to an acquaintance's friend, both of whom happened to be seated at the table next to mine, and the guy eagerly accepted the cookie-- drats!  Hehe.)  Here's another look at that divine concoction- http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/scottsdale-beer-company-scottsdale?select=tDkrAiIECGk9cau91_NoOQ\n\nNow, if only SBC would once again offer local Sleepy Dog Brewery's Parched Pooch, as it did on my first visit here.  Pretty please??\n\n**SBC and local ice cream shop Sweet Republic have a \"sweet\" marriage-of-sorts going on, with SBC using SR's ice cream in milkshakes and on the Peach Cobber, as well as having SR's gelato flavors on rotation, while Sweet Republic carries, if I remember correctly, the Texas Tea Stout Chocolate and another flavor incorporating SBC's Hammertime American Stout.  Someone hop over to Sweet Republic to confirm this for me, please- thanks!
