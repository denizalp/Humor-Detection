********************* 1244 **********************\n\n     I've followed Chef CHRIS RECAIDO on Instagram for sometimes now www.Instagram\/C_REC, Have dined at his former place SENSEI sushi inside the Marriott Hotel in Waikiki, Hawaii before. I told myself, I will visit him at Zenshin Asian Restaurant at the South Point Hotel in Las Vegas at some point.\n\n    I come to Vegas average 6 times a year, some trip like the CES one last month, I stayed for 8 days, I finally got to visit Chef Chris Ricaido. All I can say is WOW, I'm impressed.\n\n   If you look at their website, no where mentioned his name besides the owner and the executive chef, or their website is so dated, they even misspell the grape varietal. However, be sure to call in advance, to make sure chef Chris is in, you will be in for a real treat.\n\n   Zenshin Asian Restaurant is spacious, you don't have that feel of a cozy Japanese restaurant. It's big and almost feels as you walk into a cafeteria. However, the oval sushi bar, makes it perfect for foodies, you can watch to chef and cooks do all their magic in front of you. Don't the look and feel of Zenshin discourage you. \n\n   Their HAPPY HOUR is amazing, such a great deal on cocktails and not-so-small-bites:\n\n- Strawberry Bangkok - $6\n\n- Rising Sun - $6\n\n- Beers & wine - $2-$3\n\n- Hamachi Kama - $6 Grilled Yellowtail Collar & Ponzu Sauce, the CHEAPEST in Las Vegas! Order it!\n\n- Teriyaki Beef Sliders or Soft Shell Crab Cake Sliders - $6\n\n- Karaage Chicken - $4.50\n\n    Now the regular menu:\n\n- Jalapeno Yellowtail - Hamachi, Jalapeno, Shiso, Tobiko & Truffle Ponzu - order this!\n\n- Sizzlin' Tuna - Sizzled with Grape Seed Oil, Ginger, Chives & Truffled Soy - delish\n\n- Teriyaki Beef - Marinated in Soy, Ginger, Garlic & Simply Grilled, simply falvorful.\n\n- Uni with caviar, toro, tai, hamachi were all fresh and high quality fish.\n\n- Cucumber roll with tuna, hamachi, salmon was so delicious, fresh, and it was my FAV roll, off-the-menu, but if request on a week day, chef will do it for you.\n\n    I have met many chefs via Instagram and Twitter, Chef Chris Ricaido is 1 of the most genuine chefs, he's humbled, kind, young and very cute too!  And I probably enjoy his company a lot more because he's from Hawaii where my half broski was born and raised, what not to love about him :-)\n\n   Service was very attentive, the price point is so CHEAP compare to everything on the main strip or San Francisco Bay Area. This is why I love to come to Vegas for food. TRUST ME, take a short cab drive to the South Point Hotel to check out Zenshin, it's a perfect sushi spot for a big group or for a family on budget. \n\n    Follow chef Chris Ricaido and you will see: www.Instagram\/C_REC
