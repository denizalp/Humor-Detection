I can not describe to you how terrible my experience with this place was. I was absolutely appalled. \n\nI came in as part of a group of six and the place was empty. The fellow working asked if we had reservations, and gave us attitude when he learned that we didn't. We apologized and were about to leave when he said it was okay and he'd find room... \n\nThe service was slow, he critiqued our menu selections and yelled at one of our group (who had a late lunch) for just ordering a salad. Its not like he needed to up-sell, we all were drinking as well. After being there for an hour, I asked our server if the food would be out soon, as we had an event to get to. A nearby table of two who were seated well after us got their meals a full 15 minutes before we did. \n\nThe food was adequate. A  bit saltier than it needed to be, but good. I would have probably enjoyed it if I weren't so bamboozled by the behavior of the fellow working there. We ate quickly.  \n\nWhen we asked for the bill, I indicated to the server that there something wrong on my bill and then tried to act like it was my fault. At this point I was a bit short with him. Not unkind, but losing patience. Let me preface what comes next by saying that I did leave a tip. After I'd settled and my friends were in the process of doing the same, I stepped outside to let others know we were done dinner. Once I was out of earshot, the server remarked to my friends that I was a bitch.The waitstaff called me a bitch. To my friends. \n\nWe left absolutely incredulous. Never again.
