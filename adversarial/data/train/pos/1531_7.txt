The beer selection is unbelievable. There is too many to count, unless you really like to count. Then, this is the place for you. We met some friends for a game, and they had no issue in seating the 10-12 of us. We grabbed some tall tables and all ordered a selection of beers to sample. It's a bit weird to think that this place is in a strip mall. It was a bit smaller than I thought it was going to be also. The servers were super fast in getting our orders, even though it was pretty busy for the Badger game. We had a couple of food orders at out table and the food seemed like average pub food. If you are unsure of where to start on the extensive beer list, ask your server or bartender. They will be able to whittle down the list for you. They also offer pre-selected samplers on the menu too.
