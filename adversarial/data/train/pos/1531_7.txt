Drai's was my first Vegas nightclub experience and I don't have anything bad to say. Though the location itself was smaller than expected, I've since learned that it's larger than other options. Check their social media for special events, guests, theme nights, or promotions. The production effects made for a fun night, as did table\/bottle service. The dance floor is fairly large and the dress code only seems to be loosely enforced, but I enjoyed the music, dancers, and lighting effects. Gather up your girl friends and contact a promoter for the best experience!
