Good Chips and Salsa and that is about it! Service was horrible, with a group looking to spend money, staff was not accommodating nor was the manager of this establishment.  I am not sure if he was in training, but he provided no reason for not being able to provide separate checks and looked dumbfounded when asked.  I am not sure he should be in the position of running a restaurant, perhaps a waiter position would suit him best.  \n\nVery disappointed with this restaurant given it is located in the Aria Hotel.
