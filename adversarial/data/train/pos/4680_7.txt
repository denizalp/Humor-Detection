Okay except for the long wait time (still?!) the place still lives up to it's quality even after about 2 years since opening. \n\nAfter thinking that I was going to the other location, I was little disappointed (only at first!) My last experience here was a little lacklustre, and full of too many fried foods. \n\nOur friend Patrick M. waited patiently for a table of 3 on a Saturday night (THANKS PAT!). Ordering was easy for me, as a veteran of these restos now. \nMy usual strategy, is to get my favourites, plus ones that will fill you up significantly. \n\nMy staples here are:\n - Pumpkin Croquette\n - Takoyaki\n - Beef Short Ribs\n - Kimchi Udon\n - BimBimbap (awesome the first time you have it, nothing special on subsequent tries)\n - some type of grilled fish (same price as most dishes, but big portion)\n - either Salmon Natto Yukke or Spicy BC Tuna version\n\nI usually try to stay away from the Sashimi, although very fresh, $8 for only a few pieces doesn't sit well with me.\n \nTheir specials change every month, and we were lucky it was Oct1st. Today they had NonKostu Karaage (deep fried chicken cartilage) It's my favourite, and not a lot of restaurants have this on their regular menus. It was divine. \n\nI was very happy with the service, as opposed to the Bloor location. Could be that the guy in t he area was very good. We never had to wait for him to flag him down bc he would already be around. And the food came awfully quickly (smart for them bc of the long line up outside). \n\nDessert wasn't as good as the Bloor location (no Sake Tiramisu). Instead we had a deep fried green ice cream, and baked\/mashed sweet potato (both off the specials menu). Nothing to call home about. \n\nOur meal for 3, including a big $20 bottle of sake was around $120. I'm not sure how in my first visit (and review) I spent only $20 a person.... I bet that with more people , the less you spend.\n\nP.S. if you want to sit outside (esp in this cold weather) there is no line up! haha
