'Tis the season to have pumpkin\nfa la la la laahhh, la la la lah\n\nEvery other restaurant that I order cheesecake from tastes much better to me than CF. The factory isn't putting out top quality. But... \n\nThis was my third swing at trying C Factory cakes. I thought it was going to strike out, but lo and behold I found a flavor that sets them apart. Homerun for the Dutch Apple Struessel. There's great layers and texture to the cake, and the apples are chunky. Flavors meld. \n\nAnd though pumpkin is in, the Dutch wins.\n\nI'll pass on the pumpkin and pumpkin\/pecan flavors next time. The pumpkin was bland and the pumpkin\/pecan was all wrong. Layers didn't blend. I had to bite the top layer. Then I had to bite the cheese. Then I had to bite through the pecans. Then I had to cut into the crust. Come on already.\n\nIt felt like my mouth was in training to get a job eating cheesecake. Which actually wouldn't be half bad...hmmmm...but it was too much work for a $7.95 slice.
