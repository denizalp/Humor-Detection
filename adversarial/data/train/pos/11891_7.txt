Updating a review - March 2017 - Back to 3 stars. Looks like all new staff, I didn't recognize anyone from before. Pretty lame customer service. I was interested in the new MacBook Pro and a stylist for my iPad Pro, but couldn't track down a decent sales person. \n\nUpdating Review- March 2016 -5 stars\nStaff working here currently are much improved. Last 3 shopping trips have been very pleasant. Nothing beats Apple products ( says a formally devoted Windows 7... but hates all Windows version since user. \n\nPrevious Review during the XMAS season - 3 Stars\nI love Apple products but I don't like the Apple employees I encountered at this location recently. The new hires are rude, abrupt, and clueless about customer serves. I was shocked to hear an Apple employee yell at a customer \"Not Now! I am busy!\" as the customer approached her with a question. Shockingly @ITCHY!\n\nI was in today to buy an iPad Pro...but after dealing with an arrogant and ignorant young male sales associate, I decided to call my hubby to buy my Apple products from Best Buy instead. The Apple associates working at Best Buy are usually so much nicer. Plus we got to use a Best Buy 10% off coupon on my Apple purchase. This used to be my fav Apple store...but no more. :( Maybe all the rude Staff will get Fired as soon as the Holiday Season is over. Finger Crossed. :)
