Used to be called East Ocean Dim Sum. Newly renovated, fresh coat of paint..that being said food is the same...over fried shrimp balls or maybe\nreheated..service takes a long time ..it took us 15 minutes to wait for our food..another 10 before the soda we ordered came..another 15 minutes for the take out box to come. Totally disorganized! Servers so unmindful of customers.\nDo not be fooled by the new look of this place..terrible!
