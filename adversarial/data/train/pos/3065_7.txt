Moving finally to the last of my supplementary snacks I'll start off by saying I'd read about The Fry Bread House a couple of times when planning my trip to The Valley but it did not make my list of must visit stops until just the day prior during dinner at Kai when I was speaking with head Chef Michael O'Dowd about the lack of Native American restaurants in the area (he explained this to me, but that is for another time) and one of his expeditors suggested I should check out Cecilia Miller's temple of fried dough calling it \"about as authentic as it gets around here.\"\n\nHailing from the Tohono O'odham Nation and serving up her style of Indian Tacos around the area for nearly twenty years (and now at two locations) I opted to head to the original Fry Bread House West and having followed my GPS from door to door I found the location with ease on a relatively dingy stretch of 7th Avenue and allocating parking with ease I made my way into the unassuming low-lying restaurant where I was greeted by a short line and then by a curt but friendly waitress who took no time in requesting my order and name before handing me a plastic cup to get my water and suggesting it would be perhaps 10 minutes before my food was ready.\n\nTaking a seat - the table slightly sticky and clearly not wiped down since (at least) the last diners - and browsing the scene while I watched the kitchen work through the small open window I marveled at the flow of the room as patron after patron received his or her food.  With some orders having been phoned in and others being delivered to the tables surrounding mine if I had to guess nearly fifteen Fry Breads were served during my nine minute wait and when I finally heard \"Michael\" called from the front I stepped up to collect my $12 merely seconds before the next order was served up to \"Andre.\"\n\nReturning to my seat with prizes in hand my first impression was that I'd over ordered as each disc was easily the size of a Frisbee and two-to-three fold as thick, but picking up my first option, the \"Indian Taco with Pinto Beans, Shredded Cheddar Cheese, Lettuce\" I was next impressed as to just how light the hand stretched bread was - a wisp of pillowy flat bread crisped on the outside by the oil but light and airy within.  With the ingredients a standard store-bought admixture of traditional taco toppings and a bit of hot sauce to taste this was a good choice to understand what the \"Indian Taco\" was all about (and perhaps to understand why diabetes and lipid disorders are so prevalent in their population, as well.)\n\nMoving next to my dessert selection, one of the frequently noted \"best dishes\" in Phoenix and denoted as an \"Award Winning Favorite\" on the restaurant menu, the Chocolate and Butter Fry Bread would prove to be every bit the \"Fair Food\" extravagance I expected with the same airy dough this time served openfaced and drizzled - nay - ladled first with butter and then with melted dark chocolate tinged with what I believe was adobe spice and cinnamon.  Sliced and resting atop both wax paper and napkins to soak up the grease I attacked this fry bread with zeal and without going so far as to call it the most sinful thing I've eaten this year I will simply say this; it was a once-in-a-year sort of treat that was entirely worth the money, calories, and visit but at the same time the sort of thing that simply feels \"bad\" for you despite the smile on your face as you're eating it.
