So junky and cluttered! Prices aren't good either! I walked in and left after a few minutes. I love to shop but the disorganization was a little too much for me. Some of the items like the steamers were missing critical pieces and appeared to be used. \n\n\nJust skip this place and go to the Goodwill a few stores down. \n\nNext!
