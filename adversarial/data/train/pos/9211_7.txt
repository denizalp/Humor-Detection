Warning: DO NOT LIVE HERE! Brown water, building wide water shut offs EVERY month, broken gates & elevators, no place to walk your dog, homeless people sleeping on the premises, valet full on the weekends, dirty floors in the entry and elevators, pool cabanas not available for use, confusing policy on visitors... I can go on & on.  We are counting down the days until we move out. Thank goodness we did not buy here.
