The food is good, the service is ok, the communication is terrible.  a few days ago was the 3 or 4th time i have come to this food truck on the side of the Jackrabbit Rd. just south of the I-10 freeway.  and each time I place an order they get it wrong. Its not that I get the wrong food item, but they make it the way they want and leave on items I have request not to have and dont add the items i requested to be added.  One may ask, then do I come back, and I say only because when I am working in the area, they are the only food place for miles. \n\nWill i come back probably not, could i give a recommendation to this place no.\n\nI do feel if you speak Spanish you will have better luck communicating with them overall.
