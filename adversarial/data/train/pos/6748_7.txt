What can you say? This is a seriously huge, seriously gorgeous, seriously well staffed comic book store. I hate doing the whole \"compared to big cities\" thing to stuff in ze CLT but seriously... any sized metropolis would be lucky to call Heroes its own.\n\nOn top of running this awesome place, the dudes organize the yearly ComicCon, which, like Heroes, is huge, awesome, and popular. And relatively inexpensive. And surprisingly well attended by comic (both indie and non-indie) artists and fans. \n\nI love you Heroes.
