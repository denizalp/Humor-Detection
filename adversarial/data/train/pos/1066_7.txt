Went to 5Church with a buddy after a 5K one evening.  As this was my first time there, I was unsure what to expect.  I had heard lots about this new, jumping, spot Uptown, but the descriptions were always a bit vague as to why exactly it was so good...\n....well allow me, if I may, to go into some detail about what exactly makes 5Church pop...\n\n...First, the service;  its top notch.  Our server was extremely pleasant and polite and she was very understanding of the fact that we were with a hodgepodge group of friends and that people were ordering food and drinks at all different times.  Yet and still, she was on-point with the service and she was very accurate with the checks at the end of the night as well - no problems splitting the check.  She was quick to refill drinks or to ask if we needed more adult beverages, which of course we always did.\n\nSecond, the food.  The food was excellent.  We split the \"Bacon Pizza\" as an appetizer.  It tasted very fresh, and made to order.  It was thin slice\/flat bread, which I am not normally a fan of, but the bacon really made the pie explode in my mouth (That's what she said, LOL).  For my main course, I ordered the Grilled Hanger Steak.  The words savory and exquisite come to mind when I think about the Hanger Steak  It was cooked perfectly, and had a wonderful grilled, smokey flavor to it.  \n\nThird, the uniqueness.  Though they had plenty of tables, my buddy and I sat on leather couches with the rest of our friends and had a very enjoyable dinner.  I have never been to an establishment that married the lounge\/tapas vibe with that classy, restaurant taste, and service, as well as 5Church.  \n\nI would definitely recommend this place if you are looking for something different, and a little hipper than you standard, upscale steakhouse.
