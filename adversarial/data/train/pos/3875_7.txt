My review is based on my first experience at Atomic which was last night. I get real excited when I find new bars on Yelp, like really excited that I hype myself up. \n\nWhen I first arrived, parking lot was full but there was more room in the back which was convenient. & it was FREE parking, thats hard to come around downtown. I would suggest parking here & maneuver your way down freemont street with a buddy system of course because this place is just too far East on freemont!\n\nThe cocktails were Delish. I decided on the Smoked Watermelon which was not on the menu but fellow Yelpers raved about it. It had a smoked after taste. My friends got the Strawberry Fields which was on the sour side but still kinda good. The beers they have on tap were impressing. Bartenders were kinda hard to get a hold of, even in the beginning when it wasn't too busy. \n\nThe atmosphere was out of the ordinary last night. Lots of people in crazy costumes, roller blades, & bikes. I felt like I was at an Electric Carnival. Although it was kinda on the funnier side we had to get out of there as soon as possible with all the commotion it had started.
