EWWW this place is ratchet. Plz, take my advice, and don't let the nice aesthetics deceive you! The margarita I had here tasted like bath water mixed with Clorox. They even served it to me in a red Solo cup-- I am not sure why because other people got normal glasses. Good vibes here b\/c of the outdoor patio, but the service was sh*t (granted, I only went once) and the alcohol was actually AWFUL. Please, if you want a decent drink go ANYWHERE ELSE. If you want a great drink, all you have to do is cross the street and go to RnR...
