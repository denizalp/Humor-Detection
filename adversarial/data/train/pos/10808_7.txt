Best service of any Vietnamese restaurant we've been to! We never have to ask to have our water refilled, at some other joints we literally have to wave a flag to get service. We've tried the garlic chicken wings, egg rolls, beef stew, pho, bun bo hue, vermicelli bowls.  Everything has been really tasty, the exceptional item is the beef stew.  The broth is thick and hearty, and the brisket is tasty and tender.  The bun bo hue is just okay, lacks the depth of flavor of some of the other places.  We like this place since it's usually not too busy and it's closer than Chinatown!
