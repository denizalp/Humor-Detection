I went for dinner buffet and the food was disgusting! My husband and I had severe rounds of loose motions that night and the next day.\nWe wanted to try a bit of everything, but the food looked unappetizing. I decided to try the stuff that at least looked better - so went for noodles, chickpea salad, chicken curry and spicy rice, along with mango lassi.\nIt was all just weird tasting. \nOverall very very bad experience.
