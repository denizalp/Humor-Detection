I have been to many Korean BBQ dining experiences (AZ, CA, and in Hong Kong).  I found their whole concept confusing (read on).  We waited about 20 minutes and was greeted by the host. We sat in the grilling section. The table was already set up with side dishes & salad. It came with a free steamed egg. \n\nWe started eating sides then server came by.  Apparently, the grill seating section required 2 meat orders or combo with no exception (no where did I see that and we were not informed).  My friend didn't want to eat meat.  Then we were told there is a non-grilled seating section option. The server indicated that the host should have asked us.  We don't recall the host mentioning anything at all. Absolutely confusing! \n\nFinally, the server allowed us just order one meat selection.  Normally, the server just cut the meat and not grills the meat for you.  The server was standing around grilling it, I see why the high prices.  I rather grill it myself, that is the true Korean BBQ experience. The constant interruption with the server grilling the meat was annoying. Can't really have a conversation.
