Meh. It's a pub in its purest form. I am not a beer drinker so my review is from non-drinker's point of view. I'm reviewing food and service. \n\nThe staff that helped us only checked on us twice. I was thirsty and dying from the curry spices. It was spicy hot. Again, sorry was very very poor. If they don't see $$ on our forehead, they will forsake you. Like that word -forsake? \n\nMoving on... \n\nThe food was OK. Poor service + ok food = two stars. I could have given a higher rating if it was delish. But it's not delish (borrowing term from a friend). \n\nBecause of poor service and OK food... I will not come back.
