Shhh... Don't tell anyone else, but this place has amazing Greek food! I've avoided writing a review simply because I didn't want my favorite hole-in-the-wall to get jammed up with other fans. I was nervous about the change of ownership a while back, but aside from minor tweaks, they've just added some friendly faces. I've had everything on their menu with the exception of a couple of spicy dishes. I'm not going into too many details because you'll have to try it for yourself.
