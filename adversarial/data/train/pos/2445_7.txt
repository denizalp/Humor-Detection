I like this place. I workout here and they have a fairly comprehensive women's section with TVs that is usually pretty empty - even in January. \n\nIt's clean, quiet and spacious and they just put up some awesome full wall decals that bring a surprising energy to the place (or is that the endorphins that do that?) \n\nI like the classes here a lot. They're included in your membership and really good value for your money. They give you the option of trying out different sorts of things without having to commit to it!
