Came in to get a tattoo after reading all the positive reviews and seeing all the really good art work done on other people. Explained what I wanted to Coob, which was 3 rupees, that we put on my upper thigh. We were there almost 3 and a half hours and left with a poorly done tattoo that was over priced for the quality and time spent on it. Poor line work and the color splotches and has no depth.
