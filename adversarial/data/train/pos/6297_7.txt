My rating is 3.5 stars.\n\nI first visited this Chatime back in 2016. I had just finished watching a movie at the Cineplex VIP Theatre and wanted a drink. I decided to give Chatime a try. It had recently opened in downtown Markham when I had dropped by.\n\nThere were a few people ahead of me. Since I am borderline lactose-intolerant, I looked for a beverage that did not have any dairy. I got a large coconut slush, which suited my needs.\n\nI love coconut. This slush drink was decent. I could have used less sugar. Lesson learned!\n\nIt's nice to treat yourself to a drink here after a movie. It has become my little ritual as I drive home enjoying it. I wouldn't come here just to get a drink, though.\n\n(342)
