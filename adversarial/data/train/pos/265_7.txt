Grand Lux is Cheesecake Factory 2.0.\n\nThey have an extensive menu just like the Cheesecake factory, but I would say that Grand Lux has better options that are tastier and healthier.\n\nThe avocado chipotle burger was massive and delicious. I had to eat with with a knife and fork since it didn't fit in my mouth. The waiter was very nice and allowed me to substitute the side of fries with the chicken and mushroom soup. The soup was perfectly creamy, not too overwhelming.\n\nThey have a late night menu from 12am-6pm which means that they are open 24 hours a day! After a long night of drinking, you can stop by the Grand Lux for some late night munchies! \n\nMy friends and I came here twice during our trip to Vegas because the prices are great and the portions are big. Many restaurants on The Strip are overpriced, but the Grand Lux keeps it real!
