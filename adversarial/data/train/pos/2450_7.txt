I have lived here when I first came to Phoenix, I didn't know anyone and the staff are awesome. I have only great things to say about this complex. Never had an issue. I use to forget my keys to my car and my apartment left hanging in the door and always was amazed in the morning that they were still there.  The location was awesome and very convenient to shops, restaurants and grocery stores as well as the movies.  My location was perfect for me  since I worked so close to my apartment. I hope to be back soon and I would love to reside here again. I don't know where you guys get your pics from but I have never had a bad experience at Deer Creek Village.
