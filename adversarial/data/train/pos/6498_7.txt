I must admit, I like The Hives, the Swedish neo-punk band, they have catchy tunes. I don't however like hives you receive from an allergic reaction from sushi. \n\nYes, it is true, Ra tried to kill me. I went to this Ra, not following my mantra ABRA (anything but Ra) and met my parents for dinner. For some unknown reason they love Ra. I figured , what the hell, it's their favorite place so I'll just roll with it. (or sashimi with it) The food was fine for Ra standards, all I had was my  normal assorted sashimi plate with a side bowl of rice. Keep in mind I eat sushi almost every week, and sometimes twice a week. Only once before did I get a little sick from sushi, if I remember correctly, I didn't touch the stuff for like 6 months :( \n\nWhen you get some sort of \"food poisoning\" you really try to figure out what the hell went wrong that day. As I awoke Sunday a bit itchy, I noticed some small red spots appearing and disappearing. Throughout the day I realized, I was have an allergic reaction to \"something\" I have NO allergies, so this is new for me. \n\nAs I thought back, I had to blame the sushi, it was the only unique thing I had all day. I kept wondering, what fish was to blame? The tuna, octopus, white fish, salmon? I think the culprit was either the white fish or octopus, I eat neither that often. \n\nI have to say, having the \"hives\" isn't as much fun as listening to The Hives. \n\nI hate Ra, so much more now. ..HATE HATE HATE it. I mean, once you are poisoned by a place, it looses it's luster.   Yes, eating Sushi is a risk, but I have been an avid sushi fan for about 6 years now, and never really had this type of problem before. \n\nEither way, benadryl works wonders with hives. I am no Elephant Man, but the redness, and itching does make you feel a bit uncomfortable, and also conscience of your appearance.  I just wonder if I'll be off sushi for a while.....
