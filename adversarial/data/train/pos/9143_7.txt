There are several stores in Vegas that sell stones, gems and crystals. All of them are unique in their own way and sell their own variety in their own manner. Kalifano in the Venetian, sells their specialty items in a neat and orderly manner with smaller items individually packaged.\n\nI came into Kalifano to purchase big blocks of black tourmaline for an out of state friend. I was able to purchase two big blocks for around $50 which is hard to find here in Vegas for that price. Also I like to purchase such items in a store with a good vibe although many people come through and touch the stones, that can be easily remedied by cleaning them.\n\nI have been purchasing gems, crystals and such for quite sometime and this store is pretty solid and well marketed. The prices are fair, the store is well organized and the people who work there are very helpful.\n\nGreat store in Vegas for your gem needs!
