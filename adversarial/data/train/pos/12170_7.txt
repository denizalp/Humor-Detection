Glenda is pleasant and gracious and is incredibly precise with her work. I had two soak off gel manicures with her, and the first one lasted 3 weeks without a chip. The second was just yesterday, but I'm confident it will be just as lasting. \n\nShe has a great selection of colors and high quality product lines. \n\nI found her through Groupon and while I appreciated the great deal, I will definitely use her again. Her regular prices are quite reasonable. \n\nIf you are looking for a nail artist inside Salon Boutique, trust me when I say that Glenda is a fantastic choice. Don't settle for poor service, bad attitude, or a technician that treats you like dirt. Glenda will take pleasure in doing your nails and they will be beautiful!
