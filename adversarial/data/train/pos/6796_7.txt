Hungover on a Sunday afternoon? Need a great and cheap breakfast to start your day? That's right, you've come to the right place. \n\nHere you get your dollars worth for your breakfast. I think I paid about $6 for Jacks breakfast special. 3 eggs scrambled, 2 slices of bacon, 2 sausages and home fries w\/ toast. The portions are huge\n\nThat breakfast hit the spot, in my tummy that is;) I couldn't even finish it. This food has the guarantee hangover food stamp on it. I'll definitely be back to try their pancakes! On my list!
