Sea Witch is the first chippy I've found in the GTA that does authentic chips.  The chips are cut properly and fried perfectly 10\/10.  The fish is equally as impressive. My partner and I ordered the halibut and haddock.  Both were generously cut, battered and fried just right.  The halibut was very fresh and meaty and the batter was nicely seasoned.  We wanted to try the onion rings but were told they are off the menu during busy times on the weekend.  Portion sizes are huge...one order of chips can easily be split between two diners.
