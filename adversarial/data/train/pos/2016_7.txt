PROS:\n+ I love that they offer authentic dishes like the eggplant badjeman and mantu meat dumplings, which may arguably be their best offerings.\n+ They use Halal meats and don't freeze or microwave, which is awesome. Most dishes are distinctly fresh.\n+ Speaking of fresh, load up on their freshly made Persian taftoon bread. I can't get enough.\n+ Portion sizes are generous, pricing is fair, and I like that I can order online through the Yelp app for fast and easy pickup.\n\nCONS:\n- Kabobs have been hit or miss, upgrade to the tenderloin style unless you prefer the ground meat kabobs which have been on the dry side.\n- Dips also seem hit or miss? The eggplant baba ghanouj has been great but the hummus is lacking, on the bland side. \n- It's a minor issue but the cafeteria style warming trays behind the counter are overfilled with takeout boxes, straws, drink lids, etc and is messy and unappealing.
