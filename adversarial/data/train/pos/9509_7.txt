I've been to Cafe Zupas a couple of times.  Living in Mesa (also known as South Utah), Zupas gets all kinds of hype - there was a ton of excitement about this place opening.\n\nSo I went.\n\nSo, does this place live up to hype?  Absolutely not.  The only thing I can say about why it is so popular around here, is, \"it must be a Utah thing.\"  It's part of their cultural identity... But their cultural identity is play-it-safe, don't-do-anything-too-different, and bland.\n\nThe food here is fine.  The soup is fine.  The sandwiches are a little mediocre.  The drink bar is fine.  But the soup is not to die for.  The drink bar is not to die for.  The whole place is an exercise in being slightly better than average.  Zupas is to Subway what In-N-Out Burger is to McDonald's.\n\nI don't even remember which sandwiches and soups I've tried.  I know I've had a mushroom-based soup that was decent...  They just weren't that memorable.
