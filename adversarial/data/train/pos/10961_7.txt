Very iffy on how I feel about this place as of yet, I do think I will pay it another visit.\n\nThey have a pretty great beer selection, along with some kept on tap that they rotate out every once in awhile, which is a big plus for me. The irish cider is a kicker.\n\nThe service is friendly and great, all the bartenders I've encountered on my few visits there were amazing.\n\nThe food though. The food is terrible here. I partly blame myself for ordering tacos in an English bar (they were on happy hour!) but that's not the only thing that was disappointing. The shepherds pie was absolutely terrible. It's mashed potatoes and meat, so I don't know how you mess that up, but they did.\n\nI don't know if I'll brave another food order here, but if I ever want to come back to just drink, it'll possibly be a go-to.
