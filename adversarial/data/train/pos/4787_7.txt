Would not recommend!! Left my Toyota Tundra to get brakes fixed but after picking up the truck noticed they put the brakes on wrong. Went back to get it fixed and made up a story about how a part broke while fixing it. They ended up charging us for them not properly repairing the car in the first place! Been to this place before and always see people in the lobby complaining and arguing with the manger. Dishonest and just tying to see where they can make a quick buck.
