Im seriously contemplating contacting the better business bureau.  This place is as unethical as they come.  My car only has about 20k miles, the mechanic claimed I need about $1500 worth of repairs when I brough it in for an oil change.  I declined, thinking I needed a second opinion.  I picked up my car, as I was driving away my car begins to rattle.  I drive back informing them my car was just fine when I dropped it off earlier in the day.  Turns out, the mechanic failed to tighten something (a cover?) in my car.  Really?  Anyways, drove off a second time and the same thing happened.  I had to wait for another 30 minutes for them to fix the rattle they caused.  Needless to say I am pissed, a routine oil change turned into an all day affair.  I get a survey in my email, I filled it out.  Within hours the service manager calls me, I explained my situation and how I dissatisfied with the dealership.  Here is what is funny, as I am talking to him he begins to have another conversation with someone else, YES, I am trying to explain my situation and he is having a full conversation with someone in his office. He had no intentions of making the situation right or even listening for that matter.  STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE!\n\nFast forward a month later, I find a reputable repair shop on YELP, they do an inspection and tell me my car is fine.  The repairs that Infinity claimed I needed was not neccessary.
