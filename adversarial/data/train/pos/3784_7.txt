Way up yonder in ye cold north, there aren't too many independent bean pushers. Everywhere one looks it's green signs and six dollar frappuccinos. \n\nEnter Mad Bean. A small and cheerful coffee shop with free wifi and bagels. The price point is low, the people quality is high, and the ambiance is what you'd expect if you were at a similar location south of Bloor. \n\nI had a green tea, but the man running the joint takes a lot of pride in their americanos, so if coffee is your thing be sure to try one. \n\nPEPPER TAKES PAUSE: They have really fun posters in the bathroom. You will stay in there too long.
