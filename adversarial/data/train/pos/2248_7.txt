This place would have received a 5 star if it wasn't for the rude incompetent employee who we discussed upgrading to a membership to.  It's $150.00 annually to come unlimited amount of times. My wife bought the membership, then 5 mins later changed her mind so she went to cancel it immediately. She was told that the member ship is non-cancelable and she couldn't get her money back. She explained she had JUST gotten it and was rudely given a blank copy of the sheet she completed with her personal info to mail the membership card to. At the bottom were tony letters that read \"memberships cannot be cancelled\". This was never explained to her, she was just told  to complete the form. My wife was very upset and disgusted by the employees at the front desk. She won't be back and is calling our credit card to dispute the charge. \n\nBesides that, we had some fun with our toddler. We got through the entire building (3 floors) in 1 1\/2hrs. I don't think we will be back.
