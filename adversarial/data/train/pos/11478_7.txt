After receiving the worst haircut of my life at a dum dum salon in Canton, I randomly googled salons in Cleveland and came across Danny's Salon.  I read the bios of the top stylists and decided that these folks were on par talent-wise with some stylists I used to go to in San Francisco.  I called and spoke to the receptionist and told her I wanted someone who was a master stylist who is well-versed at point cutting.  She immediately recommended Theresa.  She said Theresa is a salon educator and she's been cutting hair for 15 years.  I wanted to be relieved but until you physically get to a salon and talk to the stylist, it's really a crap shoot in my humble opinion.  I arrived at the salon and it's really nothing fancy.  It's located in the first floor of an office building.  It's a Paul Mitchell salon, and I cannot remember the last time I was ever in a Paul Mitchell salon...anyway...Theresa greeted me and we went to her station.  I told her my nightmare story and reluctantly took my hair out of my ponytail to show her how bad of a cut it was...I showed her a few pictures and away we went.  I instantly felt comfortable with her and her knowledge of hair texture and styles.  Whew...long story short...we had a great conversation and she gave me a terrific and technically perfect haircut that exactly mirrored the picture I showed her.  She is meticulous about checking her angles, and I love that in a stylist.  It shows their professional training and desire to do a good job.  I wanted to jump out of the chair and hug her!  I will definitely go back to her.  A haircut with her costs $52.
