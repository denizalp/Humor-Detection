What a disappointment! I was excited to try this place, came here for my first birthday dinner. Nothing was really good, in fact some dishes were horrible! \n\nI love bone marrow! And here has ruined it for me, my bone marrow was undercooked! I felt like I was eating fat! The best thing was the beef carpaccio. Beef tartare was not bad either. So basically anything that was good did not require any \"cooking\"! \n\nDid I mention? The beef Wellington was so bad! Skin was not crispy at all, meat was undercooked. (I was so disappointed) \n\nThe steak was so so, fried mushroom was terrible! \n\nThe best thing was the service! Waiters were nice. And our chocolate cake was delicious!  \n\nCome here with low expectations...
