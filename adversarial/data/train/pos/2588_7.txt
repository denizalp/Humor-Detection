Barely had any issues after they fixed our leaking bathroom sink and sagging ceiling from the air conditioner. That is if you dont count the flooding washing machine where we had to replace a section of the carpet multiple times, or the shotty windows where we've had to use duct tape in order to not make our home look like something out of Jumanji (RIP Robin Williams) or The Amazon Rainforest . The maintenance crew here is very thorough, making sure you call at least 3 times before doing anything.  So all in all they can FUCK ME IN THE ASS with their high prices and poor maintenance.....
