2.5 Star\n\nThis review is based on drinks only as we didn't order food at Sgt Peppers.\n\nSgt Peppers feels like family owned as this place is really short of wait staff. Quite a few tables were not cleared when I dropped by around 10:30 pm in the evening to catch the last period of NHL game.\n\nBeer on draft is decent and priced well. We ended up ordering Mill Street Organic Ale and Keith's Galaxy Hop. \n\nStaff starting to clean the tables around us using cleaner which I am really allergic to the smell.....\n\nTVs though plenty were small and not high definition.. but at least I can watch the game no matter where I sit.
