I came back to YC's this past Saturday night and it seemed like the employees were really staying on top of keeping the buffet line organized and clean as well as the dining area.  However, the people there were being careless and letting the part of the tongs that their hands touched fall back into the food! C'mon people, that's gross!  I think YC's should develop a way to reduce the transfer of germs to food - like maybe installing hooks where the tongs can be hung so they are not thrown back into the food?  Also maybe a hand sanitizer station before entering the buffet line?  Just throwing ideas out there!  Overall, a good healthy dining experience.
