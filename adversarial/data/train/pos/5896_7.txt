Mediocre food,  the red sauce on my gnocchi was basically chunks of watery tomatoes.  The dish was lukewarm at best.   My husband had the eggplant which was also so-so.  I guess we might be a bit prejudice when it comes to Italian food since we lived in Italy for three years and became spoiled.\n\nThe waitress was wonderful and charming, but there was a very boisterous accordion player that would NOT leave us alone.   He stayed between our table and another for over an hour.   Therefore conversation with our guests was nearly impossible to hear.  The best part about him is when he stopped and took a break!\n\nThis was our second time here, andI don't think we will be going again.
