I haven't tried the Friday-Saturday dinner version of this place yet, but I've been there twice: one for the Sunday Champagne Brunch & the other for the \"Holiday\" Dinner.\n\nIn both experiences, myriad amounts of their delicacies, with few of their gourmet kinds, are at high quality & at great taste.  My favorite ones would have to be Beef Wellington, Rack of Lamb, gelato, Key Lime pie, & surprisingly Foie Gras (thank God I tried it here rather than risking moola on some fancy sit-down restaurant), because I think these were the tastiest of everything I've tried.\n\nHowever, the holiday version was disappointing because my BF and I went there for Friday dinner in December, & it was a bit overpriced for less quantities of the foods served & no \"exotic\" foods were present there =(.  Plus, it was $5 more than the actual price for the Friday & Saturday dinner.  I would've rated 3 stars instead of 4, but I'm too lazy separating these 2 experiences from one another x).\n\nRegardless, I wanna go there again for that Friday-Saturday dinner & hopefully the stuff I'm dying to try that didn't show up during the holiday will be worth their three dollar signs =).
