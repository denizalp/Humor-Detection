I'm a loyal Kimpton fan. If I'm traveling to another city, I immediately check to see if they have a hotel there. \n\nMy first trip to Pittsburgh and the Hotel Monaco was the perfect place to call home for the weekend. For starters, at check in the staff couldn't have been any nicer. Since I missed the wine happy hour, he even went to pour me a glass of wine to take with me to my room. \n\nKimpton's are always so fun and chic. I loved the birdcage light next to my bed. Convenient phone charging outlets next to the bed. Plenty of counter space in the bathroom. \n\nAmenities:\n*Evening wine hour\n*free WiFi for IHG Rewards Club members\n*$10 bar credit for IHG Rewards Club members\n*Luxury toiletries \n*Fitness center\n*Pet friendly (although this backfired on me as the room next to me had a yappy dog that barked for hours every night)\n\nI didn't have a chance to check out The Commoner or Biergarten (just didn't have time because it was a short trip. Convenient location in downtown. So many fun restaurants and bars nearby. This will be my go-to hotel when I visit Pittsburgh. \n\nNote: it's about a $33 Uber ride to the airport from here.
