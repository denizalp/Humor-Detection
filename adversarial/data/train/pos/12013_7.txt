Although I have only eaten at Patsy Grimaldi's one time and it was good, my review is about the bartender and their overall service.\n\nI came in to the restaurant on Saturday afternoon after spending most of the day at the Culinary Festival.  For some reason, we had a craving for pizza after eating a slice from Spinatti's at the festival.  Seemed like a good idea at the time.\n\nWhen we came in to Grimaldi's, we were informed of a 20 minute wait for a table and instead decided to grab the four available seats at the bar.  We were in a good mood and definately had a few drinks during the festival and were enjoying the time with some friends.  The bartender seemed to be in a sour mood (maybe from people before us) and immediately said \"I am not serving you any drinks\" before we even asked for anything.  He then proceeded to accuse us of being obnoxious and loud and walked away without even asking for our order.\n\nI found this one of the worst experiences of my entire life in a restaurant and will never step foot into Grimaldi's again.  We filed a complaint with the manager and went on our way to Malee's where they were happy to serve us food and drinks and had a much better time.\n\nPatsy Grimaldi's should do a much better job in training their staff in courtesy and customer service.
