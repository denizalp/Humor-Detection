Sip is my go-to coffee shop... \nI don't know how I haven't yet written a review for this awesome locally owned gem.  \n\nThis place is hopping morning, mid-day, and night, but it's never been too packed that I couldn't find a seat to meet with a friend, chat with my husband, interview a job candidate, listen to (live on occasion) music, or just zone out and work while taking advantage of their free wi-fi.  Service is always friendly and laid back, which I love.\n\nWhether you want a (Cartel) coffee straight up, a fancier espresso drink or cold brew, your choice of 20ish beers on tap, a cocktail, wine, iced tea, etc... there is something for you on Sip's beverage menu!  There is a decent food menu as well, which includes a few breakfast items, appetizers, salads, and sandwiches.  \n\nSip's Happy Hour is every day from 4pm - 7pm, during which time, they offer:\n-$1 off all draft wine\n-$1 off all draft beer\n-$6 whisky mules\n-$5 bruschetta\n-$5 hummus\n\nSip is opening a second location on Indian School and 36th St at the end of this month... I can't wait to check it out!
