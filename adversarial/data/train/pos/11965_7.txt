WHAT TO TRY?!\n\nTheir sake bombs. It's a popular drink here! For $5 you get a shot of sake in a cup of beer. But not only that, you get to experience the fun part of having the whole restaurant get all revved up as you take this same bomb challenge. A waiter will yell sake and you yell bomb. After three instances of shouting back and forth, you rumble the table to have the sake shot drop into your beer before downing it in one go. Quite fun!\n\nTheir tapas style dishes are great too. I recommend the sashimi dishes here and the takoyaki too. You can see in my pictures what I had and I loved all the dishes I ordered! \n\nThe ambiance in this restaurant has always been loud and lively so if you're not up for that, this restaurant may not be the best choice for you. Many come here for a birthday celebration or celebrating something because the bigger your group, the more it is when you do a sake bomb. \n\nThe only thing I want to warn you is about the pace of the service. Because they are so busy, sometimes it will take a bit longer for them to get the food to you or they simply forgot about your beer order. So be patient and be prepared to follow up with a waiter on your order!!\n\nLAST TIP?!\n\nThe bill can quickly add up because you want to try everything but a good rule of thumb is to order two dishes per person to start and then order more as you go along your meal! Enjoy the izakaya!!
