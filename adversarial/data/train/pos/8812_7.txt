We decided to go to Luna's Pizza on Halloween with my girlfriend. We decided to get the 22.99 deal, a Large Pizza with 20 wings. We made our order and decided to get 3 toppings.  When we paid we the total was over $30. The special displayed on the window did not specify anything about it only being one topping. The person taking our order did not have the courtesy or telling us the deal only applies a one topping pizza. I haven't even tasted their food, but customers service is what matters most. I'm just saying,  if we're expecting to get the special for $22.99, they should tell us while we're adding toppings that the special only applies to one topping.
