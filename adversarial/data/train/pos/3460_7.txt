Costco: The Crossfit of shopping experiences. Once you join, you never get out. Blood in blood out. The Costco cult must be stronger on the east side because the lines here are longer than Avon location. I lost my membership card while drinking recently. I had my picture taken. In my first ID photo I threw up the west side hand sign. That was at Avon location. Since I was on the east side, I wouldn't dare do the same on this photo. I just looked menacingly into the camera. The nerd at the counter wanted me to smile. I would not. I said I am a thug. He disputed that. That is not how to win over customers. Customer is always right even when they are idiotic.
