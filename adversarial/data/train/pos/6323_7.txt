One of my favorite neighborhood casinos, this place rocks because....\n\n- There are other things besides gambling here.  Movie theaters, bowling alley, and food!\n\n- Easy access parking.  The parking garage and the surface lot are very convenient and easy to get in\/out.  There's always plenty of parking too, even during special events.\n\n- Intuitive floor design.  It is always easy to find people and places in the casino.  It's not like a lot of the Vegas casinos where you don't know where the hell you are!\n\n- Great gambling selection.  Although I no longer gamble, I tell all of my friends who do to play here.  They have loose machines and low limit table games....something for everyone.\n\n- Decent rooms.  I've only stayed in a 2 bedroom suite here.  It surprised me as it was very elegant and was similar to a few hotels I've stayed at on the Strip.  Gorgeous view of the Las Vegas Valley if you have an East facing room.  Not what I would expect from a locals casino.\n\nOverall, it's good times here.  Definitely worth checking out if you're in the neighborhood.\n\nWill I return?  No doubt.
