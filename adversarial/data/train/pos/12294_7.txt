Their hours on Yelp say they are open until 9:30pm. I get to the restaurant at 8:15pm. All the lights are off. Their door says, \"Open daily at 10:00am\". But no closing hours. They have no website, so I call their phone number; I get an answering machine with a guy (who sounds really sad) saying that they're probably helping other customers. Nope. What's going on?
