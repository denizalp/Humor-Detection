Nice family owned establishment with a pan-Mediterranean menu.  Had the fpuzza with fig, pear, prosciutto and Gorgonzola.  Tasty, although a bit heavy on the rosemary.  Very enthusiastic owner who takes care of the front of the house.  Don't be dissuaded by the strip mall location.  Misters on the patio.
