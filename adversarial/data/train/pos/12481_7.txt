This place is a complete waste of time unless you enjoy beginner 'sushi' and like the ambiance of what I imagine the Sandals, Jamaica buffet to feel like.  Their sushi rolls are tiny, amateurish, and uninventive.  Edemame is unnecessarily seasoned with oils and sprinkles to rouse the uninitiated palate.  This is the poor man's version of Sting Ray in the tempered version of Scottsdale; Ahwatukee.  Their bar has a potentially interesting setup that looks outward onto Warner, but then again, the views affords a sweet look at Goodyear, Big O Tires, Jiffy Lube, and the several Chrysler Sebrings that the upper-working-class of the Tuke plant in the Tanked Fish's asphalt lot.
