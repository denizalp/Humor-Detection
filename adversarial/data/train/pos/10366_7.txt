Do not go here.  Dr molin and his staff run the most inefficient medical operation I have ever seen.  They do not put their patients first.  There is a constant stream of medical reps going in and out of the office while the waiting room is packed with patients waiting to be seen.  Their horrible scheduling practices will mean you will waste 60-90 minutes just waiting just to be called back.
