With all the awesomely themed hotels located in LV it's great to think that someone can still come up with something (fairly recently) that stands out as a unique and entertaining icon...\n\nWatching this simple yet enjoyable fountain show while listening to \"Time to Say Goodbye\" played over the loud speakers really helps add to the Vegas experience and serves to help solidify that you've arrived!\n\nThe Bellagio offers this great fountain show during the daylight, but also when it is dark at night time, but I find it more enjoyable at night when the lights of the fountains serve as a way to enhance the experience.\n\nStrategically placed fountains in a large man made lake shoot fountains of water high into the air and through the magic of computers and imagination the synched fountains seem to dance along with the music played. Sheer beauty ensues!\n\nNot a whole lot is free in Vegas (understandable,) but this one is totally free and so worth checking out!
