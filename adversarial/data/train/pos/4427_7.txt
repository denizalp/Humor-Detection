WINNER! WINNER! CHICKEN (STRIPS) DINNER!\n\nLooks like Raising Cane's just might have some competition! When you think of chicken strips, what comes to mind is deep fried battered chicken strips. Traditionally, that's what has always been known. \n\nBut then this place turns it up a notch, actually two notches, not just by offering you FRIED, but also GRILLED and BAKED as well. \n\nIt's not just your typical battered fried, but they use PANKO breading, which makes it very crispy on the outside while it stays juicy on the inside. \n\nAt first I thought the GRILLED would be kind of dry, but with the first bite, I was pleasantly suprised at how tender and juicy it was with the taste of Asian marinade and honey.\n\nSame goes for the BAKED. It has a wonderful rotisserie flavor to it.\n\nAs for the sides, you have BAKED MAC N CHEESE, FRENCH FRIES, and GRILLED VEGGIES. You can't go wrong with these selections but make sure at least one of your choices is the baked mac n cheese. Not only is it what you expect, but they also put MOZZARELLA on top of it!\n\nOf course you gotta have a sauce to dip you chicken strips in so here's the lowdown.\nYou get your choice of 9 sauces. (in alphabetical order)\n\n1. Barbeque\n2. BFG\n3. Buffalo\n4. Cheese \n5. Honey Mustard\n6. Ranch\n7. Sweet Chili\n8. Teriyaki\n9. Wasabi Cream\n\nThese are all self explantory except for BFG and Wasabi Cream.\nThe BFG is there secret signature sauce comparable to Raising Canes. The Wasabi Cream tastes just like a sweet, cream cheese type of sauce with just a little bit of spicy kick of wasabi.\n\nSince this is the only location in existence, any time you are in the area, try to take advantage if you are close by. If you are gonna dine in be aware that they only have about 6 tables inside and about 3 tables outside. They are located to the left of Home Depot.\n\nAll in all, I would definitely go back and recommend this place to anybody. Service was nice and they get your food out to you pretty quick. The one only negative I can say is that the strips are just a tad bit small. If you are really hungry, you just might have to order extra strips or sides to compensate. \n\nSo what are you doing still reading this review? Go already! What are you, chicken? LOL.
