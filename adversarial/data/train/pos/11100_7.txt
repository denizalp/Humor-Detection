If I could give it 0 stars I would \n\nThe worst mistake I have made yet. First time my partner and I lived on our own. The experience has been horrible because of Michel Brown and others  employed under him.\n\nMy boyfriend has a pit bull and because of that we had to put a double deposit down which was 1800. Our first day at the house there was weeds up to my knees and there was two dying bushes. We picked this place because it was affordable for us. So after a week of living there I get a call from Michele telling me I need to pull the weeds In the front yard or else I will be charged home association fees I told him they were there before we moved in and it's not fair for me to be charged he said it's my responsibility now and I would be charged if it's not pulled and for me to take a picture and send it to him when I was finished  \n\nOur water heater wasn't working properly. We had no running hot water for almost a month. They wouldn't answer our phone calls, messages or emails. Then I get a text saying \"why aren't you answering your phone focus plumbing is trying to  reach you\" I had no miss calls or messages from anyone. We were taking cold showers in the winter for almost a month before they fixed the problem. \n\nOur lease was expiring so I wrote a letter to give our 30 day notice. I call to try and setup an appointment I left messages with the Secretary I left messages on the voicemail. 2 weeks before we were to move out I see people taking pictures of our house. The day we are suppose to  return the keys they said we didn't give our 30 day notice\n\n\nThis place has caused me a great  deal of stress and anxiety. I feel they took advantage of us because we are young and not experienced this place is jaded and crooked. PLEASE save yourself the trouble and do not rent from these crooked people
