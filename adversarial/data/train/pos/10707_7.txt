Went in here not expecting what I got. I had to sit at the bar and listen to the bartenders political opinion on  race. Just because I'm white doesn't mean I'm going to agree with you. Cancelled my order a day left. If I go to a bar I expect to have food and\/or drinks, not your unsolicited  opinion.
