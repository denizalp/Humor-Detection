We drove 20 minutes for this bakery..it looked so good on yelp and Facebook but oohhh we are so disappointed. .\nThis place is way overpriced  $8 for a small loaf, challa..little Turkish snacks and little cheesecake  $5!!\nWe ended up to but pita bread, 4 pieces $6! With checking out they ask way to much tax, we know it's high in Scottsdale but not + .50 ct!!\nAt home we tried this pita bread. ..no way, this is not pita..this is regular white bread, looks saltless and that for $6.50!!! \nIf they go down with the price to $ 5 a loaf (reasonable) they get more customers..that's for sure!
