A group of friends and I headed over to the Dovercourt House this past weekend to check out the very appealing sounding dance party: Toronto Queer Slow Dance.\n\nI never even knew this place existed, but woah what an amazing find! \nThe Dovercourt House is 3 floors of dance studios -for social dancing... There was a tiny bar in the back of our dance hall but the rest of the space was hardwood floors lined with plush benches and chairs. Insert whatever Strictly Ballroom\/Dirty Dancing fantasies you may want to recreate here. I never knew I could be sooo excited about empty space...\n\nP.S. The Toronto Queer Slow dance also rocked my world. So much Boyz II Men... so many wall-hugging hopefuls waiting for someone to ask for a dance... Sooooo sixth grade... What a great party with such lovely details, like the dance cards with the printed set list and space to sign up for a specific dance. Cute, cute, cute!
