Really enjoyed the cereal milk soft serve and cookies in New York a few years back so I was excited to find out there was a location in Las Vegas - second floor of the Cosmopolitan. \n\nOrdered the single size cereal milk with cornflakes ($7.25). The soft serve is super rich and creamy with the leftover cereal taste lingering behind. Definitely need to add the cornflakes to make the soft serve complete!\n\nIn addition, I also purchased 6 individually wrapped cookies for $22. Two compost, two cornflake chocolate chip marshmallow (one of my favs; not sure how they are able to keep that crunch in the cornflake), and two blueberry & cream. The cookies are best eaten within 4 days of purchase.
