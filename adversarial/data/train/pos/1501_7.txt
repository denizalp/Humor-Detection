YOU. MUST. COME. HERE.\n\nIf not, you are really super lame. I mean it. This place truly is AMAZING.\n\nEvery time I come here, I have the best experience!\n\nThis place seems to transport you back to a time when men and women spoke to each other in a trans-atlantic accent. Ladies wore elegant dresses, pearls, fur shawls and white dinner gloves. Men always had their fedora on, wore pin-striped suits and kept their black and white wingtip shoes shining.\n\nThe very concept of a \"piano bar\" in 2013 seems crazy. But this place pulls it off. I mean, this bar is a total GEM!! It's so rare, and quite refreshing to think that we have a place like this here in Las Vegas. I really want this bar to stay open for a long time.\n\nAll the bartenders are also the singers here, and boy, can they blow! They are all great. They usually have a open mike as well, where members of the audience can sing, if they feel so bold. I want to do it, but I'm too nervous!\n\nThe piano player will also take requests. The times I have been there, I have heard awesome renditions of Jewel, Journey, Adele, and others. Its really fun to sing along with the songs you know, and just sit, chill and listen to the ones you don't.\n\nThe drinks are a little up there, but they are just following the upward trend of most bars in that same area. At least they are not as expensive as Commonwealth!!\n\nThe bar is dark and small, but not in a bad way. It helps to create that more intimate setting that I sometimes crave over the loud dance music and annoying crowds that can plague other places. It also helps give it that 1940's kind of vibe I love so much. They have table seating along with the bar, where you can sit away from the action, or chose to sit right up front by the stage.\n\nI highly recommend this place as a break from the norm. You will probably find me here with beer in tow, posted up at the bar, singing along loudly with the music :)
