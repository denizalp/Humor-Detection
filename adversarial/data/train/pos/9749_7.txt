I wonder if Cox woke up one morning and said to themselves \"How can we suck more at life then we do already?\"\n\nThey found a solution as it turns out. They all it \"upgrading\" but for the last three months, all I get is intermittent internet service and some of the dumbest support staff this side of Dunken Donuts. \n\nI have had Cox internet for 8 months now. I know, I must be very \"special\" as I am pretty much paying for things to work 1\/2 the time they are supposed to. Tomorrow I plan on fixing that by going to ANY OTHER provider. Hell, even as I try to type this is these three paragraphs have taken almost 20 minutes to load up. I could go back to dial up and have better speed than this crap.\n\nWait, there it goes again. Maybe Cox just doesn't want me watching videos about Sheriff Joe...\n\nLong story short, a passenger pigeon would be a faster way to download porn at this point. Stay away from Cox, because they're living the Dewey Cox mantra of \"It doesn't say Cox unless it tastes like Cox....\"
