It's almost like stepping into a time warp. A time machine. Falling the down the rabbit hole. Light at the end of the tunnel. Whatever analogy you use, all you have to do is follow the scent of fresh pizza. Walking through the long hallway decorated with faded album covers, you can't help but say to yourself, \"damn, this is cool.\"\n\nSomehow, things are always cooler when there are no signs. It's hidden in the middle of fine dining, high-end group of restaurants. We're talking about suits, ties, mini-skirts and high heels. Schmoozing and shiny silverware. Then you have this pizza joint. T-shirt and jeans. Paper plates and red pepper shakers.\n\nAt the end of the hallway is a Galaga arcade machine. Bonus points already. Talk about OG, I used to play that game all the time as a kid. It instantly brought back memories. There were several people sitting around, with their backs hunched over enjoying their slices.\n\nWe had just recently finished eating at the Wicked Spoon buffet. My gut was about to explode, but I couldn't leave this place with trying a slice of pizza. I just had to, even if it meant a long night back at the hotel room bathroom. I ordered a slice of pepperoni pizza for $3.50 + tax. I like how they re-heat the pizza in the oven to order, even if it means a slightly longer wait. \n\nThe pizza was scalding hot, and I completely burned the roof of my mouth. It didn't matter. Super thin crust, not overly loaded with cheese, the type you have to fold the pizza in half just to fit it in your grill. This brought back memories of New York. Not too much sauce, not too much cheese -- just the right amount of flavorful NY-style \"pizza grease.\" On a hungry night, I can easily put down an entire pie by myself. Easily.
