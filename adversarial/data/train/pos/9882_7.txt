First time dining in at Sauce, it's a fast dine-in type of place that serves pasta, pizza, wine and the like. Definitely casual, decent pricing and good food.\n\nStopped in with a few gals to have a bite to eat before heading out for cocktails for the night. We decided to share the Wild Mushroom Pizza and the Broccoli Mac & Cheese. \n\nThe pizza came with arugula, mushrooms and truffle oil and was delicious. For you thin, crispy crust fans this is it! Crunch and thin crust with light vegetarian toppings! Very good and not too greasy or heavy feeling. The Broccoli Mac & Cheese was good, well cooked pasta, creamy cheese sauce and pieces of broccoli. Definitely a lot better than The Vig's, it wasn't incredibly rich which made for easy eating and definitely second rounds.\n\nThe place is casual, but appropriate enough for a meal shared between couples. The staff was very pleasant and made sure we were all taken care of! Definitely, gonna come back to satisfy my thin crust pizza cravings!
