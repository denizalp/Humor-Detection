Once you've had a Sonoran Dog from El Guero Canelo in Tucson, you'll do anything to recreate the experience.  I've been looking for a good Sonoran Dog since I moved back to Phoenix 10 years ago and I came to La Pasadita in my quest.  Their Sonoran Dog was just okay, the wiener was small and overcooked.  The star of the show is definitely the creamy corn cocktail.  The service is outstanding, they make you feel their gratitude for your business.
