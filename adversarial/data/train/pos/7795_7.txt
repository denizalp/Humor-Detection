If I had to count the number of hours I have spent in Nose Hill Park, I'm sure it would add up to a lifetime...or two. \n\nNose Hill park is one of the largest municipal parks in Canada and North America. It is the second largest park in Calgary and is often the perfect getaway from the busy city. \n\nNose Hill is where everyone and their dog (literally) goes. It's the perfect off-leash park and it is so big you can walk there for days on end and never pass the same area twice. \n\nI often go there to watch the planes take off and land. The view of the airport from Nose Hill Park is perfect. \n\nJust a note for those of you who will be heading to Nose Hill for the first time: \n\n- Watch your step. There are lots of gopher holes around and rocks and such and if you fall, it could cause serious injury. \n\n- Keep an eye on your dog(s). Because Nose Hill is so huge, there is A LOT of wildlife there. It's common for dogs to come back with a face full of porcupine thorns. It is also common for coyotes to be in the park in the early and late hours of the day. There have been some cases of coyotes attacking dogs. As long as you're careful though, such cases can be avoided. I've been walking in Nose Hill my entire life and the ONLY thing that has ever happened to me is that my dog had an encounter with a porcupine. Just be alert and everything will be fine! \n\nIt's truly my favourite park in the city. It's a world away from the world and it's the perfect place to walk off all your problems.
