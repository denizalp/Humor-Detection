The place is named \"campus\" but the boys are hardly campus go-ers. \n\nMostly muscle hunks. If you like guys who look like Ahhh-nold then it is the place for you. Too much muscle is a turn off for me. \n\nHaving said that, the crowd is very friendly and mostly middle aged to elderly gentlemen. Service is slow and it took us forever to get a drink. \n\nThe thing with Montreal strip clubs is that the dancers change very frequently. The dancers from yesterday will not be working there anymore after a week. I still suggest you check it out but, save it for the last.
