It's Labor Day. So I guess I expected the price to go up a little bit, it's 9.99. But wouldn't the food be better today as well? There's no crawfish like usual and none of my vermicelli rice noodles that I like so much here, I usually put that into my soup. My teriyaki chicken was cold as well and I didn't bother trying the sushi, it didn't look very fresh. All the times I've been here the food has been pretty good. Very disappointed in this trip. We came around 5pm. Two stars for the friendly service and always getting our drinks refilled.\n\n\nAfter we ate, my boyfriend and I came to the conclusion that their shrimp ceviche made up for them not having crawfish or my favorite noodles. That fish was deeelish!
