I have  been here several times for gas, car washes and basic services like a change in oil and transmission fluid. I've never had a problem and feel that the service has been good. Yes, they've tried to upsell me on car washes, glass repair, etc. but a simply \"no, thank you\" has sufficed and no hard feelings. They still do a great job cleaning the inside and outside of my car - something I thoroughly hate to do. The price is just OK but if you go on certain days there are specials that make it a GREAT value. I really like how they dry cars by hand and those guys work hard...seriously. I would not want the job b\/c of sheer physical labor involved so I'm giving credit where it's due. Thank you for taking the time to do what I am too lazy to do. I'll just sit here in the shade with my cold drink in hand until you call me over to step into my freshly cleaned car. Ahhhhh yeah!
