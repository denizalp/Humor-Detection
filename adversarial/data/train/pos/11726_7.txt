We were walking around Kierland and the Shake Shack was right in the middle. I always wanted to try this place so lunch time it's SS. \n\nWe walk in and it's nice and clean. Very bright with booths and long tables with bar stools. So we got in line and ordered. \n\nI got the double smoke shack burger with fries and a coffee shake. I thought the burger was really good. A little salty and the chopped cherry peppers really added a small kick to this burger. Thought the burger was nice and juicy. Bun was nice and soft. So a very good burger. The fries were pretty good too. Enjoyed those too and the shake. Got the coffee shake without whip cream. It had a nice coffee flavor. Not overwhelming at all but I thought the shake was very good. \n\nMy son got the shack burger, fries, and a salted Carmel shake. He really liked it and thought the burger was really good. Not bad for a semi fast food place. \n\nOnce you order, they give you a pager when you food is ready. I like that so much better than people yelling your name out and having to wait by the counter. We could just relax at our table and get up to pick up our food. \n\nVery surprised that the manager was walking around and making sure everyone's meal is okay. Very nice touch for a fast food place. Also noticed that they had people who would wipe the table very quickly after people left.  Nice touch too. I like a clean restaurant and clean tables. \n\nSo I thought the food was really good. The people at the counter were nice and friendly plus the manger walking around making sure we were good. This makes then service really good. They have indoor and outdoor tables. Very bright and inviting environment. So I  will be back again if I can find parking at The Kierland (if you know what I mean). Enjoy
