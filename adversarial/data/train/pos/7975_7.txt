When food is this cheap, I almost feel like I don't have a right to complain. I had the fish and chips for $5.99. They were average. Nothing to write grandma and rave about. But it's IKEA...for dinner. I can't expect much. The dessert though was awesome. I would go back for Almond cake any day of the week! On to the shopping.\n\nI only walk through the whole of IKEA if a) it's not busy or b) it's a date. This was both. I actually love IKEA for a date spot. It's cheap food so no one breaks the bank, it's great conversation starters as to why he would choose any bed frame over MALM and you can make fun of the furniture names and the families walking by.\n\nWe strolled along, picking out furniture we would use to stock our \"soon-to-win million dollar Princess Margaret sweepstakes\" homes. We mocked people that weren't going the right way along the directional path. We had deep conversations over the history of bed designations (\"why call it a twin if twin means two?\").  I almost forgot that I was there to shop as well.\n\nI lose my mind in two sections when I'm at IKEA Vaughan: home organization and home decoration. I will spend hours trying to determine which size bin will work for my at-the-moment home organization project. This time, it was buying shoe boxes with clear windows to see what shoes are inside. IKEA also has some great paintings and photos. If I could afford to drop down $200+ on top of the usual IKEA bill, I would buy one on the spot.\n\nI noticed that any straight-laced adult will turn 5 once they enter IKEA. Actually heard a man making a racing car noise as he turned a flat-bed cart around a corner.
