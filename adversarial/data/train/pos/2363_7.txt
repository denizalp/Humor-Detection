Hooray a drive-thru coffe place in my 'hood that's not a Starbucks.  I ordered a signature coconut almond mocha on ice and it is very good.  Strong coffee and not too sweet.  Plus I get the 'bean' part of the name now.  On top of my coffee was a white chocolate covered coffee bean.  Yummy!!!  Staff was very friendly and quick, because it was my first time going they even gave me a coupon for my next trip.  Me loves me some coupons, and they offered up a punch card and let me know Wednesday is double punch day.  I'm from the Northwest and there were coffee places all over, and I miss that.  Having the Human Bean so close to me is like having a little bit of home.
