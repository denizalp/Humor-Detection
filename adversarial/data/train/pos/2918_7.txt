After living in Vegas now for a couple months shy of three years, I've tried several boba joints. This one happens to be only a mile from my place AND CONSISTENTLY the best I've tried. \n\nThere's always a friendly little asian lady, which at this point she knows my order by heart; a taro milk tea with boba made with almond milk. First, her tapioca is always fresh. Nothing irks me more than chewy boba. If you know boba, then you know what I'm talking about. Second, I hate when I still get the powdery residue of the taro mix. Hers never seems to have it. And third, not that this ever mattered in my book but I LOVE that they have vegan options but ONLY particularly at this boba shop. Why? For personal preferences, I cut out cows milk in liquid form 99% of the time. Just can't do it anymore. So for your knowledge, they offer regular milk, chocolate milk and almond milk as options for your beverages. Still on that note, they offer vegan ice cream in such flavors as taro, chocolate peanut butter, pistachio, etc. so much creamier IMO. But of course they have regular ice cream in many other standard and not so standard flavors. \n\nBesides all that, the venue is the standard hole in the wall boba shop. Maybe four tables max. Appropriately priced. Clean. Never overcrowded. And oh! They have stamp cards! Sooo... What're you waiting for?
