This place is bomb! The hype is real. Believe it. I found this place on Yelp! I was not gouged on the pricing and the quickness with which the glass on my phone was replaced was amazing  .....and I don't even like to use that word in my reviews, but when the shoe fits....\n\nI'm so glad I drove the extra few minutes across town. It was worth it!
