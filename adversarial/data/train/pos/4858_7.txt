Despite the negative reviews, I decided to give this place a try.  I'm working nearby so I stopped for lunch.  I've never had Indonesian food before, so I didn't know what to expect.  There was nobody there when I arrived (except what may have been the owner).  I ordered \"Telor Petis\"  (Telor petis     $6.99\nBoil egg, garlic, shallot, finger-root, turmeric, lemongrass, carrot, corn, garlic, shallot, shrimp paste, soy sauce, red chili)   \n\nWhat I got was a boiled egg that had been deep-fried, smothered in a spicy chili sauce, sitting atop a multitude of sauteed fresh green beans and broccoli.  Underneath all that was steamed rice.  There was a brown soy-sauce based sauce on the side which I poured over the whole thing.  Oh, there was also a deep-fried cracker-like thing.  \n\nAnyway, you can see that this doesn't fit the description on the menu at all, so picky eaters would be advised to ask the cook to tell them about the _______.   So, why 4 stars?  Because it was really freaking delicious.  Spicy, fresh, healthy, and exactly what my stomach needed to have in it to turn around and bang out another afternoon.   \n\nI thought it was great.  Maybe next time I'll try the fried chicken.
