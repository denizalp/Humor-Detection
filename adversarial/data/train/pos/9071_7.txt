Last Call is da bomb....I luv me a discount and Last Call delivers. Unlike say TJ Maxx or The Rack, Neiman's is discounting the truly outrageous. Designers with a Capital D. You will not find Liz Claiborne or Anne Klein ala Marshall's. No.Think Chanel, think Vera Wang-Green Label, D&G, Burberry, Ralph Lauren-Purple Lable.  Also think crazy expensive, marked down. So, yes if the cashmere sweater by Chanel  was $2500, it is now $1400 - come on its a deal, albiet a deal at the Mills!  \n\nI come here for career clothes and typically I can find a good pencil skirt by Elie Tahari and a few silk shirts for under a $100.00. Granted, I'm shopping the 30% rack and only on the days that the whole store is 30% on top of it.  Everything is one of a kind - think only one size. The only eggshell blue St. John's cardigan with jewel buttons was in my size and 85% off - $30 smackers and it is exquisite. I look like a million bucks for $30.00. \n\n I drop by a few times a month to check out the deals and usually there are always a few to pick from.  My career wardrobe is growing with some beautiful pieces thanks to NM.
