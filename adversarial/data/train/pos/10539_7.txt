Cheap prices, but of course you get what you pay for. Our sink was almost clogged when we arrived, towels were worn and smelled funky, really cheap beds with thin blankets. SMALL tv (26 inch). The parking is horrible and there is no cameras\/security in the parking lot. Went out on my last day and came home at 4am, check out at 12 and find my car broken into with my complete sound system stolen including a laptop, gopro camera, and dre beats detox headphone missing. Everything was hidden from site, only the headunit was visible. Call security to file a report. They are USELESS. They couldnt even work a digital camera correctly. I doubt they will do anything about this and I wont hear back from their risk management team. I couldve stayed at the Cosmopolitan and got a table at Marquee with the money I lost from the things stolen out of my car. Will never stay here again.
