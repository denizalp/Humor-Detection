Quick Sand or Sand Trap?\nBy The Rue\n\nSandbar, Sandbar I know your trick,\nIt isn't the food that gets me to stick,\nIt wasn't the fajita burrito with chicken inside,\nIt is the yummy workers I must confide.\n\nI'm not sure my waitresses name,\nI'll have to come back when I have more game,\nOf course I'm not telling the truth,\nI was raised right and have more couth.\n\nGoing off topic, back to the review,\nThe selection is decent on their menu,\nI wasn't a big fan of the rice and beans,\nBoth were lacking in this cuisine.\n\nThe icead tea was good and filled up often,\nI was never a big fan of Kenny Loggins,\nThis is the first time that I've been here,\nDidn't even have time to order a beer.\n\nI certainly want to come here for happy hour,\nI'll probably have a beer not a whiskey and sour,\nThe patio seems like a fun place to chill,\nNext time write your number on my bill. \n\nBump, Set, SPIKE!!!
