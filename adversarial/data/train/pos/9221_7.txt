I'd be lying if I said I didn't find this place in a drunken stupor but that does not take any value out of the following review!\n\nDowntown Brampton has something that is cool and original. I didn't know if I would ever say that.\n\nThe d√©cor is amazing. The whole concept seemed so fresh and modern and yet inviting; I can't say enough good things. The service was really friendly. The food is almost unreasonably inexpensive. \n\nAnd the offerings are different enough that I want to try everything on the menu. How bold is it to serve beets with so many menu items? Bold but awesome because beets are dope.\n\nEven as I'm writing this review I am mad at myself for not coming here since the last time I came here. GO NOW. Support this place Brampton. Seriously.
