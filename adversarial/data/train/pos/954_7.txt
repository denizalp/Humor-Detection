Definitely not what I expected for a Scottsdale club.  We went here last week to see DJ Steve Aoki visiting from L.A.  Major props to E4 for bringing a master hipster DJ to Scottsdale.  Huh?  The crowd went wild with his skilled sets (although I could have done without Daft Punk's One More Time) and offers of shots from his Grey Goose bottle.\n\nI was warned by Max to not wear casual shoes otherwise I would not be let in.  Not sure if it was due to the crowd Aoki draws, but there were Converse and other hipster shoes galore in this place.  So we donned black leather loafers with our otherwise casual duds and ventured in.\n\nThe different rooms (and sounds in each room) while they added to the place, seemed kind of cheaply done -- not as impressive as it sounds, that's for sure.  The outdoor patio was my favorite, with the spraypaint artists videos and whatevers.  The booths were like inflatable blow-up furniture though -- weird.\n\nThe worst offense was the bar service.  Long waits on more than once occasion.  Bud Light and Corona are the only beers offered here.  Really?  I mean, really?\n \nI probably won't be coming back with the bad bar service and dress code (although non-existent when I was there), but E4 had the cojones to bring Steve Aoki to town -- upping a 2 star review to 3 stars.
