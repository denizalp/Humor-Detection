FINALLY a dealer i was impressed with. WOW Good job guys. \n\nIn my seemingly never ending quest for best bang for the buck i ventured there. Sure, it says SUPER BIKE and might be a bit off putting but one should totally ignore it and go there. And once inside you will be razzled-dazzled by all the cool machinery there: Ducattis, Moto-Guzzis, Triumphs, Victory Motorcycles are all present there. Many different models too. In long gleemy rows. HAWT DAMN! \nStaff is very helpful too and knows their stuff. I did not feel pressured or anything. \nSure, all those Italian exotics might be a little more then your average Honda or Yamaha but C'MON - Look at them!!! So friggin cool. Bahhh too bad it IS more then your average run of the mill bike and i will not be looking that way for a good long time. But when i will, take my word for it, AZ Superbike will be first stop on my list!
