A piping hot bowl of fish noodles is perfect for a cold night! I came here on Wednesday around 10pm.\n\nFor $8.25: Choice of broth (many choices!), noodle, 2 toppings, and a drink. I like that they indicate which have no MSG and there really is a lot of variety to choose from. \n\nI ordered original fish broth with thick rice noodles, green veggie (choi sum) and fish fillet (actual fish, not fish ball\/paste). The bowl itself already comes with napa cabbage, dried bean curd and some mushroom. The soup is fairly light and milky. I like that it's definitely hot enough and a very large portion, but it could be stronger in fish taste and a bit thicker.\n\nThe HK style milk tea needs major improvement. It tastes like it has no cream at all and couldn't be saved with two packs of sugar. \n\nMy boyfriend ordered from the late night special menu which has a lot of appealing rice and noodle options. He got the Spicy Beef & Enoki Mushroom Vermicelli. It definitely is spicy!! Pretty good.
