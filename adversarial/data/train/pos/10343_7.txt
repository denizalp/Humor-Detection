Several days before we flew to Canada, my fiance found the Culinary Adventure Company. We signed up for the Riverside\/Leslieville Food Tour because it happened on a Wednesday and fit right into our schedule. What I liked about this area (Riverside) was that there were absolutely no Starbucks around. Instead you find local, organic coffee shops. We wanted to experience the mom-pop shops, hole in the wall, etc.\n\nMegan was our tour guide and she was amazing! She was extremely knowledgeable about the history of the buildings, the culture of the food, and the background of the owners of the shops. We got to learn a lot of history while we ate. This food tour wasn't like the other ones that we have done (San Francisco, Hawaii, Chicago, etc). For example, on one of the many stops we got to experience was an olive oil tasting (thanks Paula! lol). Honestly, I've never heard of or even thought about pouring and taking shots of olive oil straight like it was a good time but I'm glad I did it. We learned a lot about olive oil, amongst other things. If we ever come back to Toronto, I would definitely hit up Culinary Adventure Company again and try their other tours. \n\nNote: For this tour, there is a parking structure right by the meeting point so you don't have to worry about that.
