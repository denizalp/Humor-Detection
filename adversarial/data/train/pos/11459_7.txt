I was excited that a new hookah lounge opened pretty close to where I live! The other ones I go to are near the strip and get crowded with tourist pretty fast. I came by the other day during their happy hour (5-8pm) to check it out. It's very nice inside but it is a little small. They have a relaxed atmosphere and I like that they play music videos on multiple tv screens. \n\nThe hookah was only $10 and one of the servers suggested blue mist mixed with orange and I really liked it. The food and drinks were mediocre.... I ordered 2 margaritas and didn't even have a buzz after. My friend ordered Hennessy & Sprite and it was also watered down. I tried the mini tacos that were $2 each, one steak & one chicken and they were both bland. \n\nThe customer service was really good and everyone was friendly. I might stop by in another month or so to see if the food and drinks have improved.
