Deli, mini grocery store, bakery, dessert, and coffee\/smoothie drinks. This store has a little bit of everything, from sandwiches to sushi to breakfast food and even crepes.  Here's how it worked: order at the counter, get your receipt, walk outside or to the next room for a seat, and go back to the counter to get your order. \n\n- Hot-pressed tuna sandwich: tuna salad on whole wheat with cheddar and a pickle on the side. YUM! Warm, tasty, and healthy too.\n- Lemonade: SUPER tart, it pretty much tasted like no sugar was added to it. I doused it with packs of sugar, which didn't make my meal so healthy after all. \n- Red velvet cake: surprisingly moist with delicious cream cheese frosting. \n\nParking is limited. Food took a while to come out, but that was because it was during lunch time. Dessert crepes that some patrons ordered looked really good, so I'll have to try it the next time I'm in town.
