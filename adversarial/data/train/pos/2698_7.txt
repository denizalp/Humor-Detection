Got season passes for the family this year.  We live very close to the park and looking forward to a summer of water park fun.  The park is small but there is plenty to do.  The slides are pretty good.  They currently have 8 different slides.  I wish they had more family options for smaller kids who aren't quite big enough to ride the slides solo.  The kids area is ok, kinda small and geared towards tots.  My girls who are 6 enjoy it but are caught in the middle of the kid area which is a little to small for them and the bigger slides that they need an adult to ride with.  That leaves the wave pool and the lazy river.  Both are fun but sometimes you wanna go on the slides like your big brother.  Food prices aren't too bad and food is average.  No complaints.  Burgers and fries, hot dogs, corn dogs, nachos that sort of thing.  Typical for any kind of entertainment venue.  You can bring in sealed bottle water or get one of their refillable Cowabunga Bay cups for $9 and get $1.50 refills the rest of the season.  That's a good deal.  They have a small bar where you can get beer, wine and frozen mixed drinks.  Only on the busiest days will you have trouble finding seating.  The cabanas are nothing special.  I guess I have been spoiled with hotel cabanas in the past.  There are 2 different cabanas the standard with cheap plastic furniture and not much else and the VIP which is upgraded furniture (that's not saying much), ceiling fan and mini fridge.   Unless you have a large group and going on a busy day I wouldn't waste money on a cabana.
