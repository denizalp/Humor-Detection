Where do I even begin. The only good thing about this place were the nice young ladies behind the counters. They were nice. The place is pretty cool looking. Clean and new. It was my 1st time there, stopped in after a long day at work. I didn't want to cook. It's just me and another person. I ordered the bigger pepperoni pizza, house salad and a scoop of Galatto to go. When I got home and dished out the salad, we found the lettuce pieces way to big to eat without cutting them up. It was only greens and 3 shavings of parmesan cheese.  It was lacking any reason to eat it or order it again. I opened the pizza box to find a cracker with some sause and pepperoni.  If there was any cheese on it, we couldn't find any. It was flavorless and flat. We have been waiting so long for a decent restaurant in my neighborhood and this is just another huge disappointment.  So now along with the other terrible restaurant on this corner, I give this place 2 thumbs down. It was expensive for this less than mediocre product. We can only hope TapHouse and Zipps are able to pull this area out of the depths of mediocrity.  \nSorry to the nice people who work there.
