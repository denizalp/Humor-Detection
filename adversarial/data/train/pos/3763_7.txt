Theres a large part of me that hates huge shipping centers like this with a passion. Driving by it on the 202, you just see huge, distracting neon lights and my first thought is \"tacky\". \n\nThe days of strolling down main street, window shopping while licking at an ice cream cone from the local ice cream soda pop shop then deciding to catch a flick at the local movie house are done. Now we pull into football sized parking lots to wander like zombies in shopping plazas full of Bed Bath and Beyonds or Victoria's Secrets, Starbucks and Coldstones. Then to stumble, numbed, into an AMC to watch some horrible blockbuster made by a film studio who's sole purpose is to rake in the cash. \n\nSigh.
