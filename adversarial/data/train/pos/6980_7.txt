If I could pay rent and live here that would be ideal. \nWe received free day passes as part of my friend's wedding package (normally $45\/day or included with purchase of services). This was easily one of the highlights of my Vegas stay, a great getaway from all the smoke\/crowds downstairs. \n\nI told my boyfriend I'd be back in 20 minutes, and almost worried him dissapearing into this beautiful world for 2+ hours. Whoops. \n\nThe changing room is a bit small, they provide you with a robe, though clothing is optional, and slippers. First I went into the larger jacuzzi room which had 3 separate pools of different temperatures. I was alone in the largest jacuzzi for a while despite it being a Saturday and waded around like a happy child. Along the jacuzzi are warm\/heated seats that just make you want to take a nap. You can leave your robe in a heated closet. \nThen I went to the tea room to refresh myself from all the calories i burned sitting in the jacuzzi. They provide coffee, tea, juices, fruits, and pretzals. Not gonna lie- took some snacks back for the bf. \nThere are two sauna rooms. One is \"herbal,\" the entire room fogs up and if there was someone else with me in the room I wouldn't have known. The other one is some sort of wood that features dry heat. Both felt amazing. I peaked into the Arctic room, but didn't get the appeal. \nShowering here was amazing too. There were 4 shower heads that you could choose from in various combinations- my own little waterfall world. \nVanity area includes blow dryers, hair straighteners, curling irons, hair sprays, lotions.\n\nI was so so sad to leave
