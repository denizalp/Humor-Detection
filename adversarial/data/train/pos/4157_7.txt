Phoenix is my happy place. This local coffee shop achieves the perfect balance of character, creativity and neighborhood vibes. \n\nHOLY PATIO. If you're looking for a spacious, inviting patio to grab a drink with friends, have a super cozy first date, or just to do work, this is your place. I could sit out here for hours with a book. It's the chicest, minimalist city patio any coffee or tea lover could ask for.\n\nThe interior has surprisingly robust seating for a small place. There are a few high tops, bar seating and some small arm chairs. You can cozy up against the record player or join the community table with cute terrariums. I swear to god, the last time I was here, a communal sing-out to Fleetwood Mac's \"Go Your Own Way\" randomly happened out of nowhere. THESE ARE MY PEOPLE.\n\nI love Phoenix for their tremendous tea options, particularly as someone who is only * trying * to start to like fancy coffee. In general, I find that the people who gather here are super interesting creatives, intellectual and neighborhood folk who are generally respectful of the shared atmosphere. It's so distinctly lovable and Ohio City. When I'm sitting here, I'm completely energized. It also makes me want to become a novelist. I'm not sure why.
