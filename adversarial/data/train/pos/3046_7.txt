One year, by matter of coincidence, I was in Bobby D's for a drink after work on St. Patrick's day and I couldn't help but notice the steady stream of neighborhood folk coming in for take out corned beef and cabbage. \n\nThis year, I enlisted a coworker to accompany me and bear witness to the fact that it was NOT a liquid lunch so I could see what the fuss was about! (It is a workday, after all!) \n\nFor $7.95 you get a platter full of well-seasoned, fork-tender corned beef, at least a quarter of a boiled cabbage, cooked carrots and potatoes. A small plate featuring creamy horseradish, horseradish and spicy mustard was delivered with our meal. Corned beef sliders were another option ($5.95), although we took the traditional route. \n\nWhile the flavor on the corned beef was excellent (we detected a hint of cinnamon), the veggies lacked seasoning. \n\nOther fun facts about what you can find at Bobby D's: \n~ Lots of neighborhood peeps sportin' their green on St. Patty's \n~ TVs -- I got to watch a little of the NCAA tournament during lunch! \n~ $1 vodka soaked gummy bears (an interesting novelty in which I did not indulge)
