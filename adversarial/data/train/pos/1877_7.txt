I come here for the shakes & love their double chocolate fudge shake! AMAAAZIINGGGGG! I mean I could finish two of them, or three, or even TEN! Why haven't I had them before? \noh, thats right the LOOONG Lines & the not-so great burgers.\n\nThe shake itself is wonderful but the steak burger not so much, it is VERY dry and does not have much taste to it.  I wish it tasted better & i would have been coming here ALL THE TIME. \nThe service is sub-par, it is almost like a diner but fast-food joint. \n\nI would have given it a two-star, but their shakes are amazing.
