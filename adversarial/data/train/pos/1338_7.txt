Wow so coming in from LA my sister said let's grab a coffee. Turned up at samba the best the neighborhood has to offer for coffee shops.  Said \" great lets go!\" Turned up there wer NO tables available and one lady sat at a big table and there where 4 of us   ok well it's a Sunday,, waited for our drinks and when my Nutella latte came out I was SHOCKED at the size of the coffee that cost over $4.00! It was tiny! I asked what size is this ? She replied umm the size we do out cappuccinos & lattes. It was close to the size of a espresso cup! Such a rip off! And the fact that you pay $10 for a sandwich & over $4 for a tiny latte they don't even bring it out to you,, Buttt!! They come outside and shout your name for you to come and get it ,, why don't they just bring it!!! Coming from Beverly Hills and enjoying Urth cafe on my Sunday morning coffee this join  definitely need to stack up that service and the size of cups make no sense they gave me a large cup tree for the Americano and a tiny cup for a cappuccino what a rip off. I'm in shock that the price and size considering I live in Beverly Hills which is the most expensive place to live I think in all of America apart from New York that this little place charges more and why?\n\nPlease!\n\nVery unhappy
