I have a vague memory from 2009 of coming to an Italian place in this location, but on a rainy day it was empty.  I remembered it as being pretty decent and thought, hey this place seems like it's in the same spot so it must be the same place!\n\nFirst off, it was packed at 7pm on a Friday but my dad and I were able to get the perfect table out on the front patio.  Our waitress was really nice and, although she had a lot of tables she was looking after, made good recommendations.\n\nBy far the favorite thing I ate here was the warm mushroom arugula salad, which was recommended to us by our waitress (instead of the caprese salad).  It was so good that I'm still dreaming about it today.  The mushrooms were salty and lemony and they coated the greens and warmed them up nicely.\n\nFor our entree, we decided to split a pasta and a pizza.  Note from me: skip the pizza!  Our \"marguerite\" pizza was just a very cheesy mess.  It tasted better next day.  It was nothing like a pizza marguerite (and does not look like the ones posted previously on yelp).  The pasta we had was one of the special ones, and I can't remember the name.  Kind of like half moon raviolis.  It was good, but man the sauce was great!  Next time I'd say get an appetizer and then maybe 2 pastas to split ... but skip the pizza for sure.\n\nAll in all, really pleasant experience.  Oh, and I had a tiramisu to go.  Was super good.  Only thing I remember not liking about my dining experience (besides the pizza) was the fact that the napkins were paper.
