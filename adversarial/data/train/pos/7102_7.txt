Sorry, Black Chile... I just wasn't a fan!\n\nJared and I felt like trying something new one night last week, and after reading about how great Black Chile's burger was from our friends at EaterAZ, we thought we'd give this place a shot.\n\nThe restaurant itself is spacious, the hostess and service attentive and friendly, and the decor is tasteful.  But unfortunately the food was nothing special, and I won't be rushing back...\n\nWe started with chips and salsa.  I think they bring these to everyone.  These weren't bad.  For our meals, Jared went with the burger and I went for the fish tacos (per our waitress's recommendation) and a side of corn.  I liked the sticky rice and beans it came with but the rest of the meal was underwhelming.  Jared didn't love his either.\n\nSince my visit, I learned that this concept comes from restaurateurs Michael McDermott and Jason Merritt, who have been involved with the development of numerous restaurants including the famed Kona Grill. I thought it felt a little chainy!  That explains it ;)\n\nI'm pregnant so I didn't have a Corona or margarita, which may have made my meal taste better, but regardless, I've experienced much better Mexican food before... and with so many other Mexican concepts to choose from in the Valley, I probably won't be rushing back. Lo siento again, Black Chile!
