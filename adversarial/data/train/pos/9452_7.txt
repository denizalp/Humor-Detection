Best gelato in Vegas and I like the new location a lot better than the sketchy area of Art of Flavors! Gelato messina was my sub in after Art of Flavors closed, but Gelatology definitely has a much creamier in texture.  The variety of flavors is more limited but I think more creative than Gelato Messina.  We tried the halo halo and green tea kit kat gelato and both were amazing!  I can't wait for my next trip out here!  I noticed they also have additional desserts available now, like cookies and macarons, etc.
