This Del Taco location can be found on the west side of Rainbow Blvd., just north of Warm Springs. It is easy to spot just south of the Hooters Restaurant. \n\nIt is ok for what it is. It is cheap, quick food available 24\/7.\n\nI love their chicken soft tacos! I also love that they have an extensive menu of items under 99 cents! You can grab a value size burrito, a mini quesadilla, some hard shelled tacos, or nachos among many other items! All of these things (and more) are priced at just  99 cents or less! The food I have gotten here has been solid by Del Taco standards. Nothing over the top, but not bad either.\n\nThe service is okay. I've certainly had worse at other Del Taco locations. That being said, keep your expectations realistic. \n\nSo, I guess what I am saying is that this location is your standard, run of the mill Del Taco. It is what it is. Nothing more, nothing less.\n\nIt's A-ok...for what it is...\n\n3 stars.
