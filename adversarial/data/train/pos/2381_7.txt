We came here for mother's day brunch. Very unorganized staff... i worked in restaurants for 10 years and i know mother's day is one of the busiest days of the year. But this place was a mess. The hostesses were so backed up (not their fault) that reservations had to wait 45 minutes for their table.  Then when they did try to seat us they gave us a table in a totally separate room not a part of the actual restaurant. There was only one other table and there was no music playing or anything. The table wasn't even set with place settings.  Not really acceptable after waiting 45 minutes for a table with reservations. I ended up speaking to a female manager and she told me that they used the other room for catering and that she couldn't move us because we were already sat... Not the friendliest or most professional way to handle the situation. Luckily the young hostess was much more helpful and moved us to a nice table by the piano. \n\nOur server was nice enough... although when we sat he said he would send out a sampling of the entire menu. It honestly felt like he just didn't really have time to take our order. Plus we ended up not getting everything on the menu anyway. The food was decent for the most part but nothing worth $65 per person plus an additional $20 for mimosas. \n\nI wanted to like this place; we love going to nice \"locals\" type of restaurants. It has nice views of the lake and could have been great,  but they have really got to work out their issues.  Unfortunately we will not be back.
