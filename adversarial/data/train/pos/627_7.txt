Cute little cafe with an very unique interior. I got the veggie burger during their lunch hours on a Wednesday. It wasn't crowded and we were seated quickly which was nice. Our waiter was incredibly attentive and made sure we had everything we needed. \n\nMy one main complaint was my veggie patty. Though I appreciate the freshness and quality of ingredients of the patty, I found it overall to be pretty bland. Even with the avocado aioli it just didn't do much for me. It was interesting that it looked more like roughly chopped vegetables kind of compressed into patty form unlike your typical brown mush\/blended patties you can buy at the store. I liked this concept but I think it needed some kind of binding agent to pull it all together.\n\n\nOverall it was a nice stop for lunch, though I wish I had gotten something different.
