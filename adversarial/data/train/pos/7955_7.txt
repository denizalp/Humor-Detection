Cheap, yes. But nasty. Dull flavors, beyond cheap ingredients. There's veg fare to be gotten here, but so much better on almost every other corner in this part of town.\n\nKind of amazing to me that even tho they're smack dab in the middle of Burrito Way that they continue to do business - hit Maria's around lunchtime and you'll find the explanation: mostly gringos, slurping up the watered down salsa, ordering the 5 dollar lunch special and leaving 1 dollar tips. \n\nNo, gracias.
