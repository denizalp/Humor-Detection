I'm not sure why this place doesn't have better ratings.\n\nI loved it. I guess full disclosure, I tend to visit the places I review after a workout so I'm starving and I usually go solo and at off peak times, usually mid afternoon, so I never usually run into any issues with wait times or service issues.\n\nThis place was great, the BBQ was delicious, but I know nothing of proper BBQ, this tasted great to me, all this gibberish about fall of the bone or not, who cares. It tastes great.\n\nThe real star of this place is the crazy doughnut\/smores monstrosity for dessert. SO EFFIN GOOD!\n\nGo NOW, right now! NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOW
