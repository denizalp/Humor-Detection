Take me down to Strike City where you gotta be rich to bowl in this city...\n\nSo yeah its hella cash to bowl, like $45 per lane and hour. But if you must roll (the ball that is), you're gonna look good doing it. Fat Tire for 2 bones on Tuesday...call my drunk ass a cab and I'm calling in at work on Wednesday. The food is okay...actually comes out of the adjoining food establishment Libretto's next door unless they task Mr. One Pin Rick to  rock the grill and clean the gutters too. If you want some privacy ask for the 2 lanes on the right and it looks like your in the house of some ballers game room...schawing!\n\nBurrrpp. One more Fat Tire pa-lease! :)
