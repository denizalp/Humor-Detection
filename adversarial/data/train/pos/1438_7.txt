The owner of this place who answers the phone to take orders is rude!  Pizza is actually okay, but definitely will not be ordering from a place with rude service.  I called in to ask what were the specials since their specials change daily, and his answer was whatever is on our menu.  Well rude owner, we didn't eat their enough to KNOW what is on your menu and never will know the muni since you have such a bad attitude.  Learn a little customer service or your business will fail.  Another time I called to place an order on the phone I asked if this was the same owner as the other location on Craig road, his response was, are you trying to insult me?  You can't talk to new customers like we've gone there for years....  We'll settle for another pizza shop with customer service skills.  Bye linos!
