The food we tried was really good -- we shared three appetizers.  One was some kind of cheesy corn au gratin thing...can't remember but it was amazing.  We had a flatbread little pizza thing that was pretty off the hook too.  And some Korean fried cauliflower.  Very good.\n\n3 Friends:\n\n2 cosmos\n2 glasses of house wine\n1 Bloody Mary\n3 appetizers\n\nJust barely under $100.   I thought it was a bit steep, but maybe I'm just old and out of touch?  My friends seemed a little shocked too though.\n\n\nThe waiter was a doll.  He took care of us and laughed at all of my stupid jokes -- and he managed to look like he wasn't annoyed by having to fake it.  Tip: $30.  I appreciate a man who can fake it well.
