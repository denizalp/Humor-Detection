i would consider lulu's to be my favorite local breakfast joint and bakery.\ni'm ecstatic that they're in my neighborhood!\n\nlulu's started out as a food truck called \"lulu's on the move\".\ni never had the pleasure of trying them out then but i'd heard so many great things so, of course, was extremely happy to hear that they were opening a brick and mortar in our neighborhood.\nit took some time, as most restaurants do, but they finally opened.\nwe've since had many a breakfast\/brunch there.\n\nwalking into lulu's gives you the sense that you've left las vegas.\nthe decor and ambiance make you feel like you're in the pacific northwest or something which is appropriate considering lulu's is in northwest Las Vegas.\ni absolutely love that.\nand with the smell of fresh baked bread emanating from their bakery, i could just stay there for hours.\n\nthe restaurant is set-up like your typical bakery\/deli\/cafe.\nyou order and pay at the counter, they give you a table sign, you sit wherever you like and they bring your food to your table.\nit's not full service but the service you do get is always friendly and fast.\n\ni've had the opportunity to sample many of their offerings and some of my favorites are:\n\nFrittatas\nTartines\nHashes\nGuava croissant is the biz\nRaisin custard roll\nCronuts\nCookies\nBasically anything from their bakery is delicious!\n\nIf you haven't had a chance to yet, come visit the Las Vegas northwest for a little comfort food and baked goodness at lulu's.
