Solid Thai food and friendly staff!\n\nI ordered take-out for some weekend lunch with the wife. We chose Thai On Demand based on the Yelp reviews. We had the pad thai and yellow curry both with medium heat. The dishes were pretty good, but were more mild than a medium heat. Next visit I'll order the dishes with the next level higher as I do enjoy the flavor\/heat with Thai food. The staff member I picked up my order from was very friendly and wanted to make sure I had everything I needed for my take-out order. \n\nI was really happy with the overall experience at Thai On Demand and will stop in again soon!
