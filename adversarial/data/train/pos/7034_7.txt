Where has this place been all my life? This was my first visit.\nIf you like good steak, come here.  If you like good food, come here. Their menu is written on this huge chalkboard on the wall when you walk in.  My eyes gravitated towards their 5 steak cuts (flank, sirloin, skirt, ribeye, NY strip), so I can't comment on the other menu choices (yet!!!).  \n\nSo once me and my dinner date got to the register, we ended up getting the Asado platter ($50) which contains all 5 cuts of heaven-- I mean steak. They say that's roughly 25oz of steak!  It also comes with three pieces of toast and chimichurri already on top.  \n\nService was so fast!  And I was so fortunate to have come when there was no line (we got there around 6:15ish on a Tuesday)  We were seated very promptly, and served our food in a reasonable time too. I forgot to say that the ambiance isn't so quiet, so it's hard to have a good conversation in my opinion.\n\nThe only thing I wish is that it had salad on the side like the individualized steak platters have.  I needed some greens after downing more than 10oz of steak.. oh and UGHHH the sauces. Sososo yummy, just get all 4 and try them for yourselves.  I wanted to cry after eating my first piece. Ahhh... just thinking about it now I want to go back.  On the platter, they usually seem to organize the cuts in a certain order of sirloin, NY, skirt, ribeye, and flank.  In my opinion, the most expensive cut, the skirt, was my least favorite. My most favorite has to be the sirloin or flank, as they were the most tender.  Gaucho lives up to the hype.  Stop reading my review and just go eat there already!
