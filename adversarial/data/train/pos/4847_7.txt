Ok, so maybe I came here with really high standards I don't know. The concept is awesome, fresh, local, farm to table cuisine... I mean you really can't get much more farm to table than Quiessence because your literally on a farm! The ambiance is beautiful, making it a perfect spot for a romantic meal.\nThe part that bummed me out was the food was delicious but not out of this world amazing. I enjoyed the Kobocha Squash Soup which was served with an apple relish, tessa, goat cheese mouse and fried rosemary it was velvety and delicious but didn't WOW me. Next up was the Hamachi Crudo, that was the real star of the evening. It was fresh and flavorful! For my entr√©e I had the Dayboat Alaskan Halibut, it had a great crust but my fish was overcooked and kind of dry and there wasn't much flavor development with the veggies and sauce that it was served with. Presentation of the food was beautiful, it was almost too beautiful to eat. I just wished that there was as much effort into flavor as presentation. Our server was wonderful, couldn't have asked for better service! Maybe I came on an off night, so I am going to have to come back!
