The service was impeccable, as usual and the Mother's Day brunch was spectacular, as usual. The valet parking was outstanding, as usual however my only pain point was an undisclosed Service Fee of 23% added to the bill and highlighted. When I asked the waitress if that was the gratuity she said it wasn't. So, by the time you add 25% for gratuity and pay the service charge (like it's room service) you're actually paying an additional 48%! There are a lot of great restaurants in town with the same service, quality and you'd be saving 23%...
