There are circles where my opinion doesn't count and the USPS is clearly one of those circles.\n\nI imagine that someone like the postmaster of a USPS gets to make maybe 2 or 3 decisions a year and cannot fathom the qualities that makes one better than another except when facing one of these infrequent times to actually have to make a decision, they not only blow it but blow it with maximum impact on the maximum number of people. To the Scottsdale postmaster, I salute you with a job well done.\n\nSeemed innocent enough...Aging postal facility in area where the ever growing Scottsdale Memorial Hospital wants to expand makes deal to sell property and relocate the post office. Finds newly vacated Scottsdale Road location of failed furniture store which offers more space - I'm good.\n\nNow for the fun part. I've had a PO Box there since 1982. EVERYONE knows my PO Box Address.\n\nHere's where they blew it...most of the PO Boxes in the 'old' Post Office were combination mailboxes...no key needed. They don't do that anymore and want to play keymaster. So the big decision is that everyone who had a combination lock mailbox would get a new PO Box number - you can't keep the old number.\n\nMy mail runs 40% mine, 40% whoever had the PO Box # before they arbitrarily assigned it to me and 20% who knows...no relation to either PO Box number, new or old but close enough for government work I guess.\n\nNow I recognize that postal employees do the best they can with what they're dealt and I actually have a friend whose husband works at that post office and agreed that this has been an unmitigated disaster.\n\nI think I should nominate this for a 'Great American Heroes' radio commercial because when they blow it...they do it with style.
