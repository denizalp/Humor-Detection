If you consider lightly peeing the bed, with no visible evidence whatsoever room damage!!! This is the place for you!\nI kindly asked the housekeeper to change the sheets after a slight night time accident and I was charged $200.00- the hotel claimed it us there policy to throw away everything  even the duvet !!\nThey called it biohazard!!!\nI can't believe that every person leaving any semen or blood on the sheets are charged $200. And it is considered a biohazard!!\nIf I had not told the housekeeper no one would have even known!!\nThe managment said there was nothing they could do about there \" policy\" \nSeriously? Did I just fall off a turnip truck ? Of course the Manangment can remove the charge!! \nI am a seasoned traveler! I was even Interviewed on CNN as there Road Warrior, and gave travel tips! I AM APPALLED! I travel to Las Vegas 3 or 4 times a year and I will NEVER go back!! \nI'm going back to the Wynn, where class and customer service still mean something.
