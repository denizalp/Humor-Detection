Brand new place.  How can they have reviews before Chrismas?\n\nThe food was fresh, but the service ... what service?  They don't know what they are doing!\n\nGlad to have a place with the O-K Kosher symbol.  For a visitor like me, I appreciate a \"pita joint' with international kosher symbol and reputation, instead of just one rabbi.\n\nI plan to review it in the future!
