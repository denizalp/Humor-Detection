If this is Mod Mex, count me in! Seems like there are a lot of places calling themselves mod mex popping up lately, but I doubt they can do the quality flavors and ingredients this place does at this this price point. The flavor explosions that El Carnicero bring keep me coming back for more. I can barely get past the machaca brisket taquitoes and fundido cheese dip to try anything else, but after bringing my visiting relatives here and trying their pork tamale dish, I'll be giving that a try next time, another out of this world flavor invasion on my palette. \nNot to mention the fun atmosphere that surrounds you! You almost feel as if you attending a Lucha  libre event when you dine here! The masks, the awesome branding, the warmth. In a way, it is an event. Your tastebuds versus the El Carnicero flavors. You will submit!
