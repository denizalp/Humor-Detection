I came in to get a pedicure and to relax. Last time they did an OK job so I didn't think anything could go wrong. I had asked to pay for a longer massage ...  She said ok and I got a massage on my shins for a short couple minutes and no where else. I realized she started painting my toe nails I wasn't getting a massage and asked her why I didn't get one and she didn't understand what I was asking. \n\nLast time I visit this location.
