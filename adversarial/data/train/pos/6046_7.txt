I am going to give Temple 3 stars. Why? I have enjoyed the food there and the drink specials on reverse happy hour are great. Now Richard Z didn't enjoy the smothered tots, but I assured him it was an off night. The 3 times I have had them they have been great. Cheddar and bacon, dip them in a little ranch and you have a great late night snack. The chips and salsa are always available. Be prepared as the salsa has what I would call a lasting affect on your mouth, like a day or so. $3 beers on tap, Carlsberg and Stella being a couple of the choices, always puts a smile on my face. \n\nThis has become our late night after hockey place. Not sure how I feel about that just yet, but for now it will have to do.
