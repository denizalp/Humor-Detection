I always make this a place to stop by when in Madison. The food is typically what you would find in any Filipino home, truly a \"home cooked\" restaurant. The price is very reasonable, so the choices may not be numerous. Not everyone appreciates fried fish but this would be the place to try it out. The adobo was good, the pinakbet and sinigang flavorful. The d√©cor was sparse. During a recent visit, there was no wait staff to clean the tables right away.
