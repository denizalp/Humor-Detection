We order from their catering menu and what is better than eating soft tacos? It's being able to make them yourself!!!   The only problem is that the stuffing is so good that the wraps are never big enough. \n\nThe chicken and pulled pork are 100% yum.  You absolutely MUST top with the pickled onions!!! It really adds an extra dimension to your taco. Their chips are very crispy, thick cut and pretty addictive with the guacamole. Tostitos got nothing on them!
