Wow! I have been to some pizza places in my day let tell you! We all have haven't we??.... But without papers in one of the best pizza places I have ever been to in my 28 years on this planet! Our meal was literally perfect, not one small squabble or defect in the food. Perfect, it's a rare thing to find let me tell you!\n\nI came here with here with my good pal and fellow yelper Andy D who is a true pizza connoisseur and boy oh boy were we ever pleased! \n\nWe started with the shaved fennel salad, it  had procuitto and also cooked pear a little cheese. It was perfect , super high quality and very fresh and  well presented. It was perfectly dressed, everything on the plate was delicious. Then on to the main event....\n\nWe ordered three pizzas, the margarita the shroom pizza and hog wild! Welcome to flavour city! All three pizza were so on point. They really go the extra mile and I can tell that whoever came up with their menu is some kind of food alchemist!  the seasoning on every pizza was so perfect it was uncanny!  The Hog wild pizza was the winner overall though! And get this it has broccoli rabb on it which makes it even better!!\n\nThese guys REALLY know what they are doing and I will be back let me tell you!!  A must try restaurant in Calgary for sure!!!
