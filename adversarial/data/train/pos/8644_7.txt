Yes! I may be getting over-excited about this sweet little coffee house based on the stark difference between it and everything I experience while staying on the strip, but even after a couple of days of consideration, I still am struck by how cool this join is. \n\nFirst off, they have coffee, and it's pretty decent. They also serve real food. Not just pastries, but real food, which always garners favor with me. I appreciate being offered something other than just the usual token pastry case when I'm getting cracked out on coffee. However I didn't try the food here so I can't say how good it is. But it exists, and alongside the decent coffee, authentic atmosphere and fast wifi, it completes a package. \n\nMore on the atmosphere - this joint sits in the Emergency Arts building, which houses a bunch of cool little gallery spaces harboring fun, funky art. Most weren't open when I visited but I did peek through some windows and could see myself wanting to return to see what the local hip arts community is up to. There's also a large selection of vinyl in the space, and you can peruse (and even play?) records there while you're sippin' on joe. Very cool. \n\nThe staff? Friendly. \n\nI'm super, duper glad I decamped from my situation at chain-coffee ground-zero and sought out some realness. For any visitors or locals looking to avoid the 'bux or the chaos just a few miles down Las Vegas Blvd, this is your spot. Grab coffee, post up, get things done, and feel good about the whole thing.
