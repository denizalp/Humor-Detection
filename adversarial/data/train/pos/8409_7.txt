Took a quick 11 ish-minute flight above the strip at around 10pm and it was epic. The view was beyond amazing and you can't really feel the heat when you're up there. We all had so much fun and our pilot, AJ, was super nice and informative! He points out all the new chill spots in Vegas for you and takes you right by the Stratosphere so you could look down and get a better perspective of the size. Looking forward to doing this again soon. Use Groupon to get a discount!
