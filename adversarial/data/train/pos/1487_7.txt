The Good\n- Locals praise this place, and rightfully so. You don't have to spend a fortune to get a great buffet. \n- All you can drink beer and wine is included. Holy Wayne Newton, Batman. I repeat, AYCD BEER AND WINE IS INCLUDED.  \n- Their dessert bar is lovely, but what makes it a real teacher's pet is that it includes a pretty solid selection of gelato AND a small espresso bar. They have Irish Cream and Amaretto for your lattes and mochas, in case you're not tipsy enough from the AYCD beer and wine. \n- Crab legs. They cut them down the middle for you, which is perfect for lazy people like me who love crab but don't like doing the work. \n- Plenty of parking.\n\nThe Bad\n- You need a car to get here. It's far from the strip. You could argue that this bullet point belongs in 'The Good' section.\n- Are there better buffets in Vegas? Yes. But not for this price. \n\nThe Ugly\n- There is an emotionless cyborg named Liliana from Poland that operates the gelato and espresso bar. Her demeanor will remind you of Arnold from Terminator 1, not T-2 when he begins to incorporate human behavior. If you're a fan of one word answers, she's your gal. I also think they save a ton on their electricity bill, as the frigid personality of this ice queen alone is enough to keep your gelato at temp.
