A whole bunch of people ordered food from here today for lunch.  And I said what the heck, I'll try it.  The lunch prices are decent.  $4.56 for a rice bowl.  I got the #1 almond chicken.  It smelled like butt at first, but after taking a bite I knew the smell was from the oil or pan it was cooked in.  Which is fine, cause it sure didn't taste like the smell.  LOL  Big portion of meat compared to the portion of rice.  So, very nice.  Cannot comment on the place cause I didn't pick it up.  But I will try it again for lunch.  Yum!
