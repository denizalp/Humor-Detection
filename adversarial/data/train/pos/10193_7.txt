This was the worst dining experience that I can remember.  It is rare that I walk out of a restaurant but this experience was so maddening that we just had to leave.  I have no problem paying high prices for quality but this restaurant is a huge ripoff.\n\nThe service was extremely slow.  We had 5 courses, one of them only being a small shot of sake and this took 3 hours.  The food was mediocre.  Grilled items were either overcooked or still cold.  There was nothing special about the nigiri, not even the presentation and the fish did not seem that fresh.  We could not stand to wait another couple more hours to finish the omakase menu and just left.\n\nTo charge these prices the kitchen really needs to step it up on quality and presentation.  And any restaurant that tries to be at this high caliber should put a little more effort into the front of the house as well.  Seating was not comfortable and  we were eating with disposable chopsticks that you would get from ordering takeout.
