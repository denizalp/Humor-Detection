Big things do come in small sizes!\n\nFirst impression of this shop was, ooooh tiny. Located off of Valley View behind Gold Coast, this B&M wasn't too hard to find. Plenty of parking space, and right on the corner of the plaza. \n\nWalked in and was immediately greeted by Felix or Alex. Sorry guys. They were working on a customer moving from an ego battery to a box an mechanical mod. Their glass display case was fully stocked with a wide variety of mech mods, RDAs, RBAs, drip tips, and accessories. Clones, but of good quality. They also carry wires, torches, and other vape goodies on their wall.\n\nBought\n\nTop cap wide bore drip tip\n2 30mil Iceman jueces - excellent menthol flavor\n1 30mil Bubblemint Gum - mmmmmm\n\nOriginally went for the wide bore dt, but after trying their juices, had to leave with some.They do a 80\/20 mix blend here that is awesome. 15mils are 50\/50 but can do max VG in the 30mil. Buy 2 get 1 free here peeps. Oh and need I say, house blend as well. Yaaaay! If you've read my previous B&M reviews, house blends are my fav. \n\nCustomer service here is above and beyond, informative, and very friendly. Ended up chilling for almost a good hour or so. It's always nice to go in a vape shop and be able to converse with other vapers casually and openly, whether your a beginner or a expert, and share the vape love. No disappointment here. Definitely on my top for vape shop.
