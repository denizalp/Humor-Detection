What is not to like about Yatai?  \n\nThe location is a bit unusual simply because the east side is not really known for this type of food.  However, I can see that this location may appeal to the east side or even the Henderson residents.  This is definitely a positive for me!\n\nTucked in the back of the shopping mall, you can easily miss it if you don't slow down.  Upon arrival on a Saturday around 7:30 p.m., we were the only one there.  Not a problem to us - this means better service! \n\nAfter being seated right away, our drink order was taken.  As a November special, $1 for a small hot sake or $2.50 for a large hot sake. What a deal!!!  The large hot sake was delicious.  We also ordered a pint size of the Sapporo on draft and some hot green tea.  (The green tea was from a tea bag and didn't taste like green tea at all.  Order the matcha if that may be an issue for you.)\n\nOur server explained the menu and the ordering sheet and left us to decide while she gets the drinks.  We had the chicken hearts, chicken gizzards, chicken thigh meat, beef tongue, calamari rings, grilled squid, mixed vegetable tempura, and wasabi tako.  I think that was it.  There was absolutely nothing to complain about any of the food we ordered.  The grilled items were delicious; it was not too \"char-y\" or burnt like some places do it.  All the deep fried items were perfect; the oil was very obviously fresh.  The batter on the fried foods was perfect; not too chunky not too light.  And the wasabi tako was fresh as it should be.  Lastly, the grilled squid was very tasty because you can really tell the squid flavor (in a good way) and not burnt.  Some places grilled the squid so much at such a high temperature that it becomes burnt and dry - not here at Yatai!\n\nAnd again, the service was fantastic.  Albeit we were the only table there, the server and chefs seem very eager to perform their jobs.  The chef actually came out and asked how everything was; I thought that was a nice touch. \n\nWe bought the $10 for $20 deal, so our bill came out to $53 plus the $10, so $63 before gratuity.  We had 3 hot sake and a couple beer and we reordered a couple of the grilled items, too.  So this is a very good price for this kind of service and quality of food. \n\nWe are definitely coming back and recommend this restaurant!!!
