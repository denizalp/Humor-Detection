You know...I have no idea why I eat crab legs in the first place. \nThe work necessary to attain the amount of usable sustenance, just makes me cry.\nBut my wife actually enjoys using those miniature forks, and digging the crab meat out of those things. \nFor me, it's torture\nHowever, this place has good service, good food (once you salvage it), and is well-lighted (which is good considering you have to work with tools in order to eat.)\nThe prices are reasonable, as well.\nMy only complaint about this particular place, was the incredibly loud music.\nWe were only one of four couples in there, and I could not hear my wife who was just sitting across the table from me (normally that's a good thing, but there was no TV for me to watch, as is the usual routine.)\nBut here is where they lose the star: We asked them if they could possibly turn down the music a little (keep in mind that it was intensely loud), and they said that they could not.\nThe waitress explained as to why not, but I could not hear her explanation due to the loud music.\nMaybe it's just me, but when I eat lunch in a restaurant, not being able to converse at the table, doesn't make a whole lot of sense.
