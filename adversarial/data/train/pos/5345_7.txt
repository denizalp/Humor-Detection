Shhhhhhhhhhhhh!\n\nCan you keep a secret? I sure can't and by the looks of things neither can the other 2137 Yelpers who reviewed Secret Pizza.\n\nIt's such a secret that it's not listed in The Cosmopolitan Casino directory and there is no restaurant sign with the name. So how does one find such a place? There's three options: \n1. Yelp \n2. Ask customer service\n3. I'll tell you the secret! It's located on the 3rd floor of The Cosmopolitan between Milo's and Blue Ribbon Sushi.
