\"Fake\" (or rather condescending) service from the \"Service Manager\"...and he didn't even acknowledge me when I asked the status of my car (uh, more like IGNORE). Ended every sentence with an impolite \"No ma'am\" or \"Yes, ma'am\"... ya get the scenario. Basically, the guy was a real JERK.\n\nThey couldn't even figure out HOW to fix my car, even when I TOLD them what was wrong with it ( had been diagnosed at the Dealership). Two guys were sitting there staring at the computer (as if it was going to magically speak to them). At least they didn't charge me, but what a waste of time waiting for 90 minutes....
