Do not choose this Hotel if you want to have a room when you get in town. I called the night before to check my reservation and they did not have me in the system nor did hey have a room to offer for their mistake. They were unapologetic and did not offer any other room as a replacement. The person whom answered the phone was confusing and did not know what she was doing! I will not recommend this place to anyone!!!! I would have a better chance at getting a room in the girls dormitory.
