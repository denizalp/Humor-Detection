Siri recommended this place to us when we were visiting Peoria!! It's easily accessible and in the mall. Very clean and nice and they have glass art by \"new glass company\". It's a chain but is family owned. Really cute dishes and mugs. The guy behind the counter was super awesome and accommodating with our complicated order! The chocolate croissant is amazing and so are their breads. Love that they have samples set out! Definitely will be back
