Oh Gino! Why did you leave me!\n\nI was only able to experience your lovely pizza once, but oh how I miss you.\n\nI deeply miss the excessive heap of crust, the copious amount of cheese, and the tremendous layer of tomato sauce, which you so wonderfully crafted. \n\nDeep dish pizza is now a pastime in Madison, something on which I nostalgically reflect. \n\nThe Chicagoan in me deliciously craves this concoction that is currently nonexistent in this here county, much to my chagrin. \n\nPlease come back.
