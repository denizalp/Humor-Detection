This used to be an exceptional location for a morning drink fix. Since changing owners, the quality has started on a steady decline. \n\nThe once fresh coffee is stale and cool. \nI don't know if they are selling less or not changing it as often but it isn't as good. \n\nThe one immaculate soda fountain area is now sticky and messy like every other gas station convince store. \n\nThe fact you have to ask someone to choose your hot dog for you is also weird. I'm so disappointed I wanted to give it one star but since there is no other convenient drink stop for me, I'm adding the extra star as hope for a brighter tomorrow.
