\"Dude, are we wearing body glitter again??\"\n\nOh damn - sad to say, this sentence might have been uttered this weekend....\n\nAnd it's not like I am the body glitter type of guy (yes, they exist...just not one of them) - but when we were in Argentina in January, we accidentally failed to read the entire description of a purchased tube of sunscreen that contained \"pigmentos illuminosos\"....and we found out after application, on the streets of Buenos Aires that...umm....we had gold flecks on our arms, cheeks, pretty much everywhere.  Good laughs ensued, and before our return,  that tube got lost - or so I thought.\n\nAnd here we were, at the pool at Mandalay this weekend- and the sentence rightfully gets uttered.  More gold glitter than a second grader's take home assignment.....\n\nBut thank god it was at Mandalay, because trust me, we didn't stick out amongst the fabulousness surrounding us.  At $700 a day for cabanas, and $12 a pop for small frozen drinks, this place definitely weeds out the riff raff - and it makes for a fun time just hanging out, in the wave pool, the lazy river, or anywhere around the 'beach' - watching women wearing bikinis and stilettos maneuvering the sandy paths and gravel - and while they have an exclusive area or two, it doesn't exclude us normal folk from having a good time.\n\nJust make sure you are a guest, and head there early to get a good spot - then sit back, apply your (non-glittered) lotion, and soak it all in. it's the best pool I have seen in awhile.
