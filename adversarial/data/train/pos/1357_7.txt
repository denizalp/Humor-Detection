Danielle is awesome.  She's so friendly and personable that you *almost* won't notice she's removing hair from your business area (or wherever). She's very professional and experienced, and made me feel very comfortable. I highly recommend making an appointment and checking out Bloom & Clover for yourself. \n\nThe space looks great.  Modern and clean but comfortable.
