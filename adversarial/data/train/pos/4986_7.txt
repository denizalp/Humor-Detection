After all these years, I finally came and tried this establishment.  The parking spaces were limited.  Watch where you park!   \n\nA long line was already out the door waiting for a table. Why are brunch places always so busy?  The decor reminded me of Glendale's antique shops. They have a bunch of baskets hanging and other random items surrounded the restaurant. Its interesting decor. \n\nUpon entering the restaurant, there was a strong burnt odor in the dining area.  I'm assuming their vents weren't working. \n\nI had the Country Breakfast with 2 eggs, biscuits & gravy, and fried potatoes. The biscuits & gravy didn't taste fresh and homemade. Fried potatoes were basically scorched.  They were tasteless and hard.  It helped when you sprinkle with plenty of black peppers.\n\nThe staff was efficient and friendly.  I love a place still give out free warm muffins. I would return just to order the basket of muffins. It was absolutely delicious.
