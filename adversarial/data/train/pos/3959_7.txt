After a long morning of digging through the bins at the Goodwill Outlet my stomach was talking to me and seemed to be telling me that it couldn't wait the 15 minutes it would take to get home but that I would need to find a closer option. So I did what any respectable hungry person would do in that situation.....I opened up my Yelp! app and did a nearby restaurant search...Ooooh what is this?! A po'boy spot?! But where? and why had I never spotted it before ( I would later find out because it has only been open for 3 months). It was an off time of day, 4pm, so I rang em' up to check that they weren't just a lunch spot (yelp didn't have their hours listed). The friendly voice on the end of the line assured me that they were open until 8pm. Yessss. \n\nAlready having been hooked by eying a pic of the oyster po'boy I knew this was what I was getting. But the offer to \" You Buy We Fry\" for the various fresh fish was also a very tempting option for future visits. You get several options for the fry of the oyster. Cajun, S&P and regular I believe were the options. Then you can choose po'boy sauce or mayo as a sauce. I chose cajun and the po'boy sauce. Duh. The very enthusiastic girl behind the counter assured me that the combo I chose was also her favorite. I almost got one of the made-in-house sides, green beans perhaps, until I was informed that the sandwich was HUGE. Next time.\n\nThe size was indeed over ample, and the taste was on point. Perfectly seasoned fry on the oyster, not to mention a generous amount of the plump suckers, 8 If I am not mistaken. The bread was great as well, perfect balance of soft and chewy. It could have easily been split between two people, but not being one to cower away from a challenge, I finished the entire thing solo. However, not without regrets and the need for a nap.. zzzzzzzz
