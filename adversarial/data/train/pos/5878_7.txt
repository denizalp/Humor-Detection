07\/27\/11\n\nTook Mom for her first taste of Gelato Spot's frozen delights.  Despite my informing her that she could sample as much as she'd like, which cute Stephen echoed back from behind the counter, she refused to try any more after five (mango, raspberry, coffee, pistachio, chocolate-fudge-brownie).  Owner (sorry, he didn't give me his name) also came out to help me w\/ samples, and I decided I was going to have a $6 banana split.  \"How many scoops of gelato do I get,\" I asked him, and he sheepishly said, \"Oh, I don't know... I'm only the owner, ha ha, but let me find out!\"  So cute!  :)  As I paced back and forth, surveying the menu boards and the flavor cases for my selections, owner said \"You're going to love whatever you decide upon, I can tell!\"  Well, you can imagine my disappointment then when Stephen later informed me that the store was out of bananas!  I even said I'd be willing to wait until someone comes back w\/ a supply of bananas, but this, I was told, was not going to happen, and THAT is the reason I couldn't make this a four-star review.  \n\nHad I been able to order the banana split, I would've also tried a nice cuppa Giuseppe, but I settled on getting the three gelato flavors we wanted two-ways: in a $5 gelato sundae (two scoops, mango and regular chocolate-- Mom thought the fudge variety was too sweet to get a whole scoop of) and a $5 brownie sundae (single scoop of coffee).  Stephen was nice enough to check for corn syrup-free labels and found a couple I could try-- the hard-shell chocolate and the caramel.  Gelato Spot's mango sorbet is my new fave (what, I favor a sorbet over cream-based gelato??) and was our pick out of what we had this afternoon, w\/ the regular chocolate being the wrong choice over the chocolate-fudge-brownie.  \n\nThanks to the nice stranger who gave me his untouched chocolate-banana shake leftovers to sample.  No thanks to the same stranger for using up all of the bananas! :(  LOL\n\nGelato Spot is upgrading!  For the last couple of months, they've added more seating, focused on offering more toppings to add on the gelatos (bad idea, I think... yes, this coming from someone who just tried to order a banana split from a gelato shop!; toppings bar will be up and running in two or three weeks, I'm told), and pizzas!  Yes, you read correctly-- G-Spot started serving pizzas two weeks ago!  Text ITALY to 30364 for $3 off pizzas, and COFFEE for $1 off coffees.\n\nTry the mango, or a chocolate-banana shake (so delicious!!), and be sure to say yes to roasted almonds when they ask if you want nuts on your sundae- so good!  :)\n\nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/qMNgGd-9gsQDjalAquj4dQ?select=FZiENC5YgzIdnSBYUa-sdA\nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/qMNgGd-9gsQDjalAquj4dQ?select=MCN1EoUkTlCsh6wp7eASGw
