You know I have to stop into anyplace that claims it's a factory of milkshakes. Since I have had more milkshakes during my time in Pennsylvania more than I have since 2005, I had to try this one. It was in a quaint little storefront on the South Side right on Carson. When you walk in, you're met with a whole long display of chocolates. Then near the back, is the ice cream. You get a menu and you can have your shakes \"thick\" or \"suck your brains out.\" I normally would get the latter, but just decided to go for a thick coffee shake. My friend got the cherry. I think they were about $4 each and we sat down and drank our shakes at one of the two tables they had there. It's really reminiscent of old soda shops. Or what I think would be old soda shops, if I were alive at that time. So it's probably not. But it's still really cute.
