Front desk wrote down the wrong room information on our room key packet. She always said the wrong room number too. woke up the guest who was staying in what we thought was our room. No apologies or (2) craps given when we called asking what was going on. She could of atleast sound apologetic but no, just brushed off and gave us the right number. Like it happens on a daily basis. Def going back to the mandaley our next trip around. Never had these issues when we stay there.\n\nDay two - bathroom lights blew up when I tried turning the lights on after a quick shock. What the hell?!?.
