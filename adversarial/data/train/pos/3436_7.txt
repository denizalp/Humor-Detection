Can someone help me here? \n\nHave I missed the point of Poutine completely?\n\nI operate under the assumption that Poutine is supposed to be: French Fries covered in gravy and topped with cheese curds. Served on a plate, or some such horizontal vessel that allows the fries to maintain a relative amount of crispiness while being soaked just a wee bit with the gravy and the cheese curds that are nestled in the nooks and crannies between the fries. Thus maintaining optimal crispiness (otherwise, why are they even deep fried), and contrasting textures.\n\nAm I wrong? Or do I just not \"get\" Poutine?\n\nOr is Smoke's bastardizing what the world believes Poutine is?\n\nWhile I love creative toppings, I beg one to consider not just the flavour but the texture of the Poutine. Dill pickles cut in strips are soggy and make the fries soggy. Smoked Meat is floppy and adds no texture. And the vertical box traps the steam inside and makes the fries even soggier, so that all I'm left with after many drinks at the bar, is a cardboard box stuffed with something that makes me wonder if I threw up my pre-bar dinner and am now going to eat it.\n\nTwo stars for flavour, if you can get past the idea of eating your own vomit. Cuz it's not really vomit, although it looks like it. And the staff are more than patient and friendly with all the drunkards.\n\nThankfully, booze was invented before Poutine.
