SkinnyFATS is one of my favorite places to get my grub on after working out. I can be in my gym clothes and still get treated with dignity. How dramatic! But seriously, not only is their food good but the service is the best in town. This might even be the first review I write starting with the service first and food second.\n\nAs soon as you make your way to the order counter, there's always a big bright smile waiting for you. And I remember when they first opened, we were guinea pigs for menu items they were testing out and they were very receptive to feedback. My friends and family have been coming here every week after the gym since then...sometimes, even more that some employees already know what I'm about to order. I appreciate people who remember little things - it shows that they pay attention and care enough. That or I'm just very predictable.\n\nMoving on to their food...they have a \"skinny\" side and a \"happy\" side on the menu. \"Skinny\" would be the healthier options, and \"happy\" includes fried, rich, or sweet options. I've tried items from both sides and I haven't had anything I didn't like. A list of what I normally get:\n\nZucc It (spiralized zucchini with steak, eggplant, squash, peppers, mushrooms and arrabiatta sauce)\nCluck Moo \nToo Nuts\nCaulifire (cauliflower Buffalo style)\nTruffle Fries\nBalls 2.0 (think arancini)\nBuff Chix (buffalo chicken tenders with a side of truffle fries)\nSlow Boat to China\nSmoke in a Bowl\nNaked Chix\nMore Cow Bowl\nCharlie Brownie (Nutella, strawberry, banana, froyo, almond milk shake)\nCinnutella (cinnamon-sugar French toast with spiced Nutella and orange syrup)\n\nIt gets real busy around 12-1pm and 6-7:30pm. We try to come here at odd times to avoid the crowd.
