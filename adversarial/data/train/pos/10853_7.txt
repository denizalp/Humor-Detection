Ok worse dining exp so far ordered threw menunu a grub hub like site.. Total was $60 ! so for that price I am expecting good stuff right, wrong very disappointed I was thinking quality like Raku or something however really shocked. \n\nCucumber salad -While thinking to myself well hoping it would of been more like a traditional kim chee style cucumber salad it wasn't very bland more like southern cucumber salad had about two bites thats about it tossed it out witch was sad it had some type of crab like thing on top witch made it hard to eat. \n\nGyoza - What I was looking forward to was cold had to re heat kinda disappointing having to re heat the food that should of been hot. \n\nMeat dish- I apologize for not remembering the name but it was HORRIBLE. !! The meat was super grisly, hard to eat, and smelled of flat top or cooking device.  \n\n\nI had deep fried roll - witch to me just had panko on top lightly crusted the bottom of the roll was not breaded. The rice was good thankfully not hard. \n\nThe dessert was the biggest disappointment - While the idea of a apple filled egg roll  like dessert intrigued my mind it fell threw on execution the ice cream was mixed into the dish and melted I MEAN COMPLETELY MELTED INTO THE DISH, Thus voiding the crispy texture of the actual dish. I was looking forward to this dish. I think since we live in dessert area I am from Phoenix too that the best way to carry ice cream is individually to avoid this process either in a smaller container and let the person place it on its own.  \n\nI really wanted to like this place I really did. However I just left a complaint with menunu and will follow threw hopefully to work out a refund. I would expect quality like this at a denny's rather the sushi joint. \n\nMeh sadly disappointing.
