I love the Bikini Lounge.  For those out there that know me, you might find this hard to believe, because I typically require a modicum of ambiance, attentiveness from waitstaff, and clean bathrooms from the places that I frequent.\n\nAnd Bikini Lounge provides absolutely NONE of this!  But for whatever reason it works, and I don't wind up wanting to run out the door and jump in a vat of antibacterial solution...go figure.\n\nBikini Lounge is the epitome of a dirty dive bar, complete with shady Grand Ave location, bitchy bar staff that looks like they want to cut you if you make the cardinal mistake of trying to pay with a credit card, and on the positive, a kickass jukebox.\n\nI was in there Friday night after a terribly stressful day and proceeded to knock back about 5 small pitchers of Bud Light by myself, and embarrass myself later on in the night, you know, typical Friday.\n\nBut what was atypical was the fact that I spent under $20 and I even bought a couple rounds for friends!!!  Now this is what I call a recession-friendly drinking establishment,,,\n\nI really ended up digging the fact that no one there, staff or patron, gave a shit about me and how I was doing.  Strange, i know.  It was surprisingly liberating not having to worry about other people around me because NO ONE there was worried about you.\n\nCall me crazy, but I dug it, and I will totally be back.
