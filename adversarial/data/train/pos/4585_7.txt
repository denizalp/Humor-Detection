I shop local... I swear I do!\n\nBut I also was recently allowed back into Scottsdale Fashion Square (after the flashmob a year ago), and I had a Sephora giftcard.  So I admit, I did go to this big box store recently... Don't tell anyone,  but I actually liked it.  \n\nI don't wear a ton of makeup, but shopping at Sephora almost makes me want to wear more.  There are so many fun colors, packages, products galore!  I walked out with an eyeliner, a lipliner, and some Philosphy gift packs (I heart Philosophy).\n\nI definitely could have done more damage, but I went during the holiday craze and this place was a zoo!  With good reason - Sephora offers something for everyone, from cute stocking stuffers to bigger ticket items like high end cosmetics, skincare, hairdryers, etc... There were plenty of helpful employees working and despite long lines at checkout, they went pretty quickly.\n\nBottom line - I try to shop local whenever possible but every now and then I make an exception and hit up a chain... I'll likely continue to go to Sephora for cosmetic, fragrance, bath products and gifts. You can't go wrong there even though it's not the yelpiest!
