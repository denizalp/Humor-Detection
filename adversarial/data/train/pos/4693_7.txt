NOW OPEN!  Good news for anyone in the Kincora, Evanston, or boonie area like those.  Anytime Fitness is a nice, new gym that is accepting new members all the time.\n\nThe prices of the memberships at this gym are pretty standard and a little too expensive for me.  I just wish that a gym would open up where I can pay $20\/month to work out.  I know... that's ridiculous!  \n\nThe good thing about Anytime is that, since it's so new, the place looks modern and fresh, and all the equipment is new and therefore in mint condition.\n\nIf you're tired of the usual World Health Club or YMCA gyms then give Anytime a shot.  I'm still too lazy (and cheap) to actually buy a membership, but drop-in fees are pretty decent and I don't mind doing that.
