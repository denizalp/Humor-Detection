SKIP IT. It was nothing to rave about. Everything is fried and gross. Service was terrible. I will not go back. I will say, the inside d√©cor is nicely done. I just expected more. I would rather spend my money at Texas Roadhouse. \n\nI ordered the chicken ceasar pasta salad - it was terrible. Friends ordered burger - It was ok. Just blah. Not for me.
