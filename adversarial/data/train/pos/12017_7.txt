I found this spot just before you enter concourse D&E.  The printers were out (strike) and then I stood for a few minutes before they realized my order fell through the cracks (strike 2).  The payoff was a large drink versus he medium that I ordered (score!).  I got the protein special - PB and banana.  As I reviewed the chart during my longer than expected wait, I came to the realization that my drink is the highest calorie drink.  Good news, it taste good and filled me up, the perfect combo of peanut butter and banana.
