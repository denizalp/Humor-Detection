To be honest I didn't expect to find a museum for mustard, let alone in the Midwest, right here in Wisconsin Middleton area! The annual mustard festival organized by the museum is what caught my attention. It takes place every first Saturday of August. \n\nBack to the museum, they offer about everything type of mustard you can ever imagine. Sweet ones, salty ones, spicy ones, etc. If you are like me and have always thought mustard comes with the strong horse radish aftertaste, their selection here will prove you wrong. I have tried fruit-based mustard that are indistinguishable from jams *woots*\n\nOn the other extreme I found the 'HIT and RUN', which is an extremely hot and spicy mustard guaranteed to make you, as its name implies, RUN ~~\n\nThe museum encourages visitors to sample however many mustard you are interested in trying. They are also good at giving suggestions as to how to pair your favorite mustard with your favorite foods. \n\nIn the exhibition area, they have a huge display of the different mustard from different countries all over the world. Even if you are not a huge fan of mustard, give this museum a visit and it will probably swing your perception of mustard 180 degrees around.
