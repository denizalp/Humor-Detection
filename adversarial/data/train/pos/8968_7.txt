The most expensive buffet I've ever been to and probably will ever go to rests at the steakhouse inside Bally's Resort and Casino.\n\nThis brunch is BALLIN'!!! To start off you have to make reservations in advance and they only open Sunday for brunch. Be warned: it's $85 per person. That's right, that wasn't a typo. However, with that hefty price tag comes some very extravagant perks as you'll see. When you first arrive if you're table is not yet ready, enjoy some complimentary champagne\/bloody mary's while you wait. When you do get seated you're transported back to old school Vegas. The walls are lined with old photos of Elvis, Rat Pack, etc.  The waiters are fully suited up and look like they can be your butler for the next couple of hours. Great, nostalgic ambiance for some. \n\nAs for the food and drink, prepare to be astonished. The meal comes with unlimited champagne and I put this to the test with round after round of mimosas. The food well, is just super over the top in excess of anything you might expect. Lobster tails, crab legs, caviar, fresh oysters, oysters rockafeller, prime rib, rack of lamb, chilean sea bass, sashimi, dragonfruit, crepe station (I had bananas foster), oh and did I mention CAVIAR, probably but it's worth mentioning twice. \n\nI'm not sure how often I'd come back but I'm really glad I got to experience it at least once before I died. I died. Nomnom.
