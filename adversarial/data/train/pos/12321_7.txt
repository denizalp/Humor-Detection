Very clean place with polite older guys.. Wasn't sure if these guys would be able to do a fade.. Also they cost more than the normal Barber shops too.. Nonetheless I gave it a crack.. I was right they don't know how to give a good fade.. Can't be mean.. If I was just looking for a regular cut I would probably still come! But for now ill look like Burt from Sesame Street for a couple of weeks!
