Been here twice before.\n\nOwner is super sweet, funny, and outgoing. Had a great time making conversation and jokes with him while ordering and waiting for my delicious frozen goodness. Loved his enthusiasm in explaining the way things worked to my friends that haven't been there before. He was keen on making sure they knew how much of a healthier and better alternative this was to regular ice cream, all natural and fresh ingredients, and tastes just as amazing as any other old ice cream\n\nFirst time  I came I think I tried the red bean and green tea both with whole milk which were not bad.\n\nThe second time I came, I got the whole milk with strawberry and cheesecake bites and he topped it off with fresh strawberries, none of that artificial crap, to add even more healthiness and flavor to my selection. This is one of the best combinations guys believe me. I get something similar at cold stones too.\n\nPretty pricey,but entertaining and interesting concept in making ice cream by pounding it intensely in front of customers. Give it a try its at least worth the experience once.
