I like this small tea shop, it's small though. \n\nIt's one of the few places in the area, where you could grab a quick salad or sandwich, or meet with some friends for a drink. There's not much else walking distance from here in this genre (aside from 2nd cup). \n\nThey've got hot teas, bubble tea and serve coffee as well. \nMy only thing about the place, is that's its tiny and I feel like a giant walking in there with my yoga bag.
