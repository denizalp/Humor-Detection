Twelve hours ago, I was kidnapped by friends and swept away to an Eastern European Netherworld for a night of metallic mischief. \n\nAn underground playland awash in red, purple, and violet light like a German brothel, Gooski's is a Hessian, punk-rock barrelhouse where bands such as Liquified Guts, Radium Girls, No Reason To Live, and edhochuli entertain small cults of devotees. \n\nLocated in Polish Hill, a land of Old World charms, a subversive Unholy Saturday mass was taking place. \n\nA bartender who resembled a time-tossed Viking passed pierogi and Old Bay wings to other patrons who in turn passed them off to me as if we were on a Satanic version of \"The Waltons\" during a family dinner scene. When I handed a twenty dollar bill to the massive Nordic server, some sour cream accidentally smeared onto the cash, only for Hagar The Affable to laugh heartily at my foible. \n\nA fire-haired fairy princess with the face of a model and the tattooed body of a L.A. vampire walked up to me and smiled, revealing a chipped front tooth as she eagerly recounted the story behind her dental mishap. \n\nAs Liquified Guts tore into their set, an obese, jolly concertgoer took turns putting his fellow headbangers onto his shoulders, gleefully catching and dizzying them in the \"airplane spin,\" a pro wrestling maneuver from yesteryear.\n\nA bearded young man handed me a PBR after he saw that I had on an Amon Amarth t-shirt. \"I been comin' here since I was a kid,\" he told me. \n\nA veteran rockdog with long, alabaster locks and a hippy's headband told me tales of glory after I pointed out the Hawkwind patch on his denim-n-leather vest. \n\nI did not know any of these folks, yet I felt as if they had known me since high school.  \n\nCigarette smoke didn't faze me. People's shoulders bumped into mine as I passed back and forth through the thin corridor that leads to the stage, the gentle, jovial collisions acting as catalysts for conversations with absolute strangers. \n\nGraffiti decorates the walls along with an iconic picture of Johnny Cash flipping off the world. \n\nExquisite, plump, buttery packets of dough, cheese, and potato and dead-on crispy, succulent chicken limbs were savored. \n\nNecks were sprained. Backs were slapped. Ears hummed like tuning forks. \n\nFar from and far more than the typical sanitized concert experience, it was a few hours of worship and camaraderie for the freaks and night creatures, Gooski's being their Great Refuge in the slopes of the East End. \n\nThe joyfully subterranean realm that is Gooski's will not be appealing to everyone, but then again, if it was, it would no longer be subterranean.\n\nP.S. If I had a complaint, it would be due to the narrow hallway, which made it difficult for the musicians to shuttle their equipment through. A backdoor near the stage would be great for that sort of thing if possible.
