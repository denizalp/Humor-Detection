Chicky chicky bok bok, chicky chicky. Oh how I love me some roasted chicken. Pio Pio is a clean restaurant with great staff and excellent portions. \n\nWhile rotisserie chicken is good no matter how it's prepared, there wasn't a distinct \"Peruvian\" flavor. Maybe I'm ignorant (don't answer that please), but  it just tasted like any other roasted chicken with herbs and spices. Good nonetheless. \n\nSweet plaintains; well they're plantians no matter how you slice em. Fried yucca was just that, yummy in my tummy fried yucca. Rice and beans were solid but what Pio Pio does best are the dipping sauces. \n\nI don't know how to describe them but I'm guessing one is a vinegar based garlic cream sauce and the second I can't even put my finger on. To be honest, I don't really care, it was good that's all I know. It's like going to a foreign country or eating foreign food. If it looks like grasshopper, crunches like grasshopper, well it just might be grasshopper! Don't ask, don't tell, just eat it if it's yummy!
