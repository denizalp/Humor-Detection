G.H.E.T.T.O.\n\nSadly, this was the 1st place in Vegas that I drank at after I turned 21 when I went on a road trip to Vegas the weekend after my 21st birthday on Labor Day weekend.  Drank at some bar on the 2nd floor while watching a college football game and waiting for my family to be done in the carnival game room.  Got carded and everything.  Hoorah!\n\nPlayed some games, won some prizes, gave some to my future gf (now ex) when I got back home, and gave the rest to my little sister.\n\nThat new mini-amusement park they added here that they charge admission to is HELLA GHETTO!  Makes this Circus Circus more ghetto than the one up in Reno.\n\nThis place is really run down and old like some of the older Las Vegas hotels that are still around.\n\nThere's no point in coming to this Circus Circus in Vegas unless you have kids and had to bring them with you to Vegas.
