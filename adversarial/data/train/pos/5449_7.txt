Greens is my new favourite vegetarian Chinese restaurant. They used to be Full Moon Vegetarian but they changed owners and renovated last year and it's been a huge improvement!\n\nThey serve a lot of 'traditional' chinese food dishes that you might get at meat-serving Chinese restaurants such as sweet 'n sour chicken balls. I never really ate meat so this has given me a chance to try these dishes.\n\nThe best dish on the menu is far and away the Lemon Chicken(order with a side of rice). The sweet lemon sauce is so good on the crispy fried batter. If you get a soup, expect it to be huge. A medium is only $3.99, which is crazy ridiculous cheap.  \n\nPretty much everything is very affordable and the portions size are really good. \n\nIt's a great place for groups too. I once had 30 people here for a dinner and sharing dishes was great and very affordable. I shared with about 7 people sitting near me and we had each ordered a dish, plus a soup and the total came to $11 with tax and tip per person.\n\nIf you haven't tried Greens, give it a shot.
