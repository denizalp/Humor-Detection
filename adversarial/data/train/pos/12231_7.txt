I really don't want to drop a 2 star on this place as it's cute on the inside and I know they have a lot of potential.  It's like stepping in to your 94 year old neighbours house and sitting down to a nice brunch or breakfast.  The only difference here is, your 94 year old neighbour could probably out cook a set of eggs better than any of the chefs at Hello Darling.\n\nImma start off first by saying, please invest in Menus guys.  It's cool you have all the items on your menu written on the black board in the middle of the restaurant, but when there's a crowd of people all looking at it at the same time, it just causes chaos and confusion.  Not only for the customers, but for the servers too.  There was only one poor girl working the entire restaurant, and on top of the slew of orders she got wrong for our table, our food came out mad late.  I'm talking, you gotta make excuses to your boss for coming back from lunch 2 hours late kinda deal.  It's aight, my cat is sick and I had a dentist appointment knowmsayin?\n\nOverall this place deserves a 1 star for the food because my quesadilla was probably the weakest I've ever had, but imma give it two for the server who was working it hard.  I hate to say this, but Goodbye Darling!
