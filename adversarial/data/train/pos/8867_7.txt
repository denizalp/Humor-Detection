This place was so much fun to eat at! Beautiful view of the Bellagio fountains at night- which does its fountain show every 15 minutes. Most of the seats are geared to give a good view- so already a hit with the ambiance, right off the bat.\nWe walked in on a Thursday night without a reservation, and even though they were busy, we got seated within 5 minutes.\nThe food was also really amazing. It's French (go figure), and upscale. Service was great too (I ordered a drink and didn't like it, they replaced it with a good wine instead) and very attentive. \nWe got the scallop appetizer, while admittedly it was small, it was delicious and perfectly seasoned and seared. We each got an entree- and neither disappointed. \nNext time I visit Vegas, I'll be sure to come here again!
