Amazing flight to Seattle, Washington. \n\nAlaska Airlines boards at Terminal 3, it was my first time in Terminal 3! It was pretty smooth to get inside. We came at like 6am so it wasn't as busy as it probably gets but they did have only 2 lines open at the security check in. \n\nThe staff was very nice. The flight was pretty smooth. There was a bit of turbulence on our way back to Vegas but I think that's pretty normal. \n\nThe snack boxes are my favorite. I had ordered some white wine and a box of goodies which were only 7$. If u look at my picture it does come with a lot of snacks which I was surprised about. Certain flights they did offer actual food like French Toast or teriyaki bowls but I think our flight was too short for them to offer that. \n\nOn our way back to Vegas we had a pleasure of actually sitting next to a pilot for Alaska Airlines but he was on a trip to Vegas. We were just making small talk and he knew a lot about the airlines so we questioned if he worked with them and he turned out to be one of the pilots! So he was our unofficial tour guide while we were in the air. How awesome! \n\nOverall great experience will defiantly fly with them again and even consider about signing up for their rewards credit card!
