So, I accidentally went to Light Bistro for happy hour drinks and I didn't eat anything. From then on I labeled Light Bistro as a place to drink good wine for cheap, HH prices. Horrible mistake. \n\nLight Bistro has delicious food and a damn-good-n-cheap lunch to die for. My ignorance about this glorious resto has cost me months and months of living so close and taking advantage of their glorious menu. Seriously...How do they do gourmet, creative and upscale on the cheap? \n\nLunch isn't too busy, you get seated quickly, served like you're at a 5 star restaurant and you don't have a heart attack when you see the bill. I had a chop salad this time around, but I can't wait to come back and try all the other sandwiches. It took all my self-control not to get a burger or the grilled cheese. And those fries... gimme those crunchy pieces of potatoey goodness. Oh, and don't forget your Light Bistro lunch punch-card to fill up for a free one on them!\n\nThe dinner menu is definitely on my radar for exploration. I can't even image how tasty it would be if the lunch menu made me drool that much... \n\nLight Bistro may give off that up-ity vibe from the outside, but it really is a great, down-to-earth spot to not only feast, but imbibe as well. And did you know they sell wine to go? Oh hells yea!
