First, I wasn't certain when they closed, so I called them. They didn't answer.\n\nThen, I unknowingly arrived only 10 minutes before closing. Sorry, I didn't know. I was in the store for quite awhile before I got help.\n\nThere was one other customer, and two staff, and one was very busy with the one customer, meaning I should have had the attention of the other girl. Alas, it was not to be. The other girl didn't even acknowledge my presence. I picked out 5 different shoes and stood in the nearly empty store like an idiot. The girl who wasn't helping anyone made herself appear busy by arranging the shelves, or...whatever.\n\nShe WALKED BY ME as I stood there with 5 half-pairs of shoes in hand, just waiting to be helped. I do not understand what would motivate this sort of behaviour. I understand you want to go home, but guess what? You can't leave until the customers leave!\n\nEventually, the busy girl helped me and the other customer at the same time. The other girl didn't say a word to me except to say goodnight as she locked the door behind me.\n\nMaybe she was under some sort of training? I don't know, but I have never felt so unappreciated as a customer.\n\nOne extra star for carrying what I needed in my size, but seriously. Fire the girl.
