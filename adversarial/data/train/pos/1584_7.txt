Better lunch prices than the fast food chains.\nI've been coming here for years.  Actually, back in the day when I still lived on this side of town, I ate here 3-6 times per week.  My favs include the antipasto salad, steak special + jalapenos sub, and fried mushrooms.  You can't beat the 2 slice lunch special for like 4 bucks i think. \nThe pizza &  wing special is classic.  \nFamily owned by Italian guys with humor.  Sheck 'em out!\n\nI wish they had one of these on the Eastside and then I wouldn't have 2 wonder what I'm having 4 dinner everynite.     ;' (
