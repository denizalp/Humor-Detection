I enjoyed this place - I think. I was somewhat inebriated by the time we got here. I will try to remember the details... We mostly hung out on the back patio, which has it's own bar and restroom (outhouse). I mostly remember the arm wrestling machine and the drinks being really cheap... I could be wrong and just mixed this up with another bar... reading this review could be a waste of your time.
