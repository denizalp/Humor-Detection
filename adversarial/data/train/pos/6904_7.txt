First of all I have flagged JT's message, and I hope Yelp removes it. Second, I don't eat way too much nor like a \"champ\", and I am not dumb. I have been to several other Mongolian grills, and I have never had to \"press down\" my vegetables. A better solution to this problem, as I suggested, would be to give a slightly bigger bowl. As for the menus, they were not useful like JT had mentioned, so really they didn't need to sit on my table the whole time. Furthermore, maybe I wanted to look at the drink menu, even though our server did not ask us what we would like to drink. Which in my opinion is pretty standard at a sit down restaurant.  \n\n\"I don't know where Allison has been to eat but normally you give your bowl to the person that cooks it and they give it back on a plate.\" \n\nIn response to this portion of the comment... at this particular restaurant they do not give your food back on a plate... it came back in a bowl, a much larger bowl than the one I had originally \"filled up\" (without pressing the veggies down). Maybe this JT gentleman has not been to this particular restaurant. \n\nI rated this two stars, or as yelp says, \"Meh. I've experienced better\", which I am comparing this one too. I was rating the overall experience not the quality of my food. Yelp serves as a place to review places based on your personal opinion not to name call or pick on an individual person. For those of you who might not be able to see JT's original comment, it wasn't helpful or accurate (and why did he keep saying my name?, that was odd). You didn't miss out on anything of importance from that guy. Thanks! : )
