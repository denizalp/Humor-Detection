Groan, moan, sigh. We came here on a Sat night and the restaurant was okay busy but extremely under staffed. \nWe were seated asked by one waitress what we wanted to order. When we said we needed more time to look at the menu, she promptly disappeared. I mean, literally. We never say her back in the dining room again. \nThere was one sushi chef and one waitress for the whole place. Tick tock, tick tock. It took over 30 mins to order and prob even longer to get our food. \nThe worst part was the waitress was pretty rude to us until she saw me check in on Yelp. Instantaneously she was much friendlier and nicer to us.  Pretty suspect!\nWe still left her a decent tip cause anyone can have an off night . . . But not sure we will be back- the food?  Who can remember- we dozed off while waiting for it!
