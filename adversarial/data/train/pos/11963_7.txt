I found this place on Yelp while visiting downtown Charlotte and figured I'd give it a shot for a quick lunch. I had no idea it was in a hotel! It's a cute restaurant with a comfortable, modern atmosphere. However, on a Saturday afternoon I expected there to be more than ONE person working. Our server was also running the bar, and while he was super nice.. he couldn't help but be a bit slow since he had zero help. \n\nThe menu is very, very limited.. and a bit pricey (but I'd expect that at a hotel restaurant.) My boyfriend and I each ordered burgers and a soda.. and our bill with tip was over $40. However, the food was fantastic. I love the farm to table concept - everything was fresh and tasty.
