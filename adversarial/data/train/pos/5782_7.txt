Well, I was told that the establishment was an upscale popular spot that was highly recommended. For the Scottsdale area, I did have expectations of something other than what we received.\n\nWe had a reservation for 12. We were late but frankly it wasn't a problem as the restaurant had maybe 20% of the chairs filled.\n\nWe sat down at a long bench style booth and despite the lack of people in the establishment, the noise due to the music was overbearing. It was hard to hear anything.\n\nOur waiter was indifferent and when asked about menu items his suggestions were flaccid. He recommended everything and when pressed if he had tried some of them, he admitted no but customers had. Besides his disinterest, he did get some of the order incorrect. \n\nMy meal was a burger. How can a restaurant screw up a burger? Well the bun is critical. In this case, while the beef and toppings were wonderful, the bun was flimsy and soaked in the juice from the meat along with mayo. It fell apart immediately and I had to eat it deconstructed with a fork.\n\nThe drinks were watered down- I ordered a double vodka cran in a tall glass and it honestly tasted like cranberry.\n\nWe spent over $500 for my group and it was not worth the cost. The joint doesn't have a lot of personality and coupled with a negative customer experience element it was a bit disconcerting.
