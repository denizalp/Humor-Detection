Beware.  I contacted this company when I couldn't reach my regular company.  The company sent out a tech to my rental property and they said that my system wouldn't hold pressure and I needed a whole new A\/C system for a charge of about $5500.  I then called another company who tested the system and just said that it needed cleaned and recharged.  They only charged me $150.\n6 months later and still no issues.  $150 vs. $5500 - you decide!
