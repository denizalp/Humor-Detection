This review is for the \"Buffet of Buffets\" 24 hour, all you can eat, buffet pass. This magical pass allows you to enjoy all day access to the buffets at 7 different Harrah's properties. The price is $39.99 for Rewards Club members and $45.99 for non-members. It is seriously easy to sign up for the pass and worth the $5 savings. The best day to buy the pass is Sunday because the brunch buffets include the booze free of charge. Also, remember to check the operating hours at each buffet because they do vary.\n\nNote: We did all seven locations (actually 8 buffets because we hit one twice) back to back in 11 hours.\n\nThe buffets included in the deal are: Le Village Buffet inside Paris, Planet Hollywood's Spice Market Buffet, Flamingo's Paradise Garden Buffet, Flavors at Harrah's, Lago Buffet at Caesars, the Emperor's Buffet at Imperial Palace and Rio's Carnival World Buffet!\n\nSpice Market Buffet at Planet Hollywood-If you really want to feel as if you are in a hot, stuffy, crowded, spice market, this is the place for you. It is in the basement, so there are no windows and no doors. The line to pay is right in the center of the room and the quarters are mighty tight. There were alot of people in very little space with very little air flow and it was 111 degrees outside...use your imagination.\n\nWe hit this stop for brunch. The stations included salad, seafood, Italian, Asian, and \"mid-east.\" Yes, I swear it was labeled \"mid-east.\" At first I thought it was food from Indiana or Ohio, but I guess they meant \"Middle East\" wink, wink. There was a random selection of Greek and Indian food...surprise, Greece and India are now in the middle east! Oh, and there was hummus.\n\nOverall, the space was dank and depressing. Win was that the champagne was cold and served in a flute. The bigger win was that we saved the life of a fellow diner who was choking with the Heimlich Maneuver. If you do not plan to drink or save a life this stop may be disappointing.
