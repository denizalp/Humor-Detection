Brand new store so the bad service was due more to everyone learning than anything else.\n\nOrdered the large BBQ chicken pizza and it was not worth the $25 at all. Even for an expensive town the prices are steep. \n\nThe sauce was good but the dough\/crust were shit. Reminded of old school 90s Domionos.  Not worth it, go to Grimaldis on Eastern.
