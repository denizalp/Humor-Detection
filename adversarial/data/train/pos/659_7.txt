Okay so this place is more like 3.5 stars. Maybe four, I may update later on. I think the food is somewhere on the border of mediocre and pretty good. I would go back, more than once, but mostly just because it is convenient. But I must say, the Shrimp Diablo great. Not only is it a pretty bad a** name for shrimp, but it is a great spicy flavor and they give you tortillas to make shrimp burritos I guess.
