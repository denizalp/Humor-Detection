I was recommended to see Dr. Ted through a close friend of mine. I have never been under the care of a chiropractor and was a little nervous at first but upon my first consultation, I could genuinely sense that he truly has a passion for helping people feel better. I have suffered from migraines since I was 16 and have been put on several medications throughout the years. None of them ever seemed to work. Dr. Ted had his brother and office manager, Vincent send me to get x-rays right away. He found the problem and has been amazing at getting it resolved. Seeing a chiropractor is not a quick fix, it is necessary to be aligned to feel good and Dr. Ted has shown me the value of his work. He is a kind, caring, funny, and passionate person. His office manager, Vincent is also amazing. He is very meticulous and hardworking and always works with my schedule. I have not suffered from a migraine since seeing him and I have stopped all pain medication and migraine medication. I have also referred close friends and co-workers to him because he simply is the best. Thank you, Dr. Ted
