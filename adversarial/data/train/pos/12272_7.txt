Today is Bash Fat Tuesday day....That means I get to copy my fat tuesday review and paste it on another one! Yes...I am the Fat Tuesday Slurpee bandit. Really....Get a margarita machine....Or better yet. Go to the Sev....and bring your own liquor and pour in about two oz of liquor per 16 oz of slurpee....Yes...rinse and repeat. There. That is your training class for Fat Tuesdays. You are now certified as a FAT TUESDAY BARTENDER. Thank you come again.\n\nOK --- Fat Tuesday = Not a bar.\nIt's where 7-11 employees graduate to. Seriously a monkey can pour an adult slurpee. This place is for amateurs.\nWhen you first turn 21...This is a good place. \n\"yea I want some red....and purple....and blue.....and mix it with a little white. Oh and put a shot of malibu...\"\n\"Yea and can I get one for my girlfriend too? She wants purple....with green...and red....and white. No shot of malibu. It's too strong\"\nBaby steps....baby steps.....
