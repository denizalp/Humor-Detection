BUN BO HUE!!  If you're looking for the best place for BBH, I highly recommend trying District One. \n\nDistrict One is more upscale than your normal Vietnamese restaurants.  Love the ambiance and how spacious it is!  The booths are huge! Big enough to fit 3-4 people on each end.  They also have plenty of tables to accommodate bigger parties.  This has always been a favorite when planning big party dinners.  \n\nI've tried a number of appetizers here, but I've stayed true to ordering one entree off the menu, and that's Bun Bo Hue.  On the menu, it's listed as, \"Hue Spicy Beef Noodle,\" and it comes with beef shank, pork loin, and hue pork roll.  It's soo good!  It's unique in the way that it doesn't come off as oily and you don't have to sift through the spices to get to the broth.  Add some lime, cabbage, herbs, and you're good to go!  I rarely ever finish a bowl of pho, but time and time again, i see the bottom of the bowl whenever I'm here.  \n\nThey also have good appetizers as well!  I enjoy getting the chicken wings, oysters, and spring rolls.\n\nThey offer Vietnamese beer and fresh coconut juice!  They also have different specials each night.  The last time I was there, they offered shigoku oysters for $3.50 each.  And also, Happy Hour is from 5-7pm and 12p-2am!  It's a great place to come for late night eats and being able to enjoy everyone's company!
