This place is definitely not what I was expecting. From the pictures and the rave reviews, this place was disappointing. Another review said this place is now under new ownership but kept the same name, which I believe is completely accurate. \n\nWhen looking into the display case, the gelato looks nothing like the pictures, it's just regular gelato plopped in it's container - no extra sprinkles, nuts, or garnishes to let you know the flavor.\n\nI tried a few of the favors: \n\nPistachio (a go-to all the time!!) - didn't even taste like pistachio at all\nSweet Corn: no flavor of corn, or any real flavor of anything \nCookies and crean: icy with black cookie specks but no cookies and cream flavor\nCappuccino: only decent flavor that actually tasted like coffee\n\nI ended up getting a scoop of the cappuccino and the bf went for the cookies and cream. After paying, the man behind the register said, \"Ciao!\". Nothing against the new owners trying to create an Italian vibe for a gelato store, but he was clearly Hispanic (he was speaking Spanish to his coworker when we first came in) and it all just felt like an imitation of what this place used to be.
