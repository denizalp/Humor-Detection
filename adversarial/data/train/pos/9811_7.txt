I've been to Plum several times and am always impressed with their menu, sushi and ambiance. It's a wonderful location to catch up with friends as it can be a little noisy. \n\nThe last time I went I asked the waiter if the Marilyn Mon Roll could be deep fried (deep fried sushi is amazing, trust me). When I got the bill, I was charged $3.00 to deep fry the roll. Are you kidding me? I could've taken my plate to McDonalds down the road and they would've deep fried it for free. Not only is charging to deep fry something outrageous, the waiter never mention nor was it listed in their menu that it would be an additional charge. I paid it and decided I wouldn't return if the wait staff can't communicate the cost of what you're purchasing if it's not listed on the menu.
