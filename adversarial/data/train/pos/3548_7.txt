Woof woof woof!  **tail wags hard**  Woof woof!\n\nOwners' interpretation: great park, lots of fun for the pets.  Nice sectioned-off area for small dogs is handy.  It's rare for the park to be completely empty, which means regular socializing for your pet.  The space is large but largely bare.  Also, poor drainage leaves lots of ponds for you and your pet to get muddy in in the rain.  While I've seen lots better parks, this is the only one I'm aware of in the Chambana area, so be sure to go there and let your pet socialize!
