I was going to go there for lunch but could not force myself to go in after reading all the rules the have in place for the after eight crowd. No excessive jewelry no solid colors no tank tops and the list goes on. When do Toby become become such a controlling Libtard. Almost felt like the Feds were running it. Can't patronize places like that.
