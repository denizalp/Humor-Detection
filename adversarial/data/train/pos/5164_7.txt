Delightful breakfast spot and cafe. Repurposed wood and brick walls, exposed ceilings, table settings that hearken to harvest time, a wonderful assortment of baked goods (such as the exceptionally buttery and flaky  chocolate croissant or the apple muffin that tastes like an apple fritter).\n\nGreat breakfast options here with local and organic products, seasonal fruits, and noble bread. I love that they feature Croque Monsieur, my favorite breakfast sandwhich with bechamel and gruyere (basically a savory  French toast sandwhich that Is out of this world.)
