One of the nicest hotels I have stayed at on the strip. And I have been to Vegas numerous times and stayed in numerous places. The staff is incredibly nice. \n\nWe had a king size bed and it was one of the most comfiest bed ever in Vegas that I have laid on. The suite was way to big for both of us but we didn't mind at all. =) Two flat screens in the room, what more can you ask for? \n\nTHEY SHAMPOO THE CARPET LIKE ONCE A DAY! How awesome is that?! Super clean and not nasty feeling.\n\nI loved the bathroom! It had a flat screen in there and I think I watched more TV in the bathroom while getting ready then out in the room. The vanity will make a girl feel that much more girly when getting ready. The bathtub is amazing!\n\nI definitely would stay here again the next time I come back and I think you should too because suites are dirt cheap! Well, if you think $300 a night is cheap but hey, it's VEGAS!
