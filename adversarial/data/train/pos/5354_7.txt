New in town & this place was recommended to my husband and I by many people.  We are both from CA, so we know good Mexican food.  We have been living in Italy for the past few years, where Mexican food is non-existent, so we were looking forward to eating here.  I got the 1 taco & 1 enchilada plate & my husband got the 1 burrito & 1 enchilada plate.  While eating the beans I was thinking to myself how salty they were, & then moved on to the taco which was even more salty. It tasted like I was eating pure salt. I mentioned it to my husband, & he said the same thing.  Needless to say, we did not finish our food. Will not be eating here again.
