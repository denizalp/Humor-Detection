If your vegetarian.....vegan.....or just your average HEALTHY Joe then this is your location. This is only the second location in the ENTIRE state of Arizona and I am stoked because it is within walking distance of my job. There are noodles.....salads.....and Sandwiches for everyone.....but the NOODLES are AWESOME. I had the Japanese Pan Noodles with TOFU and while they were not as Spicy as I like they were delicious. My only complaint was the veggies.....they were great but they need to include more especially for a bowl that is north of 8 bucks. Now don't get me wrong this won't deter me from coming to this locale in the future because I am extremely excited it is near my place of employment.....however I will ask for more veggies next time. \n\nThis place is located right off the Freeway (check the address above) but some people may know it as the Deer Valley Towne Center. It is located right next to the WildFlower Bread Company Restaurant which is right next to a Mattress Firm. Don't forget to sign up for the E-Club and right now when you buy an Entree' you will get a coupon to take a survey to receive a free Appetizer with purchase on your next visit. So if your ever in the area and have a craving for something fresh and Healthy give these guys a try. Eat, Drink, and be Merry my Friends!!!!!!
