They have a great variety of products but they do not have any manners at all. Very rude. I called in to ask for a price on a product for a customer of mine (Our store does not carry the product she was looking for so I decided to be helpful) and she did not give me the price which would have been okay but when I asked why she rudely snickered and stated \"Do you know how many people call and ask about prices everyday?\" Uh no, I don't know because I don't care. I just wanted to know why because my company does give prices to customers who are calling and this is the first time hearing that policy.
