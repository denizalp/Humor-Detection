I had sadly forgotten that this location was here! I was in a Chipotle mood and decided that this was the spot for dinner. \n\nWe arrived around 5:00pm and it was starting to get busy. There was only one girl working the line but she quickly made our food.  \n\nWe had one steak burrito, one order of three crunchy chicken tacos, a carnitas bowl, and a side of chips. \n\nWe stood at the register for a few minutes until finally a different employee came on over to ring us up. \n\nI had never ordered grilled chicken at chipotle. I usually always get the barbacoa because it is to die for! On this day I ordered three chicken tacos. The chicken was a no for me and I will definitely stick with barbacoa from now on.\n\nOur side of chips were super salty and we did not eat them. I tried giving them to my dogs but they didn't even want them... \n\nThe tables were clean and they even have a small outdoor patio to dine at. Employees could be friendlier though and speak a little louder. \n\nWill be back soon for some barbacoa!
