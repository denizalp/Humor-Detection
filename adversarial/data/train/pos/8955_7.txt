For me, Capital Grille is one of those places you hit up for a special occasion or restaurant week. I mean hey, I make hundreds (baller)... so it's not in the budget all the time. The friends and I ventured here last night for the gingerbear's birthday.\n\nLet's start with the service. My oh my is it amazing. From the bar, to the table and everything in between... absolutely top notch.\n\nDrinks: My knees go weak for an amazing filthy martini. They make it just the way I like it. Bonus: they bring the shaker out to the table and pour it in front of you. Double bonus: blue cheese stuffed olives. I also recommend their signature drink the Stoli Doli martini. Great cocktail. But beware: it's so good you may forget about the fact that it is pure booze. For the wine lovers, the selection is overwhelming... which is a good thing.\n\nFood: the pan fried calamari is CG's signature app. My problem here though is that I can not partake in appetizers or else I stuff myself full before the main course arrives. Last night I went with French Onion Soup, split a house salad with my friend and the Sliced Filet Mignon with Cipollini Onions and Wild Mushrooms. We also got the lobster mac n cheese and grilled asparagus. It was all pretty amazing. I may or may not be still thinking about that mac n cheese. Wow, that's a must get side item there.\n\nDessert: I was already full at this point... like throw-a-white-flag-in-the-air kind of full. But then it happened- they brought out a tray with every one of their desserts on it for the birthday boy. I had no choice but to try them all. My personal fav was the cheesecake with berries and a caramelized brulee topping.\n\nMany thinks to all of the staff... especially Alisa... at Capital Grille for another great night. I'll be back as soon as my wallet forgives me.
