They just did a huge makeover of this park. It is amazing. The toys are so interactive and up to date. The ramadas and tables are new and look nice. The park just looks awesome and I would recommend people come to here to have picnics or parties. On the weekends food trucks are available to try out. How cool is that! The city of Mesa works hard to make sure the park stays clean and nice. Park Rangers are normally around checking things out.
