After getting our flex on at the gym, Mikey Elite ops for KoMex. At first the thought of this fusion restaurant wasn't jiving with me. The \"hear says\" and reviews weren't bullshit'n!\n\nOff the bat, the nice lady asks if we checked-in. Free fried wontons! Come up! I love Yelp supporting establishments. EYE LIKA CHU PEOPLES!!!\n\nThey offer four different types of hot sauces. The green and red chille sauce that usually is seen at a taco joint. I think the other two were Korean and Chinese hot sauces. \n\nWe got beef tacos, a beef tostada, and a beef chimichanga. The tacos were fat and delicious. I like how you can opt for a lettuce wrap instead of a tortilla.  The tostada had a fried ricecake for its' base. It complimented the bulgogi chill'n on top with the herbs and spices. I had a sample of the bulgogi chimichanga. It was cheesy and delicioso. \n\nAlthough everything was awesome, the tacos were the winner for me. They've placed 2nd on my taco favorites. MMMMMMM BATCH!!!! I like running into new creative restaurants. They pulled it off yo! :)  @ $16 we felt like pigs. STONER STAMP OF APPROVAL!!!\n\nEYE LIKA CHU PEOPLES!!!
