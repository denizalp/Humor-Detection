The coconut salt scrub that they provide in their bathrooms is amazing! Seriously, ladies head to the restroom and try it out. It will leave your hands silky, soft and smooth. We especially appreciated it on our hands after having rock climbed all day. Unfortunately, the scrub is not available in the men's restroom, which is a shame, because I think the guys would appreciate it as much as the ladies. \n\nThe restaurant features lots of  beautifully carved wood, which creates a serene environment. You are served by beautiful authentically attired Thai servers. Their costumes are gorgeous. The food is delicious, typical Thai fare. No complaints here! If you are looking for a cute Thai spot for a date place this is the place to come. If you are looking for Thai food in a beautiful relaxing environment this is also the place to come.
