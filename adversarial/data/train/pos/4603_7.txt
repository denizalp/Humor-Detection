When you look at the pictures on the website, remember that you are looking at RENOVATED rooms.    There are rooms here that have not been renovated and look out of date. \n\nI gave this hotel a 3-star review because one of the nicest people here.  It was the bartender CHANTAL.  She was very nice and informative.\n\nThe front desk personnel, on the other hand, were more of a challenge to deal with.  Make sure you have more than a fourth grade level French.
