I have struggled for a long time trying to figure out how to write a fair review of this place. For quite a while it was my favorite place to stay. The rooms are nice and very wheelchair friendly. One time I even got an upgrade when my room wasn't ready. Anyone who has read my reviews knows that I love their clubs and restaurants. \n\nLast year I stayed here for the 1st week of the NCAA Tournament. For the first two days, I mainly stayed in the Sportsbook, betting and watching the games. On Saturday I woke up with a horrendous case of the flu. For the next two days I barely left my room.  I even cancelled my dinner reservations at N9NE, so you know I was sick!\n\nWhen I checked out, I went to the VIP Office, which I was told to do by my host. When I got there, I gave my card to the gentleman at the desk. He ran my card and before I could explain what had happened and that I wasn't looking for comps or anything, he proceeded to chastise me for not playing enough. He actually told me that I was wasting his time! I tried to explain to him that I wasn't looking for anything I was just doing what my host told me to do any time I stayed there. I asked him if I was supposed to come down and play blackjack even though I was puking my guts out every 20 minutes? He got so angry with me that I thought he was going to call security. I don't know what set him off, but I don't think I did anything to deserve being treated like that. \n\nSo I left, feeling like a school kid who was sent to the principals office for something they didn't do! I haven't been back since except for one dinner at Simon @ Palms Place. I probably will stay there again someday, but I just can't bring myself to do it yet. Before this incident I would've rated them a Five, but now I lowered them to a 2. \n\nThank you Yelp, for letting me vent.  I Feel Better Now!
