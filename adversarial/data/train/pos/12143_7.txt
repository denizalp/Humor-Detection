Batista Shane!\nI almost never find myself on this side of town, but a friend's retirement party does give some merit. On the way there I knew I needed a little caffeine and even though I trying to break up with Starbucks... They are the easiest way to get caffeine in my system when I'm on the go. \n\nPulled up to the drive through & asked if they had any hazelnut drizzle (shot in the dark) They didn't so I ordered a iced green tea late w\/ coconut milk, may as well give it a try. The coconut milk was not my favorite. It gave the latte a distinct, weird flavor. The drink was still edible, but not that good.\n\n Anyway, Shane the barista was simply delightful! Hands down best barista I have ever come across. Extremely friendly, genuine and knowledgeable - What a great combination. Just when I'm ready to cut Starbucks loose they pull me back in. \n\nAlthough an amazing barista 45 minutes from my house will never make up for discontinuing hazelnut drizzle. I mean what are the thinking? It's the best drink ever. I just want to cry knowing I'll never have another hazelnut macchiato. I can not write enough sternly worded emails over this very traumatic experience. In case Starbucks ever reads this, I also want to say, adding coconut milk is a nice gesture, but everyone knows almond milk goes much better in dairy-free coffee. Ridiculous!
