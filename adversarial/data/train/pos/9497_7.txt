Saturday Morning to-do list was extensive that required plenty energy, water, and nutrition (Organ Pipe). Where else would I have been able to garner the necessary fillings knowing that we ran the risk of having no real food for 10 hours in the unforgiving Southern Arizona 115 degree heat? Butterfield was the spot.\n\nBefore I divulge... My first option was Butters Pancakes but their parking situation was stupid so I just left. I am not going to waste time driving in circles for a parking spot just to wait another hour or so to  sit and another 30 min to eat. There is more important ways to utilize the limited time I had to try and attempt everything for the day's ambitions.\n\nThere was a short five minute wait at Butterfields with plenty parking. \n\nService: A\nThe staff was nice. No attitudes on my visit.\nThe waitress and floaters accommodated for all my weird quirks and particulars. Thank you.\n\nLocation: A\nLocated in a mall setting in Scottsdale somewhere. I'm not a local so can't comment much. The roads are large and the joint is visible off of the main road.\n\nDecor\/Interior: C\nThis is nothing bad. The decor is bland.\n\nFood: A (without the omlette). F (with the omlette).\nOmlette\/Scrambles: F. \nLet's just start with the bad. My body rejected the omlette. I don't know how else to say that without being vulgar. I will just leave it at that. If you are considering between omlette and others, you have been warned. \n\nHash Browns: A\nCertain hash browns were commercialized. Still good though.\n\nProtein Pancake: A\nI chose this flapjack out of practicality. As mentioned above, I needed the proper energy. This hearty filler provided the necessary carbs\/nuts to keep me over for over 10 hours. Flavor is as you would expect: dry, however, that doesn't mean you can't make it taste good. Just add a bit of syrup and jelly. I used a puny amount to avoid needless bad sugar intake.\n\nTaffy Apple French Toast: A\nAmazing flavors. It's sweet. No syrup needed. The warm apples and soft french toast were nice.\n\nCinnamon Roll French Toast: A\nThis is super sweet. i wouldn't recommend this if unless your going to sit on the couch all day. It's basically a flat cinnamon roll with the option to add powdered sugar, syrup and butter on top. \n\nOverall: A\nThis would be a regular spot if I was local.
