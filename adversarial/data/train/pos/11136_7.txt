I'll be honest, if it wasn't for Yelp (and Daren C), I would have probably never known that Good Fellas Grill existed and I would have never known the deliciousness I was missing! I've eaten here several times now and I am officially a fan! I love Mediterranean food and Good Fellas Grill lives up to my love. Everything here is juicy, fresh and delicious.\n\nMy favorite meal is the Mediterranean salad with either chicken or lamb. The meat is juicy with the perfect about of marination that makes it tasty with every bite. The salad is hefty and could easily be two meals. The salad dressing is salty and yummy! However, I will say that I'm a sucker for carbs and I love their buttery rice as well. I like to order a side of the rice. Other go-to items are the lentil soup and one of the meat dishes. \n\nGood Fellas is a no-frills, homey food style place. It's perfect for lunch on the go, for a casual lunch or dinner with kids or just if you want to grab some takeout! \n\nPS - it's right by Turf Paradise, so if you're there for the races, stop by on your way home!
