HIdden MF'ing gem in Las Vegas.  If you have a car or are not afraid to venture off the strip for some cheap, good eats, this is the spot to go!\n\nIt was a lenten friday on our vacation, so we were on the search for some seafood.  We didn't feel like paying $30 for a buffet or eating some fried fish sandwich from a fast food joint, so one of us came up with the great idea to have some Thai food.  Yelp to the rescue!\n\nWe were about a mile from this place, and a 4.5 star average?  We can't lose.  And we definitely did not.  We started off by sharing the seafood tom yum soup, which was delicious.  It had shrimps, mussels, squid, and fish balls.  We ordered it medium, but would have definitely been ok with mild, as we were all dripping in sweat by the time we took our 2nd and 3rd bites.  For my entree, I went with the green curry with shrimp.  I wish there was more shrimp, but the food itself was very well prepared and tasted great.  \n\nOther entrees on my table were pad thai, 5 spiced (?) salmon, and some other fried red curry salmon.  It was meat-less friday remember?  haha  All of us had nothing but positives to say about our dishes.  And, all the dishes were less than $10.  Score!\n\nThe service here is excellent as well.  Seeing our sweat soaked faces, the waitresses were quick to refill our waters and even put the fan next to us.  Lol.  I have never been anywhere that would actually do that for you.  haha\n\nParking is a bit weird here.  I did not see a parking lot, except for the one across the street, so we had to play frogger in Las Vegas chinatown, which was another adventure in itself.  \n\nOverall, food is excellent and I will be back.
