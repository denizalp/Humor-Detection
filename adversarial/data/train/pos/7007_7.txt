Oh cute, they have a big selfie camera by check-in and cute little ducks and fish in the garden.. To distract you from the hell you'll be staying at. I get it, it's one of the oldest casinos in Vegas.. but this was hell. (Thanks to my sister for booking it) \n\nNight 1- walking through the hall to our room, tripping over the dirty blackened carpet because it's scrunched up ever few feet. Our room look like it was being renovated.. there were holes in the sheets, no ice bucket, very few wall outlets that worked. Slept with a sweater cause I was iffy about the cleanliness of the place. Whatever we had our laugh and told my sister she can never pick the room again. \n\nNight 2- Didn't wear a sweater, I sleep with the pillow in-between my head and arm so it lays in my inner elbow (can't explain it better Sry lol) ..woke up with some sort of rash in the creases of my arms. Don't know what it was, freaked out and scrubbed the shit out of my arms in the shower. Calmly went down to speak to management, \"go talk to blah blah in the valet area.\" The girl at valet gets on the phone with blah blah and says \"yea um some girl needs to speak to you about bed bugs or I don't know she has a rash haha yea I don't know\" ......the many people around us look over and now everyone knows I have a rash. That's when I lost it, politeness gone, smile gone, patience gone, I was so mad that this \"professional employee\" put my business on blast and decided to giggle about it in front of me. I filed a report about my arms and It's been two months and no ones called me back about it, I'm sure they won't.. You know cause they are busy running such a great hotel\/casino.
