The Jasmine tea was perfect along side the Dim Sum!! Every food I tried was fresh and well prepared. It felt as if I were dining in Hong Kong. That is wonderful! Many other restaurants in town fall short on authenticity. This is a great restaurant and the service is very attentive!! I also loved the egg noodles, really crisp. The spring rolls were nice and the orange beef was superb. I admit, I ordered so much food that I had to take quite a lot home in a couple to go boxes. Hey, but that's a good thing!!! :))
