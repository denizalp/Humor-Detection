MMMMmmmmm VEAL. If you're vegan or vegetarian please stop reading right meow because I'm gonna get violent with this review.....\n\n.... Still reading? OK, I warned you. \n\nI LOVE VEAL. LOVE IT. Like, sometimes someone will bring up the whole - ohhh how could you eat a BABY cow (same for lamb). Easy, like this NOM NOM fuckin' NOM.\n\nThis is one instance where saying the younger the better doesn't land you in jail, so tie that bad boy baby bull up, slice it and dice it, filet it, fry it and smack 4-5 slices in between a fresh kaiser bun and load up the toppings and we'll call it a day. \n\nDo I feel bad? Only if I try to eat two sandwiches, then I regret... NOTHING!\n\nOn-A-Bun... not to be confused with the Mississauga burger joint On-THE-Bun (which is Halal), is as others have said, an Italian sanGwich shop (in Italian your pronounce all D's like G's) in the style of the reigning GTA Champions of this food style California Sandwiches and San Francesco Sandwiches. You can opt for a meatball, steak, eggplant parm, chicken or of course the veal. But let's be serious, you come for the veal.\n\nYes toppings MAY be at a charge, but don't be so bloody cheap, if you compare prices, the sandwiches at On-A-Bun actually run cheaper overall, and even maxing out my toppings (Rapini, Cheese, Mushrooms and Hot peppers) it's still cheaper that Cali-sands. \n\nAnyone who is complaining about paying for toppings - again, you're cheap. Go to the other popular joints and you will see that you pay per item. In fact, California Sandwiches is upt ot $1-$1.50 per topping, where at On-A-Bun the price lays closer to around $0.88. If you want free toppings, go to Harveys and have it your way, but don't complain about paying for high-quality gourmet ingredients.\n\nI'm happy this place is now on my radar because when I'm in the West-end, I can now nab a calorie (1400-1800) laden sangwich for less than I usually pay at my regular spot.\n\nEatcrest Out.... Moo (baby cow noise) Muuahhha hahahaha
