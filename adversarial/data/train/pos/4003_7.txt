Came here last night during Happy Hour. We have been here quite a few times now. Always a nice experience I must say. I love the fish tank inside. It is very soothing! \nLast night was a little cold, but one day it will be just right to sit on the Patio. Heheee\nOur service was prompt, all our food came out hot as well. I tried a Sangria they offer with Saki in it. I could not really taste the Saki, but it is good.\nTacos are wonderful, since I do not eat Pork, they switched them out to fish and shrimp. \nIt is a great place to stop in anytime. But, Happy Hour is really nice.
