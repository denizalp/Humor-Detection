I was born on pi day (3.14), so you'd think I'd be a huge fan of pie. I wasn't until I had Hubbard Avenue Diner pie. We ordered a slice of the strawberry rhubarb, and between bites of pie I was all WHOA and OMG spices and wouldn't shut up about it. Pi day might just have to be pie day, instead of what it was before -- icecream cake day.\n\nThey were open Labor Day, which led to ten points for Gryffindor. Despite being swamped that whole morning, their staff was friendly, efficient, and worked well as a team. Plus, our waiter laughed when we said we wanted pie first. I think he knew we had our priorities straight. \n\nWe ordered the standard diner scramble and the veggie quiche, both brunch specials. They were well balanced meals, flavor and texture wise; my quiche came with a cup of fruit and slice of blueberry loaf. There seemed to be several gluten free and vegan options too, which is considerate -- not something you see often in a Midwestern diner.\n\nBut seriously, their pie. Next time I'm invited to Thanksgiving, or maybe a 4th of July BBQ, I'll sign up for pie and I'm sure it'll be the hit of the party. If not, then there'll be more for me.
