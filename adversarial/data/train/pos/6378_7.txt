I was really excited to try Da Valley Grill ... a taste of the islands in the desert? Per the reviews, I was so down! Well, perhaps I set my expectations a wee bit high? Don't get me wrong, a solid spot with some classic choices a good quick service lunch if you're in the area. \nEverything was good but not 5 star \"best I've ever had\" great. \nService was kind, efficient and fast but food was just meh for us. \nWe had the following: \nThe spicy garlic shrimp (not spicy but sweet) and the Locomoco patty had a \"previously frozen\" taste to it. Veggie spring rolls were crispy and delicious. \nSo an A-Ok if in the area stop for lunch but just not that wowzy ya dig?
