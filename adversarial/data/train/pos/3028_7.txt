Another home run. \nI love fox concepts. Each of the fox restaurants I've been to are unique but share the same quality good service and the same fluid flow of a well run restaurant.\n\nThis was our first time to north Italia. I wanted to try the chicken Parm and the mussels. \n\nThe bread was ok. Alright, I'll be honest. The bread was pretty unimpressive. I was slightly worried because of the bread was not so great, how was the meal going to be? Thankfully, my worries were unnecessary.\n\nThe mussels had me at first bite. I wanted to drink the leftover broth afterwards. Highly recommend it if you like mussels.\n\nChicken Parm was good and perfectly petite portion sized for those watching your waistlines. No leftovers here...
