This review is for the hotel stay at the Mirage only!\n\nOne star is too generous for this room. I've stayed at hotels, motels, inns, in several different states. I've stayed in Vegas more times than I can count, or even rememberthis room is by far, landslide far, the dirtiest. \n\nHousekeeping should be ashamed of themselves! It's quite nasty. Does anyone in this department take pride in their work? \n\nFor November 18 & 19th on the 24th  floor I can answer that's a big giant NO. And by the way the puke\/food\/fecal matter that's dried up on the ....wait for it BAR counter and the build up of mildew\/mold in the shower they haven't taken pride in their work for sometime. \n\nI've attached 19 pictures... yes 19.. of the most disgusting all but the hairy bathtub were taken right upon check-in. The hairy bathtub is today after housekeeping, its dirtier now than it was before I left this am. \n\nI put a nice(sincerely good morning, please leave extra towels, thank you nice)note this morning and a generous tip directly behind the puke-poo- god please let it be food drip hoping housekeeping would see it and clean it....no it's still there. There is no way they didn't unless they are legally blind and if that's the case I understand why my room looks and smells the way it does. \n\nI'm extremely hesitant to complain while I'm still staying here for fear of retaliation. \n\nIf I can't trust that housekeeping is doing at least the bare minimum of cleaning how can I trust that they are taking the serious and life-threatening housekeeping duties seriously! STDs like gonorrhea have been found to survive in towels for up to 24 hours, and chlamydia was detected on plastic surfaces for up to 45 minutes. The virus that causes genital herpes is also transmissible via non-sexual contact, surviving for up to two hours outside the body.\n\n\nI DO NOT RECOMMEND The Mirage Hotel \n\n\n.
