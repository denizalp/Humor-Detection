Decided I'd do the \"lunch special #10\" which comes with a slice of pizza, small salad and a medium drink for $6.90. It's a dollar extra for each pizza topping; I elected to splurge the extra buck and get pepperoni on my slice. While in line I noticed the hoagies that were being served... they looked really good and I almost changed my mind. \"Maybe next time\", I thought. At 12:22 PM I placed the order, paid my total of $8.45 (including tax), was asked if this order was for \"eat in or to go\" (it was for \"eat in\") and I found a table to sit down at.\n\nThe salad came out quickly. It was fresh with what you would expect; lettuce, tomato, spinach, cucumber and onion. But what made me smile is that they had raspberry vinaigrette available. My favorite! I enjoyed the salad while waiting for my slice. \n\nI did notice while waiting and watching Sports Center on the TV above the checkout counter that the dining area is kept remarkably clean. \"Good for them\", I thought. But as I continued to wait and watch Sport Center, twenty minutes later, for a single slice of pepperoni pizza, I couldn't help but notice that there were only five other customers in the dining area (three of which already had their food) and I began to wonder if I was going to be late (again) returning to the office.\n\n25 minutes later, no slice. \n\nAt 12:50 I inquired about the single slice of pepperoni pizza and requested it in a \"to go\" box. I walked out the door with a single slice of pepperoni pizza in a box at 12:58.\n\nI enjoyed my single slice of pepperoni pizza back at the office. It was a large slice with a generous amount of pepperoni and it tasted pretty good. Not the warmest slice I ever had, mind you, but it was tasty. \n\nI doubt though that I'll ever find the time to see if the hoagies are any good.
