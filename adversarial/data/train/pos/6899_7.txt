My husbands suggestion was a good one! \n\nWe stopped in for lunch.  They were pretty busy with inside diners and carry out orders.  I took this as a good sign.  The service was good.  He was very helpful in our lunch choices all with a friendly personality.   \n\nI decided on the beef and lamb gyro with the feta fries on the side.  The gyro was great.  It is definitely packed full.  The meat had a great flavor! The mound of feta fries were too much to handle.  They were good but a little different with the sprinkled oregano all over the top.   I would have liked them better without the oregano but not too bad.  \n\nWith the Yelp check in, you received a free baklava.  It was absolutely perfect. It is a small piece but after the portion size of their lunch you don't need anymore than that.  \n\nI am pleased to find another Greek restaurant with great food.  Thank you Stephano's!
