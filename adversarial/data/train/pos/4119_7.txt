Since when is a fish not a pet? Someone tell me that. \n\nI stopped by Just Pets on a quiet Sunday afternoon in the hopes of purchasing a fishie. It's about time I had another companion around the house, I told myself. \n\nI walked in and immediately looked around the small place. No fish tanks. Ok, I played it off - like maybe I knew what I was doing - and began to browse. \n\nBox turtles\nScorpions\nGeckos\nSnakes\nHamsters\nBunnies\nAnd dogs, dogs, dogs. \n\nWhen I pulled up to the place, I began to wonder if this was a Just Dogs store, for the signage in the window was definitely leaning toward just that. They should rename the place. Seriously. \n\nI saw plenty of puppies. No kitties, though - which, let's be real, was a good thing since I would have wanted to adopt every single little purr ball. \n\nI decided to check out the puppies. I like puppies. I just never want to own another one. Quite an assortment. I listened in on a conversation as one sales associate tried to get a couple to make the leap and take a little hyper puppy home with them that day. They said they needed two more weeks to think it over. Once they left, the sales person said to another employee, \"They weren't going to buy the dog. I could have told you that.\" \n\nWell, okay. But, considering the prices, I would have needed time to mull it over, too. I don't know if these dogs are certified, come with papers or just have the uncanny ability to sniff out cancer cells, but for an average of $1,500, I'd hope these four-legged mooches (\"man's best friend\" for those who like dogs) would do more than slobber, spit up, crap all over and shed. Or, if you can shell out nearly $7,000, you can take the cute black labrador home with you! (Suddenly, I feel like I'm on a game show... oy.)\n\nBut, I digress... \n\nI found a ceramic feeding dish for my 20lb cat and made my way to the register. \"Is that it for you today?\" Yup. It certainly was. \n\nI s'pose if you're looking for a puppy, check out Just Pets. \nIf you're looking for a fishie, you'll have to go somewhere else.
