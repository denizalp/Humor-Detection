Best Service of any of the Toast \/ Famous Toastery Locations\n\nMy wife loves the Davidson location which is still a Toast and the second one they opened. My problem here has always been the service and the extraordinary long wait times, both to get a table and then once you're seated, the wait thereafter.\n\nWe walked into this location at 11:00 am after Church and they were in full swing. Parking lot was packed and people were waiting for people to leave to grab a parking spot.\n\nWalked in with trepidation. The waiting area was packed as was the rest of the restaurant and patio area. My wife asked how long a wait and was told 15- 20 minutes. Based on experience, my answer was I have to see it to believe it.\n\nHad a seat in the waiting area and had a complimentary cup of coffee and 10 minutes later our name was called.  Talk about a pleasant shock.\n\nWe were promptly seated, menus presented along with the complimentary corn bread, and beverage orders for our teas taken.\n\nThis chain is having fun with the 2016 Presidential Elections. At least some one has a sense of humor.  When we ate at the Famous Toastery at University City, I had the Trumplet which is an Omelet stuffed with meatloaf.  This time at this location, I ordered the Bernie Scramble with is Scrambled Eggs with Salmon, Cream Cheese and Capers along with Sauted Vegetables as a side.  Great variation on Lox and Bagles and it was very creative and more importantly, very tasty.\n\nMy wife was more traditional and had the Meatloaf with Mashed Potatoes which is one of her favorites.\n\nNeedless to say, we both enjoyed our meal.\n\nStill can not say enough about how well this restaurant is run. Even with restaurants with reputations for excellent service, good customer flow management, this one is one of the best I have ever seen.\n\nExcellent Restaurant and we will be back. Christmas is coming up which means many trips to Concord Mills and this is a very viable dining option.
