Now a days most pouplar restaurants seem to look always the same.classic wood and old Edison light bulbs .\nAn example of this........\nWoodlot \nI have to admit they Had a Good ambience it is a typical rustic Canadian style no different from any others very ordinary.\n\nHowever,everybody said \"u must try these sodas\"but it was Ok!!!!\nPork could have been more tender  soo chewy and onion soup was over powered by these aged STINKY cheeses.
