I love love love this place! Not every trip is a jackpot, but that is to be expected as inventory changes daily.\n\nThis location actually has a small home goods nook and a cosmetics area. I just picked up Urban Decay smoked pallet with 24\/7 eyeliner in Perversion, and a travel size primer for $19.97, whereas the cheapest I could find online was $40 on amazon. The eyeliner is full sized, and normally retails for $20, so the palette and primer was basically free!\n\nPicked up some sparkly Ivanka Trump Maggie peep toe pumps for $20! \n\nYou just have to get over the initial feeling of being overwhelmed to find a good deal, if you've got friends with you, the best strategy is divide and conquer ;o)\n\nAlso, be aware not everything is a screaming deal, there were some boots in the 'Clearance' section for ~$200. I'm sorry, but I really don't think any clearance item should be three digits!\n\nThey also have a nice section of menswear, shoes, and accessories. Was able to pick up an Original Penguin belt for $20 and Ted Baker Cuff links for $40.\n\nYou can also shop online and return any unwanted merchandise to the store within 90 days for a full refund.
