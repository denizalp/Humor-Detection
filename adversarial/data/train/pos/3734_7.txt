Detroit Ave Dairy Queen FTW!\n\nI celebrate my 200th review by celebrating something I enjoy almost as much as pizza: ice cream.  Specifically, blizzards. And let me tell you, there was nothing I wanted more at 9:30 last night than a chocolate blizzard with Heath bar. \n\nAnd I got it!! Oh, Dairy Queen. You always come through when I need you. It had been a full year since my last blizzard.  I was almost greedy and got a medium, but the small was more than enough. A weird surprise: they now have a \"mini\" size. Not that I would ever order a mini.\n\nNo matter how much time goes by between visits to a DQ, I never forget how frickin' delicious it is!!! Once a summer just about does it, though, and now I can go on living my life without this obsession hanging over my head.
