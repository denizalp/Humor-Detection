A little too snooty for its own good.\n\nThe ambiance seems cool, but it's kind of a cover up for the rest. \nThe food was well below mediocre:\nWe got the bruchettas ($12)- which were just sliced pieces of bread mind you - no toasty toastness whatsoever, which were scantily clad with their respective toppings. The worst offender was the salmon bruschetta which had a mere sliver of smoked salmon.\nThe antipasto plate ($16) started off on a high note with the prosciutto wrapped goat cheese and halved cherry tomato combo, but took a fall for the worse after the sampling the sliced cheese which looked like it came straight from Albertson's deli. Shoulda gone with another pizza or two instead. A complete rip off, and this is Tempe for chrissake. We ran out of bread and requested more - they charged us extra for this?!\n\nThe saving grace was the margarita pizza ($9) - the crust had a chewy yet crispy texture. The sauce was tangy and fresh. The mozzarella cheese was acceptable for a $9 pizza and the basil leaves were generously strewn across the pie.\nThe wine was reasonably priced, we got a Spanish white for $28 and the cocktail menu seemed interesting. I had the cucumber martini ($9) for dessert - a little on the sweet side but well made. \n\nOppps and I forgot to mention the \"La Bocca\" salad was described as having grilled peaches, which was a selling point for me. When it arrived it came in two bowls and sans peaches. We were charged a split fee, even though we didn't ask for the salad to be split. We're Greek for chrissake we eat off each others plates. \n\nIf I'm back in Tempe, I don't think I'd come back here.
