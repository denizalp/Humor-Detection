I don't write reviews, but I felt compelled to do so with this establishment. The nigiri sushi was very heavy on the rice and light on the fish.We stayed away from the rolls and stuck with the nigiri sushi. The owner\/chef, noticing us going for the more \"costly\" alternative, decided to load the sushi with an overwhelming amount of rice. It was an obviously underhanded way to get us to order less and get us full faster. Do not be fooled by the posted photograph. We've been to many AYCE sushi restaurants in Las Vegas and this by far is the worst. Do yourselves a favor and avoid this place like the plague.
