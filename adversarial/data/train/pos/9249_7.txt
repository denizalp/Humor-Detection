So since I'm from the east coast I was told to try this place. CHALLENGE ACCEPTED!\n\nPlace is small but quite busy. They seem to be able to handle it with no problem. Cashier was friendly and so were the cooks. The cooks also take your order to help speed it up which helps.\n\nSo since I'm from the East coast all Phillys come with CHEESE WIZ. I was beyond excited to finally try a place in vegas with Cheese Whiz. I ordered fries and a philly with onions and peppers and I specifically said CHEESE WHIZ, because I was so excited.\n\nGoing off the trust system I didn't watch them make it and told them to go even though I was eating it there. I get to my table and my sandwich has PROVOLONE :( :( :( :( I asked for cheese whiz.\nMy partner saw I was upset and asked me if I wanted him to go get it fixed. Since I work in restaurants I never complain and just take it. Plus the line was long again and knew it would take forever honestly and I waited long enough for this one in the first place. I was excited for my partner to try it too.\n\nI only want to go back because I want to actually have what I ordered. Next time write down the orders. This could have been avoided if you had tickets to go off of and not memory. Remember that. I gave this place a three star because the staff was friendly and they handled their own. It wasn't super fast, they just kept up.
