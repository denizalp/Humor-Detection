1 star for being open 24 hours.\n1 star for having a huge menu and good portions.\n1 star for not kicking us out when my friend fell asleep at the table.\n1 star for allowing us to throw french fries at her and make a mess.\n1 star for making it OK to do this all post-club at 4:30am, barefoot.\n\nThanks for being there during my birthday trip to Vegas. I'm not ashamed to say I visited you, at times, more than twice in a span of 24 hours. I can only hope I'm lucky enough to visit you soon.
