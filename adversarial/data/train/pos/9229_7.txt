If I had one word to describe the Cosmopolitan it would be SEXY...wait no-- CLASSY, wait no.....SEXY.  Grrr, I can't decide.  Ok, I'll go with SEXY.\n\nUnlike any other hotel resort on the Strip, the Cosmopolitan radiates with absolute class.  Even going to the parking garage you are in awe with the beauty in the simplicity of the mirrored \"COSMOPOLITAN\" name scrolled against the wall.  Can we say \"wow\"?  Then when you get below to the parking garage you see all the beautiful art on the walls and then notice red and green lights down the rows to let you know what space is available for parking.  Can we say \"technology\"?\n\nThen! When you stroll through the lobby you are mesmerized by the artistic columns that has a very modern feel to it.  Can we say \"sophisticated\"?  And then bam, there's the bar, right in the lobby. Too chic, too chic.\n\nBy far my favorite hotel on the Strip and a place that I recommend for everyone to visit. Anyone who's anyone goes to the Cosmopolitan-- know this now so you don't feel left out.  Just don't go there in sweats and Uggs, you're not doing yourself justice in this hotel if you do.  Put on your Vegas best people! Hip, hot and happening---that's what this is, that's what you are...so get on up! Inside the Cosmopolitan!\n\nI love this place not only because Mayer Hawthorne opened the Book & Stage four nights in the row here during its soft opening (my love for him is uncanny) but I love this place for it's genuine uniqueness.
