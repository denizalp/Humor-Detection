I heart tapas and I heart Firefly. \n\nI don't go nearly as often as I feel I should. Can't get enough of this place. We had another get together here with some friends and had yet another fantastic evening. I love almost everything on the menu. The lamb skewers are always cooked perfectly. The dates are to die for. We ordered some other of our favorites; pitchers of blood orange mojitos, patron peppers, mac n cheese and some tortilla espanola. Yum, yum and more yum. \n\nCan't get enough of this place. Still need to try the location on Sahara, though.
