I can't really say if this place is good\/bad with pricing, selection or customer service but it's busy and they didn't have enough staff to handle that. \n\nWe came in because they had one copy of a game we wanted and we needed to exchange another game for it. It was so busy with a long line that we walked in, looked at the situation for a bit and had to walk out. \n\nIt would have taken a while so we drove to another location we knew is not stupid busy.
