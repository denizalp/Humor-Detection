Let me preface this review by saying that I love the Paris Hotel.  I've always liked visiting, mainly because of their Champagne Brunch on Sunday and also due to their cafe and crepe selections.  I am giving Paris a sad 3-star rating after actually staying here for 1 week.\n\nThe best features of this hotel are the restaurants and welcoming atmosphere.  The cobblestone floors give it a nice touch, although a bit tricky to walk on when wearing 5-inch Louboutins.\n\nThe Eiffel Tower is a beautiful landmark in the midst of high-rise buildings but their room accommodations are simply not up to par.  It isn't the most expensive hotel but for comparable rates I'd rather stay elsewhere.\n\nRoom = 2 stars\n* a standard room during CES week (or any Convention week) is overpriced at all strip hotels but even if it wasn't CES week, they really need to update these horrible rooms.  At LEAST add a flatscreen TV.  I know these are available in their suites but it comes standard to new hotels so they need to stay competitive.  My biggest gripe was the bed. OMG!! After day 1, I thought I needed a chiropractor.  I suppose it doesn't help that my bed at home is a Tempur-Cloud Supreme.  My neck and back had kinks all week long!\n\nRoom Service = 3 stars\n* I ordered room service 2x for lunch during my 6-night stay.  The 1st order arrived w\/in 20 mins and I was very pleased with their Spinach Salad and Rotisserie Chicken Noodle soup.  My 2nd order took over 1 hour to arrive.  I almost called to complain because over the phone they told me 30 to 40 mins.  My 2nd order was a tuna salad sandwich which is usually served in a Croissant but I opted for Rye bread instead.  It was delicious!  The clam chowder had a nice flavor although the clams weren't very big.  Both meals were reasonably priced around $30 including tip.\n\nHousekeeping = 4 stars\n* I do not need my room cleaned every day because I'm not a messy person.  However, the few times I called for maid service they were great!  I was in the room 2x while housekeeping cleaned up.  The woman was really friendly, polite, and personable.  \n\nWiFi = $14.95\/day\n* a bit expensive but at least it was reliable.  I used the internet for 4 days.  Some hotels have specials for 3 days or 5 days so this would have been nice rather than paying a daily rate.\n\nBar = 4 stars\n* the main bar (in the middle of the hotel) has happy hour from 12p to 7p.  That's a hell of a happy hour. 2-for-1 martinis. Not a bad deal for Vegas and they offer waiter service so you don't need to wait at the bar.
