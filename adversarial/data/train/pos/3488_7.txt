well..... yea ...\n\nthis is scottsdale original sushi bar that has been awarded for the best sushi for more than 16 yrs? reallly? wait a second.. we ARE in arizona, so hmm, mebe the standards are quite different ... \n\ni, for one, was not thrilled ...  must say the sushi was quite ginormous but it sure didn't taste all that yummy and fresh... an average sushi ranged from $4 and up but honestly, if i was living in scottsdale, i would TOTALLY come for lunch... where can you find a deal for less than $5? whether you get chicken teriyaki\/cutlet or whatever it was literally $3.50. YES! for lunch!!!\n\n$3.50 for lunch! so unheard of! +1 for that\n\ndinner?\n\nan average dinner is $20\/up... SO not worth it... \n\nand who puts big chunky mushrooms in miso soup and sadly, there wasn't a SINGLE TOFU! is it just me or is that simply weird?
