I usually rate my favorite place 5 stars! My waiter Luis is excellent w\/ his service! BUT MY issue is it's so damn hot in there! What's up with that! Is the AC going out or trying to be conservative? Please someone put attention to this because I don't want to step coming to my favorite place! Eat comfortable when it's so darn hot in the restaurant!!!!\nI love coming here, I'm always greeted w\/ a smile. I love there breakfast items BUT they also have a delicious lunch\/dinner menu! \nToday I had fried shrimp, delicious mashed potatoes w\/ country gravy & fried zucchini...very very good!\nI only wish I didn't have to use MY WIFI minutes. The WiFi never ever seems to connect on Coco's free WiFi... it's been like this for far too long...
