I LOVE INGLOT!!\n\nMy new found addiction, inglot eyeshadows! =D\n\nIt took my friend and I awhile to find this store (this store is kind of hidden off in a corner), after walking through the entire mall we finally reached the store that made my trip to Vegas worthwhile!! \n\nOH, JUST IN CASE YOU DIDN'T KNOW ALREADY..I LOVE INGLOT\nWhen I walked in I was greeted by both of the friendly employees as I went over to look at the eyeshadows one of the MUAs asked me if I needed help finding anything and in fact I did. I had two separate lists of eyeshadows that I wanted for myself and a separate list of eyeshadows my friend wanted (5 each, 10 altogether). The MUA took the lists and gathered up all the eyeshadows for me and placed rubber bands around the 5 for my friend and the 5 for myself. \n\nI also decided to buy my friend 5 eyeshadows for her birthday so I ended up buying 15 altogether!! I felt really bad having the MUA go through the drawers and gather all 15 =( BUT she did it with a friendly smile! I'm hoping to come back soon to check out more eyeshadows and maybe some of their blushes. =X\n\nCONCLUSION\nI think you already know what the conclusion is. =)
