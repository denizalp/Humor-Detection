This place was beyond whack, me and my whole group could not wait to leave. \n\nNot only did the music suck, but it was bad enough that hardly anyone was dancing to it. EDM with horrible transitions. They had girls in short dresses standing around on the counters\/tables. They weren't doing anything except looking cute, literally not even dancing lol. They looked awkward and uncomfortable. \n\nFirst, we were booked with a party bus that was taking us to multiple clubs throughout the night for my birthday. This was the first club we were escorted to and the front security guards were complete idiots.. idiots is actually a compliment to how those douche bags acted. We had a group of 10, 6 females 4 males. I was in the back of the group so I was last to get carded. The security asks me to smile and I do so. He keeps staring at my card for hella long then looking at my face THEN says it doesn't look like me. He gets another security guard to look at my card, and that idiot said it didn't look like me either!! I was carded over 15 times that day and this was the ONLY place that looked at my card twice. Every other person wished me a happy birthday. They go through four security guards who all claim it was not me. I can't believe how stupid they were. \n\nOh but it gets better..\n\nFIRST they claimed that the card didn't look like me. THEN they had the nerve to say \"It's awfully close to your birthday...\" suspecting I didn't just turn 21. If I were to make a fake ID, I think I'd made myself a little older don't you think?? And duh! Where the fuck else would I be on my 21st? Chucky Cheese? \n\nIt's funny because another guy in our group turned 21 the day before (I turned 21 four days before) and his ID was expired and they gave him no problems! My bf's ID is from Rhode Island and looks nothing like him and they didn't give him problems either!! \n\nThey called up a sixth dude who didn't even have to look at me twice. He knew the ID was legit and it was me and had no issues. \n\nWasted 20 minutes just to get in and once you're in they don't allow you to sit anywhere. \n\nOh yeah and the couches look like cheap plastic material from the 80's or something. \n\nIf you want a better club check out Chateau.\n\nFuck this place
