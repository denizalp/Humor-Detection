When you come to Vegas, there are certain Hotel\/ Casinos you think of.  Caesars Palace is still the grandaddy of the Strip, and while its a bit old, it still draws the crowds.\n\nThey've built newer towers, but the best location to stay is the Augustus tower, located right by the lobby.  The other towers are located miles away, and frankly its just too far.\n\nThey have everything you can ask for.. .the casino, shows, restaurants with celebrity chefs (ie: Flay, Ramsay), and a huge shopping area which has high end stores like LV to affordable stores like Victoria Secret.  \n\nIts still one of my favorite Vegas locations, and its even better when I get comp'd.
