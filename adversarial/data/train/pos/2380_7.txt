Everyone knows Olive & Ivy has the best patio in the area! Even in the summer heat I like to sit out for the views and the people watching is excellent! I love their brunch menu for the eggs Benedict (I'm obsessed) and I've always heard that the smoked salmon bagel is great as well. Drinks are always good- I prefer their whiskey sour smash personally. They also have a decent wine list including some of my favorite budget Napa wines (Tangley Oaks Merlot for one example). The atmosphere is always trendy without being pretentious and it's a great date spot!
