I love forever 21 and always have! This location is the closest to me but not my favorite. It's always a mess, the visuals as well as the mannequins are always a mess. The visual merchandising is very poor and need big changes and maintaining. \nThe great about the location is the sizing. They carry a lot in stock and always have enough sizes. It's a huge store with plenty to choose from. I always stop in and but a few things when doing my shopping in this center.
