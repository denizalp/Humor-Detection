3.5 stars\n\nI got a deal from MyVegas. Wasn't that much of a deal, since they add tax and resort fee in the end anyway. Considering I was only in Vegas for less than a day, I did not really use any of the utilities that were supposed to come with the fee.\n\nI did not have high expectations for this room, but two things were bothered me.\n1. The blanket\/comforter was SO thin! I was freeeezing my butt off.\n2. AC\/heater is so old and....for lack of a better word...ghetto. It was so old that I had no idea how to use it.\n\nHowever, if you need a \"cheap\" place to stay on the strip, Luxor is a good choice. But I think I will not come back unless I get a really good deal next time.\n\nAlso, the staff was really kind so I would like to acknowledge them for a great check in\/out experience.
