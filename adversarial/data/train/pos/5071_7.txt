You might say I'm a \"regular.\" I absolutely love Bomberos and can be found there with my laptop on a Saturday morning for breakfast, having a lunch meeting during the week, unwinding at the bar after a long day at work or on the patio enjoying the company of friends late into the evening. (Although, not THIS week, because it appears they are closed from 12\/22 - 12\/28. Making up for it with a free wine tasting on 12\/29 though...)\n\nTruly, there's little to add to what's already been said:\nHands down it's the best patio in the Valley - water features in the summer and an awesome fire pit for the chillier months.\nLive music on the patio most Saturday nights gives people a chance to relax or get up and get their Latin groove on.\nInside is urban chic but unpretentious and lets you feel cool for being there no matter how cool you are.\nBreakfast portions are generous and the coffee is awesome (said the self-proclaimed coffee snob).  By the way, my favorite breakfast option made a short appearance on the menu but can still be ordered: salami and Swiss omelet - egg whites only with home fries... yummy!\nLunch offers a half salad - half sandwich option and there's always a \"salad of the day.\" (I can't pick a favorite panini or bruschetta because they're all good but I can say putting manchego on the tuna makes it even better!)\nFree WiFi and it's VERY quite during the day making it easy to have a meeting or catch up on some work.\n\nI remember sitting on a crate in the building that is Bomberos before it was a wine bar and drinking a bottle of whatever my friend picked up from Orange Market at the corner and dreaming about what it would be one day... Christi and Oscar have done a superb job in their first year and I'm so grateful to have such a great place as my neighborhood hang out!
