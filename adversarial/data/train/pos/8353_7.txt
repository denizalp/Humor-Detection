I went here when it was Juniper Grill, and my opinion then was it was good but I wouldn't go back... now that it has reopened as Carnegie Kitchen...  the sentiment hasn't changed.  It's good food, the presentation and quality is excellent, but for me the menu doesn't really fit my palate.  It's a little too much.  I read reviews in the Plain Dealer and other website that describe this as going back to the basics with breakfast and lunch.  Bottom line is the food is anything but simple and anything but the classics.  I ordered the open faced salmon something or other with all this extraneous stuff.  It was good, tasty and seemed pretty healthy. Substituted the fries for the baked sweet potatoes which were great.  Perhaps my real anger is with the reviewers who inaccurately described this place.  Worth a try, but not stopping back.  Where is my classic diner fare in downtown?
