Called the general 866 # in order to see if they were willing to lower my bill. $73 a month for just internet is too damn much. Century Link tells me I can get a 2 year guarantee for the same speeds at $29.99 per month. \n\nFirst try- got disconnected while being transferred to the \"Loyalty Department\".\n\nSecond try- once again disconnected, however the agent I spoke with told me that I can press \"4\" if I have to call back in order to go straight to the Loyalty people. \n\nThird try- I press the number \"4\" at least 4 times but I still don't get transferred to anyone in Loyalty. So, Sarah keeps me on the line this time while she connects me. \n\nIn a minute, I get through to the \"Retention Department\" where I plead my case and I am offered a discount and a 2 year price lock guarantee against any monthly rate increase. It took me about 5 minutes once I finally got through, and it was worth it to save 20% on the 55 mbps premier plan.
