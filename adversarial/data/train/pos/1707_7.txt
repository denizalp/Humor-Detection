***This is a pretty big Las Vegas hotel gift shop (in Bellagio); you will find touristy stuff, toiletries, snacks, sweets, and refreshments; they currently have a special where you can get any 3 bottled waters for $10, which gives you a sense of the high prices here; service was good and personal***\n\nLike most Las Vegas hotels on The Strip, Bellagio offers both free valet and self parking.
