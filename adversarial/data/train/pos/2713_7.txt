I go here at least once every two years whether I want too or not. It usually is not, but I go. \n\nToday was one of those days.\n\nWe arrived probably around 1:20 p.m. and the lunch rush was over; if it had one.\n\nThe young lady took the name and said it will be about ten minutes, ok no big deal. This gave me time to look around again for the first time. The building and the d√©cor is tired and uninviting. It could be really nice if it tried.\n\nOk so this is not fine dining I know that, I accept this.\n\nOur server was Cory; he did a fine job with a very pleasant attitude. \n\nI ordered what was recommended to me by two folks; the Mizithra Cheese and Brown Butter. It is said to be a toothsome treat for cheese lovers. What in Gods name does that mean I have no idea? Nor do I know why a cheese lover would love this dish. I also ordered a salad and cup of soup. Clam chowder was the soup and salty was its name. I beg, please do not give me a wet salad, dry the veggies first and then serve them. As for the toothsome treat it self, well no. Bruce looked over and said; man that looks dry is it missing something? I would not know since I have never had it before, but I do know if this is a favourite dish of anyone they have very low standards in food.\n\nI like good food; I want good food even in a middle of the road place like this. Find inspiration and pass it along to your patrons. I mean if I am going to remain fat I want it to mean something.....
