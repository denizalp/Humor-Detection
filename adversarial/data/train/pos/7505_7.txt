I've been getting Oliveo delivery for a while now, however I've noticed a change in the past few months. I'm not sure if the place is under new management or what, but the food has become hit or miss. \n\nMy absolute favorite thing to order from Oliveo was the Halloumi pita (as a matter of fact, after I tried this for the first time I drove all over town looking for Halloumi cheese!!) . The last time I ordered it, it was not so spectacular. I do love this place, but sometimes the food quality is lacking. Some things are consistently good, like the Greek fries or Chicken Bruschetta pita. All in all, I will still continue eating at this place, the people are friendly (although I miss the old man who used to take orders on the phone..what happened to him?!) lol, and I havent had so many bad experiences that I wouldnt go back. Its not my favorite Greek food but its good on a Friday night when I dont want to cook!
