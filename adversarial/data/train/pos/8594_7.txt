After two trials (at $75 and $150) with Denise Tanigawa, salon owner, I wish I had never booked her for our April 2016 wedding.  I requested two very specific hair styles and natural makeup looks (with photographic examples) but did not receive anything I asked for.  Additionally, I felt that my makeup was overdone and uneven and my hair style was unimpressive for our engagement photography session (after the second trial).  Denise also delegated hair styling responsibilities to random people I did not know or book. \n\nDenise REFUSES to return my $200 deposit even though I canceled her in December!  Isn't that sweet?  Dealing with Denise has been an expensive and frustrating exercise in futility that I am quite bothered by.
