Maybe it was the oppressive heat, maybe the diarrhea brewing in my gut, but I truly hated this place.  Didnt like the long line to get in, didnt like the music, didnt like the misting nozzles driping god knows what bacteria in my beverage, didnt like the 50 year old dude claiming he was 30 something trying to make time.  Anyway, I got the hell out of there and spent some quality time on the toilet.  What happens in vegas stays in vegas.
