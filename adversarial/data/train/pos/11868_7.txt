Who doesn't like a little play house for kids!  THis theater is simply adorable.  Just ripe for fund for children of all ages to sit and watch young budding actors and actresses cut their chops on the stage.\n\nI recommend arrive a little early in order to park close to the theater.  There is a parking lot behind the theater and 2 across the street.  There is pay parking along the streets in the area. \n\nThere is a very limited snack bar with water and snacks that seem to along with the play of the day.\n\nThis is a great place for a summer playdate!  Have fun!\n\nReturn factor 100%
