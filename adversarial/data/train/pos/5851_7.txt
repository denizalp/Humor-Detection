Nice enough hotel... but what I don't appreciate is this: I am here attending a training conference for a couple days. This is the 2nd evening in a row that I, out of handfuls of other guests simply trying to return to our rooms, have been picked out to furnish my hotel room key. I was not happy about this last night and less tolerable about it tonight so I spoke up. The security guard gave an explanation referring to policy, however since last night, I have made a point to watch group after group and person after person pass through to the elevator without being singled out as I was. I'm not one to make a scene but I'm Sick of giving the benefit of the doubt and playing devils advocate and looking the other way! This is unacceptable and I'm not going to stand by silently and cooperative anymore!!  So I'd like to say, Suncoast Hotel, exercise your policies consistently without differential or suffer the backlash and repercussions. I will not be returning nor speaking positively, to say the least, of this establishment in my personal or professional life moving forward. I hope you employ some sort of digital marketing specialist that will read this and take my experience and frustration to heart. \n\nRegards,\n\nA Henry
