I would never recommend this place to ANYONE! I was rear ended last year by a 23 year old boy that was in the car with all his friends, who was not paying any attention. Long story short....1 year later we finally went to \"arbitration\" & I lost my case. This \"young man\" was caught lying twice in front of the Arbitrator and I lost my case. The attorney I had was Jacob....maybe someone else would have better or more educated & been able to be an ATTORNEY and actually fought for my case...overall, I have never been rear ended & overall would never recommend this place to ANYONE!!!
