One word \"Grateful\"\n\nOne of the most caring clinics I have been too. The entire staff is courteous, professional and very knowledgeable. I am so happy to be a patient here and would not go anywhere else as long as my insurance stays in effect.\n\nAnd thank you to \"Minnie\"\nShe is so sweet, smart and kind. Proud to say she is my doctor.\n\nHighly recommend\n5 Star all the way!
