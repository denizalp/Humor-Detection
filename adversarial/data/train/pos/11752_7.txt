I have a hard time giving a fast food establishment five stars, I mean, that is ludicrous. But I must...dangit. I have had ups and downs here but the ups outweigh the downs as they have always made it right and gone above and beyond on the \"down\" occasions. I got the five buck surf and turf basket (fat kid here at heart) the order was perfect, Popeye's Chicken is the Shiznit, just let it slide down your throat (if you've watched the movie 'Little Nicky\" you know what I am talking about) well, it's true. The shrimps were good, the chicken was perfect and fresh. I received an adamant amount of the sauces I requested and also when I asked what she suggested, she said, oh, you have to add cocktail sauce, so got some of that too! The customer service was on point and friendly and my belly was full of cheaply priced, quality food, nicely prepared packaged goodness :)\n\nPopeye's, can we please bring back the sugar cookie coated chicken...soooooo freakin' oddly good, love it!!! :)
