This is my weekend recovery spot.  Sunday and\/or Saturday mornings (yeah, right, more like afternoon) my gusband and I walk to LGO (also serves as an excuse for a workout... a workout that ends with tuna sandwiches probably isn't effective).  We sit outside and enjoy the beautiful weather, pretending to be on vacation.  \n\nFood-\nCommuter Sandwich with bacon- I die.  I've never tasted bacon so delicious.  \n\nTuna Sandwich- sliced cucumber and apple give it a fresh taste that makes me forget I'm essentially eating a bunch of mayo.\n\nSome salad I don't remember the name of- tangy, spicy, Asiany.  It wasn't really worth remembering, but it wasn't that bad either. \n\nGreen Chili Mac-  My weakness.  Who can resist gooey cheese and green chili?  Not me, that's for sure.\n\nCroque Madame- Gruyere cheese and a runny yoke, my two favorite things.   \n\nI pretty much just rotate the above, except for the Asiany salad. \n\nThe only reason I don't give this little gem 5 stars? Service.  Some of the employees have been down right rude, like the customers are annoying for trying to order something.  It makes it hard on me because my gusband can be a bit feisty and when there is a bitch behind the counter I know I will have to play peace keeper.  Not fun.  Stop doing that to me LGO.  Just be nice and my gusband won't turn into the hulk... and by hulk I mean a pissed off gay man with an attitude.
