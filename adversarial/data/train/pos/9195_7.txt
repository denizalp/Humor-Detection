Stay away. The food is awful and the service is terrible. I can see why they make you pay first. The fried rice is like mush. it must have been sitting in a warmer for hours. The egg drop soup has so much potato starch in it it was so thick and nasty. Been sitting here for a half an hour after eating the gal has not checked on me once. The heat must not be on at all because it is cold in here. Just slightly warmer than the 50 it is outside. Once again stay away.  My first and last time here.
