This was my first experience at eating a Poke Bowl. I have had something similar in the korean culture style of food. I can say i wasnt dissappointed after eating at this location. I had chicken and fried tofu which made for a delicious combo. The boba in the tea was awful and hard but the thai coffee was delicious. I was able to try the cheese crab sticks which were amazing and earned this review a star on its own. I think that they were a bit over priced for only 2 of them. If coming to this location again i will for sure be having them again. The midnight rice was unusual and delicious all at the same time. \n\nI feel like they added too much rice to compensate for the lack of veggies. Even if you mix the food well you find yourself lacking substance when the only thing left is rice. Its a bit on the medium price range. Other places offer something similar for less. All and all its a cute shop at a home-like location.
