Won an instacontest and finally came to try this place Friday night. I'm really happy with our experience here. The man who worked there was chill, patient and knew the menu very well. We each got a poke bowl. Mine was shrimp with sesame\/wasabi ginger sauces in on all dressed bowl (brown rice, avocado, pineapple, cilantro, edamame, etc). My sister got the tuna all dressed bowl with the island sauce (yum). I definitely preferred the tuna\/island bowl, very strong and delicious flavours. We were also offered 2 drinks so we each tried a kombucha (hibiscus black tea \/ ginger green tea). Kombucha's not for me but I'm glad I tried it. \n\nTucked away near the Jean Talon Market and Little Italy, Ok Poke is worth trying if in the area. Fresh, healthy poke bowls for $9 are the way to go!
