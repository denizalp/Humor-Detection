$20 admission and ladies' entrance is not free. Includes two drinks... does include booze, but you have to get two of the same (i.e., had to get two Miller Lites instead of one beer and one shot). But we had been drinking all day and night so I ordered two plain Cokes and didnt get to finish them because I was so out of it (from the drinking all day) I was chatting up this nice girl with big hoots and buying lapdances and my fiancee grabbed me by the arm and said \"what are you DOOING that chick is GROSSSSSS\" and got me outta there before she could sit on his lap next.
