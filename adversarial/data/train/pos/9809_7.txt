I often find myself having a fashion dilemma: I like to look sharp and stylish, but I absolutely despise clothing shopping. The last thing I want to do is spend a day bopping around from store to store (or worse yet - going to the mall) hoping to find a pair of pants here, a shirt here, some shoes over here, hoping at the end of it all I've have put together something worth wearing. \n\nEnter Less 17 - my new one stop shop for looking so good! Less 17 takes a lot of looks and inspiration from skate culture and makes it a little more grown up. If you were a little skate punk back in your teen years like I was, there's no doubt you had at least a few The Source Skateboards\/Snowboards shirts kicking around your closet. Now that I'm a little older I want something that allows me to blend in with the adult world, but dammit, I'm not ready to lose my edge. Looking good and looking like a downtown 9-5 suit are two very different things. \n\nThey carry several high end denim lines included Naked & Famous, Nudie, and Levi's. I picked up some Naked & Famous Jeans. Super high quality denim that's going to last you a long time. If you're going to spend a lot on jeans, you might as well be spending it on the quality instead of the name brand. They're not flashy - just really good fitting high quality denim. Any kind of clothing where the less you wash it, the better you're taking care of it is alright with me.\n\nFor footwear they carry some cool picks from the classics. For you sneakerheads they carry Converse, Vans, Adidas and more. If a bitchin' boot is more your style they've some excellent high end picks from Red Wing and Wolverine. Both so incredibly nice. I'm saving up starting now.
