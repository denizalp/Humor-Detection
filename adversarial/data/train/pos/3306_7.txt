The music was ok, but it's a very threatening vibe especially if you're a female. I accidentally bumped into a guy waiting in line for the bar who threatened to punch me in the face (he was 6'5\" I'm a small female).it was scary!! Then I was hit on aggressively by at least 5 sketchy dudes including one smoking a crack pipe. Seriously Toronto you can do better.
