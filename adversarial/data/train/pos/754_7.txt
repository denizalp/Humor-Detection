I'm from Cincinnati. By nature I'm supposed to hate Pittsburgh. However, I've had an obsession with Jordan Staal since I was 12, I took a college visit to the U of Pitt, and I DEFINITELY prefer a Primanti Bros sandwich over a 3 way anyday.\n\nChillax, I'm not horny; a 3 way is a Cinci \"delicacy\" featuring spaghetti topped with a very thin chili and cheese. Calm down children.\n\nAnywhoo, whilst making this visit to Pittsburgh, I told my padre it was absolutely necessary we eat here. Why? I've seen Adam Richman, Guy Fieri and every other chubby traveling food dude drool over these. I wanted one. Bad.\n\nWhen you walk in, it's a dive, for sure. Seat yourself, everyone's in sweats, eatin a big hunk o' meat stuffed with french fries and coleslaw.\n\nAn Ohio girl can get used to this.\n\nAt the (also very chillax) waitress's recommendation I took Cappacola, which apparently is a Pittsburgh tradition. My dad took the Tuna Fish, and we waited...ten minutes. My food is here. And it looks AWESOME. My first bite was, orgasmic. Yes, orgasmic. This sandwich turns me on.\n\nSorry 3 way.\n\nBut this...sandwich...is...amazzzzzzzzzzzing! It's spicy, it's crunchy, it's sweet, it's salty, it's...hey there's bread too! ALL IN ONE. My dad also enjoyed his sandwich, at least I think he did. I'm not quite sure. I was into this love affair way too much. If this were considered cheating on a boyfriend, I would cheat. Every week. Maybe everyday, depending on how often I can get to this sandwich.\n\nI love this sandwich. You will too. You will also be full. Oh so very full. You will have coleslaw coming off your chin and french fries overflowing your basket after you're done. And if you do not finish, you will take it home, or to your hotel, or to the spirit shop down the street and munch on the leftover french fries while the cashiers aren't looking because you're not supposed to be eating in there. (SSH!)\n\nIt's THAT good.\n\nP.S.: I got a pen that says Primanti Bros on it. Yeah. Be jealous.
