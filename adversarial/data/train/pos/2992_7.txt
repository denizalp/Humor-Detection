FFS is located off the gigantic Village Center round-a-bout on Trailwood Drive.  It provides all the fuel, sundries you need in addition to car washes.  The service is always friendly and if you prefer there are nice employees out at the pumps asking to fill your tank for you.  Conveniently located next to the 24 hour gym, I would not hesitate to stop if I needed something.
