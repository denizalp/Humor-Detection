The staff were fantastic from the moment we opened the door, and the meal was so good that we asked to visit the kitchen to share our appreciation. \n\nWe had two bison burgers, the mushroom\/Brie (#1 you have to order) and the blue cheese bison burger (still delicious). We started with cheese sticks and apple\/bacon soup (om nom). Definitely ask for the dark German beer!\n\nThe burgers were insanely good. Juicier than you've ever had, you can tell from the flavor that it was never frozen, and you can order them mid rare and they actually get served mid rare!! Fries get cut on location and are blanched to perfection. Even perfectly spiced. \n\nI'll keep this short and sweet, service was incredible (mark and marine), the food blew my companions mind (he's only missing China\/Australia on his culinary visits list) - and he has a usually expensive pallet and the entire experience was not only memorable but will be quoted until this friendship dies. \n\nSkip the apps and grab the Bison Brie burger. You won't be disappointed!
