I was excited to read all the reviews about Jinia. She was very nice and my highlights were fine. I showed her the hairstyles I liked and she understood that I wanted a lot of layers and layers framing my face. \n\nAt my old salon in santa monica it took about 30 min to cut my hair and layer it. Jinia took 3 min, im not exaggerating, it was 3 whole mins. The cost of the haircut and highlights was the same as I would pay in santa monica!  \n\nSo if you get a haircut a barbar can do, then she is great. She gets three stars because she was very nice.
