My wife's brother just got married here. It was a wonderful experience attending as a guest. We enjoyed the ceremony, as well as the reception that followed.\n\nGoogle maps for some reason directed us to the residential area next to the country club. We quickly realized and fixed our route.\n\nThe ceremony:\nThe scenery was quite beautiful. We were outside on the grass adjacent to the golf course. It seems like the perfect place to have an outdoor ceremony. A few people were golfing, but it was not a distraction at all.\n\nReception:\nHors d'oeuvres were served immediately following the ceremony. My family was required to stay with the wedding party in order for the photographer to take pictures. As a result, we missed some of the hors d'oeuvres. I did get to try one of them, the shrimp cocktail. It was nice, succulent, decent sized shrimp.\n\nI have three kids, and we weren't sure if there would be highchairs at the reception tables. A staff member named Lameer was very kind and helped us get two high chairs. Another staffer (forgot his name) was able to sneak us five apple juices, since there were no kid drinks available at the bar. My wife watched the kids while I went to get our dinner plates. A lady staffer offered to help hold one of my plates while I was filling the other. Overall, a very friendly and professional staff.\n\nThe dinner was buffet style. There was an array of items: pasta salad, caprese salad, garden salad, chicken, steak, mashed potatoes, vegetables, and a wide variety of desserts. (I wish I had snapped more food pics, but I was busy watching my kids and just trying to maintain control of them while simultaneously trying to mingle and enjoy the moment.)\n\nIn conclusion, Las Vegas Country Club is a great venue for a wedding and reception. I enjoyed the ceremony and reception despite taking care of three kids. The staff was very accommodating and helpful (which made our visit here much easier).
