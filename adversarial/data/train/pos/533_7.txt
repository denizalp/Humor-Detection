Stayed here as a guest of a VIP guest, who was comped a room. \n\nWe got an upgraded room, which met all our needs. The room was clean, spacious and comfy.\n\nVery casual hotel. You don't get all the hoochies\/douches dressed up walking around the hotel. You also get the old(er) crowd at this casino. \n\nThe smoke is disgusting, but pretty much that's all hotels in Vegas. \n\nBonus that this hotel is on the strip.
