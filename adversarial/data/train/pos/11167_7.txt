Worst customer service I've ever experienced, all because of this snooty check-in girl and the bouncers who think they're almighty just because they work at the newest club in Vegas. \n\nA misunderstanding of what the guestlist rules were between the check-in lady and the promoter led my group of 4 girls to wait for 2 DAMN HOURS, and we lined up on time at 11. Promoter assured me that I could get in fine by showing the entry people his text message. I explained it to the lady but she kept repeating \"No, your promoter told you wrong\" and BS like \"It doesn't work that way\". The girls were under my boyfriend's name so we got him to come out to check in and later she said with massive attitude \"No, I TOLD YOU, you can't do that\". Uhh what the hell is the problem? We have everything we need and we still can't get in? Even when I have ran into bumps getting into the Vegas clubs, the workers were always polite and showed sympathy.. but this chick must have been on her period or something. \n\nMy promoter Lois was very nice and helpful, and rushed over to us to straighten things out. He got things fixed and told us calmly that I should have showed the girl his text, which I DID DO. Looks like she didn't even tell the whole story so she wouldn't look like a fool. She ended up having to let us in and came over with a defeated attitude to give us the comped ticket. Yeah well by this time, the club had to stop taking people in and stopped entry for over an hour. \n\nThanks a lot for ruining our night, you D-list workers. That includes the guard who didn't even have the common courtesy to listen to us and walked away from us mid-sentence. I'd much rather take my business elsewhere like XS or Marquee who treat their club-goers with respect. They actually have room to dance and space to relax.
