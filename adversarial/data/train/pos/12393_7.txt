The 1 star is based on the service.  \nThis is the 2nd time in 3 weeks that I have tried to call in an order and have been put on hold for over 5 minutes. I don't know if they forgot I'm on hold or what. I called back and got put right back on hold.\nToo bad I really liked there pizza & salads.  So long Napoli....
