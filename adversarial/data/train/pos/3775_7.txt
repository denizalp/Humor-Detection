Been on the hunt for the best breakfast spot in Vegas and Mr.Mamas is inarguably one of my favorite breakfast spot in town. I came here on a Saturday morning and place was bustling with people which is a good sign. \n\nService was impeccable. One of the guy (owner?) opened the door for us as we were walking towards the entrance with a warm greeting. Place was packed but they got more than enough servers to take care of everyone. A lady came by our table and introduced herself, I'm assuming she is also the owner? Her name was something along the line of Katherine or Kathy (why am I so bad with names...smh),  I can't remember but she was extremely friendly and welcoming. \n\nI was craving something sweet so I ordered their Mama's French Toast, which comes with 5 generous slices of toast with 3 eggs, and a choice of sausage\/ham\/bacon. French toast was dusted with powdered sugar but did not have any sweetness to itself. I put maple syrup to sweeten up the toast a little but quickly realized their maple syrup is not sweet at all.\n\nToasts were rather dry and the dish overall was forgettable. Bacon was crispy and eggs were cooked to my liking. \n\nIn conclusion, I would give 3 stars for the food itself but based on their top-notch service, I am bumping it up to 4 stars. Thank you and will be back again!
