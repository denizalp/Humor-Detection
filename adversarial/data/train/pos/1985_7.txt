Ikea is like going on a adventure! Be prepared to spend a lot of time here because they have it all. \n\nI've bought some furniture here and I can't complain about the quality. My kids rooms are full of their furniture and it's taken their abuse, so that's a plus. You can furnish a room for less than a grand...yes, please!!\n\nYou can't leave Ikea without at least trying their meatballs once. The other stuff they sell is pretty tasty too. I've never had a complaint about their food. \n\nAll in all, you have to at least stop by once!
