First off this place sucks - I'm a foodie & have tried PLENTY of restaurants. This was a mistake \n\nUpon arriving my friend & requested the patio as it seems to be the talk of the town and the ONLY rooftop patio in Brampton right?! We were told it's at capacity & there would be a 40 minute wait. We took a quick peek at the menu and decided to settle for indoor which was bland to say the least. Fairly mixed crowd, quiet - no music(that I could hear at least), crowded\/seating, bare walls, no colour etc etc. There are a couple really cool pieces of art on the wall of old downtown brampton. My friend and I agreed that maybe they should have a little blurb underneath to explain the history or at least tell us what year that photo was taken.\n\nI decided to try my luck and ask a second time about the patio seeing as we noticed more than a handful of people leaving from the upstairs. The server who I asked said she would check then disappeared for quite awhile. She came back and asked myself and my friend if someone had been to help us yet? I reminded her that SHE had already seated us and promised to check on the patio situation, so for the second time she left to check. Lucky\/unlucky for us there was a seat for two... and then some, so I was a little confused as to why we were told 40 minutes out the gate.\nPatio was cute with much more potential than downstairs but there were no heaters and it was a little chilly. Our server messed up on the drinks to start with, but she was sweet and apologetic. Halfway through the drink we decided to move back in as it was quite cold.\nWe were seated upstairs on the second level between the patio and downstairs, which again was bland and not being used to its full potential. There is a fireplace stationed directly to your right as soon as you reach the top step coming from the first level which is beyond me because its an awkward place near the stairs and there are no tables there so no-one is going to feel that heat - genius. There are about 4 different types of chairs at the tables which looks tacky as well. \nMy friend ordered the \"jerk chicken sandwich\" which was overcooked, underseasoned, came on a ROCK hard ciabatta bun... boring.\nI ordered the \"shaami kabob chicken sliders\" & \"parmesan dusted fries\". The server brought me out mac & cheese instead of the fries which was quickly and easily corrected. Sliders were disgusting. So overcooked, so dry, so gross. Parm fries were Terrible. Really dry and cold! Burnt from the grease, and no Parmesan? \nWhen leaving; my friend and I saw 3 chefs come outside the back for a smoke break. The one guy came over to us to compliment my friends bike... and he was clearly strung out. Drunk or high? Maybe no sleep from partying the night before? Either way it made sense why my food was so shit.\n\nAll in all this place has SO much potential to be the new happening spot for brampton\/downtown brampton. Its a great location and there is ample room inside to work with, unfortunately the owner\/management doesn't see it the same way. Its as simple as throwing a tea light on the table, dim the lights slightly, change the music genre\/volume to create an ambiance. I'm really not even sure what kind of vibe they are going for here, its quite awkward. \nThis place used to be a dope cafe with an art gallery upstairs - too bad, so sad.\nNeedless to say I will not be returning to this spot, its way too bland and crap food.
