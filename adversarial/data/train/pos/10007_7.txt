I had to take a star away.  I ordered the Teriyaki Chicken rice bowl and was very disappointed, it tasted really strange and really soggy.  My co-worker said it best, he said it tasted like a frozen meal heated. \n\nI'll stick with the 5 star wraps and salads and leave the 2.5 star bowls for them to keep.
