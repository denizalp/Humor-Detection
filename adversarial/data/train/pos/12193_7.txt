I rarely review services unless I find it absolutely worth my time to either rant or rave. I will say this much... The store itself is fine. It is clean, bright, and well-stocked. The associates were all very friendly, minus a little Miss Mindy. And it just so happens she was the one to help me with my transaction. She was rude (\"Well, I told you the iPhone would come out to $88 after taxes before I went to the back to get it!\"), degrading (\"Why do you want International access? You wanna call Mexico or something?\"), and bossy (\"Don't touch that or the security sensor will go off.\") Well, my dear, that is what you are there for. In the event that the alarm goes off on one of your non-operable display phones, those little keys you keep around your wrist on the spiral chain to make yourself look important are used to stop the alarm. I truly hope a manager reads posted reviews regarding their stores, because Miss Mindy needs ettiquette classes. I understand the economy is tough right now, but Lord Almighty, if you hate your job that much, try to find another. As I was leaving, the other associates looked as if they wanted to say, \"We're so sorry\". Well, AT&T friends, I'm even more sorry you have to spend 8 hours a day with the witch.
