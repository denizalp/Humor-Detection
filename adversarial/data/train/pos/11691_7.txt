My boyfriend suggested singing Karaoke as a date. I was hesitant at first even though I love singing because I didn't think it'll be fun with two people (I usually go in a large group). However, I had a blast! We got a small room which was $25\/hr which is alright (I would be happier if it's $20\/hr like some of the karaoke place around Bathurst and Bloor). The room was clean and the song selection was incredible. I can't wait to come back for another round of karaoke AND to hear my boy hitting those high pitch notes!
