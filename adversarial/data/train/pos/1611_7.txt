You guys, why does your bar smell like poop poop? Like straight up, you left the door leading down to your anal sewage area open to the bar and and I was there for Karaoke and wanted to sing my songs without the kaka scent hitting the back of my throat. And it was hard times to really enjoy myself. It doesn't have to be like this #justsayin\n\nThankfully, your whiskey sours dulled the pain. Made with fresh lemonade and oh so amazingly tart, and also topped with freshly whipped egg whites, mmmmm foamy foam. They went down easy and I ordered like 3 and got wonderfully buzzed. \n\nCome here for the expertly crafted whiskey sours and end up staying for the poop poop smell.
