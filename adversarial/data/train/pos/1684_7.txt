A much quicker dining experience at this location compared to the one located at LinQ. \nI love their Chicken and waffles, one of their more popular dishes, but I think the Sage Chicken won me over this time. \nPerfectly fried chicken with biscuits and red potato mash, smothered in a chipotle gravy. The portion is gigantic and shareable. \nA great breakfast or brunch spot in Vegas that is worth a visit!
