If you want to feel like a valued customer go here. If you want awesome hot dogs go here. If you want entertaining during your lunch time go here. Literally everyone that walked by was like \"hey Vic\" or \"what's up chili man!\" It was quite entertaining. \nI got the life changer and my husband got the backside destroyer (hopefully it doesn't live up to its name...for my sake). After we devoured our hot dogs in less than a minute we went back and got the special which was a Greek dog. Sooooo good! Go here!!!!!!!\nBest hot dog in Charlotte and we basically have eaten all the hot dogs.
