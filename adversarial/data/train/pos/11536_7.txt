So... my fiance and I decided to check this place out since the grand opening was today. To be honest, I was a little skeptical about eating at a restaurant in a grocery store. I was proven wrong! This restaurant is fantastic. The reason for the 4 stars is strictly for the prices. \nThere are a bunch of beers on tap from the local breweries as well as wine. I decided to do the 4 beer flight to try out some new beers. I decided that my favorite out of the four was the Magic Hat #4. I took the tasting sheet as a note to self. Of course, we went there to eat too so Jeff ordered the Kale salad and I ordered the burger. While we were waiting for the food, i decided to check out the wine section of the store. Holy Cow! I found a bottle of Moscato for $3.99.\nOnce the food came out, I did have to send the burger back to be cooked a little longer because it was definitely not medium but the waitress asked if I would like something to munch on while I wait. I decided to try the tater tots. Unfortunately, they came out with my burger but those were the best taer tots in the world. They were made with cheese and chives and were as big as my thumb. I was in heaven. Then I bit into my burger and I was sold. It was so juicy and melted in my mouth. The smoked paprika aioli that they put on it was fantastic and really brought out the flavor of the burger. I had to slow down at one point because I was chowing down.\nOur waitress was so nice. When Jeff asked for the check, she told us that it was taken care of because I had to send the burger back and the tots were sent out with the burger instead of before. We were both in shock because we are not those people that complain to try and get a comped meal. Let's just say that she got a nice tip. I will definitely go back to try more of the wonderful looking food and sample some more beer.
