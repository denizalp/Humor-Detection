I like this Forever 21! Compared to the crap ones I had to shop at in Minnesota, you guys should be grateful LOL!\n\nThis is definitely one of the largest ones I have ever been to. This place gives you options upon options upon options! It would almost be overwhelming, if not for me being a veteran shopper and all ;)\n\nThe key focal point any baller-on-a-budget MUST check out is the huge clearance section, located in the back corner of the upper level. Not a particularly great place to score discount shoes or pants (all the shoes were the leftover size 10's and 11's), but for tops, it's the best!!\n\nThe staff are great. At least the girl that assisted me was. And she was SOOOO friendly, cheerful, and helpful. I wish I could remember her name, 'cuz she was awesome! If you can't find something, just ask one of these handy folks instead of pacing around aimlessly for three hours.\n\nI love the fact they have a photo booth in the middle of the store too. I mean, what other stores do you ever see that in?! I can't wait to try it out one of these days.
