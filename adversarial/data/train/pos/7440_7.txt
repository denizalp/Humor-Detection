The competition between local escape rooms is strong, but Lost Games may be my favorite so far. Having been to 4 other escape rooms in the city, I think I have a good idea on what's good and what's bad. Lost Games, you were great. \nAll of their rooms (currently they only have one) are based on an Asylum theme. Unlike other escape rooms, the theme starts when you walk into the establishment. It really put me in the mood and I loved the creepy feeling they had. I only wish the front desk workers were in an orderly costume! It would be the perfect final touch ;) \nThey are a \"horror\" themed escape room, but think creepy not jump scares. Their response to me asking if I should expect anything to move\/jump out, they said that if anything moves\/jumps it's not them and something is wrong, haha. \nThe level of detail and the construction of the game pieces were on point. You couldn't guess random combos and bypass puzzles and there wasn't anything that was broken\/stuck. It really ruins the mood when the only reason you couldn't guess a puzzle was because of a broken\/missing piece. \nI can't wait for the other rooms to open!
