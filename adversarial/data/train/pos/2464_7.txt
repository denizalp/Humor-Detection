On the way home from Osaka, we were coming down Durango and I suddenly remembered the Talk thread about Thrifty's Ice Cream. I just had to stop in to see what the fuss is all about. I ordered a pint of Chocolate Malt Crunch for $3.99. I don't think I got a full pint, but that's OK. I ate it all in one sitting, so the guy that filled the tub probably saved me some calories by not packing it in.\n\nYes. I can see why people love this ice cream. It basically tastes like it is full of crushed Maltesers. It was absolutely delicious.\n\nBy the way, I was there past midnight and I wasn't sure if the ice cream section was closed, but the guy was willing to serve me anyway. Teri C mentioned in her review that they stop serving at 10pm. I guess your mileage may vary.\n\nI'm giving Smarty's Mart four stars. Thrifty's isn't the absolute greatest ice cream ever made, but for appearing to be the only one in town that carries it, they have earned my fan status.
