Apparently this is a burgeoning local chain, and few could soundly complain about that, especially with Candy Rama long gone, the void left in its wake begging to be occupied by something joyful and toothsome. \n\nKay and I stopped in one rainy Saturday afternoon in search of sweets (something Tavern 245 doesn't offer) and found an array of chocolates and oddball penny candy all neatly organized and temptingly displayed. Interesting and educational conversation (what I didn't know about what went into chocolate production!) was also had with the franchise's engaging owner Jon Weston. \"Katie\" is his youngest daughter. \n\nWanna try something weird? Get some chocolate sponge candy, something I swear I've never seen in a glass case anywhere in the Pittsburgh area.\n\nPop in. Leave with a bag of goodies under your arm and a smile on your lips.
