I completely forgot to post this!\n\nAwful! This place dropped flyers in our hotel so we decided to try it. My sister called and ordered a pizza a little after 930. The person on the phone said it would take 45 minutes. It was a force but we went with it because we didn't want to leave our room. Over 2 hours later the delivery guy comes with our pizza. I paid him and after opening the pizza everything was ice cold!  My sister called back to complain and get her money back and the lady said she would send the delivery guy back to return the money but they would need to take back.  Like are you fucking serious!?!  I kid you not, and hour and a half later the driver comes back with our money and to shamelessly take the food back.  This place deserves NO STARS!!! Save your money people.
