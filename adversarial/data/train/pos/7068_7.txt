Why is this place dying??  I've only ordered from just eat so I haven't been to the establishment but based on the food this place is absolutely delicious.  What am I talking about? Their take out containers are littered with stickers bout \"save our restaurant\" and \"we need investors.\" Can someone please give them like hunned gs to get those stickers off ?? Also the food is good. Devastatingly good. I ordered like 3 times in one week... :S \n\nI've ordered a pulled pork roti which was the finest shredded swine I've ever experienced. The Caribbean spices brought that pig to LIFE--I really feel that they took the standard pulled pork recipe and made it their own. *insert the patented paula abdul slow clap with pinky stickin out* I also had the chicken and pork poutines and they're the bee's knees.  Only they're not as frail and feeble as bee knees.   These rotis are THICK and filling. It's like an ordeal to get through them.\n\nEach time I ordered I got 20% off and a free drink or side. Everyone knows that freebies are key.  Everyone wants to get something for nothing. I also got jerk chicken poutine at one point and it was so big omg. So many. \n\nLove this place and I had to consciously stop ordering.  This decision was made after that one time they forgot to send a freebie... coincidence? I'll never tell....\n\n5 Starss!!
