Just got off the phone with a very rude receptionist named Gina. \n\nI asked her what time they were open until today and she said 5:30pm when yelp says 6:00p. \n\nI went ahead and asked her  about the mistake on yelp and she responded that actually 5:30p is when they had their last available appointment time. I told her I wanted to book it for 5:30p and she then abruptly rushed me off of the phone and told me there were no appointments available. \n\nMaybe hire another receptionist to be representing your business? That was absolutely awful!
