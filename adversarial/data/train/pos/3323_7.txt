Nice small zoo. Pros: Nice exhibits. Grounds are clean. We enjoyed the petting zoo. The animals look well cared for. We really liked the aquarium. It allowed us to escape from the heat. The location is great for those living on the west side. The stingray touch pool is a part of the admission fee. You can buy food for the sting rays. Best part is Dillon's KC BBQ is right next door to it. Great barbecue, and check out the huge shark tank inside. Dine with the sharks. Going to Dillon's is worth the trip out there.\n\nCons: It is a little on the expensive side.\n\nThere is a $5 off coupon on their website:\nhttp:\/\/www.wildlifeworld.com\/coupons\/
