Love coming to Hilal grill, lunch or dinner they serve some of the tastiest Indian, Pakistan and Afghan food in Phoenix. The real gem here is the buffet on Friday's for lunch or all day on Sunday. Not sure what you want, try a bite of everything and come back for your faves. Curries, naans, rice, tilapia, chicken, lamb, goat, beef, sweets and salads; I've tried about half the menu and have not been disappointed yet. \n\nA bit on the pricier side, you'll spend about $15 give or take depending on your meal, I don't come often but when I do, they never disappoint!\n\nHappy Yelping Phoenix, eat more naan :-)
