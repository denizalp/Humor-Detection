This place definitely has its fair list of short comings but its over all a decent location.\n\nI like that it is located pretty close to my home and that it's open 24 hours because I'm usually getting off pretty late every night.\n\nI like that they have a bell to ring outside so the employees can buzz you in at night. I think this is a great safety precaution for any 24 hour business and its nice to know the owner cares about their staff.\n\nI do not like that they are always out of stuff when I come after 9PM. It is always stuff I'm really craving too! Like pickles, or avocados, or tuna. I definitely think for a location that has to be open 24 hours they should stock better and help set their employees up for a successful night.\n\nOver all not the worst Subway I have ever been too. Employees are always tired by the time I get there, but they are friendly!
