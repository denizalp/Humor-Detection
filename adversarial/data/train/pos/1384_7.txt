Gyros-nirvana\n\nToday's edition of the Waunakee Yelp Chronicles brings a glimmer of culinary hope to the 53597.  Yes, Waunakee has become destination dining for those folks who have a hankering for that bar time staple, the gyros.  I kid you not.  Old Trader Gus  knows his way around a gyros spit as evidenced by the droves of lunch time diners that converge on a Shell gas station in the middle of nowhere.  \n\nThe gyros meat is the star of the show.  The tender, flavorful pieces of quickly flamed beef and lamb are deftly seasoned with Greek oregano, salt and pepper and topped with a creamy homemade tzatziki sauce.  Toss on some freshly cut tomatoes and onions and cradle it in a soft, fresh pita and you have a weapons-grade gyros that will set you back a mere $6.49.  Good times, good times...\n\nI tend to pass on the fries which are fringe average at best.  Given the massive serving size of the gyros, why dilute the experience?\n\nService is lightning fast.  Even during the peak of the lunch hour crush, my gyros is generally ready by the time I finish paying the cashier.  And the restaurant is extremely clean, exceptionally so by gas station standards.  \n\nOne tidbit of bad news: you won't be able to get your bar time gyros fix since Athens Gyros closes at 10pm.
