What happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas.... and for me it was because my memory left me somewhere after the 3rd stiff drink lol. My cousin, her 2 girlfriends and I went away for the weekend and stayed at the Palms. We had originally booked a regular room but was upgraded when we checked in at the front desks. Sweeet!! We got upgraded to the fantasy suite floor and our neighbor just 2 doors down was the Playboy suite -unfortunately Heff wasn't home :( The Palms offered us everything we needed: clubs with free acess ( because we were guests @ the hotel) and good restaurants. We left the hotel only once to go to the strip to peruse around at the shops and it was a quick $5-$9 taxi ride away. Later that night we made off like bandits with free drinks all night and somewhere between Moon and our room, my cousin lost her sole inserts!lol. We all woke up the next morning wondering what time and HOW we got back to out room!?!? No one could remember lol. Personally I believe that's a good indication of a good night out with the girls. That's another reason I love the Palms. You can party it up, get drunk, and not have to worry about making it back to your hotel and wondering around looking for a taxi. All we had to do was find the elevator and up it took us to our room.
