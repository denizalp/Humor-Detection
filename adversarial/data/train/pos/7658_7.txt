[LOCATION] - 5\/5\nThis place is located on Kennedy Rd and Highway 7 in Langham Square (the plaza with T&T Supermarket). \n\n[SERVICE] - 5\/5\nOur server was very nice and friendly. Our order arrived to our table very quickly as well.\n\n[DÃ‰COR] - 3\/5 \nAverage. Clean and modern decor with posters for their Signature Dishes in Chinese (items are also on the English menu). \n\n[QUALITY] - 4\/5\nWontons were delicious and noodles were cooked perfectly. Such a simple and comforting meal.\n\n[ORDER] - 4\/5\n- Shrimp Wonton Noodle In Soup - $6.00: texture of wontons were nice and bouncy, noodles were al dente, and soup did not taste too salty. \n\n- Two Kinds of Toppings Noodle In Soup - $7.00: we chose the shrimp wonton and beef brisket. The wonton and noodles were the same as the one from the shrimp wonton noodle soup. The beef brisket was tender and cooked very well! Definitely worth the price. \n\n[OVERALL] - 4\/5\nI think they perfected their signature shrimp wonton and noodles. The only that that would make this dish better would be some veggies to add a hint of freshness. Other than that, I would definitely recommend Wonton Chai for those who want a simple and delicious meal.
