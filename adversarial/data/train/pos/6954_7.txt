These guys are greedy. You MUST book your tickets online (no orders accepted in person or by phone). Then they have the nerve to charge you $2 per person in service fees (this is in addition to the $28, plus tax, that you are already paying). Ridiculous!!  \n\nMy advice is to go elsewhere, save your money, as this place is way overpriced.
