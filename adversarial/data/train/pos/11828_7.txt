This summer has definitely taken its toll on me. The day that my fat jeans become a little snug is the day that I join another freaking gym. \nI need a gym that's close to home so I feel guilty if I pass it and don't stop. The options are pretty limited in the Western burbs. I had already gotten into World War III with Urban Active, and I don't feel like paying over $100 a month at EMH. So we settled on the Avon YMCA. $61 a month for a resident family membership is a decent deal, and its a brand new facility. I'll have to admit, I almost bolted the day we went and signed up for the membership when I saw the lobby filled to the brim with rugrats running around and screaming. The girl at the front desk said it was fall swim class registration and its normally not that hectic. I was wary, but believed her. And thankfully she was right. \nThe gym area is open and bright, and each machine has its own tv and ipod dock. There's nothing I like more than catching up on my reality tv while breaking a sweat! There is an abundance of Precore ellipticals, treadmills, weight machines and a free weight room (which is mostly filled with Avon HS meat heads so I stay away). There is also a spin room and a group exercise room. I haven't taken a spin class yet, but I am hooked on their Zumba classes. So fun! The instructors, Frankie and Renee, are both great! The classes fly by because you are so entertained - definitely a must try for the ladies!
