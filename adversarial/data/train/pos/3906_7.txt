Ok true story...\n\nI drove all the way to LV (from the OC) w\/ my girlfriendsto eat here.  \n\nThis place is AMAZING!!!!  Every time I'm in town I have to stop by here & grab something to eat.  Whether it's the manchego mac & cheese, filet mignon sliders, stuffed mushrooms, steak & mushroom skewers, seared ahi skewers, etc....I just gotta have something!  Their sangria's awesome too & their mojitos are muy excellente!\n\nThe prices are fair, the music is great, & the food...well it's just so damn good you'd be a fool not to try it.
