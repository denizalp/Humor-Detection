What makes this Congee Wong different than other locations??\n\nThe variety of the menu? There is a different special menu for breakfast, afternoon tea, dinner. Breakfast and afternoon menus are similar to what offers in a Hong Kong Style Cafe. And for dinner, there is option from entree menu that offers even fresh seafood from the fish tank!\n\nI was here twice: lunch and afternoon tea since it opened and both time my experiences were A-OK. Decent food at a great price and friendly fast service!\n\nThere are also quite a few tables that are good single diner like me. \n\nI will be coming in for a quick bite quite often when I am in the neighbourhood which will be almost every week!
