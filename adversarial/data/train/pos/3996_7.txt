I'm not sure how this place operates at night, but as a brunch place, it's absolutely lousy.\n\nWe had to seat ourselves, track down our own menus, and wait 10 minutes every time we requested anything.  It wasn't even busy, so I'm not sure what the reason was.\n\nThe food was something that I could have easily made at home. We got charged $0.75 for salsa that was offered to us. Our waitress basically ignored us until we asked her to come over, and even then it would take her 10-15 minutes to show up.  Asking for a cup of coffee was like asking them to embark on a quest to track down the holy grail and present it to us.  Oh...and for such crappy service, they make sure to tack on a 15% gratuity at their discretion.  Excuse me, but you did not earn that.\n\nBoooooooooo!!!
