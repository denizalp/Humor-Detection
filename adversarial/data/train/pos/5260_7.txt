This review is for Sushi only. Personally if I go to a sushi bar I wont order anything but sushi. The person next to me did have some kind of burger and it was huge and looked really good. If your a sushi lover and If you have ever been to EEZ fusion in Birkdale village(SAME OWNERS) and enjoyed it then you will love Cowfish. The sushi at Cowfish and EEZ is the best around. They have the freshest sashimi and the biggest and tastiest rolls. In addition to the sushi you have to try the crab rangoon dip. The dip may actually be better than eating a crab rangoon itself. They drizzle a special sauce over the fried wontons to start and you can eat the wontons plain the sauce is so good. There sushi bar is pretty cool as well. They have screens on the bar that you can play all kinds of games. \n\nI could really care less but the only drawbacks about the restaurant is that the bathrooms are extremely small. One bathroom is for only one person at a time. The parking is a bit limited as well. Unless your lucky and find a spot in front of the restaurant you will have to park in the garage. The garage is about a block away. They do have some good sake's. If you a sake enthusiast however then the sake list seems a bit more limited then what EEZ carries. But for being in a new area like South Park the list may grow as they develop and learn the clientel that will come in.
