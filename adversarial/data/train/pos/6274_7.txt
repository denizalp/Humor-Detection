Once the ABC was revamped and remodeled, we loved it... it was a fun little spot with decent service and with an overall good vibe.  That quickly changed on one night... long story short, someone slipped stuff into drinks... and thankfully knowing I was not feeling well, I took a cab home... \n\nLadies, beware if you are in this place and if you are there, guard your drinks like a hawk!  You can have a much better and safer experience elsewhere.
