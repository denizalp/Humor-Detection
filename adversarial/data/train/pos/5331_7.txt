This shop is adorable! I had several flavours including vanilla ice cream (too sweet for my taste), original frozen yogurt, salted caramel (my favourite), and pi√±a colada. Wide range of flavours and I love the assortment of toppings -- the best being waffle cone crumbs!!!! They even have free churro samples which taste amazing with your froyo. My only complaint is that it's pricey. My bill came to $5. It was delicious but with my student budget I can't afford to frequent here. I also saw that they had wifi but could not find the password (maybe I'll try asking next time), so I couldn't stay long to work (a shame because the interior is wonderful)!
