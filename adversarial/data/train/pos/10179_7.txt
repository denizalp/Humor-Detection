The go-to for Greek food in Phoenix. \n\nI've been coming here for over a year now and it continues to be incredible. I have only been to George's Kitchen for lunch. I have my favorites established between their lunch special pitas (gyro or chicken). Their fries are some of the best in town and they have free baklava bites to finish off the meal. The owners of the restaurant are always nice and greet me upon entry. \n\nYou'll be seeing more of me George's Kitchen!
