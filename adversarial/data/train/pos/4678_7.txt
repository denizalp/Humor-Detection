Holy Smokes! I've been to LGO for every conceivable meal of the day as they're in my neighborhood ... and somehow I've failed in my writing of The Review.\n\nI'm a terrible person.\n\nThe first time I knew I had a problem involved overnight guests. Somehow they assumed I'd be churning out pancakes and percolating coffee early in the morning. HECK NO. I pushed my friends down the stairs (pfft! to their protests) and off we went. Once they had coffee in their hands and were ready to contemplate making a breakfast order, things were good. \n\nSure, I could have turned on the Martha Stewart charm. But why bother? I have LGO in my neck of the woods. Anyhoo, here's a tip, which is going to kill me to share. There's no need to wait in that monster line in the middle of the store to place a food order. It's true. You can place a food order at *any* cash register. \n\nI just died a little. Everyone that knew that secret now hates me. (So yes! Head on over to the coffee area and place your food order.)\n\nWhelp! An update as I've been prompted. Yes, there are two distinct sides to this operation. The \"Grocery\" (right side) where you queue up for breakfast and lunch. The \"Pizzeria\" (left side) where there is everything else. But I don't see a distinct separation. So my review below is of my top faves. Yes, you have to order the items below on the left side. But you can eat them any where you'd like! When you order breakfast\/lunch you usually end up meandering over to the left anyhoo, so there ya' go!\n\nFOOD\nI'm already a notoriously long writer. So I'm just cherry picking two favorite food items. The roasted chicken and the smoked salmon salad.\n\nPor quoi?\nWell, I had never eaten a roasted chicken quite like the the one prepared at LGO. My supermarket special, which I thought the high heavens of, opening the bag and sighing as I absorbed the heavenly, delightful, smell? That was nothing. LGO's version is an experience. The chicken sighs as it falls off the bone, the skin greeting me with a light crispiness.  If I could recommend anything to pair with this, it would be the caprese salad.\n\nWait? Did I say salad? I found Phoenix's best salad *ever*. The smoked salmon salad was so delightful my dining companion can't wait to order it his next visit. A manly man. Imagine that. A salad that a guy is gung ho on ;) All kidding aside, this salad was filling, fresh and offered a diversity of textures. All while being healthy. Sometimes salads can be...too rich. There was no \"to go\" box. I ate every crumb to my leggings capacity. \n\nDESSERTS\nI stop in here often for cupcakes and their miniature versions when I have a need to impress. Yes, I cheat that way. (Don't tell my Mom!) A box of their artistic works not only look delightful, they taste delicious. Their chocolate chip cookies with sea salt are ginormous. (And dangerous!)\n\nDESIGN STYLE\nThe first time I visited I was awestruck by the novelty of the store in restaurant concept. (I'll update my review to show Instagram photos from here.) It's just the coolest place filled with the neatest things. If you need a gift to to buy, I'm sure you can find it here. They stock books, cards, t-shirts, mugs, candles, purses, you name it. I bet their buyer has thought of it. (They even have a special section for children's gifts.) \n\nWINE\/BEER \nOn the Grocery side (right side) of the store where the shopping is there is wine and beer you can buy. Had I not been with a regular I would have missed the obvious. Buy your beverage, meander to your table, drink it. (No fee!) Glassware is in the middle of the restaurant.\n\nPARKING & MISC\nSo yes, this restaurant is popular. Parking can be tight. (But there's now additional parking on 40th & Meadowbrook.) They are bike friendly too! If you have called an order in, don't fret. They have short term parking. Noted clearly with signs and diagonals on the pavement.\n\nClearly, I {heart} this place :)
