Great park for many outdoor activities!\n\nThis is a really great park for any age.  They have a nice paved trail surrounding the water.  I love to use this for running and biking. Along the route you'll pass picnic areas, basketball courts and well kept grassy areas.  They don't want you to feed the birds as you will see many of them hanging out either in the grass or taking a swim.  \n\nThey have plenty of paved parking to this beautiful setting.  If you're nearby, take advantage of Cornerstone!
