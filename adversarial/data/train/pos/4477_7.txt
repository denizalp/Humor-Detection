Remember High School football when there was the A & B Freshmen teams? Well Big City is on my B Team. I go here when my top choice is swamped.\n\nThey have a decent selection of Bagels and assorted breakfast type sandwiches and sodas. There is a nice outside patio.\n\nThe major problem I have with this place is that they don't understand the phrase \"EZ    on the Butter\". Invariably I have to sponge off the extra gobs of butter from the Bagel. It must be a New York thing. Someone please pass me the secret code.
