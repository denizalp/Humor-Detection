It is time for an expedition to Tempe Marketplace. What will I need?\n\n1.) Earplugs to block out the abysmal 1990s music incessantly blaring from its speakers.\n\n2.) A bottle of chilled water to drink while traversing its endless parking lagoon between \"District\" and \"Grande Boxes.\"\n\n3.) An empty wallet so I don't buy all the mass-produced cr#p for sale.\n\n4.) A full stomach so I am not tempted by chain restaurants with mediocre food, but amazing \"flare.\"\n\nLast, but not least....\n\n5.) Airplane tickets to a real \"marketplace\" in Europe or Latin America for all the consumer drones wandering around this depressing place.\n\nTempe Marketplace, you are a \"FAIL.\"
