This is a walk in clinic located inside the Boxgrove Medical Arts Center. The receptionists, nurses and doctors are friendly. It is also quite quick (for all my visits I was done within 1 hour). They can also check right away the results when they do a throat swab ( compared to other places who say they will call you if there is something). So whenever I do not feel well, I feel very confident in returning to this clinic.
