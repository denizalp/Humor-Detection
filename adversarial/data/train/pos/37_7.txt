Am I the only one on the planet that isn't into it? \n\nNaturally I'm not the type to spend hours going from store to store but let's put that aspect on the back burner for a second. \n\nIt'll take me almost an hour to get there. Once I'm there, I need to park about 63km away from ANY entrance because all of Quebec seems to be shopping at this one place. \nThen I have to elbow other women to get that one last pair of size 4 pants. Honey, just take them. I won't break my nose over those pants. \nDon't forget the fact that women WILL body check to get in front of you to walk into ANY store. \nSo at this point, I'm sweaty, I'm bruised and I have no pants....\nAND THEN I HAVE TO WAIT IN LINE TO WALK INTO A STORE? I'm pretty sure the security guard at Bath&Body was the same bouncer that used to work at Dome.... But that's besides the point. \nI usually walk about of this outdoor \"outlet\" completely exhausted, cursing and completely empty handed. \nI'll stick to my online shopping. At least I won't break a limb.
