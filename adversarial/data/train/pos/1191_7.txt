I've always had a great time when I've come here. The bands they bring in are always great, though it can be quite loud due to the small space that is The Dakota.\n\nThe staff are always on the ball and generally remember you once you've hit the bar for your second round.\n\nMy only complaint is that the building is like a bomb shelter. You don't get any cell service unless you're standing by the stairs.
