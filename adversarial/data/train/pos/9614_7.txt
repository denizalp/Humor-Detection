WHAT HAS PACIFIC MALL BECOME?! It used to be a place that resembled Hong Kong the most, selling products that were in Hong Kong's \"Fa Yuen Street\", bootleg DVDs, just a HUGE variety of things.\n\nNo more sticky picture stores, I don't see many curry fish balls for sale here, not a lot of stationary stores. \n\nAlthough the famous stores are still there, the ones mainly in the middle and a few others like the junk food stores, Taipan, Bank of East China, the rest has changed. Now, it's all about the phone cases, the nail salons, the overpriced bubbletea that doesn't even taste that good. WHYYYYY?!\n\nThe upstairs portion still remains as is though, which I'm pretty glad about. I guess if you walk on over the Market Village, it's still the same, but PMALL?! It just doesn't feel the same.
