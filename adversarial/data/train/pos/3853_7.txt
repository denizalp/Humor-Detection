I found DossEffects online and selected them from the great reviews and the proximity to my office. I needed 5 T-shirts printed in a short period of time with a Russian font. I gave him the vector file and he was able to do a great job printing the T-shirts and I got them in time. Not only that, the price was very reasonable and Steven was very helpful! Thank you very much!
