Coffee is bitter and probably the most expensive I've had in TO. WIFI was 'down'. The macchiato had too much milk, and the cappuchino was served in a large glass; not sure whether in this pseudo-French locale cappuchino translates into cafe-au-lait. But that's what it looked like. \n\nThe waitress behind the bar displayed a mixture of boredom and rudeness. No eye contact. Perhaps she is chronically constipated.
