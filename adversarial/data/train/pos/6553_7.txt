I love the concept of this place. And when it's not a weekend night, it's a fun place to be. On non-weekend nights, it's not too crowded and not too loud. The cocktails pretty much suck. The beer offerings are kinda meh. But you don't come here for the drinks. You come here to play. I particularly like the outdoor area with the giant chess and beer pong areas. It's like a big playground for adults with alcohol. There's no gambling, so it's a nice reprieve from the constant dinging of the slot machines. All in all, I'll consider myself a fan (on non-weekend nights).
