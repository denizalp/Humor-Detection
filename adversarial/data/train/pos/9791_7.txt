I'm a 25 year old athletic female that used to live in NYC. I practiced both vinyasa and bikram religiously while living in the city.  However, when I moved to Cleveland for graduate school my options were limited.  Personally, I'm not a fan of Cleveland yoga in Beachwood due to the lack of yoga knowledge.  Whenever I would attend a class at Cleveland yoga, I felt like it was a lululemon housewife contest with roaring chatter before each class.  And when the classes began I felt like I was being yelled at for an hour.  NOT my idea of yoga or a spiritual experience. \n\nSo I found myself at Bikram Yoga Cleveland and INSTANTLY I was in love.  The instructors are fantastic -- extremely knowledgeable and warm.  They truly appreciate the spirituality aspect of yoga.  The facility was impeccable, especially the yoga room and locker room.  I'm relieved to see more options here in Cleveland.  I will DEFINITELY return!
