Yeah, it's OK. The strippers are definitely straight, and that kinda kills the buzz for me. But they do get fully nude, and \"excited\", so, yeah. I have fun here up until I start getting propositioned for private dances by any and all strippers in the place. Repeatedly. Non-stop. Aggressively. Without my even making eye contact. Other than that, it is fun for an hour or two. It is probably the best a strip club can be, so maybe I just don't love strip clubs. I guess that is not their fault. Definitely check it out.
