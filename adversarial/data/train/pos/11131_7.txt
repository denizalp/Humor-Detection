I've been trying to discover the vegetarian\/vegan scene a bit more so I knew I had to check this place out and it didn't disappoint. \n\nI sat outside so I can't really vouch for how comfortable it is. But their little terrace is only comfortable if you're in the shade. We were seated right under the sun and it was not pleasant. The chairs are metallic so you start to sweat and stick to it and it's not a fun way to have a meal. \n\nService is really quick and the busboy circled many times to give us water (thank god) which is a plus because lots of places forget to refill your water. \n\nWe ordered the vegan burger and pear\/bacon pizza to share and I'm still raving about it. Who knew putting pear on a pizza with bacon would create such beautifulness? The taste is perfectly balanced with a hint of sweet and salty. \n\nThe burger was also delicious. I'm really getting into bean patties because they're so mushy and taste so good with avocado and lettuce. It came with a side salad too with just the right amount of zesty vinaigrette. \n\nExcellent Excellent!!!
