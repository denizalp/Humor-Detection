Coco's is one of those fun, old style breakfast\/lunch places that somehow has managed to survive into the 21st Century -- sadly, others like Howard Johnson's have not!  Today, competitors: Marie Callender's and Bakers Square are on life-support.\n\nWhat they do best is breakfast and lunch, though their dinner menu has recently been updated and looks interesting.  The food is good and is similiar to Denny's in many ways.\n\nThis Coco's is located not too far from Fashion Square, and is near Barney's.
