I think often times people forget about taking the train...in fact I'm guilty of it too...whenever I'm planning a trip I'm thinking airplane, car...even boat but not train! \n\nSo when my dad was planning a visit to see me from Virginia and said he was taking the train I thought that's old school...but very cool! \n\nInitially his train was supposed to arrive at 8:10pm but they had some sort of \"line crossing delay\" and he finally made it in about an hour and a half later...I guess...stuff like that happens. \n\nAnyway, outside the station was a bit sketchy but when I walked in it was clean and like other reviews have said \"old and historic\" Lots of wooden benches, a couple vending machines and the bathroom but hey what more could you ask for while you wait. Lucky for me everyone inside was nice and the people waiting with me were all very friendly. \n\nOverall, my dad said that the ride was good, he was in business class so they gave drinks and they had some food options for him. He liked being able to get up and walk around and having all that freedom...he said he will definitely recommend it! So since it's dad approved...see ya soon  Amtrak!
