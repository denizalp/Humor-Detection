If you desire quantity over quality Fire & Ice is probably already your go-to place. If you enjoy piling badly-chopped vegetables in a bowl as high as you can go, simply to be stir-fried by ready-made MSG-laden sauces, by all means head to Fire & Ice. \n\nIt's pretty much like Mongolian Grill; pick your vegetables, pick your protein, give to 'chef\/stir-fryer' and get your food via waiter. \n\nIt's neither inspiring, satisfying nor is it delicious.
