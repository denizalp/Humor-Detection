I absolutely love this store!! Their style is very similar to J Crew and Anthropologie, except more casual. The regular priced items are a bit too expensive for me, so I always browse through the sales section :) What's great is that they often have an additional 40% off sale items! What's even BETTER is that I can combine that discount with my 15% student discount!! With this combined discount, I can get shirts as much as $20 (original $100!) and dresses as much as $40 (original $120+)! I guess the only downside of buying things on sale is that you can't return them, so make sure you love what you're going to buy before you commit!! They also have very friendly workers. Overall, favorite store in the entire mall :)
