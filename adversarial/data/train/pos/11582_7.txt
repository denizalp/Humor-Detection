This was my first visit to this restaurant. It was a little overwhelming at first because there are so many options. I chose the build your own salad. It was good but my friends went on and on about how good their salads were. So next time I'll probably order one of their specialty salads. Now the really cool part, we all got a piece of French bread. The bread was soft and delicious but that's not all...we each got a chocolate dipped strawberry, a free bonus that I didn't expect! I like little surprises like that!!!
