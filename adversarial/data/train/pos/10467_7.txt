VEGAN review (and a money-saving tip at the end of the review):\n\nCaveman Burgers is a fast food burger joint with options to customize your own burger. Lucky for us vegans, Caveman has a vegan bean patty, bun, and sauces (vegan options are: BBQ, habanero ketchup, and steak sauce... ironically). I asked for the BBQ sauce and the habanero ketchup on the side. I liked both the sauces I tried but the habanero ketchup was my favorite. It's not too spicy but gives the fries and burger a nice bite. \n\nThe vegan bean patty was fried as a way to keep the patty together. I thought it could use more seasoning and definitely more salt, but I appreciated the effort. The sauces can mask the taste of the patty, so I would recommend asking for the sauces on the side. The vegan (and gluten free bun) was fine, but cost an extra $2. \n\nWhat really stood out at our visit was not just the vegan-friendly food, but the amazing service. From the woman taking our orders, to the cook, and the person on the floor, my friend and I received nothing shy of the best service.\n\nTo find Caveman Burgers, it is nestled next to the Jimmy Johns!\n\nMoney saving tip: you can get 20% off with Groupon and 7% off your visit with Yelp by linking your card.
