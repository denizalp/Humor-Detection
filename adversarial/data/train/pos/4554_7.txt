My husband and I went here on a Saturday night at about 9:30pm. It was not very busy but it was so loud, it was ridiculous. There were two \"bands\" playing. One band had a tuba player and it was so loud that it sounded like there was an elephant in the room. I ordered a Diet Coke to start and I wouldn't have mind paying $2.50 for it, except for it came in a can. I think $2.50 for a can of Diet Coke (so no free refills) is way too expensive. In fact, almost everything on the menu was very expensive (most entrees are between $17 and $25), considering that the restaurant itself is very informal (almost like a diner), I thought that the prices were way too high. Between the high prices and the loud tuba, we didn't even stay long enough to order food. \nUnless you like very loud tuba music and like paying very high prices for seafood (given the atmosphere), I wouldn't go here.
