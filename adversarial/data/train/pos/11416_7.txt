Time to freshen up my look!  Bravo Salon is the best place to go in Scottsdale if you want top notch hair salon services.  I rely on Inigo to keep my hair color \"current\" and spice it up once in awhile with highlights.  He is a master at his craft and always listens to his clients about their goals and recommends what cut\/color\/treatment will work best.  \nToday I am in desperate need to spruce up a washed out look.  In addition to a color update Inigo recommended a glaze and deep conditioning. \n\nMichele took great care of me as well with a relaxing shampoo,glaze & conditioning process.\n\nThe results are awesome! Thank you, Inigo and Michele!\n\nI highly recommend Bravo Salon!
