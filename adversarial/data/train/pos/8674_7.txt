So my sister was leaving town last Friday and we had not made our way to Crystal's (City Center) right next to Aria Hotel. Is it Crystal's?  Is it City Center?  Too many names and confusing!\n\nAnyway, we sat at the bar where HAPPY HOUR is offered all the time. \n\nBartender took his sweet time to take our order and there were only two other people sitting at the bar. It was only like 3 p.m.  \n\nIt took him 15 minutes to get our drink ORDER.   We were sitting at the bar?\n\nFINALLY he took our order, I ordered the stuffed peppers with goat cheese.  These are tiny nibbles so don't expect a huge portion. The pepper is the size of a grape.  But the flavor is fantastic.  I LOVE GOAT CHEESE. They drizzle some olive oil on it so for me, it was perfect.  We had some red sangria which I recommend and the pizza with Arugula and mushroom. That's always my go-to.  I do have to say the next bartender that came on shift was a delight and seemed more on the ball, so the knucklehead that was there earlier gets a one star! \n\nThey do serve gluten free pasta here too.\n\nI think next time, I'll sit at a table!
