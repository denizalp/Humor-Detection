Y'know, for a chain, Vocelli puts forth a perfectly fine pie. Someone ordered one from the Carrick location during our monthly Three Rivers Ferret Council meeting, and I was rightly impressed with its puffy crust, toasted bottom, lusty sauce, oily pepperoni cups, and stringy cheese. Having not had a Vocelli pizza, I was reminded of why they populate Western Pennsylvania as prolifically as they do. \n\nEven their Italian hoagie defeats many submarine peddlers with its baguette-like bread, zesty dressing and ample meats and vegetables. \n\nHey, if left with a choice between Papa John's and Vocelli, I'm leavin' Schnatter hangin'. His riffs are nothin' but a drag, man. \n\nSure, everyone favors the indie pizzerias, but for a company (founded by a Turk no less) with 100 restaurants traversing 9 states, they do their best to make it seem mom-n-pop. \n\nP.S. Vocelli Pizza began in the suburb of Mount Lebanon as Pizza Outlet. WWE and TNA superstar (and 'Burgh native) Kurt Angle appeared in this goofy commercial for the chain back in the late 90's...\n\nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=oCDS2cmcMNA
