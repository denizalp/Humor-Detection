So my second time in LV and i had never been to a buffet. I love food and I tend to not have very good self control so I steer clear from places like that. You know the kid in the candy store expression? Sadly that's me when I see food. Here is an example: I can eat pizza 24\/7 if it is standing in front of me. I can tolerate the pain it gives me. So I was a bit nervous as there was so much potential for my ass to grow. But I figured when in it Rome, screw it and stuff your face, you are on vacation. Well I am ashamed to say that in 4 days, I went to 3 buffets. See? Zero self control. \n\nThis buffet was suggested by trip advisor as top 5 buffets on the strip. It was second following Caesar's and third was the Wynn one. \n\nWe went in and was told that the wait time was going to be bad. It wasn't all that awful. If you are like me and love people watching (and occasionally judging) then there was plenty of things to see and watch while waiting in line. We anticipated 1 hr and we were in within 30 mins. \n\nYou sit down and the servers come and get your drink order. Then u go and pick your food and thats where all your troubles begin. HOLLY CHOICES! There were 5 kinds of salmon, cooked in all sorts of ways. Calamari salads, pasta, pizza, veggies, mussels, shrimp, beef, chicken, ribs, sushi, chinese food, breakfast food, all types of bread, a whole section with fruit and another one with desserts. There wasnt anything that I tried that I didnt like. I went absolutely crazy on seafood and fruit that I couldnt even make it to the pizza section. I was beyond stuffed. Therefore I became the healthiest eater in buffet history. Only fish and fruit. Hey I am ok with that.\nThe only reason I deducted a star was because a few of the foods were cold. Otherwise, that place was every eater's paradise. Props to bellagio for even keeping up with the abundance food and people.
