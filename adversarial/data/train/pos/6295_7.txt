I'm here in Vegas to celebrate a #girlboss in the making. So 15 ladies picked Aria Cafe.. Their menu provided a variety of food to satisfy all the ladies including the picky ones., They're somewhat on top of their customer service. I can see they are overwhelmed by the amount of ppl in the restaurant and the amount of ppl in our group.. \nI thinking Mexican restaurant. I ordered the mojitos. Nope don't offer it and don't even have the ingredients to make it.. Bummer. Food have a good presentation. Overall very good., few ladies complaints about not have enough sides. Like to little mushrooms or missing this and that. I'm happy with my shrimp and crab pasta! Very well done. \nNow this is where it went wrong. We have 15 ladies.. They will not separate the tics., all they can do is take 4 credit cards at most! So we have to figure it out among ourselves. Most of us have to run out to the ATM machines get cash which charge us $6.99 surcharge. We tried to take to the manage but that's policy and will not change that.. so large party beware!
