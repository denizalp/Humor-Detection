I came here around 4pm for their afternoon tea, and this place was soooo empty. That already says something when a hk style cafe is empty during tea time. Which brings me to my next point... The service here is extremely slow. There were only 2 tables seated and the service is still slow. There were waitresses on the floor but they're just on their phone or talking to each other. When you try to get their attention to place an order or whatever, they will avoid your eye contact because they don't want to serve you. Never understood why people are like if they choose to work in the customer service industry lol. \n\nThe food here is not that great either. I ordered deep fried chicken wings with fries, and the batter was just off. My friend ordered soup noodle and it was nothing special. The food here is bland and the menu isn't that great. Peachtree has so many better hk style cafes so don't bother coming here!!!
