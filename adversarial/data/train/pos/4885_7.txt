I headed straight to McKoy's after landing at the airport because after googling \"things to eat in North Carolina\" all the searches came back saying BBQ. I placed an order for the BBQ pork plate to go with the super sweet bartender. McKoy's seems like a cool place to eat and have a drink or two, but all I really wanted was to take a shower, get in my pajamas and eat in bed! (It's allowed at hotels. At home, not so much).  Anyway, despite all the \"research\" I did, I forgot that NC bbq sauce is vinegar based and I promptly choked and coughed up a storm from the tanginess. I started dipping a little more conservatively after that. They also give you a second, more traditional bbq sauce as well. Everything was delicious, including the mac & cheese and coleslaw. I only managed about half the plate before I gave up. \n\nI highly recommend McKoy's and am looking forward to coming back the next time I'm in Charlotte!
