We arrived here after a stroll in Roncesvalles. They seemed at full capacity but the hospitable staff found us a seat promptly. We jumped at the chance to have some Polish beer. I opted for one that seemed easiest to pronounce. \n\nI ordered the Polonez Schnitzel with pierogi. The oversized plate was laden a massive schnitzel topped with fried mushroom and 'salad bouquet' consisting of shredded beets, coleslaw and fried cabbage. The pork was thin, tender and nicely seasoned. The only thing I thought it needed was some sort of sauce or gravy but I suppose it's not typically eaten that way. The cheddar and potato pierogi were soft heavenly treats. The fried cabbage was amazing. It was sort of like Bigos or hunter's stew.    \n\nThis is a great place to get a homey and hearty meal. I would definitely be making frequent trips here if I lived in the neighbourhood. Be mindful of the gigantic portions!
