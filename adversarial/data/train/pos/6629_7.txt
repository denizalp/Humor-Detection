Not a fan of Buddy Valastro as a tv chef personality; however, his restaurant did offer some delicious and memorable appetizers. \n\nPros\n\nMacaroni & Cheese Carbonara: One of the most decadent and rich mac & cheese I've had. Although the pancetta was lacking, the cheese sauce was pure heaven and the penne pasta was cooked just right. \n\nAunt Nina's Mozzarella Corozza: It's pretty much a delicious version of the grilled cheese sandwich filled with plenty of mozzarella and pesto that is placed on a chunky bed of ragu. The only dislike I had about this appetizer was that the sandwich was drench in too much olive oil for grilling. \n\nMargherita Pizza: A simple pie that was baked to perfection with a perfect ratio of mozzarella, tomato, and basil. \n\nOverall great dining experience with delicious food to start off the day. I definitely will return and also will be saving room for dessert to try out his popular bakery, Carlo's Bakery that is located across the restaurant.
