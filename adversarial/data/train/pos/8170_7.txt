Cute place hidden away in a strip mall on University. Love the look and feel, and the ambiance is nice but casual - great patio as well.\nService was awesome - they leave green glass bottles filled with cucumber water at your table. Everyone we interacted with was helpful, accommodating and super friendly.\nAmazing happy hour deals on food and drinks - healthy pours on the wine were appreciated as well. They serve terrific Moscow mules in copper mugs also.\nAcoustic entertainment was phenomenal, not overbearing or loud and really nice to listen too.\nHummus nachos, quinoa fritters, salut burger and stuffed avocado were all tasty. Too much good stuff to try for just one visit. A return trip is needed for sure!
