Third time must be a charm.\n\nA couple weeks ago my husband and I struck out at Hal's Bar & Grill (too long of a wait for a table) and Hop House (smoking inside) before we headed to Sushi Tomo for dinner.  We had a great meal with prompt, friendly service.\n\nOrdered 4 specialty rolls and enjoyed them all.  Good ingredients, and the price and portion were just about right.\n\nIcing on the cake?  To the Entertainment members out there, Tomo rocks a pretty good coupon!\n\nSimple interior.  Nothing special there.\n\nWe'll be back again and again, I promise.
