New Italian restaurant on Monkland?   We're in.\n\nThe place is gorgeous, service is really wonderful.....but the place is so overcrowded.  The lineup to get in was outside the door.    So, we got pizza to take out.\n\nWe chose the ZAZA pizza - 18.00\n(crumbled sausages, mozzarella, red peppers, basil).\nThe pizzas are all thin crust and very small - 12\".\n\nThe sausage was great, the red pepper was bottled, not fresh.    Crust was kind of wet and sloppy, but the taste was ok.    Not great, just ok.\n\nWe also ordered the arancini - 8.00\n(5) breaded tomato and cheese risotto croquettes\n\nMy man (who is old school Italian) asked if it was going to be as good as his mother's arancini.    The server said it was better and we'd be back the next day for it.    We won't be going back for the arancini but it was ok.     We'll stick to his mom's dish  :-)\n\nIf you are lucky enough to get a seat there, you'll like sitting in a VERY trendy pizza place but the food doesn't taste like Nonna's.   It fits in with the Monkland crowd well though.
