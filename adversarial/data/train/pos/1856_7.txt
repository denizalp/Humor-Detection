I can't begin to tell you how wonderful this company is. I bought a mattress from their Sq. Hill store by Homestead and every part of the experience was excellent. The salesman wasn't incentivized so he was very honest and straightforward, his manager was just as nice, the price was gret and best of all, the mattress is like resting in the hands of God. I've literally slept in every day since I bought the mattress (Serenity Memory Foam) about 2 months ago. I had no idea how badly I was sleeping before. I feel refreshed and relaxed every day. Just remember to go to bed earlier because its tough to crawl out o something so comfortable.
