I can count the number of times that I've been to vegas on one hand.  Unfortunately, i don't really drink.. or gamble.. or enjoy vegas in general... (I know~ I'm weird).  But with this last trip to reunite with old college buddies, I experienced the most marvelous steak joint ever.  It was pretty darn epic.  SW outranks any past experience at a steak house I've experienced.  I'd come back to vegas just to eat here.\n\nI hear that SW Steakhouse is a close competition to Del Frisco (which I have not experienced).. but the members of our group who have been to both preferred SW over DF.\n\nWe had reservations for our group of 7 and were seated near to but not next to the great Lake of Dreams (which is both pretty trippy and cool.. gorgeous view tho!)  Started off with a couple of bottles of wine and THE BEST BACON BREAD EVER.  It was hard for the girls not to scarf and fill up on this bread.  The cream butter with two types of fancy smancy sea salt was soo good.  Soft, creamy, and melt in your fattty mouth heaven.  I adore bread.  Both the french and the bacon bread were delicious.  (Take a gander which one was better)..\n\nSome of the members had appetizers.. and the BLT salad came with this FAT solid 1 inch slice of premium bacon.. balancing atop crisp lettuce and heirloom tomatoes.  It was a gorgeous sight.  I can only dream of how big this slab of bacon was before being cooked down.\n\nOur meal was absolutely delicious.  \n\nBF and I split the Porter for two (I did the math and it was cheaper than the individual steaks).  IT WAS DIVINE.  Came out sizzling and hot in a huge plate (it was a shit load of meat for two people~ i think like 40 ozs?  I know~ fat@ss. haha).  We added the fois gras - which was an awesome move cuz it made everything melt in your mouth.  There was a side of.. not leeks.. but similar to celery root .. just can't remember.. but it was all heavenly.\n\nWe got sides to split for the table... and YOU MUST ABSOLUTELY GET THE CREAMED CORN.  I don't normally enjoy creamed veggies but this was ... sex rolled into a winning lotto ticket and a double promotion at work.  Yes.  It was awesome.  The mac and cheese was meh~ not bad but a little bland.. and... I can't remember the other sides but they were all fabulous.  TRUFFLED CREAM CORN. GET IT.\n\nService was great.  Wine and food abundant.  Great friends.\nIt was by far the best experience second to Chippendales.\n\nDefinitely recommend this place and would absolutely return (once I save up enough money haha).  It broke down to about $100 per person which isn't bad considering the quality, alcohol and service.\n\nFABULOUS.\nAdded to the List of Ya Really Gotta.  \nSo GO! :)
