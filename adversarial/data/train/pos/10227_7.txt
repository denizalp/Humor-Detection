When I lived in Charleston, I spent way too many nights at Wet Willie's drinking one flavor after another of the yummy daiquiris.  Alas, I no longer live in Charleston, and can no longer take in quite so many.  Even the samples they generally provide will do just fine, thankyouverymuch.\n\nUnfortunately for this particular location - at least when I have been - is that they seem to be generally somewhat on the empty side.  That is good if you want friendly service, but bad if you want a social environment.  You can only do so much if you are the only person in the place, right?  After all, a few \"Call a Cabs\" or \"Shock Treatments\" are only so much fun by yourself.\n\nStill, it is a nice setting, and it shows promise - it would just be so much better if it were elsewhere, and you could stumble around after you have had that awesome brain freeze and do something interesting, rather than figure out why you are out in the middle of nowhere on the wrong side of the tracks.  Concerts are nice, and a late-night breakfast at Mattie's is good, but your options there are limited.  Location, location, location!
