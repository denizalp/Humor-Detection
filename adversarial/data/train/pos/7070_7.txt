It's definitely not one of the best night clubs on the strip. The decor and lighting was pretty cool but the majority of the time I was stressed out on constantly getting pushed and stepped on by strangers. I paid to watch The Chainsmokers, who didn't even perform until 2 a.m. Personally thought I wasted my money. I felt like I was getting treated like dirt. The people that work there are so arrogant and unhelpful. I was really thirsty and needed some water so I asked for tap water the guy just straight up said no. Then he says they only have Fiji water for $10( it was the small Fiji water too). I thought maybe it was just him being so uptight so I went to a female bartender and she said the same thing so I decided to just ask for ice and she also said no to that. Watch, one day someone is going to die from dehydration from this club and they're going to get in so much trouble. Overall, I would just pay for bottle service, that way they will treat you like royalty.
