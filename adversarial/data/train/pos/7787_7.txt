This LCBO is just right off the 404.\n\nThere is very limited parking, so some people either park further away from LCBO or in the handicap spots to make a quick grab.\n\nThe employees are not friendly - as mentioned - and if you can't find something, they won't stop and ask if you need help, you're stuck finding it yourself.\n\nThis location does offer wine sampling. I've never sampled the wines but that's a definite plus to this LCBO.\n\n3\/5
