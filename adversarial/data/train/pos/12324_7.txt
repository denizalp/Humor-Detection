I had a great time kayaking on the Hoover Dam Launch tour in June. Janet our guide was friendly, patient and efficient. The small paddling crowd varied from old to young and from athletic to medium. The conditions that day were pretty good with some wind in the afternoon which made things more challenging.\n\nBest parts: This is a lovely area of the Colorado River. We saw some wonderful wildlife. Along the 11 mile stretch of river that is the Hoover Dam Launch tour, we stopped several times and hiked into the slot canyons and hot springs. We saw some beautiful caves and crystal clear water, and amazing rock formations everywhere. This is a great getaway and a really well-planned trip. It's also a good taster for destinations you might want to seek out on  your own next time for camping or soaking in that area. Most parts she showed us have road access although you may have to hike a lot more than we did to get to the springs or river.\n\nWorst parts: None really except maybe really decide if the Hoover Dam Launch tour is for all levels including beginner. If you have kayaked very little and aren't super active, think about a shorter trip so you get the ultimate enjoyment out of things. At the end of our 11 mile paddle I was pooped in the rear so had no warning there was a strong current to avoid right before our landing area and found out the hard way. \n\nBut overall it was a great experience and I felt like I was in really good hands, and I'd recommend it if you want to get out of Vegas and have some nice experiences checking out the scenery and being active.
