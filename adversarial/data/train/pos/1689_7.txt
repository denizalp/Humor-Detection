YELP 365 CHALLENGE 2014-(339\/365) \"Short Stack Of Awesomeness!\"\n\nWe made our way back to the friendliest diner around since I haven't had a plate of Awesomeness(AKA their Sweet Cream Pancakes) in a while. We were fortunate to have Veronika wait on us again which is always great because just her interaction with customers whether they are regulars or first time customers is some of the best service you'll ever have. Seriously.\n\nWe both split  a Breakfast Sandwich Special which came with spuds(their potato chips which you can request soggy or crispy) and a two pancake special(Your choice of Buttermilk or Sweet Cream) which also came with two eggs and either a sausage patty or two strips of bacon. At this point, I couldn't decide between sausage or bacon, so  Veronika suggested some Jalapeno Bacon which they also serve in their omelettes and sandwiches and I was sold! Everything was delicious as always, and we were fueled up to start our day.\n\nIt's great to see that this place is constantly packed and that this family owned business is doing well. Another thing I've noticed is that they now have a lunch and dinner menu, and that they are open until later(I believe I saw 7 am-9 pm Monday-Saturday, and Sundays only, 7 am-3 pm) but I wasn't too sure, so you may want to call to confirm.  ALOHA!!!\n\nShaka Meter:  \\uuu\/  \\uuu\/  \\uuu\/  \\uuu\/  \\uuu\/  5
