The Flamingo. What can I say. I thought it would be HELLA old school like Downtown but it wasn't too bad at all. \n\nThe rooms wouldn't cool down as much as I'd like but I had a great view of the strip, got the rooms upgraded with my friends hookups, and it had everything I needed so no major complaints. The price was GREAT so I may just have to stay there again. LOL :)\n\nI'm not a gambler but I started gambling a bit with my friends and drinking. I drank a bit tooooooooooooooo much and ended up losing most of my money!!!!!!!!! Well I guess the drinks helped or something because after the club I played some dinky slots AND????? I won my money back plus a bit more! Yay!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! \n\nSpent pennies on the room, won my money back, and it was conveniently located to a lot of the things everyone wanted to do so.... FOUR STARS! Who thought I'd give the Flamingo four stars right?\n\n:D
