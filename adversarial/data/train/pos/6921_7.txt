I have been here 5 times in the last two weeks (and ordered 30 wings each time)which is dumb of me after the first time, but I will not be coming back again they have failed to get my order correct one again they evidently do not know what sloppy wings are. The customer service is also horrible I stood there for about 5 minutes before being acknowledged and another 5 before the incompetent staff came to assist me. They have lost a valued customer I will either travel across the street or the extra couple miles to El mirage when we need a hot wing fix.
