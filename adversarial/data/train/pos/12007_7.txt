I was taken to Guido's the other day after a business meeting.  The people I went with knew I don't eat meat, but they just didn't care. Screw the vegetarian- she can just have french fries.  And french fries I had, along with a Dr. Pepper.  I felt like I was back in high school. \n\nI can't attest to their hot dogs, but their fries are damn good.  Especially the curly kind.  Everyone else loved their hot dogs and one of the guys was from Chicago- so apparently he knows his dogs.  He said these are the real deal, so if you've been hankering for a weenie, you now know where you can find one.
