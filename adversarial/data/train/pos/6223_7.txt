Originally was supposed to go to the Hash House, but there must have been a line at least 90-minutes long!  Downstairs, Guy Fieri's restaurant was an obvious second choice, especially with the wait being less than 30-minutes.\n\nSaw their HUGE Bloody Mary's on the Food Network Channel and decided to try the smaller version.  This drink was nice and spicy and came with jalapenos, spicy sausage, candied marble bacon and a celery stalk.  You can taste the Vodka, and since my drink came out late, it was FREE.\n\nOrdered the Mayor of Flavortown burger.  The burger patty was cooked nice and was blanketed with seasoned pastrami, which I thought was overcooked.  Swiss cheese, coleslaw, dill pickles, onion straws, and Dijon mustard accompanied all of this sitting on top of a pretzel bun.\n\nThe bun was a little on the hard side, so I ate it \"protein style\" (w\/o the bun).  The fries that accompanied the burger were good.\n\nAll in all, the food was okay.  It didn't suck, but didn't match up to BurGR.  This restaurant is located in the LINQ Hotel.\n\nEnjoy.
