Maybe the maids are superb, who knows ! But the office is a circus, Called to schedule an appointment Aug 18, they took all my info, address and credit card to secure the date and time, I said not to use the card that I was paying cash at the house , they said fine. We scheduled the 21st 9am,  I get a voicemail on the 19th from them saying I understand you would like to set up an appointment, call us back so we can get your address and CC info. Really ? We just did that. I called back, I get something that sound like an answering service, they have no clue what I am talking about, she says let me look at the notes.. oh there was an issue with the card that's why they called you, oh the card you where not supposed to run ? and the card you don't even have because you just called me to say you needed my info ? Wait sir let me transfer you to the office... woman comes on... can't pull up my info .. she says you never made an appointment !! Great thanks GOODBYE ! unreal\n\nReply to Owner Comment... \nThe fact that you would come on here and outright LIE about what happened instead of just apologizing and saying you will train your staff better and do better in the future, shows your mentality, and is the reason why this happens. The call was not disconnected that is a blatant lie by you or your staff telling you that. We had a full conversation, They took all my info, and gave me a date and time and ended the call normally. Your own employee told me on the 2nd call that there where records and that they had an issue with the credit card. So nice try but no.\n\nReply to 2nd comment:\n\nThe fact that you said \"the CALL\" was disconnected is in FACT a false statement ! You can blame the Virtual assistant if you like, maybe they gave you bad information, But these are the facts. The call was not disconnected. \n\nAnd it is not necessary to call me and tell me your an Attorney because I could really care less !\n\nThanks and Don't call me anymore
