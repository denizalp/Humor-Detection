Bad extremely SLOW service and expensive as hell. Came in on a Tuesday night for 1$ oyster happy hour. Oysters were small but good. The oysters came with 3 sauces (I think horseradish, cocktail, and Tabasco) but unsure what they were bc the guy who served us was quieter than a mouse. We ordered two glasses of wine and it literally took TWENTY MINUTES! Everything was too expensive and they only had like 7 items and steak on the menu. Everything was over $30 for an entree. I had to settle for avocado toast, Mac and cheese, and Brussels sprouts. \n\nThey all tasted good but I was definitely ripped off. Why charge so much for food that wouldn't even be categorized as fine dining?!\n\nI also ordered a earl grey mixed cocktail and it sucked. No alcohol and all juice\/tea. Worst service I've ever endured in a pricy\/\"upscale\" restaurant. It was empty tonight so that pretty much speaks for itself.
