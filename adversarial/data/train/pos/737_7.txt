Asked for an inquiry about my car, the owner asked for 60 dollars to even talk to me about anything related to my car. I then asked how much a manual transmission oil change was, they asked for 129.99 when dealership charges 110 dollars. I shook my head and walked away. As I was walking away the owner runs out and screams 20 dollars in a heavy Indian accent. Assuming it was 20 dollars to \"inspect\" my car, other mechanics do that kind of service for free. I do not recommend this place ever. Owners seem extremely desperate for money, I would consider this shop extremely risky to leave your car at. If you are someone who truly cares about your car avoid this shop as much as you can.
