I'm a platinum member for Caesars properties and I spend most of my local time downtown at the horse shoe Cleveland. I paid a first visit to thistle down and it started off terribly! The valet attendant was so rude that I went inside and asked for a manager. The manager came out and was even more rude! I have a large line of credit at both properties and I can tell you I will NEVER go back to Thistledown.
