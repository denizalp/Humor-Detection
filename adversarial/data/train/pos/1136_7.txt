My dog, Riley, is a total disaster of a dog. She's so pretty, but there's not much there in the way of smarts. But we love her!\n\nSo when she was bitten by a rattlesnake, I of course raced her here for treatment. The staff are extremely knowledgable, smart, friendly and forthcoming with information. They told me upfront that this was going to be expensive and all the different options. No beating around the bush, nothing vague or general, just to the point. It was great, totally got the hard part out of the way. \n\nShe was treated with kindness by people who obviously love animals. Yes, it was expensive, about $1700, but obviously completely worth it. \n\nSo remember when I said Riley isn't the smartest? Yeah, well two days after the rattler incident, she ate a bottle of midol. I again found myself back in the clinic. Most of the staff remembered her and treated me and her with the utmost in professionalism and concern. \n\nThat was another $650. (I love my dog.. i love my dog...I love my dog .. I keep reminding myself...).\n\nOy. Well anyway. I would reccommend this clinic to anyone with a pet in distress.
