Food was really good!  The salad was just bagged, iceberg lettuce but fresh.  The different pestos the put on the sandwiches were a nice twist and super fresh tasting.  Place looks the same as the Blue Moose, basically.  Not much you can to do the rear end of an old Medic drugstore.  They have a pretty kick ass LOCAL beer selection and the beer lines tasted pretty fresh. Beers were priced great too!  Same beers they have at many Ohio City and Tremont bars but with less of the Yuppie attitude.  The only problem is the service.   5 of us stood outside for almost 5 minutes while patio servers walked right past us and played on their phones behind the bar, oblivious of customers standing 20 feet away.  Once inside it was basically the same thing.  The manager dude was actually the most professional and efficient of the whole lot.  Took almost 20 minutes for 2 peeps in our party to get their first beer due to \"the keg being out\".  I can change 15 kegs in that time.  The whole time we had to keep flagging down the server while she leaned and chatted behind the bar.  It gets old after a while.  Towards the end, we had a new server altogether.  In this day and age it still astounds me that bars still do the ole Patrick Swayze Roadhouse tactic and have chicks with their juggs hanging out serving people, regardless of if they can wait on people or care to make money.  Dont get me wrong...I like juggs like the rest of em but when 4 people are sitting for 10 minutes with empty beer glasses and shes leaning 10 feet away, we have a problem.  Who cares if they are male, female or what they look like...just get someone who wants to serve customers.  I hope this place reads the reviews and sees that service IS really holding them back.  If not, they might just fade into oblivion like so many have done before in this location.
