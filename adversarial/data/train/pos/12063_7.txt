Sent an email asking about selling books to them because mine didn't fall into the categories of what they weren't asking for, anyway, I was told by \"John S\" what I had was not for them and amounted to the worth of a cup of coffee and that I'd be better off donating to a church! Lol while I found this entertaining, I must say that I would not recommend supporting a store whose staff behaves that way. --- update to review, after I posted this the shop emailed me again and called me creepy, vindictive, hostile, etc! And that they feel sorry for me and I have issues. Wow!
