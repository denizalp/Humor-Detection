I was in Phoenix for a business trip and I wanted to see how the BBQ was like there. This is the best BBQ I've had after Franklin's in Austin Texas. I asked the owners if they knew about Franklin's and the people who owned Little Miss BBQ are from Austin too!!! The line was only 20 minutes compared to Franklin's 5 hour wait. The fatty brisket is to die for!!! We ordered 5 pounds and took it with us when we drove to the Grand Canyon! Honestly after 2 days the food still taste so good!! Ordering extra food was the smartest idea because at the Grand Canyon their best restaurant was Wendy's.... what a joke.\n\nIF YOU WANT GOOD BBQ YOU MUST GO HERE. DO NOT GO ANYWHERE ELSE!!
