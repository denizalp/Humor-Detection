I'm not gonna lie, this was pretty amazing Mexican food. Thank you Yelp. We would have never ever ever have found this place otherwise. They are located in a neighborhood and as of the time we paid a visit, they did not have a sign. It is a brick building that probably used to be a house, and we had to drive past it a couple times to realize we were there. They have a very simple menu, but I am not surprised they have found success with their amazing quality. We shared a enchilada style green chili burrito with beans on the side. WOW. It had cubed pork in it, but I was in love before I even hit any meat. The flavors are so delicious and all of the sauces together were perfect. The beans were super yummy and tasted very fresh and flavorful. We ordered a shredded beef taco that was a special for the day just in case the burrito wasn't going to be enough for the both of us, but it ended up just stuffing us until we couldn't breath. That taco was really good too! It seemed like they freshly fried the taco shell and they were very generous with the beef! Next time we will definitely be satisfied with just the enchilada style burrito to share since it was mighty large. Can't wait to come back for more!!
