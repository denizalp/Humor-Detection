Hot damn.\n\nCan we just talk about how glad I am that Heritage started doing brunch?\nI've only had the Maple Lamb Sausage and Savory Toast but I can't deny that the fried poached eggs were everything I wanted that morning. The sausage, eggs, and bread to mop up those runny yolks was exactly what I needed. AKA fancy hangover food.\n\nBeing the glutton that I am...not only have I indulged in Brunch, but the Late Night Menu is the bomb dot com as well. I used to come here for late night snacks and cocktails ALL THE TIME and let me just say to the bar staff, you guys rock my socks off. I have never had a bad night sitting up at the bar sipping on an Angostura Sour and noshing on the Tempura Spicy Tuna Roll with some friends.\n\nThat roll calls to me. I have to say that thoughts of that roll, with its crispy pork belly, and fresh citrus layered on top of a tempura fried tuna roll has DEFINITELY been the cause of many of my late night voyages to Heritage.\n\nThe menu is really rich and unctious. I would most definitely recommend Heritage to those seeking out a delicious and possibly coma inducing meal.
