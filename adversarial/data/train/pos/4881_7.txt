Rina is the sweetest! I was referred to her by a friend at my gym, and I've been very pleased with her work so far. As a devoted Cherry Lash Lounge customer for years, I'd started to become a bit disillusioned with their prices and the fact that my extensions were barely lasting 2 weeks. \n\nAlthough the shop where Rina works isn't fancy or plush, it's comfortable enough. She'll play whatever music you like while you're on the table, and she even has a blanket so you can nap while she works on your lashes. She discusses what look and length you'd like before she starts to make sure you're satisfied. \n\nMy lashes always look great when she's finished, and she works quickly and efficiently. Her prices are very reasonable, and she accepts cash or credit cards. You can even schedule your appointments via text with her and she'll send you a confirmation reminder the day before.\n\nAlthough my lashes (especially one eye) starts looking like they're riding the struggle bus by the third week, I attribute that mostly to a combination of the way I sleep and the amount I exercise.\n\nIf you are looking for an affordable set of lashes by a great artist, I highly recommend Rina!
