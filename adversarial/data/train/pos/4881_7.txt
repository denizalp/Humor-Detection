I don't really like using words like \"breathtaking\" and \"serene\" and \"dewy morning breeze\" so I'll just summarize my feelings with an Englyn unodl:\n\nHaven of games and play thou Bickford Park!\nStone's throw from LinuxCaffe,\nDogs in thy fallen leaves play,\nWith ease thou showeth the way.  \n\nThere's not much else to say. Feel free to scatter my ashes here (when I'm dead).\n\nObligatory Title Pun: BICK of the litter.\n\nMenu Readability: Just the breeze, yo.\n\nNeed to mention: This park is probably a mad wicked place to toboggan come winter.\n\nWhat this place teaches me about myself: Is there anything Welsh shortform poetry can't do?
