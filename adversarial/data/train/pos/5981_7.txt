When we stumbled into Dick's we did not know that it is their intent to be rude and insulting.  I caught on pretty quick as I looked around and read the hats of fellow patrons some of which said:\n\n\"daddy says I'm more flexible than mommy\"\n\" I swallow on the first date\"  \n\"moses popped my cherry\"\n\nWe caught on quick when a rude ass server came up and said \"i'm hungover\"  and thru down a bunch of napkins and silverware on our table.\n\nI said \"perfect, so are we!\"\n\nWe all got along just fine!\n\nthe servers point uninterested at the menus on the wall and drag their feet while they move from table to table. \n\nWe had a great time listening to the heavy guy on the mic insult folks and do lap dances.  And yes - my daughter got one.\n\nI could not resist when he said \"anyone having a birthday???\"  I pointed to my girl.  She shook her head back and forth like she was possessed but I didnt care - i kept on hollering!\n\nThe lap dance is a funny mockery of a very not cute guy in a very small red thong that is pulled out high on his waist so you can see it when he removes his shirt (all while dancing) to expose a big old belly.\n\nIt was comedic to those of us that did not have big man ass in our faces.  Keep in mind my daughter is probaby 5'7\" and maybe weighs 115 pounds and here is this big ass dude bumping and grinding in her face.  \n\nShe was a good sport in the end and laughed with us as we watched the video.\n\nHer best friend got a hat that read \"easier to get into than a community college\" \n\nThe food was actually pretty good for dive grill food and the drinks could use more booze in them but does not matter - we had a blast and left stuffed.\n\nIt turns into a nightclub of sorts in the evening - we skipped that part of it.
