Must write review before coma sets in...\n\nOk belt removed, Fat pants on and a hunger of an angry bear! I thought I was ready for the feat that was presented before me...\n\nMet some great local Yelp friends for a burgerfest at Holy Chuck and Holy F@#% What options they have here! I would try to list them all but you should just go to the website and look at the menu for yourself, or better yet go down to Hwy 7, HUNGRY!\n\nI ordered The Grazer Burger: Panko crusted portobello mushroom stuffed with feta and cream cheese, deep fried and topped with lettuce, tomato and lemon herb aioli between two grilled cheese sandwiches! Wow that was a mouth full. The only thing missing was the meat but I wanted to try something totally not normal of any kind of burger I have tried in the past. It was pretty good but next time I'll go for the hearty cow! But I loved the grilled cheese! Yum!\n\nI was going to get a shake but when I heard about what our group was going to share I had to fall back a little and get a water so I could have room for the rest. Next time tho! Banana Split or Bacon, Fudge and Sea Salt Shake, or the Strawberry cheesecake shake sounds amazing!\n\nOur group shared a variety of the gourmet fries: \n- Traditional Poutine with real Qubec cheese curds\n- Creamy Feta Fries\n- Holy Chuck Fries (Bacon, double cheese, smothered in chili)\n- Raging Bull Fries (Double bacon, Double Cheese and fresh sauteed hot banana        peppers with raging bull gravy) SPICY! \n- Fresh Black Truffle Fries (Aged Village Cheese from Northern Greece, French Truffle Oil, and shaved fresh black truffles from Italy. Served with Truffle Oil Mayo) Gourmet!!\n\nNow remember there was about 11 ppl sharing these, but we still barely made a dent! \n\nI remember now sighing from the feeling of being full now starting to settle in. So I mentally opened my dessert stomach and prepared for round Sweetness!\n\nFoie Gras Pancakes!! OMG!! The Best Thing I Have Ever Put In My Mouth EVER! AND WE WERE WARNED!\nReady??  8 buttermilk pancakes stacked high, topped with Foie Gras, fresh Italian white truffles, pure maple syrup truffle oil and a wild blueberry compote... Yes it's 34.99 but what do you expect!! It's to die for!!! Oh and some real whipped cream on the side with truffle shavings. \n\nNow you think that's enough, we also were able to indulge in the next tastebud bursting funnel cake, topped with vanilla ice cream, strawberries and warm nutella sauce! \nBy now the table around me became distant, the voices became muffled and I could just hear the beating of my heart start pounding away to work at digesting this glorious \"last supper\". \n\nI think all in all, the experience from start to finish was amazing, just go! But make sure you have someone to roll you out to your car after you are done.
