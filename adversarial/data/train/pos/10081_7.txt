I've been to this TFK more times than I can count, so I can't believe I haven't reviewed it until now.  (I have reviewed the Biltmore location).\n\nI've been here alone, in small groups of 2-4, in larger groups of 5+, with and without my toddler.  I've never had a bad experience.  That says a lot.  The food is consistent, healthy, and delicious.  The service is attentive.  The atmosphere is lively.  The bathrooms are clean.\n\nThis has become a go-to place for us to meet friends that live in North Scottsdale as it's kind of half-way...\n\nStandout items on the brunch menu in my opinion are the johnnycakes and the open faced egg white omelette.  I enjoy the \"bright eyes\" drink as well.  For lunch\/dinner, you really can't go wrong but some of my faves are the vegetable crudite appetizer, the kale salad with salmon, the pan seared sea bass, teriyaki brown rice bowl.  You can't go wrong with their turkey burger either, and their pizzas are great for kids!\n\nOn the FRC website, they say that \"At True Food Kitchen, we want you to feel better, live longer, and make your mouth happy in the process.\"  I'd say they are making good on their mission - one meal at a time!\n\n****It's worth noting that the parking situation at Scottsdale Quarter is either in the big lot or valet unless you have really good parkma and score a spot on the street nearby.
