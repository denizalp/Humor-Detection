Saturday morning after a long and enduring night of partying, they wanted some filipino breakfast.\n\nIt was around 11, and we assumed that they would have a full arsenal of breakfast food since, well, vegas doesn't wake up until then anyway.\n\nThey had the lunch items out, absent any common breakfast items like fried eggs, garlic rice etc. They did have langonisa and tocino though. \n\nWe got a combo which had lechon kawali, (yeah for breakfast, I know) and langonisa, and regular rice. The portioning was small, and for a pricey fee of $8.00 \n\nThe only aspect of the meal I thoroughly enjoyed was the langonisa (am I spelling this correctly), everything else was just ok.
