Maybe I was too excited about Igor riding the all terrain segway last time I reviewed this Pizzaiolo...\n\nTwice since that date I have gone and they have been completely out of beer, so the $9 beer + slice special was unavailable. \n\nThe bad:\n- They are often down to 1 or 2 slice options after 10pm.\n- Sometimes they are out of pizza and stay open (wtf?)\n- They close at 11 during the week. I always want pizza at like 1130 on Tuesdays.\n\nYesterday was the last straw for me. They were out of draught beer, but didn't say anything until after we had already ordered and paid! They offered us bottles of beer but the value proposition was extremely sketchy. Slices are $4.19 individually so having a shitty bottle of beer with it makes it like $5.80 additional for a drink. Why didn't they say something before we cashed out? Donkeys.\n\nGoman ordered a Moosehead and I ordered a Corona and she gave him a Stella (not advertised as available), but then didn't have another one for me so I had to stick with my shitty Corona and he got a good beer (good being subjective considering we were at a Pizzaiolo).\n\nThe pizza is still really good and it's still really close to Gomans but the beer situation is unacceptable and also happens ALL THE TIME.
