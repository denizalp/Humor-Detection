I absolutely love this mall, even though the parking makes me want to shoot myself in the throat. People don't know how to read stop signs, they shoot out of their parking spaces without a second look, and they will run over pedestrians. \n\nLet's start with the good stuff!\nHowever, I love coming here for cheap electronics or other stuff that will be way overpriced anywhere else. The one thing I don't like is how the stores are so repetitive- if you're not familiar with this place, you can easily get lost because it all looks the same. Here's a tip though, if you're planning to meet someone here, at all the 'intersections', up on the wall, there's a 'street name\/#' so it can make it easier. \nHere's some of the notable stores in pmall:\nG nail - relatively cheap (compared to other places) and pretty nice nail designs! The workers\/managers are all very nice and helpful.\nPhoenix - if you're looking for nyx cosmetics or cheap nail design supplies, this is your place, girl! They have OPI, NYX, China glaze polishes for cheaper than other places.\nPhat buddha - I have a review on this so if you want more info on it, go look at that. But great artists\/designed tattoos for a decent price!\nLucky Jewelry - if you're looking for AAA quality replica bags, this is your place. I took my real LV neverfull into here and the one Cici sells was almost exact. And I'm expert at telling LV replicas apart. All the other ones from the random stores are just dingy and bad quality or ok quality but jacked up prices. The prices match the quality pretty well even though I'm not a fan of the replica industry.\nReal fruit - best bubble tea in the mall (thats right, including chatime), they usually have fresh mango deals (buy 2 get them for $2.49 each\/buy 1 get 1 free). Don't pass it up!! The fresh mango is amazeballs. \nSolestop - this place sells your typical 'swag' clothes, obey\/diamond\/hundreds\/vans etc. It's slightly discounted (due to sales), but they're legit.\nThe candy stores - they sell japanese\/korean\/chinese candy\/snacks and they're soooo good! Hard to find it anywhere else.\n\nThe bad stuff..\nYou can't walk into a store without being bombarded by sales people thirsting for your attention. Even if you don't walk in, they'll still call out to you from inside the store. \n90% of these stores charge a 15% tax rate if you pay with your debit\/credit card- if you shop here, be ready with cash.\nAlso, the security guards that work here.... not sure if they've never had female interaction in their life, but they definitely do not hide the fact they check out every female walking past. Ugh.\nPLUS! AVOID AT ALL COSTS ON WEEKENDS\/HOLIDAYS!!!! Unless you want to be bombarded by herd off the motherland, oh gosh. \nAnother thing, if you're not obviously from an asian descent, many workers will not be helpful to you here and may talk shit about you while you're in the store. I've witnessed many of these interactions before. They may also try to scam you for a higher price than what others pay.
