Had a great time at the CMYE last month at Popcorn Girl in Las Vegas, and 12 hours later I found myself in Chicago at a Garrett Popcorn Shop! Popcorn Girl has an incredible variety of flavors, and really good quality corn. I even took a picture of the Garrett popcorn and Popcorn Girl popcorn side-by-side on the same blue plate (see photos) to show how identical the kernels are. If I had to guess, they get their corn from the same farm\/distributor! \n\nIt was fun trying the different kinds of Popcorn Girl flavors and the tastes got more interesting as different flavors were eaten in sequence with others. One sweet kernel, one salty, one hot, another sweet one, etc. It was HARD deciding on which bags to get, I ended up choosing a caramel bag and a smoky BBQ bag. I chose smoky BBQ because I liked the sample - it was one of their special flavors of the week.\n\nGarrett Popcorn in Chicago has been the benchmark for caramel and cheese flavored popcorn since I was 5 yrs old. (I grew up in Michigan). When the opportunity came to taste Popcorn Giri caramel side-by-side with Garrett's CaramelCrisp I got excited.\n\nAnd the winner is...\nWith the kernels virtually identical in size, texture and shape (see photo) it really came down to preference of the caramel coating. The Popcorn Girl caramel coating is sweeter and more candy-like, and the Garrett caramel coating is more buttery and toffee-like. Popcorn Girl's caramel corn seemed to stick to my teeth a smidge more than Garrett's. Garrett's had that \"this can't be good for you\" aftertaste, conjuring visions of Chris Farley on 90s SNL pounding his sausage-eating chest during the Chicago Bears sketches. SO, if I had to declare a winner I would hand it to Popcorn Girl - to pull off popcorn this good 2000 miles away from the motherland of corn, she's doing a lot right! Way to go! See you again soon!
