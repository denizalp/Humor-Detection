Ohhh my goodness, I know that I live here and I KNOW that this is a crazy time in AZ, but I had no idea how crazy Old Town Scottsdale would be at 6 PM (I thought it was a late night scene, no?) Uhg, I must be getting old! I told my friends from out of town to meet us here to watch March Madness and it was CRAZYYY! If I didn't have a headache, I would have probably been way more into it! ;) \n\nWe ended up sitting at the bar after waiting for a little while, not totally ideal but we were hungry! Apparently they DO reserve tables (regardless of the size), which is great to know when coming to watch future sporting events here! \n\nOk, onto the food. It is definitely your typical 'bar food' type of place. I ordered the house salad with grilled chicken + ranch & buffalo sauce. For $7 (before you add the chicken), it was REALLY small! I definitely thought it would be bigger than a side salad due to the price, but nope. They also forgot the cheese and croutons, but i'll give them the benefit of the doubt since they were busy! The beer was ice cold and the bartender was VERY friendly! I'm assuming we'll be back since it is in the heart of Scottsdale and a great place to watch sports!
