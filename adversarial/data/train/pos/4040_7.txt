Pat's is pretty damn good. Good pizza, GREAT wings. \n\nI really don't like going in there. \nA previous poster mentioned the love\/hate relationship Pat's seems to have with it's customers. Passive-aggressive signs are literally everywhere you turn. No bills larger than $20. If you didn't buy it here don't eat it here. Please close the door behind you. Don't steal the magazines. Even on the website and all capped and pissed off;  Please HAVE YOUR ORDER READY ordering delivery. Please have your credit card number READY. Last deliveries of the night are CASH ONLY!!\nOkay I get it, pizza nazi. \nIt's very off-putting.\nHave a little faith in your customers, we're not all assholes.
