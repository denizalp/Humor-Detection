Peter's my boy, your food.. she is not good.  The burgers are not good, the fries are not good, I think your onion rings MIGHT be ok?  I just don't get the hype.  This food is guilty pleasure food, because you feel guilty about going here over Boogies.\nHere is why Peter's gets 2 stars and not 1:  The milkshakes and ice creams are unreal.  Their chocolate dipped cone?  Ugh, lady wood.  The Oreo milkshake? Delish.  Sundaes, banana splits, yes yes all delicious.  \nI also found out why there's always a line up - because it's SLOWWWWWWW.  Have you ever actually gone to Peter's and lined up outside?  You're there forever!  Half the time you forgot what you even ordered.  \nAll in all, if you're looking for a delicious burger:  Naina's, Boogies, McDonald's.  Anywhere but here.\nIn the words of the late Greg Giraldo to Larry the Cable Guy at his roast \"How the f*@K are you SO POPUULLLARRR?????\"
