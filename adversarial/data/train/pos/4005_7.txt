If you have a long, thick, curly, unruly mop like I do, you know the feeling of horror and dread I get when some stylist with perfectly stick-straight hair tells you she knows how to properly LAYER curls. Liar!! Fucking liar!! I have left salons in tears with a mushroom head all my life. I know you know what I'm talking about, curly girls. Not this time!! I happen to be an acquaintance of the salon owner, Davyo, through the local Vegas music scene. Davyo himself is in possession of a head of fluffy, cotton candy, curly-headed goodness. So after chatting a couple of times, I made an appointment with him for my mother (who has been searching for the perfect shag for as long as I can remember) and I. Hallelujah, praise the hair gods!! Not only did my mom get that shag she's always wanted, but I, yes I of the Medusa hair, got an awesome rock and roll head full of layers that not only looks good when left curly (Gasp! I know, can you believe?!), but looks pretty fucking epic after some product and a flat iron. I bow down to you, Davyo. I'm forever your girl.\nP.S. 4 stars instead of 5 only because the next stylist over was really fucking obnoxious. Maybe she was just having a bad day, but seriously, there's a fine line between \"punk rock\" and miserable bitch. She crossed it. It wasn't cute.
