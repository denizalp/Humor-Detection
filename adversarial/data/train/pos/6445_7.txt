Not sure if this place is 2-3-4 or 5 stars. I went here for dinner but they don't serve food. In regards to bars, yeah sure. It's a bar. Seems like a cool biker bar. Classic rock plays and motorcycle shit is everywhere.\n\nActually there is a fucking deer hanging from the ceiling. No joke a fucking a deer
