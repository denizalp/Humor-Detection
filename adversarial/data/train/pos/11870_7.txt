Trader Joe's to the rescue! https:\/\/youtu.be\/q3-SzNSLn0M\n\nIt was a scorching hot day with no store in site where I could drop $10 on a freshly extracted 12-16 ounce cup of fruit\/vegetable juice. But no fear, TJ's came through. \n\nI really needed a 100% juice thirst quencher, and even though I have never bought juice from TJ's -- usually I'm shopping for nuts and snacks -- I figured there had to be coconut water stocked on the shelves. Every store and it's flagship is selling coco H2O these days.\n\nFrom the inventory, I chose the small store brand of King Coconut Water because it had no added ingredients. Also, from the refrigerated juices, I selected a store brand bottle of Very Green smoothie.\n\nWell, the coco water was flat and left me feeling stale but I'm pretty sure the bushes in front of the store loved it.\n\nThe smoothie, on the other hand, was very green very good and hit the spot very fast. The spirulina and chlorella molecules knew exactly where to go. I was satisfied and wanted another.
