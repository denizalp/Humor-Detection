Every time I eat Indian food I ask myself why don't I eat this every day?  I love the flavour and it is so satisfying.  Then after I overeat it, I ask myself, how do people eat this everyday?\n\nIndia's Taste really delivers if you are looking to scratch that spicy itch.  For a buffet, the food is fresh, the service is attentive , and the place is clean.  You will find a good variety of vegetarian and meat dishes plus there is a good salad section.  The naan is served fresh as you ask for it.  \n\nMy only thing is the desserts.  They are soooo sweet.  I am not into sweets, and the dessert section here is crazy sweet.  But their carrot dessert is amazing if you can handle the sweet.
