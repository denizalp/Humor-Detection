My appointment here had to be the worst I have ever had for anything. They rushed me through my appointment and felt like I was being flipped around in a frying pan during my mole check. I asked Dr. Bikowski what sort of skin care products I should use for my skin type and he told me that he could only give me information on the products he sold. Keep in mind that he sells expensive products and he knew that I wasn't going to buy any of them. ! I found him to be unethical and really wish I would have reported him to a Medical Board and my insurance company. This visit occurred a couple years ago so I am sure it's too late for that now.
