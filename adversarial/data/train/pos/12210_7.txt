My husband and I went here because my husband had heard from a few friends that it was fantastic. Our meal did not at all reflect that reputation.\n\nWhile we did enjoy the ambience and service, the food was disappointing. Though it was clearly well cooked, it was bland. From the bread to the entree (roast chicken) to dessert (apple pie), everything suffered from a severe lack of flavor.\n\nThis would be a great restaurant to take your mother to, especially if your mother is as deathly afraid of spices as mine is. \n\nI would go back just to have a drink at the bar, but definitely not for dinner or dessert.
