Being able to make \"put a bird on it!\"-related jokes is probably the only  reason I didn't give this place 1 star. I was in Pittsburgh for an extended weekend, and having already had some great food on the Square, thought to hit this place up. Let's start with the food and drinks: coffee was mediocre at best, and although they told me my Americano had four shots, it certainly didn't taste like it. Food? Dismal. I had a Cuban that should be emargoed, and the price was Bay of Pigs-level ridiculous. \n\nBut here's the kicker! You can serve crap coffee, barely edible food, and STILL be a decent cafe as LONG AS your staff is moderately friendly. But not so at Bluebird! I was not thanked for my purchase, I was questioned when I asked for the WiFi password to be written down for me, and was neither greeted nor even given a friendly goodbye by the 3 staff that were busy thinking of other creative ways to be rude to their clientele (I can only assume).    I know what you're thinking: they were probably super busy painting birds on things, and just didn't have the time....NOPE! My friend and I were the only ones in the restaurant. \n\nIn conclusion.  Save your hard earned coins for a place that will at least serve you a half-decent cup o'joe.
