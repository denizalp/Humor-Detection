The store itself is fine-- NO complaints. The weird (and stupid) thing occurred when purchasing a book for my niece. We saw the gift wrapping station next to the Children's books on the third floor. We assumed it was self service since there wasn't anyone there to do the wrapping.\n\nDumb thing #1: No tape. How do you wrap anything without tape?\n\nDumb thing #2: If you wrap the gift, how can they bar code scan the item?\n\nDumb thing #3: The cash is downstairs on the main floor. So to actually pay for the book and have it wrapped, you'd have to: Take your item from the third floor down to the first floor, have it scanned and pay for it, then return to the third floor to figure out how to wrap it without tape.\n\nIs anyone else tired and annoyed yet?
