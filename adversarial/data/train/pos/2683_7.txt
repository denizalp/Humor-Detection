Love at first bite. Love at first sight. It's unusual for a meatlovin' carnivoric consumer like me to say these things about a veggie centric restaurant. But it's true. I absolutely loved Fresh. Vegetarian food never dawned on me as satisfying. I typically crave meat after any vegetarian meal I eat. However, I didn't here, oh no, it was filling and tasty enough to make my meat obsession a delicious juicy memory.\n\nI ordered the All Star salad. Visually, it's what I like about a salad. A hippie's kitchen sink, a bit of everything thrown into bowl with, I recommend peanut lime, choice dressing. Insanely good with seeds, nuts, leaves, shoots, quinoa, sweet potatoes and tofu. Eating a garden party had never been so textual and flavorful. Every bite is different, your chopsticks ( super weird utensils included to eat quinoa) simply can't lift everything with each snatch. Eat wisely and spread out your sweet potatoes.\n\nWhile sitting here, I slowly felt healthier. Obviously psychologically more than anything, but I felt good. The atmosphere was unpretentious and not full of handle bar mustaches and sock hats. It was bright, cozy and busy. \n\nFresh made me rethink of vegetarianism. Would I ever switch? Will I convert to a green and fresh diet? My stomach says never, but my mind and heart say, \"Eat here more, you'll thank us later\".
