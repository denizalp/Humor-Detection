Steak n Shake was not a very pleasant experience for me! After being almost deceived by its homely appearance, I quickly noticed the understaffed, too tired employees. In fact, the waitress even said that the \"chef never came in\" and the \"milkshake guy just walked out\" during a busy busy time (post July 4 celebrations).\n\nAll I wanted was to enjoy a nice cheap chili cheese dog with salt and vinegar fries, but it took the waitress 30 minutes to get to us, and another 30 minutes for her to bring us her food.\n\nIn fact,  I'm pretty sure the waitress was cooking our food. My friend ordered a salad - the apple harvest chicken salad - while we were waiting for our food, we heard a nervous exclamation from the kitchen - \"how do you make a salad?\"\n\nAll in all, the food was mediocre. The hot dog seemed like it was frozen and prepackaged. My other friends chicken tenders looked wimpy and reheated. However, apparently the salad was actually pretty good. Not good enough to redeem the wait though. \n\nIf you're going to come here, just go through the drive-thru. Trust me on this one.
