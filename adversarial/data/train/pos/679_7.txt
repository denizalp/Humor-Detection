A free standing Miracle Mile- hell yes! Since the downfall of the locations I grew up with at Park Central, and ChrisTown Malls, the closing of the locations at both Arrowhead and what used to be The Colonade Mall (turned into some kind of strip mall place), I was thinking I would never again get to have a hot pastrami sandwich from a place that has been in my life since I moved to Phoenix at the age of 4 and that had been in my maternal families life since before then.\n\nWe came on a Sunday around noon after we were at the cemetery for the unveiling of my Grandmother's headstone. It was had\/has been an emotional time and going to a place that had an historical place in my memory and in our family seemed somewhat appropriate. The ONLY thing that was missing was the Karsha's rye bread (Karsha's closed) and the rye bread they are using isn't quite as tasty, with the right kind of pull. The pastrami was just like all of my memories. \n\nMM used to be a Jewish Deli and has been Jewish \"Style\" for years and years now. My husband loved his turkeyBLTA and his side knish and everyone else enjoyed what they had. \n\nPrivate parking lot- and perfectly planned thick covered door handle coverings so you don't burn your hands opening the door.\n\nLooking forward to coming back.
