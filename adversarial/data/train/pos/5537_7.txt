I have to say I love the concept and the modo \"if you don't like your drink they will make you another one!\" The guys here really do ami to please  it the drinks a sort of a tease.  I don't not like their drinks but I wasn't crazy about the drinks that I thought were going to be amazing. \n\nFirst time here I order the Rose bud tea and even though it looks so good and so pretty I wasn't a fan. To me I felt like it had a weird fermented taste or kimchi flavor. I know sounds completely crazy but then again that's what I thought. It had honey in it but the flavor was very vague. Then I came back to try another drink and was excited about the sea salt foam. I ordered the Oolong green tea with foam and honey boba. When I got it I was thrilled that it had good tea flavor chilled but the boba itself was not that amazing. It was pretty bland and lacking honey flavor. For the most part the boba was cooked perfectly I just wish it was a little sweeter. The foam was a nice touch but I guess it didn't really impress me much. \n\nI will definitely be back and ask for my drinks to be more sweeter to see if that will make a difference but for now my take on the Brew Tea Bar is that all the drinks their starts of very bland. For now I like them but I'm not crazy about them the service and the bar itself is top notch but that's pretty much it.
