In montreal so had to try this iconic and timeless institution...\n\nIm telling you guys, this place did not dissappointed. The smoked meat here is the best ive ever tasted. \n\nBest brisket ever with the perfect combination of meat and fat. One bite and its pure meat heaven. Nicely stacked and juicy ....worth the visit for sure. \n\nPlace gets packed easily and tables are cramped...one of the servers acts as a bouncer\/front office manager and yells \"how many?\" As you walk in the door. Typical butcher with a white.apron and shirt and belly....lol. \n\nThe place is so rustic...white boards with the menu and serving only beef , turykey or chicken...no table.orderd chicken while i was there..lol. \n\nI did not order anything else..as i didnt wanna compromise the taste and ruin the experience..\n\nA must try for sure for everyone coming to montreal...
