Unhappy.  That will sum it up.  My room (Room 201) was nice enough when I walked in, but upon inspection, I saw it wasn't very clean. For starters, it had not been vacuumed. Sure, there were new linens on the bed, but why were there used sweet and low packets all over the dresser, trash on the floor, and, get this, an empty soap box shoved underneath the bathroom light fixture. \n\nThe hotel is non-smoking, but everyone at the pool was lit up.  A hotel worker did come by to tell them to put their cigarettes out, but once she left they just lit up again. *repeat scenario about six more times*.  I couldn't even enjoy a moment in the hot tub, (which is nice) because some jerk kept throwing trash around it.\n\nThis is my final complaint..... no accountability to police what people are doing around the hotel.  Huge groups of douche bag frat boys and sorority princesses pounding drinks and screaming or laughing at the top of their lungs directly in front of other people's hotel rooms from midnight to 6 a.m.  I have no problem with people having a good time, but at 2 a.m., stay the f*** away from in front of my hotel room, especially if your obnoxious laugh sounds like a hyena being raped.  I wanted to strangle the female that kept me up for an hour and a half with her \"I have no real personality so I make this sound to seem interesting\" laugh.  Luckily my wife called the front desk and filed the complaint.  \n\nMy only pluses for this place.  Once the front desk is called with a complaint, they go and try to stop it (too bad this is a reactionary response), key word being try, since it seems they do not really enforce any of their own rules.  Free soda's and junk food.  Free wifi. Yup, that's about it.
