My co-workers refer to this PB as \"the cafeteria\" because on any given day at lunchtime at least one person from the office will be here.  Why?  It is really the only \"fast\" thing within walking distance.  Oh, and they have cookies.  The men I work with will not order a cookie (I guess it isn't \"manly\") but it is perfectly acceptable if it comes with the sandwich.  \n\nI think the food is OK.  They have French Onion Soup.  The Chicken Caesar is good, although occasionally (like today) it can have waaaayyyy too much dressing.  I have only tried the sandwiches a few times - they are pretty big with freakishly thick bread.  Did I mention the cookies?  They are tasty.\n\nThe layout can present a challenge when it is crowded.  The line to order and pay is an awkward mishmash of people that want dessert items but forgot to grab them at the front of the line, people who can't decide what they want, and people who can't figure out which register to use.  Whomever is in front of me is guaranteed to have an order more complicated than Meg Ryan's in When Harry Met Sally.  Fortunately, the people behind the counter expect and understand all of this and keep things running smoothly.\n\nOverall a decent place to grab a quick lunch, but it is really the cookies that keep me coming back.
