I went here for the 1st time for Happy Hour with some friends from work.  $4 house margaritas are pretty good.  Happy Hour included a Mexican buffet.  Enchiladas, rice, beans, nachos, salsa.  Pretty much dinner...all very good, particularly for a free buffet!\n\nSo, dinner and a couple margaritas: $8.  That works.\n\nOur waitress Shannon was great.  She was super attentive and had a great sense of humor.\n\nThe atmosphere here is interesting without being fancy-schmancy.
