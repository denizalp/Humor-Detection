Let me start by saying, I am in no way a label whore (I prefer not to purchase anything with a logo), nor am I a Marc Jacobs fan. I find his entire brand image pedestrian and contrived to suit the aspirational market (just like Louis Vuitton). \n\nThose who want to buy into the luxury market but don't know where to start, find LV and Marc Jacobs the most identifiable logo. \n So of course the post-Perry Ellis Marc Jacobs is going to make the most of it, pimping out his name in 'affordable' lines (Marc by Marc Jacobs) and linking up with Kanye West (I mean, who hasn't?).\n\nThis store is another example of preying on the poor label whores of society; Silver wallets for $20, obviously not designed by the team, MJ keychains for under $10. How is that even a designer item?\n\nTo top it all the staff is so pretentious, you'd think you had stumbled into Hermes completely drunk.\n\nMcDonald's of luxury? Without a doubt.
