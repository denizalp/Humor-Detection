While walking to my car with my pizza (mushrooms, olives, and onions), I suddenly realized that my clothes were getting wet.   I stopped walking, tipped the pizza box, and saw liquid pouring out of it onto the ground.   I went back into the restaurant, and someone took the pizza back into the kitchen.  After about a minute, a manager-type came out of the kitchen, opened the register, and started counting out some bills.   I thought: \"What a classy place!  Since my clothes might have been ruined and the pizza now must obviously be subpar, he's refunding my money.\"   Wrong.   He was evidently just making change from the register.   Then the person who had taken the box back to the kitchen came out and handed me a boxed pizza with no explanation.   I looked at her questioningly.   She said the liquid was because of the veggies that I had ordered.   In other words, it was my fault.  We've ordered plenty of mushroom-olive-onion pizzas before, from other places and from the old Barro's, but never before have we had any amount of liquid coming out -- let alone a large amount, as in this case.   And now the pizza was in a new, un-warmed box, so it was going to be cold.\n   \nI had forgotten to order the pizza with a thin crust.   When I opened the box at home, I found that the cuts in the thick pizza dough did not go all the way through.   So in addition to having a poor, cold, dry pizza, we now had to struggle with our pizza cutter as well.\n\nMy clothes were machine-washable, but it would have been very bad if I had had a big food-liquid spill all over my car.   \n\nThis experience was a poor one, and I won't be going back there.
