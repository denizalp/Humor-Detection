I spent the morning at the Occupy Toronto rally at St. James Park watching kids shouting things that they had no knowledge of, and talking to some of their representatives about matters to which they were completely uneducated on.\nAfter a day in this type of mess, I could really use some good ol' Capitalism.  Table for one please.\n\nStudio Cafe is a little piece of Heaven for any middle aged to late aged Woman, or ultra feminine Men.  \"It's the Four Seasons\" that all I have to say.  But for those who don't know what the Four Seasons is all about, Studio Cafe is the epitome of the company image.  The décor is pretty much as if all of the housewives of Toronto came together and masterminded the perfect testosterone free zone, with early 19th century English elegance..the Indian waiters make it authentic......\nThey have these spring metallic chairs that feel sooo amazing, but causes the kids to go wild which is contradictory to the ambience.   \n\nTheir Irish toffee is brewed for drunks, it's very Irish let's just say.  Their cheesecakes are divine!  Things just tasted better here, the décor makes me want to give up all ambition and raise a baby...or a garden.  The service is as it should be for a hotel.  I love hotels because everybody knows my name; Sir.\n\nI recommend you to visit here before the Four Seasons move out of this location.  \nMy friend Stephanie joined me just before leaving, she had a big frown at how feminine this place was....but she has friends in schools like OCAD..so who cares what she thinks! \n\n\nYou know, I went to private school with a girl named Ashley whose parents are co-owners of the Four Seasons chain....I still have her number....what would I look like if I were the face of the ultimate house husband?
