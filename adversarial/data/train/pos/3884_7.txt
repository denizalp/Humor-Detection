Really disappointing.  The staff seemed friendly, but owner was on phone yelling about a problem the whole 30 minutes I was there.  The prices are CRAZY high, beads that are .20 to .25 per bead elsewhere are 1.75 each here!  It's a very cramped, dirty little store and impossible to browse as all the beads are in closed trays in shelves.  Suzie Q does a much better job of high end, Beads N Plenty more is waaaay easier to shop and much better priced.  Will not return.
