So I finally gave in to my curiosity about this \"major LA tradition\" and wow, I was so disappointed! Here's the quick rundown... First, its WAAAY on the east side of town, not worth the drive just for the experience, so save your gas money and time. Second, the burger meat itself - maybe .175 mil thick, I mean thin. Where's the beef? Not here! RIDICULOUS. My double burger when taken as a complete unit, tasted of mustard, dill pickle and chili-goo. There is no grilled beef flavor, nothing more than mustard and pickleness. Folks seem to speak highly of the chili fries, so while I've never in my life ordered that particular item from anywhere, I decided to make it a first (along with my first Tommy's visit). THAT is comfort food. It is everything I imagine one would want in a Cheese Fries - salty-crispy-cheesey-thick chili - its like a big thick food blanket. I forced from my mind the thought of, \"how many calories are probably in this danger food?\" ... all for the sake of my fellow Yelpers. Yes, its all for you! ;)\n\nAnyway... bottom line, In-N-Out is where you need to go if you want anything short of a gourmet burger, that tastes like a burger. Animal style, oh yeah. If you need a fast-food-level chili fix, Wienershnitzel is your place. They have a chipotle chile thing now, and to tell you the truth, it is almost identical to Tommy's chili. They probably source it from the same company. My Tommy's experience sat in my gut, uncomfortably so, for about 5 hours. I'm not used to eating such heavy food, an I will tell you that the other folks at Tommy's that evening seemed to have a BMI of over 40. That should tell you a lot.
