Nope, won't go back. I don't know who these people are that are claiming this place has great seafood, it's simply standard fried seafood, some good some bad. The hushpuppies were really good, so was the potato salad and the tartar sauce. The Shrimp cocktail was the weirdest looking swhite, tastelsss shrimp ever. We got some platter that had popcorn shrimp, very iodiny, fried scallops, fried oyster, and deviled crab, with no crab that I can decipher in there. The only seafood item that was good was the flounder and it came in a huge piece. Never again. This place is ok for a cheap, low quality seafood meal.
