Holy Crap! I came here because I needed to get some hair spray, thinking I'd forgotten it at home. When I asked for the travel size, the clerk showed me that I should buy the full size since the travel size was only $0.20 cheaper. (the hell you say?)\n\nA six pack of Daisani was $3.49. Prices were astronomical, and outside the main door it seemed to be 4:20 every moment of the day.  The store was clean, well kept and over all, your typical Walgreens, only.. ON THE STRIP.
