I am a perpetual cell phone klutz, dropping them and dealing with cracked screens constantly. So, when my iPhone 6S fell one too many times recently, it came as no surprise that my screen had had enough and that a repair was in order. This crack was pretty bad, having spider webbed over most of the front of the phone and even exposing some of whatever it is underneath the glass, in places. \n\nThe guys at uBreakiFix (what a silly name) were incredibly helpful! I chose them because they are a Verizon certified repair shop and the work could be done without having to send my phone out or anything. They walked me through the process of filing my insurance claim with Asurion and when all was said and done, I was in and out in about an hour. All it cost me was the $29.99 deductible! Fast and solid work. \n\nSomeday, I will crack my screen again and when that happens, I'll happily return to uBreakiFix for another repair.
