- 1 * because it's a CHAIN... How disappointing. But, I have got to give this place\/corporation high marks for the name. Genuwine and ballsy. And the \"accessories\" they sell advertising their very own Pink Taco are ingenious too. \n\nSo, we just had to have the pink tacos, 3 chix tacos, \"TJ style\" and they were pretty damn tasty. The fact that the bartendress gave us our drinks free wasn't too shabby either... Maybe she saw us reading the \"Lesbian Coming Out Manual\" (last one off the shelf @ the Borders down the Street, see the separate review) and felt sorry for us? It was a joke, really... She's straight. I am not. Go figure.
