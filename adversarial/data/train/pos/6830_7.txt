This is the best strip bar in town.  Not the biggest or best floor plan, but in terms of the ladies, this place wins.  Almost every girl is at least an 8\/10, and a healthy amount of 9's and 10's.\n\nThe beer is pretty expensive, but you get what you pay for.\n\nIf you want $10 lap dances go to Jilly's and get one from a toothless crack hoe.  If you want premium ladies, come here. (That's what she said.)
