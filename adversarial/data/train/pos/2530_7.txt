I was expecting this shop would get rundown over time because of the location but the outside and inside is still just as clean and orderly as when it opened.  This is the only shop of this kind I would go to on the west side.\n\nThe prices are lower than Castle or Fascinations.  Although the Fascinations Superstore on Elliott has a much larger selection, I'm confident you can still find everything you need (or didn't know you need) at Secrets.
