Payard is another extremely overpriced casino bistro that fails to deliver. I don't understand how you can price breakfast at $20 when most breakfast buffets are slightly above that. In any case, if I'm paying for a $20 sandwich, it better be damn good. The classic madame with ham, b√©chamel, Swiss cheese, topped off with a fried egg and a side of salad and a baked tomato was disappointing. The puddle of oil sitting on top of my sunny-side up egg made everything far less appetizing. \n\nMy friends ordered the original brioche French toast and the lobster eggs Benedict on croissant. The French toast was said to be too sweet to enjoy or even finish for that matter. The Benedict on the other hand was quite enjoyable and by far the best breakfast dish. It had generous lobster chunks atop a flakey, buttery croissant with a decadent hollandaise sauce. For $24, it was well worth the price, unlike the other offerings. \n\nIf you're in a hurry, you might want to try the express cafe next door, otherwise, pay a little more for a breakfast buffet elsewhere for a more satisfying meal.
