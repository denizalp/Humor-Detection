What a delight.  Cleveland truly has a gem here with Edwin's.  I'm shocked that this restaurant doesn't have a Michelin star. In fact, it's surprising the city of Cleveland doesn't have a single Michelin starred restaurant.  \n\nI learned a lot during my trip to Cleveland and this restaurant.  I learned that there is some fine French inspired cuisine that employs formerly incarcerated individuals to help them back on their feet.  The story is the owner had two minor charges as a youth and decided to pick his life up and trained in culinary arts in France. He opened this restaurant not only for his craft but to give back to the community and help people get their life back together.  Truly inspiring ! \n\nI also learned that the restaurant, despite its charitable roots proves that it can offer superb service in par with the top restaurants I have been fortunate enough to frequent.  Outstanding!\n\nI also learned that there is such a thing as table side hamburger where they present the cut of meat and grind it table side.  Then sear it with an impressive show.  \n\nThe overall experience was fantastic.  The menu leaves so much to explore. I hope I get a chance to return.
