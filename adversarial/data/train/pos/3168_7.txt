Our visit here was quite interesting. The resort is pretty and huge. I was impressed the the decor and restaurants. However the people who come here for the nightlife and gambling on a Saturday night ... well, that's another story. I am from LA and have seen a lot. The dress code for the women, and I say \"women\" referring to women over 40, is bizarre. Tight mini shorts with a matching halter top and 5\" grass green wedges out in the middle of the desert was beyond my thought process. I just looked and said, \"Oh my! That's not her church outfit.\" What is with the oversize women in tight tight leopard spandex mini-dresses? I had to look away for fear of staring too hard ... my eyes! My eyes!\n\nAnywho, I am sure it's a whole trendy thang there for desert casino nightclubbing attire but where I come from that's just a bad choice in clothing.\n\nAll in all, the casino and resort were nice.
