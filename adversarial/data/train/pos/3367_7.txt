Utter waste of money. Don't  just don't order food from here and I mean it. We do eat from Tandoori Time, Karachi kitchen, Patna Kabab house,  and Shaheen Tikka and Kabab house quite frequently and we know what NORMAL food should  taste like. Every restaurant in this age and time offer three levels of spiciness MILD, MEDIUM,  & HOT; where as, this place offers only one kind. HOT like hell. My husband and I both got sick with sore throat from the spiciness and piles upon piles of visible traces of green chilli which you can't sperate from ur food. Horrible. For ur info, we ordered chicken seekh  kabab,  chicken biryani, and keep a Naan.  Apart from the food being too spicy, they literally had stuffed one tea spoon of ground meat in their naan to charge you $4.50 . Not worth your money. Shaheen Restaurant or Tandoori time don't do that to ur keema naan at least.
