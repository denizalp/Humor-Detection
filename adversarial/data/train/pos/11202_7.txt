Now Now...I know is unfair for me kept referring to Katz's Delicatessen no matter where I have my smoked meat experience...\n\nCaplansky's Delicatessen is not Katz's... But is not bad!!\n\nI love how there is a choice of lean\/medium\/fat for the smoked meat ... nice waiter suggest medium... that's when my Yelp buddy was in the washroom.. for him, he might have order the FAT!!\n\nSmoked Meat Sandwich ($8)\n- The size is great for snack...(yes snack) but great as lunch with one of the soup!\n- The smoked meat itself I found it a little dry... not too juicy..but has a nice smokey flavour.. but did not Wow me...\n\nCabbage Borscht ($3.50)\n- served hot!! like steaming hot!! \n- I found it hearty, and I love cabbage... and it have bit of smoked meat inside...Yes I love it! \n- I was surprised that it is a cup size, it is more a bowl size...(I got to finish off the rest while my yelp buddy busy eating his sandwiches!)\n\nThe service... here was surprisingly good!! Maybe I expect to have lousy services. \n\nThe smoked meat sandwich though did take a long time to arrive... and the place was not even busy....
