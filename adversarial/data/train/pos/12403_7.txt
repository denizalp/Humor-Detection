Thumbs way down on theses shysters. \n\nMy first red flag should have been the absolute chaos of getting an install date.   I don't know how many times I had to call them to find out the status.\n\nI received a drawing during the planning stages from a field rep that clearly showed the alignment of the roof post on the house wall.   When they came to install it, I made the mistake of letting them get started and I went off to run an errand.   When I got back I found the installers had \"made a decision\" to put the post simply on the roof plywood (not even on a beam).  I get this was due to the designer not knowing the geometry of what he designed, but why didn't they stop and say, \"this isn't right\".     So I made the installers stop.   The office wasn't open on Saturday, but the installer called the designer who said he would come out on Monday and look.   Monday came and went and again I was chasing them to find out what we were going to do to rectify it.   Their answer was a $350 change order!!!   Like it was my fault or that I changed my mind.   \n\nWhen I called bullshit they get the owner on the phone.   The most condescending, pompous business owner I've met yet in Vegas.   He basically threatens that the project could get even more expensive if I force them to involve engineers to do this right.   They had me over a barrel with a half completed job, so I had to agree to pay them more money to fix their botched design.   If I could figure out how to share their \"change order\" I would.   It is so comically basic that I can't believe they bothered to send it.   They were just doing anything to get my signature to charge the extortion fee.    \n\nHere's the real kicker...they called me on a Sunday night at 8:30 PM to ask for final payment...prior to receiving sign off from the city inspectors!!!!\n\nSHYSTERS with absolutely no care for customer satisfaction or design to do quality work.
