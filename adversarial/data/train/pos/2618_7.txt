Probably the least-pretentious, most reasonably-priced and easiest to get into restaurant at the Wynn. Solid Chinese and Malaysian food on the fairly expansive menu. \n\nI had the vegan cashew \"chick'n,\" which was actually Gardein...a weird sort of fake-meat that tasted exactly like real chicken. My friend had Pad Thai, which he also said was excellent.\n\nThe ambiance is OK -- sort of Asian Brothel chic, with some casino views. One side looks out toward the VIP towers, so it's fun to watch the high-end hookers come and go.\n\nI will DEFINITELY come here again.
