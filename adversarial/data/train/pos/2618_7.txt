I decided to check out Sumi's on Easter Sunday, and I was shocked to find them open.  Every time I come here they seem to be closed so it was the perfect opportunity to test the store out!\n\nAfter seeing pictures on Yelp, I knew i needed a fruit tart, and I ordered a blackberry and raspberry fruit tart ($4).  Sumi's makes a whipped cream based fruit tart, which is typically not my favorite type.  However, the whipped cream was light and amazing, probably the best I have ever eaten.  The berries were delicious as well.  The price, though, is even higher than Pink Box across the street.\n\nI have never been to a Korean bakery so I decided to also test out a mocha bun ($1.50).  It tastes almost like a dinner roll filled with mocha flavored whipped cream.  It was different but delicious.  The bread was good, and the filling was very strongly mocha flavored.  I am really looking forward to testing out other kinds of Korean desserts.\n\nI don't know if this was a holiday thing, but the selection was very very small.  There were only two kinds of fruit tarts when I went it, which was fine but smaller than I thought.  Just fyi!
