We have been in Avondale for 6 years.  We keep passing by TJ's all the time.  We finally FINALLY stop in today.  DUDE, I have been missing out on a good home cooked breakfast!  It is a local mom and pop joint (love those).  The service is super friendly and fast.  The portions are pretty good size and the food is quality stuff.  \n\nWe walked in, they told us pick any table, we sat, and was greeted by our server in 5 seconds.  =)  I told a little long to read up on the menu.  I could not decide between breakfast or lunch.  But since the Yelp reviews were mostly on the breakfast, I can't go wrong!  \n\nI ordered the ranch house omelet (3 eggs, bacon, sausage, and cheddar cheese) and I picked hash browns plus an english muffin.  The omelet was very good, the eggs cooked just right, the bacon isn't that paper thin stuff or crumbled, it was chucks, the sausage was good, and the melting cheddar just made it all come together.  \n\nMy hubby order the chili bean omelet (3 eggs, cheddar cheese, and topped with homemade chili, cheese, and onions).  He loved the omelet, but the chili was too tomato-y for him.  But he loves spicy chili that kick you in the teeth kind (NOT for everyone).  We also order the 3 piece french toast that we did not eat until we finished the omelet.  We should not have waited.  WHAT THE FRENCH TOAST?  Wow, it was SO SO SO SO SO+ good, it melted in our mouths.  3 good sized pieces lighty dusted with powder sugar and we found out the bread is homemade.  The bread is light, doughy, and just DARN good.  \n\nI think I found my new breakfast joint in my neighbor.  Next to come back for lunch and\/or dinner.
