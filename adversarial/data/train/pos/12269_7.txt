4 of us decided to check out this spot on a late friday night and here is what we had:\n\n1. a sample of a few wines \/ cocktails (reasonably priced)\n2. a beautiful cheese selection, which was the result of solid recommendations from the service staff (to pair with our drinks selections)\n3. a mac and cheese (nice and rich!)\n4. the poached pear,  note: must like blue cheese , and 70% + dark chocolate.  \nnote: we asked for more chocolate and it was awesome\n\nworth more visits!
