I would not recommend this place. Me and my buddy went on sunday evening. \nFirst of all the service is very poor, no one was around to even ask for water after the food was served. The malai kofta was uncooked and garlic naan was burnt. We had to wait for 15 mins for someone to come and ask us if everything was ok. \n\nThey killed my apatite and when we were finished we had to go downstairs to notify them ... Damm you!! oh we are done eating, would you pack us the curry and give us the bill...\n\nNo sorry, no nothing...
