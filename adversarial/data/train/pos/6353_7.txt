The worst. This place was recommended by a friend so I really had my hopes up for it. Based on all the reviews, I was absolutely ready to try the food.....too bad I didn't. The service was so horrible that I didn't even get a chance to taste the food. It took 40 mins for the server to even notice we were sitting down so when we moved to the bar to see if the service would be quicker the bartender decided to just give us a dumbfound look and continue serving everyone but us. As much as I would like to give this place another chance, I simply cannot and will not
