If I could give 0 stars, I would. This place is horrible. \n\nIn 2011, my husband and I purchased a 2009 Murano and were told that we would keep the payments at the same price I had with my trade-in. Multiple times I was reassured by the sales guy that we wouldn't have to worry. Low and behold, our payments went up $100 and then they tacked on THOUSANDS to the price because they said that I was upside down in my trade. I KNEW what I owed on my trade and it was NOTHING close to what they were claiming. \n\nFast forward 2 years and we have had more troubles with this car than I have had with any other car I've owned. First off, the stereo volume will shoot up randomly, the steering wheel mechanism failed and the most recent doozy is my AC went out. Everytime I call them to see if it is covered under the FULL EXTENDED WARRANTY that I purchased, they always come back with \"that's the ONE part that your warranty doesn't cover\". Shocker. \n\nThe best part about this whole thing is that my husband called 3 weeks ago to order the part for the AC and we were told that they would have it within 2 days. No such luck. Come to find out, THEY NEVER PLACED THE ORDER!!! I've been driving in the boiling AZ heat with no AC for 3 weeks now because someone was too lazy to tell my husband that the part was back ordered. \n\nI cant wait to trade in this piece of junk that they sold me and go give my business to someone else who actually cares and is honest. \n\nShame on you, Earnhardt.
