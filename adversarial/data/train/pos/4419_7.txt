I have 'NO' complaints on my stay at Luxor. Being a Mlife gold member, I usually stay at the Mirage, Bellagio and New York New York. Luxor really impressed me with what they had to offer. Being one of the lowest tier hotels in Mlife (next to Excalibur), I'd say it was worth it. But really, all you need is a clean and safe room while you're in Vegas unless you want to splurge a bit. \n\nAll the staff we've encountered were very friendly from the reservations agent to the check out clerk. The hotel lobby was clean and inviting but thank God I didn't have to wait in regular long check in line. Our newly renovated Cleo room on the 22nd floor was a total win. I've been reading reviews about the outdated rooms so I only upgraded for only $24 USD a night. Our beds were comfy, lots of lighting and storage for clothes. The bathroom was ok with the walk in shower but the fan was super loud! \n\nMy favorite spot in the resort was the casino! Lots and lots of options for slot machines, much more than the Mirage where we usually stay. The annoying part are the ticket redemption machines located in odd parts of the casino. There's a connected walk way to Mandalay Bay and Excalibur, so no need to walk outside unless you want to take the free tram that runs till 1 am.\n\nI've read that MGM wanted to de-theme Luxor but that will never work! Hence, there's not a lot of Egyptian theme though out the hotel. Ignore the timeshare people!
