Wow, silly me.  Here I was hesitant to look up Appliance Hell-hole, I mean Depot, and leave a negative review.  Sadly I'm not the first, and probably not the last to get screwed over by these douche bags.  I found them through a listing on Craigslist for a smoking hot deal on a \"SXS Kenmore Elite Fridge - $750 (2424 W.UNIV.RD)\"  Too good to be true (and it was).  480-694-9999 (business number) should have been another red flag, as the listing was posted as such:  Just completed home remodel and selling my stainless Kenmore Elite refrigerator model # 106.55603400 Fridge is in great shape normal wear.. Ice cold with built in ice maker and new water line. All drawers and shelves. Really good unit!Sears extended warranty goo until 5\/2015. \n$700 O.B.O\" \n\nSounded like an appliance by owner listing right?  Even the misspellings, obo, and of course the \"just completed home remodel.\"  I call them up and come over, low and behold it's a shyster appliance store.  The SXS must mean scam + screw over, instead of side by side.  The \"deal\" I was looking for \"had just sold\" fortunately for me they had more, so I foolishly purchased an identical one (looked like the same in the picture on craigslist) for 875, plus the warranty listed on the ad - that's their rinky dink warranty they tell you have 30 days parts and labor on the fridge.  The same day shipping they promised - delayed by two days, all on account of they \"needed a big truck with a lift gate to deliver it to a residential address.\"  Piece of crap shows up on the back of some twenty year old fixer up pick up truck!  The two idiots unload it like they were taught at the Helen Keller moving school for idiots.  They roll the fridge in, sans skirt at the bottom because that broke when they dropped it on the ground unloading it, plug it in, as I was told they would \"make sure the fridge would be running and working prior to leaving.\"  They also were willing to take my old fridge away to be \"recycled\" for free, so I figured, awesome, one less problem.  After  all I was tired of looking at it as it had a bad compressor, and the front door was scratched\/bent diagonally down the right side from me moving it years ago.  WRONG!  They leave and I notice the temp hasn't gone down, I wait an hour, two, three, I call them back and was told \"oh you need to wait at least 8 hours before it cools down.\"  Fast forward to the next day, still the same temperature, they finally send some douche bag who's supposedly their certified repair tech.  He says; \"ohh the compressor is burnt out, that's probably due to a surge in power through the electrical system; you should claim that under your home warranty.\"  The other option was they could order a new compressor and install for ooohh $500! Right then and there I knew I had been f*cked, and I mean proper f*cked too.  So here I am with a POS fridge bad from moment one, and they're bending me over the barrel.  Much like the other reviews the scum bag who sold it to me apparently goes in to the witness protection program, never to be seen or heard from again.  I go back with the fridge in my friend's truck and demand a refund, while I'm waiting for these idiots to finish their \"who's on first, what's on third\"  Abbot and Costello routine on how they're not giving my money back I look over and low and behold MY OLD FRIDGE with a sales sign for $900!  Yup same fridge, same diagonal bend and scratch down the door.  Long story short they gave back $300 cash and told me to hit the road.  Their scam is simple, they get old fridges blow a little life back in them and sell them to simpletons like me.  Save yourself the frustration and NEVER come here.....
