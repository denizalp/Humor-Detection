So I'm not sure if my opinion really counts here. I only tried two thing from the menu one was AWESOME and the other really not.  Maybe I was extremely hungry but those nachos were simply delish! The cheese was yummy, chips with a perfect crunch! LOL. Here comes the sad news, the shrimp that came with the fajitas were really good but the fajitas beside them self were super subpar.  I'd try it, maybe get a salad with shrimp and shake or something if theres a next time! :) The customer service was really nice though!
