The pro: the only Lee's Sandwiches in Arizona\nThe con: the only Lee's Sandwiches in Arizona\n\nHad a huge hankering for a Banh Mi (Vietnamese sandwich) and missing home where Lee's presence is abundant. Lee's has a pretty large menu, which is typical and sells everything from sandwiches, drinks, pastries, snacks to desserts.\n\nCame in to order a #10 Cured Pork & Pork Sandwich, typically most Banh Mi's come with slices of Jalapeno, Cilantro, Pickled Carrot and Daikon, slathered with mayo and Pate and stuffed with cured meats, such as Cha Lua (cured pork sausage) or other types of deli ham encased in a French baguette. My sandwich was sorely lacking, with only two springs of cilantro, one slice of Jalapeno and literally 4 thinly sliced pieces of ham. Absolutely disappointed, all this in a 10 inch baguette.\n\nI also ordered a Jackfruit Smoothie with boba and found the smoothie absolutely watered down and super sweet. The boba was also not well cooked and not flavored.\n\nDefinitely disappointed in my experience here. Spent $ on food served with the bare minimum of quality and service.\n\nThis place is also CASH ONLY. If you're a plastic carrying gal like me, you might have to suffer with paying a fee to withdraw from their ATM in the corner.
