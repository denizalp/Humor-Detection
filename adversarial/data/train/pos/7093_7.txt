Boy, I didn't know fire extinguishers are so much work.\n\nLet me start off by saying that I called many companies before arriving at this one, everywhere I called they wanted $30+ to check\/recertify my fire extinguisher. \nNormally I wouldn't spend a dime on things like this but because I am becoming a foster\/adoptive parent I am required to have a 5lb ABC fire extinguisher.\n\nI called this company,  Penny I think was very polite she advised that she can come to my home and do it for $25.00. I told her that I need it done now and if I could go to her, she said sure she gave me directions and what not. Upon arrival I was greeted by Doug and the wife, I began to explain my ignorance on the matter they laughed as did I, Doug says, \"just charge her $20.00.\" \n\nOver all I was very pleased in the matter and could highly recommend using their company.\n\nIt took about 10 minutes to recharge that bad boy and I was on my way. \n\nThanks, I really appreciate the help!
