I have left a review before with 5 stars, because this is a 5-star church. However, this review is for another reason. The only negative thing I could ever say about Canyon Ridge, is that people are allowed to smoke outside of the doors, very close to the building. It is not my business that people choose to slowly kill themselves with this horrible, toxic addiction, but I, nor my child should have to be exposed to 2nd hand smoke that these people are giving off.  I just don't think it's fair. Hopefully in the very near future, there can be a designated smoking area away from Base Camp and the main auditorium. God bless!
