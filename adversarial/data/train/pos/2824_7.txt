I will have to agree with my yelp friend Colaine B., you will either love love love this place or HATE it.Thank god I'm not from the latter category.\n\nSo for me eating has to come with an experience be it at high end restaurant or street kinda joints.The experience must leave a memory and a sense of urge to come back.\n\nKensington market is my most fav place for quick eats and I can happily spend my entire day being there.\n\nSo here's my day at KM.I love to start with coffee at Cafe Pamenar  along with a bagel from the historic Nu Bagel.\n\nThen with a full belly I like to stroll around and shop for fruits which are fresh and much cheaper than regular grocery store.I also pay a visit to this store which has amazing organic honey and breads.I just don't remember the name :(\n\nBy this time I'm so so hungry for the best tacos from Seven Lives Taco.I usually end my day with churros from Panchos.\n\nI highly recommend this place for delicious and quick eats.Though there are many fancier spots to eat here as well but I always end up choosing repeating my favorites here.\n\nTip:-When here be ready for tons of walking and comfy shoes are a must.
