The trend of 'Fusion Food' was bound to happen because since people have been immigrating into this fine country of ours, we have been fusing our native homelands food with what we have available or because we are just so damn creative. Seriously, you can stick almost anything in a tortilla and BAM, fusion food!\n\nTrattoria Nakamura-Ya is the fusion of two great cuisines- Italian and Japanese. The menu is quite extensive with items that are Japanese and Italian but many items that are a combination of both. \n\nI met a fellow Yelp Elite here for dinner and as usual we shared our plates. We ordered prosecco and wine first because not only do us Yelpers like to eat, we also like a little drinky-drink. We decided on four items to share- two appetizers and two pasta dishes. \n\nThe appetizers which I seriously recommend are the Octopus Capriccio and the Pork Shabu Shabu Salad. Both were solid especially the Octopus. I honestly think this one dish is great for both novice and veteran octopi eaters. It was fresh and anything with the word Capriccio, you know will be a hit. \n\nFor the pastas, we ordered the Uni pasta and the Kinoko which is a creamy meat sauce. With the Kinoko you have a choice of pasta, we chose linguine which was a good choice because the pasta itself is thicker and can hold the sauce quite well. The dish is your traditional creamy meat sauce but with Waygu beef. Very nice! The Uni pasta was also a good choice because the Uni was not strong and did not overpower the sauce. There may have not been as much Uni as I would have liked but maybe my sharing partner hogged it all. It is a toss up!\n\nEverything was great and the portions were good. Of all the fusion style restaurants or food trucks that I have been to, I have never had Italian and Japanese together. Trattoria Nakamura-Ya was an excellent introduction to combining both cuisines! So fabs!
