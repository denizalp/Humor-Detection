Always delicious! I've just about tried everything and even flavors I normally do not enjoy like lemon flavors, I can appreciate in their creations. \n\nI think I'll always be a regular as long as they keep making cupcakes.\n\nJust wanted to add to give the cookies a try too. Big cookies for a dollar and their chocolate chip and sugar&cinnamon cookies are good, but to me the super chunk cookies (has white, chocolate, butterscotch, peanut butter chips) is the star which the apparently make on Saturdays. \n\nGive them a go. \n\nSeriously if we ever sell our house I will be sure to list Retro Bakery under amenities\/ neighborhood attractions in our listing. I know I'm not the only nut who looks for baked goods and granite countertop while finding a home....right?
