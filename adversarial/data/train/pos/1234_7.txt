Am I the only one who mourns the death of the Imperial Palace? Sure, it was rundown and old and kinda crappy. And, ok, you probably couldn't have paid me to stay in one of their rooms. But it was dive-y and had a fun element of adventure to it. But bring in The Quad...\n\nIn the grand trend of no theme (I mourn the loss of theme resorts too) and just prettiness, The Quad has aimed for just that. But on the cheap side of that. What once was an adventure is now a non-distinct walk through a bland casino. There is nothing to entice you to stay here. The table games aren't even that cheap. And there's nothing to see. It's an air-conditioned refuge from The LINQ and the hot summer heat. And that's about it. And the parking garage still sucks.
