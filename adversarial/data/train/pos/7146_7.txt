NOT another Buffet...but yes, we were dragged kicking and screaming!!!  Regardless, it was actually pretty darn good.  Yes I over ate as one of my colleagues held a crab claw to my throat and forced it down me. \n\nAlthough I have to admit, the king crab legs were really good and the seafood bar was pretty decent.  Moreover the carving station was good as well.  The prime rib was flavorful and NOT over cooked.  They had a really decent selection and I as always ate way too much.  I wasn't able to venture to the desert bar, but did wobble my fat ass out on my own power.\n\nDid I mention how much I hate buffets!!!
