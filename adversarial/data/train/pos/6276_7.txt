Just like Danielle's review below, do not let looks turn you away. The food here is phenomenal!  I was a bit confused at first by the menu of American, and Mexican food, on top of Thai... We too wanted the buffet, but it was a bit late (Technically it's a lunch buffet from what I get), and were treated to ordering off the menu, and Joann,  the owner, brought along a whole host of other goodies to go with our food, for us to try. My Green Coconut Curry Chicken was presented beautifully, and unlike most  Green Curry Chicken I've had in the area, the sauce was creamy, instead of soupy, and had a fabulous green chile flavor to it.... delightfully spicy, with flavor to back it up.  My dad ordered the Thai Basil Chicken which was also spectacular, bursting with flavor. My mom ordered the Pad Thai, which far surpassed any other Pad Thai I have tried too. I've eaten at plenty of Thai places, coast to coast, and the food here is at least on par, and may just surpass the best that Hollywood's Thai Town has to offer.  The meal was ended with dreamy Coconut Ice Cream, with finely ground peanut on top, along with Palm Seed!!! Everything here tastes genuine, and homemade. The prices are very good too, and the Thai Iced tea is also great.\nThe Owner\/cook brings much experience to the table, having cooked for Pink Pepper, and a host of other well known eateries, in the past. \nI CANNOT WAIT to go back VERY soon, and try some other stuff! SO SO GOOD!!!
