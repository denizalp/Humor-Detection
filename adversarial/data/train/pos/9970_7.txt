I showed up with about 15 other women on a Saturday (April 25th) night around 11 PM.  We were placed on the guest list so we didn't have to wait in line very long at all.  It probably took about 20 minutes to get through the very long lines.\n\nAs soon as we got off the elevator, we were seated on the 3rd floor, I believe...I don't drink at all, but somehow that night was a blur because there were so much going on and so many people everywhere.  Our lovely hostess poured everyone a drink and asked me what I wanted.  When I told her I just wanted orange juice, she smiled and poured me a glass of OJ.  Beautiful and great service from our hostess!\n\nThe venue was very big.  There are multiple rooms\/floors with different music for each location.  My friends wanted to check out every floor so we made our way through the crowds and decided that we just wanted to go back & sit at our table.\n\nI love Vegas for many reasons...the FOOD, the beautiful hotels, the fact that it's a city that never sleeps and you can wear whatever you want and no one will judge you.  However, I'm not big on clubbing and I do not drink so those fun factors do not attract me too much.  I'm pretty much what you would call a party pooper.  Lol\n\nI ended up leaving the club before everyone else at around midnight.  I felt dizzy from all the loud music, the dancing lights, and the walking back and forth.  However, I have to admit that was the best glass of OJ I've had in a very long time.  Must be because it was served to me by a very beautiful lady...hehehe
