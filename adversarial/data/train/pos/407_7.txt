Its a strip bar, and if you're not down for that, please don't come in. Upstairs is the classier version with a cover fee. Otherwise just roll on in, no cover and girls girls girls. \n\nSome girls can dance, and do actual pole work. Others the young ones just hold onto the pole and move their hips around it. Not really impressive. Course you don't tip them while you're on stage, they take your money during the lap dances. Which they take you away into a \"private\" room with a few other strippers doing lap dances. They say the dance is one song, but damn , our friends were gone for a good 3 or 4 songs, one was gone for half an hour! \n\nIf you're a girl and you come in with  guys, the strippers won't attack you. They pick off the weak ones, usually the guys who are alone or with other guys. For some reason if you have a female there, the strippers don't bother you. Not that it matters. \n\nLike all strip clubs, you gotta keep ordering drinks, but seriously can i finish my over priced soda first before you tell me i have to order another one? You want me to chug down this soda so i have to pee up a wildstorm while ordering another drink? seriously. could you give me 20 minutes?\n\nAnd with every strip club there's always a group of seedy guys there. Apparently Rubeus Hagrid from harry potter is a regular there. He's always trying to grope all the strippers for free and not take them into the champagne room, which they push like crazy there. \n\nBut just remember it's a nudie bar, have fun, bring a girl if you don't want to be harassed to death. ANd if you're a girl, enjoy and look around. And yes during the lap dance, the girl is topless, and she lets you touch them. Yeah you wanted to know.
