This is the second preschool my son has been to and he graduated recently from Pre-K.  I felt this daycare provided a much better learning curriculum with daily letters, shapes and numbers. He even got to the point where they were writing words.\n\nHis last preschool was mainly teaching them things about the world and science, which is great, but children 4 to 5 years old should be learning how to write and read letters before trying to understand how a volcano works or how bears live in the wild.\n\nThe school gets a great rating for the teaching curriculum which I feel is the most important thing with a good Pre-K, preparing a child for the potentially upcoming \"shock\" of starting school, but the classes did seem a little crowded and chaotic when picked up, might have just been because it was towards the end of the day. He has never complained of getting hurt, bullied, or mistreated in any way.
