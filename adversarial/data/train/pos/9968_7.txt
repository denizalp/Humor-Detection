Driving back to LA and need that In & Out fix?  Forget about the one off of Flamingo that everyone's hip to head about 4 miles south on the 15 and get off on Blue Diamond Road.  Head west one block off the highway and you're there.\n \nCompared to the other location by the strip, this location is considered desolate of people.  Head here to avoid the madness at the other location.
