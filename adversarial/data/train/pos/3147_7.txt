I fulfilled my noodle craving in this centrally located noodle shop today!\n\nAs you walk in, you'll notice a nice, open, minimalistic, clean atmosphere.  You're served with yummy watermelon infused water.  Your utensils have a traditional look to them.  Your server does a great job explaining the menu.\n\nI ordered the Dan Dan Noodles and spicy wontons.  The Dan Dan noodles had quite a bit of kick to it since it's minced pork mixed with some chilli oil.  Got the hand pulled noodles.  You can tell the noodles were handmade, just by the texture and taste.  \n\nThe spicy wontons came in a small bowl, but had more wontons than you'd expect.  They're a smaller size, but they're shareable between 2 people and filling.  I believe the wontons were mixed with some chilli oil and a little bit of soy sauce.  Excellent flavor.  \n\nAlso, prices are very reasonable (less than $10).  My filling Dan Dan Noodle was $7.99.  \n\nI'd like to try the chicken and mushroom noodles next time.
