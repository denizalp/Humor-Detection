i am really pissed right now...this is an example of how lazy people are and it will cost you my business going forward. I have eaten here once before i liked it,so me and my father decided on what we wanted . i went to call my order in @ 11:40 am and i asked the lady do you have any specials? her response was that i have to come in to read them...wtf? are you really so lazy that you cant read off specials for a customer?her response was that at 11:45 am she was too busy to read them to me...sorry ,UNACCEPTABLE !!!!! I am really getting sick and tired of bs service,especially in this town. this behavior costs businesses customers on an exponential level...the food was good but this made me so angry that i will never walk in there again I wouldn't want to burden them with my business,obviously they have too many customers as it is... deplorable service.....
