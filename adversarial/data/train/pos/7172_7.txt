Based on my recent visit:\n10\/29\/2013 at 12:10pm\n\nWorst possible service ever from Order Taker Kristen.\n\nI've been craving some Jimmy John's for over a week now and when I saw their sign today I decided that I knew what I was going to have for lunch. I pull up to a crammed parking lot and manage to find a spot close by.\n\n\"Ahhh\" the sigh of relief when I make my way to the establishment. Being in such a wonderful mood I walk in with anticipation of cheerful greetings (which is what I love about this company) but to my surprise I get a stare.\n\n\"Hello\", \"How are you?\", or \"What are we having today?\"... none of these phrases were said. I was about to walk out but wanted the sandwich so bad! So I bared a grin and told the girl what I wanted. \n\n\"That it?\"\n\nO.o \"Excuse me?\"\n\n\"Is that it?\"\n\nI was beyond peeved but my mission was to get a sub regardless of service. I told the girl no onions and I had to read the register to know my total because she didn't say. I handed her my card and waited there for my receipt.\n\nWaiting... waiting... (I think I heard grass grow)...\n\n\"Oh you get your receipt when you get your food\"\n\nShe never asked me if I wanted it for here or to go so I grabbed my sub and left the building. I don't like to review a place unless it knocks my socks off or pushes my buttons. This place really pushed my button.\n\nI will try this place out again but not for a while. I hope the next time I come here things will be better, because I really like their food and the location is near my school.
