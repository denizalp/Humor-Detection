Based on the reviews, either you love it or hate it. This is not the case with me. I could take it or leave it. The store is a walk up window next to a convenience store\/ gas station. I arrived Sunday morning just minutes after opening. There were several people waiting to pick up orders. The crew was working feverishly and somewhat chaotically to fill the orders. after a few minutes one person noticed me standing at the window and took my order. I then joined the several other people waiting for pick up. 54 degrees is not freezing, but when you don't have a jacket it can be a little chilly. After 7 minutes they started calling out order numbers. \nI chose to eat in my warm car rather than the patio. I ordered the breakfast burrito supreme. This consisted of scrambled egg, bacon, ham, potatoes, and cheese wrapped in a flour tortilla. My wife got the bacon egg burrito. They offered sauce which I regrettably declined as the burrito was kind of dry and bland. This was surprising because the bacon egg burrito my wife got was way salty. I took a bite to compare. What was also different was mine was barely warm and hers was very warm. My bacon was tough, almost burnt, hers was good. This inconsistency leads me to believe that they make these things in batches and not as they are ordered.\nThis is not the best fast food burrito I have had. Sorry Burrito Express, Jack in the Box or Filiberto's have you beat.
