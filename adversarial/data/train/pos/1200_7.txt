Gah!  Avoid!  AVOID!!!!!!!\n\nThey even have the Coty brand \"Eu de Toilette\" behind lock and key here.  This should tell you something.\n\nI firmly believe that at least a quarter of the submissions to peopleofwalmart.com come from this place.  Screaming, unsupervised kids, jerks using their phones on SPEAKER (yeah, like I wanna hear about your man doin' time), long lines S L O W moving cashiers.\n\nIt's crazy, it's crowded, it's messy, it's understaffed, and NO ONE CARES.\nGo to the one in Mayfield.  Go to the one on Macedonia.  \n\nUnless, of course, you want to torture yourself.
