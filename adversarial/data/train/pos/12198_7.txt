This Convention Center is great.  It is really clean they have food courts, starbucks and Amex Louge in the main lobby area. \n\nThey have a bunch of different halls where they display the vendor booths. This place is huge so make sure you bring good shoes and a backpack. \n\nOverall experience was great time.
