SCAM, SCAM, SCAM!!!!\n\n\n\nIf you want to waste 5-6 hours of your life go for it, otherwise avoid this scam at all costs. \n\n\nFinally when they knew we weren't buying (after the third Manager) they got rude and had the nerve to tell us we were wasting their time. \n\nEvery other one star review is right on. \nI seriously doubt the four or five stars are real!\n\nIf you've seen the South Park episode regarding timeshares this is it times 10.
