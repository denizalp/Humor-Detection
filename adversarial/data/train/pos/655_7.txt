10 check-ins and I'm the Duke! \n\nThis is my review it is almost sickeningly green in here these lime green plastic chairs are hard on the eyes. It's like you want to eat and get out. Tne walls and a good chunk of the ceiling are also bright ass green. Most of the tables wobble, it's usually packed and loud. But damned if the food doesn't keep bringing me back even though it is 10 miles from my house so 2 stars on interior 4 stars on food.
