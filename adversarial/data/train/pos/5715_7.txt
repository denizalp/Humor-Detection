We went to Nan and Byron's last night and sat in the front room. We were absolutely starving and glad they could take us right away with no reservation. \n\nI ordered the meatloaf, which had sriracha ketchup and it was delicious. For my sides I had peas and carrots and mojito fries. Yes, that's right. Mojito. Fries. It's like a hint of lime chip but a little more sophisticated. Yummy.\n\nI gave it 4 and not 5 stars because I asked for Brussels sprouts since many yelpers were raving about them. She said they were seasonal. I asked if there was a comparable vegetable equally good right now. She said no and said since it's Sunday they didn't really have much. Your restaurant is open 7 days per week, no? A restaurant of this status (especially one that offers 2 vegetable sides with each meal) should offer seasonal\/green\/good options on each day of the week.
