*This review applies to non-douchebaggery days of Sun-Thurs, before the tinder crowd that rolls in around 10ish  \n\nThe definition a classic bar. dark atmosphere, large display of bottles, mood lighting and  bartenders who not only know their trade, but take pride in it as well. Engaged in convo but not to the level of someone working at Dutch Bro's. \n\nYou might find yourself with a few other folks and it's just wonderful.\n\nFri\/Sat is a #SS with people who don't know how to act at such a bar (yes i'm old) and I generally stay away..but hey..if that's your thing and you enjoy the company of kids who need to check if they can afford two rounds...vaya con dios.
