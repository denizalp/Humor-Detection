DO NOT GO HERE! Oh my God, I didn't realize we can post reviews for hotel here otherwise I would have done this a lot sooner.  I was here last year on Labor day weekend.  Let me just say this is the most worst and unprofessional Westin I have been to and will not be back for a long time.  First off...they put us on the floor where the pets were (we reserved 3 rooms) we didn't realize it until we heard a bunch of dogs barking...not only that a bunch of us got bed bug bites all over our back.  (sickening) then we ordered room service, they messed up on that order and then it took about a whole hour to receive my refund which they didn't even do correctly and refunded back the whole bill when they were suppose to just refund 1 item (idiots! but that's good for me) to top it all off, my friends booked 2 separate couple massages only 1 couple massage happened because they woman that booked the appointment thought it was only for one couple well in fact we clearly said on the phone.  It was a disaster!!  They only compensation was a free massage (only to be used at the Westin Las Vegas)\n\nthis place is pathetic!  Maybe others have had a more pleasant stay but ours was a nightmare.\n\nMight I lastly add, I learned that this a privately owned Westin which probably explains that sorry ass service.
