One things I miss about being a college student in Pittsburgh is this place. It's hard to find any other city where you get half price and delicious food in large quantities this late at night.\n\nLate night starts from 11pm-1am when the kitchen closes. During this time, mostly everything is half off except for some of the big platters, seafood dishes, and drinks.\n\nRecommendations:\nWings - messy but so good, I always go with the standard buffalo but the other flavors are great too, wings are large, crispy, and juicy.\n\nDip sticks - Definitely pay that $1 extra and add the mozz. Great rosemary flatbread and marinara sauce. Cheese makes it even better.\n\nRoll-a-fatty - Kind of like a calzone but better because it's half off and you get extra marinara sauce to dip.\n\nPizzas - A little bigger than a personal pan, but easily finished by one person. I like the Classic Maggie and all the ones with lots of MEAT. My friends always get the Smashed Potato, but I've never liked it since it tastes likes salad on a pizza.\n\nI've never been here not during late night so no idea how it is during normal hours, but it's always been crowded every time I've been here.It's especially crowded on Thurs-Sat. because of all the college students. Don't be surprised with up to an hour's wait. Best time to go though is to get there either around 10:30pm to wait in line for late night to begin, or around 12-12:30pm right before their kitchen closes.
