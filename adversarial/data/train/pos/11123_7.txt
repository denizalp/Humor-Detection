It's hard to be hard on a hardware store. As long as they have the thing you came in looking for, all should be fine. What bothered me about my trip to this Lowe's was no one seemed all that informed about what department can help you or not.\n\nI had a pipe, and I needed to get it cut down. So I went to plumbing. There a gentleman, who wasn't doing anything, told me he could not and to try Electrical. (Actually, what he said was, \"Yeah - no. You might try.... uh... you might go to Electrical, because.... that's not... something.....\" Then even he had enough of his inability to communicate and stopped trying. I moved on to Electrical, and left him in peace to research whatever it was that was so important on his computer. (Sudoku? GED courses? Playmate of the Month? I will never know.)\n\nI moved on to the Electrical Department. They pointed me in the direction of lumber. Lumber just said, flatly, that they couldn't cut a steel pipe with their saws, just lumber. What I loved here was that I was told this as if I was the moron. I know you can't cut steel with a ripsaw, and told this person that Electrical sent me. The Lumber guy said I should go to Plumbing. (\"There's a hole in the bucket, dear Liza, dear Liza.\" Anyone else remember that song?)\n\nUltimately I found someone in some department who happened to have a hack saw and a measuring tape. So I cut the pipe myself, thanked this solitary helpful employee, and went to pay for my goods. \n\nThankfully, there is a Home Depot not too far north on Indian Bend. I would go there instead.
