I fly SWA just about every single week for the past 5 years for work, mostly the west coast. Are they perfect? I got news for ya ... Nobody is so here are some comments and observations from yours truly. \n\nThey create the persona of being a low cost carrier but thier prices are all over place. Some are incredibly cheap while others are incredibly expensive. You need an algorithm to figure it out. I am a \"A list preferred\" guy but never purchase business class so typically im the incredibly handsome guy standing in A16. lol.\n\n I have way too many free drink tickets than i will ever use. I love their peanuts. They typically keep things lighthearted which scores major points with me. Checked bags fly free. \n\nCompanion pass holder here and trust me, it gets used religiously during the summer. \n\nI hate being crammed in a row with 3 people any longer than 90 minutes. WIFI is horrendous, good thing i get it for free.\n\n The Free television is nice and works o.k. On time departure is not always there but i mean who among us has absolute power over the weather? I was once on a plane that got struck by lightening in Kansas City! \n\nI love the points program and use my Chase SWA card for all business travel expenses. Oh! SWA is the largest carrier in & out of vegas. \n\nI advise everyone to steer clear of Spirit and Frontier. Book it on SWA. Not all planes have WIFI, especially the older 300 series 737's. The new 800 series are pretty nice!\n\n The employees here make it great, especially when they randomly belt out a tune. They make everyone feel special.\n\n 99% of the time, the flights are full and the flight attendants hustle big time to serve drinks & snacks. SWA is all i have ever flown in the past 5 years.\n\n 2016 had me clock 125 one way flights, thats how much i \"luv\" SWA!
