I'm very discombobulated. I really had my heart set on some excellent Popeyes Chicken. \nI've learned over the years to ask up front for the kick-ass \"Cajun Sparkle\" that complements their chicken perfectly. Anymore it seems half of them don't even carry it anymore. \nIt took me 20 minutes to get here and im too lazy to go anywhere else. \nThe chicken was good. Could have been better but I've already explained why. \nThere were many black people there. I liked that. I don't feel I'm at Popeyes if I'm surrounded by \"whitey\".
