I came to his place today at approximately 4:20pm because it was near seafood city and I was craving for some Thai tea. \n\nI came into the store, no acknowledgement from the cashier whatsoever. Customer service is bad and they don't serve water! What kind of establishment especially serving hot plate food not have drinking water? People who consume food and drink sweet drinks will be dehydrated and worst of all water is needed to flush down the excess regimen to digest properly. Beware, this place does not serve water! The Thai tea is good but the service could have been better.
