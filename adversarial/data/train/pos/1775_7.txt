RA's the place you visit if you're going out in Old Town and want to have dinner and drinks at a sceney place before you do. RA's the place you visit if you want a good deal on happy hour. RA is pretty consistent in everything they produce. Nothing is spectacular, but everything is decent. \n\nWhenever I visit RA, it's crowded with people and the scene is lively. Between the sushi and the other food, everything is pretty run of the mill good here. I've had the chicken teriyaki which has a nice zing to it and is a nice meal option if I don't feel like sushi. The sushi here is pretty spot-on as well. They make the sushi fresh at the sushi counter and I've never had a bad roll here. They have everything from Caterpillar and Las Vegas rolls, to California and shrimp tempura rolls. \n\nRAs happy hour is great. The drinks and food are very reasonably priced and their Sunday happy hour is awesome too. \n\nThe location is nice since it's right in the heart of Old Town and like I said, it's a great spot to get some food in the system before the night gets started.
