So I won't lie..:I do love the sushi here. I work not too far and this is a great spot to order online and pick up when we don't have a lunch. Unfortunately, the customer service here is lacking. We have ordered here many times and the order is never ready on time. Online it gives you a pick up time. Today I waited an extra 20 minutes for my order despite giving them an hour to make 4 rolls.  This has happened every time unfortunately. They also don't seem to care too much and tend to forget or not pay attention to details (asking for spicy mayo or leaving out fish eggs etc.). For a place with a ton of staff and good sushi, it's a shame they are not properly trained on customer service. \nThey also don't accept debit.
