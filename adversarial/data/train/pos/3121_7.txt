How can you go wrong for $35 1 hour of foot massage! It is way awwesome! This place is legit it's not one of those trashy sleezy asian massage parlors.. They start the massage by soaking your feet and they massage your head and arms while your feet is soaked.. Then after they do pressure points on your feet.. Hence it is FOOT REFLEXOLOGY.. My guy K he does it really hard and hits all the points.. After the feet is done they turn you over and massage your back.. This place is worth it! The only thing i didnt like about it was the rooms were divided by chinese wall fans you can hear everyone coming in and out.. I was annoyed one time when a woman came in talking very loud! But other than that this place is awesome and well worth it! Sometimes i feel like im cheating them cause its so damn cheap so I usually tip 15-20$ \n\nThey are open 10am-10pm
