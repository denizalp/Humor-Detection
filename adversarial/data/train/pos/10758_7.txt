This place is extremely odd. I came in and the host was on the phone so I just bypassed him and sat at an empty seat at the bar. Immediately after the bartender asks me if I'm eating dinner because people at bianco next door were supposed to take my seat. Instead he tells me I have to sit in the portion of the bar that's partially outdoors and he'd open the \"garage door\" for me. Host doesn't approach me or apologize. I'm not asking for free things just basic good service and acknowledgement for mistakes. \n\nFinally sit and have some food. I know they're trying to be the fancier sibling next door but the service and food was just clunky. I got offered an amuse Bouche? Or at least I think. It was a slice of cheese. One grape tomato. And one Olive. Yup haha. \n\nThe saving grace was the copa de testa app which was delicious. I also had the double cut porkchop which was ok. Great seasoning but I'd rather have a smaller cut with sides\/ a more composed dish. My plate was literally a huge chunk of pork and a few peppers on top. \n\nOverall good effort but service and food need refinement especially at these prices.
