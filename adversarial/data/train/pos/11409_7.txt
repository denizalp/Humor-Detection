This place is awesome. Came here because I wanted to get my pup out of the house and I was hungry... They welcomed us both!!! It's hard to find good dog friendly spots around town, but this is my new favorite! I met the owner Robert and he actually took time out of his day to sit and talk to us, which I love because owners never do that. He was the nicest guy and filled me in on Rambos history! Tammy our waitress, was on it! She was super friendly and extremely sweet! I will definitely come back more!
