I feel like this place is trying to rely on the name to get established at this location. I've received better service at a TGIFridays. I understand this is a new location but I don't think anyone in this place that I dealt with tonight was trained on service.  The three different servers that came to my table were just as rude as each other. I felt like I was at Dicks Last Resort. The server made the assumption we were done with our food and took it off the table before we were finished.  Failed to even ask if we were finished or if she could take the plates. The last time I checked, if I still have food on my plate the chances are pretty good I'm not done with it. \nThe food was not comparable to anything else in Crocker Park and I don't mean that in a good way. The calamari was barely cooked and to top it off they serve it in a brown paper bag? The humus platter looked like it was put together by a line cook at McDonalds. Completely dissatisfied with the entire experience. I hate to bash the place but step your game up, especially at a higher end location.  \nTo top it off they crammed a three piece band into a corner which eliminated at least a dozen chairs from the bar because of how loud they were. The music was good but not practical to say the least. I feel like management fumbled with this place and I would not return. Especially with the other options within walking distance. Only thing I could think of would be to send your staff (kitchen and servers) over to your Brecksville location for training. I've always had a pleasant experience over there. \nAgain, I hate to bash this hard but if you don't know then you can't fix it.
