With a menu is guided by the principles of sustainability, a wine\/beer\/or sake pairing for every item on the menu, and several well composed dishes, David Clawson Restaurant is certainly worth checking out!\n\nDCR is definitely the best food in the Anthem Hills area...though that's not saying much...but still it is a welcome addition.  The drink pairing were very well thought out!  We took part in multiple pairings and this was one of my favorite aspects.  DCR did their homework with the pairings and it paid off!  I was impressed with how many items were offered by the glass for a restaurant this size, and hope they can sustain this approach!\n\nWe enjoyed the following items:\npork- Certainly liked the achara & pear with this pork belly\noyster- Delightfully fresh and bright...I'm a sucker for ponzu w\/ oysters \nsalad - Avocado & pomegranate play so nice with salmon\ntuna - Like to addition of scallop and yuzu\nlamb - Wonderfully cooked and seasoned\nfruit - You had me at sticky\nrice - This was an excellent idea for a dish...think uni risotto.  We would have like to have had more uni as it was a little thin compared to the portion of rice, but for the price the uni portion made sense.  \n\nHere is a look at the menu when they opened:\n\nbread                    milk bread, plugra butter, alaea red salt                                   \npork                      pork belly, achara, asian pear                                                                  \noyster                   *kusshi, ponzu, daikon, chives                                              \nvegetarian            asparagus, shiitake, meyer lemon                                                 \nsalad                    *hamachi, avocado, pomegranate                                         \nsoup                     red pepper, sambuca, basil                          \ntuna                      *ahi, scallop, tobiko, yuzu                                                          \nliver                      foie gras, pear, ginger, shallot jam                                          \ncrab                      jumbo lump, persimmon, shallot                 \nlamb                     chop, shishito, olive, muhammara                                             \nchicken                organic, achiote, green chile, macaroni                                               \nshrimp                  black tiger, corn, jicama, chorizo                                             \nwhitefish               sea bass, white miso, kabayaki, bok choy                \nbeef                      tenderloin, sambal, balsamic, mushroom            \nduck                     leg confit, lemon, honey, blueberry                                 \nrice                       niigata koshihikari, uni, reggiano cream                                  \nsalmon                 horseradish, cucumber, mustard                                    \nscallop                 *hokkaido, tamari, finger lime, ikura                                          \npotato                   yukon gold, garlic, ham hock                                                    \nveal                      cheek, polenta, gremolata                                                  \nmushroom            portobello, balsamic, feta cheese                                             \nnoodles                shanghai, garlic, more garlic                                                                                         \nfruit                       sticky apricot love, vanilla cream, toffee                          \nchocolate             crunchy praline valrhona, tangerine                                   \nbrulee                   bailey's irish cr√®me   \n      \ncheese                 epoisses, fig, truffle honey, quince                                     \n\nDCR is most certainly a 5 Star, \"As Good As It Gets\" option for this area of town, and with a few modifications I'd consider garnishing them with 5.  I'm sure we'll go out of our way to make it back at some point.\n\nDavid was in the kitchen the night we came in.  He made point to come by and was very genuine and down to earth.  I like his approach to food and service.
