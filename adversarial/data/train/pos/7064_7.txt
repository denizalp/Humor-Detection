Horrible service here. I purchased 2 gift certificates and I needed to break them into 3. The girls working here would not do it because they said I was using a gift card to purchase a gift card. I told them I bought the gift card and I needed to break them down. The snooty broads and so called manager were no help. I highly discourage people to go here. Horrible customer service.
