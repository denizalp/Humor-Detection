Happy Veteran's Day!  Salute to you & dad!  \n\nDad never goes to get anything free, but I told him that he deserves it.  In Iowa, they were not ever offered anything.  I think all service men & women deserve to be appreciated daily.\n\nDaniel & Chad our servers at the bar were super busy & almost overwhelmed.  They told me that if you are waiting for table w\/ a buzzer you get 50% off of wine while you wait.  I had no clue!  $9.99 all you can eat pasta & my fav $7.99 unlimited soup (chicken & gnocchi) & salad. The new menu has spicy items so mom got the same crispy spicy ravioli she did last time & off of the Veterans menu, Dad got the Garlic Rosemary Chicken w\/ mashed potatoes.  All very good!!\n\nWhen we left, they thanked Dad for his service & were very kind.  Hugs & love to our service people.  Thank you & that you participating businesses for showing love!
