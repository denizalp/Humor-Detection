After being screwed over by Hertz at Planet Hollywood (see my other review, they take reservations for cars they don't have and don't let you know until you actually need the car), I found myself in need of a convertible to go cruise the Valley of Fire.\n\nI looked on-line and found that Beverly Hills had several  comparable cars to choose from and for a cheaper price.\n\nI made a reservation on-line and swung over to their shop. Due to the short nature of my reservation they didn't have the requested car cleaned up and ready to go. While I was more than okay with waiting for the car requested, Susan went above an beyond and provided us with an arguably nicer car for less money and waived the requirement to fill the tank back up.\n\nSuper impressed with these guys, will definitely go to them first for my rental needs next time.
