I love Dr. Timothy Peace! Me and my family have gone to him for years! He is very careing, takes a lot of time with you and gives us a great price for our family!\n\nHe can usually fit us in within a day or two on short notice for an IV or something, but if were sick, he can get us in immediately.\n\nHe treats us and everybody like family and we are thankful to have someone like him taking care of our family!!\n\nIf you are looking for a great Naturopath that has been doing this for many years and has your best interest at heart go to www.peacewellnesscenter.com and ask for Tim Peace...I won't steer you wrong!!\n\nThank you to Dr. Peace & Peace Wellness Center for many years of helping us!!!\n\nFay
