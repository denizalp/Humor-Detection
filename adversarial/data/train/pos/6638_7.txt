The bartender was pretty clueless last night. During happy hour she spent five minutes stocking the beer cooler with her back to the bar. When she finished did she check to see if anyone needed a drink? No, she checked her phone by the register and sent a text. Only then did she come down the bar to ask for my order.\n\nI asked what was on happy hour and she rattled off a few beers and stopped. I stared at her and asked about cocktails. Only then did she mention the spirits on HH.\n\nI ended up with a margarita which was pretty mediocre.
