After our recent visit to the Sammy's L.A. Pastrami on Decatur, we were told that we need to visit the one on Tropicana.  Of course, this didn't take any persuading for the Husband who had his dinner planned out before he saw me.\n\nThis location is a bit bigger with a few tables inside the walk up counter, tables outside, and of course, their drive through.  Two people worked here when we went - one working the back and the other working the front.\n\nSticking with what they know best - pastrami, the Husband went for the Pastrami Burger \"A 1\/4 lb burger topped with Sammy's famous pastrami, mustard, pickle & provolone.\" ($7.59)  He was also convinced to add a fried egg on top as well (99 cents)!  Since having their pastrami sandwich only a week ago, this burger is big but not quite as big as the sandwich.  But then again, it's loaded with hamburger meat, pastrami, and now a fried egg.  So, it's a serious burger.  He was digging it and ate it all up himself!\n\nI was sticking with their signature fries and again went for the Garlic Romano, this time a large for $4.99.  Their large size is HUGE compared to the medium at the other location. I have no idea why!  We easily finished the medium before, but we didn't stand a chance with the large here.  Yikes!\n\nWe also shared a large Handmade Pomegranate Lemonade ($3.99).  Originally I asked for a frozen lemonade, but the guy working the counter suggested the regular one would be better.\n\nAfter we put in our order, we took a seat outside to enjoy the spring evening and our food soon arrived.  The counter guy also came by to ask how we liked the food and even gave us refills on the lemonade.  Sweet!  He was definitely a friendly one and he knew more about when the place was going to be featured on the Food Network too.\n\nOf course, we didn't finish the fries but the Husband brought them home.  He said they tasted even better the next day after a few minutes in the toaster oven.  Lucky! \n\nThey also have gift certificates available at restaurant.com for this location.
