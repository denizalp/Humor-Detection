I'm a fan!! I love the quick and easy drive thru and the fact that it's open 24 hrs? Amazing! \n\nThe service was friendly and efficient. I tried the kicker, annihilator, caramelizer and the cocomo. I liked how you can make your drink hot, iced or into a frap. My favorite were the annihilator and the cocomo. The annihilator is a chocolate macadamia nut coffee and the cocomo is a coconut flavored one. \n\nThe prices are also affordable with two smalls around $6!
