There are several poor sports bars in the Beaches. Which is why I was really hoping that the new Outrigger Restaurant would be different.\n\nLet's start with the positives.\n\n1) The decor and design is nice. It seems a little classy for what should be it's main clientele - 25-50yr old Beachers who just want affordable food, good service and a chance to get away from the franchise Pubs or dirtier spots. It feels\/looks more like a narrow Keg than anything else. Which is fine\/great. 8.5\/10\n\n2) Food. Not necessarily a positive. The wings are small, cheap, and unenthusiastic. To be honest...we only tried apps...not the mains. We had the app platter and calamari and wings and fries and the dip. Overall the food wasn't off-putting. I'd give the food a 6\/10. \n\nNow the negatives.\n\n1) You have multiple large high end TV's surrounding your long bar and front sitting areas. You're in the Beach. For those reasons alone....you better play the Leafs games. I avoid other Beach sports pubs because of poor service or food or whatever....so when I come to your place and see the TV's and the bar and the clientele....I expect the Leafs Game! Do yourself a favor and get Leafs TV so that you don't lose business you could be stealing from other places. It's a small expense. \n\n2) SERVICE. They don't care at all. The beer looked flat. The bartender knew it but made me \"test\" it. Yup. Flat. The other beer keg was empty. They spent 10min just trying to get me a beer. I ordered a side of fries with the wings. \"They actually come with the wings\" Great. Wings took FOREVER to arrive. 20min later...wings come....no fries. Still no beer. I'm half way thru the wings when I can finally get the attention of my server (most of them we're too busy bickering about some internal politics\/conflict within the establishment). No I don't want the fries now. I'll take a gin\/tonic instead. That takes 5min. Meanwhile, there's some dirty looks and attitude from most of the employees.\n\nI voiced my concerns to the head bartender\/waitress. No Leafs, no fries, no beer, no service, no apology. I asked for the bill. She ran around for ANOTHER 5min trying to find the manager. She finally gets the owner\/manager (50yr old east-indian woman), takes her aside and explains what has occurred. The manager looks very stern, shakes her head.\n\nI get the bill. Of course...no complements from the owner\/manager. I look over to the owner\/manager. She stares me down...like I did something wrong. I get a dirty look from her and then she walks away. Not a word to me. THAT IS THE DEFINITION OF BAD SERVICE....when you get a chance to make something right (several chances) and then you don't. It just shows that YOU DON'T CARE.\n\nMAYBE I'll go back next year (I like to give bad places a chance to change).\n\nOverall the service just left a horrible feeling for me and my partner.
