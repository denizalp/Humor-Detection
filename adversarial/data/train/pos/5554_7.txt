First off, I wanna say thank you to Lindsey for putting together such a fun event! We sadly had to cancel last minute for the last one because we had family obligations, but I'm SO glad we got to make this one!\n\nShort Leash Dogs was in the house serving up yummy deliciousness. They have a standard menu or you can make your own. There are so many choices! Different types of \"dogs\", a plethora of toppings...holy Moses!\n\nFilm Bar has a number of beers on tap and a few wines as well. I was looking for a white since it was so hot out but alas I could not find one sweet enough for my palate. BUT I did find a Pinot Noir that was light and fruity = happiness!\n\nI loved the mystery of not finding out what movie is playing until it starts. I guess Lindsey did it different this time and had a \"quiz\" with hints to see who could figure out what movie it would be. So much fun! The movie this month was Raising Arizona. I had never seen it before nor even knew what it was about but it turned out to be really funny! 80's funny, but still funny :-P \n\nI can't wait to come to the next event! (Hopefully )
