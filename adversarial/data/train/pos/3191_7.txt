I crowned Lucky's in Tremont \"best brunch in Cleveland\" when I reviewed it a few years ago. At risk of starting a sibling rivalry, I'm changing my vote to Vine & Bean (both are run by Heather Haviland.)\n\nI'm in love with this place, foibles and all.\n\nThe space is charming and cozy. It's an old Victorian house that has been renovated to serve as a restaurant. The fireplace warms in the winter and the spacious outdoor patio and garden delights in the warmer months.\n\nThe food is comforting and delicious. Most excitingly for this Michael Pollan fan, they source produce locally (when possible) and meats that are raised humanely. I love the Canoewreck, Shipwreck, Breakfast Burritos, Granola, Reuben, and the waffles. First timers must not miss the pecan bacon (I like to share an order with the table.)\n\nThe people are very sweet. Their passion for the philosophy of the restaurant is evident. I always feel welcome and that my support is appreciated.\n\nThere are some foibles; no one's perfect, right? I wouldn't suggest coming here if you're in a rush. While the service is always friendly, it can be slow. Just relax and enjoy.  They also are not extremely flexible when it comes to substitutions. In part, this is due to their limited kitchen space. \n\nThey offer dinner, too, that I've been meaning to try. Live music is on Friday and Saturday.
