Mary Coyle is some pretty good ice cream. i would write a longer review, but the history has been covered, and the atmosphere. \n\ni would like this place more, but purchasing ice cream to go afew times i have noticed i need to let it thaw for a month before i can actually eat it. it's frozen that hard. other then that this place is pretty cool. :P
