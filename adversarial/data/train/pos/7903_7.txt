This Dollarama is one of the better ones I've been to. Like many Dollarama stores, products range in price from $1 to a few dollars. At this location conveniently located close to public transit, they have a great selection of gift bags, writing implements, toys, books, housewares and snacks. The greeting cards in particular are $1 each and the quality of the cards (card stock, design and messages) is actually pretty comparable to what you'd find at say Walmart.  I was surprised to see they carry cartons of soy and almond milk. I also came across Maltesers chocolate (which I enjoy) shaped like a reindeer. Stocking stuffer ideas anyone?\n\nWhat I found odd was that a box of 24 patterned cupcake liners cost $2, which is more expensive than each of the greeting cards (some of which I would have paid $3 or more elsewhere). Oh well...the price one pays to have pretty baked goods.\n\nThe staff were courteous and helpful. Like many Dollarama stores now, I was able to pay by credit card. Unfortunately this location is far from where I live but if i find myself in the area, I'd definitely consider coming back.
