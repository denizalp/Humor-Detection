My 24 hours in Vegas ended with getting some breakfast here to take on the road. Calling in to make an order was a little confusing in the beginning. We called the first time to see if we can phone in an order and the lady said yes. The second time we called to actually give them an order another lady said we would have to come in and order at the bar. Then the third time I asked to be transferred to the bar and finally we were able to make our order. \n\nSo side note: If you call and want to place an order to go, just ask to be transferred to the bar.  \n\nWhen we got there our order was already waiting for us. Unfortunately it wasn't correct. I ordered the Bananas Foster Waffle but all I got was a plain waffle. I let the bartender, Robert, know and he was on it. He was shocked and embarrassed that the order wasn't correct. His actual words were, \"This ain't Denny's!\" This guy was awesome! He offered us free mimosas while we waited. Who are we to decline free drinks?!\n\nThe bananas and sauce came out before we were halfway done with our mimosas. So we downed those things and were on our way. \n\nI think my waffle would have been quite delicious if it was fresh out of the kitchen. A bad part on me to order something like that to go. I did like how the waffle itself was fluffy too bad the crisp outside wasn't there anymore. However I did love the foster sauce! The brown sugar, butter, vanilla and cinnamon were well balanced. Very subtle sweetness that went well with the bananas.\n\nMy sister ordered the eggs benedict and while it wasn't the best we had it was still pretty darned tasty. The eggs were cooked perfectly the hollandaise sauce was a little watery to me but still flavorful.\n\nFood was pretty good but Robert's friendliness and attempt to please us stood out the most for me. People were eating at the bar too so if you don't want to wait for a table the bar is great. Especially if Robert's the bartender.
