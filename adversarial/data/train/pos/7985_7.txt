My relatives come stay here a couple of times a year and I'm always invited to stay with them....free vacation! The beds are nice and comfortable but not as comfy as the beds at the Bellagio. I can still fall asleep pretty fast on them though. Everything in the room is controlled by a universal remote. My little cousin is the master of controlling it so I've never tried it. She loves pushing all the buttons especially the ones for the curtains. \n\nI love the scented aroma that Aria pumps through their vents. It gives you a energized but relaxed feeling. One thing it doesn't do is make me want to play their machines. I try to avoid it like the plague I'd rather hang out with my little cousin then play on those money grubber machines. It's tough playing ten rounds of hide and seek in the room ...there is only so many places one can hide! \n\nI eventually end up on the slots every time because my aunt says I'm her good luck charm. I'm glad someone gets lucky here because I don't. I usually last 30 min with $40.00 worth of slot play. If you play a lot here it is best to join the Player's Club because my aunt always gets comped rooms and this last time she had comped tickets to see the Elvis Cirque show.
