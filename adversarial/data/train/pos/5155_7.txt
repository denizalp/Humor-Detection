Another food outing with my OG Ryan B and we decided breakfast for lunch was the way to go. We arrived around 12:45 and they weren't busy at all, which is always a plus when I have time constraints. \n\nService was friendly and our food came out at lightning speed. I got the avocado and bacon omelette with wheat toast and cottage cheese. I ordered the cottage cheese since I really don't like the potatoes they are famous for but I was a little disappointed to find out that they put that same paprika or whatever it is on the cottage cheese so I'll have to make sure I tell them to skip the seasoning on my next visit. The omelette was good albeit a little too much cheese was added for my personal taste. Another thing I'll have to be a little more careful with how I order my meal for the next time. \n\nOverall our meal was good and very basic for a breakfast.
