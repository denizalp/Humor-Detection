I think I am spoiled by all these dumpling places uptown in Scarborough... \n\nDumpling House Restaurant is really not up to the standard when compare to them..\n\nSteamed Dumplings?? If it is supposed to be steamed why were they boiled??  (-0.5 star) The reason I love my dumpling steamed because this cooking method preserved all the taste inside the dumplings and when you bite into one, the soup inside just exposed and your mouth will be filled with flavours!\n\nThe pan fried ones were dripped with oil... my chopsticks were all slippery...\n\nGreen Onion pancakes ($3.99)  just tasted bland, oily and lack any green onion taste.. just doughy and oily!!\n\nPrice wise, it is more expensive than the dumpling places uptown, but I do understand that rent and operating cost is more downtown.. but at least work on making the dumplings better.. \n\nThe owner was really nice and accommodating.. but I don't think I will be back here for dumplings!
