Countless times I have walked past Optiko, glancing from a distance. Without much attention I've passed it off as a fancy technology retailer, car dealership, and swarvoski store. Every detail in this store is illuminated. Even the floor is glittery. Backwalls and displays are lit with blue and purple lights. Too rich for my blood, I thought. It wasn't until I was actually looking for an optical place, I walked into Optiko.\nBrowsing around, I found a good selection of brand name eyewear. They carry Chrome Hearts (which is pretty ballin since there's less than a handful of places that do). They  don't carry the usual selection of brands other optical places carry. An honorable mention, is the amount of unique designer peices they stock. I can't say many places carry the wood frame Ray Bans or the Cat eye Prada frames. Simply put, most stores won't carry them for fear of them not being able to sell. What does this mean for Calgary shoppers? Limited selection, limited choices and boring standard products.\n\nThe eclectic, the unique and fashionable live here. Optiko breaks the mold for the safe and standard. Kudos for having the best selectiof of upscale designer products and ever friendly staff. I had a really good time shopping here.\n\nReview #9 of Yelp's 30 Day Challenge 2012
