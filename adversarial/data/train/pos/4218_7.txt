Two weeks ago marked my second stay at the Cosmopolitan. My first trip involved a 36th floor upgrade to a balcony suite overlooking the Bellagio fountains. Needless to say, I spent the evening on my furnished terrace, chugging a bottle of wine and giddy like a school girl at the prospect of a quarter of an hourly water show. \n\nSo, when I returned this last time on a work trip, I casually mentioned to the front desk clerk how boss that suite was. \"You liked it?\" he asked. I nodded. \"Let me see what I can do for you.\" And do for me he did. Except this time, he put me two floors from the top (56? 54? 52? I can't remember, but it was definitely two floors from the top), in a one bedroom suite with an even more killer view. Hooooboy, it was epic. \n\nWine was had, photos were taken, every person I knew was invited over to imbibe. \n\nI guess I should talk about the room: the Cosmo is decorated beautifully, very modern but comfy. Very clean. The walk in shower room with Japanese soaking tub is to die for. The beds are comfy. The patio furniture is great, too.\n\nI got a club sandwich from room service that was pretty much a delight, too. \n\nBut that view. Seriously.
