Just say NO and do not call them if you are a elderly person. My parents called \"YES\" for there yearly whole home plumbing inspection. When they showed me what they recommened that needed servicing and what they were charging  I got really angry.\n Let's start with installing a new garbage disposal-Labor is $98 a hour at 3 hours ($294). If it takes a licensed plumber 3 hours to install one they must be blind. If they were to buy the garbage disposal from YES and have them install the price would be ($480)   Seriously a new disposal is under $100 at HD.\nTo rebuild the toilet tank is ($249) you can buy a new one at Home depot cheaper. \nTo install a shut-off valve at the toilet ($196) that is just a $1 compression fitting at the hardware store.\nI tried calling them to get a price on the labor to install a garbage disposal to see if they are consistent in ripping people off, but the girl could not give me a price over the phone and said a technician would have to come to my home because only they have the prices-yea right.\nI just wonder how many other elderly people are trusting these companies, only to be taken advantaged of. \nShame on you YES plumbing.
