Love this bar!\n\nDRINK: This is a great bar to go to late nights or during sports games to just chill and drink. Offer all the basic alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks.\n\nFOOD: The food here tastes ten times better than what it looks like. I was hesitant to order food, but I'm glad I did. I highly recommend the beef sliders to everyone. The meat is very moist, tasty grilled onions is included, and the bun has the perfect texture. They have very good pizza on their menu. The shrimp scampi is made to perfection and has a large portion.\n\nATMOSPHERE: It looks like any other bar, but the customers and workers make this place fun. The bar tender and chef were super friendly. Great place to go to on a Saturday night:)
