I'm glad Yelp agrees that this place is terrible!  I have never had a worse clubbing experience than this.  And I come from Vancouver--clubs here in general are ridiculous but that's not what my review is about. \n\nThe club promoters had given us wrist bands that are supposed to get ladies in to the front of the line, no wait, before midnight and open bar for $10 cover.  Okay, $10,  not so bad.  But we waited in line for about 30-45 minutes!! And then we get to the bar and wait another HOUR and FIFTEEN minutes! And by the time the bartender gets to us, it's past midnight and the free drinks promotion is over. So we pay $12 for a watery drink, try to dance a bit but keep getting hit by other people who can't control their limbs. And finally we decided to leave after 20 mins on the dance floor.  Terrible, terrible club. WTF? Ridiculous!
