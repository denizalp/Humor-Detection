I wasn't too impressed with the Bellagio Buffet.  Granted, I haven't been there in 15 years or so, but I was expecting much more when we recently visited.\nThere was about a 20 minute wait to be seated.  Once you pay ($30pp for lunch + tip) you are led to a table in the cavernous dining room.  You serve yourself drinks from a Coke freestyle machine or juice fountains.  There are several different types of cuisine with some inspiration from the Bellagio restaurants.  One thing you should try is the Hawaiian ice cream - refreshing and delicious! Sadly, the rest of food was average and lacked any originality.  Nothing stood out as noteworthy and I regret not just going to a brunch restaurant.  I am not even sure if this buffet would compare well to similar Vegas buffets.  \nMaybe Bellagio's buffet was better back in the day, or maybe my expectations have been raised over the years...but this is not the meal i remember!
