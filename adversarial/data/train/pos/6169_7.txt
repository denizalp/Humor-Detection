I've seen several Cirque du Soleil shows in the past:   Mystere at the Treasure Island, Corteo in San Francisco, and Zumanity at New York New York.   Without calling myself an habitue, I certainly know enough about the Cirque du Soleil to know what to expect.\n\nUntil now, that is.    Even though this does have some elements of the Cirque du Soleil, acrobatics don't feature as heavily in Love.  Nevertheless, the show was stunning and fabulous and the set design eclipsed anything I've seen until now.\n\nSet to The Beatles' Love soundtrack by George & Giles, the show is immensely entertaining.    I haven't really touched hallucinogenic drugs in 15 years and yet, this show seriously made me long for some lysergic acid diethylamide or some mushroom caps.  Anything, really, to accompany the sensory overload of colors, music, touch...Cirque du Soleil did a fabulous job and this show was by far my favorite (albeit not the most amazing) Cirque show I've seen!\n\nOh, and the acrobatic hippies bouncing up and down during \"Revolution\" had me laughing my ass off...   Look, I lived in Berkeley between 89 and 93, and the most exercise most hippies get is reaching for the bong, ok?   These guys were doing flips on and off the phone booth... HILARIOUS!\n\nIf you love beautiful set designs and enjoy the Beatles music, you're gonna love it!  I promise!
