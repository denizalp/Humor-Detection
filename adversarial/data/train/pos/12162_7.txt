I am not from Montreal but i have seen the reviews and they weren't so pleasant. I had some suspicion about this restaurant but it was a long day and my mother and i were very hungry and wanted a good early dinner. the outside doesn't seem like it was the best place to eat and once you walked in they had barely any customers. We were greeted by the waiter who seated us very quickly, handed us the menu.. He seemed nice and notice we were Americans and told us if we had any question to just ask. Once we looking over the selection two very strange guys came into the restaurant and i could immediately tell they were on drugs. i think the other people in the restaurant could tell also. Once our waiter seen the worried looks on me and my mothers face he made sure they we would have a pleasant time and catered to us. I ordered the Carbonara ( w\/ bacon)  which by some reviews a lot of people didn't enjoy and my mother had Festin Italien ( Spaghetti w\/ meatball , sausage and Cheese bread). I enjoyed the Carbonara, it was so delicious, My mother enjoyed her food as well. Even thou those strange people were around us i can't say that it wasn't a good meal. The staff were very professional and handle the situation very well and catered to me and my mother and very well. Hopefully people give this restaurant another chance i believe they deserve it.
