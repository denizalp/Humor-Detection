Free WiFi in Vegas?  Excellent.\nSolid food options, unlike pretty much any other airport.\nPeople mover or walkways.\nGreat baggage claim.\nEfficient, artistic, and even slot machines.\nI love the self contained smoking stations too.....like a bunch of people sealing themselves in a coffin to inhale something deadly....perfect.
