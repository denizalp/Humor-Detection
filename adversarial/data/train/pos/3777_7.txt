I greatly dislike to leave negative comments but the food was tasteless and very poor looking,  the service was great (our server) very attentive and helpful,  when the manager came to our table he seemed incredibly nervous and just stood there looking at us (very uncomfortable) I could not hear him speak either and it was awkward, you could tell he had no interest or he did not care. Our prior visit I had really enjoyed our food, I ordered the same and regretted it. We left very disappointed.  Unfortunately I can't see us coming back.
