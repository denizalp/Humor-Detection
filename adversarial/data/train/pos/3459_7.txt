The Apple Dumpling claims to hold the world record for most Apple Dumplings served.  Well - maybe not - but they have served like 200,000 - and that says a lot considering that this restaurant is literally in the country - on a highway - not near any major exit from an interstate.\n\nBest Fried Chicken in town. Period!
