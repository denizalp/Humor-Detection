What time is it? It's update time! \n\nAnd we're talking clog-my-arteries-but-I-don't-care pub fare. \n\nAfter a busy day of exploring the Metroparks, plus a stop at Whitey's next door, we needed some sustenance. Beer!\n\nWell, not *just* beer. Some apps, too! Heavenly, creamy, cheesy artichoke dip and soft pretzels to be exact. While I indulged (aka scarfed) what tasted like a jalepeno and cheese stuffed pretzel, I could feel the calories I just burned hiking coming on back. But hey, it was worth it. And what do they put in artichoke dip, anyways? Addictive drugs? I couldn't stop eating this stuff even though I *knew* it wasn't good for me.  \n\nThe beer is darn tasty, but that's just my opinion. We really wanted to try the Seven IPA. Turns out everyone else did too, so they were out. We ended up with the Grindstone Gold, which also had nice hoppiness.\n\nSo, yeah--I still love me some Cornerstone. It wasn't just a college phase. And after reading Sarah V's review, it sounds like I should go back and try to eat a healthy, turkey salad instead. Errr...try to, at least.
