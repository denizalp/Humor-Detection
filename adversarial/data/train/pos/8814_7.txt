The Jack Layton ferry terminal hosts daily ferry rides to Centre Island, Wards Island and Hanland Point. The ferry to Centre Island is definitely more packed, but these islands are connected - so feel free to hop aboard any of them to get to any of these islands. Of course, there are other ferries - such as speedboats that are slightly more expensive, but definitely more fun when you're getting to these islands. Prices for ferries are $8-$9 for a round trip if you get a day trip. Tip: If you would like to skip the lines, especially in those gorgeous summer days, I would advise to purchase your tickets in advance.\n\nCentre Island is roughly a 10 minute boat ride away. When you arrive, you can find washrooms immediately to your right. If you would like to enjoy the rest of the island, please follow the paths on your left. The best photo spot in my opinion is the path to your left RIGHT where the water is. There is a paid eye piece zoom viewing device that captures the best photo spot.\n\nCentre Island is home to many different activities such as bike riding (tandem, bike riding as a family of 6+, Centreville amusement rides for young children and adults, kayaking, etc.) In addition, there are beautiful beaches that you can enjoy when the weather is nice and warm.\n\nFood prices on CentreIsland are limited (pizza being the most popular place) and more expensive than in other parts of the city. If you would like to save money on food, I would recommend bringing a picnic to enjoy!
