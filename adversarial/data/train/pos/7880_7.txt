I'm not going to lie; I wanted to go to this Denny's solely because of Jetta R.'s review.\n\nBad, bad, bad.  Bad service, bad food, bad experience.  I took my friend here twice to make sure that the first time wasn't just a fluke.  Our waitress was a total space cadet and was completely uninterested in us.  I realize Denny's isn't a high class restaurant, but I do subscribe to the belief that your water glass should never be empty.  We put our glasses at the end of the table.  The waitress flitted around at the tables behind us (there were two, maybe three other tables occupied when we visited, tops), but didn't cater to our needs.  She treated us like children on both visits.  I told my friend, \"the tip meter is running.\"\n\nI wanted to like Jenny's, but it just sucked.  There's no reason for crappy service with a place as empty as it was.
