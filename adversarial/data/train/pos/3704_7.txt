The high reviews are warranted.  The happy hour is fantastic - all manner of fried things and delicious caipirinhas for next to nothing (and you can eat anywhere - you aren't put in \"bar time-out\" in uncomfortable chairs).   \n\nThe apps were delicious and I look forward to returning for a meal-meal.
