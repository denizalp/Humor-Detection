*** Review is for Spring Restaurant Week 2014 menu ***\n\nTable 10 only offers a lunch option during Restaurant Week but this is a good way to try a place.  For the first course, I went with the chicken and Andouille sausage gumbo.  This is Emeril's place so why go with a salad.  The gumbo also had steamed rice in it and my server added freshly ground pepper to my liking.  When I first tasted the gumbo, I thought that it needed something more to kick it up a notch.  I almost asked for some hot sauce but I thought that might be like asking for a salt shaker at JoÃ«l Robuchon.  As I ate the gumbo, the spiciness started to kick in.  The spice was there.  It showed itself fully as you ate more of the gumbo.\n\nFor the main course, I chose the the pea tortellini.  This menu describes it as sweet pea tortellini with handmade pasta, pea shoots, Romano cheese, mascarpone and lemon oil.  It was really a flavorful dish and just the right amount for lunch considering dessert was yet to come.\n\nFor dessert, you can choose any of the desserts on the menu.  I went with the specialty of the house, the banana cream pie.  It was excellent.  A tall slice of goodness with layers of large, whole chucks of banana with seams of cream.  It's like a block wall of banana with cream holding the blocks in place.  It was excellent!\n\nService was good.  There weren't a whole lot of people here, but it appeared like one server was covering the lunch crowd except for the people sitting at the bar.\n\nA solid Restaurant Week selection!
