Gorgeous interior with plenty of attention to detail: white woods, open spaces, hammered silver cutlery, and pretty floral bread and dessert plates that matches the wallpaper in the bathroom hallway (so gaudy it's great). I liked how everything came together decoratively, and the service was correspondingly professional and attentive.\n\nSimple but solid steakhouse menu, everything was executed well: standard assortment of apps, selection of steaks and seafood, vegetarian options available. Beef tartare and roasted beet appetizers were predictable and a little underwhelming. Steak and lobster tail special ($65) was good quality with a surprisingly savory house steak sauce. Brussels sprouts and branzino (ask for extra chimmi churri) were typical and the oft-hyped mac and cheese waffle was a fun textural twist on the usual version (make sure you get the cheese sauce!), but the dessert was the surprise highlight: definitely get the peanut butter pretzel cheesecake! \n\nOverall, the food was good but not great. Andiron met my expectations for a good dinner, but knowing that this spot was voted the best new restaurant in Vegas for 2015 (even if it is largely a popularity a contest), I expected to be wowed... but wasn't.\n\nEDIT: Dropping a star. Returned for brunch and service was largely absent. Our trio ordered several dishes to share and most were unremarkable. The shrimp and grits dish I ordered was pretty but barely seemed seasoned and the $10 avocado toast was flat-out boring. The dessert bar was a nice touch, but not enough to justify the prices for the quality put out for paid dishes.
