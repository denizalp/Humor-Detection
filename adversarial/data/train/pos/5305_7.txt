Definitely not your A-List class of shopping malls.  Even the line up of anchor stores and all the other small stores housed within trend towards middle America.  So if you are expecting valet attendants to park your car, complimentary bubblies and small living room size changing rooms to try on your outfits, this is more than likely not the mall or the stores you will be shopping at.\n\nWhat is good about shopping here, on the occasions that I do come by here is the ample amount of parking spaces in the vast parking lots (except Christmas shopping season - but even then you can find spaces that is a little further from the door).  And if you are looking to shop for gifts at some of the mainstream national chains, they have most of them plus a little more of everything else.\n\nThe Body Shop.  (Yep)\nBath & Body Works  (Bubbles)\nVictoria's Secret  (Angels!)\nThings Remembered  (Sudoku!)\nSephora  (Stiff stiff)\nFrederick's of Hollywood  (Hubba hubba)\n\nThey have your typical mall food court, but again very run of the mill overall.  It will do in a pinch, just not interesting enough to warrant any major detours for.\n\nWith the exception of redeeming a Groupon or gift card, there is no major compelling reason for shopping here above all the other shopping points of interest around town.  Except for the residents that live in the NW.  But a few more minutes on the freeway and you have a lot more options.\n\nAnyway, it definitely looks better on the outside than what you could typically find on the inside.
