The Bellagio is always a must-stop when I have guests in town who are dying to go see the sights.  You can valet either at the front lobby or off of Flamingo near the shops but if you're walking you'll be sure to enjoy one of Las Vegas' main attractions...the fountains! Gorgeous at night spectacular during the day-its a free show to see and enjoy before you even walk in the door.\n\nBellagio is one of my favorite hotel\/casinos on the strip. It's so beautiful inside but my goodness it's always crowded.  \n\nYou'll be greeted by a spectacular hand-blown glass chandelier. A sculpted massive arrangement of flowers adorn the ceiling and you'll see camera's flashing before your eyes since everyone will be \"blown\" away by its beauty.\n\nA fabulous little lobby bar where you can rest your tired feet is always a favorite. I remember having cocktails there with my in-laws but since \"dad\" is no longer with us, every time I pass by I remember the time we enjoyed some great martinis!\n\nWhen he was here we also went to see the amazing popular \"O\".  A water-trapeze spectacle show which is shown year-round.\n\nFor my anniversary I had dinner at Olives-where the food is amazing but the hostess who didn't sit us outside on our special day gets a big BOO! \n\nThe nightclub I've heard is wonderful but years ago we enjoyed drinks and live music there with a great balcony water view.  Not sure if you have that option now, but on that occasion when you just want a nice view and a drink -this was the place to go.\n\nThe buffet can be hit or miss but for me it was a miss.  It's not my favorite on the strip but for some it could be enjoyable.\n\nThe main restaurant that serves breakfast, lunch and dinner was also a fail-sadly the food and service was not that great.\n\nI've visited the museum which hosts various art exhibitions including exceptional historic artists, so if you're in town check out the Fine Art Museum so you don't miss your favorite collection.\n\nThe casino is beautiful and full of action, I don't play the tables much so me and my guests usually have fun at the slots but always walk away winners.\n\nShopping shouldn't be missed even if you're just \"Looky-Looing\".  Pop in the Chanel store and buy yourself at least a little bottle of perfume, you'll at least smell like a high-roller.\n\nThe conservatory shouldn't be missed. Every season they change it up and you'll find huge fun displays made of flowers!\n\nThe spa, the rooms and some high-end restaurants are still on my list to try so I will definitely be back.
