Several years ago, I stopped at Lilly's to get take out but in those days they closed between lunch and dinner.  Having dropped a friend off at home, this was a nearby choice to get some Thai food--something I've been neglecting recently.\n\nThe restaurant is a small space in a strip mall in the Von's plaza on DI.  I was told I could sit wherever I wanted, and I was brought water and the Thai iced coffee I ordered for this hot day.\n\nLooking over the menu, I stopped when I came to the duck selections.  It was simply a matter of choosing which one.  I opted for the Ka pao duck which is boneless, roasted duck topped with a spicy basil sauce.  I was asked how spicy I wanted my dish.  On a scale of 1 to 10, I chose 7.  The server questioned whether I liked spicy foods and told me that they use fresh Thai spices.  I stuck with the 7.\n\nAfter a reasonable amount of time, my dinner was brought and it smelled really good.  That matched the way it tasted too.  I would get a spice level of 8 another time but the 7 was good.\n\nI was asked if I wanted chopsticks or silverware.  I opted for silverware because I don't eat Thai food with chopsticks.\n\nService was good.  I need to return to try some Vietnamese food they have and see how it stacks up against other Vietnamese palces.  There are also a number of duck dishes to get too.
