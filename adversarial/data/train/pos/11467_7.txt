I got my new 2016 GTI back in November from this dealership. My overall experience from sales, finance to service staff has been just awful. \n\nPros \n- Location \n\n\nCons  \n- They cannot communicate \n\n- Not knowledgeable about their cars \n\n- Shady finance managers (Although I told him I do not want ANY extra things added to my car he ended up screwing me and added \"Paint and interior protection package\" under a different fee so I won't catch it while signing the documents.) I retuned and asked them about the issue and they told me its mandatory which is BS. I also randomly asked another salesman about it . Even he smiled, saying he has never seen that before. \n\n- Sloppy Detail \/ staff  ( When I picked the car up after the package had been applied, I noticed they completely trashed my interior. The oily solution they used for the dash was also all over the trim panels, touch screen, fabrics and even the steering wheel ! Any detailer knows not to add any slippery solution to the steering wheel due to safety reasons. The manager told me its normal. I ended up spending hours undoing everything they did to my car. \n\n- They ignore you (When I went in to make an appointment they told me they won't be able to  and asked me to call. I went to my car and called VW using their Car net service to schedule my appointment but they again transferred me back to the dealership to schedule it. I spoke with Kyle and after letting him know the problem with my brand new car, he unenthusiastically told me that he will call me back when the VW loaner is available. He only asked for my name so before he hung up I had to remind him to take my phone number. Its been a week and 1 additional email, I STILL have not received any response. \n\nIn the end, I wont recommend this dealership to anyone. Its a shame... because 1) They are located across the street from me, and 2) I have had great experiences at chapman BMW before but based on my experience at this dealership i'll make sure to never come back and take my business to Lunde VW in Peoria that is 40 mins way from me. \n\nHopefully this review is a wake up call for this dealership to get its act together because this business model will not be sustainable for much longer.
