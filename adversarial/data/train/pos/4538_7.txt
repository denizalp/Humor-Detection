I Want my money back\n\nI got a turkey sub that included the additional cost of cheese. Fine but they put shredded cheddar no American slices. I was offered provolone and motz. I asked for mayo, onion, lettuce, banana pepper. They don't have banana peppers. They DO have \"hot peppers\" so I ordered those. I found them on the menu myself. Canned jalape√±o and pepperoncini is what the \"hot peppers\" consisted of. And the cheese was stale!! The shredded cheddar!! If you don't want to make subs then don't put them on the menu!! \n\nI was also watching the waitress have a hard time entering my order into the POS system. She said \"I have to type a paragraph\" I didn't know if she was mad or not. Sorry the sub only comes with bread meat lettuce and tomato. No mayo! No cheese! Nothing else, so yeah people are going to alter their order because wtf kind of sub is that? I'm from buffalo and I seriously don't know how they could sell a sub like this. Also I've worked at Jim's steakout for several years when I was 16-20 and had no problems with using a cash register POS. \n\nback to the nasty sub I got...\nThey didn't cut the sub in half and it was seriously worse than subway. I'm not even eating it. I want to go back in and return it but the girls are busy (6-7 tables, 2 servers, 1 food runner) and I don't want to get yelled at. I waited 22 mins and paid $13 with a pop for this crap and I want my money back. I really don't even think the full sub is 12\" it looks more like 9 or 10. \n\nPizza at this location is ok but arville overall is much better food wise. I've had a chicken finger sub from the other location and pizza that was good. \n\nOne star for the pizza which if I was you I'd order from Arville instead. Good-Luck
