Wow! Hard to figure out how I feel about this place!\n\n(This is the location across from Fry's by Riggs & McQueen-apparently there was an unrelated Bliss salon somewhere else in Chandler that is now closed for good.)\n\nSuper comfortable massage chairs for pedicures, clean environment, recent magazines, friendly staff, no waiting, easy access parking. \nI would give this place a 5 star rating if only.....\n* If the technician did not scrub my feet so hard that they bled for days.\n* If the technician did not actually slice open my right big toe with all of her scrubbing\n* If I did not have to call the police for the employees b\/c they had language barrier issues and wanted to call the police because there was some belligerent lady there with a gift certificate for another salon called Bliss and insisted she could use it here. Of course this was after she had a pedicure and her manicure was almost finished. She refused to pay and started screaming at the staff and getting very rude with them because they were struggling to communicate with her.\n* In all fairness, I could have let my technician know that I was in pain but I wasn't noticing b\/c of all the drama going on.\n--I will give this place another try because I am a glutton for punishment (I do teach Junior High, after all) and because I believe everyone deserves a second chance.
