This place has a nice vibe and ambiance to it. I was with a big group and our waitress was really good and able to handle everyone.\n\nI ordered the chicken wings and fries because I wanted to keep it light and simple. Needless to say, my food was far from simple. I just wanted some regular wings and they were a bit on the fancy side. Maybe I was thinking of  a BBW or Hooters (something along those line. Any who, they came with a smokey bbq sauce that wasn't that good. I ended up asking for some ranch dressing and that pretty much enhanced the wings. \n\nThe fries were a totally different story! Again, I just wanted some regular fries. I guess these were baked in the oven which was fine. However, they looked almost \"well done\" and some were soggy and others were crunchy. I dipped them in my ranch sauce too (that's how good the ranch was). After eating, I got my bill and these nasty fries were $5!!!!!! That's the most that I've ever paid for just some fries, even when I've gone to a regular restaurant. \n\nOverall, it was a nice restaurant despite my rant over the meal. It was definitely not what I expected, but I would try this place again. Next time I will order something different off of the menu. I also liked the fact that we didn't have to ask for refills on water. The waiter automatically came to our table with pitchers of water. One of the other guest I was with had the french toast and it looked really good! Also, it's good that they have tv's all around for us sports fans.
