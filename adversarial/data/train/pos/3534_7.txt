We usually end up here for a late lunch. The menu has changed a little bit, but most of the expensive burgers and salads remain. The beer list is decent but leans towards the mainstream. Once you get over the fact that you just shelled out $15 for a burger with Gruyere and caramelized onions and it didn't even come with fries you'll still enjoy the food.\n\nService varies. I've had great servers, and I've had ones that aren't too swift. But the eye candy is great, and there's sports from every angle. The milkshakes with booze are fun, too.
