I get that his place is live on Saturday nights and I get why there's always a line.. but in realitiy.. this ain't Vegas.  Most popular clubs in Seattle.. lines tend to move quick.  The richer areas like Bellevue, the same.. lines tend to move quick.  Scottsdale is comparable to Bellevue (Rich folks.. fancy cars.. etc.). \n\nFrom what I saw the past few weekends (Saturday Nights), the only issue I have is the line.  Go there Saturday night.  Security personal checking your I.D. is that short white dude who thinks he's bad ass.  \"Hey girls.. I'll let you in.. but give me a hug.\" SMH. \n\nOne of the worst experiences.. There goes half the night. \n\nThis place could be awesome if it was bigger and better Security Personal who can check ID's faster.  Maybe Management told Security to check 1 ID every 5 to 10 minutes but that just means.. Management sucks even more. \n\nPeople came to drink and have fun.. not wait in line for an hour just to get to the front of the line and wait another 15 minutes.  Sure I can give the short security guy some money.. but what's the point of free entry.  dafuq? \n\nHi Fi also needs to do a better job of managing the damn line.  People cut which may cause a fight to break out or some to jump over the fence onto the patio.  \n\nI give this place a 1 for wasting my time and wasting my time writing this damn review.  \n\nPeople,\nTry going to Whisky Row.. it's right next door.  Faster.. better looking girls and less crowded.  It's not a bumper to bumper grind on guys ass. Oh!! and the girls dancing on the bar holding a 5th of goose.. they pour you drinks.. but make sure to tip those gals.  the bartenders are way hotter at Whisky Row
