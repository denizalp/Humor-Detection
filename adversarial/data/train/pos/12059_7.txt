After attending the Yelp UYE here, I had to go back and try their 2\/3 lbs full sized burgers. Brought my good friend with me who's a Vegas native and has eaten pretty much everywhere. We;ve done burgers together at BurGR and I love burgers.\n\nStopped in at 5pm, which should be happy hour in most places and it is here, but there was only 2 couples in a booth and just us at the bar. Surprising considering how good the food is. I think it will slowly build up and become a great place.\n\nWe both ordered the Loaded Baked Potato Burger, which comes with everything you'd find on a loaded baked potato. They use Australian hamburger that comes from grass fed cows, all organic. An excerpt from our conversation while eating courtesy of my friend \"Wow, this beef is really good\". Upon exiting in the parking lot, he also said \"we have GOT to come back here\"\n\nI thought the burger was exceptional, for $11. I would come back here time and time again because this is easily the best burger I've had in Vegas, and pretty much anywhere. Sorry BurGR, sorry I love burgers, sorry Bachi Burger....this place rules over you in the Burger World.
