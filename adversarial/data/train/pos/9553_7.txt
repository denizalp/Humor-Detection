Eep!!!! These ladies are miserable people here!!!! Lets hope they are better with animals.....sure not good with people!!!!\n\nIf I could have given a \"zero\" instead of \"one\" rating I would.\n\nLess then impressed with the whole experience from beginning to end.\n\nAfter taking my dog to numerous groomers over the years....they usually say hi when you walk in and approach the counter. Nope, not this place! I said I was here for a grooming appt at 12:15, even though it was 12:07. The girl at the counter \"Haley\" just stared at me and put a sheet down and said since you haven't been here before, you need to fill this out.\n\nOk.\nNot off to a good start but I will give it a chance since its about my dog not me.\n\nWhile I was filling out a sheet, my dog had an accident. Would have been a nice touch while I was filling the sheet out, they took my dog. Guess that is too much to ask for?\n\nAnyway I asked Haley if she had Kleenex or something to wipe it up? She looked at me and went to the back.i am assuming to get something? No idea. In the meantime I used one of my dogs bags to clean up.\n\nA nice touch would be to have wipes at the front counter? I am sure this is not the first time this has happened with a dog?? Oy.\n\nLong story short....they took my dog in. i can pick him up in 2 hours. That is longer then other groomers we have taken our dog, but hey it will work.  He is only 6 pounds so a 2 hour haircut must mean its going to be great? I am sure he will look fabulous???? Let's hope.\n\nFast forward 2 hours and he isn't ready.....the groomer \"Shawna\" says I am early and he will be another 20 mins. If she was polite, I would have let it slide but she wasn't ....actually she is very rude. She starts talking about how she told me 2 hours after I left he would be ready, not 2 hours from my appt. Eep!!! Nothing like getting schooled and spoken too like an idiot! I mumbled something about '\" Guess that will be okay\". She then says something about me being a pain in the butt, but didnt use the word butt and walks off. Wow,is all I can think of at this point. Is this a business or just mean girls??? At this point, who knows? Customer service is really really lacking here.\n\nFunny thing is I arrived at 12:07 and left by 12:14, so it was already 2 hours after I left. My appt was at 12:15, so not sure how returning at 2:15 was early? Maybe she doesn't understand how time works? No idea?\n\nIf she would have take some accountability and for her mistake instead of blaming the customer, this could have been a different experience. She could have easily said \" I am running behind, can you wait 20 minutes?\" I honestly would have been more then happy with that but instead she blamed me and was very rude about it. Maybe she just hates her job or people? Wow, this Shawna is not normal to come off the handle like this over something so basic.\n\nI ask the girl \"Haley\" if I can speak to a manger....she then tells me that the lady who just spoke to me is the manger. I could have fainted. The rude one is the manger??? The one cutting my dogs hair? I get nervous. Eep!!!!\n\nInstead of wandering around the mall, my child and I decide to sit at the counter and wait. No way I'm  leaving my dog with this crazy lady!!!! she doesn't seem all \"there\" and no way should my dog suffer.\n\nI just want to pay and leave!!!!! Help!\n\nFinally at 2:49 my dog is ready. His haircut is okay nothing to get wild about say fantastic!. Didn't look like a teddybear yoki haircut ?Even my child says he is happy he is finally done but doesn't comment on his haircut like he usually does? So I will assume, he isn't a fan of the haircut? Or maybe the service? \n\nGroomer Shawna, walks out puts my dog down and goes to the back. Would have been a great time for an apology or some sort of redemption on her part.Nope. Maybe even hi? Bye? What do you think? Nope. \n\nDrops him on the ground and walks away - great to see she is mean to animals too, not just people!\n\nI pay, $73.50 for the haircut??There is a tip option???? No way I would ever tip this place or Shawna. I just want to get out of here and the amount is crazy but like I said....I just want to get out of here, so I pay !! Quiet and fast is how I like it at this point.\n\nNever will come back EVER!!!!horrible customer service and the value is even worse! They need to evaluate the kind of employees they have since their brand is in jeopardy by these girls running\/working at this place. I was really hoping for a positive experience here but they failed miserably here!!!!! A negative -100 rating is what it really should be.\n\nI also noticed on the way home his nails weren't cut at all? Stopped off at my vets and she cut them. She stated they were defiantly not cut. She also recommended I contact the owner of Paw Spa to tell her about my experience, the BBB and that they really dropped the ball on grooming + service too. I will do that and update my Yelp review with the outcome after speaking with her. Let's hope she is better then her staff!!
