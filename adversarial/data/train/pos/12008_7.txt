HIGHLY RECOMMENDED\n\nNEVER GO TO THE COURTHOUSE AGAIN. \n\nI've used these guys twice. They charged me $50 and cut my fine in half.  Also received no points.  \n\nThe time, and money I have saved well worth it.  I would have had to pay for traffic school etc.  I was able to submit my citation to them via email.  Pay over the phone.  SUPER CONVENIENT!\n\nThanks so so much!
