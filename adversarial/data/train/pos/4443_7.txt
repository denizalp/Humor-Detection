Terrible experience. Sat 20 minutes at the bar waiting for a table. Tried to get the waitress's attention multiple times but I forgot I wore my invisibility cloak apparently because she didn't even look my way. We sat in our booth for another 20 minutes without a waiter even coming by. Then, as a favor to us, another waiter decides to come by and hand us salads (that we didn't order) to tide us over. It was fairly obvious that the salads were made quite a long time ago.\n\nFast-forward to ordering our dinners (no, really, because we sat there for another 15 minutes after our salad bowls were cleared), I ordered the cheese ravioli. Surprise, surprise, waited again for the most mediocre cheese ravioli and flavorless marinara sauce I've ever had. No one in my 5 person group bothered to finish their meal because it just wasn't worth it.\n\nThey don't do split checks, so be warned. But the free house wine was delicious, so there's that.
