Saturday night my wife and I went to Parma for some takeout. \nI ordered the Parma sandwich, and my wife ordered the Anti Pasta. while I'm waiting I told them wow those olives are huge! keep in mind we were not buying any olives. \nwe sat down on comfortable sofas to await our order.\nwhile sitting down, they brought us six of those huge olives, water and a couple slices of prosciutto complimentary of the house! We live here in Las Vegas, and it was the best sandwich I've had anywhere in town my Wife felt the same about her dish. I might add I am very very picky about my sandwiches, and know true Italian sandwiches, this was fantastic. we intend to go back there for their dinners as I've heard so many nice things about their meals. their customer service was outstanding!!!
