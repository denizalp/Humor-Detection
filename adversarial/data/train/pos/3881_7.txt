We recently had to board our dog for the first time.  We researched a couple kennels in the Calgary area and this one was the winner.\n\nThe Kennel is located about an hour east of the city but this shouldn't be a deterrent for using their services - they offer pick-up and drop off at no extra charge! (except that you have to pay for the extra days, I suppose)\n\nSince we had never boarded a dog before, we wanted to go visit the location.  It is located out in the country with large fields and a pond for swimming - there is no traffic for dogs to run into.\n\nShe assured us that the dog would only be in the kennel during meal times, nap time and at night for sleeping.  The rest of the time, the dogs are either outside in size appropriate pens (separated based on dog size\/temperament) or if it's too cold or wet to be outside, Jennifer has a fully heated very large hanger with rubber flooring where they dogs can play inside.\n\nThe dogs are also provided with off-leash walks in the field and pond during the day.\n\nJennifer loves her job and it shows in how she cares for your dog.
