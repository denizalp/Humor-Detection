I've been to BWW on two occasions and they both earned one star. First occassion I went with  my boyfriend and we were meeting up with a couple of friends. My boyfriend orders a beer and hands our waitress his I.D. She then proceeds to tell him that she needs TWO FORMS OF I.D. \"My drivers license isn't good enough?\", he says. \"No.\" responds the waitress. Uhhh, ok. \n\nSecond occasion was tonight 1\/5\/2010. A fundraiser for the Gilbert police officer that was killed in duty. Good cause, right? I figured I'd go with one of my good friends. Man we got the shittiest waitress ever. She has a snotty attitude the entire time and keeps talking to all her dumb  coworkers. Every time she screwed up it was \"Oh, I'm sorry I'm busy.\" Are you freaking joking me? We order our food and some of our friends join us. It takes her almost 30 minutes to bring us dessert which is fried churros and ice cream. I KNOW it doesn't take that long to bring my cold ass churros and melted ice cream to my fucking table. Don't worry.  I didn't tip.\n\nI don't understand people who say ZOMG THESE FUCKIN WINGS ARE SOOOOOO GOOD!!!)$i(!! Because they aren't. They are mediocre at best. NEVER COMING HERE AGAIN.
