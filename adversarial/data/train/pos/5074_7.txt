Was warned not to visit this place because its know among locals to be a tourist trap. Although i had to give into temptation. First off, drinks are WAY over priced. 2 drinks plus a beer, was $50 with tip! WTF!  the girls are 5 out of 10 at best. The one thing that really forced me to give this place a 1 star is that fact that i ask the stripper for a 3 song lap dance which she gave me with pleasure, although decided to charge me for 10. I told her that i only asked for 3 song and wasn't going to pay for the additional  7 songs. Thats when 4 bouncers came and basically told me to pay or they will make me pay. F this place and there bouncers.
