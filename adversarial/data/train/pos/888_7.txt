Ranked as one of the city's finest clubs. The door guys were pretty friendly to my surprise.\n\nRegular cover is $20, on event nights I seen it go all the way up to $80 - if cover is an issue just ask the door man before waiting in line. \n\nBartenders tend to focus more on their cellphones and snapchat stories than making sure people get served. \n\nIf you planning on ballin' out with some friends spending rent money like you still living at your momma's house - Masion Mercer is the place.
