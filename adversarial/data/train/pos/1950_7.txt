This time its gone too far. Below is a copy of the letter that the President of Amex Canada will be receiving this week. They are trying to effect and increase that exceeds 75% and the letter outlines the specious rationale behind such increases.\n\n\"May 31, 2012\n\n\nMr. Howard Grosfield\nPresident and CEO,  Amex Bank of Canada\n101 McNabb Street\n Markham, ON\nL3R 4H8\nCanada\n\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI have just received the \"benefits packet\" regarding the \"enhanced\" American Express Platinum. After a thorough review and analysis I am not very pleased with it.\n\nIt had been my intention to write to you, previous to receiving this mailing, to request a reduction in my Platinum Card annual rate. I recently turned 65 years of age and as such I am no longer eligible for the travel health insurance that the card provided. In pricing out the equivalent insurance (at retail), such a product would cost me now about $180.00\/year. I am sure your company has in the past purchased that coverage and passed it on to me for much less money.\n\nYou have also added Priority Pass to the new package. I had obtained a group recommendation from the same company for a client with 30 employees and they had quoted $169.00 for each employee. This price included a companion for each participant. I am also sure that American Express is able to purchase this product (which openly retails at $299.00) for at least around that price, if not less. In any case, since Priority Pass requires a distinct card that must be applied for and presented it would be extremely easy to \"unbundle\" it for the program. You are able to do so for travel health insurance without a problem.\n\nIn view of the above I do not think that an increase from $399.00 to $699.00 (75%) is at all warranted in any case. More particularly, as it applies to me, this increase is grossly unreasonable.\n\nI am requesting that you reconsider it as I can no longer avail myself of the travel health insurance and do not want a discrete membership in Priority Pass. They do not have the best product and their privacy policies leave a lot to be desired. \nIn any case, for years, American Express has trumpeted their lounge access as a major benefit of the platinum card, so it is difficult to see why an \"enhancement\" such as this is necessary.\n\nThe other enhancements are insignificant and in the case of hotel affinity cards are conditional.  The preferred gold membership is something that any concierge worth his salt in any hotel can easily trump by getting a guest access to virtually any golf course. This particular segment has been extremely hard hit and access is becoming more and more \"open\".\n\nI would have loved to be a fly on the wall when these enhancements were proposed. By the most rudimentary methods of deductions they represent a \"cash lift\" of at least $200.00 for each card holder. In my case you must add the travel health insurance to that amount for a total of $380.00. I am sure that American Express computed the number of \"defecting members\" that this new scheme would cause and concluded that the company would still be ahead. I don't think that anyone ever weighed the impact of members of 65 years of age who no longer \"cost\" the company in travel health insurance....but maybe Amex did weigh the impact and saw the bottom-line contributions enhancements by this group of members.\n\nI formally request that you adjust my upcoming card rate to reflect the fact that I no longer have travel health insurance and exclude me from participation in Priority Pass. This should be reflected by an adjusted and grandfathered rate of less than $399.00 by an amount equal to your cost for the insurance you used to provide.\n\nAs a member since 2001, I look forward to a positive resolution of this matter.\n\nThank you very much for your consideration.\n\nYours truly,\n\n\nAriel Grumberg\"\n\nAnd we are still having the usual problems associated with the poor acceptance of this card in the 905. That next?
