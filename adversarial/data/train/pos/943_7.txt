Sorry and I hate to give Sephora this rating but my experience today left a lot to be desired.\n\nI went to Sephora in search of quite a few items. I'm starting a new job so I wanted to update my makeup stash. I've been existing off of drug store brands for awhile now but my new job requires me to be not just presentable, but polished. So. I wanted to completely revamp my makeup collection. The funny thing is I came here ready to lay down some serious cash but....\n\nThere were PLENTY of employees working here but not one of them greeted me. I walked the aisles, mostly looking at Smashbox and NARS. I wanted a kit and kaboodle type purchase. IE: Concealer, foundation, powder, and a finisher. Unfortunately no employee came around to help me. I even had one girl walk by me, say nothing, and then greet another customer.\n\nAt that point I decided to just go with what I had seen on YouTube videos. I tested concealers\/foundations on the back of my hand until I found a match. Then I wandered to the Clinique section and selected a mascara. I also decides on a new eye-liner by Urban Decay based off of a \"review of eyeliners\" I pulled up while in the store.\n\nI spent a good hour here without ANY help from an employee AND I left with $90 worth of makeup.\n\nHonestly I could have done this kind of shopping online since I did it all myself anyway. Unfortunately there's no way to compare skin tone and foundation online.\n\nSo - my thanks for this makeup rejuvenation mostly goes to makeup artists of YouTube 90% and 10% goes to Sephora for being the place I could go make my purchases.
