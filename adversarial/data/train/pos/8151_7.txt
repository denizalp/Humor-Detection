We were thrilled to see a noodle house in the hotel we were staying at, but were a tad hesitant considering the poor reviews. Keeping an open mind and empty stomachs, we went for it anyway. \n\nWe were sat immediately at the bar because they had no seats available at the time. We were good with that! \n\nWe perused through the menu, and nothing looked or sounded very appetizing. Then, bam! A crispy noodle dish comes out with fresh greens, shrimp and scallops in front of me. Wow! That looked good, but it wasn't in the menu. We kindly asked the waiter and he told us it was in the Chinese menu. What?! Ok, let's see it then. \n\nThat sucker was $25! But we were willing to try it anyway. So we ordered a dish of that along with a bowl of chicken fried rice (popular). Of course, they also have a fancy drink menu. How can we pass that up? It's Vegas! \n\nThe crispy noodle dish was superb! The chicken fried rice was pretty good, but the chicken was slightly dry. \n\nOur waiter was cool and attentive. I forgot his name, but he willingly posed for us to show the logo on the back of his shirt. \n\nOverall, we were thrilled with our restaurant choice. Basically, I recommend asking for the Chinese menu. You'll have a bit more options. Spend a little more, why not?
