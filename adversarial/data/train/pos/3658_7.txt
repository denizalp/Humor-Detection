I know three stars is looked at as bad on here- but really this place is exactly three stars (which isn't a bad thing).\n\nFirst its almost impossible to get in and then people are jam packed right next to each other, plus its LOUD, so not the best dining experience.\n\nThe drinks and food are really good- however, there are a lot of more exotic, imaginative (\"inspired\") choices, however, if you just want standard fare, you'll have trouble finding anything.  Plus this place is just a bit on the high price side for what you get (again- the food is absolutely quality - but you have to run up a big check to not go home hungry.)
