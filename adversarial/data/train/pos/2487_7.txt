I'm so fortunate to live just so close to Prof Brake Serv!  I was searching yelp and they were only 1\/2 mile from where I live so thought I would give it a shot.  I went in with very noisy (grinding & sqeaking) front brakes, and knew the back ones needed replacement.  I had the front ones replaced only a year ago in LA and was told that they were not adjusted properly.  So they had to sand them and soaked them so they would lay properly on the rotors to (hopefully) get rid of the noise. I was told if that did not work, to come back.  Well...this did the trick - and they could have told me I had to replace them!  Very Honest - Know What They Are Doing - Friendly - and FAST!
