This is one of my favorite Costco locations, though there are some things to watch out for.\n\nOn the plus side, they have the best whisky selection of any Costco I've ever been to, as well as a top-notch beer selection.  There are a couple of frozen food items that we love, and aren't stocked at the other nearby Costco for some reason.  Service is friendly and efficient.\n\nBut being located in Sun City, the place can be downright dangerous when the snowbirds are out in force.  So avoid Sunday \"after church\" time and early mornings during the week.  Other times are pretty good.
