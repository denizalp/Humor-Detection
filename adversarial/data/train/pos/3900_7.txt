Wow, last review was from 2009.  I guess I would update.  They have changed owners  from the original set when they first started.  I ordered take out.  Again it is Friday and my laziness kicks in.  I got:\n\nChicken Chow Fun - Delicious and love the wok \"breathe\" or air when you open the container\nCreamy Chicken Corn Soup - Huge portion, but the soup seemed bland..  But the crispy wontons I ordered extra and a little salt fix that up.\nChicken with Cashew Nuts - Yummy!!  Perfect!\n\nI need to stop by for a sit down meal soon!!!
