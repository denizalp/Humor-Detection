I love this local casino for Thursday Night Football parties in the Sports Book, as well as their special Bingo nights. Extreme Bingo is the last Friday of every month. It's a $25 buy in (electronic) and it's all you can drink! It's a lot like Rock Shot Bingo at other Station Casino properties. A DJ is playing music and people dance during games, and when someone wins the whole table gets a shot. And every Saturday at the 11 o'clock game they have the same deal with their \"Ladies Night\" where you can win purses, etc too. Bingo!
