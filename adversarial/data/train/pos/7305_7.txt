I have a couple of problems with this spot:\n\n1.  Service\n\nNot friendly and not personable.  The last time I was here, my tech finished, and just left me in the chair.  Not a word, nothing like \"bye\" or, \"I'll be back.\"  So, ten minutes later, I put on my shoes and paid.  Weird.\n\n2.  Work\n\nI think I'm done with their pedicures.  I mean, they get the nail polish on correctly, but the rest is pretty crap.  They do the least amount of work possible.  I also once got an infection from this spot.  Why do I go back, what is wrong with me???\n\n3.  Decor\/Equipment\n\nThe massage chairs make weird grinding noises.  Everything looks dated. Blech.\n\nOverall, we all can do better than this place.  Try the seven million other nail spas in Vegas.
