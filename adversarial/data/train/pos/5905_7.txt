...can someone please explain to me why anyone would venture to this place, or how it is a sustainable business model to place a bunch of upscale stores and subpar dining options way down in Henderson without a single anchor store to be found?  Admittedly visiting myself to take a look at the Whist menu (yawn) before perusing the d√©cor at the sister cocktail bar next door there is not one thing worth coming to The District for that cannot be found within a fifteen minute drive - both new restaurants included.
