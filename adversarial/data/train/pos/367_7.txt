Been eyeing this spot ever since I exited the freeway (215 and Decatur). Well today was the day to give it a try. Nice large place, plenty of seating both table and bar seating. Good menu with plenty of options to customize your order. Daily specials also available for $9.99 which comes  with two entree items, rice and salad. I wasn't that hungry today so ordered the chicken shawarma. Wrap was nice and toasted and plenty of meat. I had to order a little more sauce but after that was pretty good 4\/5. Next visit I will try the lunch specials. The baklava also looked delicious!\n\nIf you are military, veteran or police you get a free regular drink. Nice that they recognize us and appreciate our sacrifice.
