My stomach hurts so bad as I write this review, I am definitely torching this place. \n\nThis place is terrible! My whole family got sick after eating here. As I lay here feeling full of regret and in disbelief of how disgusting our dinner was here, my stomach is extra tender and sore and my mouth is numb and dehydrated. \n\nI'm full Vietnamese and this place is such a huge embarrassment and a disgrace to real authentic Vietnamese food. \n\nFirst offense - the goi cuon (shrimp and pork spring rolls\/ summer rolls) were tiny and barely had any filling inside. A piece of lettuce, a tiny bit of noodles, a sliver of meat and 3 slivers of shrimp. Oh, and that so called dipping sauce was so gross! Super watered down. What a ripoff. \n\nSecond offense - Msg was never really an issue for me and it never really caused me any problems, until I ate here. Also, my uncle is really sensitive to it and he had a lot of issues with his pho. He didn't drink any of his pho broth because it had too much MSG and by the end of dinner he started to feel sick. \n\nThird offense - the nuoc cham (fish sauce\/dipping sauce) was so watered down, that I ended up asking them for 3 bowls for my meal - but even 3 bowls was not enough and I finally gave up. It was disgustingly bland. I was pretty much pouring sugar water onto my rice. \n\nFourth offense - my pork chop was dry and the marinade was bland. The charring on the pork chop tasted artificial. \n\nFifth offense - our tongue is all sorts of numb and shriveled up after eating here. I guess MSG does that to you. We're extremely weak, thirsty and dehydrated now. \n\nSixth offense - the chow fun beef noodles in gravy (hu tieu xao bo) was so unappetizing and unappealing, I was in disbelief they served it to us. They overcooked the chow fun noodles so they broke up into a billion of small pieces when you tried to pick them up with chopsticks, the gravy was all watery and goopy. It was not tasty at all. \n\nWith so many options in Vegas to get Vietnamese food late, this place is not one of them.
