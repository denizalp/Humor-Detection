I am so into Polish food, like I might actually be an Eastern European peasant at heart. For example, I've never really been into dumplings, the food of my people (my actual people, the Chinese), but pierogis? Chewy, doughy, filled with things that are not ginger\/scallions-related. Pierogis are a revelation. \n\nThe line was almost out the door when we arrived here on a Saturday around 5pm, but it went by quickly due to the cafeteria-style efficiency. I got the stuffed cabbage, which was basically meatloaf, wrapped in a cabbage leaf. I know that sounds not so appetizing, but it was so soft and tender (is tender really the appropriate word here), that I didn't have to chew. \n\nWhich will be perfect for when I fully (d)evolve into peasanthood and lose all my teeth.
