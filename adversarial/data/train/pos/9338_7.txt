This show is passable, but it needs work.  It's a lot more mild than wild.  It doesn't know what it wants to be - a tasteful art production?  a sexy topless old-school revue? a singer show? a strip club act? burlesque?  It does not do any of these things well.  Sydney After Dark does not compare to Peepshow at all.\n\nThe ladies are very tall, and very skinny.  Basically, they all look like semi-sexless barbie dolls and almost all of them were blonde.  I guess this is the only body type which is considered attractive anymore, but it seems a bit odd to me that a topless show only includes women with A & B cups.  Some of the women did not go topless at all.  Some of them didn't seem very comfortable or happy to be doing an adult show, which really detracted from the sexiness.  I would think that they could find more dancers who don't have a problem with taking their tops off.\n\nAbout 1\/3 of the show was dead boring or comically terrible, 1\/3 was just okay, and 1\/3 was actually sexy.  It had a slow and awkward start, and as others have stated, the show is disjointed and has a lot of bad transitions.  Some of the better bits were the cowgirl, schoolgirl, belly-dancing, numbers with more actual dancing.  Others, like the aboriginal dance, and gothic scene, felt like they didn't belong in the show.  The singing was good, but didn't add anything to the show.  They need to speed up the show and rework the beginning to be a lot sexier and energised.  Get more costumes that enhance these women's bodies rather than highlight how few curves they have.
