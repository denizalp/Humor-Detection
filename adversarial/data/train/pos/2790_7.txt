Man this place was \"LIT\". I met Kevin Hart while I was here and next thing I know he was out on the stage rapping! Tunes were provided by Future's DJ Esco as well as a few other celebrity DJ's. I heard this place was poppin' but was not expecting it to be that much fun. The dance floor was packed and the lights and all of the other bells and whistles really set the atmosphere. We had a table in VIP that came with bottle service and I really liked how the tables were still connected to what was going on in the public part of the club and not separated like they are lots of the time. It was nice to have a place to retreat back to.  They had in house break dancers and choreographed dancers for every song played outside of the celebrity performances. Lots of attractive people just having a good time. No violence or police. No issues at all! I can see why this club is so hot right now. I'm not a club hopper at all so hopefully that helps you put this review in perspective. It really was a good time. I hear new years is going to be epic!\n\nP.S-They have an outside pool area....\n\nNot so humbly submitted,\nMichael C.
