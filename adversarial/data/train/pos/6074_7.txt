Love BJ's Brewery! Always a great selection, casual atmosphere, and amazing service. Went in tonight with the family before the coyotes game. As usual service was great. Quick on re fills, food came out perfect, and very friendly. Food was delicious and I love the presentation of the food. They really care about their customers. \n\nWe started with the buffalo wings and calamari. Their wings are my favorite. Their buffalo sauce has so much flavor and not too hot.  Got the ribeye which was delicious especially for not being a steakhouse. My family got the prime rib sandwich, buffalo chicken grill cheese, chicken club, and jambalaya. Everything was amazing! \n\nHighly recommend for any occasion. Great for families, date night, and friends. There is something here for everyone. Can't wait to come back!
