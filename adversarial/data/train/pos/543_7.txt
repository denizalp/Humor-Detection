The place itself is a little too small, and the chairs and tables are placed very closed to each other (perhaps too close, making movements almost impossible).\n\nI ordered the beef fried rice and my girlfriend had the general thai. I ordered mine extra spicy and oh boy those chilis were HOT. So hot that I can barely taste anything else (coming from a guy who feeds on spicy Sichuanese cuisine almost daily). I still managed to finish the plate but my suggestion is to never ask for extra spicy in this place because their peppers are much, much hotter than any other Thai Express.\n\nThe rice I had was not properly separated, meaning that I had many \"clots\" of rice grains that were tasteless. In addition, the chicken from the general thai was over-fried, such that it was a bit too hard to bite.\n\nFinal verdict: given it is fast-food place, it is really not that bad.
