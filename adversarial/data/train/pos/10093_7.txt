The Stone Rose at the Fairmont Princess is the 5th Gerber Group lounge I've been to.  I used to frequent one all the time in Boston and I was just at the Stone Rose in NY last month.  The inside part of the bar looks pretty much just like every other Gerber lounge.  There is actually more light in there than the others.  The menu is exactly the same and just like the other locations, the bartenders here can't make a good mojito.  And because they are mainly based in NY and LA expect NY and LA prices. \n\nWhat makes this particular lounge different is the large outside bar.  Well, I suppose the Whiskey in Vegas has that too but there is an overwhelming \"resort\" feel here that you don't get at the other locations.  They are clearly nightspots.  This is clearly a resort bar.  Not that there is anything wrong with that, but you can expect to see kids in pj's hanging out. Then you have people who are there for weddings so they are dressed for that....and you have your tourists in plaid shorts and Tevas.  So it ends up being an interesting mix. Also, because of the resort feel the music isn't quite the same, its more laid back.  \n\nThe service is super friendly which is always appreciated.  In North Scottsdale where the nightlife options are few its a good choice for a relaxing lounge.
