My husband and I met a friend here for Sunday brunch.  There was a decent crowd, but we didn't have to wait long for a table.  The service was fast and efficient.  I enjoyed the coffee, but after perusing their menu, I kind of wish I had tried the cafe mocha since the coffee was nothing too special.  I ordered off of the \"Keeping it Simple\" section, where you basically get to choose three of the numerous options listed.  I did enjoy the sweet potato pancake, but as for everything else, it was pretty standard breakfast stuff.  My husband ordered the biscuits and gravy, which is their specialty.  He wasn't too impressed with it, perhaps because it was lacking in flavor.  Overall, we'd probably go back, but as far as brunch places go, this one was decent, but not very memorable.
