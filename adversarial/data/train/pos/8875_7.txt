This Sprouts was a great discovery when I first moved to Phoenix. Great produce, great natural health section, good deli, and best of all, cheap-ass prices (ie. deli sandwiches for $2.99 - now that's what I'm talkin' about!). \n\nEven though most of the Sprouts produce isn't certified organic, is spending $5 on gas and another $5 on two tomatoes at Whole Foods really worth it? \n\nI gave a minus star because their produce section is lacking at times. Any time I have to go to another store to complete my grocery shopping, I get pissed. For months they didn't have serrano chili peppers. Now I thought it was a given that they'd be in every grocery store, especially here in the southwest, but maybe Sprouts shoppers as a whole don't cook spicy food, who knows. But they have it now, which means all is ok.\n\nThere also used to be a middle-aged man who'd sometimes shop at this particular Sprouts at night wearing a babydoll dress and adult diapers with his hair in pigtails and a pacifier in his mouth. The first time I saw him I thought, \"There's no way this dude's for real.\" Fellow shoppers would just stop and stare with their mouths agape, but the staff had obviously seen him many times before since they'd give him no more than a familiar glance. And then I saw him a few times afterwards, and so he was the real deal. \n\nWhich begs to ask the question: How amusing is your local grocery store?
