Always on the lookout for new spots in town, we decided to give Fist of Fusion a go.\nOrdered a Large Bowl (2 proteins and two sides) Sesame Chicken and Kalua Pork Sisig.\nMy sides were mac salad and grilled pineapple.\n\nObserving the kitchen in action while we wait for our food, two cooks hustle (not in a good way)to get orders out as there are two people ahead of us and take out orders as well. A good 30 minutes pass and we finally get our order. Wifey luckily ordered a salad, but my bowl was a huge let down.\n\nFilipinos and Hawaiians LOVE their rice. In fact, a pot of hot, fluffy rice is one of the first things you learn how to do in the kitchen growing up. The rice in my take out container wasn't hot, more cool to the touch, and  some grains were hard. Day old rice? Possibly, but that's the kind of rice you turn into fried rice, not serve it as is, especially when hot food should be hot, and for the prices you charge.\n\nThe \"SISIG\" was anything but...(simply a play on words)no jowl, no ear, no snout...straight up bland shredded pork butt topped with shredded cabbage and a white sauce. This was barely warm\/room temp...its beginning to sound like\na CON-Fusion of Filipino\/Hawaiian food.\n\nThe Sesame Chicken (Chicken Katsu topped with sesame seeds and a sweet shoyu concoction) looked and tasted like it was prepared ahead of time and not made to order\nInside wasn't hot, wasn't  juicy at all, and portion sizes for both proteins were on the skimpy side.\n\nTo make things worse, the mac salad was a bland mush, and the grilled pineapple was so sour, I spit it out as I proceeded to take a bite.\nToo many shortcuts and overall taste makes me wish I had read LJ's review first. \n\nAnother double edged sword is social media. Food should taste as good as it looks when its posted on Yelp, Instagram, or Facebook, but if you can't duplicate your delicious looking food consistently on a daily basis, then it's a huge disappointment ....NEXT!!!!
