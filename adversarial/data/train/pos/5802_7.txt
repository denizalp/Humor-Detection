Great steakhouse that happens to be in a hellhole of a casino.\n\nThis is old school Vegas and I love it.  It's dark and looks like a mob hit can breakout at any table... I love it.  \n\nI told my old man there on Father's Day where this place turned 32 years old so they had some great specials.  I got a $32 birthday special; a petite filet mignon (8oz) with sides included.  My dad got the Father's Day special for $53 which included a Ribeye, salad, dessert.\n\nThis wasn't just an 8oz filet I had.  8oz always concerns me, usually places say 10oz or 12oz and it looks smaller.  There's no way this was 8oz... and that's a good thing.  It looked a lot bigger.  Tasted amazing - perfectly cooked medium-rare.\n\nAlso, when it's not a special, their prices include sides and that's key.  You might think, \"Well, their steaks are in the mid $40-range, why would I go here and no somewhere else?\"  Those places then offer sides starting around $12 each... two sides, tack on an extra $24.  Not here.  \n\nThe service was spot-on, which I always appreciate.\n\nTop notch place.  Yes, the Circus Circus thing is a huge deterrent, especially if it's for a date, walking through the lobster-tanned zombies crawling through the casino but once you get through that... it's great.
