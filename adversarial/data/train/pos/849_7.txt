I didn't go to Denny's expecting a five star dining experience and certainly didn't set the bar too high, but I was at least expecting a typical \"Denny's\" experience. This visit fell short in many ways.  We were seated promptly, but that is where the promptness ended. \n\nWe sat for quite a while before a server even came to the table to take drink orders. When she finally arrived, she was surprised that we wanted to order and wasn't prepared for that. When she brought the drinks out, she told the table next to us that they needed to exercise patience with her because she was brewing more coffee. Our coffee was cold and old and the $2.15 orange juice was much smaller than anticipated.\n\nAlthough it took quite a while to get our meal, the food actually tasted OK and the country fried steak was in line with other Denny's locations. The downside here is that the food was cold just like the coffee was. \n\nYou would think a Saturday morning at Denny's would feature piping hot coffee and quick hot meals. That was definitely not the case on this morning. Breakfast for two with coffee and orange juice for both was just south of $30. I think there are too many other breakfast options in the area for a return trip.
