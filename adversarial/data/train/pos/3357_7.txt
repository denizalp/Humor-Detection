First time here...  here's the gist of the AYCE Sushi side of the restaurant (they have a hibachi side too)...\n\n1. AYCE... reasonable... made-to-order\n    Lunch - $20.95 (11:30am - 3pm)\n    Dinner - $25.95 (3pm - 2am)\n    \n*Rules: \n    No Sharing\n    You'll be charged for leftovers\n    45 min for lunch\/60min for dinner\n    20% tip added to parties of 6 or more\n    AYCE cannot be combined w\/any promotion\n\n2.  Funny cheeky names for sushi rolls... \n      - Screaming Orgasm \n      - Double D\n      - Something Wrong #69\n      - Burning Your Ass\n*Wanna know the ingredients... come on by!\n\n3.  Decor is modern, music isn't too loud (good for conversations), and drinks were constantly refilled. \n\n** All in all... \nReasonable AYCE price!\nMy favorite thing all night... the oyster on the half, ama ebi (fried head) and Korean ice cream sandwich.\n\nPass on no rice rolls (not sushi). And the pumpkin soup (pureed).
