Worst buffet i've ever had and pad thai!  Very small buffet with minimal selections and very small restaurant.  The pad thai tasted like spaghetti and had no meat in it.  Everything in the buffet was lacking any chicken, beef or anything decent, just noodles and vegetables.  The soups were horrendous as well, they had some strange egg soup and beef flavored soup.  Nothing had any flavor or spiceyness to it.  I hope that what they serve off the menu is at least decent but from what i saw the portions didn't look that big.  My stomach has also been quite upset after eating there.  Won't go back
