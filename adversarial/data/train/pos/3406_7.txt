If you are reading this, chances are you're in the education field. As a transplant to the Las Vegas education scene, this department is pretty much a big ball of confusion. Approaching three years here and I'm still learning the ropes.\n\nYou go on the website to find out how to apply or renew your license, but you end up clicking links here and there until you went full circle and end up being more confused. And you remind yourself that you are in the education field and you know how to read and follow directions, however you still don't understand how one form is good for all of these different situations. Don't you even think about calling or sending an email. One time I sent a lengthy email explaining my situation to only receive a one line response that even had spelling errors. What.\n\nThe game changer was when I went to their office last week and it was the best experience. Seriously. Someone told me that it was similar to the DMV, but it was not even like that. I was in and out in minutes. The person who assisted me behind the counter was professional and helpful! She even help answer all of my hypothetical renewal questions. Yeah, I'm that person. Maybe it was because I walked in with low expectations, but I left happy and feeling pretty confident that I made the right choice of stopping by to drop off my paperwork. \n\nPro-tip: The office is located on the second floor, in a section of a shopping plaza. The lobby has a chandelier, gigantic gold lion statues (weird!), and a grand staircase. Fancy!
