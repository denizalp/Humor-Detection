Waves Coffee House didnt look like much from the outside, to me. But one night, after finding all the other cafes downtown CLOSED at 10pm, this was my only choice.\n\nOur large party of 6 barely found ourselves a table, because the place was pretty well occupied. We all ordered whatever we felt like, including teas, coffees, mochas, etc. After a few good minutes of quizzing the lady and gentleman behind the counter, I settled on the 'Red Symphony', a blend of white chocolate and red rooibos tea. The gentleman seemed to be the owner, as he was checking on everything, helping out the young lady behind the counter, answering questions, and cracking jokes. The menu looked solid, and the product knowledge seemed good too.\n\nOn to our drinks: everyone enjoyed their orders, but I.. LOVED mine. This Red Symphone was one of the best drinks I've ever tasted at a cafe.. Part tea, part latte, and part dessert = orgasm in your mouth. Smooth, white chocolatey, roobois-y.. I passed my drink around to everyone to take a sip, and everyone immediately regretted not ordering the Red Symphony instead of whatever it is they were drinking.\n\nThat drink itself is worth the trip! Waves has now taken its spot on my top 3 list of cafes in Calgary! \n\nReview #4 of Yelp's 30 Day Challenge 2012
