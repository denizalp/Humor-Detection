I love this Goodwill, it's clean and well organized and they really do make it nice to shop here.  The clothes are even color coordinated and in distinct, well organized sections.   Their half price events can't be beat for value and it's just the perfect place for the odd thing you find yourself needing now and again, or a good, cheap way to spend a weekend afternoon out of the Phoenix heat.  I scored an entire maternity wardrobe from this Goodwill for less than $50.  It was all nice, and gently used and would have cost me a few hundred dollars from the maternity store in the mall.  SCORE!\n\nFor the record not all Goodwills are the same.  There is another Goodwill at 32nd St and Thomas and it is an utter mess.  It smells like mildew and the clothes are falling off the racks, the aisles are jammed with merchandise in disarray and it's just an unpleasant place.  I refuse to go to that one when the 16th St. and Indian School location is so close and so much nicer.
