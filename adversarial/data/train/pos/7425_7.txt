Went to Momo San on friday. Here is my review.\nOver all score is a 2.5\/5\nTLDR: Over all the food was okay, but service and prices are not on point. we did not leave full.\nHighly unlikely to return, if I did it would be like 6 months later when they get the staff get their shit together.. but highly unlikely I would.\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\nService - 2\/5\nSo I placed a reservation with them the other day, through their website's online booking, it was easy and user friendly, they let you know how many spots are left for each time slot, and I got an email confirmation quite quickly.\nBF gets to the restaurant first and lets them know that we have a reservation for 4 ppl under my name for 6 p.m. Hostess doesn't find my name on the list. BF tells me and i send him the email confirmation to show her.\nI arrive at the restaurant and see that BF is standing outside, he tells me that we still don't have a seat... ???????\nSo I go inside, say \"Hi, I have a reservation under Martina for 4 ppl at 6 p.m.?\" She looks at me with an annoyed look and looks at Johnny and says \"Yea, you're not on the list\" To which I say, \"Well yea, I have an email confirmation saying otherwise\" She looks at me and looks to the back of the restaurant, which I see are full of empty seats (mind you their patio is also completely empty, although we did ask for indoor seats) which to be fair have \"reserved\" plaques on them, and says, \"well, I don't know....\" and just stands there for a good 30 seconds.... ummmmmm excuse me????? okay fine i get it you're a new restaurant and you must be new... and never had any customer service training.. \"fine, is there someone I can talk to?\" she goes and grabs another server, and they promptly seat me and BF at a seat with no explanation or apology to what has happened... then tries to take away 2 of the take away 2 of the table settings before I remind them AGAIN its a table for 4...\nHostess brings us lunch menu..... okay... maybe cuz they're such a new restaurant they're still working off the lunch menu? but i distinctly remember seeing a dinner menu on their website... looks down at menu... \"Lunch is served from 11 a.m. - 3 p.m.\"... okay then...\nI flag down another guy, who appears to be the manager.. 5 mintues after trying to get the attention of the servers... I ask for a dinner menu he gets exasperated and said \"yes of course you can, i'm so sorry, i'll let the hostess know\" He takes the menus away... I wait another 5-10 minutes still no menu... i flag down the bartender and he brings me a dinner menu...\nOther notes on service:\n+ server took BF's drink away without asking if he was done with it... he was not.. we had to flag her back down...\n+ Gemmy Dang had to ask 3 times to have her phone charged, each time they said they would come back for it, they did not... until the very last time she asked\n+ food took way too long to arrive at our table, I estimate maybe 45 minutes for the first 2 plates to arrive and another 10 minutes on top of that for the other 2 plates.\nFood - 3.25\/5\nThe signature plate was great, especially the 6 Aburi sushi. but for me 6 pieces of \"regular\" sushi was a little heavy handed with the wasabi and also lacked a wow factor. (3.75\/5)\nMomo san signature roll was meh, not spectacular, not horrible. (2.5\/5)\nThe Spicy Hot pot is a little misleading, as it doesn't really come in a hot pot, but rather on a platter? along with some rice. But it was actually quite tasty. (3.5)
