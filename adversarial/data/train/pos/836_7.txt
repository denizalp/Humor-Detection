GWIN is exactly as yelp would describe its ok... It's a fine setup for those looking for a quick glass of wine before a movie but I wouldn't be spending more than a drink or two here. Service was friendly and efficient without being obtrusive so that is nice. It's a family run joint, they own a vineyard up in Northern California (so you see a fair amount of their wines on the menu). Price point is wallet friendly expect anywhere from $6.00 - $11.00 for a glass of wine. They also have a small selection of light bites available, which won't break you wallet.\n\nMy only observation, and personal opinion is that the vibe there is a way off... They seem to have a bit of an identity crisis. Is it a tasting room, wine bar, sports bar? The 3 pretty large TV's didn't really fit (one was playing the Windows default screen saver the entire time I was there). They should have reduced the size of the bar to about half and put more lounge seating around. Have a classical guitar player or some live music on weekends. Also, I wish they had some wines from Napa on the menu, or possibly even some local Arizona wines.\n\nThey are new, so hopefully they will find their footing, but I was so underwhelmed by my experience I doubt I will return.
