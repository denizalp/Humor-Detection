The worst experience at a baseball field venue. I am not posting in regards to the food but the 15 minutes it took to get food 30 minutes prior to game time.\n\nThere was a total lack of order on the line. The gentlemen on the fryer had to stab pieces of Chix to make sure they were cooked as he put all legs, thighs and breasts in together not knowing that they all need different times to cook\n\nWhen chicken was done, there were no waffles\n\nWhen waffles were done they were no fires\n\nWhen fries were done, no chicken was ready\n\nI was 30 seconds from demanding a refund when they called out my order
