The brainchild of Zappos' CEO Tony Hsieh, this lovely little mini shopping park was a nice break from our degenerate gambling habits.\n\nNo doubt are the businesses, as well as the restrooms are ecologically made from recycled shipping containers. The businesses all operate out of the modular metal squares instead of the traditional brick-and-mortar spaces.\n\nThere are a handful of stores selling anything from jerky, art decor, bath and home goods, toys, and restaurants slinging tacos 'Made by real Mexicans - as their slogan advertises', a BBQ joint, and candies.\n\nThe center of the park contain a giant tree house, a playground and there is even a sitting area with a stage and projection screen for perhaps late night movies.\n\nIt's not too far of a walk from the Fremont Experience. Just look for the giant praying mantis (it breathes fire at night!) at the entrance.
