Awful restaurant. This place is a waste of your time and money. My family just dinned at their new location (they just moved from up the road). We spent an incredibly high sum for what we got. They bring out cold bread balls with some scalding marinara in a plastic cup. The host seemed offended when we inquired about a kids menu. The server was borderline rude. The portion of pasta they brought our five year old was more than a grown man could eat and priced that way too. This place is soooo ridiculously high for the gross pizza buffet quality food they serve. \nThey got the first and last dollars they will be getting from us.
