Really pleased. The poutine was super tasty (and huge), the hot dogs were amazing (and huge) and the Mason drinks were to die for (and huge). Everything is so inexpensive compared to some other places. Not to mention the staff ... They were just as wonderful and pleasant. You gotta try the place of you haven't already.
