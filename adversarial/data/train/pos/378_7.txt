Kandi Larkin has been styling my hair for many years.  I don't trust my hair to just anyone.  She is an absolute pro and a color specialist. If you are looking for a quality hairdo and you don't care about all the frills of some fancy salon, this is the place to go.  Very reasonable pricing and super friendly people.
