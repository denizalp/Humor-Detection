Like many things on the strip, SUSHISAMBA is an overpriced over the top version of something you could find off the strip. It's tough to rate restaurants on the strip merely because of the price tag but ignoring the inflation, I thought Samba had a good vibe, fairly good\/quick service, and a decent amount of tasty tapas\/appetizers. Ironically, I hated all their sushi (mushy, bland sushi rice is no bueno).\n\nI love the concept of Samba, and stick with the appetizers and small plates. \n\nThings I liked\n- Mushroom Tobanyaki: half mushrooms, half butter. Delicious.\n- Seared Wagyu Beef: Small but good.\n\nPretty good:\n- Crispy egg: mostly crispy stuff, not enough eggy goodness\n- Broiled scallop: \n\nDo not get:\n- Any of the sushi
