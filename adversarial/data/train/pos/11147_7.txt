The distillery district is one of my mostest favouritest spots in the city and every time I have visitors, I bring them here. This erstwhile whiskey distillery (largest in the world in its day) has now been converted to a beautiful space filled with art galleries, boutiques, specialty restaurants, etc. It's a car-free zone and a fantastic setting for getting in touch with local artists and spending a day in outdoor caf√©s. Since that description doesn't sound great enough to warrant a four star rating, I am going to describe various aspects of the area to you in further detail.\n\nMy dear Torontonians: Our city lacks pedestrian-only streets and heritage areas. This district is one of the few remaining oases in the city. We must protect it from both over-the-top gentrification and greedy developers. The moment you enter this area, it suddenly feels like a lazy French town (to people who haven't been there) - patios, chairs and tables, servers wearing funny clothes and a mandatory old man looking at you with disdain. There are two major streets and a bunch of other little lanes that criscross old buildings. The boiler house lane (which used to have a boiler house, duh) is the east-west artery and the view of CN tower and downtown Toronto is stellar. Visiting during sunset when the sky is purple and the tower is shining in a golden glow will certainly make you fall in love with whoever is with you at that time. \n\nVarious art installations can be seen all over the area, some of them are quite funny, others grim (like the boy with gouged face - atleast that's what I see). In addition, couple of buildings on the SE side have dedicated spaces for Toronto's local artists to exhibit their works. I especially like the famous critique that Margaret Atwood wrote for Stephen Harper's policies towards artistic and cultural capital - it's displayed on one of the walls.\n\nThere are numerous food options and cafes but most of these are pricey and I seldom go there. I, however, never miss sampling some beer at the Mill St. Brewery and then head over to Soma, the chocolate maker (both places have yelp reviews as well). Then there are boutiques selling everything from furniture to kitchenware to clothing. Perfect for window shopping and people watching.\n\nOverall the place will keep you busy for several hours any given day. Enjoy the DD!\n\n[ More pictures on my blog: http:\/\/finaltransit.com\/blog\/photo-gallery\/canada-photo-gallery\/toronto-distillery-district\/ ]
