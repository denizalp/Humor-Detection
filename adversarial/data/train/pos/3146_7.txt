I was short THREE cents. But according to CHRISTIAN , even with all the dollars and coins they had inside & outside of the tip jar & the long LINE, I had to go BACK to my car to get 3 stupid cents. I've been supporting this place for years & I recently came just to grab a drink.  Never coming back to this stingy location.
