My friend and I needed a last minute walk-in appointment to get our nails done for a wedding later that day and decided to come here because they had good reviews on Yelp and they were in a reasonable driving distance from my apartment.  \n\nThe location is very nice inside and super clean. The chairs that you sit in while you get your nails done are super comfy and stylish. They have endless colors to select from and everything has a matching gel color. I love that they use cute colored wash cloths for the sink rather than disposable paper towels. I love the environmentally friendly aspect of this. \n\nThe guy that did my nails (sorry I never did catch your name) was super funny, he was very careful about doing my nails, and he did a wonderful job! I had broken my thumb nail a few days prior and it had gone into my nail bed and was really sore and he was so careful with my finger. He consistently checked in to make sure I was doing ok and that he wasn't causing me any pain. He was meticulous about making sure there was no polish overpaint specks on my cuticles. After, he did a quick hand and forearm massage with some very nicely scented OPI lotion. The store was getting busy but I never once felt like he was rushing. \n\nIt was a very nice experience and I would definitely come back here again.
