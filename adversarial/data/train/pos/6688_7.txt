My BF is a sucker for good Italian food, and Phoenix has plenty of options. We ended up at Cibo when we didn't want to wait for Pizzeria Bianco. Cibo ended up being a cute spot for date night, located in a converted house complete with cozy nooks to get some privacy with your partner. \n\nCibo speicalizes in Neapolitan style pizza, with blistered edges and a \"wetter\" middle. If you don't like that type of pizza, you might not enjoy your experience here. We shared an the meatball appetizer (three huge balls!) and a glass of wine, then split the Capricciosa pizza,  topped with proscuitto, mushrooms, artichokes, and olives, the dough miraculously remaining light despite the ton of toppings! Our meal was filling and reasonably priced ($40), but we opted for dessert elsewhere, as all of Cibo's options are sweet crepes.
