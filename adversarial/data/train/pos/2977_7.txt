I had the Saag Paneer roti wrap.  It was very flavorful and definitely complemented the cold weather outside.  The staff were very friendly and accommodating.\n\nThis place is a very simple restaurant so don't expect first class service and ambience.  Come here expecting only great food at decent prices.  Will come again.
