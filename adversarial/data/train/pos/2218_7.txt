This place really doesn't look like it should have any business doling out edible goods. It's generally empty, kind of dilapidated, and the sole person working behind the counter couldn't wait for me to leave so he could get back to watching BBC news. If this was a front for the Pakistani mafia, I wouldn't be surprised.\n\nStill, given that a container of chicken biryani was barely more than a fin (with an extra dollar for boneless) I couldn't expect much. The place had an inviting aroma of saffron and spices, and the foodstuffs -- living in steam trays -- looked tasty. I grabbed a chicken biryani to go. Then I witnessed something crazy. Something unthinkable. The man behind the counter took my styrofoam container full of rice...\n\nAnd put it in the microwave.\n\nCalm down, I told myself. I had to remind myself that this is rather commonplace among brown peoples. My mom wouldn't think this is a big deal. It was only in there for 15 seconds. It's still good. Right? Also: will this kill me?\n\nI took it home and opened the box with trepidation. I was hit with a waft of deliciousness and threw all caution to the wind stuffing my face with forkfuls of rice. Damnit, it was pretty good. The chicken was the standout, really moist and not dry at all (in spite of sitting in a steam tray and then being microwaved WTF). The rice was really flavourful too. Some of it was a bit dry but I had asked them to toss some masala on there, which also serves to add some kick.\n\nThis was two servings of rock-solid rice and chicken for $5. Fine dining it is not, but a terrific value. They accept debit, but not credit.\n\nObligatory Title Pun: A mind PILOU-ing value proposition.\n\nMenu Readability: A red board features their standards, and a chalkboard features the specials.\n\nNeed to mention: Here is an article about styrofoam and microwave safety. It's not as bad as y'all think. http:\/\/www.health.harvard.edu\/healthbeat\/HEALTHbeat_081606.htm#art1\n\nWhat this place teaches me about myself: I've heard of 'nuke the whales', but 'nuke the chicken'?
