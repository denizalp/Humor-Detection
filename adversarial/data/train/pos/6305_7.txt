I loved this hotel.  During our 10-day road trip, this was as close to perfect as a hotel can be, and we stayed in several very nice places.\n\nThe rooms are the size of a small one-bedroom apartment!  Although there is no proper kitchen we had a sink, a mini-fridge, and a small countertop area.  The living area is spacious and contained a TV, sofa, desk, and armchair with enough space - perfect for relaxing or planning out the day's activities.  The bed was very comfortable, and the bathroom is bigger than my bathroom at home.  Cambridge Suites is PERFECT for the pickiest traveler and especially if you're staying for a few nights.\n\nCheck in was easy.  Parking is available in the attached garage, but you have to notify the hotel of your license plate number so that your car isn't towed, and so you are charged appropriately.\n\nThe staff was friendly and polite during the check-in and check-out process.\n\nI think we paid around $130\/night for this room via a Hotwire deal.  Parking was an additional $27\/night, which isn't great, but it isn't terrible either.  Considering we stayed in a convenient location and in a very comfortable hotel, I'd say we got a great deal.
