In my humble opinion, the best steakhouse in Madison. Oh I grant you, Madison has no shortage of quality steakhouses (Tornado, Wonder Bar, etc). But Delaney's stands above all. \n\nI have never had a better bone-in ribeye, even in Chicago. Plus, unlike a lot of the other steakhouses in Madison (looking at you Ruth Chris), they include a side and a soup\/salad with your meal. Under $40 for steak, side, starter??? Yep, sign me right up. \n\nFor appetizers, the onion straws and button mushrooms are can't miss. Great intro to a night of incredible food. \n\nAs far as drinks go, it would be hard to find more knowledgeable and engaging bartenders in Madison. They have an extensive wine list, and even more important, a great bourbon\/whiskey selection. Everything pairs together amazingly for a great dining experience.
