DATE: August 20, 2009\n\nI was leaving for Indonesia 2 weeks later and the boy and I had just spent the night before talking about our plans for the future.. As soon as I reached home, I would talk to my relatively conservative social figure of an Asian Dad and announce that I was ready to get married - to this \"fresh-out-of-college American boy\" he never met. Considering the high risk of meeting opposition from my side, we decided to make a quiet, private commitment to each other in the form of a marriage license in the city that sealed the fate of our relationship 8 months before. When we called concierge at 1:30am the night before to find out where to go, we were informed that we'd have to go to the courthouse (which was closed at the time) and get a license before meeting an officiant. At around 1pm the next day, we headed for the Clark County Courthouse.\n\nGetting a marriage license here is a pretty simple process:\n\n1. Fill Out Forms\n2. Wait In Line\n3. Pay + Answer Questions For The Official To Complete License\n\nHowever, I can't imagine that anyone who were stumbling in here drunk off their asses would be able to go through with the process. Contrary to how the movies make it seem, it's not as simple as wandering into a chapel and getting it done. You have to be lucid enough to fill out forms and then coherent enough to talk to the official BEFORE getting to the chapel. There's no way you can do that completely knackered..
