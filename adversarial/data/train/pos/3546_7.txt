This is definitely NOT a smokehouse or BBQ joint I would ever recommend to anyone. It's a weird concept because they also have fair food too (funnel cakes, corn dogs, etc.) There were 4 in our party that came in on a Saturday night- it was pretty dead inside whereas all the restaurants in the surrounding areas had waits\/lines out the door. There's a large smoker and BBQ pit in the middle of the restaurant and there was NOTHING going on in this area! I was scared the food had already been made and we were just going to get stuff warmed up. \n\nOur waitress was completely clueless- whenever we asked her a question she had to bring other servers and even the bartender over to answer anything. We weren't asking anything crazy- just if they could make a Mai Tai. Even though they have a \"full bar\", 3 of the drinks requested couldn't be made because they didn't carry that specific liquor. My friend finally decides to order a shot of Jack and said the alcohol seemed \"watered down\". \n\nFood arrives and parts of mine were cold (mac and cheese and the meats were barely warmed). I went with the 2 meat (chicken and pulled pork). During our meal, our waitress takes away the BBQ sauces to \"refill them\", even though they were more than half way full. I hardly ate my food because everything tasted re-heated and awful!! \n\nStay far fary away from here!
