Outdoor terrace byow\n\nThe waitress comes over and asks which bottles of wine you would like to start with so they can open it for you.  There is no corking fee here.\n\nmy sister insisted we start with calamari . I quickly understood why.. delicious fresh squid rings lightly breaded and comes with a horseradish cocktail sauce and fresh lemon wedges. Strongly recommend the calamari here!\n\nUp next was my feast . I ordered the gastronomie and it had many little lamb chops, filet mignon wrapped in bacon covered in a choice of pepper sauce or mushroom sauce . The meats came on a rice pilaf with well seasoned crispy potato wedges . Two shrimp had their own garlic butter sauce -omg so delish! The heaping plate also had a salad with red onion and creamy house salad dressing. My mom ordered the shrimp brochettes. The kids got souvlaki skewers and my sister got the fish almondine. \n\nGreat atmosphere and vibe. It was packed on a Tuesday night .\n\nGreat place to bring friends have a bottle or two of beer or wine and eat some scrumptious dishes. \nCome check it out worth a drive from Montreal for a get a way , you won't be disappointed!
