Where else would they put a Shake Shack on the Las Vegas strip? Of course... it's outside of New York, New York! When I saw there was a location in Las Vegas, my mind was already made up. I knew where I was going to be eating lunch on one of the days even thought I had it - twice - about a month or two prior. \n\nThis location is outside of New York, New York in what is known as \"The Park\" area. It is next to Bruxie & Tom's Urban. If you are on the strip, you cannot miss it. \n\nThe place was like a very well oiled machine. You are in the line as soon as you walk through the main entrance. There is an employee managing the line and answering questions. They also make sure customers are heading to the registers as soon as one becomes available to keep the line moving. There is a big menu board to look at while you are in line with prices and calories.\n\nWe ordered with a friendly employee at her register. We got our beer order first. Then, we waited for our food. While waiting, we saw how crazy good the employees were at their job! There were a ton of them, and they were getting food out quickly! If someone came to the counter to complain or ask for something, they were quick to resolve the problem or get the items customers needed. I was definitely amazed.\n\nAnd our food? It was great! It was just as I remembered and the reason I had to go to this location when I heard about it!
