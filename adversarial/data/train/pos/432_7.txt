***************************** 1445 ***************************\n\n   Off The Strip Bistro & Bar is in the alley of the Linq Hotel and the High Roller, the world's largest observation wheels. They offer simple and comfort food. Well priced, good service, and good for group. I was in town for a business trip and our vendor did a function here.\n\n  The Lamb Gyro Cheese steak, the Meatloaf with gravy, the Truffle Mac & Cheese, the Rip Sandwich filled with fried egg, bacon, ham, were good. Bu the Angel Hair Pasta with 10 OZ Giant Meatball is definitely a must try here.\n\n  Drinks were strong, service was good, a casual place to watch a game as well. If you want bang for the buck and getting greasy on your face on a game day, come here.
