I wasn't a fan of this gym from the beginning after constantly being greeted by very bro-y staff members every time I went. I don't like being judged for not going to the gym very often, I'm lazy. Sue me. \n\nBut... low and behold if you don't actively call them to cancel your membership after your contract is over they will just keep charging you. And it was a 26 month contract instead of what I thought was 2 years (24 months). So I just gave LVAC almost an extra $70 and I don't even live in Las Vegas anymore. Not OK. \nGo somewhere that cares about your health and not your money!
