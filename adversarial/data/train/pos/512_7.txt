I was super excited to try this place because it's open 24\/7, but it was very disappointing...\n\nDRINK: They have a soda fountain, Mexican bottled sodas, fresh Jamaica and Horchata, and fresh squeeze orange juice. The orange juice is delicious. For the fountain drinks, they say that if you share your drink, they will charge extra.\n\nFOOD: Ordered a bunch of tacos and the super nachos. The tacos were dry and bland. It tasted like it was just random stuff tossed onto tortillas. The nachos had a really big portion for the price. It didn't taste good though. I got my nachos with carne asada and it had to be the worst carne asada I have ever had. It is a staple hispanic meat and they messed it up. The chips were all soggy because they put waaaaay too much cheese on it. I love cheese, but this was unsettling.\n\nATMOSPHERE: The staff is always super irritated and makes their customers uncomfortable. The restaurant is really dirty with food stains and crumbs everywhere. I like that the restaurant is spacious and bright inside though.\n\n*I rarely give such a negative review, but save your money and get real Mexican food somewhere that cares about authenticity.*
