Great Place to get out and let loose! I have only been here on a Wednesday night during their ladies night $0.25 bottle special. I have had a blast every time! It's an interesting mix between Country Music and Hip Hop.. Dance floor is right smack in the middle of the place, which it really cool. There are 5 bars you can order from and waitresses roaming around taking drink orders as well. This Place really knows how to pack a lot people in and keep it entertaining for everyone! I give this place 5 stars!!
