Stopped by this location on the way home last night for a little  black Friday shopping.  It was around 7 pm or so and I missed a lot of the madness but they were still a little busy.  Even through the Madness of Black Friday, the store was very clean and still very organized.  I had the pictures cut out of what I wasted and showed them to the associate. The store manager actually went to the back to grab the item that I needed.\n\nI had a few question on another item I need and the store manager actually took his time to explain the difference of a few items that were different and which one he thought was the best.  I ultimately decided to get the one I thought would work best.  \n\nIt was 20% off the whole store last from 6am to 12 noon but the staff which Im sure they were directed by management were still able to give me 20% off of the few item that I bought.  I thought I was special until I heard the other cashier ringing up the guy next to me getting the same 20% off.  \n\nI don't shop there much but I definitely wanted to do some more shopping there and get more of the deep discounts.  The staff was so helpful and uniformly gave out the discounts I was definitely impressed.
