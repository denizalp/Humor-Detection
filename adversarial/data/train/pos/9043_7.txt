Slow slow sloowww! The tiny little waitress is jumping around frantically like a flea. She needs help lol. Throwing coworkers under the bus u can hear her yelling at them. I sat at a dirty table and asked for it to be clean and she had the most rudest tone ever \"okay can u just wait?\". Took her forever to come and clean. I said thanks and didn't even get a your welcome. Just grabbed dishes and walked away. Didn't even bother wiping down the table. \n\nFood isn't even good. Regret wasting my time here. Took almost 45 min for our orders. Other location is way better service and food wise. Never coming back again.\n\nON TOP OF THE MOST HORRIBLE DINING EXPERIENCE EVER I WENT HOME TO FIND....\n\n***They gave me the wrong order!! They gave me a loco moco instead of the adobo omelette that I ordered to go!!\" Ughhhhhhhhh!!***
