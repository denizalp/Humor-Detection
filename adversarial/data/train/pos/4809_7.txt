You know those douchebags that yell and scream at the television and chest bump after every play on Sundays? You can find them here. This is one of the reasons I like this place, because I can be one of those douchebags.\n\nOn Sundays it gets PACKED here. My friends snagged a spot early today so I just pulled up a chair to their table. You can hardly walk around the place. Normally this would anger me, but if I can see my football team play I could care less.\n\nThey have all the televisions labeled with the games of the day so you can make sure you have a good view of your team's game. From what I've been told, the owner seems to be a Patriots fan, because almost every Sunday that is the game that has the sound streaming. Totally fine by me.\n\nIf you are going to watch the Cardinals game, GET THERE EARLY. Or else you will be standing at the entrance squinting at the televisions, waiting for your table to be ready.\n\nFood is typical bar food. They have specials on Sundays on drinks and food so you don't spend a lot of money getting trashed and trash talking the Dallas (or whatever team you despise) fan next to you.\n\nIf you like to enjoy a football game without people looking at you like you are crazy, this is the place to go.
