I met a coworker here for lunch this week after hearing such great things about Oliver's.  The space is bright and cheery, the staff is extremely friendly and the food is good.  I enjoyed a pixie juice of strawberry, pineapple and orange and a spinach and artichoke grilled cheese with champagne greens.  My coworker enjoyed Oliver's as they offer several vegan items to cater to her diet too.  Definitely worth a stop while in downtown Phoenix looking for some quick, tasty food or a coffee.
