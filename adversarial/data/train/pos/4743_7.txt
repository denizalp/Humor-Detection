A bunch of friends and I had out Friday dinner here. \nDidn't have to wait for a table, that was super nice. \nThe burger was really tasty. I had québécois burger with onion ring. I like their bun especially, very soft. \nThe atmosphere was pretty great too, the music wasn't overwhelming loud. \nThe only reason it didn't get 5 stars was because their sweet potato fries wasn't crispy.
