Finding a good doctor, a good hair stylist, or a good mechanic can be hard to do. I already have the first two. Today I found a good honest mechanic. \n\nThe parking break light on my van had been stuck on for a while now and I figured I better get it checked out. I called Knibbe on Monday to see if I could drop off my van Wednesday morning. The guy on the phone actually suggested I try to pull up the brake just to make sure it wasn't sticking. He reassured me they would call me to let me know what was wrong before proceeding with any work.\n\nI arrived around 7am to drop off my van. The girl at the desk, Rose was really pleasant. She said they would check it out and call me later, which she did. Rose called to say that everything looked good and that the problem was simply low brake fluid. (yeah I felt a little stupid but I did look at it and the fluid level looked ok).\n\nAfter work, I caught the train back up to Crowfoot and walked over to Knibbe to pick up my van. Much to my surprise, they did not charge me for checking out my vehicle. It's not very often that you get anything for free at an automotive place. \n\nTaking my vehicle in for any service always makes me nervous but Knibbe blew me away with their customer service. Everyone here was friendly, helpful and efficient. The shop looked very clean and nicely organized, too. The location and hours are really convenient for me. The train is a few blocks away. They also have a location on Centre Street NW. I used to see it every day when I took the bus downtown to work. They are a family owned business. And they serve Tim Horton's coffee. Knibbe is on now my list of favs.
