I love this Thai Restaurant!\n\nAmazing quality dishes, great service, a live band and a full bar, what more can one ask for?!?!\n\nArrived here with two other friends at around 6:45pm on a Thursday evening. We were seated immediately and was at a booth next to the stage where the live band played. (When we arrived the live band was still setting up)\n\nThe three of us ordered to share 1.) Thom Yum Seafood (I highly rate this dish and recommend it) it was perfectly zesty, hot and sour. The mixture of seafood was also impressive. There were scallops, fish, shrimp, scallops, crab meat, mussels and squid. I loved it! 2.) Beef Salad- Thai Style (I also highly rate and recommend the dish). The beef was tender and the spices were extremely tasty. This beef salad is probably one of the best that I have had in Vegas! 3.) Chicken padt Siew (I've had better but was decent).\n\nThe service was incredibly good. The waiters were very nice, attentive and courteous. \n\n*be sure to ask for the chili tray*
