I love, love, love dates.  Until I got introduced to this place, I had only had medjool dates.  I didn't know we have a local date, the sphinx date.  Well, this is awesome or terrible, because I have been eating dates since the end of November almost everyday.  I love to chop a couple (more like three or four) on my salads.  I love how sweet and honey like the are.  We stopped on our way to an event in Tempe.  I think this is going to be my rule from now on.  I will stop only if I am close to it.  Besides the sphinx dates I am obsessed with, they also have the salted dark chocolate covered dates my hubby loves.  I am also addicted to these Prickly pear gummy candies.  Very dangerous indeed, I ended up finishing the box by myself in two days.  I will probably find an excuse to go soon, since I am down to 6 or 7 dates on the box.  The date milkshake is also a diet killer, but so yummy.
