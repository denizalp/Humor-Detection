Although an inconvenient location to get to without a car, this is a nice location.\n\nThey have ample space and the food quality is the same as the others. It's clean and quiet. \nThe staff is helpful and they always give me recommendations when I ask.\n\nI recently tried one of their breakfast sandwiches for the first time and it was excellent! I already loved their croissant but adding scrambled eggs, bacon, and cheese made it even better. I don't usually grab croissant sandwiches because I find them a bit expensive but this one was 5,15$!
