Well by gosh it happened. Somewhere after my move to Cabbagetown my former local butcher moved out of it's locker-sized meat hut and into the massive former location of European Deli. \n\nI'd heard this had happened, but I only truly saw for the first time about a month ago. I was nervous they were going to have lost some of their charm, and that with a larger staff would equal a less knowledgeable staff. I was wrong. This place is still rocking, and the staff can still give you the skinny on every farm that ships their ethically-made products to their shop. It's pricier than some butchers, but for what they're slicing off, I'm fine with the expensive price tags. \n\nSidebar: Ok, I know some of you reading this are all \"meat is never ethical!\" and I respect your opinion, but I am a carnivore that tries my best, and this place is as good as it gets in Toronto if you're going to buy meat to eat at home. \n\nThe shop itself is big, clean and you have to take a number. My fave indulgence here is getting thickly sliced bacon and free-range eggs. I'm also quite partial to their grass-fed steaks and lamb chops. \n\nDon't forget to take a number if you walk in and it's busy. Numbers are to the right of the door upon entering. \n\nPEPPER POINTS: For growing with such grace. Well done, Sanagan's. Respect.
