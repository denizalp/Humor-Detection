Came in with a group of 6 or so. Not too late, 11pm for a city, not late enough to SCREW UP MY ORDER....you know, the order that you literally WRITE down yourself? And have for reference in case you forget?\n\nWhatever. Big deal. Au contraire, we have more for you, first time visitor! What's that you say? Roll your eyes at the patron?\n\nThere's more!\n\nLet's take 15 minutes to come back with the bill, long enough for me to preemptively call my card company and say, yeah I'm pretty sure the bartender who looks like she came out of The Warriors outtake has sold my CC online. They asked me what I ate in the \"neighborhood\", I said three tacos that tasted like metal and salsa, thanks though \n\nEstablishments should look or feel sticky. Minus 100 points for flipping the lights on 15 minutes prior to last call, any more light and I would have thought I was going to heaven.
