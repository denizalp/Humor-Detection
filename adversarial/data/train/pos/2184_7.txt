After going to Hakkasan I don't think I would want to go to another nightclub again especially in the U.S.\nThis was the best nightclub experience for me and all my friends. The show, the sound, the lighting, djs, service, bouncers, i mean you name it. We were seated at the owners table due to some my friends perks. The best table in the house right across from the dj booth. The cocktail waitresses were prompt and were there when you needed them. We had unlimited amounts of water, red bull and other chasers. We had our own bodyguard. I mean this was just an amazing overall experience. \n\nI will say this, do not even bother coming to this club if you are not getting a table, you will be stuck in bar lines and jammed packed dance floor.\n\nTAKE ME BACK TO HAKKASAN!
