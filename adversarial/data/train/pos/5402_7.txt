$25 for over 100 choices of rolls, apps, etc.? Duh -- no-brianer. \n\nBaked lobster - must have.\nBugolgi - great option.\n\nI mean, honestly... everything was good to 'great'.  And, our waiter was amazing... well, service in general, since more people came out to fill waters and bus, and they were great.\n\nI was BLOWN AWAY by this place.  It's at the back corner behind Target and the entrance is near some dumpsters that stink but even then... lines.  So that tells you something.  \n\nThis is a must try.
