Named after a famous uppercut move from one of my favourite games growing up. Newly opened Sho Ryu Ken Hakata Ramen is a step up from your usual franchised Japanese Ramen. \n\nWarm wooden interior, great hospitable service, and extremely savoury Ramen. Until I had this Ramen, I dreamed only of the days where I had similar quality ramen in LA. \n\nThis Ramen will surprise you. There are only main bowls to choose from. Each come with seriously the most incredibly soft melt in your mouth sliced pork. The broth is rich and flavourful. \n\nI also ordered the fried chicken which was amazing in its own right. \n\nMy only issue which really isn't one is the large amount of oil in the broth. But that I'm sure can be reduce by just asking. \n\nI recommend this to anyone who loves Authentic Japanese ramen. \n\nWill
