When compared to other froyo places, Menchie's is pretty average. There are about 10 flavors to choose from, and they make up for the lack of fresh fruit toppings by having many sauce options including marshmallow and the occasional uncommon topping like mochi. \n\nWhen compared to other sweet dessert options available in the downtown Summerlin area though, Menchie's is a hard sell and ranks pretty low on the list for me. Indoor seating is very limited with a couple of hightops, but there are a few patio tables with umbrellas too. \n\nIn a few visits though, the service is pretty consistently absent. I've walked in twice to no staff at all and spent the majority of my time making my order before someone came out to ring me up. I know staff are young and the shop doesn't get much traffic but once they realize customers are there, they often ring up and then retreat to the back again while customers are still present, which I find bizarre and irresponsible.
