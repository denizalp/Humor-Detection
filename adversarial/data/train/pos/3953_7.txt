Amazing work!\nI have a twenty pound Maine Coon, and I am always cautious about taking him to the groomers since the last place refused to groom him any longer because of his disposition; also, when I got him home from the last place, his haircut was choppy, he was bleeding, and suffered a bit of PTSD.  \n\nThis place, however, was amazing. They sat with him and petted him while he was being groomed. He came home happy. Well, as happy as a cat can be...
