I am so disappointed and upset by my experience here. Today I was in the area for a doctor's appointment and admittedly looked a little like hell (was dressed down because I was sick!). I had been missing acai bowls and have gotten them from other vendors in Charlotte. So I thought I would stop by this place, convenient and well reviewed, and get something tasty and healthy that would make me feel better. \n \nWhen I walked in I was the only customer, and I stepped back from the register to communicate that I was looking at the menu for a second. As I finished deciding what I wanted, I looked over to catch the eye of the boy serving the bowls. At this time someone else entered the store - two high school aged girls - and walked promptly in front of me towards the register. The server took their orders. I thought, \"Okay, this is a little annoying, but whatever. If they were ready immediately and jumped in front of me, what is he going to do?\" \n\nWhile these girls have ordered and are chatting with the server, who gives them his undivided attention, more people enter and stand around. The server proceeds to completely ignore me, take his time talking up these girls, and THEN moves on to the customers after them. (Business man, etc.) Meanwhile I am literally standing just to the side of his gaze, sick, miserable, and waiting to order my little acai bowl in hopes of making myself feel a little bit better. I have worked in the service industry before, so I understand the stress and struggles of serving people. Because of this I usually give severs every lenience possible and am very gracious. \n\nHowever, this situation is inadmissible and very upsetting. Maybe the server was new, but it is hard not to jump to conclusions as to why everyone else was being served while I was standing there first, and yet invisible. \n\nTo summarize and reiterate: \nSo. Not. Cool. (Translation: I'm super upset and a bit offended.)
