I was actually quite happy with the service that I had here at this Big O Center.\n I needed new tires for my Motor Coach.  \nAs it sits most of the year, I had not driven it for quite awhile.\nI ended up getting 6 new tires for it. They came with a good warrenty. They just took a few hours to them all on. They did a great job and when I came back to pick it up, it was all done. A really good price they gave me, in fact better than Discount Tires.\nThey could not fit the Motor Coach in to the facility so they did it behind the shop.\n\nI also needed my truck tires done. I had them done as well. Perfect job , and a warrenty as well as they filled the tires with Nitro.\nThis is what helps them from going flat in the heat too quickly. \n The Manager Russell was really helpful and was able to answer all my questions.
