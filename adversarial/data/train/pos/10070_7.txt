This is a review only for the ticket clerk \"Mercedes\" \n\nWalk into movie theater at 615. \nAsk for 2 tickets to a movie at 655\n\nSells us tickets for the 545 \n\nNo big deal. Mistakes happen. \n\nAnother associate walks us back to the ticket taker who says \"i sold them the tickets they asked for. It isn't my fault they can't tell time\" \n\nReally? You could have just silently reprinted the tickets for a different time but you had to insult us?!  You're lucky I wasn't wearing my \"let me speak to the manager\" pants and just wanted to see the movie. \n\nPoor customer service Mercedes. Poor customer service.
