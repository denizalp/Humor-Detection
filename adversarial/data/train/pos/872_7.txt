This is my first review and I felt compelled to create a Yelp account and leave a review to at least warn others of my experience with Kaiser Garage Doors. I cannot recommend this company any less. 0 stars would be appropriate. In talking with John Sangster, who originally came out to my house in mid May 2015 to receive a quote on a gate, it is now August 2015, and I've still been waiting on receiving a quote, despite numerous attempts of contact and emails. My email correspondence is exactly as follows:\n\n\"You came out to give me a quote about the installation of a gate\/block wall in late May, and it's going on two months now, and I have yet to receive a quote from you, despite trying to follow up with you. I'm surprised it's taken nearly two months for just a quote for my project, however, how much longer do you think it will be to provide me a quote? And if I decide to go with Kaiser, is this the level of service I can expect from the installation on my project?\"\n\nHis response was:\n\n\"Yes we are very interested in working with you on this project and  I will have a quote for you on Monday. I appreciate your input and no this is not an example of the service you would receive. Thank you and hope I can gain your confidence\"\n\nWell, John, you did absolutely nothing to gain my confidence because nearly a month after your email and another follow up email to you, I have yet to receive a quote. There's nothing I hate more than my time being wasted, and my time was wasted, so I hope this review warns others as to not waste their time as well. Look elsewhere. There are many companies out there that would be appreciative of your business. Kaiser Garage Doors is not.
