I really have nothing to compare Vape Central to, but this is a cool little place. Picture a hookah bar vibe, but all flavored liquids (made with vegetable oil I believe) smoked using an electronic base. Now, I am not a smoker, but the husband occasionally smokes socially....which I dislike. I don't like riding in the car with him after a night out when he smells like smoke.... this is one of the great benefits of the electronic cigarette... no smell! great. Additionally, I don't like having smoke in my face when out with friends... this fixes that problem as well. So we went here yesterday and the people who work here were friendly and helpful. They let us try a few different flavors to see what we liked. The flavors ranged from fruity to minty to dessert -y... very wide variety. The husband got all set up with the base, the charger, and a thing of liquid for 40$.... not bad. I would recommend this place to anyone looking for a 'fancy' electronic cigarette or a new flavor of vape liquid.
