Over and over, I kept trying to get the sign's attention to at least get me a drink or something. I mean, the place wasn't even busy!\n\nSo I decided maybe the bar was busy, so I changed my order to an appetizer. And the sign just kept ignoring me! So I shouted louder and louder and still, the sign wouldn't get me anything. Wouldn't even look at me!\n\nIf I could have found the manager, I totally would have complained.
