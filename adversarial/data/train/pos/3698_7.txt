I was listening to 93.1fm on the radio where every Friday night the Racino plays old school hip hop. No cover charge. The music on the radio sounded like it would be a good time. First of all,  It's allllllll the way in the back of the casino. Its in an area that looks like a emptied cafeteria. This is not for anyone 30 and younger. This is for your grandparents to go and have a good time. Like jazzercise for the elderly. The Players Club geriatrics edition. This is nothing compared to the casino downtown. I'll try again in the summer for the horse racing.
