Oh. My. God.  \n\nRead Wanugee N's review and then book tickets to go see this show.  \n\nLike many, I grew up watching the Disney cartoon, bought the CD soundtrack, belted out the songs on every car ride and while I showered.  This musical brings all those precious memories and nostalgic feelings back and then some.  Such a magnificent show, from beginning to end.  The costumes, the singing, the performances...flawless.
