It's official, I am OLD. \n\nWe booked Planet Hollywood on a whim. I'm glad we did! \n\nWe arrived very early for our room, 10:00am, but were pleasantly surprised to find the room ready for our arrival. We went up and got all settled in. \n\nIt's easier to just make a list of the pros and cons - \n\nPros - \nLocation - perfect. \nEasy in and out on foot - much improved from the former property. \nBusy and exciting - a lot going on in that place. \nGreat room - size was huge and I enjoyed the large bathroom with the shower and toilet separate. \nModern amenities \nLots of food and shopping options. \n\nCons - \nThere were a lot of younger people staying at this hotel. It was loud in the afternoons and evenings, but quiet at night. \nThere seemed to be a lot of drunkies in the elevators and on the casino floor. \nThere seemed to be a lot of just kind of 'hanging out' in the hallways at all hours of the day and evening. \nThere seemed to be a lot of 'pretty people' at the pool. I'm not pretty and not interested in a bikini contest. \nDifficult in and out in a taxi. Although the location on the strip is good, the taxis go around back. I would estimate the wait time to make the turns into the taxi area adds $5 to the tab. \n\nIn looking back, it was a great option, but I don't see myself as hip. I'm glad we stayed there, but would more than likely not stay again.
