BUYER BEWARE!! \n\nThey will take your money saying that they ordered what you asked for and over a month of waiting and still no holster and now they want to act like they have no idea what we are talking about and are trying to refuse to give a refund.  These people are liars, frauds and very unprofessional (Paul especially is very unprofessional).  They will try and do intimidation tactics on you because they are all packing.    DO NOT GO THERE!!!!!!.
