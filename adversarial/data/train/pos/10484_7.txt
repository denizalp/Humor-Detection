Seriously?  Are these smoothies made with some prized Tibetan yak enzyme or something?  What on earth justifies a smoothie costing 8.99???\n\nEven the smoothies that had nothing \"special\" about them except a little protein powder were 6.99 or so for a medium.\n\nIt's frozen fruit, people!  I'm from California, and was hoping to find a place to stop periodically, but at these prices, I just felt ripped off.
