Seeing as though Texas de Brazil is a rodent infested joint with awful service and hair in their food, Green Forest Churrascaria should be at the top of your list for date night, special celebrations, or pretty much any other reason you can think of. \n\nThe side dishes are not great - the cheese biscuits were rock hard and cold and the plantains were greasy - but you don't really need them at all. The seafood and salad bar is insane! It has raw, cooked, pickled, and fresh veg; sushi, shrimp, and lobster smashed potatoes; meats and cheeses; cold and warm salads; hot bar with soup, rice and beans, potatoes, etc. - generally, everything you need to accompany the symphony of meats.\n\nCome hungry and ready to pace yourself, as every single meat I tasted -- from the sausages to the ribs to the steaks to the chops to the straight up slab bacon -- was 100% perfectly cooked and flavorful through and through. The servers were fast and courteous and made sure to stop by our table with each item that came out of the kitchen.\n\nThe wine list is small but curated and cocktails are strong. The dessert cart is everything you'd want for a post-meat coma: fruit tarts, chocolate mousse, flans and brulees, and usually a giant slice of some decadent cake.\n\nOverall, Green Forest Churrascaria is worth every penny of what some would consider to be a pricey meal; however, I challenge you to compose this sort of extravagant meal on you own. Can't be done.
