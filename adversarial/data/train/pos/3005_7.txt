Atmosphere: One of the prettiest nightclubs I've ever been too. Crowd is diverse, which was nice. Lots of tables, and a BEAUTIFUL PATIO that you can walk around. So much space, but then again, you can't really sit in too many areas unless you paid for it. I don't know...the place is pretty.\n\nService: Got there early, so we didn't have to wait too long. Our guest list sign ups got mixed up though, so the guys still had to pay the $30 cover fee (girls got in for free). I don't know...the place is pretty.\n\nMusic: Decent dancing music. Transitions between songs were done pretty well. I don't know...the place is pretty.\n\nDrinks: Didn't buy any, sorry! I'm sure they're expensive though? I don't know...the place is pretty.\n\nFun thing: Happen to be there on a night when some guy made it rain. IT WAS AWESOME. My guy friends ended up reimbursing themselves for the cover charge. I don't know...the place is pretty.\n\nOverall: Above average nightclub. I don't know...the place is pretty.\n\nDid I mention how pretty the place was?
