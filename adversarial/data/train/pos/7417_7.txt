Yeah, not so much.  \n\nPros:\n-I got to make a same-day appointment.\n-There was no one else in the store, so I had a sense of attention and privacy.\n\nCons:\n-They rip the labels out of the dresses, so you have no idea what brand you're buying.  This could mean you're getting a great deal (which is what they claim on their website) OR you're getting ripped off.  I'd tend to think the latter.\n-They have 99% very, very traditional dresses, mostly in the same style (read: very froofy).\n-They allow you to take pictures of SOME dresses, but not others.  They make it seem like it's based on designer, but I felt like it was arbitrary.  I was allowed to take pictures of every single dress EXCEPT the one I actually liked.  Coincidence?  Probably not.\n-This has nothing to do with wedding dresses, but they really have some shockingly hideous dresses for other occasions.  I mean like, \"Peg Bundy Goes to the Prom\"-hideous.\n\nNow for the best \"Con\" on the list:\nA lady who I assume was the owner was hovering around me and my saleslady.  She gave opinions here and there, and I didn't really mind her presence in general.  When I tried on my second dress she said, \"Are you planning on wearing a veil?\"  I told her very definitively that no, I was not going to wear a veil.  \"Oh, you HAVE to wear a veil,\" she said.  Bemused, I said, \"Oh?  Why's that?\"  She picked up a veil, shoved it down into my hair, fluffed it out, and said, \"There.  See how it makes your head not look so small in relation to the rest of your body?\"\n\nOh hell no she didn't.  I wasn't aware that I had a teeny tiny pea head in relation to the rest of my ENORMOUS BODY.  Thanks, lady.  I think I'll be going and not buying anything from you now.\n\nIn sum: I liked them better than David's Bridal, but not by much.
