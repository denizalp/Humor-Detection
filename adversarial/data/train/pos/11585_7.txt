Of Note: We went to this place back in Nov 2012.\nLocated off the strip along the infamous Vegas Chinatown along with several other similar and typical \"foot spas,\" it is small and very dark inside.  Oddly it was busy in the middle of the afternoon.  I dont have a lot to say about this one.  Just a weird experience.  We did some sorta \"detox\" treatment and they placed this electrode like instrument in the foot soak and sometime later the water turned a strange color.  This was their \"proof\" that it had drawn out the poisons from our body...WHATEVER!!
