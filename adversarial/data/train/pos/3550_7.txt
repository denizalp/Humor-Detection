I stopped by with CM on Thurs. night.  Given that I was coming from an event in the Strip District, that I had a City Dining Card for a free coffee or espresso, and that this shop is open until 9pm, it seemed like a good place for a rendezvous for some hot beverages and casual conversation.\n\nSince I'm not a coffee drinker, CM took advantage of the City Dining card offer, and I ordered a medium chai latte ($3.65), based on Rachel C.'s recommendation.  Usually, I'm hesitant to award 5 stars based on only one drink or food item, but if ever there were a perfectly prepared chai latte, this was it.  It came with beautiful latte art (see photo), the foam was rich and well-spiced with chai, and the drink was well-balanced.  If you enjoy chai tea or lattes, you'll definitely enjoy this drink!  Unfortunately, I forgot to try one of their pastries, as I intended to do, given that many reviewers have spoken highly of them.  I'll definitely have to return to try one, as well as their hot cocoa.  If CM and I come together again, I'll have to ask the barista to put a heart in his drink!  ;-)\n\nThe atmosphere was very appropriate for a non-chain neighborhood coffeeshop, with indie music playing loud enough to be heard, but not enough to impede conversation, warm wooden tones, and a mix of high top and regular tables.  Though I appreciate their evening hours, I only wish they were open later (like, until 10pm), since CM and I would have liked to linger longer.
