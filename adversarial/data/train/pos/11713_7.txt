This is a review of one experience getting breakfast here about 5:00 am. They appear to be one of the few chains offering 24 hour service, and I needed breakfast at 5:00 so stopped here. \n\nService is lacking at this hour. When I came in there was no hostess or server anywhere. Someone showed up in a minute or two, but it took several minutes for me to get my order placed and then 25 minutes to get a basic breakfast served. It also took about five minutes or so to get coffee. \n\nThe breakfast was two eggs, sausage, potatoes and toast. At least it was hot. It was also pretty decent as far as breakfasts go. The price with coffee was about $10. \n\nThe server was nice, but it didn't seem they were really set up to provide proper service\nIn the early morning.
