Terrible dealership, pretty much get what you pay for here. Sold me a 2003 Honda accord with a bad transmission for 6800. The engine light came on two days after driving the car. Called the dealership and asked them to repair it, and they referred me to their shady mechanic. I thought dealerships were required to sell cars that passed inspection tests from the State. DONT BY A CAR HERE UNLESS YOU PLAN ON SPENDING SOME SERIOUS MONEY TO FIX THE CAR.
