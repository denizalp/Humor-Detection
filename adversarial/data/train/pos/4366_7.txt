I only went through the drive-thru on my last visit, and I was pleasantly surprised with all aspects. The first thing I liked was being able to place your order face to face with an actual person instead of a speaker! They asked my name, and repeated my order back to me to make sure it was correct. When I drove around to the second window, they greeted me by my first name and handed me my drink. Lots of smiles, pleases and thank yous all around. The customer service here is top notch, for a fast food joint anyway.\n\nMy food came out quickly and I was on my way. Everything came out HOT. I ordered the 4 pc chicken tenders, with fries and a drink. I also ordered the garlic sauce, ranch, and buffalo for dipping! No charge for extra sauces :) The garlic sauce was bomb. Creamy, garlicky, it tasted just like a garlic ranch. The ranch sauce was kind of weird. It didn't taste very ranchy and was similar to the garlic sauce but without any garlic. I wouldn't order ranch again from here. The buffalo blue was a hot buffalo sauce and was pretty good. The fries were skin on and came out crispy. They were very tasty as well, seasoned just right. To drink I just got a boring Sprite- but they do have the Freestyle machine so you can get any drink you want. I have read many great reviews about dining inside, and plan to do that on my next visit.
