Booked over the phone for the mgm signature in May. Turns out they booked it for March, I should've reviewed my contract better. Show up in Vegas, no hotel. I called the co., they rebooked us at the aria, which was awesome. So I cancelled our emergency reservations at another hotel to stay at Veer. \n\nBUT THEN they cancel my reservation (ie breach their contract) as the guy is meeting us to let us in the condo for \"maintenance\" issues. we have nowhere to stay.  (After reading some reviews, this appears to be a thing.) \n\nEventually they tell me they can put me back in the mgm Friday night, but I have to pay SIX HUNDRED DOLLARS extra to stay at the desert Wyndham on Saturday. Ridiculous. Upon arrival to the Wyndham, I find out they booked me for two nights, not one, and the folks at the hotel can't fix it. \n\nThey never sent me reciepts or confirmations. So the whole thing was confusing and too much moving around. Book directly with the hotel or use a reputable site. These guys will throw a major wrench in your vacation plans with runarounds, extra charges which are now being evaluated as fraudulent, and poor communication.
