It isn't often that I get to go to see a Cirque but I loved each one and this one is still 5 stars because of my overall experience.  I went on the 9:30 showing on Sunday and got the tickets through the ticket discount booth outside of the Coca-Cola store.  That booth looks straight up shady but the discount cannot be beat.  There is no gimmick to their discount and we got 35% off of the ticket price.   \n\nAfter purchasing our tickets, the woman tells us to pick up our tickets sooner than later because the seats will be better if we go sooner.  It was about 12:30 in the afternoon when we went to pick them up.   The woman at the ticket office must have either been in a good mood or just liked my Hubs and I.  She upgraded our seats to the first row and almost ended up being picked to go on stage.  Ends up the lady next to us went up there!  :)  \n\nThe acrobatics are amazing, the clown hosts are hilarious and very endearing...but there is no clear plot or theme to the show.  A friend of mine said that was why it was his least favorite Cirque.  I still give it 5 stars!  I loved every second of it; well, except the 2 times the performers almost fell from a great height!  Uh oh!\n\nI highly suggest you wander the casino of the Cirque you want to see.  Aria also had some box office special or hotel special where you buy one ticket and you get the second one for $30.  I think our ticket booth was still a better bargain though.  Swing by, you have nothing to lose!
