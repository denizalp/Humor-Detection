Diner's, Drive In's, and Dives is so hit or miss on their recommendations.  The Four Kegs seems to fit the pattern.  The original stromboli that everyone raves about- didn't impress us that much.  If you live in a major city, you can find a stromboli in your home town just like it and in many cases - better.  We did like the dough, which is a huge part of any stromboli.  It's nice and browned, with a buttery flavor to it.  Other than that we were not impressed with the fillings here.  It was mostly an average quality black forrest ham, although there were supposed to be pepperoni and salami in there as well.  No other flavor really stood out.  Black Forrest ham isn't an italian meat, not sure why they are using it here when you have so many great Italian cold cuts to chose from.  The stromboli also could have had more cheese and marinara sauce.  Only 3 stars. http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/four-kegs-sports-bar-las-vegas?select=dJ5C1t4So4ZeWE3FDocWKQ#aHBeyIiUwWA0g3ATNPnR5g\n\nIf you are going to come here make sure you get the Meatball Boli.  Four Kegs meatballs are very tasty.  Surrounded by the excellent golden buttery crust, this one was a winner.  We ordered a side of marinara sauce to dip in and I suggest you do as well.  It's not an amazing sauce, but I found a little dip went a long way.  It could have used a few more meatballs in this boil as well, especially since we were sharing.  4.5 stars for the Meatball Stromboli.  http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/four-kegs-sports-bar-las-vegas?select=dJ5C1t4So4ZeWE3FDocWKQ#xhW180LRrXist_kfJBrl-Q\n\nMy wife rocked the boat and got the Chicken Philly.  I wanted to try the Philly cheese steak since a few people have raved about it on yelp.  But she loves a good a chicken philly, unfortunately this one was just kind of average with green peppers and onions.  Nothing too remarkable about it and it made her wonder why we drove here.  Also the potato salad was very sweet and blah. 3 stars.  http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/four-kegs-sports-bar-las-vegas?select=dJ5C1t4So4ZeWE3FDocWKQ#m47QUO5PiUWFKIVpjdKciA\n\nMy daughter had some kind of fried mac 'n cheese nuggets.  Yuck!  If I never ate one of those again it would be ok with me.   It was clearly Kraft Mac -n Cheese balled up, breaded and deep fried.  Her fries were very uninspired as well.  Based on what we tried, I found Four Kegs to be a one trick pony with the Meatball Boli.  Perhaps pizza is good here, since they have a good dough and seem to know what to do with it.  I'd say Four Kegs is best for locals only.
