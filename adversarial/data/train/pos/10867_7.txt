I totally enjoyed my visit to this ball park. \n\nParking was easy ~ have you been to a Chicago baseball game? \n\nThe park was clean, the people were friendly, and there were no lines for the ladies room. \n\nWith the roof closed, a necessity on this particular evening, it did feel dark. However, that did not have a negative impact on my review. It appears that there is not a bad seat to be had. Have you thought about having known people lead the 7th inning stretch singing?\n\nIronically, the very first beer vendor that came our way happened to have grown up in the same small suburb of Chicago that I did.  What a riot.
