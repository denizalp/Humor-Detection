Tonight one star is suffice.  Reserved seats again at the bar w\/ no one there yet.  Last two times, the people never came.  Since when did they start holding multiple seats at a bar anyways & what's the time limit cause I've witnessed hours of 'no shoes.'  Sorry Hanks, but I've been a regular here since you opened.  Chef Jose is a sweetheart still & I know if I went back to find him he'd find me a nice seat & make the experience special.  \n\nThe GM Roy had zero to say as well when I mentioned this to him.  Wow.  A friend of mine was in town & asked for a recommendation on steak & I did not even think of Hanks cause of how it has been the past five months.  Pointing out something that you should think about.
