Solid 3.5 stars but it will get 4 for its reverse happy hour that starts at 8 pm and plays host to some very well priced food and drink options.  While I have yet to have a full meal off their regular menu, what I have tried from their HH menu is enough to keep Keegan's on the list of viable options we have going in this neck of the woods.   A personal favorite among us are the potato skins as well as the hummus.  \n\nThe mood here is clean and casual.  There are tvs available to watch the current sporting event and a full service bar.  Or have a seat in one of their spacious booths.
