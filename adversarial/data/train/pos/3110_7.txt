Brian Malarkey has joined the bandwagon of celebrity chefs and finally opened his own restaurant in Caesar's. Located right next to Omnia, the offerings aren't limited to seafood. Every Vegas restaurant has to offer steak and Searsucker is no different. But, I like some of the farm offerings as well including pork, chicken, and even rabbit. For Vegas standards, the entree prices are on par, but I see a lot of value in the small plates. We went with a large party for my friend's 30th birthday so we got to try a little bit of everything. \n\nFor starters, the cheddar puffers were as addictive as those crack cheddar biscuits from Red Lobster back in the day. Check-in on Yelp for a free serving of the habanero, coriander pickles. A word of warning, the pickles were delicious, but do NOT eat the habaneros (from experience). The roasted shishito peppers in ponzu were some of my favorites. The texture and flavor was almost like that of a shiitake mushroom. Of the small plates, the duck fat fries with chipotle ketchup was outstanding. The mussels were great too, but I didn't get much flavor from the beef tartare. \n\nSeeing as Malarkey is known for seafood, I opted to get the mahi. The drunken cherries and smokey almonds outshined the actual fish. I could eat a whole bowl of just that sauce. The pork butt is another popular dish if you're not feeling the seafood. The desserts were great too and worth sampling. The \"ermahgerd\" sundae was delicious, but my favorite was the s'mores bar. \n\nI would definitely come back for happy hour, which runs 4:30-6:00 pm. We ended up spending over $75 per person, which was pricey, but ended up getting us into Omnia for free to see Nicky Romero. You bypass the general admission line as well. Win!
