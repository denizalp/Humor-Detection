Do you remember as I do, playing The Oregon Trail video game on your apple IIe in elementary school? The part I always loved(besides naming people cool names), was the hunting feature.  You would shoot a huge buffalo and could never carry back your entire compliment of meat.  Well, old school video games beware, Fogo De Chao has figured out a way to carry back the entire tomb of meat and place it right on your plate.\n\nNo joke, I have never seen more protein in a confined space.  You have around fourteen  options of different meat and by the second round, the types really starts to blur together.  There is filet, strip, chicken, sausage, etc...  The theme, is that comes hot and in mass quantities.  At first look the price tag looks pretty reasonable, but do not expect a  couple to get out of here for below $130 with tip. Yep campers, its around fifty a person for this all you can eat meat extravaganza and \"salad bar.\"  \n\nThe salad bar is a collection of eclectic items that really do not seem at all like they belong on a salad bar.  That being said, it doesn't matter, because the meat coma you are entering does not allow for further eating, other than the meat.  \n\nNow that I have been here once, I imagine I will go back someday, but not in the near future, my stomach is going to need at least another month to digest it all.\n\nGood service, absolutely advertised as what you get for the meal, have to give Fogo a solid rating.
