This is where I had the best cheese enchilada I ever had in my entire lifetime.... I shit you not.  Oh sure, it was cheap and tawdry, full of that yummy sharp orange cheese.... and it was amazing.  I remember looking at it, eating it, and being absolutely taken aback.... I had visions of walking down the aisle in a grease-stained wedding dress, dragging a 6-foot enchilada to the alter... \"you may now devour your husband\".  AHAHHAA, okay, I'm a little sick.\n\nIf you are a cheese addict like I am, this will surely give you your fix.  Every time I go to Las Vegas, I try to stop here and get an enchilada.  Sometimes the simplest things in life can be memory-makers.  :)  Enjoy!
