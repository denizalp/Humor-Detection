So you too go to the Fascist Tsao Mao? Yeah? Good fo you.\nThey have an ABC store there, with the big cans of Monster for cheap. They also have a Mac store that is always full of people. Last time I was there some dude had a seizure and fell into the front window display, sending several Macbook Airs crashing to the ground. It was surreal. Major kudos goes to the lounge-y areas outside Neiman and Macy's, basically a place for me to read and clear emails off the Crackberry while the woman heats up the plastic. Tip: Remember to take a cellie pic of your parking space number, otherwise you join the zombies with their key fobs in the air, waving them like they just don't care.
