Came here for a group study session, yes thats how sad my life is.  Here for training in North Vegas, one of my friend got a time share here and we few of us met up here to get some studying done. \n\nThere are office rooms for guest to use, which we took advantage on one of them.  The room was clean and not much of distraction, we got a good amount of stuff done.  Nothing too impressive, nothing bad about it either.  it was my first time stepping into this resort.
