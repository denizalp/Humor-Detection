DO NOT STAY HERE!    Horrific service. Even the exceptional room doesn't save this place from zero stars.  I arrived late for a funeral and the line was literally hundreds of people long.  Not thinking my life is more important than anyone else's I waited ln line.  My brother arrived 45 minutes after me, and after about an hour I texted him not to come here and get another hotel.  He replied I'm all ready in my room at the Aria.  He had spoken to a manager and explained the situation.  I asked for a manager and the guy working said unless you're sharing a room with your brother there is nothing we can do,  \"We all ready made an exception for one family member we can't make one for another\"   Really, what college of hospitality did you go to?\n\nI asked him to speak to a manager, the manager said no to the latino guy helping me.  Then I demanded to speak to the manager and she refused and said I can't cut the line the wait is only 30 minutes.  This was a fat black lady for lack of better description.  This is where I got upset.  The line is easily two hours to check in, and I've been on it for about an hour, and your response is a lie. \"it's only 30 minutes and you can't cut the line\"!  Like I'm in Kindergarten.  She didn't go to hotel management school at all obviously, and repeated the idiocy, \"We let one family member cut the line, we're not letting another\".    Finally my brother came down took me to the express\/executive line and asked for a different manager who Ok'd it.  \n\nThis hotel needs a refresher course in management, courtesy and respect.  Not to mention it is so large and impersonal and you may have to wait over two hours to check in and then walk another hour to your room.  With all the great hotels in Vegas STAY SOMEWHERE ELSE!!!!!!!!!!!!
