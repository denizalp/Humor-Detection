There's some decent barbecue here. I first tried them in Waikiki and became a fan of this chain. The Vegas location is fairly large with plenty of tables and a long bar area, good for date nights or gatherings with friends and family. It's better to order a la carte instead of going with the meal deals, in my opinion, and skip stuff you may not really want like salad, soup and edamame. Proteins like the harm miso skirt steak and kale short rib don't take long to cook but can benefit from leaving them on the grill to get a little crispy around the edges. Other items we tried were seasoned well like the garlic shrimp and vegetables. The garlic rice, arriving in a stone pot, will get crispy when left in there. It's a larger portion that can be shared by two people. I loved the slivers of garlic mixed in with the rice.
