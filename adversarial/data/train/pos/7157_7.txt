Just tried BTB for the first time yesterday...wow, this place is poppin'.  We lived in Hendo but decided to make the drive to meet Debbie N there.  I don't know the gentleman name, but he was super friendly and knew we were newbies.  He gave us the menu and explained to us the items and recommended the Hibiscus something tea to my hubby since hubby didn't want anything with milk.  I was going to go with Jasmine Latte when I heard the cashier said \"Hi Debbie.\"  So of course, I asked Debbie what she wanted and made that 2.\n\nI tried Debbie's \"Large Smokey Oolong Latte with Honey, Less Sweet, No Ice,\" and it was yummy.  I didn't mix it initially so that I can try each component on its own.  The smokey oolong was good, the sea salt cream was interesting, and after mixing them all up, it was delish.\n\nThree drinks came out to be $20, and so worth it.\n\nI am glad I live kind of far otherwise, I will have to set up a discretionary fund just for BTB.
