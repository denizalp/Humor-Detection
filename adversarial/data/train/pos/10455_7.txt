The hotel has friendly staff and I like the self check-in capability to avoid yet another line, but I have to only give one star because I paid $30 extra to check in early to a room that smells like an open septic tank and my $48 steak I got to go from the steakhouse came with a plastic fork and no ability to get a knife from the hotel. \n\nSo, I ate my NY strip with my hands - tasty, but not the enjoyable meal I was looking forward to (& paid for)\n\nNo room service after 1pm is understandable since its Vegas, but not convenient for business travelers.\n\nOn the plus side, it's Vegas & a casino with some cool shopping.
