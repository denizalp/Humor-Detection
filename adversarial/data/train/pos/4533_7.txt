The WORST hot pot, if not meal I have ever had. I will NEVER come back here. Zero star review. \n\nThe food is poor quality and tasteless. They never come to clear the dirty plates so they just pile up all over the table. The service is horrendous. They forgot half of what we ordered and it was like pulling teeth trying to find a waiter to order more food (or to ask wtf happened to the stuff we ordered 45 minutes ago and never came). It takes AGES for anything to come out. We asked FOUR times for them to add more water to the soup that was now an inch of murky sludge in the pot before they came by with a jug. When you asked for something they would say uhhhh one sec and never come back. The initial utensils we got had dried food on them.... I can go on.....\n\nRAGE. I feel robbed paying for this meal. For two of us the bill came to $70. On a weeknight! (The only extra we got was one Diet Coke - the best part of the meal). For this price or just a little more we could have gone to a good joint downtown for delicious food and amazing service. For this price we didn't even get mediocre food and service. What a joke. \n\nDo NOT go here. Stick to Hipot (which until now I thought was so-so but it's like Michelin star compared to this shizzzz) or Hopo or the world bowl hot pot place. Seriously. Don't eat here. Ridiculous.
