While on lunch break from work I decided to check out Fazoli's again after my first experience about six years ago at another location.\n\nNothing has changed other than the prices going up, up and up and the flavor going down, down and down.\n\nI ordered the #8 which cost $9.79, it is Penne with Creamy Basil Chicken and a slice of pizza w\/small drink. The pasta dish I did not eat because the balsamic tomatoes were just too overpowering and the pasta being the main course of my lunch I was truly disappointed. The slice of pizza was actually very good and I began thinking that I should have just ordered the two slices of pizza combo instead. \n\nAnyways, I did contact a store Supervisor later to inform of the bitter tasting pasta and she did advise it was most likely that they added too much balsamic to it which could have ruined it.\n\nShe was a sweetheart and put my name in the credit book as that I may return and get a replacement meal to make up for the bad pasta dish I had. \n\nThe bread sticks were tasty and flavorful!\n\nI will give them another shot as I really think I just ordered the wrong pasta dish at the wrong time!
