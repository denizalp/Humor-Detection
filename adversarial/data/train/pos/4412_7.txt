First and foremost, I absolutely love Dave & Busters for its wide selection of games! However, what's truly lacking in this fairly new establishment is the lack of quality customer service. I understand that it's only been open since Monday, but for the sake of this franchise, I hope that this particular location will learn how to adapt and treat customers as they want to be treated in the near future. \n\nThis 2 star review is specifically targeted to the dine in restaurant located within the establishment. \n\nAt 9:15pm (Wednesday 8\/10\/16) my group had put our name down and was quoted 30 minutes to be seated. Although this seemed to good to be true, we took the hostess' word for it, only to not be seated for another hour later. Our server \"Daisy\" took care of our party smoothly for the most part, but we were turned off by the offensive remark that she had made regarding 3 of my Asian friends at the table. When returning our IDs to the table, she had stated that she couldn't tell the difference between them even though these 3 individuals remotely do not look the same at all! \n\nThe treatment that we had received towards the end of our meal and closing takes the cake. A tall gentleman who we had never seen before in a headset approaches us and I quote tells us, \"Hey everyone, I know you're having a good time and all, but we need you all to leave because we are closing.\" When the gentleman approached us, we were still waiting on our credit cards and finishing up the rest of our drinks. Excuse me? This isn't common courtesy at all... This is not how you treat paying customers who are trying to enjoy your restaurant. \n\nThanks Dave & Busters for the games, but please learn to get it together at the restaurant part and learn how to treat customers nicely and with respect.
