I went back to try out the Alaskan King Crab and some other dishes. I liked how the crab was made in three different ways and sauces so we can try different parts of the crab different ways. I had a pleasant dinner and the food came out relatively quickly. \n\nSome dishes like the sea cucumber with chicken and tofu was alright. A little on the tasteless side, but it was a unique way of the sauce they made it with. It was my first time trying the sea cucumber with the soy sauce concoction sauce they made it with. \n\nEverything else tasted pretty typical. Nothing struck out in particular that I want to point out.
