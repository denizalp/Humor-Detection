Called to get a bid a week ago.  Gave my information to a women that answered. Said she would give my information to the guy that does bids..well it's been a week never received a call....oh well I got someone else doing the job..\n\nThanks chip for replying to my yelp..means a lot when the owner reaches out..I do understand sometimes things happen that are out of our control. .maybe next time we can do business. .
