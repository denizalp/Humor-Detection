Ehhh, I am not feeling it. I was pretty excited to try this place because of so many raving reviews I've been seeing on social media, but what a letdown. First of all, I enjoy Vegan eats and the lack of meat is not what's missing here. There was just nothing spectacular or even remotely special about this place or its food.\n\nI selected the Double V Burger Meal with Curly Fries and a Drink ($9.89). Certainly not a cheap meal. The burger was ugly and a far cry from their photos (I thought this only happened at major fast food brands?). Their patties are misrepresented as the real product is extremely thin, plus, the fresh vegetables were almost non-existent (there was seriously a leaf of lettuce that didn't even over the size of the bun and these buns are not big). The bottom line, it didn't taste great. It wasn't bad, but I'm certain that it has nearly the same amount of calories\/sodium as its non-Vegan counterpart and totally not worth it. To add to the already insulting meal, the side of fries was dismal and probably the same ones you find in the grocery store's freezer section. \n\nIf you're looking for a Vegan place based solely on the fact that you do not consume animal products, then, it's here (though there are so many better Vegan restaurants in town). However, if you're looking to eat healthier, this is NOT the place for you. Vegan does not equal healthy!
