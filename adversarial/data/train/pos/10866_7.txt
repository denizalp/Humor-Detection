We drove over 2 hours to check out a couple of used CR-V's they had posted on Auto Trader. The one we really liked they had sold two weeks earlier and never updated Auto Trader. The other one had scratches all over the front bumper that had been fixed by the dealership poorly. Not even the same colour fix. Plus there were chips in the windshield. We looked at a few of the other ones available and almost all of them had scratches and chipped windshields. They refused to budge on price even though we proved to them that another Honda Dealership close by had ones in better condition for lower prices. I was not impressed with the service here at all. Would never recommend.
