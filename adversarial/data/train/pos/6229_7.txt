Stopped here for lunch and was definitely expecting more. I paid more than $11 for two average size flour quesadillas, a drink and was very disappointed. They were over priced and I was still hungry after eating both quesadillas. The quesadillas weren't very tasty and definitely over priced. Unfortunately, I will not be coming back.
