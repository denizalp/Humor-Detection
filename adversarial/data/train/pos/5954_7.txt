I've eaten at Vapiano a handful of times, and I'm glad that I'm writing this review now, rather than after my first meal here. I was underwhelmed at first by the concept and ambience - maybe I was having a bad day or maybe I wasn't quite open to taking in Vapiano for what it is. \n\nWhat it is: An upscaled a la carte dining experience where efficiency is a priority for a very reasonable price.\n\nAnd for that, I think Vapiano is great and holds a special place in my hungry-for-Italian heart. I really like that their \"homemade\" noodles have a bit of a chew and are generally always cooked to a consistency that I like. I tried their pappardelle with bolognese sauce once and I've been hooked ever since. You can customize your order by adding basil, mushrooms, jalapenos, etc. according to what you like. I also appreciate that you can come in without reservations on a Friday\/Saturday night and know that you will be able to find a seat, even if it is sharing a table with a few other people. \n\nThe only downside is you need to be prepared to speak loudly (kind of yell) in order to be heard by the pasta chefs sometimes, since they are in the midst of all the cooking sizzles. Last time, I asked for pappardelle and got tagliatelle instead. SAD FACE.
