This location is always clean and fast. The few times we have been, we have never experienced any problems. \n\nThe food is always hot and fresh and that means everything when it comes to fast food right? Especially when you can go somewhere else and get the exact same food! \n\nPopeyes is hands down the King of Chicken for me! I love their spicy chicken. It is just what chicken should taste like - well seasoned and juicy. We always get our chicken mixed - all white meat spicy and dark meat - mild. This is the perfect mix for our house. \n\nAnd if you want extra seasoning - don't forget to ask for Cajun Sparkle. I promise you will not be disappointed. \n\nAnd let's talk biscuits. They are good. They are not greasy and don't leave your tongue with a coating of grease like Bojangles biscuits.
