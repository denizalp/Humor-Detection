This arena is a great addition to the strip and I'm excited to see who else will perform here. I had the honor to attend the play day with Martina McBride and the grand opening with the Killers. \n\nDuring play day, we were able to roam around freely. I definitely recommend checking out Hyde up top if it's open, pretty cool. I was there opening day and it was for invited guests only but I'm not sure how this will work for other days. \n\nDespite the bag check and scanning at the entrance, we found that entry was fairly smooth for both days.\n\nPrepare to see a dip in your bank account if you decide to buy any food or drinks here. I mean I get it, it's an arena... But I thought the prices were insane. \n\nAbout the actual arena - it's a pretty good size. Honestly, I wanted to do standing GA for The Killers but the seats we ended up getting (I think in section 16?) actually ended up being pretty great. It was pretty close to the stage, albeit to the side, but I had a lot of room to dance despite the people around me who were sitting down. The standing room was packed and I can't imagine being able to see anything if you're as short as me. \n\nAll in all, I'm pretty excited to see what this arena had to bring but be warned... Drink beforehand just to save yourself a little bit of money if you do plan to drink.
