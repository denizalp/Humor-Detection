Bacon makes everything better, so how could I resist the chance to try a food truck devoted to it?\n\nBlondie's Bacon Creations was one of many local food trucks that came to Sunset Park'd in 2016. You can't miss the blue truck with pictures of bacon (and a blonde), even though these guys were somewhat tucked away in a corner near the stage.\n\nThe menu is mostly different variants of french fries and sandwiches, but I saw the Bacon Tater Balls ($6), a creation that they boast took 3rd place in the \"Extreme Bacon Bite Challenge\" (a quick Google search shows that it was held November 2015 last year and included restaurant chefs). This tray had 3 fluffy potato balls with bacon, green onion, and cheese that were deep fried in Panko breading and topped with a lemon sour cream. Although it's not the most exciting potato ball that I've had from a food truck, it was a contrast of textures and had enough bacon flavor.\n\nBlondie's Bacon Creations seems to be a solid food truck so far. I'll definitely check out some of their loaded french fries next time.
