My wife and I were excited to move from Idaho to Vegas for her job and to get an apartment here. However, not only was the realtor Johnny Torelli 30 minutes late (he knew when we were coming), but the apartment was NOTHING like advertised. It looked like the previous owners trashed the place, so they put in new floors and some paint. \n\nThe fixtures were all disgusting and old. The bathroom sink had a huge rust stain. There were no ceiling fans (again, false advertising), the tiny kitchen was an ancient plastic countertop and white pressboard cupboards (as opposed to granite and dark wood), and they tried to make the cheap cupboards look nice by plastering the fronts of them with vinyl! THEY DIDN'T EVEN CUT THE VINYL EVENLY. It also stank like roaches.\n\nThe Slavic woman that was with Johnny kept giving us attitude because we weren't drooling over the new floors. The floors are a distraction from the rest of the crap hole property. \n\nUnless you are willing to pay a lot per month and get a dump apartment, stay away.\n\nWe went to another unit and it was slightly better but still had a stink and the floors kept giving way.\n\nSo now my wife and I are in Vegas trying to find an apartment, all our possessions are in our cars. Thanks, assholes.
