I had every intention of giving this place a 5 star review. I mean I was that excited about this place. \n\nI discovered Pride Beauty Studio from a viral video on FB of a microblading session. I started following them on Facebook (the reviews were all 4 & 5 star) & even started following them on IG and Janny herself on Snapchat. \nBut I didn't want to go straight into a microblading session, because that's a lifetime commitment! So instead I made an appointment online for a New Client - Brow Shape and Tint. This was $50 & I thought to myself, \"Damn this is expensive\" but her worked looked amazing so I convinced myself that the $50 would be worth it. \n\nI received a notification via text that they had to reschedule my appointment due to a \"family emergency\" the day before my appointment. They asked if I could reschedule. I just happened to be on vacation so it was no problem. The day of my appointment they asked if I could reschedule my time for later that day. Again no problem. \n\nI arrived to my appointment and to my SURPRISE - my appointment was not with Janny. When I booked my appointment online, you pick who you want and I had scheduled with Janny. She was there - but working on another client. You bet my reaction was WTF? \n\nShe said Jessica was actually going to do my brows & asked if that was okay? What was I supposed to do? I had driven 40 minutes to this place, paid already online. Was I just supposed to walk away? They reassured me that Jessica would do a good job and Janny would talk to me about my brows.\n\nSo Jessica did her work and Janny spoke to me. They asked me lots of questions, basically trying to find the reason for my visit so they could sell me. So they convinced me to put down a deposit for the microblading. I would put down the deposit, pay half of the remaining amount on my microblading visit, and then the last payment on my 6 week follow up appointment. I still wasn't sure so where she (janny) convinced me was at telling me that she was running a holiday special for only $500 (her normal charge is $650) and that in January she was going up to $700. So I paid my deposit which ended up being $161 after taxes. We discussed the day for the appointment, it had to be far enough out that my man could get the day off and it had to be on a Saturday. So my appointment was booked for January 20. \n\nI check into the location on my Yelp App. And as much as I am a seasoned yelper, I never checked her reviews on Yelp. They were just so amazing on FB, I didn't think I had to. But boy did I wish I would have. I could relate to some of it with how she had rescheduled my appointment. If only I knew how much more real it was going to get for me. \n\nI received a text  notification the evening of January 4th: \"Hello your appointment on the 20th has to be moved due to a family emergency\".I asked if it was for the microblading & what day it has to be moved to, they informed me any other day. I replied back that is the only day I can do due to schedule. The response was \"I'm sorry, yea we can't. I just found out.\" So I asked what happens to my deposit if I cannot reschedule. They replied back that it can be any day just not the 20th and that they do not do refunds.(which was never explained at the time of taking my money). After some back and forth, they did say that they could do anytime on the 20th just not before 1pm. So I said I could 1pm and also said that it was unprofessional to not give refunds if the scheduling conflict was on their end. Then I received a reply \"I misunderstood. Janny said we can do a refund it it's on our end which is this matter, it is on our end.\" So I said I'd prefer a refund then. (Because truth be told, I was very nervous that they would text me the day off my appointment again like before & tell me reschedule anyways.) I received a response, \"okay no problem it will take 7-10 business days. Have a great day\"\n\nI followed up on 1\/19 because no refund had been issued. I was told it should be there soon. I asked to verify amount & we agreed that it was $161.50. Still no refund. So I followed up again on 1\/24. Said they needed to follow up with Janny- no response. I followed up again on 1\/29. No response.I called the number on their website on 1\/30. Janny answered and was very polite. Until I told her who I was and why I was calling. The tone in her voice did a complete 180 and all of a sudden she was with a client and would call me back. But she didn't even ask me for a number, I had to give it her. I called 1\/31 & 02\/01. Obviously, she was ignoring me. So now I have opened up a dispute with my CC and waiting to hear what happens. \n\nI had delayed writing this review in hopes that PBS would be professional and issue my refund but that has yet to happen. I just don't want anyone else to experience this. Stay away at all cost! I am not the 1st person and definitely won't be the last.
