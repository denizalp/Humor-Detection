Wow this KFC should've been the first one to close down instead of all the other good ones that got shut down!\n\nOrdered a 6 piece family meal, they give me ONE ranch sauce. So which piece of chicken gets ranch huh?\n\nWas craving Mac and cheese all day. Got so excited to go home and eat my Mac and cheese. Guess what?! They gave me mashed potatoes. \n\nIs it that flipping hard to get an order right? Besides the mistake I think the ranch sauce pissed me off the most. I get it, places are becoming more stingy, but ONE ranch sauce for SIX PIECE FAMILY MEAL?! Seriously?! \n\nIf it wasn't because the three closest KFCs to me being shut down, I would've never went here. Never will again!
