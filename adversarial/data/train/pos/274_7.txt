Man, this place was DELICIOUS! My friends and I were just walking around Kensington Market and stumbled across this place since the line came out the door. We knew it had to be worth the wait so we follow suit. We waited a good 15-20 minutes for the food but we didn't mind the wait since we were talking to locals to find out other yummy food places to check out while we were in Toronto.\n\nWe tried the Jamaican Mi Crazy Chicken, the Dutch Pot Oxtail, and the Portland Jerk Pork. They were all delicious but my favorite would have to be the jerk chicken. The meat literally just falls off the bone and melts in your mouth. The oxtail was pretty good, too but I wasn't too blown away by the jerk pork. \n\nThis location is small, only a couple of tables on either side of the store. A lot of the people here would buy it and take it home or eat on the streets.\n\nA must try if you're visiting Toronto or in the area!
