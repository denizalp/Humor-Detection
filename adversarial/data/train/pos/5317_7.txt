After the Cupcake Love In I needed real food.  Salad, ya, that's it, a good salad.  So I pulled out my cell phone and opened my trusty Yelp app to see what was close by.  Pomp Pizzeria sounded like a place I could get a good salad so off we went.  \n\nWe were greated warmly and seated.  The young man who was our server was nice and even listened to my daughter as she told him about all the cupcakes she had just consumed.  He brought drinks promptly and let us leisurely look at the menu.  They had those sticky stick things for the kids so my daughter was happily making shapes and animals while we waited for our food.  My daughter had pasta with butter which she loved. And I had salad and pizza.  The salad was great!  Just what I needed.  The pizza was very good but I though the crust should have been a bit crisper on the bottom.  I took most of it home anyway and thought it might be better heated up the next day.  I heated it in the over the next day and it still seemed soggy.  Next time I'll try it in a frying pan on the stove.  \n\nI would come back here on a lazy Sunday afternoon for a relaxing early dinner.  The atmosphere is nice and the staff was friendly and accomadating.  And I loved the italian scene on the wall.....so cool!
