I was here about a month ago and witnessed a typical NW Las Vegas idiot get into a car accident in the parking lot and totally flip out. He was driving a car which was a 1990s model, and it looked like he hadn't washed it in years. First, he started verbally attacking everyone in the area(people who had nothing to do with the accident) and then began to grab the small decorative rocks out of the planters and throw them at cars that were driving by. Then he started doing something that looked like a seizure and went on a bizarre profanity rant that was very disturbed. He literally started screaming: \"f*ck! @ss! sh!t! d!ck! butt cheeks! b!tch! boob! f*ck! gay! pube! retard! f*ck!\". He wasn't even cursing at anyone, he was just cursing at the sky. Somehow his friend calmed him down and he was able to exchange insurance info with the woman after about 10 minutes. I hope he reads this, so he can see how stupid he looked. Why does everyone in NW Vegas act like this btw?\n\nThe selection here is identical to any other Fresh & Easy on the West Coast. It's not a health food store, people just think it is. Nothing is actually cheap here. I could get sirloin for like $2.98 a pound at Winco, while over here it is like $7.00 a pound or something wild like that. \n\nThe only things I really like about this place are: the Orange Cranberry Scones, the French Roast Coffee, and the German Rye Bread. Everything else is cheaper at Winco or Trader Joes. \n\nOddly, you will find me here about once a day.
