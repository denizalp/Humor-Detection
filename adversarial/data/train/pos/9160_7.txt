Not my favorite location. I feel like their drive-through goes exceptionally slower than a lot of other locations. And their drinks aren't that great. Maybe I'm just going at a bad time when they have not the greatest baristas working, and if this is true, then I'd advise you all to not go around 7-8 in the morning Monday through Friday's lol.
