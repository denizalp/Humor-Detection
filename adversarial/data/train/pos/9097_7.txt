We stumbled around to two other breakfast locations that either had outrageous wait times or weren't open before Yelp saved the day and found Egg & I. Third times a Charm! We put our name on the waitlist for a 35 minute wait and just as we were going to walk away because it was a ton of people waiting to eat, a patron said that \"it's worth the wait.\" She even said she would keep us hostage if we didn't say we would stay. Lol! \n\nWe obliged and stayed. Excellent decision on our part! The place is sort of a dive, located nowhere near the strip, but oh so worth the Uber or Lyft ride here. It stays packed on a Sunday, which is the day we visited, but the line moved fairly fast. They apparently have take-out and show a few NFL games on a few tv's throughout the restaurant, and they have outdoor seating. Only open until 2pm, they specialize in breakfast\/brunch\/lunch foods. \n\nI ordered the chicken enchilada omelet and it was so authentic and delicious, just visualizing it now, is making my mouth water! Delicious!!! I'm so glad that woman told us it was worth waiting because it truly was! One thing I noticed, was a lot of the great places to eat, weren't even on the Strip! This was a great find, thanks Yelp!!
