My husband and I have been to Sauce a few times now. Everyime we visit, it is a terrific experience. The pizza and salads are delicious and fresh, perfect portion sizes, and the decor is very Italian inspired. The prices are just right, with a menu that's very easy to read. They offer the basics, and they are fabulous. The decor is very cozy and inviting, with outdoor seating as well. The staff is exceptional! From the person taking your order, to the person delivering, they are super friendly, and inviting. They always have a smile on their faces, and genuinely seem to be enjoying where they work. We will definitely continue to dine at Sauce! \nP.S. Their tiramisu is wonderful!
