I have a love-hate relationship with Montana Meat Company. Lunch seems to be the best way to go because service is very slow during the morning and it seems like they made their steak and egg special smaller. I met my parents here in the morning and I ordered it. When it came to our table, my dad said (in his accent), \"Why is your steak so leetle? Look how small it is!\" and he started laughing. It really did look very small and it was also kind of dry. Here's a pic of it next to my car key: http:\/\/s3-media1.ak.yelpcdn.com\/bphoto\/DTBGYRXl28VbAiQECnyiHw\/l.jpg. I always enjoy their potatos and eggs though; Can't go wrong with those. I was just pretty disappointed this time around because of the slow service and tiny piece of meat on my plate.
