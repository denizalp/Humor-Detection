I love acai bowls and although there are more and more places offering them, they are not all equally the same.\n\nI really enjoy the Acai Bowls offered here.   I tried their peanut butter Acai bowl, yes, peanut butter.  This mix was new to me and I was hesitant at first since I could not put both flavors together in my mind, but I was pleasantly surprised!   It was amazing and has been my go to bowl ever since.  \n\nThey also serve Pitaya bowls which I have yet to try but definitely will, and you can mix Pitaya with Acai.  \n\nIt runs about $8 and the portions are big.  I can never finish mine.   \n\nThe place is so cute with plenty of unique seating and the service so far has been great.
