Atmosphere: Mexico where? Literally the feel of the store is mini Mexico. Full of the Mexican culture. I love it. \n\nCustomer Service: If you ask for help, the staff is friendly but NOT top quality (the type of service where throughout your visit you will get asked like 5 times... \"May I help you find anything?\")\n\nProducts: the variety is definitely extensive, if you have seen it in Mexico... Yup they carry it. They also carry American products. They have a Bakery, Restaurant, Tortilla Production and a Mexican Fruit Stand style store... You can find fresh cut fruit, fresh made flavored waters like \"Horchata, Jamaica (Hibiscus Tea) and Aguas de Melon, Sandia... Ect...\n \nPrice: Everything is fairly priced, not cheap but not super high priced. From time to time they do carry great deals.\n\nOverall: I love going to Cardenas... If only it wasn't for the stares I get at times... I guess its part of the culture though... I mean Im tall... Overdress for everything... I love their restaurant food... Birria is bomb!!!
