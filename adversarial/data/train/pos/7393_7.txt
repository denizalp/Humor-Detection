I love going to this store, probably one of the only stores in the entire world that I can spend more than 10 minutes in without walking out empty handed. Yes this place is spendy but if you are a somewhat thrifty shopper such as myself you can actually score some really good deals. \n\nThis store also has an extremely good return policy, essentially they will take anything back for whatever reason within a year and sometimes more. I purchased a few items and they went on sale two weeks later and they were happy to credit me back the difference. I guess that procedure is pretty typical at retail stores but they didn't make me feel like I was stealing something when they were crediting my account back.\n\nAlso a lot of people don't know that once a month they have a \"rummage sale\" You have to get there early because if you are not within the first 30-40 people most of the really good items are gone. They basically resell all of the returned items at ridiculous discounted rates. All the items are slightly used. The have a ton of footwear at deeply discounted prices. Example my last score was a $150 pair of Merrel hiking boots worn once maximum for $9.83. The sole wasn't even scuffed. Just look on their website when the monthly garage sale is. \n\nThe only thing that I am a little put off by this store is that to really fit in when shopping I feel like I need to have a beard.
