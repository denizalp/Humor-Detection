Best reason ever for a $20 lunch.  \n\nYes, it's pricey, but delicious.  If you can't respect the fact that you can actually talk to the people who grew or made the ingredients going into your mouth and appreciate how rare that opportunity is these days, then please just go to Quiznos and stay away from my Farm.   \n\nI enjoy coming here solo, with a book or magazine and some time to kill.  By the time I stroll through the garden and spy on the canoodling couples under trees, my lunch is ready. \n\nIf it's not, then I start snacking on the potato salad or garden salad or chocolate chip cookie that I was trying to save- I have no shame.  \n\nThe most recent visit, I enjoyed the Ham and Cheese sandwich.  Although it seemed so unassuming, the multi-grain bread was perfectly crisp at the edges and delightful warm and sturdy without being too grainy.  The ham was freshly carved, the bacon perfectly crispy, dijon\/mayo blend just the right amount, field greens, red onion, tomato...all divine.  I really wanted a more mellow cheese- was it swiss? I wanted provolone or mozz- something that didn't want to compete with the rest of the sandwich.  There are no bad feelings, I still loved it.  \n\nI polished it off with some iced green tea and a shamelessly delicious chocolate chip cookie.  I can't wait to come back.  \n\nThey lost a star because I didn't see a sign anywhere indicating the $1 \"service charge\" on my receipt...after I already tipped a dollar.  A little heads up would've been nice.  \n\nMy tips to a successful lunch at the Farm:\n\n1. Ladies, wear wedges or flats because your heels will get crushed in the gravel driveway and then stuck in the cobblestone patio ...and people like me will be forced to silently laugh at you thinking you're looking so stylish.\n\n2. Don't bother getting frustrated trying to park inside the property, just go across the street and cross it while reliving your childhood \"Frogger\" dreams \n\n3. Bring your patience if you're here at peak lunch time!  Everyone else is in line too, but isn't this place damn cute?  Oh, and when you come back to get a refill, please say \"excuse me\" to the people patiently drooling in line, there's no need to flaunt that you've already had your food and are now on round 2 of drinks, that's just mean
