I've been coming here since it opened. I've made excuses for it many times because I enjoyed the convenient sushi it consistently provided. I never understood why a section of the bar always has a reserved sign just in case the owner showed up. But I kept coming even though I felt my kids were unwelcome (broken high chairs and menu instructions about keeping them from touching the blinds) because I wanted them to enjoy sushi instead of chicken nuggets. After the anniversary party I just can't take it anymore. What's with the Teen Mom wedding style zebra vases and Ikea style cafeteria tables that are so narrowly placed they scream awkward at the thought of squeezing through them?! Now an entire new serving staff dressed like a mechanics with a red handkerchief. I'm done.
