Drive thru is always decent. Not fast.\n\nI don't suggest sitting out on the patio like people do here...it smells.\nNot only does it stink but the car fumes and smokers are out of control.\n\nI have been inside and its not the cleanest. Maybe a deep clean or pressure wash is due outside...and in!!!!\n\nIced doppio and a splash of almond mylk is my jam.
