Ive been told for many years that I was actually conceived in this park. \nMaybe thats why I have such a bond with it.\nThats right my parents used to come here in the 80's and do it on a blanket in the park.\n\nI pretty much grew up in this park. I have been coming here since I was born.\nMy favorite was always the duck pond. It used to look different back in the late 80's ,not as clean but just as fun.\n\nMy family would come here every Sunday and BBQ. \n\nThe playground has gone through a few face lifts. \nA long time ago there used to be horse swings, and a slide and a huge monster truck tire that you could climb into.\n\nThe new park is OK.. Im not really into the new playground, I miss the old stuff and all the old trees they cut down. NO NEED TO CUT DONW ALL THE 20+ YEAR OLD TREES.\nTHE ONLY RESON I GIVE 4 STARS IS BECAUSE I THINK THEY RAPED THE OLD PARK WITH A BUNCH OF NEW STUFF THATS NOT AS COOL AS THE OLD PARK.\nPLUS  WHY ON EARTH WOULD YOU CUT DOWN 20 YEAR OLD TREES TO INSTAL PLASTIC CRAP!!!?!?!?!??!??!?!!!!?!??!\nI seriously cannot get over this.\n\nI like the new trails and the fact that they didn't destroy all the natural wild life areas. Tons of rabbits and other little animals make their home there.\nI know about 25 years ago we set our rabbits free in the park. Probably  helping multiply the population of rabbits.\n\nPlease don't fuck up the park anymore... Half of the original stuff has been totally screwed because of the new development, which I find rather annoying anyways.\n\nCleaning the  BATHROOMS would have gone a longer way than cutting down old trees and getting rid of half of the cool stuff.
