I stumbled upon another Happy Hour spot on the Las Vegas Strip over at P.J. Clarke's which is daily from 3pm to 6pm.  Their headliners are their $1 freshly shucked oysters and their $1.50 burger \"sliders.\"  You'll see why I put quotations there on sliders.\n\nI ordered a half dozen of their $1 oysters. \nhttp:\/\/bit.ly\/WYjLmu\nIt really doesn't get any better than $1 oysters at Happy Hour.  Who cares what oyster farm they came from because they're $1 each!!   Nicely sized and pretty good!\n\nNow check out PJ's Famous Sliders\nhttp:\/\/bit.ly\/XADMzK\nNow you know why I put quotations.  Sliders?  Are you kidding me?  To me, sliders are little burgers that you can stuff in your mouth with one or two bites.  These suckers were huuuuge!!  Very tasty and also complimented the oysters very well.  It's almost a steal at $1.50 each.\n\nWashed it all down with a $3 Blue Moon which is another great Happy Hour deal.  So all together, half dozen oysters, two sliders, and a Blue Moon came to a whopping $12 before tax and tip.  Awesome!!!\n\nI'd say next to the Prime-time Bites at Palm Restaurant, this is probably one of the best Happy Hour deals on the Strip.  I'll definitely be back for this deal again!
