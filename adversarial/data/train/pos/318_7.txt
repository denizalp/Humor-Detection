Very unique store where you should definitely stop by.\n\nYou'll find souvenir at this store that resembles the Bellagio garden.  Everything is somewhat unique and seems like a good fit in your backyard to make it Bellagio garden like.\n\nUnlike Wynn, the prices are VERY affordable too.  At the Wynn store, you may find something cool, but then it ends up being $500-$200000 (yes $200000).  At the Giardini store, things run around $10-500.\n\nThe worker (I believe Esteban?, sorry he was a bigger older gentlemen) )was extremely friendly and literally spent 3 minutes wrapping my statue very carefully.\n\nMy frog has made it home safely.
