The food here is good.  I like the pasta dishes actually better than the pizza.  Setebello has better pizza in my opinion.  The pasta is all excellent.\n\nThe prices are what really brought down their rating for me.  My wife and I spent $60 for lunch having only one pizza, one pasta, and one glass of wine. That's an expensive lunch.\n\nPizza was perfectly charred from the oven just how I like it.  The kitchen did a terrible job at cutting the pizza so each time we tore off a piece all the toppings fell off into a messy pile.  The pizza is good, but like I said it's a bit pricy and there are better places out there.\n\nWe had the gnocchi which was amazing.  We got the one with bacon, peas, and truffles.  I would come back for just this dish.\n\nI had a glass of one of their cheaper reds, I didn't want to pay too much for glass of wine at lunch. The one I got was terrible, but for $8 the wine should be palatable no matter where you go.\n\nIt's the best pizza in Summerlin which is convenient for me, but I would rather take the long drive to Settebello for good pizza.
