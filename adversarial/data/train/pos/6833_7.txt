Great outdoor area to enjoy the view of the golf course and get some fresh air. \n\nWas a guest at the Westin and thought it would be a great idea to get a drink before heading out for dinner. Not sure how the service is inside Waltz & Weiser but outside, it was not that great. \n\nThe servers were friendly but the drinks came out extremely late and the glasses were sticky as the drinks were made very sloppy (mine had mango puree all over the outside of my glass). Also, we asked for the check and it came out more than 10 minutes later. \n\nI will most likely not order a drink from them again but will just utilize the sitting area for leisure.
