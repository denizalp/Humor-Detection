The rave reviews so far are no joke. I was very happy after trying this newest take on the Chipotle-inspired business model.\n\nHUMMUS Bowls & Wraps is a simply and appropriately named casual restaurant on the back side of a building with more visible tenants such as Pho MaiLan and Bell's BBQ. They do customizable bowls and \"wraps\" (more on this later) with a Mediterranean \/ Middle Eastern flair, and there's plentiful seating with a rather bright\/white aesthetic and what vaguely sounds like culturally appropriate music.\n\nThe owner wasn't on premises, but a very knowledgeable employee greeted me and walked me figuratively through the menu and literally down the assembly line after mentioning that almost everything is made in-house. The steps are as follows:\n\n1) Decide whether you want a bowl or wrap.\n\n2) Hummus! There's classic hummus, spicy hummus, bean-free \"market\" hummus (spinach\/artichoke blend), and baba ganoush (eggplant). Classic hummus and baba ganoush were both delicious.\n\n3) Greens. Choices are romaine, chard, spinach, and kale. Romaine is boring, and the crunch is redundant if you get the right toppings down the line, so I don't foresee myself ever choosing it.\n\n4) Herbed rice or black lentils. Both are viable, but the lentils were pretty darn good.\n\n5) Protein, the sole determinant of price. Choices are flame grilled chicken ($7.90), flame grilled beef ($8.82), braised lamb ($9.70), falafel ($7.90), crispy halloumi cheese ($7.90), and seasonal roasted veggies ($6.95). More notes on what I chose later, but cheese wasn't on display, beef looked potentially dry (although that could be an unfounded fear), and veggies looked vibrant and almost appealing enough to choose. Almost.\n\n6) Toppings. Lots and lots of toppings. If you skimp, don't expect to be as impressed. I invested time here because the menu says \"get creative.\" Definitely look into the cherry tomatoes, the feta with some additional goodies in it, the different quinoas, the pickled onions (not too tart), the pomegranate seeds (a pop of sweetness), green onion, parsley, mint, and some crunchy ingredients (sunflower seeds, crunchy chickpeas, crunchy pita bits). Just about all of those (and more) were fresh and delicious, with the except of a few yellowing sprigs of parsley.\n\n7) Sauce(s). Garlic sauce, mint tzatziki, herb tahini, muhammara (described as roasted peppers and walnuts), hot chili harissa, house dressing (described as citrus mint). The raw garlic packs a powerful punch and both the tzatziki and tahini are awesome, but I didn't really get much out of the muhammara. I'm reminded of poke bowl places and how you can't typically get much flavor out of just one sauce, but even if you only choose one sauce for your entree here, you'll probably be very happy.\n\nI ended up with two entrees, and I also tried some sides. While dining in, I managed to finish a pita with grilled chicken. The pita tastes great but has an awkward form factor. Not only does it not really fold readily after you load it up with toppings, but it gets pretty wet unless you deliberately stick to dry items and get sauce on the side or something. Fortunately, you can always fork and knife it if need be. The chicken was pretty good and wasn't dry.\n\nI also took a bowl to-go but had a few good bites of it. Rice was fine. Braised lamb was delicious and tender. It was a modest but very reasonable portion of really good lamb. Where else can you get that sort of meat in relatively intact form? This really is a treat special treat. \n\nI'm always looking out for good falafel, so I picked up a side order ($3.97 for 4 pieces). The ground and spiced chickpea balls may be vegan, but they can be remarkably delicious anyway. HUMMUS's falafel are a bit salty, but their flavor is phenomenal compared to anything else that I've had in town and at least matches if not exceeds what I've eaten elsewhere. The texture is even more remarkable, with a brilliant crispy exterior that must be tasted fresh. Omnivores and vegans alike will love this.\n\nPita chips ($2.31) were pretty good too, although I only had a bite. No comment on the fountain drinks ($2.59), which I didn't taste at all, but they include an uncommon soda brand and a few house-made blends. I'll consider giving those a try next time.\n\nHUMMUS is not just one of the best adaptations of the customizable bowl model, but they're easily the best casual Mediterranean eats in the local scene. It's cheaper and more satisfying than the \"colorful\" place not too far down Eastern, and it's far superior to the local, \"modern\" Mediterranean chain which has also received Chipotle-esque comparisons. This is worth the drive even if you're clear across town.
