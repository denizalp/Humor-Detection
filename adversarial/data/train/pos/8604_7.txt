Time to make like a bunny and hop hop hop on over to Hop Social Tavern!\n\nWe strolled in one evening after spin class to eat back every single calorie we burned off. Not only that, as over-achievers, we even ate back MORE than what we burned off. We make bad life choices, okay?\n\nI got a Spicy Mac & Cheese. It was a delicious dish of mac & cheese but it wasn't spicy at all. No biggie though because while misleading, it was still a solid dish. I don't need my culo to burn to enjoy my food. I also nabbed a few bites of the Thai Prawn Linguini. That peanut sauce was tasty! I also stole a bite of my friend's Chicken Pot Pie and goodness... it was dang good! Our waitress had told us that it was the owner's mother's recipe. *kisses fingertips* We were also told about how their fried chicken is soaked in buttermilk for hours and other tidbits of facts about their menu.\n\nService was great. I enjoyed parking my spin class abused bum on the squishy booths and the ambiance was just right. I can see myself coming back here again!  3.5 stars but rounding up for the excellent service.
