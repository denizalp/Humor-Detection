We had the wonderful opportunity of attending a wedding and staying at the M Resort and Hotel during spring break and had a wonderful time, as always in Vegas. The hotel is off the strip, and since there wasn't an oyster bar, we decided to try the Studio B Buffet within the resort. The price is reasonable (unlike the Sterling Buffet) and the variety of food is just astonishing, over 200 types of food, all from different parts of the world. \n\nOur server, Silvia (spelling?) was simply wonderful. We didn't feel rushed, nor did we feel neglected. Every time we stepped away, we came back to a clean table. She also provided wet wipes for our snow crab-smelling fingers. Always a smile on her face, Silvia was one of the main reasons for our enjoyable meal. \n\nWe loved the various ways the snow crabs were prepared, from iced to steamed to Chinese stir-fry. The crabs are sliced open so diners don't have to worry about spending so much energy cracking them. The roast beef was so tender and juicy, excellent with the mint julep and creamy horseradish. The bacon near the biscuits and gravy was also crispy and crunchy, one of the best bacon we have tasted. \n\nThere is also unlimited mimosas, beer, juices and sodas. The champagne used for the mimosas must be good quality, as it tasted smooth, indulging and not choppy. Easily the reason why we had five glasses each! \n\nDon't get me started on the dessert section. The gelato was divine, I highly recommend the rum raisin and pistachio. Next time I must save room in my tummy to try their espresso. \n\nThe only thing I feel probably could use down improvement would be the sushi rice. It was cold and hard in texture, fresh rice would of been tastier. Overall, highly recommend Studio B buffet. Extraordinary food selections, friendly and welcoming staff, clean restaurant with giant plasma screen TVs...all at a decent price!
