No no.. Boston Market ? HUH    go back to Boston with your nasty food and prices give me a break 1 piece of chicken 2 spoons  of veg 10 bucks?When I saw 3 Cops eating for free?I know it happens all the time I guess its the \" if we give them free food we will get more protection?\" with plate fulls of Food and by the way they did not need it . I will pay anything but when the food is nasty .. I swear I was praying to the toilet God all night after eating here.. Never again   .Its a great idea.. If the food was not so terrible . \n\nPS   there maybe locations that actually have food that you can eat but,, the few Charlotte NC location are terrible  EAT AT YOUR OWN RISK
