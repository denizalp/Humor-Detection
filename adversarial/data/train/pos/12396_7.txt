Traditionally, a gathering with my Family Relatives would be held at one of the many Cantonese restaurants within the Markham\/Scarborough area.  There's almost never a second thought about it as it usually offers delicious sharable Food at a reasonable price-range while giving everybody that recognizable flavour profile that they grew up on.\n\nThis time around we(I) decided to venture outside the box but considering that Ga Bin Korean is right in the middle of a Chinese plaza, it's not too far a stretch.  What I learned in this instance is that sharing some Korean dishes amongst a larger group has slightly more challenges than Chinese dishes.\n\n#4 on Back Menu.  Selection of items(for Group)\n\nBanchans   -   That Potato Dish is definitely tasty sweet with the texture of Fried Potato while enveloped in some sort of sugar coating almost resembling Maple Syrup in color.  The Dude forgot Kimchi for our table which must be some Korean Sacrilege of some sort while giving us everything else.
