There were a couple entertaining things right in the beginning (like the hula-hoop girl) that gave you the false sense of \"This show might be good\" but overall it was a total bore.  I expected \"sensual\" as they advertised but instead it was just in-your-face childish sex jokes and displays.  It was basically something a pubescent high school boy would get excited over.  Some things, like the woman having fake, pre-recorded orgasms, were just weird and slightly awkward- I'm not kidding.  She was dropped from the ceiling, her body completely wrapped up in sashes and ribbons like a mummy, blindfolded.  There was no lead-up into it; just came out of nowhere from the ceiling.  Then began her violently convulsing to really loud, exaggerated orgasms like she was trying to break free from the sashes and that was her *ENTIRE* bit in the show.  Freaking bizarre.\n\nI'm sorry that we wasted our time and money to watch this.  It also seemed a lot shorter than the other Cirque du Soleil shows I've gone to.  There wasn't any story to it either.  The other ones I've seen all played out with a storyline to it; this one lacked that.  It was just lame sex stuff over and over.  Nothing sensual about it.  Would not recommend it nor watch it again, even if it were free.
