I almost pooped my pants this was such a good time.   Everything you could expect from a bank, nice people taking your money and holding onto it for you.  The ATM is in a good location with a nice interface, drive thru people are nice.  This Wells Fargo is in a pretty convient location right off I-10.  Quick easy transactions, and if you go thru the drive thru with a kid they will give you a sucker.   Would be 5star if they just gave me free money.
