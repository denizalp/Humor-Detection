For the sake of convenience, I took a shuttle between Phoenix and Tucson. Booking the trip is easy enough, you can pick a time and pay online. Don't expect anything fancy, if anything the atmosphere is a little bit TOO casual.\n\nI boarded from terminal 2 at Sky Harbor airport, and had to ask around to find the check-in desk. The website only offered a general area, with a photo of the desk. It had a map of the airport, but a little marker to show their location would be nice. Someone got a little bit lazy there.\n\nAnyways, the shuttle was a little cramped, but I won't complain, as I'm 6'4\". Most of you will be pretty comfortable. My only problem with it was the waiting area coming back from Tucson. It was at a gas station with no desk, just a sign in front of a dumpster in the back that basically said to wait at a bench and the driver will have your receipt when he arrives. \n\nI'll try not to rant. This shuttle service will get you where you need to go in a timely fashion. What else is there to expect?\n\nQuick edit: Price from Phoenix to Tucson is $34 in advance, $40 same day, each way.
