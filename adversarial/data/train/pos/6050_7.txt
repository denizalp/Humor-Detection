Whenever kiddo needs a new pair of shoes, we pop into this Famous Footwear location to buy a pair.  He likes this location because of it's close proximity to ASU and he says \"Dad, the scenery is better at this mall\".....he's 15 and full of hormones.\n\nThe place is clean and offers a nice selection of shoes.  That's why we come here...for the shoes, right?\nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/famous-footwear-tempe-2?select=wht5FaGi7r86WKW7-VX2lQ#wht5FaGi7r86WKW7-VX2lQ\nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/famous-footwear-tempe-2?select=e3KKBu1H7Z9pMEe8NQqXfg#e3KKBu1H7Z9pMEe8NQqXfg\nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/famous-footwear-tempe-2?select=JgxxmRjkyBxDH2-6mlLQlQ#JgxxmRjkyBxDH2-6mlLQlQ\n\nReturn Factor - 100% (at least until kiddo graduations from HS)
