Oy Vey, Orleans\n\nSO WHAT if this place isn't  right on the strip..\n\nSO WHAT if it isn't the newest and trendiest casino & hotel there is...\n\n&& SO WHAT if the time we stayed there two floors were drenched with water from the sprinkler system (faulty system, possibly an arson attempt, or some idiot being dumb)\n\nYEAH, my floor was obviously not effected by the water damage but I'm almost POSITIVE they got compensated with money, stays for the next million years, and freebies galore!!!  But I digress...\n\nYou can catch the shuttle to the strip OR stick around to enjoy the many on-site conveniences like the movie theater, bowling, food court, restaurant dining, and of course the casino & bars! They even have a little spot for live entertainment on the weekends. \n\nSuper old school charm and in need of a makeover. BUT HEY, they gave us a two bedroom suite upgrade with 6 TVs & two bathrooms. That's a thumbs up in my book!
