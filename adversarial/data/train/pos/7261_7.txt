Jenna was so helpful & fantastic.  Not pushy & even explained to another store what my cousin from London was looking for.  Tho  they didn't have his size in the sports coat, & tailor right there at the store, we will be back & I'll refer more men to this store.  It's awesome w\/ classy quality brand names.\n\nI like the whole 'Stitched' feel of seeing the tailor operation there & the merchandise is like eye candy for men.  I'd love to wear a lot in there if in my size, but definitely would love to see other men wearing their variety of styles & shoes!  I love the shoes!\n\nLocated across from the second floor Chandelier Bar & many other restaurants in the Cosmopolitan.  Perfect.
