This used to be a great neighborhood bar\/ restaurant but I'm not sure if they replaced the chef or what happened here.  On our last few visits for dinner, the portions were extremely small and the prices are on the high side.  We were there recently on a Friday night with friends, they ordered the calamari but it was one of the smallest and worst displays of calamari I had seen.  The service is always good so I can't fault them there. But I don't think I will be going back anytime soon, there are too many really good restaurants that are better.
