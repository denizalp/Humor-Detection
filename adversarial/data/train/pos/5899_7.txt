I like world harvest. I go there for cheese, chocolate, pita bread, grains, jam ... that kind of stuff. And its good. They have many things you cannot find elsewhere. However, they WILL sell you rotten food. We bought goat cheese on \"sale\" that was 3 weeks past the sell by date. And I found worms in the rice once. Right there on the shelf with all the other foods. Kind of off-putting. I told the management and they argued that the cheese was totally fine. Um ... maybe, but 3 weeks past the date? They said, \"oh yea, totally fine.\" Unacceptable to receive no compassion for the fact that they sold me 3 week old cheese. Update: the cheese is still on the shelf a week later. A month old. Is that even legal?\n\nTwo years ago, I would have also given this a 5-star rating. Today, just 2. Just stop selling rotten foods. It's THAT easy.\n\nAnd don't eat the falafel sandwich either. Its soggy and gross.
