So there are food to eat in Vegas besides buffets??  Too bad for the first 7 trip or so, most of the food consumed were from the buffet line.  Mistakes made, lessons learned.  Anyways, unlike most of the reviewers here, I went for the lunch buffet as I did not yelp this place beforehand.  In terms of the food, it's probably about a 3.5 star.  It was pretty good, nothing really amazing however.  Yet, since I didn't order off the menu, I don't want to give this place the short end of the stick, so I plan on making this place a return trip when I head back to Vegas in a month or so.  In terms of the buffet for those interested, you have choices of pad thai, fried rice, chicken wings and a few other selections, along with 2 types of soups.  For $8, it was definitely a good deal.  The service was pretty good and our water were always refilled without having to wave down a waiter.\n\nLocated in a fairly deserted mall off the strip, I came here through a friend's recommendation, but I'm definitely coming back for a 2nd to see if this place really deserves the 4 stars I'm giving right now.
