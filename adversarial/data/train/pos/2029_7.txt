Bobo China looks like your typical take out Chinese spot, but on the couple nights we've stopped by there's been several locals dining in. Maybe the draw is the good food or friendly service where the owners seem to know all their customers. Either way, this place is a step up from most other spots of its kind. Beef chow fun ($8.95) was mild in flavor, but still good with plenty of beef, onions, green onions and noodles. Portion sizes for the pan fried noodles were equally as large. Noodles were extra crispy, just how I like it with veggies, chicken and shrimp covered in a light sauce. They also offer combo plates which come with an egg roll, crab rangoon, fried shrimp, and rice. The cashew chicken combo, in particular, was quite good.
