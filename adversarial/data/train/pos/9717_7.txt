How did I only give Z's three stars the first time I was here?  This update is overdue as I have been here 2-3 times since my first review.\n\nThey have been consistently delicious and fresh.  4 star all the way.  The atmosphere is ok, nothing special.  Free wifi is a bonus.  But the quality food makes up for it by far.\n\nThree stars?  What was going on?  I'm going to have to have a talk with myself and get back to you on that.  \n\nThree stars?  \n\nSeriously?
