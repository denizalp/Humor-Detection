This is what I'm talking about...a restaurant that remembers me and asks \"it was you that wrote the review about the volcano, right?\" I was back in there last night, and they let me know that the sushi chef who is the Volcano Master has passed along the knowledge to the other wonderful chef who is there on his days off. VOLCANO 7 days a week now!! So happy...\n\nThank you for being awesome Sushi Bistro Anzu!
