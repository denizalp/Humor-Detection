Samosa King has been here for ages, and yet, their prices still haven't raised for their food. 5 samosas, spring rolls, potato balls for $1, the rolls (has curry inside) are $0.75 each. Roti is $0.50 each. I love getting the curry here, veggie curry is a few dollars cheaper than the meat. Large curry is about $7-$8 for lamb meat. The lamb meat curry usually has more pieces of meat than the curry alone, and is delicious! My whole family and I purchase some bread\/roti from supermarkets to finish the curry, which usually takes a few days. It's absolutely delicious!\n\nThere's two lines, one for hot food and the other for the fried goods\/sweets. If you come here at night, it's usually a long wait ~20min. I came here once on the afternoon on a weekday and I did not have to wait at all for either line. The hot food line serves you the curry, curry with rice and the chicken (usually they let you purchase the roti and samosas in this line as well, but you can always line up, because I saw more items like the spring rolls that I liked as well. \n\nSamosa King should definitely plan to open another cash register, or hire one more employee. There were about 3 employees serving in the hot food line, one compiling the order for the cash register and one employee working the cash register. \n\nAmazing food, definitely worth the wait, I would rather come here than Babu up in Buroak and McCowan.
