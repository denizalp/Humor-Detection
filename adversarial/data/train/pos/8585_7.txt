Thanks for greeting my son tonight and complimenting his choice in movie and his hat Mathieu. You've greeted us on multiple occasions and every time you give great customer service. \nSorry I had to interrupt your conversation about which accent you think is hotter Darryl (supervisor on Aug 18th at 9pm) but when someone shows you their stained white sandals from the gobs of ketchup I walked through getting to my seat - I expect more than directions to the ladies room. \nReplace Darryl with Mathieu and this theatre may not get as many complaints as it does.........seriously - for just one week....see what happens.....
