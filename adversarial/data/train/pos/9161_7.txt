No idea how this place is still in business.  Dad and I came in on a Thursday night.  Our waiter was the cook, bartender, and host.  For two hours, this place was deserted except for us.  A touch suspicious.\n\nI ordered a gnocchi dinner with lobster and crab in Alfredo sauce ($22.95).  There was a plethora of seafood in this dish, although it was not the best gnocchi I have ever eaten.  The Alfredo sauce was also a bit too garlicy because it lacked any other flavoring.  The entree was not bad, but it wasn't the greatest Italian food either.  The fresh bread was good.  However, I was really unimpressed with the salad.  The dressing was overly strong, and there was far too much of it.  Just an ok meal.\n\nIn the future, I will definitely go to the Pleasure Bar over Lombardozzi's.  The food is cheaper and the quality of the Italian food is better.
