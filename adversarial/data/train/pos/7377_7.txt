So a few years ago I was looking for a place to stay on the strip and someone mentioned Ballys and my reaction alternated between repulsion and laughter. Like \"we should go to Jollibee\" kinda laughter.  If you don't know about Jollibee check out my review of the since closed Mira Mesa location. \n\nI digress\n\nWe saw that Ballys had rooms for $29 plus report fee and decided to give it a try, especially since all the M-Life hotels have decided to tack on a parking fee in addition to all of their ridiculousness that they already charge for. Ballys does not so they got the nod!\n\nI seriously couldn't believe what a good week we had at Ballys. The rooms are not going to be like Mandalay Bay or whatever. There is not going to be a high end club and the rest of it is pretty average. But it was definitely solid. The rooms are in good shape and have the basics. The pool is nice. If you're looking for a pool with party style music wtc this is not the scene for you. There was music but it wasn't overpowering the scene. The vibe in the pool was pretty chill. Perfect scene for day drinking and relaxing. \n\nThe best part?  Location!  You're literally in the center of the strip. You can't beat it. Whatever you want to do its right there.\n\nTo be clear, Ballys is not the heart of the party scene. It's conveniently located to get you to the party scene. Plus for $29 it can't be beat. \n\nI took one star off because everyday while we were at the pool the lifeguards decided that when cleaning up the pool chairs they would try throwing them on top of each other and needless to say my passed out self did not appreciate being woken up to the sound of crashing chairs. Seriously?!? Wtf is the point of smashing the chairs into each other? Simmer down there Mr Hulkamaniac. This isn't Wrestlemania 247 or something.
