Two stars is generous, and for the location on the Vegas Strip alone. \n\nSuch a disgusting excuse for a \"4 star hotel,\" according to Priceline. Here's why:\n\n1. Bathroom was a cesspool (hair all over shower walls, moldy-looking residue in corners, tub didn't drain so it was up to my ankles by end of shower, floor visibly dirty). \n2. With all the visible signs of uncleanliness in the bathroom, you really have to wonder about all the things you can't see....\n3. Entire floor smelled strongly of marijuana.\n4. Room was incredibly dated, dank, and not inviting in any sense. If you want a visual: imagine a truck stop motel, then don't change anything. \n5. Customer service sucks. After airing these grievances to Priceline, the hotel staff agreed to refund the $33 resort fee (out of the total $152 for the night). What a joke...\n\nAnyone who claims this hotel is any nicer than 2 stars is probably the same person who hotboxed our entire floor.\n\nI will NEVER make the mistake of returning to this hotel, and recommend you don't either. You have endless better options on the Vegas Strip.
