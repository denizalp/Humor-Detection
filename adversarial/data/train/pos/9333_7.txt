Science meets sweets at Creamistry! Glad to have them in Vegas, though they are safely across town for me. I've still been a handful of times already since they opened, somehow. \n\nBasically, liquid nitrogen is used to make ice cream with your chosen base and mix-ins, then used in a shake, sando, cup, or creation, with your choice of added toppings. Their regular ice cream cups have been my favorite so far, and I recommend splurging for a waffle bowl- they are made in house with a nice chew rather than shattering into shards. The sandwiches are photogenic but the \"buns\" can be tough to chew, and the Creations travel well to grab and go. Pricing reflects shareable portions.\n\nBonus points for having so many flavor options (taro, Thai tea, cotton candy!) as well as vegan choices (coconut milk base). This is a fairly busy plaza but I've had no issues finding parking. \n\nTIP: Go with time, when there's a line things can take a while. Eat fast, seems to melt quick!
