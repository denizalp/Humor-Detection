My review just went from 2 stars to 1 star. I emailed to complain about my experience and heard NOTHING. I then emailed AGAIN explaining how upsetting it was that they couldn't even say a simple 'we're sorry'. This place has to be the absolute worst in customer service. Go give another more deserving hotel your money. One that actually cares about its customer base. I have gotten better treatment at Circus Circus.
