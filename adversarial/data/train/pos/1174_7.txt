Kitchen 56 is a comfortable place to have a meal with drinks. I meet some friends here that are regulars so we did get excellent table service.\n\nI had the Pork Chop served on top of mashed potatoes with red cabbage served on the side. The meal was about $15, a heck of a lot more than you would pay at a Lone Star Restaurant. I thought there was nothing really special about the Pork Chop, it just didn't have that succulent juicy taste that I have come to expect from a Pork Chop. The mashed potatoes and red cabbage were just ok for me.\n\nI have heard that Kitchen 56 has great Happy Hour food specials. So I would probably return if in the area during Happy Hour.
