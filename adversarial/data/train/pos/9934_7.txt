Lemon zest?  On a pizza?  \n\nYeah, I wasn't sure if I was going to like it.  I decided to put my faith in LGO to create a wonderful pizza experience.  And that they did!  My final verdict; the Avocado Pizza is heavenly!  The creamy avocado, sweet tomatoes, summery basil, bright lemon zest, and add in the salty prosciutto and you have yourself a pretty tasty pizza.  The best part is that you don't see that kind of pizza on the menu everywhere you go. \n\nThe even better part is the sourdough crust!!  So delicious!  All of their pizza creations sound amazing.  I can't wait to try them all!  A few more tries and I easily see a fifth star in their future.\n\nIt did take us a few minutes to figure out the lunch flow of the place.  \n- Order your food on the grocery side, \n- find your own table on the pizzeria side, \n- wait for your sandwich on the grocery side,\n- listen for your pizza on the pizzeria side,\n- ask for more ice at the coffee stand,\n- fill your ice tea at the table at the doorway between the two\n- go back to the grocery side to pick your dessert from the case (trust me, you do not want to skip this step!)\n\nIn addition to the wonderful pizza and the lunch with great friends, LGO also provided a bright spot in my day by putting one of my favorite (hard-to-find) red wines right by the cashier for $10 less than I usually get it at AJ's.  Score!!
