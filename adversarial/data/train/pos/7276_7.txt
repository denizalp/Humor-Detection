Everything was good until the drop off.\nI booked the car on carrental.com for $10.90 a day but once I picked-up the car it was $21 a day....\nI paid 70$ and returned the car 25h aftet and they asked me to pay another 62$ because they don't do hourly rate.\nWell I told them that I booked the car for 10.80 a day w\/o insurance so how is it possible to pay 132$ ? They refunded me the extra 62$ so check ur online rate and the one that they give u carefully when u pick up the car.\n\nUPDATE !!!!\n1months after the rental I have been charged on my credit card 650$ + 49$ \nMy bank is looking at those transactions under this company.\n\nUpdate 2 ... July 2014\nAfter more than 6 months I finally got my money back from the bank unfortunately the garage got the 650$ but my bank sent me some bills from them with my signature on it !!!! I didn't give them any right to do that so I guess they scanned my signature from the credit cart print that they took ... Ppl be careful there.
