I called it.  When places first open up, a new staff is excited and all the corporate knob-slobbers are still in town to make the place look polished a place cannot be beat.  Fast forward a few months and its already the \"B\" team working here for the most part.  Some are good, but not all.  They are constantly out of hot food.  I came at 2pm, mind you.  FILTHY tables.  Lettuce at salad bar was empty and the poor lady was told \"10 minutes\"....for lettuce.  Nobody seems to give  damn anymore.  Stuff only gets cleaned, stocked unless its brought up.  And even then it takes forever.  For some reason the beer is always stocked and pulled foreword.  Probably because the beer reps are there making sure the small retail space they have looks spiffy.  Now we need a salad rep, a hot mac n cheese rep and a clean table rep and this stuff can get done.  The honeymoon is over, folks...
