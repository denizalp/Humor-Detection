Every trip I've taken to this DMV has taken at least 3 hours. And no, I don't come here for routine stuff like registration renewal when that task can be accomplished through a DMV kiosk at my local Albertson's. I only come here when I absolutely positively have to. On my most recent trip to the DMV, I was finally getting a Nevada DL. You would not believe the hoops they make out-of-state residents jump through to get an ID! Did you want my soul too? \n\nAnyways, everyone is parading around the new DMV Dash Pass system. I mean, it's an improvement, and it's the only reason I gave the DMV two stars instead of one. Regardless, I had to stand in the line to check in for over 1 hour! 1 hour people, just to even get into the Dash Pass system. The line stretched outside in the sizzling heat and wrapped around the corner of the building. I tried checking in online. Nope, system was down and\/or they were not accepting check-ins at that time. So I finally get to the counter, the lady takes my cell number, and sends me on my merry way. The text says to come back in 2+ hours. The benefit of the Dash Pass is that you can hold your place in line without having to be physically present at the DMV.\n\nI showed up as instructed and waited around 20 minutes. I get some forms checked off at the booth and I'm sent to yet another line to get my picture taken. All in all, I show up around 12PM and don't leave the DMV until 5PM. Way to waste a day of my life! BTW, I've experienced California DMVs and never been there longer than an hour. You suck Nevada DMVs.\n\nYELP 100 CHALLENGE 2015: #172
