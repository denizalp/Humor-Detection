Took a spontaneous trip to the Hoover Dam, since I've never seen it before. Was really hungry and decided to see what Yelp can suggest to help my hunger LOL. And we decided on this cute little place on the side of the road. It was a beautiful day outside so we chose to sit outside. They do not have a lot of seating for outside maybe like 4-5 tables. The staff here is very friendly and the food was delicious. I would definitely come here during the weekend just to enjoy the weather and the food.
