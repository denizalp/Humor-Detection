I went there again to give it another go. This time, no big difference other than we got a table and I got to talk to one of the bar backs and I asked him why they always seemed like they were running around like crazy. He explained that: \"THEY WEREN'T ALLOWED TO WALK. THEY HAD TO RUN!!!\" Can you believe that shit!!!??!!!! No wonder they don't give a shit if you're in their way...They will run you over with their lemons, lime, and ice bucket.\n\nOhh...and their dancefloor is insanely crowded. I mean, most dancefloors are crowded but...for some reason this was extremely hard to dance\/walk in...I think cuz it's in such a small enclosed area.\n\nAND another thing -- there's little or no cell phone reception in there! If you lose someone, consider yourself fucked. HA.
