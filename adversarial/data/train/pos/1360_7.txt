I have to say that I was very unhappy with my experience tonight.\n\nWhen we walked in, there was a 25 minute wait, which was fine. I gave my name and number and luckily I was called back within 15 minutes.\n\nWe waited about 35 to 40 minutes for our food. My ramen was incorrect and I told them. The waiter quickly said that I was given the wrong ramen, delivered the ramen to the other guest and delivered me my ramen, which was good \n\nbut the waiter did not at any time apologize for the mistake. I understand that people make mistakes but the least they can do is say sorry. \n\nOne star for the service and the second star is because the ramen is good and that the other waiter noticed we were waiting for a long time and went to check on our order.
