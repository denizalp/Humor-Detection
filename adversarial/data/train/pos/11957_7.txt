It's like Richmond Court and Terre Rouge had a baby!\n\nCame with a 6 top, ordered over half the menu to taste.\n\nApparently water is first come first serve as our two early bird medal winners were blessed with goblets of water while the rest of us are condemned to a full blown dining experience in the Sahara desert. Thank goodness the food was mostly underseasoned or I'd have really felt the damage when my tongue turned into jerky. Jerky which would have probably still tasted decent in comparison to the blessed by the devil seafood paella dish with spam and dried up rancid mussels.\n\nTo say that the experience was underwhelming would be invalid as one server placed and left an overwhelmingly large tray containing a small tea pot + a biscotti on our table which would have figuratively parted the red sea. Fortunately our food had not arrived yet, or we would have had to balance the dishes on our heads because god forbid we suggest the idea of not using ridiculously large gimmick trays.\n\nThis was originally a 2 star review that was going to be more elaborate. But thinking back on all of this has got me fuming.
