We had one of the high end suites and my god, this place is classy! We had our own private entrance and elevators. Definitely felt where the dollars went! The room was $2300 or so per night and it had 3 tv's and an 8 to 10 person dining table, wet bar and two bathrooms. The view was toward the strip and it was spectacular! The concierge was very nice and the hookers were top of the line (lol JK about the last part).\n\nThe only place to stay IF:\n1. You are a baller\n2. You want to feel like a baller\n3. You just took out 5 credit cards just to stay here\n4. All of the above
