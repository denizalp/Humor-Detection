Wow! I'm shocked that this place has landed so many stars. I guess I'm not a tourist attraction type of gal cuz this place did nothing for me. To give it credit, the wax models are done well and the interactive aspect was entertaining but it was all a bit creepy.  So if you are into taking pictures of lifelike clones made of wax, you'll enjoy this place. For me? not so much.
