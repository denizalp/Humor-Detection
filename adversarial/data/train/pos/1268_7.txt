I have like six buttons to program on my radio in the car and when I'm done with the news I can always switch to 93.1 to listen to pop hits and Top-40. \n\nI like that they play the latest songs too, unlike back home where you hear the same songs over and over.  You should tune in too if you want to hear \"On the Air\" with Ryan Seacrest,  that's always a good escape!
