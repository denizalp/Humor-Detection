First time at Olive and Ivy, second time in Scottsdale. I visited a year ago for a dirty ass bachelor party that did not entail beautiful brunches and extravagant dinners haha. \n\nGreat ambiance, attentive service, trendy, and a great effin food. We had the prosciutto cudo flatbread which had the obvious, Rosemary mashed- like potato, basil, and a sunny-side egg on top. We also had the lamb gyro which was really really tasty and the portions were extremely generous. We are both fatties and walked away more than satisfied. I highly recommend both dishes. As for the drinks, we had the bloody and the greyhound. Both were super good and strong. Check it out!
