Sushi 101 was both a slight disappointment and a pleasant surprise. Lets start with this criticism sandwich with the tasty part, the $5 lunch special. For five bucks, I received a giant bento box filled with hot and fresh tempura veggies, a combination of thinly sliced beef and teriyaki chicken, a side salad with ginger dressing, miso soup, and a side of corn in a light soy dressing.\n\nThe tempura was top notch, crispy flakey batter and generously portioned. This was the best part of the box and and potentially worth $5 alone. I really felt like this was a steal to get all the classic japanese flavors for so little cash. The salad and corn were both fresh and well seasoned, but basic. I'll be back for their cooked items as long as they keep offering them at this price.\n\nThe downside was the sushi. The eel and avocado roll was stuffed with filler fake crab, and only the slightest bit of eel. What little eel made it in to the roll was fatty while the avocado was on the overly ripe side. This joint loves to put filler crab in a lot of their rolls so watch out. Spicy tuna was also underwhelming; not enough spice and the tuna was pulverized to a mushy texture. It was obviously overworked and was not pleasant. I prefer my \"spicy\" roll fish cut in to small cubes, and gently mixed with seasoning to preserve structural integrity and maximum flavor. The rice was also second rate, either there was not enough vinegar or a general lack of freshness. The sushi prices were reasonable, so I guess you get what you pay for,\n\nService was spot on, and our food came quick during a slow lunch hour. In a bizarre twist, they have an attractive wait staff and play Frank Sinatra. Check them out for their bento, and skip the sushi.\n\n-3.5\/5-
