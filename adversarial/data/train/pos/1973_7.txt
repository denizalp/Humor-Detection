The salsa is so hot that you'll be hating life the next day with a burning chocolate starfish. Waiters are jerky and the food is way to salty.. I think they want you to buy more of their over priced drinks!\n\nThey lost the Mr.'s Amex on the last visit and got really bitchy with him because he was upset. Ended up calling Amex and reporting the card stolen and didn't pay for dinner. With that we will never return. However up to that point we had always had a good time there even though its mediocre at best.
