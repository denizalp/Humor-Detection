When in Vegas...\n\nThat's exactly how my crew and I felt about In-N-Out on our last day in Vegas. Considering we can't get it in the East Coast, we knew we had to make this our final destination. So we stopped here for lunch right before heading to the airport and let me tell you, it was worth the hustle. \n\nIn-N-Out out burgers are pretty darn GOOD. They are so fresh and juicy. I'd recommend ordering your hamburger\/cheeseburger\/double-double Animal style off of their special menu which includes extra Thousand Island, mustard, grilled onions, and extra pickles. Yes, it will add some extra cals to your meal but it is definitely worth it so just do the damn thing! \n\nThe fries are a little disappointing. Nothing to hate about them, but they are so basic when compared to the burger. If you're trying to sacrifice something from your meal, skip the fries, or maybe ask for Animal style fries as well!\n\nThe line was huge and wrapped around the entire restaurant, but the staff worked quickly and efficiently. We were cutting it pretty close to our flight time, but our burgers were ready just moments after ordering. \n\nI don't have any Vegas trips planned for the rest of the year, but l'll definitely go to this location again next time I'm there. It's so close to the airport and makes for the perfect stop to grab some food before heading back home!
