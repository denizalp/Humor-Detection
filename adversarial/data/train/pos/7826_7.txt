Worst place I've ever bowled!!!! I went there with a friend for their birthday, paid for the lane, then a friend was smoking and the manager who wasn't wearing a badge kicked us out. The guy who claimed to be a manager was rude, didn't explain what the rules were, and stole our money by turning off the lanes because two of twelve people were smoking, as they were moving to the bar as he asked. Even though he wasn't wearing a badge. Worst service ever!!!! Don't go there!!!
