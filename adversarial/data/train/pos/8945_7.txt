Say what now? There's a 3rd Caffe Rosso location? There sure is!\n\nAwesomeness:\n- The red chandelier hanging by the register. When you walk in the door, look up.\n- The staff. They remember my drink orders! I've only been in a handful of times so far.\n- The hours. Open later! Like, 9pm instead of 5 like the other two locations.\n- Liquor permit! Yep, you can buy beer here too.\n- The setup. I enjoy the mixture of large communal table, bar style seating and other tables for me and my friends.\n- Free wifi! \n- Savoury cheese scones. You must try one.\n- Patio. Yay patio! It's licensed too... and it faces north, so during ridiculous hotness, you can be totally shaded :)\n\nPoints I'm less fond of:\n- the number of plug ins. There are only two. I keep managing to sneak into the table in the corner, but one of these days somebody else is going to be in there, my laptop will be near dead and instead of hanging out longer and drinking more coffee, I'll have to move elsewhere. Although that may be a good thing... getting me out to stretch my legs a little more.\n- The little counters against the wall. I tried to set myself up there with my laptop on my very first visit so I wouldn't hog one of the larger tables just for me and my computer. Turns out it didn't fit and was too awkward to sit at. \n- Table and chairs. They're a little large... or maybe there are just too many of them? It's a bit awkward squeezing by people to pull one out for yourself when it's a bit busier.\n\nVerdict: Go try the new Caffe Rosso location. Eat a cheese scone. If you're planning to camp out for a bit and get some work done, make sure your battery is well charged or that you're headed in during a slump (it's common coffee shop courtesy anyway to avoid hogging valuable coffee shop space. We laptoppers can work anywhere. Literally!) And don't forget to grab your coffee punch card. You'll be back for more. I promise!
