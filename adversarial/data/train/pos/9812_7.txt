Sears Vacations is a great investment IF you take vacations regularly. If you don't take vacations often, it would not be a good investment because that is the service you are buying.. Duh!\n\nTo silence some of the negative feedback... \n--They did not need your credit card, they needed two forms of ID (bring a D\/L & Passport if you like)\n--No kids at the at the sales meeting (good idea). You are looking into an investment and distractions and not good to have around. It is also not courteous to the others attending.\n--the cost of the membership is really nothing more than upfront payment for the vacations you are given for joining and you get great deals on all the additional vacations you take during the year for as long as you have your membership.\n\nThe travel agents I have spoken with are great and their customer service is outstanding, which has been a trademark for Sears for decades.\n\nI am retiring soon and plan on taking more vacations than I do now and this will make it even cheaper. I do a moderate amount of business traveling and vacationing and this will allow me to either save money for other things or go on more vacations.  \n\nIn short, if you don't travel because you (1. Struggle with the funds. 2. Don't like traveling) then this might not be for you as it will not turn you into a frequent traveler if you don't already travel. If you do travel (1-week trips, 4-day weekends, cruises) moderately or a lot, this is a fantastic way to save money and\/or go on more trips.\n\nLast thing.... Your membership is for your immediate family, not just you (Mom, Dad, brothers, sisters, and kids)! My daughter is using it in two weeks on a 3-day trip to San Diego and is not paying nearly what she would have using any of the travel websites.  Vacations recharge our batteries!  Bon Voyage!
