As a lot of other reviewers have pointed out, in relation to other huge parks in Orlando and Cedar Point in Ohio, Carowinds is a bit weak, but if you live within driving distance of Charlotte, then it's an awesome option for a fun summer day trip. And if you live in Charlotte, then you're nuts not to buy a season pass, and here's why.  If you go just twice, you'll have saved money on your second time in. Plus, with the season pass, you get free parking all summer, so it's worth it for that alone as well.  \n\nAs for the rides, the best by far is the Intimidator, named after Dale Earnhardt, so it's themed accordingly.  It's a good ride at any park, with a steep drop off at the start, and a lot of air time during the ride.  When we go, we usually ride it at least 3-4 times. The line moves really quickly too, so if you see a long line don't be discouraged, it's usually not more than 20 mins to ride.  The other rides are ok, I forget all the names, but the one where you lay on your stomach superman style is cool, but the line takes forever, so it's not really worth it more than once.  The other really good one is the Top Gun ride, but sit in the front row if you can, it's a 1000% times better from there.\n\nAll the other gripes are standard for a theme park, yes, it's stupid expensive for food and snacks, people working there aren't in love with their jobs, shocking since they're a bunch of teenagers working for the summer! But if you want a fun way to get the blood pumping, this is a pretty sweet resource right in Charlotte's back yard.
