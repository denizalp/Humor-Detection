Literally just left Tacos Chiwas and needed to write a review. \n\nCOME HERE!! \n\nAll the tacos were so savory and made to order! Definitely order at least one taco chiwa. You'll want five more after it, trust me. The beans that they serve are amazing! You'll want more of those too. Salsa bar was my favorite part. I want one of those things in my house. \n\nCustomer service was great. They checked on us twice and asked if we enjoyed the food.
