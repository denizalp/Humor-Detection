OK, the Plain Dealer is slightly better than the San Francisco Chronicle, which I also gave one star, and clearly worse than the L.A. Times, which I gave two stars, so this rating is my best estimation and in no way should it intimate that this is one of the worst newspapers in the country.\n\nAnyway, the Plain Dealer isn't good.  I appreciate its name, which took me a few months to figure out (I initially thought it was the Plains Dealer and wondered how Cleveland was considered part of the Great Plains) and which gets some props because it doesn't have the name of the city in its title, which is a rarity in major-city newspapers.  Beyond the name, it's a snarky kind of provincial rag.  Now, I will admit that its provinciality is authentic; that is, although I personally disagree with a lot of the paper's political stands, these stands do fit Clevelanders' political opinions generally, so the paper is representative, which is much more than you can say for a lot of papers.\n\nBut it's bad too.  I used to read the first and Northeast Ohio sections every day, and I usually just wanted to grab the writers by the shoulders, shake them a little, and take them on an all-expenses-paid trip to somewhere they hadn't been--somewhere like Indiana, or Pittsburgh, or Elmira.  Cleveland is small town, but it doesn't need to be this small town.
