Let's start by saying I don't (typically) like car dealerships or car sales guys. If I walk in to browse, I usually make every effort to avoid talking to sales people. With that said, I'm pleasantly surprised by the experience we had at Audi Chandler. Jorge assisted us with the purchase of a S3 and we couldn't be happier! \n\nBefore getting into details of the purchase, I think it's important to acknowledge Jorge and his professionalism. He's unlike any car sales guys we've ever met. He is very sweet, seemed genuinely interested in helping us, and didn't force us to make a quick decision. He took sufficient time to explain our trade value, the vehicle itself, and our purchase options. Maybe he can give the \"grand pop\" style cut throat sales guys at all dealerships a lesson ;) \n\nThe purchase:\nWhen we stopped in to look at cars during Labor Day weekend, we had little to no intention to buy on the spot. However, we were pretty blown away by the customer service from Jorge, the trade in value, received, and the quick process! We initially left the dealership without purchasing as we promised our selves we wouldn't make an impulse decision. Yet, we came back within hours to finalize the deal. \n\nOnce we came back, we were able to finalize the deal quickly and schedule a time for Ryan to come back and drop off his old car \/ pick up the S3. We were also able to get an extended warranty + all season mats.\n\nI think we've found our lifetime dealership! This was an incredible experience, thank you!
