Since switching my dog over to this vet I have been really pleased with the services provided and how fair the prices are. My dog needed stitches removed and some other things checked out and Dr. Fields patched her right up. He was very courteous and answered all of my questions. I'd suggest making an appointment because they take walk-in customers and from what I observed the people walking in without an appointment had to wait up to 1 hour because of us others who had appointments. Real cool they honor us with appointments and get us in close if not right at the scheduled time. If it's an emergency I could see why you'd just show up..... but dude if it's for routine things like shots or exams then save yourself some trouble and wait time and just schedule it. You can go online and setup an account so you can schedule appointments and see what your pet is due for. Parking lot gets packed and maneuvering in and out of a parking space when it's busy isn't the funnest but I do know that my dog feels good about coming here and she's happy and healthy.
