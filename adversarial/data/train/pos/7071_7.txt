Met up with friends here before heading to the High Roller. \n\nIt was pretty hot out so walking in was a breath of fresh air...mainly because the AC was blowing haha. Upon entering you're greeted by the staff behind the counter. From here it's choose your flavors. The flavors chosen were coffee, hazelnut and L'Inimitabile. Each were refreshing especially with the heat. The best of the three was the L'Inimitabile which leaned more towards a chocolate flavor with a hint of hazelnut. From tasting the hazelnut gelato, I was able to notice the hazelnut within the L'Inimitabile. The coffee gelato was pretty good as well. Coffee fans will be pleased.\n\nTasting these flavors has prompted me to make a return on a future Vegas trip. I'll be aiming for fruit based gelatos next visit. Possibly caramel as well. \n\nSnack 3\/18\/2017
