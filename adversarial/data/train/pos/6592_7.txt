A great little place, that looks like a house.  It probably was a house back in the good ole days. \n\nOne day my subordinates, and a speech therapist and myself was driving around looking for lunch after an intensely boring training for work.....after 12 minutes of driving we stumble upon this place.  We were very sceptical about this place at first, but we are adventurers and adventurers don't back down from an opportunity and decided to give this place a shot. \n\nThe food was excellent for the price, The place was very clean and very homey, since it was probably a house way back when.  The place was well lite and decorated and was just very inviting.  The staffs were super friendly, even when they screwed up one of our orders they promptly fixed it and let us keep the wrong order for free and lived up to their mistakes.  We like it when staffs admit to their mistakes, makes them more human since it's normal for humans to make mistakes...for that, this error was not an error at all :) and we didn't hold it against them. \n\nOverall we had an excellent experience and we will be back!  I rarely give out 5 stars  but they earned it.
