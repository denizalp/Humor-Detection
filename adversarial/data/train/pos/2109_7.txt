Good food and a good selection of ciders. Our group sampled quote a few ciders, but the clear winner on the evening was Oaked & Wild. There where some sweeter ciders, a few dry, and a couple effervescent.\n\nThe server was attentive, and he even brought over a small sample of the Rose cider for us to try. \n\nWe enjoyed the very tasty food notably the stinging nettled\n\nThis is an especially fun place to take a group.
