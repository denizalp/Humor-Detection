The definition of \"hidden gem\", and its not really that hidden. I have to admit, this little strip looks a little scary. But once you get inside, its a whole other world.\n\nThe decor is very cool. Its made to look like a little village w\/ pieces from Bosnia all over the place. We were seated at a large booth in the back. Our server was wonderful. He was extremely attentive and was more than happy to chat w\/ us and answer our questions.\n\nThe menu is full of very warm, homey food. Sausages, and bread and stew and man, it is cheap! I decided on the stew (and it was not small). It was warm and flavorful and reminded me of something my grandfather would make that his mother would make for him. Lots of tender meat, root veggies and even some cabbage. It came w\/ a large warm piece of bread. And im not ashamed to say i used it to clean my plate. It was a good amount of food. For $5.45. Yup, super cheap. Didnt I say that?\n\nThe really disappointing thing about this place is that we were the only table. Otherwise the restaurant was dead. It made me so sad! Their food is amazing!\n\nGo here, and tell your friends to go here too.
