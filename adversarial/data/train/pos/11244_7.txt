I came here solely for the reason I was desperate to get wet and wear a skimpy bathing suit. Sadly, it was off season and only two slides were open. Regardless, I still had so much fun on those two slides and I will definitely come back during the on season to try all of the slides! \n\nI visit family here in Arizona and drive from Orange County, California; this is a definite stop for visitors.
