My first King of Pops! And the crowd goes wild! So I played it safe and got Strawberry Lemonade. Why? Because I can see the future. After my first two bites, I smiled and savored the fresh strawberry and lemon flavors. After my third bite, my kids commandeered the remaining Popsicle and literally ran away with it.\n\n \"Drat!  I would have gotten away with it too, if it weren't for you meddling kids!\" - every bad guy from Scooby Doo. \n\nWith 20\/20 hindsight, I should have gotten a more exotic flavor but from what I hear, they're all so damn good it wouldn't have made a difference. King of Pops, the $3 adult Popsicle that kids love to steal....
