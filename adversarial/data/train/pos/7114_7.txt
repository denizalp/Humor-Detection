If Field of Dreams was never made, \"Build it and they will come\" would have been coined to describe the Chinese Buffet. Just about anywhere you build one of these babies, people come out of the woodwork to eat. And eat they do. It's like people don't realize what a buffet is, and that they can go back more than once. The artwork that goes into stacking pile after pile onto the plate is simply incredible.\n\nRegardless, the selection here isn't particularly outstanding, and nothing you won't find at any of another couple dozen buffets anywhere else in the Charlotte metro. The difficult part is getting to this one - it's on the opposite side of I-85 from the rest of Concord\/Kannapolis, so it might take you an extra minute, and then it's down in a hole.\n\nThere isn't really any service to speak of, except when it comes to clearing your plate and presenting your check with the stale fortune cookie.
