Totally sufficient for a day\/overnight stay.  I had a 10 hour layover (yikes) into CPH (Copenhagen)  here and got a great day rate until 6pm, more than enough time.  I just wanted to nap, do work, shower and head back to the airport and total experience was fine.  \n\nShuttle back to the airport not an issue, service not an issue.  It's a typical Hotel Indigo and for the rate and responsiveness of staff, Am fine with it.\n\nVisits:  1\n\nTip:  This is a good if not great alternative to sitting at the airport for 10 hours if you want a bed and real shower.  Always ask for the quietest room when you stay by any airport, they have those.   This hotel is a few miles from the airport.   I got a quiet room and slept great!!!    The day rate is negotiated when you call in.  Be aware though whenever you bid a Priceline discount room, you will get the worst room in the hotel:  it is what it is.
