I have been renting from AZ Elite for almost 5 months now and they have been GREAT!  Bobby Kline is my PM, he's super attentive and takes care of everything right away. He's very fair and really cares about me as a tenant. They were even pretty understanding when I had some recent financial issues, which really surprised me.  The home we're in wasn't perfectly  maintained prior to signing with AZ Elite, so any issues we've had related to prior management were understood and handled FAIRLY (shocker right?!).\n\nI've been with the bad property management companies in the past (I'm talking about you PRS!!) so I was prepared for what could go wrong in the PM-Tenant relationship, but so far it has been nothing but cooperation and attentiveness.  I HIGHLY recommend Bobby Kline at Arizona Elite Properties!!
