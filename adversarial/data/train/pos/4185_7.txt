If you are looking for a restaurant for a romantic dinner for two or a birthday celebration with friends...then I strongly recommend Inferno located in Little Italy. The interior of the restaurant is simply beautiful...wooden decor and dim lighting is stunning. Once you settle into the resto , you will be warmly greeted and experience excellent service. Then comes the food which is amazing...beautifully presented dishes  packed with such great Mouth-watering flavors. What is unique about this resto is that their menu changes every 2 weeks...which will keep you coming back for more tasting of great dishes!  Will definitely go back!
