An update to this review Jan 28 2017... car2go sent me a citation for picking up a car parked in a fire route and insisted it was me who left it there. I tried resolving this matter with them and all they did was they will waive the citation fee of $25 of a $250 ticket which I should not be responsible for in the first place. \n\nSorry car2go but just because you have increased costs from getting parking tickets like no tomorrow doesn't mean you can try to recoup the costs from customers. You have lost a loyal customer and I will never use your service again.
