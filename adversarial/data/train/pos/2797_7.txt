Yo, I love donuts. I want to give this 5 stars but that would speak mostly to the fact that I love donuts. The donuts here are no exception. Light (HAHAHA! what an illusion), fluffy, and fresh-tasting even though they're not made on-site. For all I care, they could make them on the moon.\n\nTim Hortons donuts seem to regularly undergo treatment under a shrink ray. On the other hand, hip local bakeries fancify and overprice, with their $4 Garam Masala Mojito Rosewater Balsamic varieties. Krispy Kreme, in its utterly corporate and un-Canadian glory, produces good old-fashioned fried dough holes which are not only reasonably priced, but still very much visible to the human eye. It's enough to make a grown woman cry as well as visit the dentist.\n\nWe're down to two Krispy Kremes in Toronto and I'm losing sleep at night worrying about the remaining locations shutting down. Do your part.
