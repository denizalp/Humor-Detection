Located past the exit of the Red Rock Loop on SR 159, Oak Creek is a scenic trail that's easy to access and involves no fee to enjoy.  If you're looking to enjoy the Great Outdoors and add some cardio into your day, this beats the dreadmill hands down.  It's not strenuous at all as the trail is mostly flat, but a rocky one, so watch your step.  You have great views of Red Rock as well as encounter cholla, Joshua trees, Yucca, and more rocks.  The creek was flowing well when I went with Debbie N. this past weekend and that sound of running water is so relaxing.  You can basically follow the trail as far as your legs and stamina will take you.  Great choice for people of all ages and easy to navigate.
