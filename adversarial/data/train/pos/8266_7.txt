Just finished having dinner here with family on a Thursday evening. There were diners scattered around, but otherwise not that busy. \n\nOur server was friendly, attentive, and had a nice sense of humor. It didn't take long for our food to be served. \n\nLooking at the menu, it seems like it's a bit pricey.. But when the food comes out, you'll see that the servings are HUGE. Like, not even kidding. I forgot what it's called exactly, but I got a single party burger with cheddar cheese and bacon cheddar mash potatoes. Everything was cooked well and tasted good. But I was a little full having just snacked a little while earlier. Before our food came out, they gave us HUGE biscuits with honey butter and and some kind of peach jam. OoOh carbs. The honey butter created a yummy glaze, I asked for more on the side!... \n\nThe hash house in my hometown is crazy busy.. So it's cool to eat here without getting stuck in an 1hr + wait list...
