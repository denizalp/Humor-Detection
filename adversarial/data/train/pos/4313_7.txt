I agree, the hype isnt worth it either. So we went on a Sunday night, the lineup was huge but I was expecting that. I managed to keep my kids contained with eye-spy and people watching. B.B. offered misters and a big jug of cold water. There werent many cups left and the water was nearly empty. The outside tables were dirty. We finally snaked our way inside & got to see our ice cream & cookie choices. Hmmmm. :-\/ i wasnt impressed. I would say there was about 5 staff working out front taking customers. See pics of the menu, maybe 5 or 6 different kinds of cookies and about 10 flavors of ice cream. Meh. I ordered single cones for my kids and a single (not sandwich) red velvet cookie with a scoop of rocky road ice cream. The cookie LOOKED tasty but had a weird after taste. The same with the ice cream. Maybe all the high quality non-gmo food I've been eating for past couple of months has destroyed me for cheap preservative laden ice cream\/cookies but I couldnt finish my desert. It just didnt taste right to me. They were missing something in the mix? I just dont know. The restaurant was dirty, with spills and trash on the tables and floor, the trash cans were full and the water jug inside was almost empty too. Someone needs to be circling the restaurant to keep the place clean even when its busy. I would say this place would be a matter of personal taste for each yelper. The deserts look big and amazing but to me the combination of a dirty restaurant and mediocre food just wasnt worth the hype. Btw the bathrooms were predictably thrashed as well, but if they cant keep the restaurant clean then how could they keep the bathrooms clean? 'Nuf said.
