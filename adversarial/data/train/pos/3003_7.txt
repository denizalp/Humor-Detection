After making an appointment  and arriving on time. I sat in the lobby for one and one half hours before my truck was even put on lift. I was then told my tire that I brought the truck in for could not be patched, they would need to replace it, as it was getting (NEAR) the wear bars and they would not guarantee the work.  I would also have to sign a waiver of liability, if I don't replace it today! I've got to quit coming here they aways find more wrong and inflate the prices to at least twice what it would cost else where. Just remember if you do choose to be ripped off buy Sands Chevorlet, show up a least an hour and a half before your appointment to get in by your appointment time. \nNext be prepared to bend over when the bill come as it will be loaded with up charges and disposal fees...  one star was given because zero is not an option....
