Save your time! Save your money! Save your eyes and save your palette! Be sure to bring good company, because that is the only way you'll endure the understaffed poor service, mediocre food and completely mismatched decor\/styling of this restaurant.  Cut your check in half and get better food and service by visiting a \"-Bertos\" restaurant. I will not be visiting this place again anytime soon nor would I recommend it.
