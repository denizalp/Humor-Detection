I am looking for a place to have my engagement ring reset. I found the Anne Sportun site and loved the jewelry on the site. I called ahead to make sure that they do jewelry re-design and was assured that they do. \n\nI visited the store with my husband and tried on a few of the rings early last Saturday afternoon. I was really excited as the style was exactly what I was looking for and enthusiastically told the woman helping me. I started asking questions about whether my stone would fit particular settings, etc. The woman helping me was unbelievably rude. Her answers were curt and un-helpful, and she was clearly trying to rush us out for some reason. She told me that my stone would not fit any of the settings, they had nothing to show that would fit my stone, and she couldn't help me anyway without seeing my stone. Lastly, when I asked how much my favorite design would cost by itself without the centre stone, she told me she had no idea how much the diamond cost so she couldn't tell me. I left the store within five minutes in total shock and dismay. I will not be back.
