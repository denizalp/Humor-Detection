There are times in your life when you raise the white flag and decide not to argue.\n\nYour boss buying pizza from Pizza Pan for everyone at lunch when you forgot to pack a lunch and you are light on money is one of those moments.\n\nThe pizza pan gimmick is BOGO (buy one, get one free). All the time. This is why they charge $18 for an XL one item pizza. \n\nThe pizza is pretty mediocre. The crust is doughy. The cheese is mozzarella but tasted a bit funky like the cheese on a grade school cafeteria pizza. As KK mentioned, it's greasy and generic. \n\nIf you want to treat yourself or guests better, go elsewhere. \nI was thisclose to making it a one star review, but I ate the pizza because I was hungry.
