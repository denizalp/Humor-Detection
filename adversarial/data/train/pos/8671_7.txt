Rooms:  The rooms are fine (we had a \"two bedroom\" which is one real bedroom suite and one smaller room with a Murphy bed, connected via doors similar to connecting rooms in a hotel).  There is a small kitchen in the suite, and a tiny kitchenette (mini-fridge, sink, microwave, and coffee maker) with the Murphy bed.  The finishings were not luxurious, but we weren't expecting luxury.  It was a nice room for the price.  \n\nPool:  Rooftop and about the size of a bathtub. \n\nLocation:  We were told it was \"off strip\" but were pleasantly surprised to find that it is right near Planet Hollywood.  It was much more convenient than I had expected, and there are several convenience stores a few buildings away.  I think there is a grocery store nearby, but we didn't look for it... no one wanted to cook!\n\nOther:  We were guests of a timeshare owner, and my husband and I thought we'd sit through a presentation for a $100 giftcard.  This was a terrible decision.  No one \"pre-qualified\" us (meaning that no one had us sign a form stating that we were married and both partners were present and that we have an income in excess of $60k\/year), and in the middle of the presentation we were told very loudly, in front of many other  people, that we \"did not qualify\" and that we \"were not eligible\" to sit through the presentation.  So after some headache, we got that sorted out and got a new salesman, who was really nice... until he started to regale us with tales of his animal abuse!  It was a truly strange and awful experience.  Needless to say, we left without buying.  If this is how they treat potential buyers, I would hate to see how they would treat an owner with a problem!  \n\nOverall:  The rooms were fine but the customer service was appalling.
