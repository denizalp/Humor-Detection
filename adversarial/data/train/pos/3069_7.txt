I work in the area so I pretty much check out any new place serving lunch.  Walked into this place today and had a seat.  Wanted to see what was up with the wide variety on the relatively small menu.(Bacon wrapped dog\/Chicken gyro\/Green chili pork\/Korean spiced beef) Waited for 15 mins and no one said a word to me. Not one word.  I saw between 1-3 employees.   Now this place is fairly big, and I was the only on the Eastern side.   There was a bartender the entire time I was there.  About 15 feet from me.  You may be wondering if the place was packed and the bartender was slammed.  Not so much.  There were two other guys there who finished their meal after I was there about 10 mins.  When I walked out, it was just me, the bartender, air and opportunity.  Now I'm sure some of you would have made your presence known and tried to get some service.  Eh, I wasn't in the mood for that, so I just left.  I was confident in the fact that there were other places selling food on downtown Mill.  I may try it again another day.  In the meantime, here's a lil' something to remember me by.
