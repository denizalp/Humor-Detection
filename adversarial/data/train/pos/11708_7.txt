Who knew that there were so many different kinds of ice to be had in this town?  Shave ice, snow ice, and now, Fluffy snow.  I was intrigued by the coupon I got in a mailer that touted the stuff at Easy Life, so I ventured over there last night after dinner at Settebello.\nThere are three flavors available:  Thai tea, mango, and strawberry.  I ordered the small size with red beans, bananas, and condensed milk and it was plenty; I'm not sure I could handle a bigger size.  The best way to describe the ice is that it's a cross between gelato and sherbet.  I think I was expecting something more like the snow ice at Icy Juicy, which I absolutely love and to which I am addicted.  This was definitely heavier in consistency and tasted good, but I think I still like snow ice better, maybe because you can start with just plain snow ice and then add the flavors you want to it.  I wouldn't normally order strawberry, Thai tea, or mango gelato or sherbet, so there you go!
