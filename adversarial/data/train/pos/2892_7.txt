So, I decided to try this place... twice. My 1st mistake was trying this place. My second... trying it again.\nI work 1 mile from here and was always curious. I have never been inside, always had a co-worker go get it. Outside looks run down, not the type of Thai food restaurant you would in that part of Phoenix. \nI cannot recall what I had my 1st time there, only remembering running to McDonald's  after trying it.\nThe second time I ordered beef Pad Thai. This is your typical Thai dish, usually one of the most favored of all their dishes. \nI had the misfortune of taking several bites before throwing it away. The beef was extremely dry, the noodles soaked in oil, and overcooked. My egg roll was nothing special. The Thai tea tasted like powder. I even tried a colleagues soup, which was pretty bad (I saw oil floating at the top). \nStay away from this place.
