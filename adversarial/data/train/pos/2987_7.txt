This company will be reported to all agencies that oversee racial discrimination. Dan Bradley's Glass Shop (DBGS) response I received today from the Better Business Bureau strongly supports my previous statement that are racists liars. \nDBGS stated in the BBB response the following: \"SHE STARTED MAKING COMMENTS TO FELICIA ABOUT BEING A \"SISTA\" AND IF IT WAS TOO DIFFICULT FELICIA COULD GET ONE OF HER \"HOME BOYS\" TO DO IF FOR HER\n SHE CALLED SEVERAL TIMES AND SPOKE TO FELICIA ASKING HER TO SEND HER BOYFRIEND ETC AND SHE WOULD GIVE HIM $ 50.00   SHE WAS MAKING FELICIA UNCOMFORTABLE ASKING HER TO DO SOMETHING CLEARLY AGAINST OUR COMPANY POLICY\"\nAs a recipient of TWO college degrees and the fact that I attended a TOP LAW SCHOOL in the USA, (USC), I do not speak the way Joy Bradley stated in her RACIST response, and that style of language was NEVER reflected in my prior Yelp reviews or BBB Complaint. Either Felicia blatantly lied on me or Joy\/DBGS fabricated such talk in their BBB response because they consider such language \"Black\" to support their agenda. \nI do not call black women \"sistas\", and have never used the term \"home boys\" in my life. Further, I would not have known Felicia had a boyfriend that also worked at DBGS if Felicia had not told me. Felicia also told me she \"shacks\" with her boyfriend not too far from where I live. Clearly, Felicia felt very comfortable with me to share such personal information. Joy's statement that I wanted Felicia to send her boyfriend over if preposterous prima facie, as no woman would make such a statement, and only proves that Joy & DBGS makes whatever desperate, sloppy & cheap statements to support their position. Further, I never quoted any amount ($50), as I cannot tell DBGS what to charge their customers.\nIf Felicia lied on me she will lie on anyone, as I'd only been to DBGS once, will NEVER return, & I was only attempting to complete a business transaction & patronize DBGS. Perhaps Felicia lied to her co-workers because felt she needed support & to keep her job. Additionally, at the time I was at DBGS Felicia was the only Black.\nDon't go just by my review her, look at all the other MANY HORRIBLE REVIEWS OF DBGS & RUN FROM THESE IGNORANT\/RACISTS LIARS!
