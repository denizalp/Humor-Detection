I just got done standing in front of the Mac books for 30 minutes without a single associate asking if I needed help. Finally a manager type walks by and asks if I need help. Yes, I would like to purchase a Mac book, the most expensive laptop in the store. He'll get someone. He speaks with two gentlemen who do not come over to assist, but walk the other way. \n\nYes, assist the attractive 22 year old girl that just walked in and wants to buy a $79 iPod touch. I was just about to drop $1200 on a new MacBook. I'm done. The $75 lower price is not worth this. I'll go to the Apple Store tomorrow. At least someone will acknowledge that I exist there.
