After seeing Valley Youth Theatre's production of Shrek The Musical (which was awesome by the way) yesterday, I realized that while I've been to the Herberger Theater countless times, I have yet to review it!\n\nThe HTC gets a large variety of shows.  I've seen tons of Arizona Theatre Company productions, some smaller group performances, and even a hip-hop \/ spoken word event.  Arts and musicals dominate their calendar of events, but they sometimes host the opera or ballet as well.  There is plenty of parking nearby (although you will likely have to pay for it).  There is typically a concessions area offered but you cannot take food into the theater itself.  And there are plenty of restrooms.\n\nThis is my favorite theater in the Valley to see a show at; it reminds me of some of the theaters that I grew up going to as a little girl in Detroit.  Some may not know that the HTC is actually a non-profit organization and their mission is to support and foster the growth of performing arts in Phoenix.  I'd say they are succeeding in that already and I plan to continue to support them.\n\nTLDR: This place is a fabulous venue located in the heart of downtown Phoenix.  It's kept up well, the staff are always friendly, and there's really not a bad seat in the house.
