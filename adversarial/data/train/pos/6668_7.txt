Yelp introduced me to Zuppa's Deli.  Loved this place and am so glad we gave it a try last week.\n\nI ordered The Little Italy Specialty Sandwich composed of \"Prosciutto di Parma, Fresh Mozzarella, Cracked Black Pepper, Extra Virgin Olive Oil, arugula and a fig spread on toasted Italian Bread.\"  Good but not phenomenal.  I wish the The Little Italy were a panini rather than a sandwich, though I'm biased because I love panini!  The combination of the sweet fig spread and the bitter arugula really made the flavors pop, but for me the sandwich wasn't quite moist enough.\n\nMy boyfriend's Zuppaleta Panini (\"Pastrami and Honey Ham with olive Tapenade, sweet basil dressing and shaved parmesan\") was fantastic.  Loaded with meat and liquidity and flavor.\n\nZuppa's, from my experience, is an impeccably clean casual little plaza deli with table and booth seating options.  You pay at the counter, and then your order's brought out when it's ready.  We received very friendly and efficient service from The Big Guy--you'll know him when you see him.  Really nice gentleman.\n\nI'd return to Zuppa's Deli in a heartbeat, and you should check it out too if you haven't already.
