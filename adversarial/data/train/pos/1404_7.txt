I've been coming off and on to this location since it opened years ago.  The formula still works.  Put in a large cool bar and stock it with more alcohol than needed to inebriate a small country.  Add to the wow factor by having attractive and tightly cladded servers and hostesses.\n\nJoey's Don Mills does it one better by putting a rooftop patio with retractable roof and another cool bar.  A collection of bar stools, high tables, booths, and low seating makes hanging out in the sun enjoyable for everyone.\n\nService has always been spot on.  Happy hour drinks are nice - $4 beers and $2 off on glasses of wine.  Food on the other hand is passable.  I usually stick to appys and not eat a meal but sometimes you have to and when you do, stick to the classics.  Some of the fusion stuff and sushi things are not that great.\n\nParking is horrible.  Don't circle around.  Park in the tower and take a short walk.  You're gonna want to take a walk back to the car to guage your drive-worthiness after a night at Joey's.  If you can't walk back to the tower, you know it's Uber-time!\n\nCheers.
