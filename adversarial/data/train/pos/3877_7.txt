Best waste of a Saturday night, the fact that the place was empty should have really sent the red flags flying! Meal made it to the table before the appetizer, soup and salad and yet the nonchalant attitude regarding the issue really baffled me (this is not a new place of business) anyway, don't waste your time and money here!\nIt is too bad that there are no zero stars options.
