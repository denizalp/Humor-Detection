The top hairdresser in there is Henry Ta,i have met him last year and i will not let anyone else touch my hair but Henry. He is very good with colors like blonde,silver or ombr√© hairstyle. You name it,he can do it all. \nThe place is pretty nice,he also has the speaker with cool music in his suite. He is a perfectionist,always wants to make sure that you love his work and easy to talk to.\nI told all of my female friends go to him and they all love the way he does hair.\nCheck him out on instagram : stylisthenhen . You wont regret it.
