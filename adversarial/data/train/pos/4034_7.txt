So, it's been almost a year since my FTR on Salon Ami... and Ashley Scott is still doing wonders with my hair!  \n\nI saw Ashley again today for highlights and I can't tell you how many compliments I've gotten both on the cut and color.  \n\nI know at least a handful of friends and fellow yelpers that have gone to see Ashley and they are all extremely thankful to have found her.  Like Kelly S says, Ashley is gifted... If you are looking for a fantastic stylist, go see Ashley at Salon Ami!
