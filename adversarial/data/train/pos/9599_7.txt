Wow, definitely a different experience compared to your regular dinner spot. Amazing food, amazing ambiance and friendly servers. \n\nCame here on a Saturday night and it wasn't as busy as usual (my friend has been here a few times and she says it is usually always packed), but maybe because of the ice storm that happened over the weekend. We made reservations before coming here just incase. Upon arrival, we had to wait a few minutes for the servers to clean up some tables even though not all tables were full.\n\nThe restaurant is pretty clean from the looks of it and the staff were very friendly. They gave us recommendations and checked up on us here and there. Only thing would be that it was extremely hard to get a hold of a server when we needed them.\n\nThe food was AMAZING! I've tried a few items on the menu but my favourites would include the following:\n- Mushroom tenderloin steak\n- Beyti kebap\n- Puree eggplant with minced beef\n\nP.S. there's live music here (Middle Eastern) and it was really good! However, this is not a place to come catch up with someone, because it is SO hard to hear others talk!
