I followed Melanie from her last location, and was excited to try the new location.\nI was 5 mins early for my appointment but wasn't helped by the front desk for 15 mins.\nFinally after getting checked in, I sat an additional 25 mins and had to go to the front desk to remind them I was there.\nWithin 5 mins Melanie came and got me, no other patients were there... Should have been a red flag.\n\nShe was a little short with me in the beginning but softened when we were done when I left a tip.\n\nI had to go back 2 weeks later for a slight touch up on 2 areas, awkward to say the least.\n\nShe used dysport on me, which usually lasts 6-9 months...\nIt must have been watered down because now only 2 1\/2 months later, I need a full redo.\n\nI will NOT go back, with so many places, I'm surprised she didn't seem to try that hard.
