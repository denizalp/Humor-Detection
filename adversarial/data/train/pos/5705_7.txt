This hotel was much better than what I expected it to be. Especially since it was one of the cheapest hotels I found and it's still technically on the strip. The bed was comfortable and the room was also clean. I loved the wood furniture in the room and flooring. We called ahead letting the hotel know we were going to be late and they assured us that it was fine and there would be someone at the front desk to check us in. \n\nThere were some interesting people hanging outside their rooms at 1am, but nothing to be too concerned about. I was disappointed that the room didn't include a refrigerator and a microwave since we had leftover food and wanted to make oatmeal in the mornings. \n\nThe location of this hotel is great and near the stratosphere. You get a good view of the stratosphere at night.
