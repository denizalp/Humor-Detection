Three stars because the experience was OK but I wouldn't go so far as to say I'm a fan. \n\nTHE FOOD\n\nI started with the \"Waldorf salad\" ($10), MTK's modern interpretation of the classic. While I appreciated the attempt to lighten it up by omitting the traditional mayonnaise dressing, their citrus vinaigrette combined with the tartness of the sour apple gave me a bad case of pucker mouth. \n\nI also don't like it when too many hands have touched my food; it's just a salad, not a jigsaw puzzle. I could tell from the overwrought arrangement of the cucumber peeled into ribbons, squares of iceberg lettuce torn just so, and uniform grape slices--yes, they even sliced the grapes--that someone had been pawing the produce like it was prom night.\n\nNext up was the pan-seared Ontario speckled trout with roasted mushrooms, Swiss chard, celery root & walnut brown butter sauce ($26). On its own, I liked each ingredient but something about the combination of these flavors all together on one plate did not work for me, and instead of a crisp sear, I got flabby skin on the fish.\n\nThis sounds like it should be a two-star review and based simply on what I ordered, it would've been but I have to add another star based on what the S.O. ordered: shrimp cocktail and saffron-fried chicken. Both were delicious and I tried to poach off his plate as much as I could before I turned back to my own food in disappointment.\n\nAnother reason for the third star was dessert. Their take on the Baked Alaska was a confectionary dream; served as a slice, it featured lemon ice cream on a layer of sponge cake, and barely browned, fluffy peaks of meringue piped onto the top. It was a lovely, refreshing end to the meal.\n\n(Note that their menu changes frequently and the above items may not be available at all times.)\n\nSERVICE\nOverall friendly and professional, although with one head waiter and two back-up waiters, you'd think someone would've noticed that they served us our starters before bringing us our $60-bottle of wine.\n\nVIBE\n\nThe decor is ultra-modern and while this may appeal to some, it's not really to my taste. The recordings in the style of an in-flight announcement in their restrooms struck me as gimmicky. Like ha ha, I get it; the restaurant looks like a super-hip airport lounge but can I just pee in peace, please?\n\nBOTTOM LINE: Some choose to pray at Mildred's Temple Kitchen, and, hey, that's cool, but I personally don't subscribe to her religion.
