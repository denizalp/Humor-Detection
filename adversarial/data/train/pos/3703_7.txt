This is a pretty fantastic spa and salon. The only reason it is not getting 5 stars is because the prices are insane! But I guess one can expect that when staying at such a resort.\n\nI arrived for my hair appointment on Friday evening. I was scheduled for 6pm and arrived very late due to a delayed flight. The salon closes at 7pm but they still took me in, knowing that they would have to stay well pass 7 to finish my hair. \n\nThey had 3 people working on me to get my thick locks looking their best. They also gave me tea and apples :) \n\nI would definitely come back here when in Vegas.
