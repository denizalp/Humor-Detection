If food were a spectator sport. Then you outta know I'm a fan of MEAT. I love beef. I even love driving by farms and cattle and watching them and anticipating end products of skirt steaks and cuts of prime rib and  bone in ribeye. Yes that's what I got. Becuase I love meat. Of all the places in the mall to eat. You would never expect  a great quality piece of cow in the Forum shops. It exists in the Palm Chophouse. Belive me the size made me quiver in my panties if I owned any. Just like any other steakhouse, everything is pretty a la carte. Some people won't admit to gluttony because it's a sin. Well. I live in Vegas. Sin City...and what happens here stays here. So screw it. I'm a sinner.\nMeat is good. Veggies with your meat will make you feel better about yourself. But overall yes expensive and you will pay for quality and nostalgia. It's a really cool experience given the wait staff is...well you'll see :)
