Wow, consistently good service here.  My Ipod several years ago had crazy battery problems, and this store solved it by giving me a new one while other stores just told me that I should just change the settings (I had tried everything there was.)  \n\nMy laptop also was making funny noises, and the Genius took a look at it and gave me a prompt answer and solution.  Love it!  \n\nThe store is busy, but not ridiculously so, and there is always someone on hand to help.  It was actually also possible to get an appointment at the Genius Bar for the same day, instead of having to come back the next day - wow!  \n\nAnd, unlike the Eaton Centre store, it doesn't smell like a men's hockey bag.  Come here if you ever need help.
