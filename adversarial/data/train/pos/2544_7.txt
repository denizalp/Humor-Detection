Staying across this Fresh & Easy for short term, the store opens 24\/7.  Got all of the basic food items here, normally come pick up some fruits and milk.  The store is clean and the price is good, also they got dollar hot coffee. \n\nNot too many people works in the store, they are going the self check out route however someone will always man one of the cashier.  The people that works there are real friendly, always go out of the way to help.
