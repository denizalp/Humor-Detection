When someone said \"l'habit ne fait pas le moine\" about this place, he wasn't kidding.\n\nI originally bookmarked this place per recommendation from someone sat next to me on one of the flight I took earlier this year, then shortly after that, I saw a familiar Yelper's review about this place. My chance to try here finally came when I paused from traveling.  Like I said in the beginning, I wouldn't have came here if I didn't know about this place.\n\nOnce you step inside, it was very lovely. It looks like owned by a French couple, husband is a chef and wife is a server. Cute decor, makes you think you are in the countryside of France.\n\nFrench onion soup (Soupe Ã  l'oignon) was the best I've ever had. I normally get tired of eating onion soup after while as it gets too salty, but this one had a nice flavor (mild enough to eat the whole bowl), I enjoyed to the last bit. Bowl is very large, soup could be just enough meal alone.\n\nAs recommended by my seatmate from that flight, I tried their crepe.  Crepe Madame was served with French fried (frite). Cheese, egg, crepe was cooked just so perfectly, it was easy to eat the whole thing very quick. \n\nVery lovely place to enjoy your branch or lunch. Great way to start leisurely weekend.
