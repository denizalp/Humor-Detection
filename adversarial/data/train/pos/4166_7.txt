Pretty easy choice here. If you are visiting Las Vegas and your friends are suggesting the Lotus Of Siam as the 'best Asian place', laugh hysterically in their face(s), jump in a cab, and go 5 blocks West of the Strip to Yonaka. For the price of a family dinner at Applebee's, you will have a fresh, down-to-earth Asian food experience that will inspire you to come back every night for the rest of your vacation.\n\nToo much to list here. Best and freshest or else they don't serve it. The right aftertastes, the right texture and flavor contrasts, creative cheffing that is never snooty. Just great ingredients and always the best service. Have eaten there 8 times in 2 months. Will turn a non-sushi eater into a sushi-eater. Will turn a sushi-eater into a sushi-expert. (they also do ridiculous things with pork and beef - like their tea ribs, their Nikuberry steak w\/strawberries, and their new Momofuku-killing Chuka Buns.)\n\nWill be the requisite first dinner for all out-of-town guests this coming season.\nAwesome Happy Hour, too!
