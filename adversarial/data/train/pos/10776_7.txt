Went there last weekend with my GF and a friend of mine. We choose this club as because it has both male and female stripper on the same club and it is a full nudity and alcohol serve venue. The female stripper side was fabulous, excellent or whatever u like to call it, but however the male stripper side was a total disaster. My girl ask for a lap dance as the price menu said $35 for 3 songs. The stripper ask for $50 for 3 songs, and what the hell, as long as she is having fun, I don't mind. After the lap dance, the male stripper ask for $100 and it's not even one song. And he said, he had do extra minute as a favor for us. Yeah, we do look like out-of-town couples, but that doesn't mean we can taken for granted. And even the money is spend at not at it set price, she is not even having any fun at all. \n\nSorry Palomino, I am giving u one star because of this. But the female stripper club, it's a go-go. We love it.
