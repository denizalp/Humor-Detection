What comes to mind with the meal we had here is \"meh\".  It wasn't bad but it certainly wasn't great.  The location is way off strip and the decor is cute.  My wife is Austrian and she felt the schnitzel wasn't fried as it should have been.  It was not crispy as you might expect.  Her mom ordered the kinder frankfurter and she enjoyed it.  \n\nThe owner of the restaurant isn't very friendly but he appears to be the cook so he is probably busy.  We asked where the frankfurters were from and he wouldn't tell us.  Um..OK whatever buddy.  Vegas is lacking when it comes to German restaurants so this is a viable option.  We have tried Cafe Berlin and enjoyed it very much.  Hofbrau is great for ambiance but the prices are very high.  \n\nThis place is just ok. I wouldn't drive across town to come here.
