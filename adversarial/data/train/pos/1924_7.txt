La la love this spot for live music and networking events. Came here to watch the Black Bottom Lighters. Service is amazing even during a crazy concert and drinks were reasonable. Tons of space to get your groove on, I highly recommend getting a table so you get the best view on the second floor overlooking the crowd. Love the decor and definitely would be back for another event!
