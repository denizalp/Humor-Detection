Was getting my car washed next door and wanted to grab a bite to eat.  Since I love BBQ, this was an easy decision for me to give this place a shot.  After browsing the menu, I decided to try:\n4 oz BBQ Beef Brisket Sandwich, $4.50\nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/z8Em-bhZI3Mmspml7tj6tg?select=Erry3muhVFQdFZQPCJRHzw\n2 oz Hot Link Sandwich, $3\nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/z8Em-bhZI3Mmspml7tj6tg?select=qxTdcqqimxhFcmoW1Iyj9g\nI got them both \"dressed\", which means they give you Onions & Pickles on the side to put on the Sandwich.\n\nNext to the Soda Fountain, there are vats of Hot & Mild BBQ Sauce for self service.  I of course went for the Hot BBQ Sauce.\n\nThe food is delivered to your table when it's ready.  I went for the Hot Link Sandwich first and didn't put any Hot BBQ Sauce on it so that I could taste the natural Spiciness of the Hot Link.....well, I was disappointed, it's not very hot at all.  Damn, the search for real BBQ Hot Link Sandwiches continues.\n\nNext, I went for the BBQ Beef Brisket Sammie.....I poured some Hot BBQ Sauce and added the Onions & Pickles to it.  It's not a bad Sandwich.....pretty good.  I thought the Bread was a bit blah....like grocery store Bread......a nice Italian or French Roll would have been better with it.  The Beef was tender and juicy and had a slightly smoky flavor to it.  I prefer it to have a bit more flavor to it, but like how they serve you the Sandwich dry and allow you to put your own BBQ Sauce on it.\n\nThe Hot BBQ Sauce was pretty spicy......really enjoyed that a lot.\n\nOverall, it was a pretty good experience.\n\nReturn Factor - 71%
