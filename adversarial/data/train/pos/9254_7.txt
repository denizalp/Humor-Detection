Best place EVER! After an amazing tribe win of 22 straight I wanted to check out Wilberts which Is right next to Thirsty Parrot! Live band, full bar, and a great food menu was clutch. I ordered the grouper sandwich with fries (only $1 extra instead of chips) and my friend got the quesadilla. Both were so delicious! The grouper was so flavorful and cooked just right. \n\nHands down my new fave tribe spot before & after games. Did I mention $5 stoli vodkas?! 5 STARS!
