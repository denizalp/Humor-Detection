This company is not professional. They gave me a 3 hour time window and showed up 3 1\/2 hours after that. I waited 7 hours to have them come out with no courtesy call to tell me they were that late, I had to call twice to get a time. When the got here he opened up my unit messed with some wires then left and said they had to send somebody different. I called to schedule and the guy on the phone was rude and said they'd come when they could. I explained I had waited all day for them to do nothing today and I had an appt the next day. I told them I wouldn't be home till 1. He stated he would send somebody after 1. The next day they came at 12. I obviously wasn't home and the person watching my son politely answered and said I wasn't home. The technician didn't even look up from his clipboard and walked away. I called the same day at 3:30 when they still weren't back again and they gave me an attitude saying they had already come and I'd have to reschedule again. I was so frustrated at them since they came early and didn't bother to call and tell me they weren't coming back as now I've been waiting around for 2 separate days.  The lady on the phone said the technician said they couldn't come back and I explained that he did not and the lady said \"you weren't there and neither was I\". How dare they call me a liar! This company is rude and unprofessional. I will not do business them and I hope people read this and do the same. K and B came out and repairs my garage same day, came on time, and called when they were on their way. I recommend them!
