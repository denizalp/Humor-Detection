Absolutely the worst show I  have ever seen in Vegas. Terrific band backing up a mediocre talent who thinks that posing and wearing a hat makes him Sinatra. Sound level varies from excruciating to totally unbearable. Addition of stripper type dancers might be pleasant, but the whole show is performed In the dark. I can understand why. If I were him I wouldn't want to be recognized either. The one recognizable song I heard, \"Luck Be A Lady\" was sung in a wispy out of tune delivery, backed up by an extraordinarily loud arrangement .  In between songs he mutters interminably and incomprehensibly in a London accent while frequently placing his hand over his heart to indicate that he is sincere. This a punctuated by the nonstop playing of the rhythm section so that any chance of understanding what he is saying is obliterated. I was led to believe that this would be a Sinatra\/ Bennett\/Martin type show and all the recorded music prior to the arrival of the actual musicians (they were 25 minutes late) was of that variety. Nothing like it occurred on stage. I would rather be tied to a pole and forced to listen to Justin Bieber sing Dylan followed by 12 hours of Ciirque de Soleil than have to listen to this guy for half an hour.  Only show I have EVER walked out on in my entire life.
