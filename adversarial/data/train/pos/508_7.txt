There was something just a bit off for an upscale steakhouse. Got the feel they may cater to regulars, and outsiders get sized up before the assign wait staff.  Food was well seasoned, service was okay-server was nice, but I definitely didn't feel pampered. I don't think bread is offered unless you ask for it, which we finally did well after appetizer was eaten- really? When you are paying over $60 per meal I'd think a little bread would be in order. Out of the dessert we wanted.  I probably wouldn't be prompted to return anytime soon.
