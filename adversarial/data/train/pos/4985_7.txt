Yaaasss! The night staff here is AMAZING! Pizza was delicious, but the staff blew it out of the park! We just left, and the Sunday night staff was just so extremely happy, it blew our minds. They're so genuine, helpful, and customer oriented it was awesome! \n\nOrdering here is simple, there's a few different dough choices; we opted for the double dough (9.29$) otherwise they have the thin crust (5.99$) I'm not a fan of red sauce, so I did the olive oil, my boyfriend did the organic spicy tomato which was AMAZING!!! When we go back, that's my next choice. Loaded mine with buffalo milk mozzarella, chicken, shrooms, bacon, jalapenos, and spinach. Took a few minutes to cook, and BAM eating time. My nd basically got a meat lovers with cilantro. \n\nMy pizza was phenomenal! Cooked perfect, with crispy crust and so gooey with all that cheese! My bf ate his entire pizza while I was on my 2nd slice, THAT GOOD. \n\nI love the hot sauce choices here, their cayenne hot sauce has a kick to it, the mango garlic was ok, and the Booney mango was good. \n\nTheir soda machine is pretty amazing and all high-tech!\n\nThe food was delicious, but the real reason to go here is the customer service from the crew! They were just so happy! I love them, they're seriously amazing!
