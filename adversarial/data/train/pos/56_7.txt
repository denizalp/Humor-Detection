In general, I love BBQ.  I grew up with a mom who raked snow and ice off the grill to BBQ in the winter!  \n\nI tried a few BBQ places when I first moved here, but I gave up on BBQ in Phoenix shortly after moving here and I didn't eat BBQ unless I cooked it.  Unfortunately for  all BBQ places in Phoenix (past, present and future), as far as I am concerned, there is LMBBQ(I try not to use another business' name in my reviews) and then there are all other BBQ places in Phoenix.  \n\nI stopped here on a whim to give this place a second try, 2 years after the first time.  I was underwhelmed by the food that I tried.  I ordered the Po'Boy sandwich... a mountain of meat... sausage, brisket (chef's choice), and pulled pork.  The meat was far too saucy for me.  I do not care for sauce on my BBQ.  I prefer the sauce as a garnish,  on the side. I think it was added to the sandwich and I wish I had been asked. The sauce wasn't very tasty itself.  The brisket was tender and juicy, but it lacked a deep smokey flavor that I enjoy!  Same for the brisket.  The sausage on my sandwich didn't taste fresh,  so I didn't eat it more than a bite or two.   Rather unfortunate because I bet normally the regular sausage is good. \n\nThe only bright spot was the jalapeno sausage I ordered on the side that, it JUST occurred to me, didn't taste like it was spiced with jalapeno, but black pepper.  Nevertheless,  the sausage was not greasy and it tasted pretty good.   \n\ni really would like to see BBQ places in and around Phoenix win, but this place is didn't satisfy my taste-buds.  For Phoenix, I suppose it meets some folks needs.  For me, its a \"do not return\", unless LMBBQ burns down.\n\nReturn Factor - 1%.
