Monday morning before leaving Vegas breakfast led to Omelet House. Okay, but pretty average in my book, at least our selections. You could tell how popular this place is by the almost full parking lot. The server that showed us to the Garden Room, mentioned how crowded they were, probably due to it being the day after Father's Day. The Garden Room was a bit more intimate, fake hanging plants and all.\n\nOur server gave us a few minutes to look over our menus, then we decided on the following: my wife the Health Nut Omelet, since in her words \"you can't come to Omelet House without ordering an Omelet. That would be like going to IHOP without ordering pancakes\". Her extra tomatoes were noticeably missing and when brought to the server's attention he removed the additional .79 charge. She also chose the banana nut bread which came out first. She shared it with me but I only wanted a small sample, which was very good and moist. \n\nOur plates arrived not too long after. Oh, I ordered the Huevos Rancheros with scrambled eggs. Good sauce and large portions, but I've definitely had better. I also ordered a side of 2 Turkey Sausage Patties(average). Not to say that I didn't clean my plate, my wife even joked that all I needed to do now was lick it. I was hungry. She had plenty to bring back home. One plus was the size of my regular order of orange juice. No need to go large when regular is enough to wash it all down.
