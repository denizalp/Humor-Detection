I wish I had a smart phone to upload pictures...one day...nonetheless, I enjoyed my visit to R Lounge.  As I understand it, this establishment was previously known as Zoan; I don't know what this entails, but I can give you the details for what I saw.\n\nA friend invited us for a drag\/cabaret show.  Told us we should arrive half an hour early to get a seat.  Try 45 minutes?  Maybe and hour?  It was packed!  And with good reason.  The subsequent performances were kinky, sexy and raucous fun.  To top it off, they gave away free toys (e.g. nipple clamps, inflatable butt plug, restraints and more!).  If you're jealous, don't fret, this will be happening EVERY third Friday.  Yay!!\n\nBeyond the great show, the bar staff were friendly and patient, regardless of how annoying we may have been.  When a friend was target of unwanted flirtation and an unwanted drink, the server supported her in her efforts to get rid of the excess alcohol (she was driving!).\n\nAs a queer person, I felt comfortable in this space.  It was mostly occupied by female bodied folks, but all were welcome; it was a gender bending, queer fest :)  And, as a show night, a real leather caucus.
