I found a Facebook coupon for $19 for 5 hours.   Jennifer came and did a great job.  They recommended that I have 3.5 hours but I declined and said whatever she could get done in 2.5 I was fine with.  She did a wonderful job and I would have her come back again any time.  After she did left I found a few places (like behind the bathroom door in the corner) that I think were just missed but overall good job.
