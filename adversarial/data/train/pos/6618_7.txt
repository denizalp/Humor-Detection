Cute little cafe with a collection of items that they showcase throughout the store. In one corner you'll feel like you are on a plane with the three fake windows hanging on the walls with what appear to be clouds through them. Feel free to pick up a journal hanging on the wall, reflect, and share your thoughts in that corner. Then you have the corner that motivates you to study with different typewriters lined up in a row (I called dibs on this corner of course!). They offer multiple outlets throughout the store--great for hanging around for a couple hours to study. Then you have the chill, I'm going to lie down and study corner with the open, emptied out Volkswagen and pillows on the floor. This corner will for sure put me to sleep, so I shied away from this corner. \n\nAll in all, cute and comfortable cafe to study in or hang out at. I ordered the Nutella honey toast which  I scarfed down in a heartbeat. The watermelon ade was not a favorite of mine. The carbonation of the drink didn't match the watermelon flavor. I'll stick to watermelon slushies and plain ol' lemonade next time. Definitely coming back again!
