I would like to propose a brief test to determine the likelihood of whether or not you will enjoy your experience at Little Casesar's.  Please answer \"Yes\" or \"No\" to the following questions:\n\n1. Are you drunk?\n\nIf you answered \"Yes\" - congratulations!  You'll enjoy your experience here finding a cheap and quick way to get some food in your stomach and to sober up enough to stumble home.  Bonus points if you are in walking distance to the location from Lakewood's divey east-end bars so as not to endanger anyone trying to drive here to pick up a hot-and-ready.\n\nIf you answered \"No\" and somehow still want to try this out.  Please smash a tomato onto a piece of toast that has been dunked in butter and sprinkle cheese and toppings where desired.  You'll thank me later for saving you the money and the hassle.
