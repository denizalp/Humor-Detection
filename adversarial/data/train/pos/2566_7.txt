Two stars because it was Sinatra night and the singer was fantastic. As far as everything else goes, service was deplorable, took an hour to order and then 45 minutes later when I asked a manager about it I was told it would be another ten minutes. He offered to comp the food if we didn't like it. Not once was a curseword uttered or was my voice raised the entire time we spoke. Upon leaving we were told by this manager that he had \"taken enough abuse\" and he also told my family to never come back. They failed to execute on every front from start to finish, except the singer. I am amazed they are still in business.
