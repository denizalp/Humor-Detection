Recently went in for drinks with a small group on a quiet night. We were greeted by a friendly hostess. This was definitely the best part of the night. The restaurant had about a dozen patrons and a dozen employees to match but you could do nothing short of setting a large fire to get their attention. After waiting 25 minutes, our beers finally arrived (one at a time, for some reason). I have never waited so long for a pint of beer in my life. I contemplated drinking my own urine, but I heard it doesn't get you buzzed. This is when one of the staff members came over with her own beer and gave a cheers to the table. She seemed to get her beer a lot faster than we did. If I felt like waiting 25 minutes for a beer, I wouldn't. Since we didn't feel like waiting for a second round, we paid our bill and packed up. On our way out, the once friendly hostess was now talking on her cellphone, arguing with her boyfriend. Lose the zero, girl! You're a babe but your restaurant sucks.
