I love Different Pointe of View!  I came here for Restaurant week, made reservations, and watched the sun set. My fianc√© thought it was the best view from a restaurant he has seen so far! \n\nService was spectacular - first course, Buttermilk Fried Soft Shell Crab\nHoney Sweet Corn Polenta, Asparagus Puree, Piquillo Pepper Emulsion. It was a whole small crab and I ate that thing like it was no one's business!\n\nSecond course - Seared Blue Nose Sea Bass Crispy Saffron Parmesan Risotto Cake, Rapini, Peppadew Pepper Reduction. My oh my! It was so deliciously scrumptious!\n\nThird course - Peanut butter cheesecake was so damn yummy! It was a good ending to a great meal! We went outside right after the dinner on to the patio and the view is breathtaking! \n\nEven with restaurant week prices, you do spend more than $50\/pp with tax, wine, and tip...but it was worth it!
