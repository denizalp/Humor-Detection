If ever you're in Vegas, you HAVE to drive off the strip and try this place. Everyone's already said it: Red Velvet Panckes ftw! It's a pretty small place but the quality of the food was amazing. Along with the Red Velvet pancakes we ordered the Carrot Cake pancakes and Almond Joy Pancakes with a side of hash browns. The carrot cake pancake is exactly what it sounds, it was just like eating a slice of carrot cake. Pretty delish.. the Almond Joy pancake was a little overwhelming. I think that flavor should stay with the chocolate bar alone. We had a 45 min wait, the service was good and fast. They have such a diverse selection for pancakes its amazing but if you're feeling overwhelmed just try the red velvet, you can't go wrong! They serve the pancakes half stack and full stack. Half stack is 3 pancakes and full is 6. Not sure who can eat a full stack but kudos to you. This is definitely one of those places you kinda have to try once.
