This is the future of Kbbq! Get out of here with all the All You Can Eat junk. This is how quality Kbbq is supposed to taste! Don't get me started on how the service should be as well. This packed house is said to be busy nightly! We waiting for about an hour because of how busy it was. Once we were seated the games got started. We were being serviced very well. The servers bring out the meat, cook, and serve it to you. We went with the beef combination. All the meats we had were just delicious. The skirt steak, short ribs, briskets... everything. The ban chan was good, rice was hot and soft, steamed egg and tofu soup to die for. And the ice cream dessert that comes at the end. Hobak is the best Korean BBQ spot in Vegas! Yeah I said it! I'll come back next time to try the Pork Combo\n\nRecommendation: Beef combo
