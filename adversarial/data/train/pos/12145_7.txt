FRICK..these I got HONEYBALLS on my mind.\n\nMy Greek friend has got me addicted to these delicious honey-soaked waaaaay-better-than-tim-bit-shaped dough.\n\nGet it with cinnamon.\nThese things are cheap and you're gonna want to eat the whole box yourself.  \nSo to make sure you don't... open the box in a room full of people.  walk away.\nDO it! walk AWAY from the box...and come back 15 minutes later.\nIf you are lucky there will be one left.\n\nTiny little place is open late and is usually filled up with Greek post-dinner families.\nSo get these bad boys to go.\n\nThese are like..the greek equivalent to the Korean red-bean balls in K-town.\n\nEvery culture makes a good ball.\nIt really IS the superior form for dessert.
