This is one of the most horrible and expensive place I've been to. I went there once and I immediately know that I will not be there again.\n\nThis place is expensive. A price for one pizza in this place, I can almost get three in Pizza Hut or other pizza restaurant and it's even better. It's funny how it says Meatballs Pizza, I thought there are going to be meatballs in the pizza and that is why it cost about 20 bucks. I was wrong. The pizza was not even that big for the price it cost us and the meatballs were cut into the slice like pepperoni.\n\nThe waiting also even worse. I waited for about almost 20 minutes until the the pizza is ready.\n\nI will not recommend this place.
