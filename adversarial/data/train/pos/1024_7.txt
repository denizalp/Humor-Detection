I really hate to do this downgrade, but I have to for the sake of all those that love good beer and some sort of decent service.\n\nAfter my fourth visit, I'll likely refrain from stopping in to  WOB for quite some time. 15 minutes at a table, and 10 at the bar, and still no one would talk to us to take our orders and money. Even after trying to flag folks down at the bar and table, my friends and I were totally ignored. Sure, they have a phenomenal selection of beer, but that doesn't do me a bit of good if no one will take my order. The employees were too busy yucking it up with each other to pay us any mind at all.\n\nHopefully they'll educate their employees here pretty soon. I would love to spend money here, but they have to want to take it, first.
