i always thought earl of sandwich was hype... until i actually tried it. \n\nBEST SANDWICH I've had in awhile. wow. if you don't know what to get... order The Full Montagu ($7.45)... it is a classic sandwich but hits every note of flavor with a perfect insides to bread ratio with the bread perfectly crisp.\n\ni can't even imagine how the other sandwiches taste. i had a few bites of my other friends and again, delicious.\n\ni feel like with this place you just can't go wrong. literally changed my view of sandwiches and made me think wow how did i not try this place sooner.\n\nnot only does this place have sandwiches they have soups, parfaits, and more!!!\n\n\n\ni cannot express anymore of how good this place is. if you want a filling yet light lunch or just want a sandwich... go to earl of sandwich and get your mind blown!
