I don't get it...bad service, bad decor, and over priced...I'd rather go to a Ruth Chris or Morton's...the bartender put ice in a 16 year old single malt, and when I told her you don't do that, she took the class and poured it into another glass, keeping the ice! WTF?? Am I taking crazy pills? She said everyone orders ice in their scotch...yeah, maybe if they're a 17 year old boy and stole it from their dad's liquor cabinet....
