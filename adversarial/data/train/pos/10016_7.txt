I never realized just how hard it was to shop for a bathing suit.  Since I am not of t ypical size (I refuse to go into more in this review about that), I can't go to a typical store (Everything But Water, Macy's...wherever) to find a bathing suit that fits.  After going to many stores on Saturday and experiencing lyrca burn everywhere on my body...I decided to check out this store.  \n\nWhile I feel that the customer service had a little bit to be desired, they had a wonderful selection of suits that fit any woman of any size.  The bikinis had a mix of sizes...and it just wasn't the typical small - large...they went by bra sizes all the way up to size G...they cater to everybody.  That alone makes it a wonderful experience.\n\nWhile the type of bathing I was looking for was not a speciality of theirs (Speedo - and they did carry a few), I found a suit that fit and didn't make me look like a scary slob.  Also, the prices were spot on...I didn't have to pay a fortune to look good.\n\nI give it 3.5 stars....selection was great...but they lost some on the customer service.  (Nice ladies...but they weren't very knowledgeable and when I walked out with the bathing suit on, they didn't say anything to me.  But when I walked out with my clothes on...they asked me what I thought...a little late, I may say)
