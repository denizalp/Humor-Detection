Thank goodness for free VIP passes.\n\nTao is overrated and the lines are unusually long. Let me list a few of the reasons why:\n\n1) Bad DJ - Who mixes Jay-Z with Tammi Terrell? I don't want to hear \"Ain't no Mountain High Enough\" or \"Twist and Shout\" in a nightclub ...\n\n2) Poor 3\/4 Naked Girls in Dirty Bathwater - I felt sorry for the girls who were acting psuedo sultry in those gigantic bowls of water. I'm not sure how that was sexy ...\n\n3) Overcrowded - Unless you go into the other rooms, the main dance floor is jam packed with people. So in addition to having your personal space violated you get to smell everyone else's sweat at the same time. Mmmm delicious.\n\n4) Weak crowd - If I had a nickel for EVERY time a guy used the line \"Ni Hao Ma\" or \"Konichiwa\" to pick us up ..... gah, forget it.\n\n5) Long cab lines - The lines for the Venetian were super long, it was easier to walk down the street to catch a cab.\n\nIn short, I'd rather pay the big bucks and go to Mix Lounge or the Wynn.\nI am reminded yet again that I hate clubbing.
