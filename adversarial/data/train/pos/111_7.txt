My fork wasn't dirty when we were seated. False advertisement! Fake news!\n\nI jest, of course. Call me crazy but I'm glad they have clean forks here. ;P\n\nAny time I see eggs benny on a menu, I gotta have it! It fulfills my horror movie fantasies when I stab into a gentle poached egg and all their bodily-yolky-fluid comes cascading out like a waterfall of yellowish-orange goo! Are you readers hungry yet? Hah! \n\nSo I ordered the Eggs-quisite Benedict. The accompanying salad was really fresh and the vinaigrette was flavorful. The eggs itself were poached perfectly, the yolk popping and bleeding profusely at the softest prick of a knife, but sadly my hollandaise was broken. A broken hollandaise is a sin [see the attached picture for the curdled mess]! I was heartbroken but I was with a fun bunch so I didn't bother telling the waitstaff about it.\n\nThe staff was friendly and the place was clean. I had fun with my Yelp homies from Honolulu, Orange County, and Torrance! It was a our own little Yelper Party!
