They were pretty discriminate against my bully breed when I tried to go to the container park for the Doggie Date night. I have an American Bull dog ( Considered a bully breed) and a Doberman. They would not allow me to take in my pup because \"he looks aggressive\"  I understand their concern but at the same time, I would have appreciated them at least listening to me explain how much of a marshmallow he is. My only regret was not catching the name of the woman with black hair who sent her subordinate to tell me I was not able to enter, while talking rudely behind my back assuming I could not hear her. In my opinion it was very unprofessional. Having a pit bull as your baby comes with some backlash, I know, but this was just unacceptable.
