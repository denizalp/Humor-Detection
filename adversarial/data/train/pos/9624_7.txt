While rushing back to the office from a big time Hollywood event today I stopped int at Ricarda's to grab a sandoozle.\n\n**Full Disclosure: I stopped in to the cafe portion of Ricarda's. I did not sit down and have a full meal though I will update if I go back**\n\nThe menu is small and to tell you the truth I remember none of it other than what I got. What I got was the \"Roasted Chicken Sandwich\". However, I don't know why they called it a roasted chicken sandwich when they should have called it a chicken salad sandwich because A) That's what it is and B) Everyone loves chicken salad, it's the best salad.\n\nSo back to my sandy.\n\nThe sandwich comes on a delicious, possible freshly baked in house, crusty bun. A crusty bun which absolutely tore apart a vicious cut on the inside of my lip. I got said cut when I bit my lip on two separate occasions during a different, possibly tastier, meal earlier this week. This absolutely ruined my experience and is the only thing I can remember about the sandwich (with the exception of all I wrote above).\n\nIs it fair that I based this entire review off my inability to eat? No. \n\nBut you know what? I don't think it's particularly fair that as a grown ass man I was never taught how to chew properly. \n\nTit for Tat Ricarda's!
