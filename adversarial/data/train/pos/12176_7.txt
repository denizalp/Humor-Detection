Review of: $22.13 Pre-Fixe Lunch Menu 2013\n\nI thought the ambiance is very nice and welcoming.  Service was good.  \nFirst Course:\nGrilled Octopus and Diver Scallop Skewer.  Scallops were very tender.  Overall they were just well cooked scallops with a touch of salt.  Good, but nothing to brag about.  The Octopus however is definitely something worth bragging about.  As so many others have reviewed this octopus is wonderful.  tender and flavorful.  the char on the ends of it are the best part.  I wish i could just order a plate of it for lunch.\n\nSecond Course:\nLavraki (Bass)  & Honjake Salmon.  Both fish were extremely fresh, moist, and a light flavor. Lavraki did have alot of bones, but we were okay with that.  I feel like alot of olive oil is added after, which i think was a little bit of an over kill.\n\nDessert:\nYogurt Martini & Fresh Fruit.  These desserts aren't anything fancy, but i will say the fresh fruit was really...um...fresh. Lol!  watermelon, honey dew, cantalope, grapes, strawberries, cherries, and a pineapple.  Yogurt Martini is just plain greek yogurt with a strawberry like sauce.  i eat greek yogurt every morning, so i should have went with the Walnut cake, but read so many poor reviews i couldn't do it.\n\nI would go back for lunch again.  I noticed alot of people ordering the Lobster Pasta, but for an additional $15 i would have to think about it for lunch. Also, i want to go back and try the Milos Special (lightly fried zucchini and eggplant with tzatziki and kefalograviera cheese).  I saw alot of tables order it and the waiter also said it was a menu favorite.
