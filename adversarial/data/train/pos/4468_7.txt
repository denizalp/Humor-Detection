I was searching yelp on my visit to Las Vegas during the sema show and found this gem of a restaurant and i was so glad i did. The place was awesome looking, inside and out. The staff was super friendly and we were seated right away. The food was really good and the selection wasn't the normal stuff all other places have. If you're ever in Vegas, look this place up. I wish they had one in South Florida. Keep up the good work 702!
