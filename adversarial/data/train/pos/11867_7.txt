I am slightly concerned that I have a list for Raising Cane's and I've never reviewed this location. I've been here many times after day-drinking, and I must say....Cane's is the business.\n\nThe chicken is so moist, and juicy. It makes you want to do nasty things to it. Ok, maybe I took it a little too far. Yeah. Sorry.\n\nIt's delicious, the Texas Toast is awesome, and the sauce will make your mouth smile.\n\nGo there now.\n\nLove,\n\nMe
