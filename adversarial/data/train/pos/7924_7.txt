If you don't like Mexican food, please stop reading and unfriend me now .\n\nFiesta Burrito is nearby to my work, is open 24 hours, and has a drive through. It resembles other \"Berto\"-style establishments,  which are fast food type Mexican fare. The staff is friendly,  and the older gentleman at the front always knows it is me by my order. They are also PD friendly, which is a plus.\n\nThe restaurant inside is clean. There is a small salsa bar that is never empty. I have never used the bathroom, so I can't vouch for that. Sometimes the parking lot van get difficult. There aren't many spots,  and sometimes the line at the drive through can block other traffic through the lot. The drive through goes pretty fast, so it is never a problem for long. \n\nThe food is always hot and fresh. I have had breakfast, country, bean and cheese and Chile relleno burritos. I also have gotten macho fries, super nachos, chicken tacos, rice, beans and rolled tacos (taquitos).  They have agua fresca as well as sodas. I normally get a jamaica. I have liked everything here. The prices are fairly inexpensive.\n\nIf you are in a hurry, are headed home from the club or just want a good lunch for a good price, give Fiesta a try.
