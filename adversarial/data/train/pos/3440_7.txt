Seriously the most gross food I have ever had presented to me. Omg we had bbq pork that was obviously microwaved. Was so smelly omg I'm still feeling gross over it. Food was ok I had orange chicken. And my husband had Magolian beef. We pretty much decided to throw away our food. Anyway. Never again. The walls of this place are grossly dirty. Bathroom discussing!
