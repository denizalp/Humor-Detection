A great taco spot for anyone craving an authentic Mexican taco. Came here after a Spring Training baseball game. Tacos Calafia did not disappoint. They have $1.75 street tacos that are outstanding. Almost feels like stealing they are so good. Another taco that are \"to die for\" is the Vampiro. Very much like a tostada. A crispy tortilla that is topped with cilantro, onions, meat and guacamole. Again, an outstanding taco.\nOrdering from the friendly staff. My friends and I, on vacation from San Diego, ordered our tacos to go. Back at our hotel room. No one talked much. Just the sounds of guys eating tacos. You know the food is good when everyone is truly enjoying their meal and no one is really talking. Yes, that good.\nSupport local business especially the good ones. I am jealous I am out of towner. I would eat here every week. Tacos Calafia is a excellent taco spot. If not one of the best I have ever ate. Eat tacos here.
