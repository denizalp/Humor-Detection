I went into this shop to replace a piece of body jewelry that I had lost. When I went in I was given below average customer service. I went to the back to have it replaced and the guy kept leaving the room with his gloves on. Gloves shouldn't be worn outside of the room and who knows what he was touching. He seemed inexperienced in placing the jewelry also and it felt tight, like the post was too short. About a week and a half later I ended up going to another local shop to have the same piece removed and replaced as the short post had caused inflammation and tenderness. This was not a new piercing so it was well healed to begin with. When the jewelry from Diamond Body Shop was removed it was RUSTED!! Quality body jewelry should not rust...especially in a week and a half!! I don't know how this shop is with tattoos but I know I would not return for anything and would not recommend them just based on this experience.
