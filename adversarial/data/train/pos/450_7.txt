Been going for years.  Usually only time I go here is because someone else wants me to.  Domestic beers and shots mostly.  Food is really good from what Ive had.  Use to be a working class bar but this last Friday night it looked like an episode of Ally McBeal or How I Met Your Mother.  Young professionals \"slumming\" it have one vapid conversation after another....
