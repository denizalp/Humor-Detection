A while back I was having a bad day, and came into Greedy Girl e-x-c-i-t-e-d. This place has been at the top of my list for a long time. I'm so torn on writing this review. I'm not hard to please. Just get my order right and be nice to me and I'm yours forever (you don't even need to tell me I'm pretty).\n\nGreedy Girl is a small joint. It maybe fits about 10 people. When I visited, it was pretty full, but there was a seat or two left (size has no effect on my review, I actually like small places). When I was ordering at the register, I had a pretty awkward social exchange with the gal taking my order (she didn't seem thrilled to help me, and every time I tried to pronounce something Greek on the menu, I got judge-y vibes. Side note, I'm German, not Greek. Doing my best here). I didn't want to stress them out by adding one more person to a table, so I decided just to get my food to go.\n\nI ordered the house gyro, a pastry and a side of the Greek fries. My food came out in under 15 minutes, which was nice. The interior also has a cute vibe, so I didn't mind waiting. I got home and untied my tightly wound bag of lunch. They didn't give me my pastry though I was charged for it. Talk about more sadness on a bad day, especially when I told the gal how excited I specifically was for that little pastry of Greek goodness. I was also super pumped for the gyro because the menu said it had house made tzatziki. When I looked in my gyro, it had the smallest dollop on it. Maybe you need to ask for it extra, and it's not included? Be sure to confirm that's coming on it. For me, sauce really makes the gyro, because otherwise it's really just meat.\n\nSo you can see, I'm torn. I think the food could be really, really good if you order the right thing and they get your order correct. I'm willing to come back again if I'm in the area and update this review later, but I'm not rushing back.
