I stopped in here without an appointment on a Thursday at 11:00 am. To my surprise it was really busy so I didn't expect them to say yes... But they did and I only waited 5 minutes without making other people get left \"soaking\". Quincy was amazing. Best. Pedicure. Ever. Massage was fantastic, as good if not better than my massage therapist. I will be back for sure. My new fav place!!!!
