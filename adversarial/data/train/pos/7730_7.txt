This is my favorite chicken finger and beer spot!!! Kara is my favorite waitress here who is always great with service and attentive. \n\nCrown and anchors food is phenomenal for great prices. I love their interesting selection of stews, their burgers, and their chicken fingers are to die for!!! I also love how they always have soccer streaming on all the televisions.\n\nI recommend their Guinness and pear cider drink. Their drinks are awesome and all the bar tenders are nice! I highly recommend this pub :)
