Rolled in with my boyfriend and two of his guy friends last Friday night\/ Saturday morning. It was about 3:45am and there was a large party of men standing outside the venue in line to get picked up. \n\nThe venue is huge. $40 for cover?! What the hell - that's Vegas for you. Women dressed in lingerie everywhere. I've seen less at raves and Halloween parties. Completely phased. Sat down with the boys at one of the dancer poles. Some of these girls really know how to work it - which reminds me *sidenote: sign up for pole dancing class at Crunch gym*. Overall, it was fun for what it was. \n\nBoyfriend bought me a lap dance, the girl who performed for me did an excellent job (for him). She was cute, petite and complimented me on my own attributes. At a certain point, one of the customers from a few feet away took a picture of it happening and the girl stopped what she was doing , walked up to the guy, and deleted the picture off his phone. She came back to me, apologized, and told me that for my sake she didn't want the picture to be circulating around(I gave her a hug - Classy!) Watching my boyfriend get a lapdance(not so fun, seriously I could do better). The guys seemed satisfied with what they got. Unfortunately, one of them had his buzzed head rubbed by one of the girl's behinds (completely not by choice - totally not amused by that). The girl apologized and walked away. \n\nFour stars for the girl who did my lapdance and 2.5 for the venue.
