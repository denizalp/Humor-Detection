Ahh Vegas. I finally made it here in March 2014 (little late for  a review but ya know!). I will agree with other posters that the parking is TERRIBLE there, and kind of confusing. You have to get a parking pass so you can get out of the parking lot for free when you check out, but we didn't know that before and. Not that it was a big deal but whatever. Check in was easy, we booked at the front desk with our AAA membership (which I don't think they were happy about) and literally our room came to about $75 for the night. We planned on only sleeping for a few hours before we left anyways so it wasn't that big of a deal. \n\nThe staff: could be friendlier. She didn't smile, crack a joke, laughed, nothing. I tried so hard to be nice and let her know we were friendly, and she apparently didn't care at all. \n\nThe rooms: what can I say? It's like being pushed back to the 60's and 70's with Robert DeNiro as the casino head hancho. The rooms are outdated yes, but our room was very spacious and clean. It did smell like it was older, but again. we didn't care. The AC worked perfectly and the bathrooms were super clean. The view was terrible for us though, although we could see Vegas out in the distance, we were in view of a parking lot that was getting rebuilt and it looked sort of ghetto.\n\nWould I stay here again? Probably not. It was our first time in Vegas and we had driven from San Diego, so literally we were winging it. Now that I've been there and will be able to possibly book again, I'll stay somewhere else. The staff could use a friendly makeover, and the rooms could be updated. Other than that, you can't beat the price we paid split between 3 people.
