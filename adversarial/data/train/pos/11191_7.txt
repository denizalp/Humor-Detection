Everything in this truck is amazing, but I tip my hat to the Bear Dog. Peanut butter, cracker jacks, bacon, cheese, and bbq sauce on a hot dog somehow works fabulously. \n\nEach hotdog is named after a customer's dog and every week they feature a new dog of the week. Someday I'll submit one named for my dog too.  \n\nSide note, the fried pickles are pretty amazing too.
