They aren't going to fool me with that fresh fruit trick. Nope. Not falling for it. I'm one tough boba chick, and a strawberry and some blueberries won't prevent me from cutting to the tapioca truth. \n\nOkay, so I am not really a toughie. I can only keep up that act for, well, approximately two complete sentences. However, I must say that my No. 1 Boba experiences have not been epic. If you follow my boba taste, then you'll know I like it straight: green tea and balls. \n\nMy last quest to procure this simple treat at No. 1 Boba was a bit disastrous. First, they forgot my order. I watched several fancy fruit things roll off the blenders before they realized they had overlooked my plain green tea, \"no sweet\". Upon remembering, they forgot the \"no sweet\" part. I shrugged my shoulders and told them not to worry about it. However, I hadn't even made it to Diamond Bakery when I realized that this drink was pure sugar water. (They have stacks of the white stuff behind the counter for a reason: They use it!). So, I returned, apologized and said I just couldn't handle the sweet. The final green tea drink I received tasted oversteeped and not too delicious, plus the boba were slimy. There is not much worse than slimy tapioca balls rolling around in your mouth. Sorry, but I had to spit one out!\n\nStill, I did seem them plopping scoops of fresh fruit in the blenders for the rest of the clientele, and that is a nice thing. And, they attempted to correct my drink without a fuss. I have no doubt that at their finest, which definitely involves a fruit concoction, they are pretty darn good, but for straight up tea, I am not so sure. And, as for those boba... Let's just say I'm giving them a benefit of the doubt star bump for now.\n\nPretty sure you have to hit the $5 mark to use your credit card.
