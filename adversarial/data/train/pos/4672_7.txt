BEWARE!  My wife and I decided to try this place one more time since its close to where we live.  We were greeted and sat by a 11 year girl.  She also took our drink orders and our food order. THERE WAS 0 ADULT SUPERVISION.  We never saw any adults until after we ordered.\n\nWell my wife's Pho came back shrimp instead of rare beef.  The owner\/father Myles started to argue about who got the order wrong...He yelled at his daughter for not repeating the order...At this point I told my wife lets just leave but she was worried that Myles will yell at his 11 year old daughter again or worse if we leave because he will blame her for us leaving.  So we stayed and paid full price for low quality food and so an 11 year old girl would not suffer.  How uncomfortable would you feel???  OMG\n\nMyles kept asking what's wrong and well its not what you ask, its HOW you ask it.  We were talked to like we never had Vietnamese food...very rude.  He is very \"in your face\" type of talker.\n\nThis place is probably almost bankrupt since they can't afford any staff and are using their child as the hostess...its just so sad. Thank goodness for child labor laws huh?
