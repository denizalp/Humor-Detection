Who the heck added Costco Gas to Yelp? Well, it's here so I'll rate it.\n\nIf you have a card and it's not completely out of the way, it's always worth it to get gas at Costco, especially if you're one of those premium petrol people. Sure there's a line sometimes. OK there's a line most of the time. But luckily for me, my hybrid can sit through things like that on battery power.\n\np.s. Someone mentioned not knowing which side of your car has the gas intake and having to stretch the hose across your vehicle. What's wrong with that? If there's an empty spot, I'm taking it, regardless of it being a lefty or a righty. The hose and my pride can handle it.
