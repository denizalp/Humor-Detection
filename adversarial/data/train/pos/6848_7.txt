A while ago I had a bad experience w\/ Pita Jungle at Arrowhead and after that experience I decided to lay off of Pita Jungle for a while until I discovered the downtown location. I figured, a new location for me will do. Today was my third time visiting with my girlfriends and I ordered my usual, a falafel wrap. Three bites into it, it was good, as usual. Before I can continue eating, I removed the foil wrap and there was piece of chicken on the side of my pita bread. I totally lost my appetite since I haven't had meat in 10+ years. I made the waitress aware and she offered to bring out another one. I had already lost my appetite so I did not want it. She brought out the bill to me and said that the manager wouldn't charge me for my meal, well, I hope not since I didn't get to eat it. I was paying for my friends because we were celebrating a birthday so when I paid I informed the waitress that there should be a bigger discount because it's not just about me loosing my appetite it's about the fact that I sat there while my friends ate and at one point they didn't feel comfortable either and felt bad. She informed me she would ask her manager. She came back, dropped off my copy of the receipt, and walked away. Not saying anything at all. I opened the bill and the manager didn't take any additional discount or anything. What a shame. This is the second bad experience and after this I DEFINITELY won't be giving Pita Jungle a THIRD try!
