I was not impressed.\n\nAmbiance was ok. Black, red, dark. Very modern Vegas, but looked like a place where True Blood vampires would dine at.\n\nHad the 3 course $39 prixe fixe special and came out feeling hungry and unsatisfied.\n\nOrdered a melon appetizer, halibut main entree, and an unmemorable rum dessert.\n\nThe entrees came out looking like an entire tv dinner on one plate, similiar to a bento box. Um, what happened to a real dining experience? No drum roll? Just slam-bam-thank-you-ma'am plates?\n\nStaff was friendly though and I liked the wrap around bar.\n\nHowever, the food lacked the quality and substance of Joel Robuchon.\n\nI enjoyed the company of good friends, but I did not care too much for the culinary experience here.
