With the guys preoccupied with \"guy stuff,\" I was left to roam The Strip all by my lonesome. When my tummy notified me that it was lunchtime, I didn't have to search far to find a quick grub spot; I was standing right in front of an ad for Earl of Sandwich! Well, that was effortless, thank you Universe.\n\nMy Caprese Salad & a fountain root beer cost less than $9. I so appreciated the very appropriate portion--just enough for one moderately hungry girl--as some portions in Vegas tend to err on the side of REE-diculous. The tomatoes & mozzarella were fresh, but the salad was kind of drowning in its vinaigrette. Overall, it was un-special & really kind of \"meh\" but I can't knock a place that serves $5.99 salads & sandwiches.\n\nWon't be a stop on *my* next trip to Vegas, but if you've just lost your shirt at the blackjack table, *you* may want to stop by this wallet-friendly Planet Hollywood eatery.
