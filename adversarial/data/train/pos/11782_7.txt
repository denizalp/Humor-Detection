A OK, A OK indeed...\n\nHave you ever had one of those days? Those deep, dark, days where it's raining outside and in your heart? Well, try having one of those coupled with a 13 month old. Can I feed her pizza? Yes, but, is that, like, OK? \n\nPizzaiolo is great because you can pick and choose down to the details of type of crust (whole wheat for her, white for me... do as I say, not as I do, etc.), sauces and a yuuuuge list of fresh veggies. Hot, fresh and at my door in 30 minutes. \n\nThank you, Pizza Gods. No matter what fresh hell I weather, you are always on my team.
