First off, I want to be upfront, I intended to rent a bell kit form this store for my 5th grade daughter. I didn't get that far, so I think it's only fair to disclose, this review is entirely based on my first impression.\n\nFriday I spoke to a woman on the phone who was very helpful. I ended up reserving the bell kit online to pick up at the store on Saturday. I'll admit I never checked their closing time and I, unfortunately, arrived in their parking lot on Saturday at 5:03PM. They closed at 5:00PM. I have my very excited 5th grader in the car, so I thought, I'm not going to give up, yet. There were customers still exiting the store. I grabbed the door and went in as one of them exited. I went to the checkout counter where I explained my situation briefly to the man still checking customers out. He made it seem like it was something they could possibly do, until a woman walked up and immediately shut it down. She explained they could not check me out today and I would have to come back on Monday when they opened at 10:00AM. Again, I want to be clear, it was my fault for being late. They had already closed. I completely understand why they shouldn't have to help me out, but they were clearly still checking people out, so the registers weren't closed. All I'm saying is, how nice would that have been if they did help. It would have been a really nice gesture that could have gone a long way. I still have two more kids coming up behind my 5th grader that will most likely want to be in their 5th grade band, too. Plus, I'm a mom and mom's talk. I would have definitely spread the word about a place that went out of their way to help me. It's a shame. I'm all about supporting family owned businesses. They are usually the ones that make these types of exceptions for people.
