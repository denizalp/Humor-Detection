Best clinic ever!\n\nSo easy: at 7:30pm the night before u want a RDV call the appointment number (514) 360-1765 and follow the instructions, do not hang up until the line hangs up. Have ur medicare card in hand and speak clearly when prompted. \n\nThe next day u will be met within gros max 1h of ur RDV time (and that's only if they're way way way busy cuz mostly u'll be seen within 10 minutes of ur appointment time). \n\nThe docs are all super good so far. I've seen Dr. Choquette with some of my clients from work. I've seen Dr. Gervais myself and today Dr. Thibault for both me and my bf. On all occasions I was relieved at their caring and patience despite it being a \"walk in\" clinic. \n\nI highly recommend this clinic to everyone they don't seem to put any limits on where u live (I've taken clients who technically live in the east end with no problem). \n\nUntil I get a family doc: this is my go to for all health concerns. They are friendly, reliable and provide me with a sense of security that us Quebecers aren't used to having with our health care system. \n\nA model that should be translated to all clinics everywhere!
