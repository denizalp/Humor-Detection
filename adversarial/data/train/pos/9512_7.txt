Go for the grilled shrimp poboy- it's great! Crusty bread, cajun-seasoned shrimp, special sauce, and fresh veggies, hard to go wrong. Other items I've had here are hit or miss though.\n\nThe fried items aren't great, maybe it's their oil? Their catfish is supposed to be a highlight but I still prefer to drive the extra 10 minutes to Mario's. As for sides, the red beans and rice were pretty gummy, the mac was decent, and the fried okra was so salty it was inedible.\n\nPrices are pretty good. New location is clean, located right by Four Kegs. Service was pretty friendly for grabbing takeout. I'll be back, but I'm sticking to the poboys.
