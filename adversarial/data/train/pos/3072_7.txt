It's decent. Actually not really. Fresh? I wish. The pictures on this page make it look good, but my cookie was very stale. The outside rim tasted day-old and the \"frosting\" I thought was whipped cream or fresh icing in the case was hard and gross tasting. It left a nasty taste in my mouth. The place is very darkly lit and does not have the homey feeling you would expect. Also one cookie was 2 dollars and I can get a fresher tasting cookie for like 50 cents at a grocery store. Waste of time and money if you are looking for a fresh, gooey, melting cookie, and a comfy, homey atmosphere. Skip this place and go across the street to Fractured Prune, a make your own donut place, the food and service\/atmosphere is so much friendlier and happy.
