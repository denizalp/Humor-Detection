one, two, cha cha cha\nbeer and pizza delivered\nhome pizza coma\n\n\"Cha\" recently opened in the old wine bar space in Battery Park.  \nWinner!\nCool industrial vibe fits the hood. Solid beer and wine selection.\nTHEY CAN DELIVER BEER WITH YOUR PIZZA!!!! whoa... you read that right!\n\nSo let's talk about the pizza.  I had a Margarita to start.  My standard baseline.  Crust gets an A+. Thin, crispy and a nice flavor. Charred juuuust enough in the Blodgett pizza oven -the NYC standard of pizza ovens. \nThe red sauce was well balanced. Not too sweet and not too garlicky.  Also, not covered in processed\/fake\/bland\/tasteless\/rubbery mozzarella.\n\nNext I ordered the \"meat lovers\" which killed. Bacon, pepperoni, sausage, oregano. So many times a pizza like this has a grease layer on top, you have to almost drain it before eating it. Not so here.\n\nQuite a few menu options other than pizza. But the pizza is killer.\n\nDid I mention they can deliver your pizza along with beer?\nDid I mention they can deliver your pizza along with beer?\nDid I mention they can deliver your pizza along with beer?\n\nCarry on...
