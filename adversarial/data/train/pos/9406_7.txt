The movie theater itself is okay, but the concessions stand does not honor its deals.\n\nFive minutes before our 9:40 pm movie we were going to see, we went to the concession stand.  My husband got a large diet coke and a large popcorn.  I remarked as we approached the cashier, \"Boy you really feel like popcorn tonight.\"\n\nAs he sat the container down in front of the cashier he turned it so I could see the \"free refill\" tab.  I said, \"Oh, I see.  You did this so we can get a free refill on the way out for taking your medicine tonight.  Smart!\"\n\nAfter the movie, we went to get the free refill--an employee said, \"sorry we are closed.\"  I said what about the free refill?  And he said no more refills.  \n\nWe spotted the manager, Krystal, and asked her about the refills.  She said, I'm sorry we are closed.  We asked what about the refill; we would not have bought the large size if we had known there would be no refill.  She said, \"I'm sorry, but my employees always warn the customers who buy the large size that there may not be any refills at the late movies.\"  This was not true since we were discussing the refill in front of the cashier, and he said nothing.  We asked about where this exception was posted.  She said, \"Well, most customers get up in the middle of the movie to get their free refill of popcorn, so they are usually here before we close.\"   Huh???\n\nI asked about if we could get a refill in the morning to complete the deal we had entered into--she said, \"Oh no that would be unsanitary, since we must refill the same bucket that was purchased.\"  When asked if we could trade buckets she said oh no, and that I could take it up with corporate.
