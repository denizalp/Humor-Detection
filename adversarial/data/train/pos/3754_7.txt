Walk into the Greyhound bus stop restroom, turn up the heat and start rolling on the floor and save your membership fees.\n\nWAY overcrowded and by the \"standards\" of the instructors they want to cram more people in there.  Just looking at the Google reviews and yelp reviews it's obvious that they overbook classes, they don't even have adequate parking!  Half the time I have to park off property in the dirt on the back road behind the studio.  Do you want to know how gross it is?\n\n1.  Extend your arms and drip sweat on your neighbor's mat!\n\n2. I hope you like everyone's funk, sweating in their personal space for 1 hour. I used to go to ANY OTHER YOGA STUDIO and never had this problem.  They all have the common sense not to overbook their classes like this studio.\n\n3. Now face towards the side wall and bend over without sticking your head up your neighbor's sweaty !@#@!\n\n4. Awkward moments of sweat flying off your neighbor hitting you in the face and vice versa.  If they didn't pack customers in like sardines this wouldn't be a problem.\n\n5.  Book your class online, too bad the website doesn't work, even if you RESERVE your class online you ARE NOT RESERVED a spot,  they don't even honor the sign in so why even bother signing in?\n\n6. Don't trust the fraudulent free tour, come on a Sunday evening or Friday and try finding a spot.  DO NOT PAY FOR A YEAR, try it for 1 day, 1 week etc, go on a Sunday night or a friday night.\n\n7.  Bathrooms are gross and low end compared to other hot yoga studios.  Really bottom of the barrel when it comes to the lockers and bathroom.  Just check out that recent picture of the broken toilet.\n\n8.  This is like the budget value motel 6 of hot yoga, you don't want to step on the floor barefoot.\n\n9. To be honest, most of the instructors are pretty amazing, the staff was nice, but the arrogant owner has no common sense, maybe he was raised by a pack of wild dogs or something, how do you not realize that people don't like rolling around everyone's community pool of fluids? It's broken, you'll smell it.
