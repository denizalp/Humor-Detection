I really liked the vibe from the moment we arrived. The ambiance is very cool, with modern abstract art and dim lighting. \n\nWe had a super easy, fast check in. The bellman who had collected our bags from our limo, waited for us to get keys, then accompanied us up to our to our room. He even went and got us ice! \n\nThe suite is very minimalistic in decor. The all white theme was a stark contrast to the darkness of the lobby and by the elevators. It was completely different then the extravagance of the penthouses we had been staying in. Reminded my husband of an apartment, \n\nThe living room area was on the smallish side for a suite. The TV was above the desk, and the mini bar was squished in on the wall. The bedroom was a decent size, and the bed was comfy. \n\nSLIM pickins on towels! They totally went the minimalist route on that !! \n\nOne thing that drove us crazy was the lack of a corkscrew. We had purchased a bottle of wine from downstairs, but we were told that they didn't supply corkscrews because \"all the wine was twist offs\" Gift shop was sold out. When my husband went to the lounge downstairs, he was told that there would be a \"uncorking fee\" of 42$ which was outrageous! He declined....\n\nThis was getting a bit ridiculous. We called down again, and the front desk said the only thing they could do was send room service with one,and it would be a charge and a 45 min wait. \n\nHe went back down. The cafe did not have one. He went to another bartender who was nice and opened it up (took him all of 3 seconds!!) Moral of the story- get a twist off or BYOC (bring your own corkscrew!)\n\nBesides that, we found our stay to be alright. There is no casino at the hotel, but of course it is attached to Mandalay Bay so it's really not far at all. Its also smoke free which is a huge plus!\n \nThe location is pretty much as far south on the strip you can get, but you can take the tram from Mandalay Bay to Luxor and Excalibur, which then gets you more centralized.\n\nI would give The Delano a 3.5 or even 3.75 stars- not quite a 4 star.... but much better then a 3!!!
