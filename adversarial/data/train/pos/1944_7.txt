I'm here visiting from out of town and must say this is the worst dining experience at a Buffalo Wild Wings in my entire life. My server was extremely nice but lacked the professionalism you would expect as a consumer from a server. I had to ask to have the table cleared and I  couldn't tell you her name because she never told us. She was never around and I had to go find her every time I wanted something. I really felt bad that I interrupted her cause she really seemed like she was into watching the game. \n\nThe worst thing is she had the audacity to ask me if I wanted my check now so that we could leave as soon as the game was over... it's was the third quarter with 4 minutes left. \n\nThanks Brandi!
