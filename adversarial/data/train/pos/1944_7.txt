This is a tiny little thrift store in a strip mall.  Honestly, everything felt like it came from my Grandma's closet.  That being said, it's a thrift store and I get that they don't control the inventory.  That isn't enough to keep me away.  What was enough to keep me away is the woman manning the store.  She literally stared at me the entire time I was in there.  It was beyond uncomfortable.
