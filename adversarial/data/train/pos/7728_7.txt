Came back here recently for dinner. On the pricier side, esp. compared to my fav Curry Mahal, but I think it's worth it as an occasional treat. I just came back here to say that I had the best naan I've ever had at this restaurant. They were fresh, buttery, crispy on the outside, and soft on the inside. I had the vegetable korma and it was delicious (note: rice costs extra). I would highly recommend splitting both a rice and naan order with a friend as you get best of both worlds! (And one of each order per person is a bit much). I'll return again!
