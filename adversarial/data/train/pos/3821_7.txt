Wandering along Carson Street on a Sunday morning, I was getting a little frustrated. Pipers Pub looked like a 1,000 person Frat Party had just dumped it's entire guest-list inside of it. And Waffles Incaffeinated had about 4 too many stroller-clad families waiting to get in. What's a hangry girl to do?! \n\nThe answer is Cucina Vitale. They have all your standard breakfast fare: eggs, breakfast meats, frittatas, pancakes, waffles, French toast, bagel & lox, and better than average diner coffee. \n\nThis is a small place. There are only a handful of tables, but we were able to get seated right away. \n\nI had the triple berry waffle which came with fresh berry sauce and mascarpone. It was delicious! I've been getting let down by a bunch of dry and tasteless waffles around town, but this waffle was fluffy and flavorful. The side of turkey sausage was good too. \n\nService was a little slow and we had to ask for water\/coffee refills a few times. But our server was pleasant and she apologized profusely for the wait time. A party of 9 was leaving just as we arrived, so the kitchen was backed up. Understandable. \n\nAll in all, this is a great place to grab a standard breakfast. I'll definitely be adding it to my Saturday and Sunday brunch options.
