Completely mediocre chinese food in an area that's starving for more take-out places. My Jewish standards say no, but my Jewish laziness wants to go back because it's convenient.\n\nI will say that the lunch specials are incredible value. A ton of food for the money. The food is passable\/mediocre, so it's an okay choice for a meal every now and again if you're cheaping it.
