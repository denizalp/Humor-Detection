WHOA!\n\nTotally worth the $7!\n\nGo and see the red rocks and other nature-y stuff they have here. \n\nWe stopped by the visitor center first and took in the view. Started driving again. Be careful of slow drivers. The speed limits varies from 15 to 35mph. Please be mindful specially if you're driving a big car. (Almost got squished by a Hummer! ekk!) With that said, bring plenty of patience with you or if you know you're the slow car, stay to your right so others can pass you.\n\nDefinitely bring a camera! There's also a picnic spot if you don't mind the Vegas heat :D
