I was super skeptical of this place because I'm not a performer or gymnast of any kind. I also don't pole dance. Thankfully I have a friend who does all of these things and she encouraged me to give Shine a try. I'm so glad I did. It was SO fun. \n\nI did the arial boot camp which was challenging but not overwhelming. It's like a tabata where you do one movement for 20 seconds and then rest. We switched stations often and I was definitely sweating. \n\nThe beginning tumbling was easily my favorite but I would say it was more of an intermediate. We did handstands and summersaults. It was so fun but definitely not easy. You could tell he attendees who were more experienced were favored just a little. \n\nThey run specials a lot and offer a variety of classes. I wish I lived closer so I could drop in more often. The staff is really friendly and encouraging.
