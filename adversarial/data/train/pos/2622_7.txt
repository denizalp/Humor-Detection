I bought a Groupon for Bravo Bistro after reading other positive reviews on Yelp and elsewhere. The groupon was $44 which included a dinner for 2 (seemingly an amazing deal). It was supposed to include any appetizer, any 2 glasses of wine, and any 2 entrees. The groupon explicitly stated that the value of the deal was $124 (up to $16 appetizer, 2x$16 wine, 2x $38 entree).\n\nWhen I sat down to the table and explained that I was using a groupon, I was surprised when the house menu was taken from my grip and replaced with a small green piece of paper detailing the \"Groupon Menu\". On this menu, the most expensive entree was $22 and none of the large 2 person appetizers were included. My $124 valued groupon now felt like it was worth MUCH less.\n\nNeedless to say, we were furious. I asked to speak to the manager. The manager came over an acted very smug while he explained to me that this was the groupon menu that I had to order from.\n\nThe manger listened but seamed to care little that the restaurant was completely misleading customers with the groupon deal. After a 10 minute argument, he agreed to to \"accommodate us\" and gave us the normal menu back. I then ordered the Veal Ossobucco (my favorite dish and the reason for us coming to Bravo Bistro in the first place).\n\nI'm then told that they are all out of Ossobucco! Of course, how convenient. And they also wouldn't allow us to order any of the specials either.\n\nWe paid for our two glasses of wine, left, and refunded our Groupon by emailing support@groupon.com.\n\nWe'll never go back.\n\nThere are plenty of great restaurants in the Old Town area. I'd recommend staying far away from this place -- Don't be temped by misleading groupon deals!
