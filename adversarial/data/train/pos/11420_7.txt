** Pretty decently tasting lobster sandwiches but for sure overpriced, chowder tasted a little sandy. Small shop with very limited seating. \n\nWent here the morning after a pretty rough night, so maybe the food would have tasted ten times better if I wasn't hungover, but I thought that my lobster sandwich was good but not exceptional. Most of all I think that towards the end of my chowder, I definitely tasted something weird.. as if I were eating sand. The sandwiches are pretty pricey (~$20) and if I were to do it again I'd honestly probably wouldn't eat a sandwich on my broke budget. Don't get me wrong though, it was still tasty, just a bit overpriced and nothing out of this world. \n\nThere's only a small area of seating with a few tables, but whoever designed the building didn't do the best job. My friends and I kept laughing about the total inefficiency of watching the server walk out of the kitchen to the strip, all the way back inside the front entrance and through the restaurant just to serve food at the patio and go back for each order. That's a total of six doors to go through and a lot of walking for every order, when they should have connected the kitchen to the patio through a door or made it more accessible for service.
