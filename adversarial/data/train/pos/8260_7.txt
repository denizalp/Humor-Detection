Last year we went to Spain. We ate a lot of tapas. \n\nGranted I was pregnant so I couldn't enjoy the sangria, the jamon serrano, and the soft cheeses among other things...so I missed out.\n\nSeeing this option in AZ, and looking at the menu, we had to try it. Especially given the above. I wanted to indulge!\n\nExpectations were fairly low--it's in Scottsdale. Authentic tapas we were not planning to find, but the menu had promise. Props for having the offerings in Spanish and English.\n\nSurprise. This place was AWESOME. Is it exactly like what we had in Spain? Heck no, the ingredients we have here in the US *are* going to be different. But it was darn close. The menu was crazily extensive, the red sangria was strong, and the staff was super friendly. \n\nWe ordered up a plethora of tapas and skipped the big plates, sad because they also looked promising but it was just the two of us. Split the banana chocolate bread pudding for dessert. Wished they served real Spanish hot chocolate. Had to laugh at some of the ways they served things--aka calamari came with 3 dipping sauces. In Madrid, they looked at you like you had 3 heads if you asked for sauces to dip. It's very American. But I love me some sauce.\n\nSecond surprise. The live Spanish guitar and flamenco show on the small stage. We thought it would be all cheese. Wrong. The guitarist was amazing and the flamenco dancers were spot on and had the same passion. You could almost close your eyes and imagine you were back in Madrid seeing it for reals. If it wasn't for the trio of English speaking cougars at the bar, that is.\n\nThe outfits the staff have to wear are ridiculously cheesy and it is in a strip mall--typical of 99% of the good restaurants in Scottsdale. Overlook those two things, and keep an open mind and you may be surprised.\n\nFlat out loved it. Wish it was local.
