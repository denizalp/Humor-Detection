Not impressed.   Brought my car in last week as it is making a weird noise, they said they couldnt even tell me what it is unless I pay $490!! All they gave me was the diagnostic print out saying \"misfire at cylinder 3\"  I got that for FREE at autozone... Total rip off.  $89 for absolutely nothing.
