This really is a dynamite LCBO, they have pretty much everything (well, except my Greek wine - Atlantis, or my Peruvian Pisco, but I think they can work on that for me).  In any case, you'll be blown away not only by their selection of neat-o gift packs around the holidays, but also their amazing selection of chilled wines and beers.  Its not all just Coors and Canadian in the refrigerated section, oh no - they've got Tiger, Stella, Sapporo, Becks and at least a dozen others.  \nThey even have a locked cabinet for special scotch and fancy aged boozies.  Oooh, you fancy huh?!
