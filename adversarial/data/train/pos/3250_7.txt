For us, the Avenue is the perfect place to share a quiet evening, especially when the weather outside is cold, rainy, or snowy, with friends and family.  I like the overall ambiance:  tasteful, elegant and classic.  Just the right amount of noise and easy-to-the-ears music in the background.\n\nTerrific selections of wine and cocktails.  Our favorites from Small Bites menu are Mini Beef Burgers (with Aged Cheddar, Smoked Tomato Aioli) and Ahi Tuna Tempura Rolls, Soy Dipping Sauce.  Desserts are equally good. \n\nYeah, it's on a pricey side.  But every now and then, we all should treat ourselves a little.  :0)
