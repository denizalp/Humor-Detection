It was supposed to be a romantic stay for my wife and I but...\n\nVery disappointing hotel overall starting from the front desk representative.\nAt check in: \nFront desk rep. named Carl offered Caucasian family of 3 in front of us complimentary bottled waters and newspaper for the following morning for being World of Hyatt members. \nHowever, when it was our turn to pick up our room keys, the same check in rep. did not even offer us complimentary bottled waters and newspaper, yet we are also World of Hyatt members. \nHe made us feel as if he was not inclined to attend to us during the whole process. Maybe because we are Asians? Racially profiled? Nonetheless, my wife and I were very offended by his service. \n\nHyatt management needs to fix this type of behavior. Your employees need to stay consistent with their service from one customer to another regardless of their ethnicity. \n\nAlto restaurant: \nFor our supposedly romantic dinner, my wife ordered a medium well $38 filetto on the menu. However, the meat came out very dry, not a slight presence of pink, and with no flavor at all.\nThe waitress kindly offered to correct it by having the chef make another one. The second plate came and the meat was at the medium rare doneness level rather than medium well.  You call this fine dining? Even Denny's can serve better steak than this place.\n\nThe waitress was very concerned at the quality of food being prepared for us by the kitchen and immediately brought it to her manager's attention. \nThe restaurant manager kindly offered to correct it but at this moment my wife had given up. The manager offered my wife other options which was nice effort and gesture.\n\nOverall, we don't think we'll be coming back to this particular Hyatt hotel for our r&r events nor would we recommend this hotel to any of our friends, families, and colleagues. It would just be an embarrassment.
