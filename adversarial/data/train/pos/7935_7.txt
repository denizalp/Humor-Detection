Love this place. It's been open a couple of months and as a barefoot instructor I NEED this Foot care in my life and at Q-Up is my favorite place in all of Las Vegas! Our entire family comes here and they always got us in and make time. I'm recommending you come in and enjoy a cool environment that our entire family loves. And yes I came in for a PEDI! With color and flowers! Wanna see my feet come visit me @evolutionyogaLV
