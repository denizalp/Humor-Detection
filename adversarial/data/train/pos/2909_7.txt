WARNING do not go here!!!! I bought $150.00 dollars of plants here about 2 weeks ago and one of the plants had a pod on it that I didn't see and it opened and now the plant is infested with bugs. I put this plant and some pansies i bought there in my atrium where I have no other plants and now I have bugs everywhere. \nWhen I called the nursery and told them what happened they said oh well! All the other nurseries guarantee their plants this place sells you diseased plants on purpose knowing you will be stuck with them. I used to go there all the time, I will never go back!!!!! Beware!!!!!
