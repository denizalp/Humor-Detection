You know what I like best about this place?\n\nI love going to places where I am the youngest customer by a considerable margin.\n\nAnd I'm old enough to have spent the first half of my years so far using phones that were attached to walls and stuff. You know, the ones where you had to turn this twisty thing to make a call and you didn't know who was calling you before you answered?\n\nAnyway, the older generation seems to like good deals on veggies and other produce, because they usually have them here. Sometimes you can get in and out without being overcome by the feeling that the zombie apocalypse is upon us, and they are all on walkers.\n\nIn more-or-less typical Basha's practice, some of the items are weirdly overpriced. Stick with the loss-leaders and you might make out ok.\n\nOh, and also: The parking spaces are nice and wide. Wide enough to fully swing open the door of your Buick Park Avenue.
