Phoenix isn't a good cab town, and my experiences with taxis here have been really mixed. \n\nHaving moved close enough to the airport that a cab ride is usually at even cost with extended parking for a week-long trip, I decided to try a cab for the first time in ages. With Discount the experience was about as good as a cab ride could be.\n\nFirst, you have multiple ways of reserving a ride: Online, through text message, or through that old voice-communication . . . . thing . . . watzitcalled. . .  the . . . phone! That's it! You can call them and talk to them verbally using your mouth too! And they will talk back to you, verbally. And they are really rather nice!\n\nThe drivers arrive a bit early and help with the luggage. The cars seem to be hybrids for the most part, which seem to work fine. Each has the wireless credit card setup, so paying with plastic is no big deal.\n\nSo Discount gets my thumbs up for providing world-class cab service in a town that's kinda not a cab town.
