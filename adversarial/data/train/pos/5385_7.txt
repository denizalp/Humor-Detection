We didn't need Chris Hornak's list because there was absolutely no line on a Friday evening.  There were a lot of empty tables, and I didn't feel suffocated as we definitely had room to breath and move.  We had vouchers for free admission as well, and I'm glad we didn't pay the $30 cover charge for gents.  Other than a great view of the Strip, there wasn't much going for it.\n\nWe saw someone bring their grandmother into the club, and that was our cue to leave.  From the bottom to the top, back to the bottom in about twenty minutes total.
