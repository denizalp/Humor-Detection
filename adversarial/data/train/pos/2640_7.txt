This huge bar is three levels in a turn-of-the-century building. I like the vibe and the spaciousness, but the food leaves something to be desired.\n\nOn the plus side, they have vegan Cornish pasties.\n\nI got the vegan \"vinny\" vindaloo pasty ($13) but didn't like it. It was too starchy and had a one-note flavor of excessive spice. \n\nIf Cornish Pasty offered a seitan and potato gravy pasty, maybe with green onions, I'd be back. As it stands, come here for a drink and to hang out with friends but don't bother with the food.
