This was a really great show!  Reasonably priced, very intimate venue.  The show  itself was amazing actually. I'm still wondering how he knows the things he knows. The woman sitting next to me was picked as a volunteer and she appeared to be hypnotized. She swore she didn't know she was doing what we saw her do on stage.  She was freaked out. This is a very small venue inside Bally's. The showroom is also running Tony and Tina's wedding plus the 50 shades parody.  I purchased a groupon for Paranormal, made a reservation and picked up the tickets at the Bally's box office.  IMO It's not really worth the extra $ for the VIP. You'll get in a few minutes early and will sit in the first two rows.   I was seated  in the second row and wasn't VIP.   It's first come first serve seating but if you are there about 30 minutes early you should be fine.   Frederic is very personable, funny and really good  at what he does.  (Love the accent) He includes the whole audience even way back to the last row.  He picks lots of audience volunteers so don't be shy. Unfortunately I wasn't picked. :(   But Frederic did use my friends watch for one of his tricks (for lack of a better word)  I won't spoil it. But it was amazing.  The next day my friend was still asking how did he do that.  Yes we did get his watch back. :). \n\nNo food or drink can be taken in but they have a bar.  If you like illusion, magic and want to be left wondering how he did that then this show is for you. He really does create unforgettable moments.  Last little bit, it is family friendly content. Not sure if children are allowed in the shows but there was no inappropriate language or behavior.  Definitely go see if you can!
