The first thing I liked was I walked in and the deli area is amply stocked with lots of various items,it reminded me of a place I always went to in burbank. so I started asking questions about the menu and the gentleman,who I assume was at least a manager or an owner didn't exactly have answers to simple questions,which precipitated an additional extra 5 minutes of uneccesary converstation. I ordered the chicken parm. sandwhich and some Italian wedding soup,I got my dad the spaghetti and meatballs but had them sub in an arrabiatta sauce to kick it up a notch. both of our meals were very good..the soup was excellent. While I was waiting around for the food I inspected the many items they had stocked on their shelves...everything I looked at had past due expiration dates..that's a big deal for me..it indicates a lack of professionalism and selling items less fresh then they should be because they don't want to dump inventory. they could at least discount  the past due items. then there was also an overall blas√© attitude like these guys were still in europe..they were authentic they all spoke Italian but they also had the urgency of italians...slow boat from china.....these are the few items I deducted for...
