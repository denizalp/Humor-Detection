So after waiting at cox..\n\nI found that they had cheaper routers that did the same thing. Score.\n\nWalk in, immediately greeted by someone who walks me to what I need. Nice.\n\nHas to go to the back to get it, no worries, found something better and cheaper. Really cool.\n\nWorked out and didn't take as long as I waited at the Cox store.. Priceless..
