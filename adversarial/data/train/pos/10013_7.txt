Had high hopes for this place because of the reviews. \n\nWe ordered off yelp and scheduled it for pick up. \n\nIn a small strip mall and the decor was dingy as you walk in. \n\nFemale who greeted wasn't beyond friendly but the gentleman who brought our food out was beyond friendly and easy to speak to. \n\nWe arrive home and lay out our array of food:\n\nGreen chili burrito with green enchilada style\nCarne Asada burrito with red enchilada style \nCarne Asada burrito with no guacamole \nPizza ala Mexicana with Pastor meat. \n\nThere was nothing special about this food. My daughter thought the green sauce was too hot for her. (Her own preference of course, I never tried it.)\nMy carne asada burrito was just refried beans and steak meat and more refried beans. There were no cheese in any of our burritos. \n\nThe sides included a small side of beans (like there wasn't enough in our burritos) and a small scoop of rice.
