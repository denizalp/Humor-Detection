This is a primarily WOMAN'S shoe store that specializes in size 9+. Hence, why a previous reviewer gave 2 stars for not being able to find a suitable pair of men's shoes. Marlou does carry a very limited selection of men's shoes, but it is by no means a men's shoe store. \n\nIn short, this place is a godsend for me. I have spent my entire life dealing with too-small shoes and settling for \"unisex\" (i.e. men's) styles. \n\nI wear a 10-11 D-width and I have never found anything that actually fit other than flip flops and athletic shoes. I grew tired of going into shoe stores and saying \"what's the largest size you offer? A 9-C? Yah, thanks...\"  If I did come across a pair that fit, they looked like granny shoes. At Marlou's, the biggest problem I have is trying to decide which of the 6 sweet looking pairs (that fit wonderfully) I'd like to take home with me. \n\nMarlou's offers a lot of large sizes in various widths. Lots of cool high-end European manufacturers. Don't expect to find cheap, stiff, manmade-upper Payless-type shoes. These babies have soft-as-butter leather. I have never before worn shoes that make me feel like I am walking on clouds. Ahhhh. This being said, be prepared to fork over some cash. The average price is $75 and up. They do run sales now and then. But just like one shouldn't skimp on a mattress, you shouldn't skimp on shoes. After all, look how much time you spend in them. There's nothing like a perfect-fitting well-manufactured shoe. \n\nThank you, Marlou's!
