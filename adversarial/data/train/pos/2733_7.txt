While trying to decide if I wanted to check out Carolina Christmas, I checked Yelp for a review.  There wasn't one...so here I am.  I feel I owe it to the next person who thinks about attending.\n\nThe website makes Carolina Christmas look super cool.  In my somewhat jaded view it's only somewhat pleasant.  My first mistake was to attend on a Saturday night.  Lines of cars for days.  They offer \"express access\" for an extra $10...I recommend saving your money.  It moves you further up the line but you'll still be in a line for a long time.  I didn't keep a close eye on my watch but I believe it was about 30 minutes from entering the line to seeing the first light display.  \n\nThere were alot of light displays, but most of them seemed kind of skimpy.  I didn't see any light display that made me say \"WOW\".   In this age of super-technology I was disappointed at the amateur nature of the displays.  \n\nThe route drives you through the speedway area and onto the track.  Driving on a real racetrack was honestly the best part of the experience.  Definately something I'll probably never experience again so I thought it was kinda cool.   But was it worth $30 ($20 + $10 for the \"express\" lane)?  Probably not.\n\nI feel like a real Grinch giving 2 stars to a holiday activity.  I was hoping it would be really amazing...perhaps my expectations were unrealistic.  If you like to sit in your car for almost 2 hours while looking at relatively lame Christmas displays, you'll love this.  \n\nNow, back to putting chunks of coal in kids' stockings.
