Worst customer service on the bar side. Unfortunately I didn't get her name but she was the worst server. This waitress called my friend names and swore only because he threw up. Disgusting. Never are we returning to this location again. Told my family and friends as well, sucks because we live in the neighbourhood and were regulars.
