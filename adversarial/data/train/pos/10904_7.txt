My GF decided to surprise me with a weekend \"staycation\" and she got us a room at Sams Town and tickets to the Indie rock festival. \n\nShe told me Sams town was a low low class casino hotel but it was in the same area as the festival so thats were we ended up.\n\nThe staff were all professional and willing to help answer were is this type questions. I didnt see the low low class the GF spoke of but it did have a western theme.  \n\nThe bars were open and flowing but only one served my favorite the Hefeweizen. It was located in the steakhouse and the Bartender was great to chat with. Next time I will have to try the food. It looked great but all I did was down two of the largest beers Ive ever seen. I mean it was so large my arm got tired as I followed the GF from one slot machine to another.\n\nThe greenhouse\/lobby was great and the free light shows were mildly entertaining. The animals and light show sometimes lined up and it would have been awesome to see the Bear stand and salute during the National anthem instead of waving.\n\nThe buffet was a little below average as the prime rib was a pot roast at best, my GF swears they had Tunafish in the seafood salad but still kept sucking it down.\n\nThe GF saw someone with a strawberry zinger and wasnt able to find one so I asked the pastry chef if they had such a thing and she said they may have some in the back and promptly went to get us some. \n\nOur room was on the 6th floor and I lost the bet that they would have a room 666.  In the spot it should be was a storage closet so maybe something happened and they converted it. I didnt get to ask but that would have been cool.\n\nMy car was safe in their garage and since I have a drop top that is always a concern.\n\nAnd where else can you be where you can get a picture with a stuffed donkeys ass?\n\nThe
