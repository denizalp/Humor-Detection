The branch manager threatened to call the police when I asked a question about their change-making policy.  Here is what happened:\n\nI do not bank with Bank of America.  But I used their ATM and paid the $3.00 fee.  The ATM gave me a $20 bill.   I entered the bank and asked for change for the $20 bill I just paid for.  They said it was not their policy to make change for non-customers.  I said that I was a customer because I just paid them $3.00.  They said again that it was not their policy to make change for non-customers.  I asked why not.  I was asked to leave.  I said it was a simple question and asked again - I honestly just wanted to know.  I was then told that they would call the police if I didn't leave.  The other two employees started to chime in.  Everyone got really mad when I wouldn't just leave, and started raising their voices at me (I did not raise my voice or get mad - I only asked why they wouldn't make change).  It was all very, very strange.  So I left.
