I had a good experience at this office.  They got me in and out in about an hour and a half.  I needed to apply for my Social Security benefits and Medicare, having turned 65, and I was away from my hometown of San Diego.  I had tried to do it online but was told I didn't qualify for that method.  I tried to do it by phone and that didn't work either, so I just went to this office which was only about a mile from where I was staying. I only had about a 15 minute wait when I got there, even with no appointment.  An hour and a half after I walked in the door I walked out fully qualified for Social Security and Medicare. What more could you ask for? Very efficient.
