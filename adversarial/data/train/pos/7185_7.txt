LET ME FIRST CLARIFY WHY I KNOCKED OFF A STAR:\n\n-We've had two experiences with....\n-THE GIRL'S AT THE FRONT COUNTER, I DONT KNOW WHAT IS WRONG WITH THEM, MAYBE THEY THINK THEY ARE THE BEST SH*T IN THIS WORLD, hmM  BUT they seriously need to knock off that fake smile and the hello's and goodbye's that come with a major attitude. \n-They are cute, but with that \"IM THE BEST SHIT\" that ever happened to brand STEAKhouse attitude,  their faces can be EASILY overlooked and masked with a  \"BI*CH YOU UGLY\" if they keep their snobby ass attitude up! \n-they will stare at you from a good 5 feet away, even while you walk up with NO smile or grin. than wait for you to speak. they WAIT!\nas soon as i say \"party of 5\" it's like they are programmed to not say anything else! \n\"Do you have a reservation?\"\n\n-No...\n\n\"ok, wait on the side and we'll call you right up while they set up the table\"\n\n-Here i am thinking, THIS SNOBBY bitch was too bust hatin on me that she didnt even ask for a name??? how the hell is she going to call us...\n\"Uhh hey you??\"\n\nRUDE, WHICH TOTALLY puts THIS HI-END STEAK HOUSE in a bad light!\n\nAnyway, Our server was great, he was very attentive and friendly.\nMy party had exactly 5 people which meant tip is automatically deducted.\n\nSo with the tip immediately added, i would hope for nothing less than excellent service!\n\nTHE food here is GREAT, their steak is cooked to soft PERFECTION.\nIT IS NOT CHEWY NOR RUBBERY.\nWELL, DUH WITH THE PRICES THEY CHARGE HERE, I WOULD NEVER WANT TO GNAW ON A RUBBERY PIECE OF MEAT!\n\nthe bread is brought out *ONLY UPON REQUEST* SO i suggest you ask for that cause it was delicious!\n\nBUT IF ONLY THEIR BUTTER THAT came with that WERE SALTED, which it wasnt! it was plain unsalted butter with regular oven baked dinner roll type bread.\n\nnonetheless, that is the only thing that is free besides water.\nso don;t pass up the opportunity.\n\n\n*their spinach was a tab bit bitter-\n\n*their hash-browns are ok, nothing out of the ordinary, i would not pay $13 or so for regular hash-browns.\n\n*they were out of a few items we ordered! after 15 mins of placing our order than he comes at let's us know (it;s like why not be considerate and add a note in the menu, or even word of mouth?)\n\n\nI GIVE 2 STARS FOR THEIR OYSTER'S!!\n\nTHEY WERE THE BEST!\nSMALL, AND PERFECT!\nNO GRAINY TASTE.\nNO OCEAN SEA FISH AROMA!\n\nI COULD HAVE EASILY EATEN A DOZEN ALONE! :)\n\nyUMm.\n\n\nI am just really surprised this restaurant is located in Monte carlo! \nthe casino itself is NOT much to look at.\n\n\nfinal tab was nearly $600-\n\nit's worth it.
