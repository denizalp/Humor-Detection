HELLO MANAGER!!!!! I can give you FIVE stars UNLESS I arrive when the sun is BLARING into the majority of the entire restaurant during sunset!!! We planned on going for dinner tonight, but remembered leaving several times with migraines!! Get some damn blinds and we'll be there for dinner!! Until then, we will go elsewhere during evening hours!!!! \n\nWhy don't you sit your ass down on one of those tables when the hot Arizona sun is setting right in your EYES while you try to enjoy a meal!! Maybe then you will FINALLY (I have complained numerous times!!!) fix the problem!!!! I'm sure you are losing a LOT more money in profits than you are saving by being an idiot by not fixing the problem!!! It is a REAL PROBLEM that customers are noticing and, therefore, avoiding your restaurant in the sunset hours!!!!\n\nYes.....for some reason you have blinds on the north and south windows. Trying to figure out why the hell you haven't put blinds where the NEED TO BE!!!! \n\nContact me when you put up some blinds and I'll remove this review. Check my previous review and see that I would like to be a regular customer, but I guess it will be only for lunch until you easily FIX this obvious and outrageous problem!!!
