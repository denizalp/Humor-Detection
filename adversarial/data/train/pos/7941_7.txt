I absolutely LOVE this park! It such a cozy setting in Downtown Phoenix. I have attended a few events here in years prior and they have all been executed so smoothly. Parking is easy, there is a dog park, play areas for kiddos, bathrooms, and more. I also love that it is right off of the freeway and easy to access from other parts of town. In fact, the park actually runs OVER the freeway! SO crazy! \n\nIf you're in the area and looking for a park to relax and unwind with kiddos, your dog, or a loved one on a gorgeous AZ Fall\/Spring day - this is your spot! I know that we will be back in the future. Our sweet sheepie LOVES it here!
