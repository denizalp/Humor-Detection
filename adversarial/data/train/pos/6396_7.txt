AWESOME! Joining the ranks of the Leslieville\/Beaches gourmet movement is Sausage Partners (snicker, snicker, I know...) - and I do think the name warrants all the jeers and comments they will get. BUT don't judge a book by its title! \n\nDecided to check them out three weeks after their grand opening and had high expectations since it's affiliated with many other favourite companies like the Ceili Cottage, Purdy's, Kawartha, etc. AND since it's on our side of the city at Queen & Greenwood!\n\nThe sausages, clearly, are the focus. The entire shop is focused on eco-friendly, organic, local, sustainable, hormone and GMO-free, naturally-raised and free-range type products, etc. So clearly the other meats are still top quality - gorgeous - we came away spending the most on steak and bacon, not sausages! Also has local fish, as well as seafood imports, nice lamb, duck, and all your standards.\n\nI was surprised by their selection of non-meat offerings - lots of fresh Ontario produce - local too! LOVE IT, and was not expecting it at all. We bought a selection of mushrooms... yum!  They have an assortment of preserves as well. Pickles, jams, etc... and HELLO: QUINCE BUTTER. What??? Aweseomesauce.\n\nThere are casseroles and soups and such ready to take away as well, another surprise, but we haven't tried them yet. The not-fresh products seemed to be priced a bit steeper than the fresh meat and produce.\n\nAlso... there is a \"Meat Club\". I am a vegetarian, but Mr. Rosie S. totally flipped (almost as much as he did at the \"bacon sausage\"). Will report back after investigating!\n\nThey offer classes (right now, there's \"Poultry Classes\" and \"Sausage Making\"), and they currently have a great selection of holiday gift baskets.\n\nShhh... secret: they carry the sticky toffee pudding that is on the menu at The Ceili Cottage and Starfish. Drooooool!\n\nPrices are... well, prices are totally fair for the quality you get! You'll get products cheaper at a chain grocery store, but it certainly won't taste like this! The meat and produce are totally comparable, but of course the non-perishables are at a more premium price... I still recommend!\n\nLove the concept, love the location, amazing quality! Will be back frequently!
