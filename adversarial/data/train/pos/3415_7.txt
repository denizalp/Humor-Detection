Tyler m is deceptive, fraudulent and  charged additional fees stating that he\nIs too busy and would not blame us for renting from another agency. It is obvious that this car rental agency has a terrible reputation. If you rent from\nThis place it is sticky our problem because they have such a terrible reputation!
