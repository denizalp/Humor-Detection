If you hate being interrupted and enjoy getting sick from your meal, this is your place. Gather 'round, and let me tell you a story about why you should never go to this place.\n\nMy family and I went to Great Wall Cuisine for Dim Sum Brunch. What could go wrong? Literally, everything. We waiting for about an hour for our table, after being quoted only 15 minutes. We, a party of about 12, were seated in the middle of the most crowded part of the restaurant, with 10 chairs. We had to get our own chairs. \n\nI asked for water, which I'm still waiting for.\n\nThe food was pretty terrible. The only good thing was the Shu Mai. Everything was salty and dried out (probably from sitting on the cart). We also had to chase down servers to get food. I literally watched a a guy with a cart walk back in forth in the EMPTY section for 10 minutes so he wouldn't have to interact with anyone. \n\nWe saw a cart with several items we wanted on it, but instead of letting us pick from that cart, they were SAVING it for themselves to eat. With a restaurant pretty full, all of their employees sat and ate. \n\nSo, in conclusion, any one have a good recommendation for Dim Sum? Because this isn't the place.
