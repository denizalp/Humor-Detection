I was really excited to have an opportunity to spend some time in this historic hotel and I mean the original hotel vs one of the newer buildings. When I walked the halls, surrounded by the cement brick construction and arts and crafts meets the Southwest decor, I could helped but wish I could have seen this grand old lady in her hay day.\n\nThe rooms are appointed with REAL Stickley furniture, it doesn't get much cooler than that for me! The bed was extremely comfortable. So comfortable, in fact,  that I woke up in the morning with the lights on and the tv blaring. A sign of a true good night's sleep in my books...\n\nAnd the rate? Wow! $95 bucks. Of course, it was three million degrees outside but what do you expect? It's Arizona!
