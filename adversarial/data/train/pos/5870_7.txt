There prolly is some really fancy awesome nail salon somewhere in summerlin that does a phenomenal job and is way better than my ghetto little nail place BUT you can guarantee they will charge you an arm and a leg to do that. I like this little salon. Maybe they don't do the best of the best but they are good enough for me and my pocket. I am simple so a lil gel manicure with French tips and same for my pedi and a wax for my eyebrows and I'm out the door within two hours :) feeling like a princess :)
