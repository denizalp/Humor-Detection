Nice place, has an upscale atmosphere and the service was great.  My husband and I ordered a tom yum soup to share, I ordered red curry and he ordered a northern Thailand dish that was really good.  When the tom yum came out, I was scared for the rest of the meal.  The tom yum soup was horrible, I am sorry, but it was just horrible. I don't know if there was too much fish sauce or what but I could not even stand the smell of it sitting at the table.  There was nothing else in the soup besides the broth and chicken. \nThe entrees came out and I was relieved they were pretty good! The spice level was good (i like spicy, it could have been a little spicier) and the portion size was plenty. I ate all of mine, and we took some of the other dish to go.
