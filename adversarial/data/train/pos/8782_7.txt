After seeing amazing #foodporn pics of sandwiches from Zookz via direct mail and on local billboards on numerous occasions, I decided to head over one morning to bite into one!\n\nZookz offers a central location, plenty of parking, a fast-casual atmosphere, friendly service, free wifi, and indoor\/outdoor seating.  The menu consists of a variety of moderately priced breakfast and lunch sandwiches and a couple of salads.\n\nI went for a breakfast sandwich (#11).  Sadly, I wasn't overly impressed... I felt my sandwich lacked a ton of flavor despite having eggs, cheese, bacon, tomato, etc... I added sriracha sauce and gobbled it up regardless, but I don't know that I will rush back.  That being said, if sandwiches are your thing, this place is worth checking out.  I hope that you'll be more impressed than I was!
