I love this Hotel and Casino.  They have excellent restaurants for a small place.  Two fine dining (bazaar and Katsuya), a coffee shop, a couple fast food places and a night club.  The casino is cozy and has low limits.  The crowd is casual and not stuffy.  The dealers are very hospitable and interact nicely with the gamblers.  These are the kind of dealer you have no problem tipping or placing bets for.  The valets and doormen were great also.  One being from Hawaii and knew right away i was a braddah and started talking pidgin to me.\n\nI came here 3x during our last visit.  I may think of staying here next time.  Only downside is the location and its not affilliated with the big boys, caesars or mgm.
