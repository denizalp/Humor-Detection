Um's should consider changing the name to Yum's! Okay, promise the rest of the review won't be so cheesy... I was so happy with my cheddar biscuit sandwich! I ordered my sandwich with tomato and spinach, and they were saut√©ed to perfection. The egg is fluffy, and the cheese melty. So delicious and satisfying. Definitely a high step above the frozen Starbucks sandwich I wasted $4 on last week. \n\nI also ordered a vegan raspberry muffin. I intended to save it for breakfast tomorrow, but it didn't make it that long. The muffin is loaded with delicious raspberries and is slightly sweet, but not overwhelming. I'm willing to bet you'd never know it was vegan if it weren't for the name. \n\nI will definitely be back to Um's to try other options!
