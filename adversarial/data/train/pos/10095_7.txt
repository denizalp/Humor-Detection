I went to Harvest Kitchen as part of a work dinner when a few of us started at Swirl Wine Bar and moved to this restaurant for dinner.   The place is fairly small and as many folks have said I don't think ambiance is a big thing for them, fortunately, it isn't huge for me either so that is certainly not a deal breaker.\n\nThe server was great, he was very knowledgeable of the menu and rattled off a pretty long list of specials, I was fairly impressed with the pure volume of different dishes available that weren't on the menu.   What really impressed me was the consideration put into letting people know what was available for them if they are a vegetarian or even vegan.\n\nI am a pretty strict vegetarian although I will eat some eggs or dairy if I have too occasionally.  They had a few totally vegan options which I took advantage of - vegan ravioli which was delicious.   The folks I was with all ordered things that looked fabulous and no one had any complaints with the food.\n\nOverall, this is a very solid place although a bit on the expensive side, so just be aware of that.   I would not hesitate for a second to go here again and I definitely recommend then based on the experience I had there.
