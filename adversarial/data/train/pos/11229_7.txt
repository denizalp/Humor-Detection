Sunday Brunch at Bouchon\n\nWe located Bouchon by entering the Venetian main door and walking past the registration area to the right, where there is an elevator. We were told that it only goes to the Tower, and since the buttons were not properly marked, took our chances. Mysterious buttons notwithstanding, we arrived on the first floor of the Venetian's ten-story tower. The grand hallway through which we walked, with its painted ceilings, was so magnificent that food seemed secondary.  Then we were seated in the elegant Bouchon dining room, which really did look Parisian (everything about the place was much more like Paris than any restaurant in the nearby hotel of the same name).\n\nI ordered the corned beef hash with its two eggs perfectly cooked-to-order. It was sumptuous and very beefy, the best representation of the dish that I've ever had. The delicious breakfast classic was accompanied by light and crispy toast made from pain brioch√©. Currant jam and a bowl of high-quality butter were delightful, and we used them on the house's French bread.\n\nMy husband had the omelette du jour, which was \"Caprese\" style with mozzarella di bufala, tomato and basil. He declared it a winner. \n\nWe partook of both a regular croissant and a chocolate one, which were paragons of perfection, being both light and very buttery.\n\nA side-dish of pecan wood bacon was unusually flavorful and cooked just right--well done and easy to chew.\n\nDessert was a fantastic trio of light and crispy profiteroles, which were filled with vanilla ice cream.\n\nThe people who were on-duty during our Sunday visit to Bouchon were very pleasant and professional. I appreciated their traditional black and white uniforms and super helpful attitudes. We are looking forward to going to dinner at Bouchon someday, because Sunday Brunch, everything ordered a la carte, was fantastic.
