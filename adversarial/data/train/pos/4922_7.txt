First time around and I thought they were good. For a local BBQ joint, they might eventually move up to be one of my favorites. I didn't get to try their ribs because they were still cooking on the smoker. A tip would be to not go too early since they won't always have everything done by opening. I will go back sometime during the mid afternoon to guarantee me a taste of the highly spoken about ribs. \n\nWhat we did have was amazing. The chili cheese fries are everything you loved as a kid. The chili is free of beans and is made completely of meat. The cheese comes in sauce form. The fries could have been fried longer to add a textural variation to the dish, but that is just nitpicking. The two meat plate is more than enough to feed two people. The pulled pork was a little dry. I was highly impressed with the chicken. It was moist, tender, and the skin had a slight crisp under the BBQ sauce. As for the sides, the sweet potato casserole was the hands down best. It is packed with pecans and brown sugar goodness. The mac'n cheese was good as well. \n\nI will definitely be back for the ribs and sweet potato casserole next time.
