So we had to try this place to see what everyone keeps talking about and that it's a CALI franchise?. They said it was a mix between In n Out, Five Guys, and Smash Burger. To tell you the truth there was nothing about this place that stood out to me bc most of the items we tried lacked flavor. Prices are aren't too bad. Combos range from $6-$11 each. \n\nAlbacore Tuna Sandwich - The sandwich was greasy to the touch but had a nice crisp toast to it. Tuna had a nice sear to it. Came with tartar sauce on the side but even with the tartar sauce it lacked flavor and needed seasoning. \n\nBBQ Bacon Charburger - good\n\nMushroom Swiss Burger - good\n\nFries - blah ..could use salt or seasoning. Was soggy with no crunch or texture to it\n\nTempura Green Bean Fries - nice crunch to it but lacks flavor. A little salt goes a long way \n\nOnion rings - probably my favorite thing in the menu that I've tried so far. Perfectly cooked. Nice and crunchy\n\nStrawberry limeade - has that perfectly sweet tartness to it\n\nWould I come back to try other things on the menu? Yes. Did it have the wow factor to make me have to crave for it. No.
