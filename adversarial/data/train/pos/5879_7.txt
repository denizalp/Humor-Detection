My son was complaining that this place didn't have as many items as Wandering Horse. I had to explain to him that my wallet texted me and told me to take it easy on the cash outflow.\n\nThat's right, there are not a gazillion items on the menu, but here's what I tried. I had the prime rib and was not impressed. The flat iron steak was fabulous along with the mashed potatoes. The mixed vegetables with the broccoli was perfectly cooked. I really loved the Gumbo. I went back for several cups, even though the Calm Chowder looked so inviting. The seafood looked good but I was on a land lubber mission during this visit. The coconut cream pie was disappointing. The ice cream was good. One thing I liked was the water was good and didn't have that dog hair smell like the Wandering Horse Buffet. \n\nSo for $20.95 per person I thought the price was fair and will return.
