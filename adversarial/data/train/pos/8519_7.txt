My date and I went on the Vegas strip tour on a Saturday night.  A limousine picked us up at the hotel at 7:20 p.m.  We were the first couple.  The driver picked up three more couples and headed to the airport.\n\nThe helicopter ride is only about 12 minutes.  The lady who answered the phone when I called to confirm lead me to believe that the tour was 2 hours.  I didn't know that the tour included pick up, drop off and waiting at the airport.\n\nThe view was awesome.  It was definitely something different.
