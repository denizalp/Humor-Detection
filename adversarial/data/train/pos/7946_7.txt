PROS:\n+ Friendly service, guys have been in business over 15 years here.\n+ Discounts for lunch and cash payment.\n+ Location is convenient for those in the area with limited transportation options.\n+ Menu has a lot to offer, prices are pretty reasonable. \n\nCONS:\n- Upon ordering, owner said the sign of good pizza was \"When the grease drips down your arm\" which luckily didn't happen but was totally a turnoff.\n- The pizza was kind of lackluster and didn't have much flavor. Crust had good chew, Pepperoni and mushroom toppings were good but cheese and sauce were bland. \n- They don't really market themselves as an NY style spot but the decor is all NY themed and frankly this spot under delivers when I'm expecting a NY slice. Wouldn't go out of my way to come back but would try something else on the menu.
