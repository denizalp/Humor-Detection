Lunch at Indian Spices on Sixth Ave was a delight today. I walked in, got seated immediately, was given a large glass of water and was asked if I'd like to order off of the menu or partake in the buffet. The buffet sounded good to me so without any wait I took a plate off of the table and helped myself to a little of everything. \n\nIf you like flavor in you food you're going to like Indian Spices. Everything had some zest to it without being overly so. My favorite item on the buffet was the Chicken Tari. It contained large, very moist chunks of chicken in a curry like sauce that held a piquancy without being too bold. \n\nI'm no connoisseur when it comes to Middle Eastern food but my only disappointment from the buffet was the Tandoori Chicken. It was a bit dry and not offering as much flavor as the other dishes and that's a shame since it's usually the main attraction for most westerners who come through the door of an Indian restaurant. \n\nOne thing that I notice that I was impressed with is that there was only one person working the dining area. She was the sole person greeting customers, ensuring everyone's drink was okay, busing tables, and working the cash register and she made it look easy.  A lesser experienced person may have gotten overwhelmed but she seemed to have a system, remained very pleasant and nothing seemed to faze her. \n\nMy check came to exactly $9.00 plus tip... quite a bargain for an \"all you can eat\" buffet of quality food in a nice atmosphere. The slight dryness of the Tandoori keeps me from rating this with five stars but I wouldn't let that deter you from stopping in and enjoying a good Middle Eastern buffet at Indian Spices.
