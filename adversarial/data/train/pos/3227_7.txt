I drove by here so many times and always wondered what it was like.. Finally I decided to stop by for a quick dinner the other day.\n\nI started my dinner with frozen Thai Mai.  When the server said something about pineapple, it sounded sweet and good.  It sure was yummy. I think I like drinks with pineapple.\n\nFor my dinner, I ordered honey walnut crispy shrimp with brown rice (dinner choice is jasmine or brown rice).  She mentioned with extra dollars, they can substitute to fried rice.  They put main dish over rice when they serve (it doesn't come separately), I thought fried rice will change the main dish taste.\n\nFriendly service with nice smiles. I can't explain it but I just felt pleasantly comfortable dining there. \n\nWhen it came time to pay, the server swiped a card by my table. I just thought it was comforting (although I wasn't doubting anything) that she didn't have to walk away with customers' credit card.\n\nIt was weekday dinner but they were busy, so I sat at the outside patio (with heater of course...)  As I walked back inside to leave, I saw the sign Toledo 1,900 miles...(can't remember the exact numbers).  It just made me smile. I didn't know but Louie is from Toledo. I think I will be coming here more frequently.
