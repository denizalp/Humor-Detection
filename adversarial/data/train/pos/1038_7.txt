The morning after driving into Vegas at 4 am, we were a wreck, and I hadn't even started drinking yet. By 1 pm, I was looking for brunch\/breakfast spot to revive myself by way of eggs, coffee, and cheese. Not in the mood to take a risk, we drove off-strip to Black Bear. \n\nWithout a car, I would not attempt the trek here if you're not a local. It's not in the fanciest strip mall or in the best location, but the food is reliable and the service is friendly. I think of Black Bear as what I'm always expecting Denny's will be but isn't: Big servings, fresh food, fast service. \n\nOmelets, Chicken Fried Steak, and other plates range around $10 - and if you order a biscuit as your bread for any of those, you'll have invested in at least two meals; they're huge! \n\nNot the kind of place where I'd return to work my way through the menu, but in a moment of crisis, I'll definitely be back!
