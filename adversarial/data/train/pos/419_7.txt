We had a successful two night stay here. \n\nWe did valet on the car and our luggage was immediately taken out by the bell hop and they stored it for us while we waited for our room to become available later in the day. Our room was probably ready around 1pm but we didn't get back from our day festivities till almost 6. Check in was a breeze! The front desk clerk was pleasant and answered any resort questions we had. We only had to wait about 10 minutes for our stuff to arrive from bellhop. \n\nOur room was in the club tower and a definite upgrade from the last time I was there years ago! The room felt spacious and the beds were extremely comfortable and clean. I liked the island feel decor! The big round bathtub in the shower was extremely roomy and nice as well. I honestly felt like I could breathe in that room  considering I shared with 3 others girls. There was mirrors on the closet doors and in the room which is a huge plus for women sharing a room! Room also had an Ipod radio\/alarm clock. \n\nWe ate at the beach club cafe and the mini food court and both experiences were easy and delicious. I recommend the pizza!\n\nI also love the location on this hotel. It was a short walk over to MGM and very easy to get a taxi when you walked out to the front of the hotel. I would definitely stay here again.
