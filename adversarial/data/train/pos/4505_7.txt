Dude.\n\nEvie Lou is the kind of store that sells the type of clothes that I would want to stock my entire closet full of, if only I could afford it. It's like, casual but sorta trendy in a kind of army-fatigue way. Really soft oversized cotton shirts, \"distressed\" cropped jackets, hooded sweatshirts that only KINDA look like they're 15 years old and have been through the wash ten thousand times. But also beautiful and perfect.\n\nSigh. Too bad I'm poor!\n\nAnd they have really nice accessories, cool knick-knacks, and an extremely charming and friendly shop owner. (Is her name Evie Lou? Maybe. I don't know.) She knew to mention the words \"sale rack\" and I darted back there like I was shot from a cannon.\n\nI found a really unique sweater in an, um, \"interesting\" (read: unpopular) magenta shade, and she was eager to sell it to me for an additional 20% off the already marked down price. Hell yeah, I'll take an unseasonably warm clothing item for a fraction of what it cost a month ago in the dead of winter!\n\nDid I mention that I fucking LOVE SPRING? Yep. I was walking around in Tremont because of Spring. And Spring brought me to Evie Lou!
