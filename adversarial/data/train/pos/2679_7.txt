My wife dragged me to this show and I was somewhat surprised by the show itself. What I didn't like was the seating arrangement. It was essentially like sitting on picnic furniture for 1.5 hours. Not very well setup for the show. I ran into a woman the next day who went to take a picture with Marie afterwards. She waited 30 minutes and spent $70 on a doll and then waited an hour to get her photo developed (at a cost of $30 per individual picture). As others have noted, Donny puts on a better show than Marie.\n\nWhat I found odd was in the middle of the show Marie put on red lipstick and was kissing random men in the audience on the forehead. Maybe it's because I'm a 33 year old male but I was practically hiding underneath the table to avoid her from touching me!
