I recommend Doctor Justo to everyone I know. Seriously, if they ask me where to go ,I tell them. He is the absolute best.\nIf I send you there and after an exam he thinks you do not need anything done ,then he will tell you. He will not do any surgery unless he feels it could really help you ,or you really need it.\nYou have to love a Doctor like that. He is very honest and not in it for the Money. he is a very good Doctor.  I love the staff here. They are truly amazing and kind. \nI had eye surgery almost 2 years ago now. I could not believe that I had not yet written a review. \nThey told me it would not be painful. Who could believe that right??\nBut, true to their word. There was no pain! \nYes, my eyes were black and blue, purple and green. They swelled up, and I looked awful whilst recovering. But, no pain.\nThey called me the afternoon of my surgery, the day after my surgery, and again a few days later. They had me come back in several times just to make sure that everything was perfect.\nLove this place.
