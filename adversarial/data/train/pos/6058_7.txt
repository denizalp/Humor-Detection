I've been here a few times and I am a fan.\n\nOne of the times I was craving nothing but green tea treats for a whole week and went with a green boba milk tea. I really liked it and I even heard they'll even throw a scope of green tea ice cream if you ask for it. I enjoyed it, there is never anything wrong with a good cold green tea treat.\n\nAnother time I wanted try something that I would really like and asked if they could mix the Passion Fruit and Guava into a shake and was told that I should try it with Orange.  Of course I went with it and was slow about recognizing the POG combination.  It was good better than the POG juice.\n\nAnother time I wanted to try the Lavender or Black Raspberry because I sampled them on a prior visit but they were out so instead I went with a Mango and Red Bean Boba Slush which I also enjoyed.\n\nI enjoy that they offer various flavors like Black Rasphberry, Durian, Black Seasame, Green Tea, and a lot more. And that they serve it as an ice creem scoop, shake, smoothie, slush, and boba milk tea. For those of you who care they have various Vegan friendly items too.\n\nThis is their second location and owner seemed pretty cool, appreciated what I thought of the products and made sure I left happy and as a returning customer. I will surely return and bring others. Best part was that they were offering Buy One Get One boba with Yelp Check-in, hopefully still have it.
