TL;DR They have zero respect for you as patrons, go somewhere else. If you're a performer, have some respect for your fans and perform elsewhere.\n\nSame as another reviewer below and a lot of the guys who were there. We were planning on going to another club, and a promoter in a Jewel Nightclub shirt approached us on the Strip and said it was $40 for guys, free for women. Waited 45 minutes in line, finally get to the cashier, and they said it's now $70 for guys and the promoter \"made a mistake\". Too late to go to any other club, so it was either pay that or not go clubbing at all. They apparently did this to everyone on the guest list. Super shady and a pretty big scam to pull on their opening weekend to try to get higher numbers of people.\n\nInside was beyond packed and you couldn't get on the dance floor at all. $10 for a tiny bottle of water. General bad vibes because everyone were super pissed they had to pay 2x what they were told.\n\nChainsmokers were amazing and the venue space itself is really nice. But just an awful, shady run club. Have some class and accountability and own up to your mistakes. Don't just be like \"oops we just screwed over hundreds of people, can't do anything about it, sorry\".
