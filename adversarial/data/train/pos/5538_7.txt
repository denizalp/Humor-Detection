This is the best coffee shop in my neighborhood! I'm halfway through the signature latte menu, having enjoyed the Mint Mojito, Canela, and Apothecary. They must be using great quality espresso because these drinks are incredibly smooth and addictive. Flavor syrups are fresh infusions of real ingredients rather than artificial chemical flavorings. I appreciate that the hot drinks never burn my mouth, but you may want to request a higher temperature if that's your preference.\n\nThey have a variety of comfortable seating options for hanging out or working; some art on the walls would be a great addition. A snack menu is in the works, but it's just drinks for now. I'm excited to try the Vietnamese cold brew because it looks so good!
