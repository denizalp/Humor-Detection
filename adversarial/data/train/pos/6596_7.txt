I hate to give one star, but even that is generous. I went to see Ghost last night and it was a disaster. To start, they only accept cash at the bar and they don't have a working ATM. Unless you are close to the stage, you're pretty much screwed. There are 3 huge beams obstructing the view of the stage. If you are standing on the 21+ side, there are several obnoxious blinding lights shining down on you, making it even harder to see the stage, also killing any kid of enjoyable atmosphere.\nMeanwhile in the bathroom, there was one drunk girl passed out on a couch and another throwing up in the stall. Both paper towel machines were broken. The security guards were standing around the bathroom (it's one of those community washrooms), watching me touch up my make-up, giving me thumbs up. Awkward. \nThere was a drunk guy stumbling around bleeding from his face. He was kicked out, but then let back in 20 minutes later. Really? \n\nThis venue could be great but it is so poorly managed. Needs some work!
