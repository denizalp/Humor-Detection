If you are looking for cozy Italian restaurant in the north phoenix area, then this is your destination point! Just west of Bell Road and 32nd street(southside), not the easiest place to spot so keep your eyes open. I do know that they are a family owned restaurant, serving homemade recipes from the owner \"Tommy\" himself!\nReally cool how the decor is random and eclectic(see pictures), with a decent size bar area. There is also a second floor seating area w. Tonight I went with a glass of red wine Chianti, complimented with a Mushroom Alfredo plate. The Alfredo sauce was not over creamy and the mushrooms quantity was sufficient. The freshness of the flavors of the mushrooms blended nicely with the pasta sauce and wine.\nOur server was super friendly and personable from the time we were seated until we  left! Sorry I forgot your name but thank you! If you are looking for live music, come on Wednesday or Friday nights.\nCheers
