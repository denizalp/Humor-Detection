Relative to all malls of the world I've ever been to, Beachwood Place is among the most elegant, well-decorated, and cleanest that's out there. In a world where shopping malls are struggling to find relevance, this one seems to thrive with a beautiful food court, great dining options and shops I like such as the Lego Store (duh). Parking is easy. There's also this Shaitsu massage center on the second floor towards Nordstrom that offers a good heavy pressure massage if you need your muscles tenderized. I think the 80's just called and it found it's perfect mall, but with millennial upgrades and sensibilities. 4 stars.
