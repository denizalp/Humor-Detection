We love Lobster, what can I say?  I mean our room is literally only less than 5 minutes away and walking past this place often.....I mean we were bound for a visit sometime!  \n\nSo finally, we came to visit during the breakfast hour and ordered the crab loaded fries!! Say with me, \"awesome.\" Say with me again, \"awesome\" but this time rub your tummy!  We really enjoyed this dish!  It was actually a morning snack for us but we shared it and it was great!  What I loved most about this is the hot crunchiness of the waffle fries bathing in the lobster cream sauce.  The chunks of lobster with scallions and bacon just adds an extra special something.  Keeping the sauce on the bottom of this dish was a very smart choice; it keeps the fries crunchy!\n\nWe will definitely come back for another visit; wait a minute, we did come back for a second visit!  We even ordered the same dish!  You will definitely need to visit sometime!
