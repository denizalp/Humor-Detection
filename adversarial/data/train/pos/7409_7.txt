Two days in a row now.  I'm from Orange County where boba drinks infest the Asian communities. What we call boba, Canadians call bubbles.  \n\nThe drinks were decent.  Not bad,  but not the best.  I've tried the matcha slushie and almond milk tea.  They got our add-on wrong yesterday,  but we'll live.  \n\nCustomer service could be improved here.  Both visits here lacked any kind of enthusiasm.  Although, the man who took our order today was nice to let the minimum $10 purchase CC rule slide.  Ours was $9.??. \nGood location to rest our aching feet after being extreme tourists. Free WiFi,  a lot of seating. Appears to be a local hangout spot. They also have two MegaTouch screens to play games on amd a Foosball table.  Best arcade machine though,  the ATM. NoYou put in your card,  enter your pin,  and I take your money.  Who wants to play?
