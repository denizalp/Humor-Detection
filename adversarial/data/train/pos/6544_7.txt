Sadly, this location is no longer...\n\nIt by far it wasn't the best Keg I have even been too but it was convenient to say the least.\n\nI did always find the staff to be very rude, and they seemed to purposely ignore you. It was very weird service, and the lighting was terrible. But if you make it through all the motions, the food seemed to come out okay, just okay, nothing fabulous by no means. Once in a while your steak may come out not as ordered, they are usually good about fixing it for you, some waitresses like to make it personal and give you some attitude, remember its their tip they are losing so ignore them. \n\nThe reason they Keg left was because of a rent increase, now look the location just sits empty...
