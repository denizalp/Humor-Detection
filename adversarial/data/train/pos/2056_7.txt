This review is only for the food. I work right next to this place and we order food from here a lot. I've tried burgers, pizza, salad, tacos and breakfast and have not been disappointed. The prices are extremely reasonable for bar food. The cheez louise pizza is a 12\" with lots of cheese and the price is like $6.50 and its enough for 3 people. I always call my order in and it's ready in 10-15 minutes. Food can be picked up through a separate entrance so you don't have to go through the bar which I appreciate. Fast and cheap just how I like it.
