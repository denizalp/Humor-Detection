Haven't been in Vegas for over 14 years was looking forward to staying again for the 4th of July weekend. Was able to get a room at Ballys. Big mistake. The room was advertised at a fair price but when it was time to actually check out and finalized the reservation the price went up like 30% I could have stayed at a much nicer hotel for the same price.\n\nMy initial reaction is it is a dirty old hotel worh mold amd cracking decaying ceiling in the bathroom.  \n\nThe staff and customer service was mean to my family and I and was a poor representation of what a nice hotel on the strip should be. Not sure why the staff seemed so miserable but the service suffered heavily. We ordered and extra roll away bed and did not show up until 2:30 am after checking in earlier that day. \n\nAte at a restaurant in the hotel, it was medicare and again way overpriced compared to other similar restaurants. Usually I give alot of slack for businesses and always give good reviews but this one seem to screw up every contact with customers. Not just small stuff like a grumpy staff member but real major issues like mold and no beds, 20th floor even looks like the building has shifted and the floor is leaning. \n\n\nMy overall assessment is this place is over priced garbage. Pass and find something else. This will be a 4th of July to remember that will remind me to avoid anything with the brand name Ballys forever.
