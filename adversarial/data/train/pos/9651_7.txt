While this place is cheaper than the ER, this is not the place to bring your child.  My mom likes going here because you don't need an appointment and can usually get into see the doctor or PA within 20 minutes.  So, she suggested this place when my daughter hit her chin on the side of the pool.\n\nMy daughter is five and jumped in the pool, and then changed her mind.  She hit her chin good and I could tell that it was serious enough to need stitches.  As I have experienced the cost of ER recently for my children, I knew that I didn't want another big bill.  My mom called and verified that they did stitches.\n\nThey did not have dermibond and had to use regular stitches.  The PA allowed me to hold her head and distract her while he put the three stitches it.  It wasn't as easy as the dermibond, but not too bad.\n\nThe real trouble came when the stitches had to be removed.  The PA pulled on her stitch and she lost her mind.  The nurse, who is married to the main doctor, talked my daughter down.  Then her husband, the rude doctor, came over.  First he yelled at me for wanting to be near her head to talk to her.  He yelled at her.  Finally, she kicked him in the head.  (which made me a little happy)  He asked her if she wanted her daddy and she said yes.  So, he told me clearly I could not handle her and she would need my husband there.  He just wanted me to leave.\n\nHaha, little did rude doctor know was that my husband works down the street and it was near lunch time.  My husband was there in 5 minutes.  He went back in there with her.  While she gave everyone more trouble and kicked doctor again, we got the stitches out.\n\nI promise that I will never return there again.  There are other places in Henderson\/Las Vegas for quick care and this place is not worth dealing with the rude, uncaring doctor.
