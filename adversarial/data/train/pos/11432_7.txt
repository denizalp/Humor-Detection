This was my first experience with The Habit Burger and I was very impressed. I wanted to give them a try when they first came to town and then they opened this location which is much closer to home. A win for me!\n\nThe cashiers were immediately greeting everyone arriving for lunch today and offering menus to help us all decide. The menu includes burgers, sandwiches, salads, starchy sides, and shakes. All of the burger and sandwich options sounded great. \n\nThe dining room, drink station, and condiment area was immaculate. Employees were over the top welcoming and constantly cleaning the dining area. They were also checking in on diners and removing trash at the end of the meal. I hope they keep up the friendly service and cleanliness of the restaurant.\n\nI ordered the Char Burger which comes with mayo, pickles, tomatoes, lettuce, and caramelized onions. I added cheese and bacon. This really hit the spot for my burger craving and I loved the crispy bacon. The burger is partially wrapped in paper which really helped in holding everything together. The fries were okay. They were crispy, but not seasoned or anything really memorable. My husband really enjoyed his BBQ Bacon Charburger.\n\nThe pricing was more than reasonable. I would say that the prices were similar to a drive thru burger spot, but the quality and taste was much better.
