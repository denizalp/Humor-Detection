Met a girlfriend there for lunch the other day.  Waited 5~10mins seated at table for my girlfriend to show up.  The whole time ignored by the waitresses.  \n\nFinally my girlfriend shows up, we order, our food arrives with no utensils on the table for us to eat with.  I had to practically shout down the waitress to bring us table settings.\n\nAll this would not have made me give this eatery a one star . . . the thing that really ticked me off was my girlfriend wanted to have shrimp in her dish.  Paid $2 extra on top of a $6.95 lunch special.  That's a 25% surcharge.  The dish comes and I look for the shrimp . . . THREE, that's right, THREE measly, little shrimps.  \n\nThose shrimps better have been organically raised and human fed for the price they charged.\n\nI complained to the waitress.  Instead of taking the $2 off of our bill, she tells us she would take 5% off of the total bill which amounted to $0.60.\nWow, that's a big deal . . . not.\n\nThen she comes back and tells me that she can't do the % discount because the computer won't let her do that during lunch, only during dinner.  Really?!  What kind of B.S. is she feeding me??\n\nHint:  if you are working as a waitress, be honest and bend over backwards for your customers because they are the ones paying you, not the $2.50\/hr. you get paid from the restaurant!\n\nI was so mad over the whole incident that I actually did not tip my waitress and I usu. am a generous tipper.\n\nNeedless to say, Thai House has lost a couple of customers over $2.  Really, $2 for 3 shrimps.  Haven't they heard that times are bad and people want to feel like they are getting some value for their hard earned dollar?\n\nAnd please, don't feed me some B.S. about the computer can only discount a bill during dinner!\n\nTWO THUMBS DOWN!!
