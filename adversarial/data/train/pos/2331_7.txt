Let me preface this review by saying I have been to Binion's before a few years ago.  The food was great, the service excellent and the ambiance was awesome.\n\nI decided to return there with my parents (whom have never been to Vegas before) AND on Thanksgiving night for the same experience and it was AWFUL!!!!!\n\nOur server (Michael) was devoid of any emotion and seemed like he was incredibly unhappy to be working there (or Thanksgiving night perhaps).  When taking our order, he appeared to be less than enthused that we were there (of which not many people were).  When our food came, he served my mother (the only lady at the table) last.  Having worked as a server myself (and having genuine respect\/manners), I know that lady should be served first.  I was kind of surprised - especially for being a high-priced restaurant.\n\nI ordered the 10oz filet mignon  - medium rare (which is what I had last time). When I got it, the first inch and a half were incredibly well done - some pink in the middle.  It was soooooooooo dry!  I couldn't believe it!  $41 for this?   Now I'm not one to usually complain about my food and I can't tell you the last time I sent something back (15 yrs ago maybe?).  I sent it back and the next one they brought out was pink so I thought it was fine.  Towards the middle it was red\/purple.  It went from dry to practically still alive!  I don't get it!!!!  This place was incredible when I was there last and for a steakhouse (and at their price point) you would think they could handle a medium rare filet.\n\nMy partner had the prime rib which was  an incredibly thick piece of meat, but really fatty.\n\nI was given a complimentary slice of pumpkin cheesecake for my \"wait\" for my second steak which was ok.\n\nThe only redeeming quality was Jorge the bus guy who worked his ass off and did considerably more work and was more engaging than our server.\n\nWhat a huge disappointment for my parent's first dinner in Vegas (ever) and for our Thanksgiving dinner.
