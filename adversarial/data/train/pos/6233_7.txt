I paid 17$ for a shrimp creole dish. The dish was a handful or rice with some regular red sauce and about 6 pieces of shrimp. This dish did not come with any sides and was not filling at all. What a total rip off. Portion sizes at this R estuary will not fill a man up im a little guy too only 180 lbs. nice scenery inside though but a rip off I could've easily made the dish my self
