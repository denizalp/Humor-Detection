I tried!  I tried talking my friends out of coming here.  I tried telling them there were countless other places we could go.  I tried saying how we could save our money and go drink crappy overpriced beers and eat crappy overpriced food elsewhere!\nBut noooo.  They insisted on coming here.  I guess I was just the most-sober of the group, and we all paid for it dearly in the end.\n\n6pm, Saturday Evening, Las Vegas strip.  We wanted to watch some football, so we came on in at the insistence of, well, the drunkards.  Cue the confused girl asking how many, then us saying \"4, but another is on his way\" and then her having zero clue what 4+1 is and trying to seat us at a small table.\n\nNext up was a waitress with possibly the worst attitude I have ever encountered.  No smile, no hello, no attempt whatsoever at being a mediocre waitress from the get-go.  Just a silent stare at all of us from start to finish.  Cue beers that took 15 minutes to arrive, appetizers that appeared at the end of the meal, and the staff simply setting plates down in the middle of the table and walking away.\nWe had asked the hostess, the waitress, then a manager to turn one of the 10 TVs to a different game, all of which said \"okay\", then walked away.  Tried again, \"okay\", then walked away.  A half hour later we asked again, they said they couldn't change the TVs: no reasoning, no angle as to why, just \"no\".\n\nFood was nasty.  Cold burger I barely even tried to eat, wings that tasted like they had been reheated 3 times before ever getting to us, and a queso dip with, well... 1% cheese and chips that were soggy.\n\nWhy the heck didn't anyone listen to me?  This was 3 days ago, and we are all still running to the bathroom several times a day to avoid the embarrassment of soiling ourselves.\n\nI'd say this place needs a makeover, but as long as they can hide crappy food, service, and overall lack of anything to do with the service industry behind fake breasts and short shorts, they probably don't care.\n\nCan I leave negative stars?
