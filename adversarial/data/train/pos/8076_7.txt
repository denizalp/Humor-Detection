I have been going to this salon..for about year and a half..or so.  Was so impressed in the beginning...  Now??  I feel Im either going to a Halloween party..or..a rock concert!  I thought I finally found a more mature, classy salong  Nope!!!  All I see now are...blue..pink..hair color..and the beauticians are COVERED..in tattoos!  I know everyone..its what they do today.  But seriously...I still like...style, and class!!  That does not have to disappear with time...\nIm done here.  And what surprises me..is the hairdressers say..there is a dress code!  Get some class...
