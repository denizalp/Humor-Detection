I will only surrender to XS, for now.  I'm keeping this review at 4 stars only because the venue is too beautiful to be given 3. \n\nSurrender is like the kid that's still a little noob that's trying to work its way up there.  In the meantime, everyone is still waiting in that mile-long line at XS.  Sigh, everyone wants to hang with the cool kid. I don't blame them. \n\nAs my friend would say, \"all the rejects from XS goes here.\" Ouch.  Let that burn for a little bit.  \n\nWe rolled 10 deep with all girls to Surrender and we were on guestlist.  We got in within 5 minute...easy peazy like it aint no g thang.  Finally got to see what the hype was all about with this new club.  Usual cover for girls $30, guys $40. That's just silly now.\n\nUnfortunately, it just wasn't what I expected.  \n\nVenue: Surrender is beautiful.  You can never go wrong with anything at the Encore\/Wynn. Classy and elegant. The dance floor is pretty small with poles up on little stages for go-go dancers to dance by the bottle service tables.  However, these go-go dancers don't make use of them poles! Show us some trixxx!  At least my daring roommate went up and busted some good ol' tricks that woke everyone up, security decided to be a party pooper and took her down.  I guess in a way that saves me from seeing girls trying to dance sexy aka humping the pole.  \n\nThe club is definitely more of an outdoor lounge where you can sit by the pool and chill.  I came to Vegas to dance, not to get my snooze on.  However, the interior decorations were snazzy! The dance floor area was decorated with leopard print carpet, rawr.   \n\nCrowd: Pretty diverse, but I hate to say it...not that good looking. Tons of short asian guys and middle aged douche-lord types.  Sorry bout it.  Maybe it was an off night.  Not too many fierce lookin hunnays either.  The crowd was pretty tame since the dance floor is pretty small so there was only so much room to move around.    \n\nMusic:  ::awkward pumpfist all night long::  The dj was just not cracking.  He put some form of *unce* to every single song  so I ended up feeling like I was in Jersey Shore awkwardly fist pumping.  A little unce is fine, but it went allllll niiiight long.  At least my arms got some good exercise?  They might as well add techno lights and you got yourself a rave.  I need my jams with some good ol swag I can sass my hair to. Maybe a few shablams. \n\nDranks: As a girl in Vegas, I refuse to spend big money on them dranks, ya heard?  It's hot, people are dehydrated so we went to the bar to get some water and dranks.  Newp, they're not allowed to.  Naw! But you can fork up money for their tiny Fiji waters. The bartender wouldn't even give a cup of ice. Cmon now! \n\nSo we decided to leave due to boredom, went to gamble for free drinks, and headed onto the real afterparty at XS at 2am. Man, and they were still partying like it's 1999.
