My life is ruined! I called ahead describing what I wanted and they said they'll pair me up w the best stylist. I went in for a consultation and he said he has done many undercuts with designs. I showed him a pic many times of what I wanted before and during the cut. \n\nThe result makes me want to cry. After 3 years of growing out my hair and splurging on a \"nice\" hair salon a third of my is GONE and I'm stuck w nothing of what I wanted. I wanted a small triangular undercut at the nap of the neck w a lotus design. The result is 3xs the size I showed and described and this is not a lotus.  My husband and family screamed in horror when I came home and I'm still crying. Toni&Guy is not the place to go for undercuts or hair tattoos. My 2016 is ruined!
