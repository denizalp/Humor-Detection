Great experience and delicious food!\n\nWe sat at the bar top and watched them hand pull the noodles. Our server was  nice and helpful. Using the iPad for orders makes it fast and efficient. The items we ordered were perfect!! A scrumptious  and satisfying lunch to say the least. \n\nThe beef and onion potstickers look slightly crispy and dry on the outside, but the meat is juicy and the skins are tender. The beef broth is rich and flavorful in the Shang beef noodle soup.  The braised beef was so tender and delicious. Went with the chicken chow mein staple. But those noodles!! I just couldn't get enough. I was so happy with the meal. It hit the spot. Looking forward to coming again.
