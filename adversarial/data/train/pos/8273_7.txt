Love this place for spicy patties! The patties are worthy of 6 stars, the only reason I gave the 4 stars is because every time I visit the music is blaring and the air conditioning seems to be turned off or not working. They have a dining area, but I can't imagine eating here. And be prepared for a wait, if you have been to the Islands then you know the slower pace you have to get used to. \n\nI have tried several of their curry dishes, the goat was my favorite. And if you're looking for a cold bottle of Ting or a piece of rock cake, this is your place. Did I mention the spicy patties? Wow, they are delicious. Growing up in Miami, we had a favorite place to go for patties. Here in Charlotte, this is our favorite place. I usually pick up 6, and I'm sure they would hold up fine for a couple of days in the fridge. They never last that long.
