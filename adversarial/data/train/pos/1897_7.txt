Really good fast food burgers. This was my first time trying them out, loved how fresh everything tasted.  The prices were very good for the quality of the food.   I had a double char burger which I thought was pretty darn good.   Loved their onion rings and fries, next time I need to get a shake!\nI left very satisfied for the entire rest of the day.
