Coming to Swiss Chalet used to be same old, back in the day when it was one of the places we'd go to with the family on a weekly basis. I remember having a hard time trying to finish off my quarter chicken and we'd be there forever. \n\nThings have changed. I see SC as one of those indulgent places of junk food goodness, only allowed once in a long while, just like a Wendy's burger or KFC - although probably much healthier. \n\nFood came out quickly and I had devoured my plate in 20 mins from sitting down to getting the bill.\nI still feel pretty gross, with chalet sauce and gravy kicking around, eat strangely hungry and wanting more at the same time. \n\nI've also gotten take out here a few times, and they have always been on time, accurate and efficient.
