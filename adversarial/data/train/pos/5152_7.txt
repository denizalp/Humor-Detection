First time here and oh my goodness it was great! My husband made reservations for us to eat here because he said they get busy around 7:30pm and when we got there, they were packed! The atmosphere was nice, dimly lit, some dressed up and others went in jeans. There's a pianist playing as well and he sounds dang close to frank Sinatra!\n\nThe service there was outstanding! They took our drink orders and orders quickly and the meals were prepared in a timely manner. The portions of the food were great too, I got a pasta dish with clams and it was enough to feed 2 people. Food was delicious!!! It was hot but not enough to burn you and the amount of clams they placed on my plate was plenty! They also start you off with garlic squares and a marinara dip as well. I didn't care too much for the dip because I couldn't get the tomatoes on there, it was more like you had to scoop out the pieces on your garlic square.\n\nThe reason why I'm giving this place a 5 star is because of the service. The waiter was great but I have to commend the runner that tended to our table. This gentleman was working his buns off from one table to another and was constantly helping others as well. He refilled our drinks quickly and was asking what else we needed. I didn't get a chance to catch his name but he was great and for that reason, the restaurant earned another star.
