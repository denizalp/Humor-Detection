Fridays are usually a treat! Just a short drive from our flat and to the Sam's Club plaza on the North East side of Gilbert and Houston.\n\nA wonderful place where deliciousness congregates. I am talking about Food Trucks of varying dishes that can satisfy virtually everyone. \n\nThere's plenty of seats + tables to enjoy fam time, and of course the food. Live music is a bonus!
