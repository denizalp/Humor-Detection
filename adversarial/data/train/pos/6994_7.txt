I'm a huge fan of this sports book, and it's my favorite out of all the ones I've been to in Vegas (Aria, Mandalay Bay, Venetian\/Palazzo, MGM Grand, Hilton, Mirage, and The Cosmopolitan).  I hear the one at the M is also top of the line (and also where many pros hang out), but I haven't had a chance to check it out just yet. \n\nPositives: \n- Tons of HD TVs and two huge screens (one that shows the main events and the other that shows horse racing)\n- Comfortable seating - There are many seats where you will have your own screen with access to all the sports channels and horse races.  During busy days such as college football Saturdays and NFL Sundays, most of the seats are reserved.  If you are staying at the hotel, just let them now you want a spot reserved at the sports book, and they will set you up.  \n- Great betting odds - I spent about three weeks in Vegas recently and the odds were favorable compared to MGM and many others. \n- Overall comfort - It's at the Wynn...what else is there to say?  \n- The Cocktail Waitresses (not that it matters if you are with your wife or girlfriend...) - Very friendly and gorgeous.  They are always attentive, even during busy days.  \n\nNegatives: \n- The main reason I don't want to give 5 stars is because of the drink ticket situation.  These guys are cheap asses.  I've heard that you need to bet $200-$300 for just one drink ticket, but I don't know what the answer is.  I never got a drink ticket for betting under $200, but there were times I would bet $500-$600 and I wouldn't get anything.  Maybe I should have asked, but if I place a decent bet, I shouldn't have to ask for a drink ticket. \nAfter I cashed out a few grand one time, I was tempted to tell the manager that I could now buy hundreds of his drink tickets and he should stick them up his ass.  But of course I didn't because I didn't have the balls to, and besides this complaint, the workers and managers are actually really friendly...  \n\nOverall, if you are looking for a great place to hang out, drink, and watch\/bet on sports, the Wynn sports book is one of the best places to head to.
