All right.  So this place isn't awful, though, it could perhaps be better!\n\nI've been here a handful of times, and apparently they can't do 'that' bad of a job because this moron keeps returning.  When someone says \"How would you like it?\", you give an answer which is descriptive, but somewhat simple, especially when you have hair which is no longer than 1\" in length.  Based on that, you'd think that a 'trim' couldn't be too screwed up, right?  The haircut rarely had and shape to it, and has a plenty inconsistencies --I guess this isn't so bad if you're going for a spiked punk style rocker look.\n\nI think I'd say out of the 3-4 times my son and I have visited this place, they have managed to get my sons wrong maybe 2-3 times.  When I say \"get it wrong\", I mean that I asked for my sons hair to be cut slightly above his eyebrows, and when they're done (yes, they all tend to do the same thing) the hair is slightly along his hairline giving him the appearance of having a bowl placed on his head, then they cut around the rim --did someone say German helmet?\n\nIf you just want your hair cut and don't care too much about the detail, then this place should work.  If you're in any way particular or even have some expectation of what you want it to look like, this might not be the place for you.\n\nI'll probably go here again because I like the new-age punk look, my son; however, he's going somewhere else.
