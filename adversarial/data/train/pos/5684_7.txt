OMFG I love the Sparrow. I stupidly waited 45 minutes to get into Lawrence, was still 7th on the list and then my stomach told me \"F*&k this noise\" and I walked a block down to Sparrow where I had what was quite possibly the best brunch of my life: eggs benedict, nom nom. It was nestled on a buttery, home made biscuit topped with perfectly cooked asparagus and just the right amount of hollandaise. There were home made tater tots on the side (SO yummy!) and the latte I had with it was absolute perfection. The prices are right, service is great and the location cannot be beat. Too bad the place was 3\/4 hipster, but I was able to ignore them and look out the window.
