So... you're telling me I have to hold my 2 month old baby in my lap for the duration of the 8 hour ride, instead of in his car seat, because the seats MIGHT get full?  So far the bus is still empty, hours into the trip. Can you say \"safety violation\"?\n\nTwo exhausted parents on a red eye trip cant catch any zzzz's safely with a baby in their arms. Someone should sue greyhound, and I'm KINDA hoping its me.
