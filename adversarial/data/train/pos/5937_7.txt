Do I shop at Vons? Not really. Do I vote at Vons? Yes! I have shopped at this store previously, and it is big, clean and features a Panda Express, which is a rather nice amenity. Generally, though, I think Vons is a bit more expensive than my usual grocery spots, so I usually head elsewhere on the rare occasion I buy food stuffs for my kitchen. \n\nHowever, they deserve a big, full, five stars for hosting early voting. It is a much appreciated contribution, and I just wanted to say thank you! I went to vote yesterday, and the process took 30 minutes total. Even better, I could have grabbed some Panda Express to celebrate my civic accomplishment (but I didn't). Thank you, Vons!
