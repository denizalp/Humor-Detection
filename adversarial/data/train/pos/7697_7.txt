Still like the concept and the pizzas are good tasting, however call ahead since they do tend to run out of toppings.   I don't get this though, you are a pizza place and you ran out of pepperoni?  Another location ran out of tomatoes and basil.  So just call ahead if you are looking for a particular topping.\n\nAnother turn off is some of the staff, and this is an ongoing concern at both locations I have visited, so it is not an isolated issue.  Most of the staff I feel needs more training in service and cleanliness.  The lady prepping our pizza had an apron that I believe was white at one point, but due to her constant whipping her hands on it to grab the next ingredient, her apron was disgusting.  I mean grab a towel or something.   They grab all the ingredients with just a wipe on the apron and it is a problem if you don't like blue cheese or didn't order crushed garlic.  The way they currently grab the ingredients, someone is going to get a mixture they didn't order.  \n\nAgain I still like the concept here and the quality, just wish the staff were a little more attentive and more knowledgeable at what they are doing. I don't think that just because a pizza can cost you under $10 bucks here this should hinder the service.
