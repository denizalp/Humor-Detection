Seriously unhappy with this place, after a year and four months. No customer service, nothing special about this place. I was recently in a bind and needed them to cut my padlock ... or borrow a pair of cutters. The fee, for that, is apparently $51.00 to help you out of a bind when you loose a key, even if you're buying a new lock from them. That's taking advantage of people in my book, for a few minutes of effort. I rarely rant on yelp, my experience this morning is deserving of it and I agree with previous reviews, the front desk folks could use a lesson in friendliness, service and outside the box thinking. No good.
