Even though we had reservations, we were directed to sit at the bar or wait for a table. The bar was an interesting choice, because we could see everyone preparing the food, but it would have been nice to have had something a bit more intimate.\n\nThey waste a lot of gloves. Like a lot. I think we saw one guy throw away a pair of gloves at least every minute we were sitting at the restaurant. Doesn't seem very environmentally conscious.\n\nMy friend got the brussel sprouts, but she didn't finish them, which seemed a bad sign.\n\nWe shared the chicken karaage and pork belly sliders. The chicken slider needed something more acidic to accompany it. It was just okay. The pork belly slider was much better, but there was too much hoisin sauce and it overpowered the entire thing.  \n\nI also got the ramen, and the pork belly in this was perfection.\n\nAfterwards, we went to Milk Bar. I tried the crack pie, the compost cookie, and the cereal ice cream. The ice cream was not to my liking. I threw it in the trash. That was my fault, because I should have tasted it first. However, I love ice cream - like I should marry it, love it - so there was no reason for me to believe I would toss it all in the garbage. But that's what I did - totally gross.  The cookie was interesting, because it had all kinds of textures and flavors. And the crack pie, while delicious, made me feel like I was killing myself with sugared butter. It's definitely something to share.
