waitress was doing the busboys job and accidentally brought us more waters, she said something like no harm in having more waters and left them there\n\nShe brought our pastrami burger and fries and wasnt looking when she was putting our plate down at an angle and some fries slid off, she didnt apologize or offer to give us more ...I didnt buy food to eat less of it, its already overpriced as is!  \nthen she tried to take away my plate of fries while i was grabbing some and she was like 'oh, you're not done?' Obviously not if my hand is on the plate grabbing some fries!\n\nbuger was good, nothing spectacular that stands out from any other pastrami burger places....the fries were overcooked and some were dark brown\n\nnever again!
