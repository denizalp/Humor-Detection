I've been spoiled on stateside Hofbräuhauses after having been to the original in Munich. \n\nIt's debatable whether it's fair to, for example, review a Vegas BBQ joint poorly \"because there's better BBQ in Memphis\" or something like that. We've all read those reviews, and I get it, but I still think that it's lousy practice to review something on what it could be, rather than what it is. \n\nHofbräuhaus is a little different. Its explicit goal is to exactly replicate the Hofbräuhaus Munich in every way (even down to the fake bier garten and design of the building). Quote from website: \"As an exact replica of the legendary Hofbräuhaus in Munich, Germany, we take great pride in giving you an experience as authentic and unforgettable as the 400-year-old original\" \n\nOK Hofbräu, you have set the bar high - so I will evaluate accordingly. \n\n1. Ambiance: 3\/5... decent job of creating the German bierhaus feel, but the fake patio doesn't do it for me, and the super high ceilings make it feel like a cafeteria. Not Hofbräuhaus-y. Nice band though, especially if you like \"roll out the barrel\" and \"the chicken dance\"... a lot.  \n\n2. Service: 4\/5.... friendly and quick service, but the ladies can't hold as many steins as those German frauleins can. Also they don't have pretzel girls walking around. Bummer. \n\n3. Food: 3\/5... it's hard to screw German food up. And they don't. But let's be real... no one comes here for the food. \n\n4. Beer: 4\/5.... all imported from the Germany Hofbräuhaus. But the authenticity points gained here are offset but those you lose from actually making it in house.  \n\n5. Price: 2\/5.... WAAAAY overpriced. Even more than the original. This is really what keeps me from coming back more often. \n\n6. Paddlings: 5\/5... I can't personally attest (I swear!)... but these ladies can swing a paddle. Be careful what you ask for if you've had a few steins and think the whole Yager shot followed by the paddling sounds like a good idea. The last one I heard echoed twice. \n\nOverall a solid three. But if you take their claims to be an \"exact replica\" at face value you'll leave a little disappointed.
