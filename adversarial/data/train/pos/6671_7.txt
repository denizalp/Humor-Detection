So it was my birthday. My lovely fiance looked on Yelp and saw that this place supposed to be good. \n\nI say yeah sure whatever lets go. We arrive the place has great ambiance, wino theme with some rustic touches. I think great this is neat.  We order our drinks  and our bruschetta.  \n\n The bruschetta was great    Before hand we ordered our meals, the fiance got the bacon wrapped quail. I got the stuffed pork chop. Thinking this place has such great reviews this should be good.\n\n As I cut into my meal  it looks okay from the outside, it's stuffed so no worries. I further investigated my meat and it was PINK. Which makes me automatically lose my appetite. My fiance was concerned with how small the bird was for the price.  We tell our waitress , Jennifer who was great.  \n\nShe comes back asking if I want a new one or a refire on the pork. I just respond I was done and that was it.  The fiance states for 2 oz of quail wrapped in 2 pieces of bacon and a few fork fulls of greens it wasn't worth the 19 dollars.\n\n Overall I am not thrilled with what I ate. Especially with the protocol on how to cook meat. \n\nI will be kind and give 2 stars for Jennifer she was dope.   If I end up puking tonight or get a tape worm, this will be a one star vote.
