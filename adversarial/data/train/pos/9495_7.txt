I really enjoyed my experience here. I had breakfast for my first visit. I had the 4 cheese omelette with extra crispy bacon on the side and fruit with a biscuit. The food came out fairly fast and what was cool is we didn't have to get up from our conversation to get it inside as we sat outside. \n\nThe sweet lady brought us out our food and it was hot and took care of us as needed. Outside on the picnic tables were great and I loved the trees and all the shade to have an enjoyable meal. \n\nI was maxed out full and the portions were just right. I like the peace sign and the overall vibe and ambience.\n\nI did get a little impatient as I was trying to read the menu on the tv screen when ordering and it kept transitioning to a different screen off the menu. I didn't see any paper menus so just tried to figure it out and make a decision before it switched. \n\nIf I'm ever in the area again as it is quite for me to drive, I will be back for sure and try other items.  I haven't been for lunch but would think the food has the same quality.
