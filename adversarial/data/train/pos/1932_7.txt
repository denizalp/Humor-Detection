For a Malaysian restoran, I meant restaurant, the food is the best around town.  I've been there 5-6 times and not one dish disappoints.  Try the Rotti with plain curry (without anything), it's cheap and good!  The seafood Dong Yum Gong soup is very good!  Also the drinks are not expensive for that kind of quality, so don't forget to try that.  \n\nCONS: Service can be slow sometimes, and they don't open on mondays.  These could also be pluses.\n\nWhat the hec is restoran anyway, I have to call the owner to tell them about the spelling mistake. It makes them look stupid, but I don't mind as long as the food is good!
