We stopped by here on the way home to satisfy my special lady wife's need for sweets after two stops indulging my own beer needs. \n\ni was surprised at the crowd just before 9 o'clock on a Thursday night. i really had not read anything about this place and had driven by countless times having no clue it even existed. The cluster of ooglers and droolers deciding what to order wasn't ideal, but some dude took our order and moved us along.  i just told him i wanted something chocolate and chocolate with some chocolate. Whatever he picked out was perfect. The chocolate mousse-stuff went nicely with my Abita Jockamo IPA and the latest episode of Big Brother. All in all, our order was like $13 for 2 little bites and two bigger treats. Thanks be to the Entertainment Book for $5 off, bringing the total to $8.
