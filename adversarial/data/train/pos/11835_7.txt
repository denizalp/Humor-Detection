Being a big comics fan that has lapsed in recent months due to money issues, I am embarassed that yesterday was the first time I had visited a comics shop in some time. \n\nCentury III Mall is dying, and I hope ND Comics doesn't die with it, because this is a very nice store. It looks even nicer than when I was last here a year ago. It's clean, well-litt, and there are comics, statues, and toys gorgeously displayed everywhere. The selection of new and old comics was great too. I mean, man I was a kid in the Chocolate Factory.  The clerk was really cool as well What this place isn't is a museum or a porn shop staffed by misfits.  Eh, it's a stereotype, I know. Been dealin' with it my whole life. \n\nHopefully when Century III finally crumbles (thank Heaven) this satellite of the ND Comics franchise will find another home. South Side could really use a comics store. What a home it would find on Carson. \n\nThey had a copy of Avengers #1 on display also!!!!! A holy grail!
