This has got to be one of the worst burgers I've ever had in my life. I don't usually leave bad reviews because I try not focus on the negatives but I can't let this one go. \nMaybe I visited on an off day but It was just bad. The meat was rubbery and dry and tasteless. The sauces and the ingredients were not fresh at all. \nI added guacamole to my burger and you couldn't even taste the guacamole. \nThe custom hero sauce is basically salad dressing. \nThe cheese doesn't taste like cheese.\nI never ended up eating the whole thing which is always sad.\n\nThe prices are just too high for what it is and I was really let down by this place. Might give it another go with people who enjoyed this place. They will know what to order.
