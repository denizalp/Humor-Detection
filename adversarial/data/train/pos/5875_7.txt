We had a great time! 3 stars is for the river! Coming back requires a little effort. When returning the tubes I had all 4 in hand... 3 large and one for a cooler and dropped one upon returning It... guess this pissed the employee off...her response was \"can you hand it to me! I'm sorry I didn't hand it to you under your counter...my hands to hand it to you were full! I gave my first and last name to return and get my ID back. This is when I realized she was really pissed and treated me like shit! When coming back with my ID after giving her my first and last name she insisted on ball busting me for my middle name for release! Regardless of picture! I get this review will effect nothing, but for whoever hires or reviews this... you have some self in titled or higher then mighty  attitudes working for you...this experience has taught me its better to save and buy my own then to rent from you...2 passes =$16... one truck on top one on the bottom. And I don't have to deal with your cappy return service!
