I'm not going to lie, I have no idea what the hubbub is about this place.  I even gave it an extra star than I feel it deserves because of how old it is.  It is exactly like a tiny gas station market you find when driving cross country and your almost out of gas so you HAVE to stop there... But this place has no gas and not as nice.\n\nI'm also fairly annoyed because another person reviewed this place saying what the business card says about horse tack.  So when I searched \"tack\" on yelp that came up. I went there and all this place carries is soda and waistline pushing snacks??? \n\nTRUST ME... I am VERY into hole in the wall places, and am totally game to avoid the monster chain markets like Fry's or Safeway. But this place is worse than a gas station to me.  I understand the vibe and flair but they are clearly misrepresenting themselves  on their business card.  It even said they had ANTIQUES.  THERE ARE NO ANTIQUES!!! This place IS an antique... That is all. \n\nLet's just say I won't be going back... Charm does not make up for lack of product.
