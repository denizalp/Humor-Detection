Craved for oxtail soup around 2am. Market Cafe is usually where I go whenever I want a large portion of oxtail soup that's super meaty. However as always, there was a long night on a Tuesday at 2am... Did not have the patience to wait. Decided to yelp & found this place! Perfecto! Short line and express service. Got our food and finished it within 30 minutes. Ordered oxtail soup, it was just as meaty as market cafe, however the broth was a little more salty, but no problem! Eat it with rice and it will balance out. Also tried the loco moco... Not a fan. It was salty. I wanted spam musubi but they didn't have so we opt for the loco moco. I enjoyed the oxtail soup though and prob would be coming back if I ever crave oxtail soup again.
