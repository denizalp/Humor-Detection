Is Baked Bear really worth waiting for in line??  I can't tell because I'm still waiting here for the last 45 minutes...so after 1 hour and 15 mins of waiting in 103 degree weather outside, in my opinion it's not worth waiting for. I found out what the real issue of the long line! It's not because the ice cream is really good, it's because the servers have no sense of urgency.  They take their time like not realizing there are about 50+ people outside waiting in the heat on a Saturday night!!\n\nIn fairness to the servers, I'm pretty sure they're probably very tired servicing all these people.  No where in sight do I see a manager or at least the owner managing the craziness of their place.  Must be on vacation or sitting somewhere with central air...must be nice...
