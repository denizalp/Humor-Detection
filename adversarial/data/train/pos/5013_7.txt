Could I give this place NO STARS???\n\nMy girlfriend and I head in and sit down with a group of friends already there. We smile and wave at the waitress to let her know more people joined and she purposely makes us wait at least 10 minutes.\n\nI am not a fan already... but yes, it gets worse, people. She brings our drinks out after another table sits down and orders theirs. Our friends are catching on and order a round. Get them before ours. Gosh, does she discriminate against blondes?? I am wondering. Our food comes out cold and I asked for extra ranch for the wings. Didn't get it.\n\nAt this point I go up to the manager and ask if the gal is super busy tonight or if something is up in the kitchen. No, and no. I tell him what's going on and he tells me he'll come out in a moment.\n\nOh... that moment was priceless. He actually said we were rude to her and should be lucky she even continued to serve us. He must be screwing her so I am OUT OF THERE! My tip to folks. Sit at the bar if you must go. There are plenty of other spots out there that will treat you wayyyyyyyy better, have better service, food and prices.
