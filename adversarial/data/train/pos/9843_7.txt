I'll start by saying we had one of the best servers I've ever come across while dining. Not only was he super friendly and attentive but had a great sense of humor, made great recommendations on dishes to consider and avoid. The use of his adjectives like \"Narnia\" and other fantasy words made ordering quite fun. His name is Andy. \n\nIt's hard to find a restaurant in old town Scottsdale that has decent spirits so much to my surprise this place had old raj gin, so I ordered it on the rocks. \n\nIn terms of ordering food I was in between the fried chicken and the Thai baby back ribs. I ended up ordering the ribs because they came with mac & cheese from \"Narnia\" and were highly recommended. The ribs were fall off the bone kind of ribs, and some of the better ones I've had in recent memory. You always know a good rib when no meat sticks to the bone and these were exactly that.\n\nI was also able to try a piece of my friends filet mignon and it was fantastic. I'm pretty sure the group had a memorable meal but mostly due in part to our server. If you find yourself in old town and are looking for a good old American style bistro this is a solid option.
