I've been a few times, bargain hunting, and some of those have been awkward because of the sales style they employ, but I've successfully found some good quality and reasonably priced pieces. If you go in uninformed and are a bit meek, I'm sure you could end up with a not so good experience, so some advice based on my own:\n1. Know what you're doing and looking for when you go in. Bring someone with you if possible. It's a high pressure sales environment, having someone skeptical by your side as a second pair of eyes can help.\n2. Don't buy the first time. Get out of there and think about it. Check the price elsewhere. OMG the pressure sometimes.\n3. Tom and his son appear to knock the price down a bit as a matter of form, but if they don't offer make sure you ask. For that matter, don't buy when Tom Sr. isn't around, he appears to be the chief discounter.\n4. Know what you're looking for and be particular with your alterations. Their tailors act quickly and know what they're doing, but default to a traditional fit. If you want a traditional fit, that's quick and easy, otherwise no...\n5. Don't even look at accessories. They appear to be like popcorn at a movie theatre. Maybe I'm just spoiled by internet prices, but I can't bring myself to pay $50 for a pocket square.\n6. Don't expect to find the latest stuff. Parts of the store are a time machine. You can make it work, but you have to know what you're doing.
