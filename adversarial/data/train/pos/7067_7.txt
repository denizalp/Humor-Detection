Her heart keeps going and going.....\n\nOn a recent trip, I had the opportunity to take in Celine Dion's second Las Vegas residency, aptly titled \"Celine\", at the Colosseum at Caesars Palace.  \n\nHaving attended her first residency in the mid 2000s, I was clearly not as excited as my mom.  However, my attitude gradually changed as Mrs. René Angélil soon proved why she is one of the top draws on the Vegas strip.  Celine's charismatic personality, love for her craft, as well as her timeless songs are a true testament to her longevity in the music business.\n\nThe show began with a personal touch:  a montage of video snippets of fans worldwide lip-synching to her hit, \"I Drove All Night.\"  Audience members were treated to the video in which people, young and old, male and female, sang their hearts out and expressed their love and support for Celine.\n\nCeline then appears alone on stage and immediately segued into \"I Surrender\", where it was revealed in the middle of the song (the curtain dropped) that she was accompanied by a full 26 piece orchestra.  I smiled at this vast improvement on her first residency, where the band was entirely hidden from the audience beneath the stage.  \n\nI absolutely enjoyed this show as it was more personable, as she chose to share photos and video from her home life, and interacted with the audience on a more intimate scale.  Though her dialogue seemed pre-rehearsed, she didn't stray from the fact that she appreciated the support from her fans and it was her pleasure to perform for all of us that evening.  \n\nI think my favorite part of the show was her acoustic set, where she performed \"I'm Alive\" and \"That's The Way It Is\" among others.  I loved it!  Just Celine and a few of her musicians up close and personal with the audience.  It was awesome!  Another aspect that was quite admirable and entertaining all at the same time, was avid support from Celine's back up singers.  Her male back up singer, in particular, shared duet duties with Celine on her 1991 hit, \"Beauty and the Beast.\"  For me personally, that was a definite highlight of the show.  \n\nAn unexpected surprise was when she sang \"Immortality\", her duet with the legendary Bee Gees.  She began the song on the lower level and slowly made her way to the stage, all the while smiling and taking what seemed like hundreds and hundreds of selfies with audience members\/fans.  Her journey through the crowd was broadcast on the video monitor so the entire auditorium was able to view this very humbling spectacle.\n\nThrough all the wardrobe changes and the many hits she performed, she remained composed, vibrant, and lively.  And though there are currently many challenges in her personal life, she continually mentioned her husband and family as a source of strength that helped her to return to the Las Vegas stage.\n\nTo conclude, the last song was a beautiful performance, and a very poignant way to end the show. And no, I am NOT talking about \"My Heart Will Go On\", which incidentally included an aquatic element that reminded me of its Titanic origins.  \n\nBOTTOM LINE:  Celine Dion's show-stopping performance in her second Las Vegas residency proves, yet again, why she is top earner among Vegas shows.  Celine and her team have created a show that is entertaining, yet personal, and it is a production that they should all be proud of overall.
