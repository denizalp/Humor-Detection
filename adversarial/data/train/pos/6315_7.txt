This might not look as fancy as the Wynn from the outside, but the inside of this hotel is gorgeous! Luxury at its finest. It sort of blends in w\/ Aria & Vdara, being that it's a big tall glass building, but don't let that deceive you.\n\nInitially when we first went in, we were a little lost because the lobby had nobody downstairs to greet you and direct where to go. We just followed other ppl into the elevator. The elevator was confusing at first because it didn't have different floor #'s like most elevators (1-30,etc) It was just like 3 buttons (sky lobby, some other stuff I forgot). It's easy to get lost here, but the staff are so professional, friendly, and helpful.\n\nWe went to their tea lounge and it had a great view of the strip! It's a chic yet classy asian themed hotel. Like most have said, there are no loud toursists and casino in here. It's a getaway from your getaway in vegas haha. Very quiet inside and peaceful, gives a zen like vibe! The rooms are really clean and you even get bath robes :D
