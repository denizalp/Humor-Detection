Löwenbräu my first import back in the 70's Ya, they don't got it. \n\nBut what they do have is my favorite import in 2012. Trappist beer, brewed by Trappist monks in Monastery brewhouses, from different religious orders that have existed across Europe since the Middle Ages.\n\nTonight tho, I filled up my growlers.\n\nCount Hopula brewed at SanTan Brewing Co. Phoenix, is an American Double, Imperial IPA  with a 7.50% ABV. Boasting a deep red, nutty color with loud Simcoe hop bitterness balanced with an eternal roasted malt, Count Hopula Blood Red IPA certainly bites and will turn you into a zombie hophead. Not all that crazy over this one.\n\nEbenezer Ale, BridgePort Brewing Co. Portland Oregon. Winter Warmer with a  6.40% ABV.  Pours a deep ruby-tinged copper, mostly clear. A malty nose, spice and caramel sweetness, hint of alcohol, floral hops in the background. Not bad, but not spectacular as winter warmers go but a good sipper.\n\nLast week I bought Dogfish Head 60, a six pack for a buck a bottle.
