Are you looking for a hot mess Sunday full of good food, drink, and shenanigans? Then Banter is your place! I stopped by with a friend on a Sunday afternoon after a workout and we enjoyed their fried chicken sausage sandwich and their chicken paprikash poutine (just be aware that they salt everything so if you don't want salt on your fries or cheese curds tell them when you place your order). We also enjoyed their beer and wine selection. \n\nHow was this a hot mess? A random guy sat next to me at the bar and started chatting with me, turns out he is the brother of someone I know. Next up some friendly people from Memphis and Greenhouse Tavern showed up and shared their three bottles of wine with us. Dropping of glasses, beard inquires, harassment of staff, and awkward compliments to other patrons may have then transpired. The kicker was when one of the cooks told me we went on an OkCupid date together about 1 1\/2 - 2 years ago. It was not the greatest of dates and once the realization hit me I immediately ran out. \n\nI will definitely be back because the food was good, the atmosphere friendly, and the other customers a riot, but probably not on a weekend when Jeff is working, well, unless I have my hair and makeup done and I am wearing some sexy number...\n\n\n\n\n***Update: They should make dessert poutine!! Churro fries with chocolate and marshmallows or toasted pound cake fries with fruit topping and mascarpone cheese! I know, I am a genius.
