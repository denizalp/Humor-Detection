I'm an insanely picky eater because I was raised by parents who said, \"If you don't like it, just leave it on your plate.\" Because of this I refuse to eat a whole manner of things and the majority of the time, I look at a menu and say, 'I have no idea what that is, I am not putting it anywhere near my mouth.'\n\nHowever, my little trip to Harbord Bakery was one of the rare times where I just wanted to try everything, no matter how odd it looked (the last time this happened it was with food carts and street meat, so consider this a step in a classier direction). \n\nI bought a few different things: Some chocolate roll cookies, some peanut butter cookies for my boyfriend and a loaf of cinnamon raisin bread. The cinnamon raisin bread is fabulous! It tastes a bit like a cinnamon brioche, I think. Light and fluffy and amazing toasted and smothered with my best buddy butter. The chocolate cookies disappeared in a scarfing-frenzy after a trip to the gym. They could have been a little chocolatier (word? I think not!) but I didn't exactly put the bag down to come write this review...\n\nThe peanut butter cookies, I have no idea. Peanut butter and chocolate\/any kind of sugar is not a cause I support, nor do I feel peanuts have any place on a dessert menu. It's nothing against peanut butter, me and peanut butter go way back, It's just a personal movement with little, uh, movement. It's something that has remained solid through my transition from 'picky eater' to 'grown-up that eats leaves and other green things.' My boyfriend liked them though! They sounded quite crunchy? Sorry I can't give you guys more than that!\n\nMinus one star because I found there wasn't enough labeling happening. I saw things I was tempted to try but didn't because I wasn't sure of what they were. \"Is that caramel brown or PEANUT BUTTER brown?\" See the first world problems I face?
