Everybody loves brunch, even a gigantic looming robot (which is what Bassett's interesting mascot).\n\nMy girlfriend and I stopped in for lunch to find this joint PACKED with college students. The host told us that the wait would be about an hour. Luckily, we learned that anyone can skip the line by eating at the bar and found a couple seats at the end. I like to sit by my boo-thang, anyway...\n\nI love egg yolk on biscuits, so I could not order the Eggs Benedict? I love horchata, too, so I ordered their latte version.\n\nEverything was pretty solid, although, I think the dish could go without the hard bacon pieces sprinkled on top. I washed my EB down with a my sweet, cinnamon-y, and smooth horchata latte. I should've gotten two!\n\nGreat and friendly service! I would definitely consider returning if I was back on campus\/ my college dayz hood. Go Badgers!
