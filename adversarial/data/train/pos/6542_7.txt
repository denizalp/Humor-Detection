While perusing St. Lawrence Market like any Weekday tourist, one fact is undeniable.\nCarousel Bakery had more patrons hanging near them like Flies than most others.  \n\nCB provides a visual attraction as well as better-than-most self promotion....\n\"World Famous\"designation, Emeril Lagasse letter-of-gratitude, and Colors that remind you of ol' school McDonalds.\n\nWhile the price-point stays Tourist-reasonable for that Tourist MUST-TRY Canadian protein (Peameal Bacon), I was slightly surprised to see that the Breakfast on a Bun was prepped ahead of time as 10+ were packaged and waiting for the next purchasers.  In addition, I notice a Full Flat-top of Peameal sizzling away for their next round(?)\n\nBreakfast on a Bun($5.30)\n\n-  While ingredients are fresh(Peameal Bacon, Egg, Cheese, Country Bun).\n     I found the composition of the whole to be less than spectacular.  \n    This item doesn't provide the proper showcase of the ingredients to our Global Companions.\n\n------------\n\nFirst impact  -  Country Bun exterior envelopes all other ingredients.\n\nSecond impact  -  Melted Cheese slowly oozes out.\n\nLAST impact  -  Tender texture of nicely cooked Peameal Bacon.\n\n------------\n\nVerdict  -  Juiciness, flavour, and initial impact of the Peameal Bacon is sadly HIDDEN.
