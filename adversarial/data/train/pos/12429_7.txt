This place is a trip! I love the cooks and the owner! True east coaster. First off we get here during lunch rush hour and there is literally a line out the door. So in my freinds infinite wisdom he asked the Owner \"What's good here\" the owner responds \"Are you serious?! I don't have time for this and throws him a menu and says \"It's all good..when you're ready to order get back in line\" hahaha love it!\" I ordered two slice... should of got one, they are huge!! Just FYI order the double (two slices) it's cheaper than ordering two single slices. \n  While we were enjoying our meal, a guy comes in thinking he was all \"gangsta\" and tell the cook, \"Hey make me 3 of those!\" The cook who looked like Popeye! Just looks at him then points to the register and says \"Order there like everyone else!\" then Mr Gangster yells at the owner...\"Hey Bro!\".. without skipping a beat the owner yells back \"THAT'S CHEF BRO TO YOU!!\". You can't have old school pizza without the old school attitude! Definitely coming back again
