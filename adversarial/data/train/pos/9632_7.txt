New bars should be greeting customers with open arms, not ignoring them. So, I walked into here about 6pm on Thursday and I passed three dudes who were outside and then entered the bar which had a total of 5 customers drinking and no bartender in sight for a good 8 minutes. Turns out that the dude outside who was bullshitting with his buddies was the bartender and he also saw me walk in past his motley crue. If your the bartender and your outside and a customer walks inside, you would assume to go back in and get me a drink? Not this loser, but he finally appeared inside only too not get me a beverage again. Normally, I'm not shy and would yell out, but this place didn't deserve my money and it looked like they could have used it during this happy hour.
