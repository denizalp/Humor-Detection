I have to say that this place is the one I always look forward to eating at (other than Eggslut) whenever I'm in Vegas. All the other locations are in Manhattan so this is the closest to us. While I love my In-N-Out and Super Duper Burgers, this burger joint is definitely in my top 5 for fast food burger joints in the US. \n\nThis Shake Shack is located on Las Vegas Blvd. at The Park outdoor area. It says on Yelp it's at the New York New York Hotel, but it's actually outside and not connected to the hotel. There's also another one inside the T-Mobile Arena which is only accessible if it's open for events. \n\nThe reason I like this location more than the original one in Manhattan is that it's super spacious. (Maybe because the original is just a \"shack?\") You can bring your whole family plus extended family PLUS close friends. There's also extra tables outside. We usually go early when they just open so as to avoid the lunch rush. Even if you get there at that time, there will probably be a line at the door. But really, the wait is short. They expedite so well it's like a well-oiled machine! Another reason I love Shake Shack is that they have other tasty options;  like their Smoke Stack, Shroom Burger and Hot Dogs. They also have a more flavors of shakes than other places including new seasonal flavors each month. My favorite is their Chick'-N-Shack; their version of the Fried Chicken Sandwich.
