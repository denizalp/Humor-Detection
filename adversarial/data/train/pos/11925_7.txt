My husband had been begging me to go to this place to check out with him for months! So, after seeing pictures and reading a few reviews, I decided to go. Mind you, this was the first time for the both of us, and I was pretty excited to try something different in Vegas!\nAs we walked in, it was quite smaller than what I had imagined... Which, I loved! ( I felt like it was more intimate) after ordering, they brought out teas, which were out of this world! Then came the food. Tea sandwiches were good, and the different flavors definitely played with your taste buds in such a way, I can't even begin to explain. So... We moved on to the next plate, egh didn't care for the scones, a bit under cooked..jellies were good, though. Finally, the desserts! I was so incredibly excited , as they all looked delicious! Unfortunately, out of the 5, one was just \"okay\". Everything else was too bitter and has a funny taste as it touched your tongue.\nHere comes the bad part, as my husband and I were sitting there, all of a sudden I get a sudden urge to vomit, as does he. I barely make it to the bathroom, for 5 minutes I'm throwing every thing up. I come out, and then it's my husbands turn!\nCold sweat, bitter stomach, bad food. \nSuch a let down for such a beautiful place. \nFor the price (95, which tip is automatically included) totally not worth it.
