I stayed at this pig trot about 3 years ago with my then girlfriend (now wife). I found the hotel to be disgusting, dirty, roach infested and in a dangerous crime-ridden neighborhood.  There wasn't even a shower curtain!  But I'm writing now to point out what an awful staff they have.\n\nI had reserved the room for 2 people (me and my girlfriend). She flew in separately from me.  I got there first and was checking in.  The girl at the desk was an Eastern European. Trying to make small talk I asked her where she was originally from.  She hissed, \"I'm not going to tell you!\" I said, \"Sorry I was just making small talk, it's common in the US to do that.\"  She said, \"It is a strange question and I will not answer it.\" At this moment I noticed she actually had a tip jar on the counter.  Unreal.\n\nSo, anyway, she gave me a key and I said I needed two keys. She said, \"Why would your girlfriend not be with you?\" SO Of course I said, \"Sorry, but I'm not going to tell you!\" I smirked and took my 2 keys to the nasty room.\n\nLater when I checked out I asked the owner (an Indian or Pakistani) where the lady who checked me in was from....he told me BOSNIA!  So whoop dee doo I found out!! Haha...She's BOSNIAN!\n\nBOSNIA BOSNIA BOSNIA! Slobodan Milošević would be proud.
