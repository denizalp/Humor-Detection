Any restaurant where we're allowed to play flip cup with a group of 16 rowdy 20-somethings is somewhere I want to go.\n\nThe food sucks, but if you're looking to have a good time, Dick's might be for you.\n\nExamples of funny KKK-looking hats made by our server\n- I take more in the rear end than Fed-Ex\n- It's my birthday and all I got was an STD\n- So small I pee all over it\n\nJust a little sample of what you would be getting yourself in to at this place.
