I haven't had Japanese food this good since I was in San Francisco. Each aspect of this restaurant has been carefully thought out and crafted to perfection. From the relaxing, zen-like interior, to the fabulous food, you are guaranteed to have a great dining experience here.\n\nThe menu is prix-fixe, with options ranging from 3 course to 6 course. The 5 and 6 course meals have to be reserved 24 hours in advance, and the menu is strictly chef's choice (Aside from any dietary restrictions). We decided on the 4 course meal. For our four course meal, one of the courses had 2 different options to choose from, and we had the option of getting one of each and sharing it. Each course was exquisite, with a perfect blend of flavors. We started with a hirame dish, followed by a trio of marinated tuna, a perfect blue point oyster, and a lightly fried blue shrimp. We continued with a mixed mushroom and clam dish, a cook-your-own wagyu beef and vegetable dish, and ended the meal with a lovely nigiri sushi plate.\n\nDessert was complimentary and was a divine chawanmushi with fresh fruit.\n\nService was perfect. \n\nDefinitely a must-dine if you are in the Phoenix area!
