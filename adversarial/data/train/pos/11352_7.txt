i was skeptical at first to see All 5 Stars..it's True!\nI used Camelback Moving Co yesterday for my move from a home in Surprise Az to Phoenix, ( Ahwatukee.) This was the first time I have used this Company and I chose them based upon all the great reviews on Yelp. They are the real deal, great service, polite and professional crew and outstanding service, and at a very low price..When the foreman of the crew tallied up the time \/ hours and total bill (This move was for a 5 bedroom 2400 + sf House) I was shocked that it was so cheap, I almost thought he made a mistake, I asked him again what the total bill was and he repeated it, it was hundreds below my estimate for this size of a move, honesty I felt guilty that I paid so little, for the amount of work they did, and how much they moved. I had two living room sets, 5 full bedrooms, kitchen, large tables, outside patio table set, and many many heavy items. I thought the bill was going to be pretty hefty, however because they move very quick and efficient, without losing quality, their prices and service truly can't be beat! ... It's very true they will beat any moving company prices in town,,\n\n When my family moves again, I will not use any other company than Camelback Moving....They are who they say they are...\n\nVERY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!!
