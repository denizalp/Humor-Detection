My husband and I enjoy watching Cirque du Soleil shows, and this one did not disappoint. The beginning started off a bit slow for us--I do enjoy watching dance performances, but I was expecting much more acrobatics since this is a Cirque show.\n\nThe show started to pick up more because of the visuals. Overall, it was a great tribute to Michael Jackson, especially when the hologram of MJ appeared (my favorite part of the show).\n\nOne performer that I'm sure everyone noticed was the one-legged dancer. It's amazing how someone handicapped can overcome such a physical challenge and dance so well!\n\nWe didn't want to spend too much on tickets ($200 total), and sat in the back corner of the theater in Section 201, Row RR, Seats 3-4. Despite being that far back, the seats weren't bad at all.\n\nThe show lasted about an hour and a half, but it went by pretty quickly. If you're okay with watching dance performances and great visuals without much acrobatics, or if you're simply a Michael Jackson fan, then you would enjoy this show!
