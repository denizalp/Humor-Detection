This place is a horror story, unless you like horror stories I would recommend staying far, far away from this place.\n\nEveryone else's reviews are right, they can not get anything right! \n\nOrdered an appetizer which came out undercooked. \n\nOrdered two main dishes, one comes and the other did not...\n\nWait 20 minutes and the other one still hasn't arrived!\n\nPeople who ordered take out received their order before our second dish arrived... \n\nBest of all they want you to pay for food that hasn't come! \n\nThe place is just a mistake. Do yourself a favor, stay away.
