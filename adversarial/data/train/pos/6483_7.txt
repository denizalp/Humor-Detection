Looking for a Sandwich place that is different, cutting edge and makes your taste buds melt?  Well this is not your place!  I'm going to continue with my overtime take out review series with Sandwich Box.  You would think making a sandwich is probably not the most complicated task out there, but this place seems to get it all wrong.  \n\nMy order consisted of an egg salad sandwich on whole grain bread with a side salad.  When I received it, I only got the sandwich and the restaurant failed to tell me the salad was no longer included in the combo (yet the price remained the same).  That's great that the online menu was not updated to include items no longer available, a simple update would address all these problems knowmsayin?  Now on to the actual sandwich, the bread was thick.  I mean so thick it looked like there was about a half an inch of eggs inside of two encyclopedias worth of bread.  The eggs themselves, totally flavorless and bland.  Kinda hard to mess up an egg salad sandwich right?  Even Tim Horton's can get that right!\n\nTo make things short and sweet, I'll be looking over this option the next time I'm working late or considering a sandwich in the downtown area.
