The concept of this place is a novelty for Toronto so I was excited to try it out. \n\nWe went as a party of two and ordered a pound of mussels (lemon pepper, medium) and clams (Cajun, medium) with Cajun fries on the side, a half dozen raw oysters, and beers. \n\nService was serviceable and there was an adequate amount of paper towels (meaning an entire roll). The atmosphere was busy and the decor was fine. \n\nOn to the food...unfortunately. To put it bluntly, the mussels tasted like those white rubber erasers dropped into a vat of spicy chicken seasoning and boiled for an hour. The seasonings and grease overwhelmed any hint of shellfish flavor that might have remained after cooking.\n\nThe best part of our meal was the oysters (fresh with decent condiments) and the beers (cold) because neither of which was boiled, to our relief. \n\nMaybe it's growing pains or the fear of sending out  a bad clam but I would give this place another chance when crawfish are in season. Until then, Yelp is telling me this review looks pretty epic so I'll end it here.
