John M nailed it. Full Circle Pizza and Oyster Bar is fantastic. Look, I'll be honest. If you like generic pizza and are happy with Papa John's or Domino's, don't come here. The quality is amazing, the prices are reasonable for the quality of the ingredients and technique, and the food is unique. \n\nI was expecting the usual combos from the likes of Without Papers, UNA, Double Zero, etc. Nope. The ingredients and toppings are different and it works. I ate the most delicious octopus pizza. If you don't like takoyaki or okonomaki squid, skip this dish. The octopus was PERFECTLY cooked. The sweet corn cut into the salty, smoky flavours of the bonito flakes and seaweed. \n\nI can go on and on about the delicious wine, appetizer (try the fried mozzarella), and lovely charred but not too charred crust... but it would be much more pleasurable for you to go try their food!\n\nI predict Full Circle will be Fully Busy in 2016. Prices are MORE than reasonable for the quality. I love value and I found it here.
