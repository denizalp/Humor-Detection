I fly quite regularly down to Phoenix (used to go direct to Tucson, but express jet went bankrupt) and I am stuck with US Airways as being the only non-stop from Spokane. With that being said I have never had an issue with them. But this last time really fried me and my traveling companion.\n\nWe showed up at the Phoenix Airport check-in counter 1 hour and 16 minutes before our flight was to leave. We had tried to E-check-in the night before but the system could not find our return reservation. \n\nFor over 45, yes FOURTY-FIVE minutes we worked with a representative and then their supervisor do find our reservation. We had the original receipt with the confirmation code but they could not find either one of our tickets.\n\nLow and behold at exactly 29 minutes before the flight was to leave the supervisor looked up and said \"well here is your reservation, but I can't issue you a ticket!\" \n\n\"Why not\"\n\n\"Because you got here too late, you must check in at least 30 minutes before your flight leaves and YOU (she did stress YOU) didn't do that.\"\n\nI am not kidding you. It took us another 10 minutes before she would issue us a boarding pass for the 830 PM flight (NOTE: It's 10 AM now a full 12 hours to wait). We made a mad dash for the plane zoomed through the security and showed up at our original flight, only to be told that the flight was closed and there was nothing they could do. So we waited and watched the plane sit at the gate for 23 minutes before it finally pushed back.\n\nWe went to customer service and were told again: \"It is our fault for not arriving early enough.\" And \"You should expect computer glitches and get here earlier, it's not US Airways fault.\"\n\nThey had the audacity to tell us that we should arrive at least 4, yes FOUR hours before a domestic flight with carry-on baggage only. Imagine if we were traveling international with checked baggage, should we be at the airport 24 hours in advance????\n\nUS Airways gave us no meal vouchers for their screw-up and while we waited and waited we watched two different times that the doors were re-opened on a closed flight for passengers that got there late.\n\nThey had no apologies, except to blame us for their computer error; they did nothing to help us out, meal vouchers, etc. They ignored our request for seats near the front of the plane; I was in the 2nd to the last row (22), while stand-by passengers for this flight received rows 7, 8 and 11. \n\nIt will be a cold day in hell before I fly on this airline again, I will change planes, I will wait extra, I will do what it takes, but never again will I be told that THEIR computer problems are MY fault.
