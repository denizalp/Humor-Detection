I've shopped at WinCo in California before, and always liked their bulk foods section. I was again very impressed with this new store that opened in Gilbert near SanTan Village for the ever-expanding buying-in-bulk options. I mean, you can buy Pork Rinds in bulk here! That's ridiculous... ridiculously awesome!  (Although it might be an indicator of future cardiac health issues if you really need to sustain a Pork Rind habit that involves buying them by the pound!)\n\nThe other bulk foods available at WinCo includes a dedicated station for walnuts and pecans, honey and nut butters, an impressive array of whole bean coffees, and bulk spices (even taco seasoning... amazing!). I was also pleased to note that their prices are very competitive when it comes to lunch meat and other items that I hate to get nickel-and-dimed to death on. Wasn't entirely smitten with their choices of beefsteak however. I can find better prices on New York Strip steaks (Costco, for instance), but their ribeyes were decent and only around $6\/lb.\n\nI would advocate checking out WinCo if you're a savvy, price comparison shopper. You're likely to find that they underprice the competition on a lot of grocery items, however, their selection may be lacking in some departments.  Nonetheless, it's a great big huge store that is fun to explore, even if it's on a fact-finding mission to see how many peach gummy rings you would need to buy to fill an entire bathtub.
