Could not be more glad that I couldn't hold my bladder any longer and needed to take a pee break in the Pacific Mall basement because I would not have otherwise stumbled on this little gem of a Japanese dollar store (actually $2 store). I love Daiso and this is like Daiso but even better because the US dollar is strong and works out being cheaper than $1.50 per item (as priced in Daiso). Furthermore, I found more nifty and useful household items here than I did at Daiso. Thusly, Ichiban Living = win. \n\nI also like that a majority of the products are made in Japan and are super cute and seem pretty durable...unlike some comparable made in China goods. No offense, motherland. Gotta tell it like it is. \n\nWill be back over and over and over until the US dollar drops in value again...but possibly even then, I will be back.
