I love Smokey Joe's. It's a bit like taking a time machine back to the eighties, but that's okay because I loved the eighties. The dance floor is high-school-dance retro, and the same people are on the floor every week, and they still can't dance. The downstairs bar reeks of stale beer, but the beer towers and shooter girls make up for that. The staff is great. The rooftop patio is the best in North York and one of the best in the city--only patios at streetlevel are better. Smokey Joe's won't win any awards for decor or its food, but it does what it does very well.\n\nOh--Smokey Joe's Cafe comes up on Yelp under cafes when it is decidedly a bar.\n\nUPDATE\n\n\nSmokey Joes has undergone a reno, a really well done reno. The bar used to have a faint beer smell to it (well, more than faint) and now that's gone. I now looks really classy. I'm not a fan of the vertical wooden bars that separate the dining area from the bar area--it makes the bar feel a little claustrophobic--and part of the bar was built such that you can't fit your knees under it and you have to sit a foot away from your drink. Leif, the owner, is a pleasant guy who makes conversation and has been known to treat his customers just right (that is, he'll occasionally buy a customer a drink, or make them some kind of concoction behind the bar). I really like this place. Smokey Joes gets bonus points for being stumbling distance from my home.
