Worst restaurant experience I've ever had in my life, let alone sushi. I was extremely disappointed and will never be returning. \nLet me start by saying that Rock N Roll Sushi has been on my list of go to sushi restaurants for a while now and I finally visited. What attracted me were decent reviews, alcoholic beverages, and a professional website.\nYesterday at roughly 4pm I called and asked if there was currently a wait and if the AYCE included EVERYTHING on the menu. I was told by a female that there was no wait and EVERYTHING on the menu was included in AYCE. \nWe arrived at about 5pm and the place was completely empty (told the truth about no wait). We are asked how many and we state 4. Immediately told there will be a 15% gratuity included on bills of 4 or less because they're \"on the strip\". Hardly on the strip and have ate at finer restaurants in casinos with no such BS rule, but I'm hungry so it's a go. \nOnce seated we're asked if we're doing AYCE or A La Carte. I state the 3 adults will do AYCE and my 4 year old daughter will do A La Carte. I was told the whole table needs to do AYCE or A La Carte, no exceptions. So I need to pay $28 for a 4 year old to eat some chicken and rice? I dispute it with the server because she's 4 years old and she gives me an attitude and says \"whatever\".\nWhile the server is getting our drinks I'm looking at the AYCE rules and it clearly states SASHIMI IS NOT INCLUDED. Upon her return I asked her if that was true and she said yes. I asked her why not even an hour ago she LIED to me on the phone and said EVERYTHING was included. She denied ever having the conversation with me and played dumb. \nShe was extremely disrespectful and didn't care if we left or not. We left without saying another word. I will never return and I hope others don't waste their time. \nWe ended up going to Doh Sushi on Spring Mountain. Go there! Absolutely delicious, great service, same price, nice atmosphere.
