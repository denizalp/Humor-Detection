Get here while you can(not). Soju won't last 6 months.  I had the Bulgogi and my girlfriend had the Salmon.  Neither had any taste and mine was under cooked. \n\nThe chef came to the table and didn't even introduce himself.  It was odd and uncomfortable.  \n\nThis is a typical Pittsburgh restaurant; wrong music, waitstaff wearing sports shirts and the food is below average.  \n\nSoju wouldn't last 1 week in a big city.
