Clean, fast & friendly - that is this Jersey Mike's. Will the sandwiches ruin you for all other sandwiches in your life? No. But when your tummy's a rumblin' and you need a quick sammie in the University area, this location will suit just fine. \n\nThe folks behind the counter crafting your sandwich and taking your payment are quite friendly. They also seem to really pay attention to regulars, and I really appreciate that. Yay for kind customer service. \n\nAs for my turkey sub, it was fresh and as a regular size, pretty substantial. Get it, sub-stantial?! Hardy har har. The booths and tables are super clean as were the restrooms. All in all, Jersey Mike's has got it going on...oh, and they have Garden Salsa Sun Chips. That's my bag of chips, y'all.
