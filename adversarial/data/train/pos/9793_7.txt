Engaged?  Check out Tiffany & Co. located on the 2nd floor inside the Fashion Show Mall. This store just opened September 2011.  \n\nI love coming to this convenient location to get the bling cleaned and always get wonderful friendly service even from the security guard, John-but he just recently went to Crystals (mall next to Aria)...let's just say the service at the Crystal's Tiffany & Co. from one dumb blonde \"service\" person was unprofessional so if you are at Tiffany & Co. and you see the dumb blonde...run! Other salespeople there were great.\n\nThis store gets very busy but they go out of their way to make sure everyone is taken care of.  I brought my ring here to get re-sized and I got a follow-up call with the status and in just a few weeks I got my newly sized ring back. Check them out!
