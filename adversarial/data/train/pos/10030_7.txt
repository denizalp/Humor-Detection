See food... Usually I see food and then I eat it! But this time I'm talking about seafood. To be fair you're going to need to read my review all the way through to understand why I'm giving them 3 stars. \n\nI am a breakfast fanatic and wanted to come for breakfast, unfortunately they only had breakfast brunch until 3 o'clock. (This is the average time in vegas that buffets serve breakfast). When in Vegas it's sometimes hard to get anywhere by then. I rushed my friends out of the room and we  to got to Caesars at 1:45 PM. Unfortunately I didn't realize that the wait could be hours long, I should've read the other reviews. They wouldn't be able to seat us till after 3 which means I was not going to get my breakfast buffet. Prices also go up after 3. \n\nWe ended up getting seated at 3:15 which means the buffet has turned into dinner now. Even though the food was good and had a lot of seafood, my preference buffets with more choices. My friends who enjoy seafood loved this buffet so if you enjoy crab legs, crawfish, and other seafood you will probably enjoy this buffet. I ended up eating pizza, some Chinese food, and a few of their desserts but nothing really blew me away. They had someone preparing crepes and tacos, which was nice. The food is good but I prefer more selection at my buffets especially because I'm a picky eater who doesn't eat pork, red meat, or seafood. I would be willing to come back and try their breakfast brunch. \n\nLastly this buffet is not cheap, be ready to roll out the dough. I paid about $60 and my friends added unlimited mimosas for about $70! At least they were drunk enough to forget how much they spent.
