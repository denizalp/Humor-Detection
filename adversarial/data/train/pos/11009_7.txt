9\/27\/17 UPDATE: *Comment left by owner on bottom is misleading and incorrect.  DO NOT book your Greece trip with them.* \n\n\n\n9\/25\/17: The price they charged us was definitely not discounted.  They OVERCHARGED us over $1000 more per person.  It would have been cheaper if we booked the trip ourselves.\n\nThey booked our group in separate flights and lied that the flights were sold out.  I looked up the flights and it was not sold out.\n\nTHEY BOOKED US IN MOLDY ROOMS WITH BAD REVIEWS.  We requested to change the hotels and they said they would.  They never changed the hotels.  \n\nThe hotels had stains on my bedsheets and bath towels.  There were nasty gunk on the sinks.  Blood stains on the walls. The place stank of severe mold issue.  I got sick inhaling all the nasty mold in our hotel rooms.  The water smelled like sewer water. \n\nWe requested 2 beds.  They booked us 1 bed instead of 2 beds.  We repeatedly for 2 months asked for our ferry and shuttle times.  They did not give us the itinerary until we were at our hotels and we had to change our trip plans.\n\nSave yourself the headache and save tons of money by booking your own hotel, flight, and have hotel call the cab for you.
