What a welcome arrival Corner 11 is in Tremont! This place opened somewhat suddenly in a vacant space that was most recently home to the short-lived Merchant Street Provisions quick-stop market (the Merchant Street restaurant still thrives next door). There aren't currently many lunch options in Tremont, which is in part, I suspect, because there aren't a lot of businesspeople working here during the daytime - but which I hope doesn't mean there's no room for one, because this place is GOOD, & I'd like to see it succeed.\n\nOn my first visit, just a day after their soft opening, I ordered a small poke bowl (they have three sizes), which comes with one protein. With (requested) input from an employee, I chose shrimp on a bed of greens (white & midnight rice are also available), topped with mango, cucumber, carrots, & avocado. From their sauce bar (about 10 sauce options, a few homemade), I chose a tangy tom yum sauce, then topped my bowl with their freebies, sesame seeds & crispy wonton strips. Yes, this is an Asian Chipotle-style set-up - but it's a million times more delicious, & it tastes so fresh. I scarfed down my salad, but not before I sent a photo of it to at least four people to tell them they need to try Corner 11.\n\nFor $5, I also ordered three steam buns with red bean filling (custard & black sesame also available, & you can mix them up). They surprised me by showing up in the shape of little hedgehogs - so cute! The guy working the front, named Sam, also brought me a small sample cup of their signature curry soup, which I'm going to have to order a bowl of. It was incredibly flavorful.\n\nCorner 11 also offers a variety of beverages, including Thai tea, which I'll try next time. This time, I just got water, orange-infused, which is complimentary. A nice touch. \n\nNeedless to say, as long as Corner 11 exists & I live in Tremont, it'll be my daytime lunch go-to. I can't recommend it highly enough, even after only one visit!
