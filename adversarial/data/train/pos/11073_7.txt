Their pulled pork is roasted for 18 hours, y'all. It's absolutely delicious, like literal melt-in-your-mouth tender and packed with serious flavor. \n\nEverything on Pave's menu sounds fantastic, but I had to narrow it down and choose something during our lunch excursion. I happily ended up with the Osaka sandwich: the perfect pulled pork, crisp english cucumber, tangy goat cheese, and a kamikaze sauce with candied ginger that tied the whole thing together with a mild spicy kick. The only part of the sandwich that wasn't fabulous was the gluten free bread, but I was extremely grateful they even had the option available. I think I'd rather just have the contents of the sandwich on their own (or on lettuce), however, since I found the GF bread to be especially dry and bland.\n\nPave has a ton of creative sandwiches that feature steak, pork, chicken, or bacon - plus an array of vegetarian selections. They also have breakfast, pizza, and desserts. The menu seemed a little bit all over the place, but Adam and I were satisfied with our orders. The kettle cooked potato chips made a great side and added some texture to my meal, and I think the portions were perfect for lunch. \n\nMy one regret? Not ordering the gluten free mango cheesecake. What is wrong with me!? Where will I find that again? I'm mildly upset about it you guys. \n\nOtherwise, all positive thoughts when it comes to Cafe Pave!
