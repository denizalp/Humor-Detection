I love neighborhood areas with a story. This space has an interesting story to tell so read the information that is posted and then enjoy the cooling spray of the falls. I am sure that sometimes this area is jam packed with families. \nEnjoy this little park. You can't miss it as it is right on Indian School Road.\nBring your dog or your whole family here for some outdoor fun and splash around.
