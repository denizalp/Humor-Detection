Stayed here for 5 nights & you get what you pay for. Both rooms we rented for EDC smelled like cigarettes even though they're apparently not smoking rooms. The smell stayed all 5 days. Air conditioning is really cold (which I like). \n\nLoved the customer service in the casino area and the fast food places weren't that bad. Buffet upstairs was pretty good and Bucca di beppo was on parr. \n\nThe really bad downside is we found a cockroach in our bathroom and I was so traumatized. I'm sure there's more than where one came from
