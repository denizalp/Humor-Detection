For someone who has been to Vegas many times and stayed at motels and hotels countless numbers of times, this was one of the worst. Something you wouldn't expect from a themed hotel on the strip, right?\n\nPros: \n - I liked that the window of the room opened a tiny bit. Barely opened, but most rooms are completely sealed.\n- View was pretty nice even if most of it was the parking lot. Nice sunset, mountains, and people-watching.\n- TV was decent sized widescreen (but had a terrible picture)\n\nCons: \n- Hardly a trace of the \"Excalibur\" atmosphere anymore\n- One bedspread smelled like a man's body odor, very gross. Hotel never ended up replacing it, we tried telling housekeeping but she did not understand and did not speak very good English.\n- The \"ice bucket\" looked like it was used to make another kind of \"ice\". It was burned very bad on the bottom, very weird and gross.\n- There was dried urine on the TOP of the toilet lid, again - very strange. What happened in this room?\n- Shower only, no bathtub. Most places like this have a shower-bath. Was kind of a bummer. Got up on the counter after walking miles and soaked my feet in the sink instead.\n\nThe worst part? Below.\n\nHousekeeping entered our room without permission, while we were inside, TWICE. I found this to be very rude, as both times we had the \"Do Not Disturb\" sign on the door, and both times were way before our checkout time!! Our side of the door only locked from the outside after it was closed, so both times they knocked, and then after NOT being told to enter, because we were sitting around in our pajamas in the morning, watching TV, and in the bathroom busy getting dressed, they BARGE in and the second time I am in the bathroom, doing my hair and this dude barges in, rudely asks if we are checking out soon, I said yes? and he finally left. What the fuck? This has never happened to me at any hotel or motel, ever!\n\nIf you're in Vegas, don't stay here. Stay anywhere but here.\n\nThe only reason I didn't formally complain to Excalibur (other than Twitter, which they ignored) was because the room was in my friend's name and paid for by him, not me.
