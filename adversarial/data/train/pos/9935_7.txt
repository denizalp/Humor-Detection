I really like Papago for the variety - 30 beers on tap and God knows how many in the refrigerator cases. All can be consumed on-site or brought home to stock your personal inventory. \n\nWhat I especially dig is how knowledgeable the staff are about the beer -- even the ones who barely look old enough to drink! I've learned a lot already, from the different types of beer glasses to how some beers are aged and discovering what I like! \n\nYou can play darts or any of the many board games they've got out. We played Yahtzee on one recent visit. There's a jukebox and a TV for further distraction. \n\nThe food is OK. Nothing spectacular. Ball park pretzels, thin pizza crust with sauces for dipping, quesadillas, pizzas, etc. There are severely limited options for non-beer drinkers (like 4-5 mediocre wines to chose from and canned\/bottled sodas). \n\nThat said, if you're willing to explore the world of beer - this HAS to be your first stop!
