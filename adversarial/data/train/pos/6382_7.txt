Aye Caramba indeed! If you want a thick ass tamale that tastes like God blesses it with salsa verde and corn, then this is the place to freaking get it on \n\nMy ass crack fianc√© was smitten, SMITTEN by the tamale quality and the quest dip. Make sure you order that damn quest it is well worth the arbitrary 2.50. Hell, I'd pay 6.50 for that liquid crack. \n\nAnyway, these fine folks know what the fuck they are doing and the beans we do good and I don't even like beans! Very tasty with those damn addicting chips.\n\nHappy eating all!
