This is the second time I have entered Mother Nature's Farm. Last year, took my 3 year old and 8 month old girls, this year we are all a year older. To start, my girls have no interest at 18 months in bouncy houses, stickers, hay bale mazes, or hay rides. We were there to accommodate the big brother. Despite that, the entry fee is $10 (YES! TEN DOLLARS) per kid over 1. Really??? So, the fact that we had a deal with a friend who had a field trip rate of $5 per kid and $3 for parents is the ONLY reason we continued in. Went to check out the animals where some of my friends were which was convenient because it was right next to the porta johns and unfortunately, nature was calling me to use one. Oh. My. God. DISGUSTING. I have never seen anything more revolting than what was inside there. The sign on the door that showed the inspection showed that no one had been there since 10\/8. Today is the 11th. Unexceptable.\nSo, the good part is, my son got his hayride (the girls cried the whole time and I struggled to hold them as we sat), he had fun with friends in the bouncy house, stuck some stickers on a tiny pumpkin, and zipped through the hay maze a few times. So, for him, $5 well spent. I think $10 would have been pretty steep. \nSo, if you're going to the pumpkin patch, stop somewhere close and pee before you get there, make sure you are there with a field trip, and leave your kids under 3 with someone else. They will get nothing out of it except a walk through grass (or a stroller ride in our case). This will be our last visit.
