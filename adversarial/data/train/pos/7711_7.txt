BEWARE IF THERE IS DAMAGED DONE TO YOUR VEHICLE BY ONE OF WAL-MART CARTS THEY WON'T TAKE RESPONSIBILITY !!!! I went inside to shop to come to a cart still stuck to my car.had DAMAGED to my front bumper so I went inside to speak to manager. She took pictures, I took pictures they had video recording of incident. But yet a multi billion dollar company CAN'T\/NOR take responsibility. They gave me run around for 2 weeks.just to spend me a letter in mail.even with proof that it was THERE fault.and can't hire efficient employees to collect carts! BE CAREFUL WHERE you SPEND YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY.JUST TO COME OUT TO Your CAR DAMAGED! I understand Wal-Mart is a one stop shop.I refuse to shop there.and maybe you should too.I WILL gladly pay a little more gas and money on things I need for my home! Rather then give Wal-Mart company my money! Hopefully word of mouth is everything in this case.thank u for reading
