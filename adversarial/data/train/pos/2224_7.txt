We recently purchased a home from John and it was a delightful experience.  John and his team are always polite, courteous, accommodating and willing to help in any way.  We ran into some snags with the home we bought after the purchase was complete.  Unbeknown to all of us they left an attic full of junk. John stepped right in and came to the rescue, getting the seller to cover all costs of removal.  It's now been a month and a half since our purchase was complete and John is still following up.  We are in the middle of an extensive remodel and he even sent a little pick-me-up to lift our spirits.  Made our day and was above and beyond. We will definitely recommend John and give him our highest endorsement.
