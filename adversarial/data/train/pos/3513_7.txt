I was stuck in traffic on the strip - no surprise!  But, I was SO hungry after my flight that when I saw the word 'Bahay', I became so excited and did a jacked up turn to make it into the parking lot.  \n\nStepping inside was like heaven.  Especially to a person delusional from hunger.  They have all the Filipino food you could imagine...honestly, it was that big of a selection.  \n\nAfter much debate, I decided on the kare-kare (ox-tail in peanut butter) and sinagang (tamarind broth soup).  With a heaping pile of steamed rice.  Under $10.  Deal alert!  \n\nThe kare-kare was realllllly good.  (ALMOST as good as my mom's.)  You know how some places skimp out on the peanut butter?  Nope, not this place!  Peanut buttery goodness.  \n\nSinagang, yum.  It had so many veggies and such a nice broth that it balanced the heaviness of the kare-kare.  I think I sat in the booth for a good 10 min after I was done eating. Food coma at its finest.
