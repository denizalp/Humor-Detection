I came here because I recalled a review comparing it to Haji Baba in Tempe. I LOVE me some Haji Baba so I really hoped this place lived up to my lofty expectations as I live right down the street.  The only thing I'd say it really has in common is they both give you huge portions of gyro meat (btw, what do you call gyro meat if you don't put it on a gyro? Is it still called gyro meat? Or is there some existential crisis that would occur if you did not stuff it in a pita and cover it with tzaziki sauce? Ponder that for a minute.) with your order. As far as everything else, Chicago Gyros comes up a little short.\n\nTo start with, WHY oh WHY is it so hard for casual restaurants to learn how to properly operate a fountain drink machine. Can McDonalds please start offering some Lunch and Learns to these folks so that everyone can learn the optimum carbonation that turns Dr Pepper from prune flavored caramel syrup to the delightful nectar of the gods that it is? Because McDonalds gets it right EVERY time. Chicago Gyros, sadly, didn't.\n\nLike I said before, the Gyro had a generous portion of \"gyro meat\", and the meat was pretty tasty, but it was lacking in the accoutrement that I prefer. Mainly, cheese. There wasn't any feta on my gyro! Is that not standard? If it's not it should be. I had to steal some from my salad, and salads can't really afford to get things stolen from them. They know they're on thin ice, taste-wise, as it is. \n\nIt wasn't bad, and for $8 I won't complain too much, but It will probably be my second or third choice for Gyro's around.  Though I'll probably be back to check out the \"Chicago\" portion of their menu (hot dogs and shiz). I'll probably be hungover so hopefully they have their fountain machine fixed.
