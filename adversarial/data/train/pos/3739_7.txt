E-Jo can mean many things in Korean...Yi dynasty. Back in Joseon (Yi) dynasty, the main dishes served were side dishes, rice, and soup.  E-Jo is known for their soup, so order their sullungtang, gomtang, dogani tang, haejang guk. \n\nhaejang guk - best for you party animals who have a hangover. \n\ndogani tang is my favorite.. so order this.\n\nbtw.. you're stupid if you order anything other than their soup.\n\nE-Jo also means \"forget\". So after you have your hangover soup, forget about all the bad decisions you made the night before. :)
