Ate here with my hubby couple months ago. Superb food. Very clean reataurant...Atmosphere was on point abd though menu was surprisingly small, the quality was there. Had an excellent time. My husband even got a surprise message from the GM because we were happy with the restaurant and staff and service...he was comped a nice gift card! Thanks public school we will be dining in pretty soon! I do recommend bison burgers snd some of their local brews!
