Literally, the best little burger stop you can find other than in n out. High quality burgers. Thick shakes. Crispy fries. It doesn't get any better. Oh wait, it does. Because the service might actually be one of the best for a fast food place. They're always welcoming when you first walk in and helpful from the minute you order til when you leave. They check up on you during your meal and even get you to go boxes and bags. I like the fact that they have a condiment bar with different toppings for your meal. And they really do become a dang habit. A delicious habit.
