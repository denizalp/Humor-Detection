I reserved a rental car for my father that said it would only be $105. When he dropped off the car it was $240.00. They claimed he got the 26.00 a day insurance for a 21.00 a day rental car. Yeah right. When I was waiting for the manger who they said would not speak to me because I was not driver. They then threatened to call security on me because I was telling another person what happened to us. some lady at the front desk told me to shut up and they were not gonna help us.\nI know for a fact they took advantage of my father because English is not his first language. Advantage stands for takes advantage.
