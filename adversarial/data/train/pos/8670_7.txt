Quite possibly the best pizza I've ever had!! I ordered takeout for me and my team while working late one evening. Sadly, my work was 1 mile outside of their delivery radius, so I had to go pick it up. I even offered to pay extra to get them to bring it to my building, but no luck! It made me sad to pick it up because after I saw how busy the bar and the restaurant were (Friday night), I really wanted to eat in!! Talk about FOMO. \n\nWe ordered a large pepperoni and sausage pizza, thin crust. Lou Malnati's is known for their high-quality ingredients and I can tell you that the sausage was very fresh and worth every penny. The slices were cut skinny enough that I didn't feel guilty about eating 4 of them. My coworkers got buffalo wings on the side. The wings came with bleu cheese dressing and they said the dressing was SO GOOD! They wouldn't shut up about that dressing for the rest of our shift at work.\n\nDon't miss Lou Malnati's for their deep dish pizza (great in the restaurant, but not so great as take-out). But, definitely order thin crust if ordering to go. Enjoy the pie!
