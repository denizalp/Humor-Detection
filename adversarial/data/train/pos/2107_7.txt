I had a pinhole in one of my tires causing a tiny leak and every three or four months my tire pressure light would come on. Eventually I got fed up with having to deal the issue and figured it was about time to get it fixed.\n\nBig O Tires patched up my tire for FREE ($0.00)! I don't know anywhere else that offers this service for absolutely no charge. I just drove in, explained my problem to one of the servicemen, filled out a little bit of paperwork, and left my keys with them. A couple hours later I get a call saying my car's ready to be picked up and that was it!\n\nTHANK YOU to the awesome Big O team here for a simple, friendly, no fuss experience. You guys rock!
