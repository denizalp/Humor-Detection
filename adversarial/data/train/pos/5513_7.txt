Los Dos Molinos has good food.\n\nI recommend the Mexican Pizza -- with the option to add ground beef. The shredded beef tacos are good, as well. Other than that, expect what is typical from a Mexican restaurant.\n\nYes, the food does have a small amount of spice, but I don't see what the big hype is (very mild to me). Also, the staff is generally very attentive.\n\nAnd on the weekends, expect a large crowd.\n\nPrices are reasonable. For example, a Deluxe Mexican Pizza is about $9. Tacos are about $4 each.
