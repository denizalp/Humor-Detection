My love for Andreoli Italian Grocer knows no limits! I have been coming here long before their infamous debut on diners drive in's and dives, I also reluctantly admit that I was apprehensive to yelp about this place because I was scared that once the secret got out so would my dear beloved Andreoli's. \n\nThankfully, even with the major notoriety this place has received over the last year or so, not a thing has changed about this place other than the size of the restaurant and the Guy Fieri poster plastered on the door as you walk in. \n\nThe Patriarch aka Chef Giovanni still consistently serves up some of the best Italian food in town. A must if your on this side of town!
