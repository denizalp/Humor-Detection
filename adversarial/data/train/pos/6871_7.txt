For a quick burger. For downtown.  It's not bad.  Yet, we all have experienced better.\n\nThat's about where the thrills for this place end.  I ordered a $9 cheeseburger and was delivered a dish that at first glance looked like the size of a slider.  Very small.  The burgers taste decent, but the portions are very small.  Avoid the \"Lola Ketchup,\" as it's absolutely the most hideous burger condiment I've ever tasted.\n\nI keep forgetting that this place has some crazy obsession with rosemary fries, and you have to ask for normal french fries.\n\nBurgers take about 10-minutes, their $3 soft drink cups hold a measly 12oz and they use a system of SHOUTING out your name to pick up the order.  So if you have a generic, boring, single syllable name like \"Bob,\" suggest you come up with something more creative when there's a crowd.\n\nCrowd's aren't bad on weekdays, but on weekends I've seen a wait, and a severe drought of table availability.
