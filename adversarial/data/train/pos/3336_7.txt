After eating at the lounge, it's one of the best snack places in montreal. The bubble tea is good but the thing to come here for is their salt and pepper fried chicken... delicious! The price is very good too, fitting for this economy. The environment is relaxing, a nice place to bring friends and chat. Will definitely return. Remember to bring cash only.
