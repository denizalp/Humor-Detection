Impressed by Shawn McClain since his Green Zebra days back in Chicago, a meal at Sage shortly after it opened confirming that his elegant simplicity could indeed translate to the Las Vegas market\n(though Five-50 Pizza later proved to be a half-baked Money Grab,) rumors of Libertine Social at Mandalay Bay being the first Casino restaurant in ages to challenge Gastro-Pub conformity by way of ingredients and technique finally lured me in almost exactly six months after it's opening August 8th\n2016 opening.\n\nNot immune to the advertising or PR push, an invite to the grand-opening by Kerry Clasby politely declined as 2016 was dedicated to supporting more longstanding restaurants both on the Strip and in the community, it was as a party of two that dinner on Friday was enjoyed amidst spacious confines where guests are invited to sit at the bar, lounge or dining room in back, a plethora of decorations ranging from street signs to old-LPs decorating the walls as music plays forgivingly lightly.\n\nCertainly a spectacle, the outdoor patio and well-stocked bar both showcasing design as low lighting generates an intimate feel despite the restaurant's size, the menu and kitchen at Libertine Social are the responsibility of Executive Chef Jamaal Taherzadeh, his modern American cuisine ranging from fun to seriously technique-oriented while vegetables from the Intuitive Forager Farmers Markets stand unparalleled on their own, or when used to enhance the flavor of everything from Pastas and Flatbreads to roasted Meats.\n\nWell celebrated for Cocktails crafted by Tony Abou-Ganim, the classics perhaps a bit pricey given their nearby ubiquity while the Fizzes, Draught, Barrel-Aged and Bottled lists all show a lot of thought, those fond of Gin are encouraged to take a look at the refreshing Apple Cobbler with a clean Cucumber finish while Vodka fans will undoubtedly be delighted by a frothy Milano that is Spirit-forward and bright with a whole lot of Citrus.\n\nPartially deferring to Chef Taherzadeh and adding a few intriguing items along the way, guests enjoying a drink would be foolish to ignore the Scotch Olives pitted and packed with Cheese beneath a lightly fried Lamb Sausage Crust, the laser-cut Modern Fried Egg a vessel seen several times in the past but here better than most with creamy Corn Pudding blanketed in Egg Custard beneath a dollop of Caviar.\n\nTaking the extra steps to pour a chilled Watercress Soup tableside over King Crab Salad before having some fun with airy, flavor-packed Churros that will make fans of Cheetos question why they've been fooled into thinking the snack was as good as it gets for so long, a different sort of upgrade is delivered by 'Shrimp n' Grits' that improves on both with snappy Prawns and creamy Polenta plus the savory heat of Chorizo.\n\nTurning attention to some Boards, Spreads and Dips, the Pretzels puffy and piping hot alongside house Mustard and melted Raclette, more Crab comes by way of the creamed Spinach Dip studded with big chunks of the good stuff flown in daily from Alaska while the Duck Liver Mousse at first appears to be far too much for even a party of four until the air is stirred out of it and the bright Fig-Balsamic Glaze on top turns it into the city's most luxurious PB&J-reminiscent topping for Grilled Bread.\n\nPlacing two handmade Pastas on the menu, one old and the other new, Jamaal admits that the tender Lamb Neck served over Cavatelli is his dish most often taken home for dinner, the salting intense even when accounting for the mellowing effect of Ricotta while the Sweet Potato Agnolotti rival any Italian restaurant in town by placing the typical Sage and Brown Butter in a different context with softened Pears and toasty brown Pesto.\n\nMistakenly guessing the sweet and savory duet of Honey-drizzled Fennel and Sausage Flatbread plus Barbecued Carrots atop earthy Kohlrabi Puree as the final round before dessert, and thus overindulging in both as they each exemplify the pure, honest flavors familiar to followers of Chef McClain, it was with wide eyes that the kitchen presented two more entr√©e-sized plates including Sea Bass quite similar to that at Aureole next door (minus the head) plus a daily special of Medium-Rare Wagyu brightened by acid with a bit of heat and Black Truffles plus an outstanding side of \"Local Fare\" featuring wrinkly Fingerling happily soaking up the flavors of two types of Pork carried by a soft-poached Egg. \n\nTaking a Double Espresso over Ice next, the choice of Cubes vs. Pellets a nice touch, dessert was presented with two menu-favorites plus the all-new Black and Tan Pudding, a refreshing savory note imparted by the Cream in a tall glass while neither the Pie nor Bread Pudding were overly sweet, instead focusing on letting the ingredients shine on their own with the Maraschino Cherry Ice Cream playing particularly well off the Whiskey in replicating the classic flavors of a Manhattan Cocktail.
