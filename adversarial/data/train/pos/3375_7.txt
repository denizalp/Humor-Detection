I was initially going to give Riva's 3-stars, as they're really just like any other Filiberto's\/Umberto's\/Roberto's\/Ernie and Berto's out there, except for a couple of small differences.\n\nFor one, everything seems to be just a little bit more fresh there.  It's probably not, but it tastes like it.  And secondly, their little salsa bar is killer because their green salsa has plenty of flavor and they always have fresh pico de gallo out there, a must for any burrito.\n\nThe California Burrito, with carne asada, potatoes, pico de gallo and cheese, is a must, as is the standard Carne Asada Burrito.  But the real winner here is the Carne Asada Fries.  A metric ton of carne asada piled on top of freshly fried french fries, sour cream, cheese and guacamole for only $5?  Can't be beat, especially if you're hammered and it's 3 A.M. \n\nNot a classy joint, not a place you go if you're wary of stupid crap like \"health code violations\" (the best places never are), but definitely a late-night hot-spot for the Mill crowd.  Lovely.\n\nAnd it's not for sissies that don't like ham in their beans either, damnit.
