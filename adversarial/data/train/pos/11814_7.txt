The hotel isn't that bad, but I had a terrible experience. If you are coming to take a kid to a jacuzzi, it can't be this one. \n\nMy son is 5, and they wouldn't let him in the \"hot tub\". I get that there are liability issues, but there hot tub was COLD! The actual pool was warmer! My 5 year old wanted to go in a jacuzzi for his birthday. \n\nAnd if you agree 5 is too young, they don't let anyone under 16 in. I saw them kick a 12 and 14 year old out of their like warm tub too. Seems harsh. \n\nThey should have a waiver to sign so you won't sue them for whatever they are worried about. Golden Nugget, you suck.
