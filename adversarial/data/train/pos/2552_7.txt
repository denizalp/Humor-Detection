I hate writing negative reviews.. i really do, but man oh man, Gus's Diner is not something that lends itself to positive reviews.\n\nFood- gross, unhealthy\nCleanliness- dirty\nService- 2 thumbs down\nAmbiance- almost everyone in this place is pushing 350lbs... and shoveling food down their throats, as to keep that standard going. it's not a comfortable place to eat\n\nI have nothing nice to say..
