Alright! I wish I would have checked in here when we were visiting family members in Las Vegas, but I forgot to. Anyways, let me tell you what.... if you are in the area, and want to try something truly amazing, beyond amazing, go here and get a piece of their Bee Sting cake. I am not kidding you this is amazing stuff! We tried a lot of their items. We got a big box to go, and we did get doubles of a lot of things, but then I asked the lady who worked there what their most popular item was and she pointed to the Bee Sting cake, which didn't catch my eye at first. I told her to put one slice in the box. My boyfriend and I started eating all of the things on the way home (to California) and then we got to the final piece of Bee Sting cake. Let me tell you that once I tasted it, I was half tempted to make him turn around and drive back into Las Vegas to get me more of it. I did NOT want to share it with him! I started to whine. I told him it was the absolute BEST thing I have ever eaten! I whined about it because it was absolutely delicious, and I shoved it in my mouth and made a huge mess all over my face. I did have to share with him, because once he tasted it, he was whining for more. Damn! Cake never tasted so good! \n\nI love your Bee Sting cake! And, I will always stop here when I come to Vegas, just so I can order a lot of pieces of it! Yum!
