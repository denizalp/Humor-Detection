We have had SRP electric since 1973 and are very pleased with the service and rates (lower than APS and a fraction of what we had been paying to the Cleveland Electric Illuminating company before moving to AZ). \nThey gave us $30 cash to haul away our old fridge a couple of years ago and have many programs to help the environment. \nWe paid a small deposit to start our electric service in 1973 and that was refunded to us the next year and we have never had to pay another deposit (in spite of 3 changes of residence over the years).\nOur electric bill today is about the same as when we moved into this Tempe home in 1987. Why? Armed with information from SRP, we added sun screens to the windows, have more energy efficient appliances, and our 1987 air conditioner was 8SEER and our current ac is 16SEER. \nNo, we do NOT work for SRP, but appreciate that cost per KWH is lower in SRP served areas than almost anywhere else in the US.
