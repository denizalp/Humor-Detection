The taste of New York in the desert!\n\nI was introduced to Chompies at the spring fling at their Glendale location and instantly fell in love *cue the violons* ;)\n\nThey make their own mustard and pickles as any legit deli should. No Guldens or generic spicy mustard will disgrace my pastrami on rye sandwich! Lololol\n\nWhile I was there I noticed their bagel game was spot on! People were loading up bagfuls!!!!\n\nAnother thing I noticed is the menu is overwhelming not only to some customers and staff members I met in both locations I've been to so far. With that said I wonder if the company would be more profitable and in turn have better customer service if low selling items for each location are nixed from the everyday menu (maybe offer them as monthly specials or promotions)???\n\nI also tried some sweet treats:\n*peanut butter\/chocolate gluten free brownie - moist and delicious!!!\n*biscotti - meh, just ok\n*Mexican wedding cookies - did not enjoy\n*laceys - good\n\nAs others have already mentioned *sigh* service can be spotty depending on if you are not a regular, aren't dining in, did not order ahead or you just get a new person.\nBut, since the food quality is exceptional I'm willing to overlook it.\n\nDuring this visit I didn't want to bug the take out staff again so I asked one of the gals on the sit down restaurant side for a side of their wonderful mustard and she was so gracious enough to get me a side so I could thoroughly enjoy my sandwich. That customer care bumped my 3.25 experience up to a 4.\n\nHigh Yelp marks or not I hope Chompies will have continued success and hopefully open new locations in the future!
