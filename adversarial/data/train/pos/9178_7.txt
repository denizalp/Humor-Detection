I used El Cheapo for my final move in June of 2010 from Lawrence & Dupont to Warden & St. Clair, after being burnt by Miracle movers a year and a half before with a move from Winston Churchill & Eglinton to Lawrence & Dupont. (read my review).\n\nElCheapo was recommended by a co worker who had nothing but amazing things to say about them. Price-wise they were competitive; personel-wise they were amazing! The 2-man crew worked really hard. Very cheerful and respectful of client and property alike. I would recommend them any day, and would use them again in a heart beat! Don't let the name fool you - they may be priced right, but they are far from a cheap low quality outfit, their customer service is top notch.\n\nThey kept within budget and time, enough to move onto their next job as scheduled. Needless to say they got a big tip from me!
