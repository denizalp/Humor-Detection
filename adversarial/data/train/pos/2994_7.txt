I have visited this salon 2-3 times, once alone and 2 times with friends.  I've had 2 gel mani\/pedis and both times my fingernails will have visible paint lines, cracks, and chips within a week.  The pedicures are no issue because pedicures are almost always pretty decent and last a long time.  \n\nThe owner and her daughter are very friendly, but they have limited staff for the number of chairs they have available- something like 10 chairs and 2 ladies other than the owner.  My friend and I were turned away at 4pm on our 3rd visit and told to come back the next day!  I realize that it is reasonable to ask clients to call ahead and make appointments, but honestly there are a plethora of salons in Las Vegas (some cheaper with better quality) that accept walk-ins no matter how busy.\n\nThe best thing about Chloe Spa is that they use new liners with every customer and send you home with your buffer and nail file so that you know they are using new supplies every time.  There are also a lot of different color choices, but be warned that the new OPI longer-lasting nail polish doesn't last as long as promised on your fingers.
