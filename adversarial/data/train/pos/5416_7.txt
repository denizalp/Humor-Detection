We went to lunch here and I have got to say, it was pretty gross. I ordered the asian chicken salad with shrimp. It was literally a handful of lettuce with 5 shrimp on top. They were rubbery and tasted old. We also ordered the kids fish and chips for our toddler. It was gross as well. The fries tasted like they were cooked several hours before and and had a weird after taste. Everything was pretty bad - like - didn't want to pay for it, it was so bad.\n\nWith that begin said, it IS a bar. And we didn't exactly order 'bar food'. The Mister ate here before and got a burger and said it was great...so I don't know. I don't think I'll ever order food here again!
