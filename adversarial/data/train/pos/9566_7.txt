Waited an hour and 20 minutes for delivery, and received a cold, soggy, undercooked MESS of a pizza. I called the store, and was told no, I couldn't have a refund, and no, they would NOT be replacing my pizza. The guy on the phone was extremely rude, even yelling at me when I asked for a refund. \n\nHe said, well, we're certainly not coming out again tonight, and you have your food, so what do you want? Um... A pizza that's not half raw, cold and soggy? \n\nLuckily, I had ordered from eat24, and was able to obtain a refund from them directly.\n\nNasty pizza, and even nastier people. At least own up to and FIX your mistakes.
