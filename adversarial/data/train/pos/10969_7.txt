I always heard to try the buffets in Vegas but whenever I hear the word \"buffet,\" I think of mass-produced lo mein and grease. So when my Vegas group wanted to try the buffet at the Bellagio, I didn't know what to expect. We came here for lunch and I was overwhelmed with the amount of food there was! Jason S. had said the dinner here was to die for but we were pleasantly surprised that the lunch line wasn't long and for $20 a person there was a delicious variety of goodies to eat! The best part for me was the smoked salmon and fresh fruits. I was very shocked that they had such good food for such a steal! I haven't tried the dinner here but I do recommend lunch here. \n\nBring sweat pants, large muu-muu dresses, or pants with elastic waist bands because you'll want to eat EVERYTHING!
