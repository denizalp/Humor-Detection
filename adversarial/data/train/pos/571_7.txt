My husband and I went here for a Father's Day brunch. \nPros: \nThe decor was lovely. And the waiter was attentive....\n\nNegatives:\nPricey.  We paid over $70 for 2 people for brunch. (1 app, soup and 2 entrees, no alcohol).  \nFood was bland, not original or impressive.  Very Boring.\nSmall portions for the price.\nAnd worst of all - my husband got food poisoning right after eating there!!!!
