Oh how I've missed the original sliders from living in New York I used to get this tiny delicious melt in your mouth mini burgers!! I was extremely happy to be vacationing in Vegas & see that there've finally arrived on the west coast!!! \nThose who've written bad reviews obviously are those who probably eat at the Golden Arches & think that's good... From the smell & taste you can't go wrong here, with or without cheese love these little burgers!!! \nIf your not a beef person check out the chicken rings trust you'll leave satisfied!!!\nLove me some White Castle
