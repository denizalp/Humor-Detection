I have to say this place is good. I am not a person who likes to try anything different. \nI like what I like and that is it. I do not like to eat dinner food for Breakfast like my girlfriend does. Heehee\nSeriously, she will eat eggs for dinner and pasta with gravey for Breakfast.\nAnyway, pita Bread or Wrap it is a hard choice as they are both really good.\nThe portions of food are huge. Almost too much, but hey I am not complaining.\nI like my sandwhiches with Garlic,not tahini.\n\nChicken is really good and I do not normally go for chicken.\nEvery thing seems to be really fresh I must say and the salads are great.
