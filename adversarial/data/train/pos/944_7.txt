ugh, these guys are such crooks. some of it is they're lazy and uncaring...another part of it is they know what they're doing, ripping customers off, but simply don't give a day-um.\n\na few times over the years i went in here looking to maybe purchase a bike, but was turned off by the indifferent-to-non-existent customer service i received. fast forward to a few months ago, when i was looking to buy a middle-of-the-road bike: not the cheapest\/not the most expensive. about $650-$750 or so. i checked Target, Wal-Mart and the big box stores, but the crappy bikes there for $250-$350 were just not quality enough. Bike Barn is in my neighborhood, so i thought to give it a try, despite the negative energy i received in the past from this place.\n\ni ended up spending around $750 on a Trek bike sold to me by a bedraggled old guy (50something with glasses) who looks like he lives on a bike trail. fair enough i thought...he probably knows his stuff, seeing as how he looks like he lives for biking. BIG MISTAKE. they had to assemble my bike in the store. they did. i rode it home and immediately noticed the wheels were out-of-alignment, the seat was unstable and there was a persistent weird clicking noise as the wheels turned.\n\nsimply put, they assembled the bike improperly. WWWAAAYYY improperly. \n\ni'll spare you the details, but i went back THREE TIMES to have this problem fixed and FINALLY the woman (50s-ish?) owner of the joint stepped in and had her seemingly best guy fix the problem. NO APOLOGY. nothing. despite me wasting several hours of my workday on to-and-from trips to this chop shop when i should have been able to buy a new bike assembled properly the first time.\n\ni also had an issue with this place where soon after the Trek bike purchase, i encountered a flat tire. as an act of goodwill Bike Barn offered to fix the problem for free. they didn't replace the tire when they said they would. they simply replaced the inner tube and (poorly) patched the old tire; i know this because several months later my \"new, fixed\" tire was flat in the exact same place (semi-large hole spewing air). in short, their patch job, which they said WAS A NEW TIRE, failed.\n\nCROOKS. LIARS. CHEATS. they seriously give the bike community a bad, shady name.\n\nthe nice Arcadia location and cutesy pootsy barn building is tempting...\"hey, there's a cute bike shop in the nice part of town.\" but MAN...buyer beware. if you spend money here, from my experience, you will get a substandard product priced at a premium that may or may not be assembled correctly, you will be shortchanged on repairs, and will generally be treated with customer contempt on a Lux Coffee-level of disdain. \n\nA-V-O-I-D.\n\nUPDATE (9\/9\/15): also, i notice on the Yelp reviews for Bike Barn, the owner type person replies to all with a \"thanks for supporting\" for positive reviews, and a \"hey man, you're wrong and\/or give us another try\" for negs. people are too busy to give your business second, third and sometimes even FOURTH chances. rather than be so vigilant on Yelp and eyeing your business' reviews like a hawk (lame, easy to complain about customer response after-the-fact), get in the damn store and take care of your customers IN-PERSON, price your products fairly, and for the love of gosh, be NICE to people when they are actually spending their time in your business and SPENDING their hard-earned money to support your livelihood. during several trips to Bike Barn over the course of three years, i encountered bad service every time. we will never go back. why? there are other options and you, Bike Harm, don't deserve business because you don't treat people well. if i have to drive an extra 15 mins to downtown Phoenix or East Valley, fine.
