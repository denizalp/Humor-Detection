This place was a mystery to me for months. I had no idea they were even open. All I saw was a darkened storefront next to that Round Corner Bar, Hotel, Cantina, whatever. Well, after cruising by today, I could tell that they were officially in business. \n\nAt 4pm my break arrives. I attempt to cross Butler Street, Lawrenceville's River Acheron,and all I can see at this point is the faint image of a brunette who is either indifferent to me or hoping I don't make it over.\n\nSome siren she makes, eh? The other two didn't seem to care if I crashed into the rocks either. One made sure her face was in her iPad.\n\n\"Please don't hit on me, please don't hit on me,\" her word balloon said. \n\nI read minds for fun, not profit. \n\nAnyway, when I get inside, after my harrowing yet brief trip, I'm greeted by the owner\/operator, a Michael Imperioli look-alike who was friendly enough to me despite my disheveled appearance (did the girls think I was homeless or just another ineligible bachelor?) and seemed to appreciate my break-time visit. \n\nAccording to him, they've been in business since June 1. A City Paper review (man those two get pithy! there 'aint much to this place!) was on the wall.\n\nMy heart sank with the realization that I wouldn't have a \"first\" this time, but once I got the gyro I ordered back to work (just a quick block or two away) and in my mouth, such trivial matters were forgotten. \n\nI figured I'd test him on the basics. This was anything but basic, however and was quite innovative.\n\nHe pulls out a meatloaf, which he explains is a mixture of lamb and beef, whacks off a few thin slices, and essentially turns the whole thing into a gyro panino. \n\nPita bread takes on a whole new personality when you panino it. It gets all grilled, and crispy, and in this case merges with large tomato chunks, diced onions, and that magic Tzatziki (sounds like the name of a forgotten sorceror-hero from the Golden Age of comics ) sauce to take your palate from a busy street to a quiet meadow. Impressive.\n\nThe gyro was also served with a little side salad that came in a Chinese takeout box. Clever. The dressing it came with was pretty good, but I could have used a little more of it. \n\nThe baklava (another standard on which to test a Greek eatery), passed with a B+.  It was oily enough, chewy enough, and was as flaky as a New Ager. \n\nMy gyro, salad, baklava, and bottle of Coca Cola cost me $10.57. So they're not too, too pricey either which this anti-gentrifier is glad for.\n\nNice, clean place + nice kid runnin' the show + affordable prices + very close to work= welcome addition to the neighborhood. I shall  become a semi-regular at the very least. \n\nWhich reminds me; I've been neglectin' Deli down the street.  They probably think I died.
