These guys suck, they are rude and apparently these z list celebs feel they are on the a list, the staff only come in when the producers feel someone has a valuable item and they are pumped with information before they get filmed. Everything is over priced so know they totally rip people off. The store is like a hole in  the wall garage sized store and im not talking about hole in the the wall as in good im mean a hole in the wall with maggots and rats living in it, but hey the show is ok, just dont fall for this tourist trap!
