Simple oil change was the desire and told them thats all I wanted them to do up front. Grief and dissapointment was what I got. Took way longer than estimated. Every person to come through got the talk about what was needed extra in a high pressure way. Same for me. Told my rotors were paper thin and they wouldn't just \"pad slap\" them or my brakes might explode out on the highway. Really? Never asked them to check the brakes. Told them no to heir high dollar fix. Went home and checked them with some calipers and they were within tolerance and looked fine (no scoring apparent). Told my air filter was filthy and badly needed replacement (at their much inflated parts price). I never asked them to check this. Anyway I checked the air filter 2 days before (not filthy at all) and bought a Fram replacement (just hadn't put it in yet). Well the butthead mechanic broke one of the tabs off to the housing when putting it back on. Doh! Thanks Tuffy for the new problem you caused on something I didn't want checked! They should rename this place \"Tuff Luck\". \nMy advice: STAY AWAY!!!
