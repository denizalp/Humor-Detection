Fortunately the usual faces that give me a hard time wasn't here today. This Teddy Bear of a guy was so sweet when he approached my car and didnt rush me. Also,  the guy who wipes the windows and promotes the AUTO GLASS with your insurance was not only really cute (I think Hispanic, slicked back hair,  glasses) but super friendly and not pushy about the whole thing. Everyone was great today and TODAY is the reason why I do continue to go back. Majority of the guys there look tough,  but they are super friendly and sweet. My car looks new and shiny and people can't stop admiring it. \nUnfortunately there are some losers that work there that spoil it for everyone else.
