I've been to The Joint 3 times--once in the old Joint and twice in the newer, enlarged Joint.\n\nFor the current Joint, the flow of people in and out was well designed but I wonder why they didn't install a reversible escalator so part of the crown could go downstairs that way and the rest by stairs.\n\nFor this concert of KISS, I got balcony seating.  I liked it better than floor seating because I found the floor seating to be very tightly packed next to each other.  The balcony on the other hand had theatre style seats that were comfortable.\n\nThe sound and lighting in the Joint are exceptional.  Needless to say, KISS had a lot of pyro effects and the lighting was great.  It would be nice if they could have raised the catwalk.  It was in the way for some of the stage viewing.\n\nThere aren't too many shows that I would go here to see but if I went again, I'd try to get a table seat on the side balconies.\n\nAs a tip, park in the Paradise garage for easy access to the Joint.
