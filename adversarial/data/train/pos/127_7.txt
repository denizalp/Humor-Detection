Oh my god, did you see how big those things are?? Like in your face huge! Get your mind out of the gutter, I'm talking about the nacho's. Yes, the amount of silcone came in a close second size-wise, but the nacho's were bloody huge. The taste was alright, but nothing to get excited over for this nacho conniseur.\n\nFood, meh. Ambiance, meh. Cider selection, miniscule. The group I was with was great though, so I had a great evening talking with friends and playing NTN trivia. \n\nIt was pretty quiet for a Saturday night, which suits me fine really. At least we got good service. The waitress had no choice but to pay attention to us since we were her only table.\n\nI don't know what the guys below are talking about, these chicks have great racks (I'm sure they're all putting themselves med school, right?) and slamming bodies. Besides, I challenge Brian S. to walk around slinging beers in a tiny skirt and little more than a bra and see how unforgiving the ladies are with his shape. \n\nGood enough for a Saturday night out, but nothing special.
