I went here on a cold December weeknight expecting to be comforted by lots of great KBBQ.  I was disappointed by the 1) service 2) the small portion sizes and 3) the taste of their soup.\n\nWe ordered the 2 person beef combo for over $64.  I didn't like that we couldn't cook our own food and the service wasn't very attentive at times.  It took over 15 minutes to get the check and wrap up.  The portions were small compared to other KBBQ places I've been to in LA.  I left hungry.  The kimchi stew was not very flavorful and the ingredients were very hard.  I would not recommend this for anyone looking for a fantastic experience.  If you're craving meat and are willing to pay a premium for it, sadly this is the closest you'll find without driving out to LA.
