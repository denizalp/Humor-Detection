I feel absolutely horrible for giving a 2-star review of this place. \nAs a Morningside resident, I was really hoping to love and support the Pizza Haus. I ordered pizza from here for the first time a few days ago. I was probably the worst pizza I've ever had in Pittsburgh. \nThe price was great, but that was the only thing that was a plus. The crust was very tough. The sauce was so incredibly bland. And there was just an insane amount of cheese.\nNever in my household has a pizza been left unfinished (left over cold pizza is the best breakfast of course!), but we threw away probably 1\/3 of the large pie. \nI'll give it another shot and try the hoagies, but I'm going to permanently pass on the pizza.
