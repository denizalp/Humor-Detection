Wow, why hasn't anyone yelped Martin Lawrence? \nThis is a BEAUTIFUL art gallery. Clean, spacious and extremely pro-art with an IMPRESSIVE collection worth billions of dollars. Private viewing rooms with full screen TVs & guaranteed art handlers that insure your art will be in mint condition when you receive them. This is extremely important if you plan on collecting these art pieces and eventually sell them for double what you purchased for =)\nBUt what was the definitive moment that forced me to give this gallery a 5 stars? it all had to do with the knowledge, enthusiasm and passion of Micah Wright, a fine art consultant. She knew and loved Takashi Murakami & his work, just like me. She gave us a mini lecture \/ meaning behind many of his work. Which i might add, was a HUGE collection of his work at this location. (Between 20-30 pieces!) \nMicah reawakened my passion and appreciation for art. She made me want to buy a $5000 piece of art!! now that's pretty darn cool.\nShe was amazing & this gallery is amazing. The prices are slightly higher than many of the other galleries but they handle everything super professional with a 100% guarantee behind every piece you buy here.\nMUST VISIT!!!!
