Disney Fine Art presented by Magical Memories is located within Container Park on Fremont St in Downtown Vegas. It's located on the right side, just through the front entrance. If you're a fan of Disney and you have a little money to burn, this gallery is perfect for you. The store isn't spacious, but big enough where they hang up a decent selection of both framed and canvas prints.\n\nAs a Disney Parks AP holder for the past several years, and I enjoyed checking out all the amazing Disney inspired artwork in all the various stores within both theme parks. This Disney Fine Art store has quite a few cool pieces that I've never seen before, and a wide range too -- not just strictly Mickey Mouse stuff.\n\nPrices at this gallery are in line with everywhere else -- whether online, in the parks, or at the Wonderland Gallery at Downtown Disney in Anaheim. If you don't find what you're looking for, be sure to ask because they have more artwork in storage.
