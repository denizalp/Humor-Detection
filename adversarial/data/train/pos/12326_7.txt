My first visit to Amelie's and I am a lifelong, hymn-singing devotee.  I knew I can expect quality goodies from the many reviews I read, but to try them in real time was another experience.  I went in after a late lunch with my sister (we saved our dessert space specifically for Amelies)  Stepping in, the insides were soooooo cute, just makes you want to stay in for a couple hours :)  All the desserts looked simply indulgent, and it was hard to select just 2-3 items.  I love tea cakes, but when I couldnt decide between the raspberry and lemon, the lovely lady said she would choose raspberry--as did I.  And Im glad I did because it was so light yet rich and flavorful.  Light because I didnt feel the need for milk with it :-D  I also got a Palmier (very crispy and buttery) and a cinnamon stick.  I chose smaller and lighter things because I had a big lunch.  I will be back to sample everything else, and more time on my hands.\nThe service was excellent, even with a line behind me, the person behind the counter patiently waited while I selected.  Everyone was nice, helpful and fast.
