High end burger joints seem to be the going trend. Flip Side is one of the more recent additions in downtown Hudson.\n\nThe burger was great. I got the Smokey, with smoked brisket and smoked gouda. Great smoked flavor and it didn't even need the BBQ sauce. I ordered the Shitake Mushrooms and Asparagus Tempura side. It was great, the breading was super thin and crisp, although very small as other reviewers have pointed out. I could have used a few more mushroom caps. The alcoholic shake really hit the spot.\n\nOur server was super friendly and the wait wasn't too bad for anything. The decor is cool. Lots of distressed stucco. The bathroom situation is weird. The sister joint next door, One Red Door, shares the hallway with the restrooms. There are about 5 doors that look the same in that hallway. When you go to the restroom, make a mental note of where you went, otherwise you will end up in Red Door's kitchen. They really could use some signage. I felt like I was in a maze. \n\nOverall, great food and drinks. But be prepared to fork over some cash.
