Thought I reviewed this place already but, I guess not. Five Stars and I'll keep returning. Just had a bad experience at another place and came straight here. I love their Bolognese at Amaro, though I'm ordering the Lasagna tonight, yes i've had it before, yes it is good. It's all about Comfort Food, baby. If you do go, call me I'll join ya.
