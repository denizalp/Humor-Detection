After the club is the after party...because no one wants to go home at 4am in Vegas! Drai's is a hit or miss in my opinion.\n\nThe first time I went there, I came with two Vegas locals and 4 girls after a night out at Marquee\/Tao. We didn't have a problem getting in, danced all morning, and didn't leave until 8am. The only bad thing was when we first got there and walked down the stairs, this drunk ass girl was peeing as she was stumbling up the stairs to leave. We were BEYOND disgusted...like girl CONTAIN YOURSELF\/YOUR BLADDER. However the music was good and the shots kept on coming so it was soon forgotten. \n\nThis most recent time I was in Vegas, I was super excited to go back to Drai's because I had such a blast the first time (minus peeing girl incident)...but it was pretty empty at 3am and the guy at the door kept us (3 girls) waiting for a good 10-15mins! These dudes kept on walking by and handing the doorman $100s...so I guess I can understand. The music was pretty ehh this time and the whole environment was just not as fun. Maybe it was because it was a Thursday night?\n\nI would have given Drai's 4.5 stars based off of my first experience (I've never gone out and danced from legit 10pm to 8am before) but would probably give it 2.5 for my second experience! I have another Vegas trip planned in a couple of month's for a friend's bachelorette party...so we'll see how I feel after my 3rd time!
