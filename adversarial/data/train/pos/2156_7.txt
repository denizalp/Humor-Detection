Front desk staff here is very unprofessional. They're very loud in stating information to patients on other side of desk. I heard them refusing to take patients because of co pay but it was embarrassing to some people to be hearing patients information. One receptionist was making fun of a patient when they left saying was that person a he\/she a shim a man woman? Very unprofessional and the wait times are crazy! I would never come back here.
