Frozen custard. Exactly what the hell is it, anyway? Please allow me to share what I've learned. If anything, it'll save you a few seconds of wasted Wikipedia time.\n\nFrozen Custard: In the U.S., the Food and Drug Administration requires products marketed as frozen custard to contain at least 10 percent milkfat and 1.4 percent egg yolk solids. If it has a smaller percentage of egg yolk solids, it is considered ice cream.\n\nThere, now you know that frozen custard is just eggy ice cream.\n\nNow admittedly, I'm more of an ice cream guy on those rare occasions when I actually crave a frozen dessert, but sometimes nothing but the smooth, creamy texture of custard will do. And for this, my friends, you cannot go wrong when confronted by the Northeast Ohio staple that is East Coast Frozen Custard.\n\nWhile I didn't grow up on East Coast (my childhood ice cream shop was the Ripple Cream in Elyria) I can see how some would have a deep, emotional attachment to the joint. It's pure Ohio nostalgia in a cone - or cup if that's more your thing. They've also got concretes, which are essentially their version of the DQ Blizzard. Take some stuff, blend it up with custard, there's your concrete.\n\nMy wife's a fan of their chocolate custard topped with bits of Butterfinger. Me? I'm a coconut cream guy. Whatever your fancy, they've probably got you covered custard-wise.\n\nFriendly service, picnic tables outside, it's pretty simple and pretty damn good.
