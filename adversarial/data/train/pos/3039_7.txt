I feel Settebello has earned the 5-star from me; I have been numerous times for lunch, dinner, and happy hour. They never disappoint. \n\nThe food is so fresh, authentic, and always consistent. They have a genuine and vibrant staff with a relaxed, casual atmosphere. \n\nEven though it's not the most convenient, I will continue to visit often, as they are easily the best pizza I've had in Henderson and so much more!
