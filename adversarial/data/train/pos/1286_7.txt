Came here for Yelp Spring Break... dressed in Zombie gear (right after the Zombie Yelp Neon event).\n\nWe got a great deal through yelp - Free photo and entry for $44. The Photo itself is $20. So we got that included in our admission. We also got a free calendar with the check in. (I have three 2012 Chippendale calendars but I plan on giving them away - the fiance doesn't fancy the half naked men). \n\nThis seating format is very different from Thunder from Down Under. This was like regular seats - no tables. \n\nLots of bachelorettes and birthdays going on. They like that. They usually take the bachelorettes on stage :D\n\nAgain... cheesy boyband dancing and singing... but what makes this different than the other shows (Thunder Down Under, Hollywood Men) is that one guy actually sings (and well) and another plays the bass guitar\/electric guitar (whoa). So that was kinda cool. It was like a performance than a clothing optional performance. \n\nThere are men who take it off with each dance move... and they take it off... no penis. no balls. They just show their bare butts. They face away from the audience and rip off their thongs or shorts and show their butts... no penises. \n\nOnly the few girls who get chosen to go up on stage get to see what's on the other side of the stage - penis... or in my mind... a sock over a penis. \n\nThey do dance off stage and into the crowd. I got a kiss on my nonzombie side of the cheek. Nice. \n\nI was with my friends and one of my friends was gay - the host actually called him out not knowing he was gay \"The only guy here - he's totally going to get laid by his girlfriend tonight\"... whaaaaa... hahahaha please. My friend is enjoying this more than us girls. :D The host finally realized my friend was gay when we took the group photo with the guys.\n\nAs part of Yelp Spring Break, I gave each of the dancers a Yelp Pin. They looked good. The host even gave Yelp Elites a Shoutout during the show. Awesome. Represent!\n\nThe host was hilarious and very good looking. He was a dancer as well. \n\nThe server was also pretty buff. It was like whoa. Buff black guy serving us! :D\n\nThe only problem I had with the show... a lot of the guys were not coordinated. I'm sorry. I love dancing. I watch dance competitions and shows ALL the time. I need coordination. Some of these guys didn't remember some of the moves. I know they're half naked and all... but it bothered me hahaha... but they all looked good. They just need to work on the dance moves.\n\nNOTES:\n* No cameras or taking photos of ANY kind. If they catch you... you're out.\n* $20 to take a photo with them\n* They sell the outfit (bow tie and cuffs) at the store for $24\n* Need to work on their coordination\n* One guy sings really well\n* If you want to be picked, you need to to go nuts and look hot - and be a bachelorette\n* They give a shirt away at the end but a older lady just walked up to the stage and grabbed it hahahaha\n\nAll ladies go nuts. I was like whoa. It's just half naked guys. Ladies were pushing us to get in line. I was laughing so hard. Really? :P\n\nFun show. Take your bachelorette girlfriend here and try to get her on stage - she may be able to see some penis. One bachelorette got to put undies and PJs on one of the dancers. He was full monty in front of her (butt to us). So... good luck ladies. ;)
