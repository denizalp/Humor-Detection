Do one thing at this institution:  order the strawberry shortcake.  It's pricy but it's a monstrous good old fashioned smile-maker.  My son had the most shit-eating grin I've ever seen on his face when the waitress smashed it down in front of him and said:  Good Luck brave man.  And then she gave me a wink and a spoon.  Loved it.
