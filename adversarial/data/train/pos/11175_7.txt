I came back here because some friends wanted to come here.  I had a big lunch because I knew I didn't want to eat a lot here.  So I made the collassal mistake of ordering a salad.  Ordering a salad in a sports bar somewhat akin to ordering a cheeseburger in a Mexican restaurant.   This is not their speciality, so it's a gamble.  Well, sure enough, it was the worst salad I have ever eaten, and at $9, a complete rip off.  I think what happened is the other people with me ordered food that had to be cooked and they made the salad at the same time and then let it sit at room temperature (or possibly under a heat lamp?).  It was clearly room temperature.  Let me clarify by saying, I'm not a very finnicky eater.  Check my other reviews, I mostly give 4-5 stars.  But this was awful.   \n\nOn the plus side, they hire attractive girls as waitresses, and since it was a Monday we got excellent service since they didn't have a lot of tables.  It's weird because this place has definite potential for actually being a really cool place.  We all commented about how they need bigger TVs.  Instead of 5 TVs of the 32 inch vareity on one huge wall, they need to replace those with four or five 55 or 60 inch TVs.  In fact, they should replace ALL their TVs to be bigger, minus the ones at the bar.  Because this place is huge, so when you are sitting far away you need to be able to see.   What does this place do at night?  Like I said, it's a HUGE facility.  They could definitely have live bands, karaoke, a dance floor with DJ, stand up comedy, trivia nights... SOMETHING.  Maybe they do have that, but I didnt' see it advertised.  \n\nAnyways, that's just my 2 cents.  My friend said they do a couple million dollars a year of business, so maybe they don't need my suggestions.  Still, it couldn't hurt to make some changes.  I doubt I will ever go back here.  If you do order something- get a burger and fries or some fried foods.  Stay away from complicated things like salads.
