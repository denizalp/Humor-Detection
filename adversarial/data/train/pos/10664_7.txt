I end up at Gluuteny every single time I visit Squirrel Hill because I want to love this bakery, and now that I've tried almost all their offerings in the way of prepared goods I can safely say, \"It's okay.\"  \n\nTheir brownies ($2.50) are the best thing they make in my book: they're better than most \"normal\" brownies. So good they don't taste gluten-free? Hell yeah, I'll make that claim!\n\nThe pumpkin and lemon loafs ($5) are addictive: I ate one small loaf in a day...by myself...and then I ate another one...don't judge me! The pumpkin tart ($2.50) is also really good.\n\nThe muffins ($2) come in blueberry, orange cranberry and chocolate chip, and are on the spongy side but their flavor is spot on. \n\nThe cookies ($2), however, aren't done right; the sugar cookies are slathered in what can only be described as a suspicious amount of frosting. The other varieties, like chocolate chip and walnut chocolate chip, are just too crunchy to be enjoyable. What can I say? I like soft cookies.\n\nIf you're gluten-free this is a good place to stock up on pizza crust and pancake mixes, bread, muffins or any other pastry mix your heart desires; the lady in front of me bought fifty bucks worth of stuff!\n\nThe girls behind the counter that rock some of the cutest haircuts in all of PGH are willing to answer any questions or explain that you need to cook the pizza at a higher temperature to get the crust the right texture. Plus, you can order birthday cakes.
