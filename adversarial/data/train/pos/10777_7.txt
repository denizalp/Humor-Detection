This place has the greatest chicken kabobs ever, they are never burnt and always super juicy. The marinade is delicious! They say it takes 15 min because they are cooked to order, but I swear I have never waited more than 8 min for it to arrive. A plate comes with 3 sides and is usually always choose tabouli, hummus and baba. It's always served with just enough pita and the plate is filling for $9. It's really hard not to come here every day for lunch.  I crave the tabouli, they make it the best, just a little bit of bulgar wheat and lots of lemon juice and the onions and tomatoes are expertly diced. The service is unbelievably friendly and parking is adequate. The place is super close to asu and mcc so it's a great spot for lunch or study break food. I notice you can also call ahead and order pick up. They grocery also has great products and some fun frozen foods to try. Now if only I could just eat more I'd order the princess platter all for myself!
