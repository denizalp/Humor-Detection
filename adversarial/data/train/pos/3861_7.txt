Love it.  MAD Greens is one of the few restaurants where I walk out feeling refreshed and energized instead of thinking that I need to find a dark area where I can take a food coma nap.  The service is friendly, the owners have an awesome genuine mission, and the prices are fair for the quality that you get.  Even the fountain sodas taste bubbly and light.  My favorite salads are the Edgar Allan Poe (steak and blue cheese) and the Don Quixote... oh, the Don Quixote.  I usually am not a fan of chicken in salad, but the chicken here is so tasty.  It's juicy, soft, and obviously slow roasted - there's none of that blobby rubbery fat that fast food restaurant salads have.  Pairing that with avocado, that salad is definitely my favorite.\n\nDefinitely recommend stopping by, especially if you want to feel alert and ready to go for a hike after eating instead of groggy.
