We made reservations 6 weeks in advance for a birthday celebration,\nonly to learn, that our table was given away after 15 minutes past our reserve time! \nThe 13 year old Assistant Manager offered us a seat at the counter, which was not acceptable to us, a couple in their 50's and wanting to experience the tasting menu ($155.00 per person).\nOther fine dining establishments have a 30 minutes grace period\nexactly for reasons we experienced: Full valet parking and construction on Las Vegas Boulevard.\nShame on you for treating your customers this way!
