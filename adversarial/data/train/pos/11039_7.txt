That was not a croissant. \n\nIt's advertised as one, sold as one, but no: it was a dense loaf of bread shaped to look like a croissant, glazed on top with some unidentifiable sweetness. A solid disappointment if there ever was one in the croissant department. Do some folks not know what these are? They are the best-know gem in the world of morning pastries. Croissants are light, buttery, flakey, and golden; the opposite of which this was is heavy, dry, spongy, and monochromatic. \nThis was sacrilege. \n\nCoffee?  Coffee is served in a gas-station inspired paper cup, even if you're staying for a spell. The taste was similar. Not bad, but not memorable. \n\nHow about atmosphere, you ask? Cupz is clean. Big windows. Kind of goes for the Modern Blah motif. Free wi-fi. The killer, though, what chases a seated customer out the door: a display case cooler rattling out of control. Isn't this place new? Why the faulty equipment? An endless annoyance turning off, then on, then off, then ON again. SHUT UP. JUST SHUT UP. \n\nSo why the generous three stars? Two reasons:\n-- they offer fresh-fruit smoothies, which is a rarity in this town. I just hope they are good. Bonus just for offering. \n-- a super-sweet young woman serving by herself. She was cheerful, helpful, patient, and just an easy-going delight. \n\nThe latter was even more notable because I soon overheard the owner\/manager some others have griped about in their reviews. I'm the only customer in there so I can't imagine how anything could be stressful at the moment, but he's swearing and giving gruff directions to this cool chick like some dude wrestling with his inner machismo. How she remains upbeat with him as her only company, I dunno. So far as I can tell, she's the best thing going for Cupz, so maybe chill out, stressball. \n\nI'd stop in if I needed a coffee or smoothie on my way to\/from Blue or RedRock, but not worth going out of one's way for.
