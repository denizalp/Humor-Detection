Pinks, i expected more from you! \nI stood in lines 2 hours for you in LA and thought you were a little better than average. Then i come to Las Vegas to try you again with barley any lines, and you were not great to me at all! I am totally breaking up with you. \n\nI tried the spicy dog and chilli cheese fries. Both were okay and had nothing special about them. This place is small, expensive for what you get, and seating is only outside. This place is truly overrated.
