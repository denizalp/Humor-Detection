02.05.10\n\nStopped in for a drink in what we were hoping to be a bar hop.  Too bad we ran out of time before we got to hit all the bars.\n\nI've never tried the raspberry velvet [http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/rW5N-fiNhqb-fR3bGqyPdg?select=bzp23ZITJ1nd2sGbj0Oflg].  I've never drank Guinness through a straw before, either.\n\nGuinness + Chambord = mighty tasty.
