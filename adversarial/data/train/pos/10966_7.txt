I love pizza and I'm partial to the thin crust pizza. Their thin crust pizza is excellent. It's cut into squares (Chicago Style) instead of slices. It makes eating the pizza much easier and it allows the crust lovers to only eat the pieces around the edge. I think their ingredients are fresh and of good quality.\n\nSo why only four stars? That's because their deep dish pizza has too much sauce and really didn't taste too good fresh out of the oven. The pizza really improves when it's heated up the next day.\n\nThis is a take out location on the north side of Shea Rd near Mountainside Fitness.
