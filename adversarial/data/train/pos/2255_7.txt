Grapevine: because I have had one-out-of-three okay experiences here, I will give you a three star.. but I really feel like you are still a 2...\n\nI forgot what a mistake the nachos were. In fact, the bartender served them with chili, and when me and Mr. Gold kindly explained we are vegetarians and do not eat chili, he scoffed and gave us the worst case of stink eye I have ever experienced. I'm sorry, if I am paying nine god damned dollars for some nachos, they better be right.\n\nGranted it was a busy Saturday night, but the service was not good. It took forever to get a drink even though I was sitting at the bar. And again, that nasty douche bag of a waiter was such a prick. Ummm.. HELLO... I am buying shit from you and your freaking tip is going to depend on your attitude. \n\nThe one completely redeeming thing about The Grapevine is that the karaoke is pretty awesome. Pretty much everyone back in the pit sings along, so it really becomes like one big group voice ringing out in the night.\n\nLet me give some of you a piece of advice, though... don't select songs that are downers that will make me want to slit my wrists. ESPECIALLY if you cannot sing. That is just NOT fair.
