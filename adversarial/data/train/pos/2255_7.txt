Home of the $20 all u can eat rice with a garnish of raw fish. The hand rolls are laughable: they are huge, and look like black skinned larvae engorged with crunchy rice.\n\nThe rice in the Nigiri and rolls was the worst I've tasted at any Japanese restaurant. Hard and flavorless, it was utterly unacceptable. Tasted like there was no vinegar or seasoning whatsoever.\n\nThe waitresses run around like rush hour traffic, bumping into each other and the teppan cooks. \n\nThe place was packed, which was unbelievable. Life's too short to eat bad sushi, people!!\n\nCaveat Emptor.
