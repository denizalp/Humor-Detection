Bogeys Grill is the sports bar that every local should know about. Their wings are better than the other sports bars I've been to on both taste and price. 8.95 for a pound of wings or $0.55 per bone-in wing on Mondays. Stand alone, chipotle bbq is my favorite but I've found a magic combination that I must share -- their honey hot wings with ranch dressing will make you mix as much together as you can and want to lick the plate. Plus, the service is the best there is for bars and their food ALWAYS comes out piping hot right as its finished cooking. \n\nThe atmosphere is great, they've got jenga towers, pool tables, outdoor seating, lots of tvs, a wii, wifi, and even a shuffleboard. Can't ask for more from a local bar
