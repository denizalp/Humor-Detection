I left my heart in Las Vegas. At Ronald's donuts, to be exact. Every time I make the trip out to LV, I make it a point to score a box of donuts + holes. Those delicious, perfect pillows of heavenly goodness- it only makes sense that Ronald's is in Sin City. Vegan donuts? Now that HAS to be the work of the devil.\n\nBut I can't help it. I'll be in Vegas next month for Ronald's donuts, I mean, my friend's birthday.
