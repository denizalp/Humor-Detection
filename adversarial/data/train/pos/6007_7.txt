We bought a groupon for one hour of lessons and have no regrets! My sister-in-law and I had a fantastic time. She even wants to look for archery places in Chicago to take her friends.\n\nThe instructor is super kind and chill. She doesn't make you feel weird or stupid for not knowing anything about archery - or accidentally picking up your bow before everything was clear.\n\nI would definitely come back here again for some bow-and-arrow unwinding!
