So we finally decided to give Cibo another chance and I'm so glad we did!\n\nI love love love their patio. It's very cute and romantic especially with all the lights wrapped around the trees. The heaters keep you warm on a chilly night and it's much quieter than their indoor space. This place is a great date spot. \n\nWe both had the Prosciutto Cruda pizza and had wanted to try the burrata, but unfortunately they'd been out of it for the last week so we ordered the bruschetta instead. Our waiter also recommended the Valpolicella Ripasso, which was ok, but it was a little light for our tastes. The pizza was really good (the fresh ingredients really come through), but we weren't the biggest fans of the crust. I like something more substantial and airy. But  for a thin crust pizza it wasn't soggy at all. A big plus! The bruschetta was also ok (don't get me wrong I still ate all of it and would order it again), but each bite just needs a little more of a punch. \n\nService was great and we met Karen, the owner, before we left and she is a doll. We had a much better experience this time around and we will certainly be back.
