Wanting to try something new at Crossroads, I stopped at Anatolia & ordered their eggplant dinner for lunch. Was slightly off put, when the guy grabbed one of the plate of salads that I thought was on display and promptly smothered it in tzatziki. I had to ask for another one, because I can't have dairy and he did nothing to hide the annoyance on his face. Nor did he ask me which of their salads I wanted, even though they had a variety, and I was stuck with a quarter of a plate of tabouli that I couldn't eat either (gluten). I bit my tongue, because I was hungry and reasoned with myself that the plate full of rice; salad & baked eggplant was more than enough food. For about $10 with a drink, the price is right.\n\nThe eggplant was average. It had taken on the flavors of the tomato based sauce it had been baked in, but it was greasy and a little on the sour side. Fine, if you're just eating it with the mountain of rice they give you, but not when pairing it with the already lemon-heavy salads.\n\nDidn't feel so hot for the rest of the day, after visiting this place. With so many other options in the market, I think I'll stick to the options I know will make me happy.
