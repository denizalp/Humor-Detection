Basically I've been here a few times before and it wasn't THAT busy and the food was good. They offer you up to 2 different broths if you ask for it. And they also offer you as many veggies or meat as you can eat any extra not eaten is extra charge. Last time I've been there the service was actually decent. The man sat us down right away and we served pretty quickly but this was pretty near closing so I mean we were pretty much the only customers besides some other people that were already eating. The old man that took our order was very sweet he gave us all the sauces and he taught us how to use them with what meat and etc. he even told us don't drink too much of the soup since it's not homemade soup, and that there's msg in it obviously. I really liked this old man he was a very good server, I felt bad because they stayed like maybe 20 mins past closing just for us to eat. 24.95 for all you can eat hot pot is pretty well worth it in my opinion especially when they allow you to order two soup broths at the SAME TIME. Like they have pots that split in the middle so you can put up to two broths (one really spicy and one healthy broth) and I always like to choose that option bc now there's variety!! I'd probably recommend to my friends and probably bring them here for dinner too it's a really good deal. This restaurant is in the palms casino though so you gotta look for it a little
