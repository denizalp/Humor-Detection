Camden fairways are beautiful apartments inside and out. The inside is updated and spacious and the outside is always cleaned. The prices are very worth what you get. The office staff are wonderful, always very friendly and helpful. As well as the maintainence staff. And best of all,when you put in a work order it is done quickly, ive never waited for more than a day.\n \n  The reason for the loss of one star is because-\n#1- being on the first floor sucks, you can hear everything upstairs and walking around sounds like a stampede!! We had loud neighbors a few months ago and now some kids are above. No need to alarm clock now. Get 2nd floor. Or ask about who lives upstairs.\n  #2- the people who clean the grounds are very rude. I've had to wash my car about 4 times now because they have no problem brushing all the crap onto my car. Once I left my window down and that crap got in my car. Also I've had them blow stuff up to my doorstep, and leave it! All this grass, twigs, trash and butts. Are you serious? Ballsy! \n  Other than that. Great place!
