Arguably the best burger in Cleveland, don't come here if you don't want old-style, greasy-spoon dining.  But if you don't mind delicious, fatty burgers in wax paper, served by waitresses with mild attitude, then this is where you want to go.  \n\nIt's a small menu.  Everything's pretty much fried.  Try the mushrooms, they're good.
