ermaghad.\n\nI only did this because our friend wanted it for his birthday. \n \nBackground:  I do not like scary things.  I saw \"Amityville Horror\" (the original version) when I was a wee little girl and it freaked me the heck out.  Ever since then, I avoid scary movies.  I've never seen \"The Omen\" or \"The Exorcist\" or \"The Shining.\"  So, of course the said friend chooses the room called \"Atelophobia\" for our group of 8 to do.  Ugh.  I'm not going to give it all away, but I will say that there's a part of the experience where four different people in the group have to go into another room by themselves in the dark.  Thank goodness one of those people wasn't me.\nEven though several of us were freaked out, we still had a fun time.  That doesn't mean I'll be doing it again any time soon, but you should try it with your friends or family at least once; it's a totally different and exhilarating way to spend an hour (or less if you're really good) with your squad.
