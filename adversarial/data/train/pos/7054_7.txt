I fell in love with this place from the first bite of food. I do not eat meat and they have a wide variety of veggie dishes. Everything tasted fresh and amazing!  The naan was soft, warm and freshly made. \nThe rice tasted so similar to the Persian rice I am used to so I devoured that LARGE and do I mean LARGE serving they prepare for you. \nOrdering over the phone for pickup is a little difficult because of the language barrier, but it is well worth the food. \nI have never sat down to eat so I do not know about waiter service. The place seemed clean, and they have a tV to watch when you are patiently waiting for your order to be ready!
