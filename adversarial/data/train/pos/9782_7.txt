This place is exquisite. If it were anywhere in the CA Bay Area people would be beating down the doors to eat here.\n\nNo, this is not your traditional Japanese place, and I'd like to think Ive had a lot of authentic Japanese cuisine.  But I would be stupid to compare Sushi-Ko to a \"traditional\" place.    (This is a response to the disgruntled reviewer below who was looking for yakisoba and gyoza... HELLO- did you try ANY of their fabulous rolls?? oops....sorry, I think I inadvertently called you stupid. ) \n\nSushi Ko is great in that its food is completely NOT traditional.  Its edgy, new, and enlightens my tastebuds.   \n\nA lot of similar nouveau places in California (Ive mentioned this in an another review) TRY to do this, but the execution is poor and sloppy -- as in they just slather rolls with mayo+sriracha and charge you 14 bucks.  This is NOT how Sushi Ko does it. Their sauces are unlike anything Ive tried and the combinations of flavors are delightful.\n\nAnd the fish freshness on west coast standards was excellent. \n\nI know its a bit of a trudge from the strip, but if you are anywhere out there, go to Sushi Ko. Ask what kind of rolls they recommend.  \nIt will be good.
