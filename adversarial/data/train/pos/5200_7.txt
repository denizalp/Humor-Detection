Just got back from Vegas again (4 clubs in 3 days!), and this place is STILL my favorite club on the strip. \n\nWhy Drai's is my fave:\n- There is not a single bad spot in the house. You can see the DJ from anywhere in the entire club.\n- The effects are BOMB. I've been to XS, Drai's, LiFE, Marquee, Light, Hakksan, Haze, and Tao, and Drai's still wins for best production effects- panoramic jumbotrons, cold air, confetti blasts, lasers, dancers, and lights in gluttonous abundance... they make the bass drops feel like the best day of your life!\n- \"The Hangover\" view kills me. No club in Vegas has an outdoor view like this one. \n- Bathrooms when you're drunk? Oh, I can still find them from a 10-foot electric sign that says \"RESTROOMS\"\n- Girl perk- EVERYONE can take the elevator like a normal human being, whether you're with a table or general admission! I despise Marquee because I remember climbing and descending six flights of stairs in heels in a back-alley looking stairwell more than I remember what the actual club looked like. \n- Bartenders? There's one with a little too much surgical work that still looks really angry at the world, but she'll still give you a drink. (Don't forget to tip)\n\n****For mostly girl groups: Go through the promo manager Mike to get in for free (702.883.9549). This is my second time working with him, and I think I love Drai's extra because of the extra mile he takes to actually make me feel like I'm actually VIP at a club, even when I'm a nobody :P :P :P \n\nLastly, check the calendar again to make sure you like the performance that night- they have open format days, EDM guests, hip hop guests, etc. As long as you love the  music for the night you chose, you will probably consider this your favorite clubbing experience in Vegas.
