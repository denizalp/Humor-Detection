We just recently moved out of these apartments and it was the best thing we ever did.  During our year of living in this lovely place we encountered tons of roaches, mold, and broken, run down equipment. Not to mention the management. They were the biggest jerks we have ever had to deal with. They never fixed our things in a timely matter nor did they care too. Very rude and ugly people.
