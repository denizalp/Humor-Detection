Great sandwiches. Generous portions. Clean. Great customer service.\n\nI took a sandwich home from here tonight. I had a chicken sandwich with marinara and cheese. I was expecting slices of grilled chicken breast, but it turned out to be shredded chicken. I didn't get to eat it until about an hour and a half or so after they handed it to me, but it was still totally delicious. I pretty much expected the bread to be a soggy marinara mess, but it wasn't at all. The bread they use is awesome. I had the soft french bread. Overall, the sandwich was REALLY good - especially considering how long it sat in the bag before I devoured it.\n\nThe owner and staff were super nice and friendly. The place was very clean as well. It's set up sort of like a Quiznos, but it's clear the quality of ingredients used here is far superior. They will pretty much make you any sort of sandwich you can dream up. Their menu online has 150 sandwiches on it plus a build your own. \n\nLooks like this restaurant is going to be a new local chain - I'm told they plan to open more locations. There are a few other choices for sandwiches at this intersection, but having tried the other places, I can safely declare this the best option. \n\nWhile I was waiting for my food, a guy came in and said he's been to sandwich places all over the East coast (and listed some States known for solid sandwich shops) and that this was the best sandwich he's ever had. I mean, if I was a real professional culinary critic, I would have been suspicious that they paid him to come in and say all that stuff. But I'm not and it was legit. I don't know if it was the best I've ever had, but it was definitely good enough to make me want to go back. \n\nOh, and they deliver if you live or work nearby, so that's awesome.
