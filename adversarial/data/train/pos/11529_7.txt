I love that the traditional shopping mall has evolved into spaces like this. The outdoor shopping center is particularly great in towns like Las Vegas since we have beautiful weather most days of the year. Who wants to be inside on a nice day?\n\nThe shopping center has lots of parking, part indoor parking garages and part outdoor parking. I'm sure most people like garages, especially on hot days, but I love the outdoor parking. Outdoor parking in my opinion makes it easy for me to quickly pop in here on a lunch break. Lunches are when I spend the most time here so this is important to me.\n\nThe parking lots and sidewalks are well maintained and clean. There are plenty of trees and green to make the shopping center aesthetically pleasing. \n\nI like pretty much all of the restaurants here. Most are chains, but they are higher quality chains if you will. My favorites here are Texas de Brazil and Kabuki. Great local restaurants and may favorites overall here are Crazy Pita and Pot Liquor. They also have some quick options like Capriotti's or the prepared food area at Whole Foods.\n\nThe store selection is pretty solid. They have most of the standard shopping center basics like Victoria Secret, Bath & Body Works, H&M, and Charming Charlie's. None of those are the reason I come here, but I know most people like those stores. My favorites are the stores that aren't at all shopping centers like the Container Store, Paper Source, Teavana, and Whole Foods. The Whole Foods here rocks too.\n\nSometimes I come here for lunch, sometimes I come to get something I need, and sometimes just to walk around and enjoy the sunshine.
