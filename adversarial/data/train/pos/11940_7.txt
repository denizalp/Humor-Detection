This place has a cool concept and would be really great if they taught their employees how to actually prepare and handle coffee.\n\nI learned about his location thru Uber Eats, because they were a featured vendor. So i was curious to try them out in person. The decor, wall mural and comfortable lounge seating all make for an inviting ambience. \n\nThe menu has a variety of signiture drinks and small assortment of cafe food, unfortunately no vegan food options. When I asked the \"Barista\" if they had any nondairy milk options she said \"I have almond milk.\" I said \"Do you have anything else, lile maybe soy?\" She said \"I have almond.\" Fine. I sit down and wait for my parties drinks to arrive, when I see a huge sign saying their milk alternatives. Cashew, soy and almond. Clearly ahe was too bothered and just wanted to make the drink quickly.\n\nMy party and I waiting 20 mins before asking where our drinks were. As if the barista forgot she said \"Ohh yeah!!\" And made them quickly. What was ordered was a nutella iced latte woth almond milk and a signiture Illumilatte with almond milk. As soon as we tasted our drinks myself and my party commented on how watered down and sugary they were.\n\nAs our lattes sat there they separetes into sugar on one end and milk on the other. Where the coffee was... I dont know! Lol very unremarkable and unimpressive. Dishes from other patrons food were left around and not cleaned up. If I wanted a sugar drink I would order that. But if I go to a coffee shop, I would expect .....I dont know.... coffee! Lol no thanks Illumilatte.
