I know a lot of people are practically rolling their eyes when another brewery pops up in this city. But I'm SO glad this one is here.\n\nThe staff are engaging and very attentive. I've always been welcomed as soon as I grab a seat. There's plenty of room inside and if you're looking for a space for a private event, it's definitely worth a look. I had my bridal shower here and everyone loved it! (Contact Debbie for reservations)\n\nThere's a patio outside where pups are allowed (since they can have food ordered in, no animals are allowed inside). There are plenty of tables and chairs, plus a set of cornhole boards out there. For indoor games, there's actually an Escape Room in the front corner, an arcade game and a selection of board games in the middle area that you can take to whatever table you like. \n\nYou can bring in food or have it ordered in from different places. They always have menus for you to check out (Olde Pineville Premium Pub and Libretto's come immediately to mind, but there are more.) On Fridays, they order in complimentary apps from local restaurants from 5 pm to 7 pm (places vary) and there's music bingo with Alan. I think it starts at 8, but it might be 7. Check it out on their page to verify. He has music from all genres, so it's a fun time! \n\nAs far as the beers go, I've settled on my favorite and that's what I've been having for the past couple weeks. I know I need to branch out again, but I'm stuck on the Red Maembe. It's got a great mango nose, but the flavor doesn't overpower at all. It's a delicious balance. The Husband really loves the Sweet Memories, so that's his go-to. I do remember really liking the Ghosts of Pumpkins Past when I had it. And they have a Saison that I enjoy as well.\n\nThree Spirits is really a fantastic hang with some great beer options available. If you're in the area, you should totally bookmark it and come through! Oh! They are now open on Sundays from 1-6, too!
