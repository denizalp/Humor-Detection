Smoothie places in Vegas are few and far between, and the few that are in between make more of an iced down fruitish flavored substance. I'm talking to you, Tropical Smoothie.\n\nI went into Berry Blendz expecting very little, but was pleasantly surprised by the friendly environment and infinite amount of smoothie flavors available. Plus I think you can create your own! Nothin' I like more than being in control. Hey, I AM a woman afterall. Seriously though, the selection was fantastic and neatly organized into subcategories, a huge plus for those with OCD tendencies. Every fruit in its place! \n\nSo far I've tried a few smoothies from the \"berry\" section, figured I'd stick to their namesake. Every smoothie has been delicious and the perfect smoothie consistency. IE SMOOTH and not icy. My boyfriend got the peanut butter & jelly smoothie and I ended up sucking down most of that one, too. It's just as good as a peanut butter & jelly sandwich that spent all day being perfectly smooshed beneath a cold juice box.\n\nThis place also sends coupons to your phone if you text a certain number! I spend my nights waiting by the phone hoping for a text from Berry.
