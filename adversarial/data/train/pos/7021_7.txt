Had some smoothies this morning (the ingredients are pre-packaged for easily assembly - not something I was expecting to learn), and they were out of vegetables to add to the smoothies.\n\nOf the fresh made smoothies, one had an overwhelming amount of ginger that overpowered all the other ingredients and was unpleasant to drink. Threw that one out. \n\nThe other, which was was almond milk\/cocoa\/datey was much better tasting but there was some hard sediment in it which you couldn't bite through and had to spit out. \n\nOverall, I wont be going back...but then again I'm not the kind of person who thinks it is wise to spend $69 per day on juice cleanses (actual retail price!). They do make really great accessories for Instagram pictures, though! Bon appetit !!
