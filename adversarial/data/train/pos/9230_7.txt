My wife and I came in between 630p-645p on Wednesday, 12\/23\/15.  The place was not busy at all, maybe about 10 total tables sat with a few people at the bar. We were data immediately and received our menus and told a server would be right with us. We were sat at a table right next to the bar.  10 minutes later, no one had shown up yet to greet us or take our drink order. We flagged down one of the 2 girls running the host\/hostess table at the entrance and let her know that our server had not been by yet. She apologized and said she would send someone over. We then watched another table get sat 2 tables away, have a server come to them first, take their drink order, receive their drinks and not once did anyone come by our table. \n\nWe decided to get up and leave at this point. Best part is what happens next. As we begin to walk out, 2 guys who were cleaning the tables came to our table and cleaned up the menus and our build a burger orders that we have prepared within 30 seconds of us standing up and leaving the table. Also, as we are leaving the 2 girls at the front were just standing laughing, having a fun time on their phones giggling and laughing.  They both told good-bye and have a great night. My wife then responded back \"No one ever came to take our order!\"\n\nWe went down the street to ReHab Burger. Was greeted immediately and sat at a table. Server came within 1 minute and we had drinks on the table within 3 minutes.  If you actually want to drink \"cold beer\" and eat \"cheeseburgers\", I would go to ReHab instead.
