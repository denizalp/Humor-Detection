If you want a little bit of a different type of menu, with a younger sexy crowd, check this place out. I like coming here for just drinks and appetizers with friends. \n\nThey serve special cocktails ie Fresh Pomegranate and Blueberry Martinis. \n\nGreat Appetizers: \n-Beef Carpaccio \n-Calamari \n-Boston Bibb Salad \n-Portobello Flatbread \n\nFav Entrees: \n-Pork Medallions \n-Duck \n\nBest Drink:\n-Blueberry Martini\n\nThey don't get the fifth star ONLY because if you said we were going here for dinner, I wouldn't Oh Girlfriend you.
