We've been here several years ago, and the first thing we notice are the torn and worn chairs. This is indicative of all at Sky Ranch, a place that appears to be in a dire need of updating. The only thing that has been updated are the prices, which seem punitive for what you receive. \n\nSalt. Salt seems to be used to mask rubbery flank steak and boned riddled salmon with a sad side of mashed potatoes. Please don't look at the chicken covered with American processed cheese slices and ham taken out of a Junior High school cafeteria. \n\nWhy does Sky Ranch disrespect its food and its customers by handing out day old bread from bags and forcing them to sit on worn out furniture? Perhaps this is why, in a Saturday night, empty tables littered the small place.\n\nThe saving grace was the three piece band and beautiful salsa and other melodies which got everyone dancing. This earned the second star. If you do go, please order plenty of water and drink even more when you go home and the sodium will overflow your internal organs through the next morning.\n\n-RZ
