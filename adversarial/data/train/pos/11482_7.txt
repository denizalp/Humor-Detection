It was restaurant week so we got booted to the outside at 5pm, which I think my cousin got bit by a scorpion something, which I'm so glad my baby didn't. Her skin puffed up. It was really bad..\n\nTo the food...(happy hour by the way too)\nThe food is that asian\/mexican fusion with tacos, etc that just didn't impress me because it's become the norm. My stomach starting hurting afterwards and I had to drink a lot of water. Overall, I just wasn't wowed and my cousin landed in the urgent care = deal breaker
