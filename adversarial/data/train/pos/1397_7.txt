Thank you Pittsburgh Popcorn Company! You made my day!  I am having my baby shower this weekend and the party favors are going to be fantastic! That's right I am 7 months pregnant! \n\nI was doing a ton of research trying to find something perfect to give my guests. I am not a junk person and most shower favors are just that. Plastic baby this or that, tiny soaps in pink carriages blah!! So I started looking at the Pittsburgh Popcorn Company website. I wanted to do something Pittsburgh since I love what my city has to offer and my guests are mostly from the Erie area. They offer so many amazing flavors, large tins, sample bags, even bulk for weddings or larger events. I wanted to keep it less expensive so I formulated my own favor bags. I am organizing three types of popcorn to sample for my friends to take home, chocolate peanut butter, cinnamon toast\/cheddar mix, and spicy chipotle. \n\nI love that they post their flavor menu for the month so you can go in and try all the inventive flavors they come up with. I went down to the strip twice before I purchased to ask questions, and taste what I wanted. Sometimes you go in and they are slammed so you want to go on a weekday afternoon if you want to linger about. Even on the busy days I was there the staff was friendly and informative. I asked how long the popcorn lasted because obviously you want to have the freshest and if sealed should last about a month. I ended up waiting until closer to the shower date to make my favors but I am very OCD and wanted it to be perfect! Since I am doing a smaller sampler I ended up purchasing the small bags with the logo then printed my own Thank you logo for the brown vintage looking bags. I couldn't be happier! They look so cute and they go with the theme of my shower. I'm sure my guests will be licking their lips and truly enjoying the favors!!
