This place suceeds in spite of itself. \n\nIt has a great location, and an appealing look. I wish I could say the same about the food. I agree with Jamie P's review; the food is not quality. \n\nIf you're in the mood for this type of food, and don't feel like driving 90 miles to the nearest Chic Fil A, then settle for Raising Caine. You'll at least get hot food, quality fries, and a friendly attitude. \n\nI am done with this; one and out.
