Cheap, Cheap, Cheap. I got a fill for $11.99. I think they filled my gels with acrylics, but at that price I really didn't care. My biggest pet peeve when it comes to nail is when they pile them on to thick and you have 4 pound weights on each finger when you leave. This was not the case at all here, they were thin and they looked decent afterwards. \n\nI wouldn't recommend this place if you are looking for some serious pampering, as it is a bit run down. But if you are looking for a quick fill or cheap mani\/pedi Seatop isn't bad.
