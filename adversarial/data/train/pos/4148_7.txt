You know, I was very, very pleasantly surprised by how simple and painless it was to cancel my membership at GoodLife (although time will tell a few months ago; I'll have to keep an eye on my bank balance to make sure that they don't keep debiting me like some gyms - http:\/\/www.yelp.ca\/biz\/fitness-one-toronto-4#hrid:jGlnWI18SSNqzEopICe_ZQ - are notorious for doing). Gym manager \"Marissa\" was professional and got straight to the point as we filled out the paperwork together. \n\nShe wished me a happy move and good luck with my future fitness goals, which I thought was nice and responsible of her. She didn't question my decision to cancel or try to convince or swindle me into staying. Goodbye, GoodLife. It's been a pleasure paying for\/not using your services this past year.
