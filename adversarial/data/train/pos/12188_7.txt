Princess Center dentistry does a great job. I'm always in and out very quickly.  The staff is very nice and personable. Upon returning for a check up, they remembered me and made going to the dentist not as gloomy and sad as it usually is, thanks to their personable dialogue and general excited approach.\nDr. Lew is very professional and straight forward by explaining everything that is going to be done. At PCD you won't have to worry about hidden fees or extra charges popping up when you check out. You'll know exactly what your paying for and why before you get the work done.\nI highly recommend Princess Center Dentistry.
