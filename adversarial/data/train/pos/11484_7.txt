Rhino was the only service I could find that could come out with 48 hours notice prior to some family spending the weekend at my house, so I went with them out of necessity and otherwise good reviews. The two women they sent showed up during the 30 minute window I was given and stayed for about the 4 hours I was quoted. Other than the two of them somehow spending a whole hour in one bathroom which wasn't that dirty, I don't have any other real complaints. I suppose tying my tissue boxes into bows is a nice touch, but not if it's at the expense of being more thorough in other areas. This would be a solid 4 star review if not for the fact I was charged an additional fee just to pay by card as they were leaving my house. This was never disclosed up front and as far as I know is against most merchant agreements with credit card networks to pull this nonsense on their customers. It's 2018 - nobody writes checks anymore. Dinging me a convenience fee when I'm already paying over $200 for a service results in me dinging back one star.
