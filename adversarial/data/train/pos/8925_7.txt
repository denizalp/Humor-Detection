The service is so horrendous it's laughable. The food is mediocre at best. Came in with a party of 7. The place was busy, but not insane. I ordered a skinny margarita. Not bad. After I got my drink I had decent expectations. Table got guac and chips. Not very good albeit expensive. My chicken quesadilla was greasy and tasted like canned chicken. My boyfriend got fish tacos, and they were a little better, but bland. \nOur server was basically non-existent. My friend had to ask three different ppl for a lemon for her water. The food runner brought her some, after a ridiculous wait for our food. We would have ordered more cocktails, however we didn't get the opportunity to. \nDon't even bother. This is Vegas. There are much better restaurants. My wallet hurts from the price gouge.
