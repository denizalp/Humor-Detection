Yelp is real reviews by real people. This real person is a fan of coffee. When it is hot! A slight dilemma at this Starbucks was that the coffee was not hot. After they brewed new coffee, it still wasn't hot. By the time of the refill the coffee was hot. \n\n  Despite the fact that the first two cups of coffee were not hot, this is a charming Starbucks. It is in a part of Las Vegas that isn't hyper busy. Because the shopping center it anchors is small it is not challenging to find a parking space. Without a drive thru and featuring soft lighting, this is a cozy Starbucks. It looks like it was remodeled with an emphases on comfort. The baristas are personable and fast. An example of friendly service is when the barista let a customer use their phone.\n\n   A closing time of 7 p.m., seems kind of early on a Saturday. But it makes business sense considering this Starbucks does most of its business in the morning (this is what the barista told the customer).\n\n  This real person could return to this Starbucks if he is in the area. Most likely it will be for an ice blended beverage.
