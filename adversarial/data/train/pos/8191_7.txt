Sorry, Fresh is maybe my least favourite restaurant in the city.\n\nIt is way way too expensive for a place that sells bowls of rice. Also, if you are going to sell bowls of rice, they should be full of flavour. Be warned: the menu at Fresh lists every single ingredient in the dish. So if you order a rice bowl with zucchini, sun-dried tomatoes, and portabello mushrooms, that is exactly what you're going to get. No sauce! Though you can get a side of their miso gravy (this is actually pretty good, but I love good-tasting nutritional yeast, which is, I'm pretty sure, all it is.)\n\nAlso, really, if you are feeling like something \"healthy\" stay home to eat! There are many nice ways to socialize that don't feature alienating your friends by forcing them to eat a bowl of virtue for dinner just because you don't want dairy, or meat, or anything delicious.\n\nAlso, vegetarians! Stand up for yourselves! You deserve good food too!
