They're stuck up and won't let you in! Got there at 10:30 and waited in the general admission line with 3 girls. Got to the front of the line and that's when the bouncer started with his B.S. about the place getting packed, and that the only way to get in now is to get a table. The place was NOT packed first of all, it was barely 11pm.\n\nI really hope this place burns in hell, and goes bankrupt. The bouncers are a-holes.\n\nNote:\nThere's cover also, $10 for girls and $15 for guys which I was willing to pay.
