This was my first go at an escape room, and the only reason I can sort of compare it to other escape rooms in Toronto is because my 3 companions are what I would call vets of the Escape Room scene and all 3 of them were filled with high praise at how good Perplexity was in terms of difficulty and the effort they put in to the props etc. \n\nThey have 5 rooms I believe, and we opted to check out 2, 1 of them being recommended for a group of 8 the other a group of 4. Since we were only 4 strong, we figured the bigger room would be a challenge, which it really did end up being but we managed to beat it with less than a minute to spare, which was pretty epic and we managed to impress the staff as well, so go us! The room for 4 was easier, we might have gotten stuck at the very start wrapping our heads around stuff, which probably cost us the chance to finish this room in record time. And that leads me to another fun fact about this place, is that at the entrance they have listed the record times for each room, so it's extra motivation for us to try and beat that! Just imagine all that bragging rights we would have! \n\nThe only spot of bother I had with this location was that it was around $50 for the 4 of us, but (and I might be wrong here) it would have been cheaper if we were able to spread the cost if we had a bigger group. But like I said, it's such a minor thing and the fun rewards we got back from coming here was well worth the cost. \n\nBooking was generally harmless, but always call ahead (as is the rule with almost all room escapes). The staff here were really friendly and enthusiastic, full props to them. I would definitely like to come back here to check out their remaining rooms.
