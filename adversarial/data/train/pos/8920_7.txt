We wanted to try an establishment in Chandler, and was fooled by the word 'speakeasy' in the name. I have been to a few speakeasy places and always enjoyed them, thus a speakeasy saloon was different and a little exciting. All excitement was gone one I walked through those doors, when an atmosphere atmosphere of depression and melancholy embraces me like a brain parasite. \n\nThe Good. \nWell, it was easy to find and there was lots of room due to lack of patrons. \nThat's all I can muster up.\n\nThe Bad.\nThe Service is fantastically bad. The waitress we had was rough looking, and when I mean rough I mean Gulag-style kind of rough and the style of waiting followed suit. All of us felt she was hostile and passive aggressive. Even when someone tried to order from the bar, the bartender ignored them (probably so they had to use their hostile waitress) over and over. \nThe service alone would have given this place a bad review.. but wait, there's more. \n\nThe Absolutely Ridiculously Bad. \nHair in the food of two dishes. A hefeweisen that looked like it was part milk, part water from the holy river of Ganges. Do NOT buy draft beers for two reasons; 1) they apparently don't treat their equipment and 2 ) then you need to use their glasses. They must have a broken dishwasher, because we had wineglasses that came out with lipstick stains, water glasses that came out just filthy. I am getting sick to my stomach in retrospective knowing that I actually ate some stuff here. \n\nSummary.\nDISGUSTING. This place is NOT a steak house, and NOT a speakeasy. Bad service. Horrible hygiene. Well overpriced food, that also is questionable if one would dare to eat it. This place have done everything wrong. I wouldn't come back here even if I got a whole night comped. Disgusting place that I hope closes down as soon as possible.
