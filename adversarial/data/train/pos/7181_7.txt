Every Sunday there is a giant drum circle, with dancing hippies and dozens of craft vendors.  The park is huge, but this event, called the Tam Tams (English translation: drum drums, basically), takes place right off Parc avenue cross street Rachel (Rachel doesn't cross Parc at this point, but if it did, it would hit the Tams).  Look for a big monument with a winged angel on the top, and you're there.  You can take the 80 bus from downtown, or you can jump on a BIXI and ride there.  There are two BIXI stands near the Tams, one directly across the street and another at Parc and Mont Royal.  They are often full, but they turn quickly, so just wait it out.  You can get a free 15 minutes if the stand is full, just poke the dispenser machine.\n\nThe Tams are amazing, and very family friendly, too.  There are dogs, hippies, girls in bikinis, young people, old people, Rastas, acrobats, jugglers.\n\nNear the Tams, but further in, away from the road, something absolutely bug-nuts awesome happens.  People gather on a dirt battle field and wallop each other with medieval weapons covered in foam.  Some of them are dressed in pretty impressive battle armor.  They take it very serious, and oh man is it a great thing to watch.  If you've never seen this go down, check it out for sure.\n\nSo, Sunday on the mountain.  There's no place I'd rather be, full stop.
