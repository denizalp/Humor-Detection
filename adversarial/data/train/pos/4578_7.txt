Seems like more and more people are crossing over to a vegan lifestyle. Who knows if it's the right or wrong thing to do. But I do know it's trending and I'm all about pleasing the palate. I decided to venture to this Vegan style burger joint. Yes I said it burger joint LOL.\n\nNow let's be clear there is not one animal product in this establishment so no real beef, chicken or cheese here folks! I started with fried Avocado's that's was different.  There was enough for three people to share. I opted for the grilled chicken sandwich as it seemed like the healthier option in my head. I paired it with good ole American fries.  The meal was delicious overall despite being vegan. Did my chicken taste like chicken? For the most part it did. I'm not going to question how they achieved this flavor.  Nonetheless I was full after the experience surprisingly, I had no room for dessert.  This is a cute little spot located in downtown Toronto. Trendy and hipster. Cool place for brunch! They serve a variety of wine and alcohol. I'm assuming all beverages are vegan as well. Ps no salads. Think burger joint with no beef. Yes they serve milk shakes!
