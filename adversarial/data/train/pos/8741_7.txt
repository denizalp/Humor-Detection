Made two separate attempts to talk to the management about the offensive nature of the \"Ghetto Chicken\" they regularly advertise on their sidewalk chalkboard....was rudely blown off by staff both times.\nWhen I asked for a manager, on both occasions, I was asked \"Why\".  When I replied that I had a complaint, I was told that there was no manager present, and they refused to give me email or phone contact info for management.\n\nThey can keep their sign.....and I will keep my business for more enlightened venues.
