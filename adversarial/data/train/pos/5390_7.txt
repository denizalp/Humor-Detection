This is not the worst place that you could go. Maybe not the best for sure. But, they do have good breakfast. The staff works very hard here. You have to give them points for that.\nThe price is low, so no complaining there. Endless coffee another plus.\nNot a bad place we would go back for sure. I have only had the Breakfast there and I like it. Plus, it is a chain. Besides it is 24 hours a day so that is another nice thing.
