Kareys Kitchen...a new takeout fusion restaurant near me in PHX..yay~! I attended the soft opening and got to sample all of the filipino\/mexican fusion tasties! The family is so friendly that you leave Kareys feeling all warm inside.., whether from the food or the family, and your wallet not too hit! \nCassava cake is the bomb..even though Im not to into sweets.. \nA bit hard to see from the street ..next to Blockbuster on 40th.. look for it..its worth it:-)
