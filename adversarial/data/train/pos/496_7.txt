I used to like this place, until this evening. My experience today has turned me off them completely. I refuse to patronise this establishment ever again, and if I could somehow find an email address for the place I would express my frustration with them.\n\nI believe I was subjected to the Asian version of racism against white people. I was having a lovely dinner with a friend. We were merrily frying our meat on the grill. Behind my friend was a rather boisterous party of young asian kids (I think they were korean, but who knows). Generally I don't mind exuberance. But these kids were so loud I couldn't hear my friend when he yelled something at me across the grill.\n\nWe had asked our server if he could have a word with the party. He stared at us blankly, did a half shrug\/half nod and wandered away. Not once did he approach the party to ask them to tone it down a little, so that we could actually have an enjoyable meal.\n\nAt the cash register we asked the server why he did not speak to the young party. The excuse we got was \"they are young\". When asked why he's using that excuse, again with the half shrug\/half nod. When asked if I could speak to a manager I got a blank look & a mumbled comment that there was no manager on site at the time.\n\nIf you are prepared to be discriminated against by a bunch of rude waiters this is the place for you. For me, I refuse to go there again.
