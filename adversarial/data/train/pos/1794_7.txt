OK??? \nNo offense, but anyone who gives this place a 5 stars is on something.  Not onto something... on something.  Whatever you wanna call it, meth, speed, crank, ice, rock.  Must be some good ish. Or you've never had italian food before in which this will do.\n\nThis place sucks on so many levels I cant even write a full review without getting turrets. \"Ahh F' u suck Carrabba's! ahh\" \n\nOK I'll try...\n\nMy first nightmare at the Henderson Carrabba's was terrible.  Cold food, bad service. I didn't leave a tip.  Terrible experience.\n\nBut my GF wanted to try it one day, so the second nightmare began when I went to eat at this \"restaurant\" and my date and I decided to eat outdoors.  This was obviously a problem cause we got NO SERVICE AT ALL. I had to walk in and remind them that we were there. WOW. OK so besides this, it's all about the food, right? I order the lasagna and about an hour later when we finally get our food after three or four bread baskets, the lasagna comes out... I begin to eat, biting into the lasagna.  This ish was hard as a rock.  Burnt to a crisp.  Crazy right? After all that time you'd think they'd try to get it right.  They comped the meal, but of course they should have. Ridiculous (not in a good way)... My GF's meal was gross too and we left w\/out eating anything. \n\nI mean, is there a no stars? \n\nCLIFFNOTES: DO NOT GO TO THIS RESTAURANT!!! \n\nPS: I can't wait til it shuts down.\n(I had to reedit this and take out all the curse words.)
