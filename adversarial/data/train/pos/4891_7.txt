Food and strippers in the same place? He'll yeah... Jk on the strippers. But hey if you like that no judgement haha. Anyways I've been wanting to try this place for a really long time so finally today on a very random night we decided to go. And well because there wasn't many places open that late. We were greeted by a man at the door who gave us the option to sit at a table or the bar since they had happy hour going on. We didn't want to drink so we sat in a table. Right away he brought us chips and salsa which we enjoyed a little too much as they were gone before our food came out. Huge mistake because I was so stuff by then. I usually don't like to eat meat, but because this place is organic and GMO free I was perfectly okay with it. I had the street tacos. 1 alpastor, 1 cochinita and 1 rajas. All accompany by rice and beans. I loved the tacos! The cochinita had purple onions with habanero omg really good kick. The alpastor were good and sweet from the pineapple. The rajas were okay. My boyfriend had their carne Asada plate and he loved it! I tried a piece of it and it really was delicious. To finish off we had their flan. Ohhhmmgeeeee it was so bomb! So rich and creamy at the same time. Our server was named Charles and he was amazing! Really nice and was on top of everything. Over all I had zero complaints about this whole place. Definitely coming back next week, and I am bringing the parentals.
