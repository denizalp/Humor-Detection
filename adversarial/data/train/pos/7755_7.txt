OMG!!! My husband wanted calzone & I wanted pizza, so I wanted to rely on my Yelp family & decided on Frankie's Pizza. \n\nGreeted by Kristy who had a big smile the moment we opened the door.\n\nHusband ordered Calzone $7.99 (+$3) w\/pep, sausage & pepper. He said it was the best calzone he has ever had, I'm not a calzone fan but when I tasted it, I'm hooked.\n\nI ordered lunch pizza $5.99 pep & pep w\/sausage & onion. This is THE pizza place.\n\nFamily owned business Frankie (brother) makes the pizza (off course learned from his papa), Mom makes everything homemade (I can't wait to try).\n\nWe will definitely return to Frankie's not only was the food delicious the service was incredible.\n\nKristy you are my new BFF! Ladies did I mention Frankie is HOT \n\nThank you Yelp family for your recommendation.
