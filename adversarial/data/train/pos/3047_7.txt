AWFUL. Truly awful.\n\nWe booked a \"World Class\" suite. Based on pictures on their site we thought our $500 (plus $39\/night resort fee, so more like $560) for 2 nights would at least get us a posh stay.\nWRONG!!!!!\nWe walked into a room the size of a college dorm! Literally, probably smaller. The two 'full' beds looked like twin beds, the carpet was literally utilitarian (like in an office building), everything was stark and dark. . So to offset that, they had huge mirrors on EVERY wall, some lighted. It actually made us MORE claustrophobic. Ceilings were VERY low, to add to the stifling feeling. NO surfaces to place anything at ALL, nor room to unpack or put things. Hugely un-functional (the only 'huge' thing about it, lol).\n\nWhen I called management, they offered to upgrade us for $80\/night MORE. Other than that it was sorry- charlie. Greg at front desk was argumentative and unhelpful. THANKFULLY he reminded me I'd booked through Travelocity, so I called them and they fully refunded so that we could GET OUT OF THERE and go stay at Alexis Suites. Alexis has a kitchen, front room and bedroom, separated by a door! So spacious!\n\nOh, and BTW, it's NOT A NEW HOTEL as I'd heard. It's not even really renovated as far as I can tell. It's just the Sahara redecorated (and the room smelled old\/musty). When I complained about the size of the room, the bellhop said \"Well there's not much you can do with a 70 year old building.\"  Umm, how about knock the wall down between the rabbit hutch sized rooms to make  a bigger room! And don't pass the hotel off as NEW!!
