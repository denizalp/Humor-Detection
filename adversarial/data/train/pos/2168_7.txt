Honestly, this is getting 4 stars for ONE reason, the dill pickle popcorn. O M G! That was sooooo good. I could eat like 5 containers. (Dont judge me!)\nI'm not a beer person, so although they have tons of beers on tap, it's just not my kinda place. The beer flights are cute, served on a wooden serving tray, but again, I dont enjoy beer. I wonder if they have lambic; that I like.\nAnyway, my friends like this place, so I know I'll be back...and then I'll get to have more dill pickle popcorn....YAY!
