I typically have avoided Chinese buffets after finding most are unappetizing and not well stocked.  So I never paid any mind to TJs either.  I was really missing out!\n\nI've only been here for lunch when they are busy, which is the best time to eat buffet style food so everything is fresh.\n\nIncredibly, this is by far the best Chinese food in the area and it is half the price too.  The sheer volume and variety of food they offer is pretty amazing.  In addition to the standards you'll find at any Chinese restaurant, they also have french fries, chicken wings, soups, and whole baked salmon.  \n\nThere are a half dozen serving stations and each has 10-12 items.  The steamed rice is served from the steamer with a lid, so there are no crusty dried grains to avoid like other buffets have.\n\nThe sushi offerings are also good and have variety of at least 8 different rolls.  California roll and Philly roll are here, plus some adventurous ones as well.\n\nSave room for dessert too.  There are puddings, fruits, cookies, cupcakes, carrot cake, jello, and even ice cream!\n\nThis is a great place for kids.  Mine are picky eaters, and the wide variety along with all the dessert offerings always has them eating without a fuss and leaving satisfied.\n\nThe service is fast and friendly.  You don't wait to be seated, have your drink refilled or to pay.  That alone is better than most places I can think of.  The buffet is constantly being replenished too.\n\nIf you are in a hurry, it's faster, cheaper and better than the many fast food offerings nearby.  They even sell containers to go, by-the-pound.
