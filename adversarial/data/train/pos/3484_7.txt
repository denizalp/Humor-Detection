When I was in college, I loved Maloney's.  \nNow that I'm out (okay, waaay out) I hate it.\nWhy? Oh maybe because it's filled with underagers with fake id's and horny college guys that think humping you from behind is a form of dancing or because it just makes me feel old.\nSo this is my suggestion: if you're in college or just a bit older, definitely go to Maloney's- it's always packed, they play fun music and have great drink specials. If you're older and want to party with people your own age, go to Scottsdale.
