Pretty average in comparison to other locations I've visited. You walk in, you are greeted by the pastry box (wish I can have one of each!) then you view the sandwich, salad, soup and pasta menu ahead. \nI do wish the people working the registers were a bit more personable; no smile, no real welcome greeting. It's nice they offer the \"half sandwich, half salad or soup\" deal. \n\nI opted for the half sandwich and half salad plus an apple on the side. My sandwich was bomb, one of my all time favorites at Panera: Chipotle Chicken Avocado Press! This sammie is seriously bursting with flavor and then add some Tabasco, bam! It's pure perfection! My salad on the other hand, chicken lime, something something- was not that good. I thought it only had romaine lettuce but it had some kind of sour leafy green that really killed the dressing and over all taste. This mystery leafy green was super biter, not my cup of tea! \n\nOther than that, this Panera is clean, is full stocked with sauces and napkins and it's conveniently located of a super busy street.
