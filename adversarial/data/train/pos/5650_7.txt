So apparently they changed their menu, I'm not sure what the older menu looked like but the new one is limted. I decided to try this place becuase of the the yelp reviews and pictures. Well most of the items they no longer serve. The service was ok, the food was below average for bar food (see pics), lettuce was wilted and slimy on both the appetizer which was tuna poke wontons and entr√©e was seared ahi salad, the server asked if I'd like them to get me new lettuce which makes no sense if your getting the salad from the same bag of lettuce. So no thanks. We were still charged for everything, no manager came by, no apology nothing.
