This place is amazing! I've been dying to come here even since I found it on yelp but never had the time until now.  My husband was definitely way more excited then I was that it became hard to find him in the crowd.  They have amazing and unique drink specials!! My favorrrrriiiitttee was the slush puppies with some alcohol content inside!! It was like a taste of my younger years with a hint of adulthood.  They also have options for those designated drivers as well!  They unfortunately do not sell food which was kind of sad but then again I don't blame them.  It prevents people from putting their greasy salivated fingers away from the games.  Definitely recommend this place for anyone looking for a playful night!
