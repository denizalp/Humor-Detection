I came here due to a groupon deal and it was overall just not that great. The decor is very nice and elegant but not reflective of the quality of food. The stand out items were the chicken wings and tikka masala.  The naan bread was too firm and just not fresh. The price to food quality ratio is not worth going. The venue is designated to cater to tourists and casino guests.
