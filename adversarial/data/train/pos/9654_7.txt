Pudding wrestling!! I had to see how this would go down! A bunch of\nladies scantily clad slopping around in pudding. I thought it was gonna be trashy but the girls were pretty built and squirming tough! Quite an entertaining night I have to say.\n\nThe drinks are cheap, the line moved quickly, and it was packed full of all levels of hipsters. Super dirty ones and border line clean cut ones. The friends I went with were looking for love over Valentines day with the expectation that where there are ladies doused in pudding there would be lots of guys. Not sure if the guy I would want to start a meaningful relationship with is a pudding ogler but what an easy way to strike up a conversation.\n\nStanding in the back you can't see past the screaming crowd, standing in the front you are covered and splashed with yellow pudding. Tapioca? Lemon?  It was in my hair, purse, and all over my coat! Given the chance to choose I would totally be in the front row again. Had a blast!
