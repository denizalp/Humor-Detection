The last time I purchased a vehicle from the Findlay brand was in 1984.  i can honestly say that customer service must have gone out the window with that purchase!  I purchased an MKC, a luxury vehicle and did not even get so much as a thank you note!  I am in the sales field and always send a note of thanks for even the smallest sale even if it is via e-mail.  The last vehicle I purchased was for a Lexus 400RH (certified).  I not only got a very nice thank you, but also a birthday card and several follow up notes.  Great customer retention...no so with Findlay.  I am really disappointed with the entire buying process.  I could go on about a few other issues, however, the fact that I had to come back 3 times to sign papers before they would let me take the car was a laugh.   Additionally, the salesman seemed very insulted that I had shopped his price and other color choices and features.   From then on it was all down hill.
