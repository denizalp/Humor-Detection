HORRIBLE HORRIBLE HORRIBLE. The staff is clearly Miserable and burned out because those frowns and stressed attitudes can't be denied. They need some new blood in this particular location, long employment tenure does not mean good service. These postal workers are counting down their years to retire, unfortunately we the customers are at the receiving end in dealing with burned out employees :\/.
