Went for Breakfast and had the ham and cheese omelet. It was on the menu as an \"Insert Name I Forgot Here\" omelet which included peppers, but I'm not a fan so those were nixed. Everything needed ALOT of salt. I literally drowned the hash browns in salt just to give them some small semblance of flavor.\nBiscuits from the \"biscuits and gravy\" were all wrong and very dry. Wife had the breakfast burrito with one meat and 3 options. She liked it, but could only finish half. It was big and they do serve large portions, so go hungry, just don't expect anything above average as far as taste goes.\nBTW- I am someone who NEVER uses tobasco sauce (on anything), yet I found myself pouring it over the entire plate. You were warned.
