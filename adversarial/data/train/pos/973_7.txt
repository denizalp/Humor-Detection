One of the things this city is lacking is themed cafes. It's quite nice to be able to relax, enjoy a hot or cold drink and not be in a rush by choice while being in a different world - Hogwarts. Owl in a cage, Platform 9 3\/4, Quidditch, lightning bolt scar...espresso patronum!\n\nThere's a few reasons why I stopped going to chain coffee shops: they butcher my name (I mean it's not unique like LaQueefa), DBs in line who think they have more important things to do than you do, and the drinks are boring and there's not enough caffeine to wake up from the snooze fest.\n\nI prefer going here in the morning. There's always an empty table so, you can eat a quiche\/ cake\/ macaron\/ pastry\/ cookie\/ tart and drink your beverage. The morning crew are friendlier and they take the time to make sure they don't put stuff you are sensitive\/ allergic to in your drink. It's the little things like that that means a lot. Definitely great service! I've tried their quiche, strawberry tart, chocolate hazelnut cake, passion fruit jasmine tea, Nutella latte, and Nutella blended.\n\nThey also have butter beer latte, lavender, pistachio, Biscoff, matcha, etc. They sell shirts and tanks too. You pay for novelty...and for the afternoon crew to butcher your name in case you get a kick out of that.
