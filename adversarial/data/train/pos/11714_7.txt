This place was great. They were able to fix my phone right away, and it only took about 5 minutes. Then he showed me my phone and tested the functionality and realized the home button was no longer working. Because it was working when I brought it in, he fixed that too at no extra charge.\nVery friendly and thorough service. They have a 1 year warranty on the repair, and you can even upgrade the warranty so that if you break your phone again that's included!\nHighly recommend this place. I hope I don't have to go back, but if I ever break my phone, this is the guy.
