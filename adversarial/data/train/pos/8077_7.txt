Never really been impressed by this store's offerings. It's a step above Holt's utterly horrifying \"last chance\" store at Vaughan Mills. If you're in need of regular suiting, I'm sure this is a fine enough place. But if you're looking for some marquee brands at a great discount, move along. Move along.
