I went here last week with my Wifey. I'm a nice guy and damn good hubby, but painting potter \"just aint my thang\". Poor girl had to beg for months for this one.\n\nReally cool place. Not only can you paint pottery, but make soap, make candles, even decorate a dang cake. We went on a Sunday and it wasn't as busy as expected.\n\nThe staff was great. Very helpful and patient. They were even sweet enough to lie about the monstrosity of a coffee cup I painted and pass out a few compliments.\n\nSeriously guys... take your lady here. Grin and bare the humiliation and wallow in the sheer delight that is making your wife happy.\n\nOh, and take lots of pictures so you can remind her what a great guy you are.\n\nFYI - you are looking at about $10 or $15 bucks each for most of the pottery, then there is a $13 each price for using the facilities (for all the paint you waste, paint brushes, etc.). The whole thing was about $60 bucks. Kinda steep if you think of it as \"just two coffee cups\", but if you think of it as an experience, I was ok with it. Heads up though... they do offer tons of little things the call \"POP\", pretty much little decorations that cost extra. If you are letting a little kid run wild in here you may end up with a thousand dollar cake. My wife and I just painted coffee cups so what I thought I was going to pay was exactly what I paid. I like that. If you have kids, set limits... DUH.\n\nHave fun!!!
