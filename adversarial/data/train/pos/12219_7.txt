I am hesitant to write a review and tell everyone about this lovely place hahaha.  \n\nSmall space with approx 10 tables only...  Almost all tables are 4 person tables,  but can be pushed together if needed. I wouldn't recommend coming here with a large group... you may be waiting awhile for a table. \n\nFamily run with 3 locations across the city (the other locations are in royal oak and country hills). \n\nVery friendly service.  Lots of variety on the menu to try. ...  Best of all...  The majority of the customers were Indian!!!  That MUST mean that it's good!!  Quite busy so get there early or else you'll be waiting outside as there's not much of a foyer.  \n\nThey also offer take out (which I'm happy about).
