My wife loves to go shopping, and unfortunately I do not. This can cause quite a bit of tension in our relationship. From my perspective I really don't want to go, but she drags me along. Most of the time. \n\nBut when I've behaved really well she drops me off at Khoury's. What a blessing!  With their eleven draft handles and abundant bottle selection they have everything that a craft beer fan needs. \n\nMaybe I'll see you there. You'll most likely find me in the corner with a silly grin and poor social skills.
