I actually had really low expectations for this place but I was pleasantly surprised on how good it actually was. I didn't eat any of the meats however my son and Husband enjoyed the chicken, steak and salmon. The chicken was a little too charred but the inside was nice and cooked. As far as the salad bar I actually really enjoyed it, I got like 3 plates.  I really enjoyed the mashed potatoes, the tortilla soup,  the Asian pasta salad, the fresh fruits watermelon and cantaloupe they were super sweet! I also liked the salad and cubed cheese as well as the cheese bread. The corn and chick pea pasta was good too. I'm not a big meat person so it was nice to have options and good options. You can tell it tasted very fresh which I liked.\n\nThe service was good here. We came on a Saturday night so make sure you make reservations. They also have a girl come around and ask to take your picture and sell you the picture in a nice keepsake frame. I was a sucker and couldn't say no. It was a nice picture and a nice keepsake from our trip.  \n\nAll in all I enjoyed the food and service was solid. Would recommend!
