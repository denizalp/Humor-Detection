For Terminal 1, FIVE STARS, for terminal 3, three stars.\n\nAfter you check in at terminal 1 for international flights, the airport is so huge that there are the normal belts that you can stand on and...wait for it....THE SUPER FAST conveyer belts that ZIPS you by. Make sure you're standing and holding onto the right part though, or else your feet and hands will be squished. The materialistic goods (shops) and art installations are really pretty for Terminal 1, though there's not many shops in Terminal 1 - definitely not great to stall your time, but there's ipads and charging stations all around for you to spend your time on.\n\nGoing into the states in terminal 1, you go past the border right away, and it's on the leftmost part of the airport when you check in at the front. Domestic flights are way on the right side, so if you get lost, there's a few tips right there. After going past the borders for the States, there are more shops in this section than the international one, in my opinion.\n\nTerminal 3 however, is much older and definitely not as pretty as Terminal 1. The shops are much older as well.
