I'm sorry to have to do this but I have to tell the truth. I have been flying Southwest Airlines every week for the last 2 years so I think I have a good enough sample size to give them a review. Southwest is absolutely, positively the worst airline our great aviation industry has ever created. It is the equivalent to the greyhound bus of the 1970s. To be fair--most of their employees are great. They seem to care for the most part and they have gotten me safely to my destinations but not without headache. Constant delays of an hour or more every time I fly. I live in  the Southern California. It isn't a weather issue. Their schedulers are terrible. Loading of planes is constantly late. They are plagued with mechanical problems and they NEVER apologize. I don't know what else to say. They need some one to challenge their model.  They totally suck!\n\nPlease help!!!
