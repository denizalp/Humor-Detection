I had one of the best meals at Soyo most recently. Keep that chef cooking in the back because it's amazing!\n\nI had boo dae chigae (military soup) and it was by far one of the best I've had. \n\nThe ttuk pokki (spicy rice cakes) were also on point with the sauce being thick and not watery like some places. \n\nThe chaewook bokkum (spicy pork) was legit with tender meat and amazing, robust flavored. \n\nKimchi Jun (kimchi pancake) was super crispy through out--exactly the best way to eat it.\nIf they keep this up, it'll be hard to keep me away from being a weekly regular.
