Harumi Sushi is by far my new favorite place to grab sushi here in the Valley.  I went with a group of 10 people, and not one person had a bad food experience.\n\nTo start, the rice is purple.  Yes.....PURPLE!  Apparently, it is a black rice that turns purple once cooked and is filled with extra antioxidants and other components that are good for you.  And trust me, even if it wasn't good for me I'd still be asking for it.  I don't know what it is, but it is phenomenal!\n\nThe dishes we shared were the Ahi Stack, Spicy Scallop roll, and Salmon Sashimi.   Holy moly; the Ahi Stack was unlike anything I've ever eaten.  I thought it was a roll, but instead it is a mountain of ahi tuna, crab and spicy sauce on top of a mound of purple rice topped with fresh avocado and roe.  We inhaled it, and will definitely get it again.  And the salmon is the most buttery, fresh salmon I have ever had in the valley.  They top it with their homemade fresh wasabi, which was also fabulous!\n\nI docked 1 star because when we went to pay there was a lot of confusion and some people received their bills, some didn't, some didn't get their cards back for awhile.....it was a cluster, but definitely forgivable.\n\nIf you love sushi, I definitely say run, Run, RUN to Harumi!!
