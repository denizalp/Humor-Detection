Wow. The plumber was very professional and courteous, but after talking to his manager quoted me $800 to do something I told him Roto Rooter did for $150 last year(for the record it was an issue with the ejector pump on our guest house). Maybe Mr. Goodrich needs to spend less on his commercials so he doesn't need to charge so much.
