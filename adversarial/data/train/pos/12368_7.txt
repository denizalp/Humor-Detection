This place may lack the buzz of other restaurants on the Strip (although it's backed by the Maccioni family who have Le Cirque in the Bellagio, not to mention their iconic place in New York) and they don't have the best location (away from most foot traffic and tucked away in an obscure part of Aria), but their food is good enough to draw more praise than they do. They should be in contention for the best Italian cuisine in the city, but somehow they're forgotten by just about everyone not staying in the hotel.\n\nStarting our meal was the arugula and black mission figs salad ($19). Sweet and fruity from the figs and saba, the flavors were complimented by the bite of the gorgonozla and slight bitterness of the arugula. The beef carpaccio ($20) was plated differently than your typical carpaccio dish, with each slice of beef rolled around arugula and mushrooms and topped with capers and parmigiano reggiano. \n\nThe two pasta dishes we tried were both very good. The pappardelle ($29), topped with foraged mushrooms and cipollini onions, had a deep, savory and earthy quality to it. In contrast, the sweet corn ravioli ($25) was much sweeter. Thanks to the corn and the liberal use of butter, the dish left us craving more. It was, by far, the best plate of the night.\n\nUnfortunately, we were too full to try anything else, but a return trip is guaranteed. Despite a menu that isn't very large -- two pages in all -- their refined cuisine should be on the short list of best Italian on the Strip.
