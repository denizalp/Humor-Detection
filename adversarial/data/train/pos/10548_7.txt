I would give no stars if it was an option.  This location is convenient to my home and children's daycare so I've used it a handful of times to drop off pre-labeled and packaged FedEx for work.  The owner makes you complete an extra form and asks 10,000 questions about what is in each package.  Just completely unnecessary.  I will go out of my way to drop off at another location from now on.
