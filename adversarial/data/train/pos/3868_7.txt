The food and the value at this restaurant are just fine.  This comment is more about the attitude and service.  \n\nI arranged and made a reservation for a dinner for 4 people for a Saturday evening.  At the last minute, we added a 5th friend who we were happy to have join us for a nibble, although they had already eaten.  I called up and changed the reservation to 5 people.\n\nThe restaurant was perhaps half full at most through the entire time we were there.  The first four of us ordered a complete meal as planned.  When the 5th person said that she would not have anything, the waiter immediately responsed, quite harshly, that everyone has to order a full meal on weekends.  He went over to the owner to check with him who came over and reluctanty said 'this time, but we don't allow this on weekends'.  Our 5th guest, to keep the peace, ordered a salad.  Notwithstanding I was embarrased and I think the owner should be embarrased.  4 people ordered full meals....it should not have been such a big deal to have a 5th tag along.   I understand that the restaurant is in the business of serving meals and drinks to make money.   If the restaurant was full I might understand the attitude, but it was nowhere near the case.  \n\nI regret not making a bigger fuss over this when I was there, but I did now want to put on a show in front of my company.  However, I will speak with my wallet.  We have gone to this restaurant several times over a number of years, but it is unlikely that we will go there again.  I don't want to go to a place that makes their guests as uncomfortable as we were made to feel that evening.
