I am a regular customer who comes in DAILY and supports the gas station, the car wash, and the restaurant. I'm appalled at the lack of concern and assistance  by the manager who watched me wait for 45 minutes for my breakfast and did NOTHING. I'm not one to make a scene so I waited until I left to call him and discuss his lack of customer focus. He never called me back.  That interaction speaks volumes to me. You've been warned.
