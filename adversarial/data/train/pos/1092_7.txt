I bellied up to newish Narami for lunch with a friend last week, and I'm already excited to return. The one-at-a-time omakase-style experience and the wild ceiling are perfect for both pictures and a truly relaxing experience.\n\nThe chef's special roll was complex with a crab base, and it was delicious but it wasn't the star. The love and care in the handrolls really stood out, but it's the scallops, oh the scallops, that I'll be dreaming of for nights to come. Like butter. Do not skip the scallops.
