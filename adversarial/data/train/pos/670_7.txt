Guys, it's still summertime in Arizona and it is spicy as heck.  Time to go to Italy... or at the very least, the nearest gelato shop!\n\nAh, the long awaited Popbar has made a home for itself in Arizona.  Finally, what others across the nation have been enjoying, us desert rats get to have our gelato\/yogurt\/sorbet on a stick too.  The ingredients are fresh and the bars are made daily.  The actual flavors seems pretty light and delicate.  It gets masked by the dips and toppings so easily.\n\nSo maybe the day was TOO spicy but the creamy gelato didn't really hit the spot.  Halfway through the rich treat, I was dying of thirst.  Can a girl get a glass of water?  It's a tasty treat for sure and I'll definitely try them again on a day when I'm not on the brink of dehydration. \n\nAnyways, I'd probably stop by again if I was cruising around Westgate but I don't think I'd make a point to drive across town for Popbar. Give it a try thought! Our three Gelato pops came out to be $16ish.
