Sitting by the window on a beautiful autumn evening, I enjoyed every bite of the 3 dishes shared with my husband. \n\nI am not a big cheese eater but the Ombra cheese was just nutty delicacy. He was partial to the Shakerag blue (cheese). \n\nThe tomato bisque was creamy goodness with just right amount of tomato flavor. The grilled cheese sandwich was beautifully grilled though some may like it a bit cheesier. \n\nThe pork belly was sublime.  \n\nService was on point and we got to enjoy nice conversation without being interrupted. \n\nPeople watching through the window was delightful. Belmont downtown is always charming. \n\nBest meal I have had in a long time.
