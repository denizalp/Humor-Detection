This is the best Dairy Queen in Brampton.\nIt used to also be the ONLY DQ in Brampton for a really long time.\nThey have a tonne of staff and there is always a crowd here. Family, friends, little leaguers. \nI like the daily deals they have Monday to Friday.\nI believe Monday is the peanut buster parfait. Tuesday is the banana split. Friday is smoothies. \nWow... it's sad I know that.\nThe staff here is great. They're extremely fast and friendly. The product is good. The location is good.\nDefinitely deserving of 5 stars :).
