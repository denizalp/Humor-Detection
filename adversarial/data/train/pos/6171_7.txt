Hands down, best club in Vegas! \n\nIt was a Saturday night and I wanted to check out our ex-favorite TAO-- but as usual it was so crowded we couldn't breath! We decided to head on over to XS.. smart move! There's no way around the $20 cover BUT if you're hot enough you will probably be able to skip the MASSIVE line and get to the front!\n\nOur friend had bottle service so we got to party it up in the cabanas! The venue is GORGEOUS and huge! I got to see Diddy, Mario Lopez and Jermaine Dupri! :) \n\nDrink up! Any night at XS is definitely going to be epic!
