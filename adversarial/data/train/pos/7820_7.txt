Horrible services. Last time when we were here, we order 6 drinks and waited for 30-40 mins and drinks still not out so we went up and ask and they said: \"oh, you still have another 2 Hrs wait, they were someone who order a lot through the phone\". We understand that you have to make that first but at least let us know before we waited for 30-40 mins and we have to approach to find out. The owner, his name is Devon; instead of apologize but said (with a tone of not caring): \"you want your money back?\" Heck yea I want my money back and will never come back as well!! \n\nAs for their drinks, they use powder and they go very heavy on the ice sometimes.
