My brows were starting to look Neanderthal-ish, so I needed to get that under control.\nI remember driving past a threading spot close to Smashburger up in my hood, so we checked this place out.\n\nClean and inviting, the ladies greet you walking in, and there are comfy chairs to chillax until your turn is up. Other services performed here are Henna and Glitter Tattoos, Eyelash Extensions, and Brow and Lash Tinting. I had Sarah take care of me. At first, I was kinda iffy because the girl she did before me was in tears with a puffy red face!?!?\n\nWhy??? She was a first timer...couldn't be more than 13 years old, dragged mom with her, and she wanted to do it...Youngins these days, that's the price you pay for beauty, right? No fault on Sara's part, just a little girl tryin' to be all grown up.\n\nMy turn is up, and Sarah does her magic, first with the little brow comb and scissors, a snip here and there, then on to the threading. Assisting her a couple of times and after about 5 minutes, Voila!!! Sara has that ability to keep Men's brows neat and clean without looking feminine which is a big plus, then later finishes your brows with a little astringent and lotion to soothe your pain(if you have any) at $10, this is the cheapest in town, and the quality of work is better than those other threading joints. .\n\nYeah, you can save money like Geico, but you'll also look like the Geico Caveman, and no one wants to be rocking the unibrow or Velcro strip on their face. At least I wouldn't..\nThere were three other women after me, all waiting for Sara....go see her, she knows what she's doing...ALOHA!!!
