Babystacks, I've given you many a go. Inconsistent dishes, mediocre service, but two of the tastiest breakfast items I've had to date.\n\nBabystacks is know for its fluffy pancakes and its Island inspired breakfast items. Adobo Fried Rice. I don't know what this stuff is made out of, but it's so addictive (so probably crack)! On a previous visit, I overheard a guy ask for the rice as a side and the waitress said, of course. A big pile of fresh adobo fried rice arrived with his order.\n\nOn my last trip I asked for just a side of the rice and was denied. Being in a large group and not feeling particularly bratty, I let it slide as a friend said she'd take my eggs and I could have the filling. When the food arrived, the rice was delightful except for how crunchy it was. Starving and because the rice was so damn tasty, i plowed away. I was insatiable. To this day, I still find my self muttering Adobo Fried Rice in my sleep...\n\nThe rest of the menu is hit or miss, including the pancakes. Most are simply pancakes with dope toppings, but the pancakes aren't anything spectacular. The most delightful I've had were the Cookies N Creme pancakes. Diabettttus for breakfast, but heavenly.\n\nI don't hate, Babystacks, but I don't love them either. Very middle of the road. It's a coin toss and the same can be said for your experience there as well.
