I'd never have imagined finding a Midwestern\/Chicago staple so far away from the Midwest! This AZ location is set up exactly as the other ones I'd been to in the Chicagoland area - you can see everything done behind the counter, the lines and tables are the same, etc. \nThankfully when I met up with one my friends here the lines were nonexistent and it wasn't terribly busy. First things first - gotta order a Cake Shake! She wasn't aware of their existence, so at my insistence she ordered one - hallelujah! I also got a plain hotdog with peppers to liven things up, and I knew a #CakeShake wouldn't hold me over until dinner. The employees were nice, the place was clean, all wonderful. Cannot wait to return for a more proper Chicago meal.
