I have only been here two times but I enjoyed my second time as much as my first time. It doesn't look like a typical Vietnamese restaurant but I enjoyed the interior mix. The music isn't too loud and the girl that served us both times is very nice! She knows what she's doing and she constantly checked up on us. That's some great customer service! The first time I came, I ordered the oxtail pho and it was so good. It was filling as well and I thought that this would become the place whenever I wanted oxtail pho. My family and I also ordered oxtail fries with shreds of oxtail meat in sauce that is poured on top of the fries. I don't eat fries at all and I was trying not to eat it but I have no regrets. If I was to eat fries, it would only be the oxtail fries because that was seriously the best thing I have ever eaten... In terms of French fries. We also ordered hot tea and they give you this big tea cup with tea bags. The hot tea served is green tea and they give you pots of hot water. I think that topped it all off because when you eat late at night to early morning, you just want good food served in attractive cups, bowls, or plates. This place is a must try and it is just wonderful!
