The best dim sum we have had in Las Vegas. The wait was definitely worth it. If you are a dim sum lover like me, this is the place to go. It was authentic Asian dim sum. My favorite were the BBQ pork buns. There were lots of different things to try and wasn't able to try it all. Strange that it was located in an older hotel, but the food tasted great!
