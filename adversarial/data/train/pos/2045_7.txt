Probably my favorite room for cash games.  The staff is very helpful, dealers are friendly, efficient and most of the cocktail waitresses are at least a solid 7 out of 10.  \n\nThere's always action and you can find most low\/midstakes games you're looking for.  I also feel like the nicer the casino, the better shot you have at sitting with players that have money to burn and can reload a few times.  \n\nHaving the option to eat while playing is a plus too.  I wouldn't do it though.  Touching poker chips and then eating fries sounds gross.  \n\nI hate the DOJ for shutting down online poker in the US but if I gotta play live...I'll play here.
