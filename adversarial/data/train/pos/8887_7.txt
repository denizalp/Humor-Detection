We asked the cabbie on the way back to the airport to not take the freeway to save us time and money and he did the exact opposite.  Charge was over $30.\n\nUsed a competitive cab company when we arrived who could follow directions and our fare was only $18.\n\nShady.\n\nBe very careful when you hail your taxi to avoid this company!
