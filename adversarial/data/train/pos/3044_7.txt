Slow service and sub-par traditional breakfast food. I stopped by this mall-based breakfast restaurant after a workout for some quick lunch with friends and waited over 45 minutes from ordering until my food arrived. For simple greasy flat top grill food that amount of time is pretty inexcusable. Also, they needed to work the grill a little better: there were burnt black bits of food stuck to our pancakes. \nNothibg at all about the food stood out. Things were made decently if greasy. The hollandaise sauce on the eggs Benedict tasted packaged and the pancakes were chewy and overdone. \nService was slow. Only one coffee refill in an hour and a half and the post-food delivery checkup didn't happen until we were pretty much done. \nDecor is aged and falling apart. Washroom was pretty disgusting.\nWon't come again.
