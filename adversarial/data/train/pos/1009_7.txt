I've almost certainly gone back to this place more than any restaurant in Toronto (McDonald's excluded, obviously). It's almost entirely reliable in terms of a decent time. At its best - it's excellent and at its worst-  it's pretty good.\n\nNew favorite time to go: late Sunday nights. Enjoy the staff's full attention, eat at your leisure as they close down shop, and have a pizza that will make you hate Monday morning a little less (especially if you keep some leftovers).
