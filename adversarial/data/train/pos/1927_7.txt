This place used to be the go to place for fun times downtown, but not anymore. They now charge to go upstairs to the outside patio and their drink prices are outrageous. This place is simply full of douche bags that feel they're something special by being able to push through lines and walk up some stairs to just stand around listening to terrible DJs. No thanks.\n\nSave your money & find somewhere better to go.
