This is another example of businesses making poor choices when it comes to customer service to please the dumb bunnies on the religious right.  I needed to pick up something, the place is normally open on Sundays, however because it was a \"special\" Sunday they were closed. The world is not revolve around Christianity.  If you say you're going to be open on Sundays be open every Sunday including ones called easter.  What a crock.
