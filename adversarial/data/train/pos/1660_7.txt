I used Laguna Pool and Spa with the help of Damon Lang for my backyard project.  The work was finished 2 weeks ahead of schedule.  The workers were great and had no issues on communication.  \n\nThe office staff was awesome with handing my small concerns and answering questions during and after the work was complete.  Huge plus for me. \n\nMy wife and I are so happy with the result and I'm happy I chose Laguna.
