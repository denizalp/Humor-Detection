Ewww... another label bites the dust. They have low quality cheap clothing made specially for their outlet stores... Occasionally you might find a hand me down that didn't get sold from their regular Guess store but the majority of the stuff here is a step down from their normal stuff. Not worth your time. But if it is hot enough, definitely worth your time in the store... they REALLY blast the AC.
