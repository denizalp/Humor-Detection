I attended an *art* event at @MarqueeYYC and was quite displeased to find out that they had a \"mandatory\" coat check policy.  Their sign indicated that the rule came straight from the AGLC (Alberta Gaming and Liquor Commission).  When I probed, the coat check attendee was apologetic and said, \"I have no control over it.\" .... that is total BS because A) There is no AGLC by-law which states a coat check is mandatory.  If it were, then all places that serve alcohol would be doing this and they aren't; the AGLC did have a roundtable on violence where a participant endorsed mandatory coat checks, but someone saying something at a roundtable discussion does not make it a LAW!  B) Once inside I counted about 5-6 people with their coats on.\n\nThis establishment clearly discriminates upon appearance, age and possibly race.  They mask their policies under the AGLC umbrella so people are less likely to complain.  The coat check is nothing more than a cash grab at $2 a coat.\n\nOnce inside the band that was playing during an ART event had really bad sounding levels which tells me either their sound system is crap or they have really bad sound people working there.\n\nClearly the management at Marquee Beer Market has a violence issue and they use deception of the laws to try and combat it.  It's a matter of distrust in the management which will never make me return.
