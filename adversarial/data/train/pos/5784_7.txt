We weren't in the mood to go to some boring chain and we weren't having a whole lot of luck searching for breakfast places because we had already been to most of them.  After getting a little deeper in the search, the husband suggested this place.  \n\nI was immediately surprised when we walked in by the sheer amount of tables and chairs they managed to pack into this tiny little restaurant.  This is definitely not a place to come and eat if you have personal space issues.  While it was extremely busy inside we were immediately seated at a tiny table for two and greeted by a sweet lady named Sue.\n\nI ordered the Country Breakfast with Bacon so I could try a little of everything that this place had to offer.  My meal came with 2 eggs, bacon, biscuits and gravy, fried potatoes, and the awesome little muffin basket everyone has talked about.  The little muffin basket served pre-meal like bread at an Italian restaurant is why I give this place 4 stars instead of just 3.  Everything else was average but good.\n\nThe prices were fair, the amount of food was plentiful, and the service was quick and friendly.  I could definitely see myself coming back here if I am in this part of town.
