Worst management, worst customer service. People get stuck in elevate and no one cares. You come in they treat you so bad. I truly don't\nRecommend for any one to enroll at this Charlotte NC location. I witnessed two elderly people stuck at their elevator and they didn't do anything about it for half an hour. LA fitness should change the management.
