My coworkers have probably dragged me here like a bazillion of times, and every time this place has delivered an awesome experience. \n\nThe service has always been fast, the staff members has always been funny and friendly!!  They once let us use a bunch of coupons which I don't think was allowed, but they wanted our money so they did it.  We have good high quality money too, crisped and unfolded.  The place has always been super clean, and the restrooms is always kept up. \n\nI always order their kids meal because it's the exact amount of food I need without making me fall asleep at work afterwards.  Their food is of some quality because it can stay in my body for a while. Usually takes about 3 hours before I do a two.  And their fries is a little thin... but tastes amazing!  And the cheese burger... much better than McDonald's!! It's toasted to perfection.\n\nOverall come here for a kids meal, it's mathematically the right portion of food.
