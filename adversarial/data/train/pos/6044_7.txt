I could not stand the smoke odor, even in the non-smoking area.  My visit was less than an hour and I had to take a bath immediately after because my hair and clothes reeked of cigarette smoke.  Then I bagged and tied my clothes so they would not contaminate the rest of my luggage.\n  \nI did like the hotel room and service by the staff at the hotel though \n \nI fear for the health of the casino employees who work in this unhealthy smoke filled environment.  Maybe they could invest in a better air ventilation system or let the smokers have their own separate casino!
