1 star :  for  very friendly service; everyone was happy to be working there\n\n1star : for okay food\n\nDessert at the buffet; awful. Especially when indian cuisine is so colourful and rich. Disappointed. \n\nBut not  that disappointed; i knew what i was walking into when i opened the door.\n\nCheap + convenient, below average, nothing special, can cook better at home, indian edibles.
