This review is for MAC Cosmetics (counter) at Nordstrom.  Please save it about it being horrible for your skin unless you have solid clinically based studies for me to review.  \n\nI had been looking for a new foundation forever (really only a week and a few days but if you read my reviews for Merle Norman and Sephora you will know why it seemed like forever) and I finally decided to go back to my trusty MAC Studio Fix powder foundation.  \n\nI went to the MAC counter and to my surprise wasn't totally ignored!  The girl said she'd be right with me!  After a minute or two another very pretty lady offered to help me.  I was interested in the Mineral foundation.  She tried the pressed powder version on me but it was definitely  not my color - although she thought it was - it was too red (again read other reviews).  \n\nSo she tried the loose MIneral powder on me - again too red and dark.  I asked to try the lighter shade, the next one down from the one she just tried, and she said, \"Thats gonna be too light for you.\"  OK?  \n\nSo I guess the customer is never right anymore because that's the second time that's happened in my quest to find a friggin foundation!  \n\nANYHOODLE... at that point I was too tired of looking and trying to tell people that they don't know how to pick colors for SHIT, so I just asked her for Studio Fix in C4 (YELLOW BASED!!!).  \n\nShe goes \"Oh, is that what you have on now?\"\nI say \"Yeah.\"\nShe says \"OH!  I would've thought that was too light for you but it matches perfectly.\"\n\"oh yeah!?\" I said, in mock surprise.\n\nDUH!\n\nAnyway, I am going to stop asking these supposed makeup artists to match me.  I LOVE MAC and I wish I remembered the chicks name that found C4 for me like 4 years ago, she's the only one who knew what she was doing.  She actually looked at my skin and saw that I have Yellow based skin tones and not friggin PINK!  JESUS EFFIN H MAN!\n\nSeriously.\n\nOh... 4 stars for the makeup itself.  The pretty girl with no eyesight gets 1 star for helping me, maybe a 1\/2 star for being something nice to look at while I was annoyed.
