I'm not much of a brunch person but this is one fun and nice place for it. Our \"day after a wedding\" group of 12 enjoyed a nice meal here in this French inspired restaurant. The Bloody Marys were excellent.  Though I must caution you on the large Mimosas - no price on the menu - they are $15 each!  Zounds!  \n\nThe Croque Monseurs and Madams were deemed a success as was the smoked salmon dish. Everyone seemed satisfied by this experience.  Which is hard to do with a group this big. \n\nAn error on one of the bills was quickly and smoothly resolved.  \n\nNext visit to Madison I need to try dinner here.
