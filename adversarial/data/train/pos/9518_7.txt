My first time here and I'm impressed. The place is cozy(a bit small) but not crowded or cluttered. We came in for a quick bite before our son's play down the street. This Ukrainian restaurant did not disappoint. The wife had an order of sauerkraut balls and I had chicken paprikash stew. Both were AMAZING!! There was live music setting up as we were leaving. We'll be back.
