A normal person would visit Breese Stevens for some sort of sporting event, but I have to be a total weirdo and visit for Shakespeare. There's a nice covered area for seats at the head of the field, and we brought folding camp chairs to keep from having to sit on the concrete slabs. We  also brought our own picnic, which was nice and definitely atypical for most fields. Parking was easy in the neighborhood behind the field and the setting sun provided some lovely light. Hoping to make it to a Radicals frisbee game this season to see the field in use for something closer to its intended purpose.
