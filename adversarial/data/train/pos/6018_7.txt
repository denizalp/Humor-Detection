I was surprised by the size and scope of this store.  They have dive classes and just about everything you could ask for EXCEPT any level of customer service.  Perhaps I caught them on a bad day but considering it was my first and apparently last visit they really drop the ball.  I went looking for some bike equipment and possibly a new mountain bike.  3 associates were in that department so I was sure I would get help.... Nope.  20 minutes and not a single acknowledgement I was there.  Considering I needed advice to make a purchase I left empty handed.  My daughter, who wanted the $180 bike, was crushed because I had planned to get it for her but not at that level of service.  As we walked away she asked \"why are we leaving\" and I responded \"because they obviously don't want my money here.\"  My 4 year understood the concept to bad Sports Chalet did not.  Sadly the clown at Walmart answered my question within 2 minutes.  Beaten by walmart!  What a joke.
