I ate at Pier 54 again on 3\/24\/17. It was a terrible experience:\n\n- Very bad service, waited 45 minutes for sandwiches.\n- Food quality was disgusting. My wife received a dry, tasteless Reuben, and my MIL received a dry, tasteless grilled cheese sandwich.\n- Fries were not brought out until after the main entrees came out. Fries were greasy and disgusting. \n- Wait staff was apathetic, slow, and unpleasant. Our server did the best she could with the support she received. Terrible, terrible wait staff\/management.\n\nI paid $48 for the worst meal I've ever had. Very bad service and management. \n\nIf I'm paying a premium to eat on the water I want excellent service and good-quality food, not cheap buns and frozen fries from Costco. \n\nThere was even a disgruntled customer who left her meal at the bar, and who told the entire crowd how lousy her meal was.\n\nPier 54, time to get a makeover or move on. \n\nI'm moving on. I live in the Lakes and will never, ever return. Terrible, terrible experience.
