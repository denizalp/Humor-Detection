This \"concert\" was so bad that I actually felt the need to write a review. If you are looking for a nice \"Christmasy\" show then this is not for you. If you are looking for a bunch of washed up wanna be 80's hair band rockers who weren't good enough to make it in the 80's so they found a niche convincing people that they did good Christmas music then YOU ARE IN LUCK!! Like everyone else my wife and I know the two TSO songs that you hear every year on the radio. They are nice Christmas songs so we thought this may be a good holiday experience. Boy were we wrong!! I wish I had done more research and realized that this was nothing more than a corny rock opera by people with decent electric guitar skills and below average vocals. I don't think one of the singers of this POS could turn a chair on the voice. Even my wife, who is in love with crappy 80's hair bands wanted to leave after the first 15 minutes. Complete trash. Even the 2 decent songs you hear of theirs on the radio are butchered in the live performance. There is more hair flipping in this show then in a Poison concert!! The costumes resemble that of Transylvania style with the narrator taking the role of Dracula. Its basically Twilight meets This is Spinal Tap minus the awesomeness of Spinal Tap and overload the crappiness of Twilight. All in all, its shit. Don't waste your money on this!!
