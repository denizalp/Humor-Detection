Meeehhh. \"Shrugs shoulders\" I don't get it. \n\nSo follow me on this one. \n\nYou walk up to the door and someone opens it for you. That's nice right? \nWell then you don't really know what to do next. There is a path in front of you, one to the left and one to the right. Hmmmm I didn't go out to eat to have to make these kinds of decisions. There is no hostess. So you keep walking straight. Then you see a big kitchen. Above the kitchen counter they have a big board which displays the menu. By default you stop moving forward and look. This causes a traffic jam and people behind you also become confused. Then we were asked to step to the counter. We do as instructed and the cashier asks what we would like. I say I have no idea this is all happening to fast. I have never been here and the choices are vast.\n\nAnyways. We order and apparently you have to take a piece of paper with you to find a table that matches the number they write on the paper. I asked the guy where table 96 was and he had a hard time explaining it... That did nothing for my confidence, being the one who actually had to do the finding. \n\nSo.., then we find out we have a server. Oh but not a regular one. This server only brings your food and refills your ketchup. Also you have to get your own drinks at a fountain far from your table. \n\nThe fries were yummy that's the one star. The burgers were raw not medium well and we had them send them back multiple times until we gave up and went somewhere else. We didn't have to pay because apparently you do that after you eat instead of when your in line ordering??? So weird. I'm not a fan. \n\nSo take all of that and add to poorly cooked burgers and I shout a big no thanks to you kind sir.
