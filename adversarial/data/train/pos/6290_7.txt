Truth be told, the five stars is probably due to a bit of nostalgia kicking in, but I was one happy customer!\n\nWe don't have Roberto's in NorCal, which is a real shame.  I thought they were only in Southern California, and therefore was very happy to discover this one in Las Vegas, just a couple of blocks from our hotel.  When I was in college in San Diego, I used to hit up Robertos restaurants (and the other copycat taco shops, like Roybertos, Albertos, Alibertos, etc.) on a regular basis.  Cheap, greasy, delicious food was available at nearly all hours of the day.\n\nOn this visit, we picked up a couple of orders of rolled tacos with guacamole and cheese, a quesadilla, and a couple of carne asada tacos.  The restaurant was incredibly clean, and the staffers were friendly, even at 10 pm on a Saturday night.\n\nThe food was just as good as I'd remembered.  I hope I run into another Robertos on my travels again soon!
