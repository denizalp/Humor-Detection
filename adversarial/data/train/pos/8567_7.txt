Rhino has the highest review on Yelp, so I choose them to clean my new build home. Guess I was the unlucky one from all the good reviews here.  I found a large scratch on my glass shower that night. So I began to go through all the glasses they had cleaned and found more scratches. When they said they'll fix it, I start to believe the reviews here are true that this is a great company.  After they had a glass specialist came to evaluated and quoted. Their conclusion is to refund me back my cleaning fee and blame the scratches were already there before they clean it. Even the specialist told me these scratch marks were cost by the squeegee. I am devastated! The refund cannot cover the cost of damages in my house. There goes my new build home.
