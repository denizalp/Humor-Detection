On the fourth night S&P was open, 6 of us gathered for dinner trying an assortment of dishes from this new restaurant of Cory Harwell and his associates at Simon Hospitality Group in the old Firefly location in Henderson.  \n\nDishes we tried were:\n\nGarden tomato salad\nSalt and pepper fries with 3 dipping sauces\nCarrot risotto\nScallop crudo\nCrispy oysters topped with trout roe\nCalamari with mixed peppers and cilantro\nTongue and cheek agnolotti\nVenison tartare with bacon bread\nMeatballs with house made ricotta and Sunday gravy\nSnail Wellington\nDate and blue cheese jam\nMac and cheese--three cheeses with port wine\nSaffron rice pudding\nCheese and wine sundae with cheesecake blondie and merlot ice cream\nPain perdu--Lost bread with lots of cinnamon and maple icing\n\nKudos to the staff for a wonderful meal given they had only been open a few days.  Standouts were the scallop crudo, crispy oysters, venison tartare with bacon bread and quail egg, and the date and blue cheese jam.  I also enjoyed the carrot risotto.  I was in a minority but I didn't care for the sweetness given the mac and cheese by the port wine and the Snail Wellington was too much pastry overpowering the snails.\n\nAs for the desserts, I'll take all of them please.  The pain perdu was delightfully cinnamony and the saffron rice pudding tasty.  The winner of the three was the cheese and wine sundae.  Chef Harwell explained that since he's not a fan of sweets, he was trying to come up with a dessert he might order like wine and cheese.  Through many iterations I'm sure, he and the staff worked until they came up with this winner.--a cheesecake blondie topped with merlot ice cream.\n\nService was excellent.  The restaurant has a great view of the Strip in the distance and the lights were just starting to come on as we left.  The restaurant was quite crowded and it was very loud.  Loud from people having a good time and not from trying to talk over blaring music.  Standard and Pour is a winner!
