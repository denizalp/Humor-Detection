We had dinner at the sushi and depanneur. It has an awesome atmosphere. I even found matcha powder in their convenience store. \nBeing anglophone here in Montreal can be difficult but even though they didn't have an English menu the waitress\/cashier was very accommodating. She brought us tea and miso soup then a salad before our meal. I did mention that I am vegetarian and she was also very attentive to that.\nI'd say the food, on the other hand, was mediocre. It could be the soy sauce or making each part of the meal a little different than what we expected.
