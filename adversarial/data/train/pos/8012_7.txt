I went to Pisces Reef for the first time yesterday with a ton of questions and I was given a lot of help and also given the information of the manager who is even more knowledgeable.  Everyone I talked to was pleasant, easy to talk to, respectful, kind and calm.  I felt completely comfortable walking around the store and looking in all the tanks.  \n\nThey had no problem answering my questions about freshwater plants, mystery snails, my tank cycle, etc.  I am extremely impressed.  And the store is just cool... the tanks are phenomenal and watching the shark swim around was a lot of fun!  I am definitely going to be a repeat customer.  I'm hooked!  ~Jules~
