Walked in for a brisk dinner before our late flight back to NY. Waitress was friendly and efficient. The space was casually trendy. Slightly overprices but the pizzas are good and under $20. I went with Prosciutto (San Marzano Tomatoes, Goat Cheese, Mozzarella, Wild Arugula). \n\nCouldn't try the booze on account of impending chauffeur duty but was tempted. You're probably paying a few extra bucks for the Wolfgang name, but this is a nice, safe choice for lunch or dinner.
