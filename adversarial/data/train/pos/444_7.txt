So-Cal is so-so:(  cute little place with good service, however the food presented was not of fresh ingredients or bold flavor. \n\nI tried the crab cakes which were okay, not my preference to deep fry, I'm more familiar & love the Boston fancy way honey, cooked to perfection in a skillet. On to the Clam Chowder in a bread bowl, I was super excited to try but was way disappointed, not fresh whatsoever this was nasty porridge in bread, ouch.\n\nFinally the 3 Taco plate \"Carne, Chicken & something else, forgot....oops. The Chicken Taco was old as if they re-served the chicken or had it had been there for awhile, I did mention this to our server that it was old, he did SMILE and say okay, silly boy was mesmerized by moi....or something.....lol\n\nMy final thoughts if it was a late night of  liquid poison, I would happily be back.....but since I don't....... Ciao
