I love the art museum, and I like popping into galleries from time to time but I don't really understand art. \n\nWith that in mind, Nuit Blanche didn't really do it for me. Most of the exhibits were just a bit odd (walking through a tunnel with 'rain' pouring down?). I did like the Soon, 2011 exhibit but other than that everything was just a bit underwhelming and half of it seemed to just be blatant advertising. \n\nThe crowds were insane and seemed to be dominated by 14-18 year olds. I won't be going back next year, but I guess I'm glad I checked it out. \n\nI do like the concept of Nuit Blanche, just not the execution.
