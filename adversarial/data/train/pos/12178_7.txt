The Statement\n\nI want to simply state it now. Calgary is a city comprised of very few truly master pastry chefs.  Including restaurant and hotel ones, I honestly can think of maybe 15 in all that I truly respect and adore for their mastery of all things baking. \n\nWhy? It's both an art AND a science. Baking is an art of taking exact measures, pushing the boundaries, hoping nothing explodes, and make the art a masterpiece, that never survives the day.  Some are absolutely supreme at bread, some at cakes, others at souffles. To me, Calgary's sole master in Croissants and Macarons is Sabastien, the chef-owner of Ohh La La Patisserie.\n\nThe Revelation\n\nI've actually had very very few of his macarons, as I have a personal allergy to almonds. However, there has been the odd time I said, F*** it, popped an allergy pill and damned the consequences. They're, and pardon the weird description, tender. That's the only way I can describe it. Firm, yet soft to the touch, and sensual to the palate. It's simply a single pleasure to enjoy.\n\nThe Admission\n\nBut what especially thrills me are his croissants. Flaky, rich and flavourful, from the simple butter croissant, to the decadent Maple. Each one has found a way into my stomach and my culinary dreams. I pace myself quite carefully admittedly, as whether it be the Chocolate Croissant or the Maple or whichever, they're just too rich to bear without going into a state of sugar-induced rapture. \n\nThe Complaint\n\nMy only complaints about the place really. The locale. It's just too far for me to make it there regularly. It's a destination trip really, where I know I can find a form of baked Nirvana waiting in the display. \n\nThe Future\n\nHi, My name is Terry. I am a Croissant-aholic
