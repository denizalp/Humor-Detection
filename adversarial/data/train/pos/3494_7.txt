Hadn't been in here for years, mostly because its a pain to get in and out of the parking lot. Located on the corner of Decatur and Tropicana, you can get stuck trying to turn left from southbound Decatur, so I highly recommend coming in from the northbound side for an easy right turn. Parking lot was fairly heavy.\n\nThis is the only place in town that I know of that sells lingonberries, for my swedish pancakes. Inside they have a fairly decent seafood selection with a wide range of fish and shellfish. You can find european and asian products here. They also carry a nice selection of cookware, some restaurant sized so if you are looking for a big pot to feed 20, this is the place!\n\n5% discount on items if you are a member. \n\nLots of stuff to look at and see. Plenty of tea sets, chinese decorations, and other stuff as well as food items and cookware. Fun store to browse around in.
