Best lounge in Phoenix! I now come here weekly because they have good scotch, a great selection of bottled beer, friendly bartenders, awesome music, a chill hipster\/burner themed setting, and cool people hanging out there. Try the specialty cocktails. I'll admit that I haven't had one yet, but my friends swear by them.
