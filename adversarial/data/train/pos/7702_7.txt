Nothing but positive vibes here! Did a little walk in yesterday and Danny was super accommodating. Listened to what I wanted but also gave me a ton of advice too! Shop is super clean, and everyone else was pretty nice too. The tattoo work itself was very affordable in my opinion, and Danny smashed out my tattoos in a pretty short amount of time but still put a lot of quality in it. I will definitely be back!
