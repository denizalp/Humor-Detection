I come to this Fresh & Easy when I just need a couple items and don't feel like dealing with the hassle of a busy Fry's or Safeway.  I don't think I have ever stood in any kind of line at this place, it is never very busy.  It is also good for a cheap workday lunch, and sometimes I'll take a gamble at the \"expiring today or close to it\" manager special section.  My cup of tortilla soup cost a dollar and has lasted me 2 meals!  \n\nWhat I do knock a star off for is the pretentious \"reserved\" parking.  Not for folks with handicaps, but for what I assume are for people with kids?? (The picture has 2 big people and 1 small person).  That isn't a handicap, sorry.  From what I hear these \"reserved\" spots vary by store location, I've seen another store with Hybrid Only parking.  If I get around to reviewing that store I will be sure to knock of 2 stars.  No need to make smug folks feel more entitled by letting them park 10 feet closer than me.\n\nBut, I overlook the parking space outrage and keep coming back.
