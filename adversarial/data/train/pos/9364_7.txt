If you're familiar with using Priceline, here's a tip: if you select \"South\" end for the Strip location and 5 stars, chances are you're bidding for a room at THEhotel. I mention this because I tried several times with no success. But in the end, I just booked a standard Mandalay Bay hotel room and upgraded to THEhotel for an extra $50 a night and it ended up being cheaper anyway.\n\nI thought that the room was nice, definitely better than your standard Vegas room. Having a separate section for the living room and the bedroom was a plus, especially if you have more than 2 guests staying over. The extra half bathroom near the door is also convenient for those who need all that time dolling up for a night on the town.\n\nHaving flat screen TV at every corner was nice too, especially in the bathroom near the sinks. Customer sevice was good. When we checked in, we noticed that the rooms in front of us were LOUD, going in and out of their room, talking, etc. So we called front desk and they sent a bellhop over right away and moved us up a few floors with a quieter location and a gorgeous view of the mountains with the snow.\n\nUltimately, THEhotel is nice if you can get a good rate at around $150 per night, less if possible. It's more of a walk from the convention area and the main casino area, but on the plus side you are close to the sports book and the shopping area where the Burger Bar is located, if that floats your boat. 3.5 stars. THEend.
