I LOVE MUNCH. YES, I'M TALKING IN CAPS BECAUSE I'M THAT EXCITED.\n\nWhile they classify themselves as Vegetarian\/Vegan, I would easily say that they're actually just \"health conscious.\" They use real ingredients and have actual \"good\" food that fuels your body. They also have meat options and even roast their own turkey in house! But if you have any dietary restrictions, they will custom make anything to fit your need.\n\nWhen you walk in, the bright walls in cheery colors and the bevy of local art for sale greet you. You order and pay at the counter, and they bring your food to your self-seated table. The menu is surprisingly large for this small caf√©, written all in chalk across a few boards.\n\nI ordered a peanut butter banana milkshake and Simon's Cilantro Chicken Salad as a melt, and I was so pleasantly surprised at its amazingness. As I watched the other guests around me receive their salads, I was in shock at how huge their portions are. My melt (don't think traditional melt, it wasn't greasy and gross) had the most tender turkey, delicious colorful veggies and freshest alfalfa sprouts. The gals around me had salads bigger than their faces. My smoothie was served in the cutest little mason jar and was rich with peanut butter flavor, not sugar. No frozen fruits or additives in this baby.\n\nLiterally, someone is going to have to try to convince me that there is a better spot in Solon to go for lunch or pick up a smoothie to go. Love this fantastic locally owned business!
