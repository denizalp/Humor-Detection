While I was visiting my Cousin Gwen who lives in El Mirage, my husband sent us out on a Girls Night Out. Yay! Since Gwen is new to the area, this was a first for both of us. We decided to head into Surprise and see what we could find. The Brookside was open, and it was a bar. OK, good so far. We walked in and sat down at the bar. The rest of the place seemed to have that feel of a concert venue after they turned the lights back on and only the stragglers were left. But, they had Guinness on tap, so it couldn't be all bad, right? So, of course, I had a Guinness, and Gwen ordered a Frozen Almond...something yummy looking. The bar tender was quick and efficient, and we had already had dinner, so we weren't interested in food. \n\nAs we chatted and caught up, we became aware of something of a spectacle going on to our right. A girl was flapping her arms, waving her hands and shaking her head faster than I though possible. It looked like she was trying to take off and fly. When she started walking to a table full of people we saw her teeeeeeeny tiny feet with blinking light up silver shoes flashing in the moderate dimness of the bar. She talked and flapped for a few more minutes before seemingly storming out of the bar. \n\nCheck please! We decided to move on. These guys definitely need to work on their ambiance here. It's Saturday night folks! Not Monday afternoon! Liven the place up a little! \n\nThe check was a pleasant surprise, however. $8.50 for both the pint of Guinness and the Pint of Frozen Almond goodness. Thumbs up on the prices, now lets work on the rest of it, folks!
