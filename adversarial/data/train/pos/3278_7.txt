Great spot for fresh authentic Hawaiian poke! (When entering, their fresh poke is straight ahead). \nThis restaurant actually consists of 3 different venders sharing a space. Into the separate room is the actually island sushi sit down restaurant. They offer AYCE sushi, which is good, not my favorite, but still yummy. I do love that they have many Hawaiian dishes and styled sushi!
