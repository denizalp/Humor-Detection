My partner ordered a sandwich for herself, and sweet potatoe fries for me (since am gluten intolerant and appetite wasn't big). Once the food came out complete disappointment from my end. Rather than assuming it's one order, separate the two. I was not able to eat my fries due to cross contamination of being on the same \"plate\" with the gluten filled sandwich. Thanks Geno's! I didn't get to eat! \"The fries were cold too!\" Said my partner.
