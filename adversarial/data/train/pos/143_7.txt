I hate exercise. \n\nOkay, that's a lie. I hate LONG PERIODS OF EXERCISE. So I have no idea why I thought huffing and puffing my way up Mount Royal on a blisteringly warm May day was a splendid idea. But i'm glad I did.\n\nAfter finally reaching the top, I decided to pop into mass - it was fantastic.  Everyone is going to say that the interior of the church is dull or whatever, and I can understand that. It isn't incredibly ornate, but it is still worth a trip inside considering how large the church is. A man inside (who felt the need to call me \"sugar lips\") said it was the largest church in Canada. \n\nThe so-called observation deck is the highlight. You can get a fantastic view of the city up there. Montreal doesn't have the ~best~ skyline, but I was in awe of the city.
