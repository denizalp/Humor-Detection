Are they serving magic here? \n\nThe line for samosas was ridiculously long. Like there was about 50 people there approx. Maybe I'm exaggerating . Maybe I'm not. \n\nBut they're specials are mad cheap. I want to come back when it's less busy.\n\nI ended standing in the smallest line of a modest ten people and I got the toonie special (Rice + 3 Veggie Curries for TWO FREAKING DOLLARS)\n\nI got:\n\n1. The Potatao + eggplant curry = I didn't see any eggplant in my serving so its a -. I love eggplant.\n\n2. The Kadhi (yogurt curry) = Awesome!\n\n3. The Mutter Paneer (Peas and Paneer) = Okay, not the best.\n\n\nSamosa King was too king-y for me  this time, as there were too many people paying homage to the throne.\n\nI'll re-review this again soontimes.\n\nUntil then, 2 stars.
