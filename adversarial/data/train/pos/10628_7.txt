I haven't been to a buffet since my early adolescent years when my mother would try to disguise me as a 9 year old to get the discounted kids pricing. After hearing a lot of rave about the decor and this place I recommended a friend visiting from China to dine here with me.\n\nThe decor was indeed quite bold and interesting. The ceiling is high and made for comfortable seating. It was odd because the decor is very traditional Chinese but they have huge TVs playing a baseball game.\n\nThe stars are given pretty much only for the decor. The food was less than impressive. Everything tastes like a 3\/10 - either over cooked and under flavoured. The sushi sashimi fish tasted very fishy. \n\nBonus info: little kids eat for $2.99, yes, two dollars and ninety nine cents. That's the silver lining I guess...
