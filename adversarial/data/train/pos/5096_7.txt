Just got delivery from Social Box and I have to say, I'm pretty damned impressed. And that takes a *LOT*, especially when it comes to the red meats in my life.\n\nI ordered the cashew calamari, ribeye certified, and short rib au poivre for an afternoon lunch, via delivery. They don't charge for delivery to my area which is nice, and their prices are pretty reasonable for what you're getting.\n\nAs soon as I opened up the boxes I peed a little in delight. The ribeye was PERFECTLY medium-rare. I say perfectly... PERFECTLY. And believe me, I am HARD on red meats. Marbled oh so nicely, and some pieces of it you could pull apart with your fork. The sides were really good as well- I had a fresh veggie and some fries. Both were comparable to anything that I could have made at home.\n\nThe short ribs were nice- a big beefy chunk with a nice peppery gravy. \n\nThe calamari absolutely knocked my socks off. And now I don't know where they are. I'm searching high and low for my lost socks... where aaaaarrrrrreeeee you, socks?? Anyhow, the calamari is amazing. The combination of rice noodles, bean sprouts, and calamari is delicious- it tastes almost pad-thaiey, if that makes any sense. I'd highly recommend checking it out.\n\nI haven't been to their actual location yet so I can't speak on how the restaurant looks in person, but for a nice night of hassle-free dinner delivery, this place can't be beat.
