I visited Progressive Field as part of a stadium-seeing road trip and was actually incredibly surprised by how much I enjoyed my experience there (even if Corey Kluber pitched for the Indians that night and destroyed the Yankees during the game... sad face). Besides watching the Yankees make ridiculous errors in the first inning, flail against Kluber's pitching, and end up losing the game? (sigh) There wasn't a bad view in the place. \n\nPerhaps one of the things I most enjoyed was the variety of concessions with locally-focused menus (or beer vendors with plenty of local\/craft options - even if one of the first locations I went to was staffed with folks who didn't know all that much about what local craft beers they were serving). There were generally a number of really great concessions though - food and drink options for everyone (one of my favorites being Barrio, \"tacos + tequila + whiskey\"... I mean, c'mon!). \n\nI actually walked around the park a number of times - alone and then with friends - in order to take in the entire experience. Heritage Park space is a nice little gem, and then there are classics like the Jim Thome statue, etc. \n\nTicket prices are pretty affordable, though I ultimately decided to take in the game from a seat in the Club level. Amenities in the Club level were delightful, with food and drink options included in the price... though I actually got most of my food from the main concourse level. That said, the Club Level even has random barrels of peanuts for every seating section... just fill up a little serving bag to go. :)\n\nTL;DR  Surprisingly awesome. Would definitely go back.
