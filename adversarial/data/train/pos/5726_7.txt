I'm only giving a 1 star because you have to give it something in order for the review to take!\n\n My family and I tried this place on Labor day and it was the worst!!! I made mention on their facebook page about the terrible food only for them to delete it!! \n\n My prime-rib sandwich was very soggy, so soggy I couldn't even pick it up to eat it because the bread was mush. My 2 year old had chicken strips that were so over cooked she couldn't even bite into it, my 8 year old ordered mac & cheese and I can almost bet it was Kraft mac & cheese! My husband had sliders, if Uncle Bear's specialty is burgers then they have some real work ahead of them because eating cardboard would have been tastier!!!\n\n Overall the food was anything but spectacular!! I will not eat here again and I would not recommend it to anyone either!!\n\nFIND ANOTHER PLACE TO EAT!!!!!
