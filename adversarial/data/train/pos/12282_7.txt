Many years ago I brought in a rare medium format rangefinder camera for consignment sale.\n\nThe tall Asian fellow (Stan\/Stanly?) in the used equipment, who seems to be extremely knowledgeable, fully inspected and accepted the camera.  I would stop by every couple of weeks to check if it's been sold.\n\nTwo months later he suddenly tried to tell me the camera was damaged when I brought it in, so I have to have it repaired before he can sell it.  I asked to see the camera, which clearly showed impact damage from being dropped on the ground.\n\nI became very infuriated with the stunt he was trying to pull, I challenged him: \"Would you have accepted this camera for consignment sale two months ago in this obviously damaged condition?\", he refused to answer, but still insisted I have to have the camera repaired at my cost before he can put it back on consignment sale.\n\nIt took raising my voice very loudly of his unscrupulous conducts on a Saturday in front of several customers before he grudgingly agreed to repair the camera at the store's cost, but still insisted the camera to be left with them for consignment sale after repair, so \"he can make back the repair cost\".\n\nThat was the last time I dealt with Downtown Camera, swore never to spend a penny there while this individual worked there.\n\nHappened to be in downtown area two weeks ago so stopped in to have a look, well the unscrupulous used camera guy is still there, guess I will keep on going to Aden Camera which I have had THE BEST experience with camera equipment for close to 20 years now, and would wholeheartedly recommend Eddie at the Young Street store without hesitation.
