Is this a church disguised as a coffee\/tea shop? I have wondered...\nLooking at other reviews also makes me wonder.\nI used the words, \"Big ass cup of tea,\" when ordering my drink, which was met with uncomfortable laughter. So, I'm thinking it's a church.\nWell, whether a for-profit church in disguise or a coffee\/tea shop, I like their tea. I like that they usually have several varieties of cold tea, both caf and decaf, at the ready. I also like that they have stevia available. \nIf a church, I'm not sure what they're preaching...the almighty dollar? If that's their god, then they're doing a good job. Business is good. If a non-profit, then they're not paying taxes on those profits. Makes me wonder so many things...the agenda. Where's my dollar going? Who's it supporting? \nWell, enough about that. They make a hella good cuppa tea.
