Upgrading this to a five after tonight's performance. On Mothers Day, full House, they were killing it. Excellent service and hot\/delicious\/fast food. They were well staffed and working together beautifully as a team. You were great with my kid's allergy. We all enjoyed our meals and how thoughtful to give us some free warm donuts to finish off the meal. \n\n________________\nLovely brunch this morning with a friend. This is a large but cozy restaurant based on placement of booths and part walls. Service was friendly and very good.\n\nMy friend and I opted for the $25 price fixe. It made sense when we were both having coffee\/tea. Apparently we ordered the two most popular items on the menu. \nChicken and waffles were delicious and plentiful. I took leftovers home. I was a bit surprised by the chili powder in the fried chicken and easily two tbsp of butter scooped on the waffle. I also would have liked more maple syrup to balance out the chili powder.\nMy friend really enjoyed her crab cake eggs benny and commented the s'mashed potatoes were really fresh.\nWe both had the mixed fresh berries for dessert which was just righ\n\nWashrooms were icy cold unlike the rest of the restaurant. It was below -20C outside though so not a normal day.\n\nAll in all a nice and repeatable experience.
