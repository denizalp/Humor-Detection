I would give negative stars if I could. Never have I been to a more incompetent, unprofessional office. I went here for severe allergies and saw a PA (I won't give her name for her sake) and despite giving a detailed description if my issues, (I am a nurse), which were similar to an issue I had before, she brushed me off, prescribed me some antihistamines, and long story short I ended up in emergency sinus surgery 2 weeks later. The office staff is rude, incompetent, and wait times are HORRIBLE at 30 minutes to an hour and a half. Especially for allergy shots. Who wants to sit in an office for 2 hours waiting for an allergy shot every single week?? DO NOT go to this place...I am surprised they are still in business!!!! They need to be turned into the BBB!!!
