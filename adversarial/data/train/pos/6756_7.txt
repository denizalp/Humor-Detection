I wish I could give the staff zero stars \nThese ppl are so fkn rude! Had to return some stuff for my mom & the reject working the door pulled the sticker off the item and stuck it on the bag - after she did her part for at least ten minutes (ridiculous) I go to customer svc & reject #2says the sticker has to be on it - so of course I say the lady at the door took it off -suddenly Another reject says - she's not talking to you ma'am you'll get your refund! I'm like EXCUSE ME BUT IF YOU NEED THE STICKER YA MIGHT WANNA LET THAT LADY KNOW SINCE SHE's THE 1 TAKING EM OFF DUHHHHHHH - & reject #2 says - yes ma'am I'm not talking to you - WOW! For real??!! \nGet a clue Walmart you rude ignorant assholes
