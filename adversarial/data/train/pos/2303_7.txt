Craft is a massive beer hall with a 100+ beers and plenty of good bar food. We stopped by around 11:30 and place was fairly busy and it also felt like a nightclub as they were blasting edm and old popular music. We both got a flight of local beers and they were a decent sampling. The poutine was tasty, especially since we added pork on to it. Our server was helpful and friendly. \n\nIt's a good place to get beers if you don't mind the loud music.
