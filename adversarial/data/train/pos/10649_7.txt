NO. NO. NO. NO.\n\nWent there about a month ago to celebrate a friend's birthday. She didn't want to go on the main strip, because it would be crowded for her. I had read reviews on this place, and got excited. It sounded fun enough, without being too sleezy crazy.\n\nWe went on a Saturday, and on their website, it says that they open at nine.\nWe got there, and their sign said that they opened at 10. \nThe bouncer assured me that they opened at nine.... We boarded the elevator at 915.\n\nThe elevator ride was...awesome. The elevation of this club is amazing, so sad that is being wasted by this place. They don't even have a full bar up there..... I asked for a mojito, and the bartender...very rudely told me that he couldn't make me one....\n\nSo, I ordered a very disgusting, and very expensive margarita..\n\nThe crowd.... is older.... I mean, grandparents older. We got there, and there were maybe ten other people out on the balcony.... smoking. There was NO DJ. They were playing some repetitive beat that was terrible.\n\nWe stayed for about an hour, hoping things would turn around, but they didn't.\n\nNo luck here.
