I just stopped in for a beer, so I can't comment on the food.  Its on the same line as a Hooters.  Some busty, scantily clad females that go over the top to pay you attention.  Strip club vibe, without the negative social stigma.  My beer was cold, my server was friendly, just not really my type of thing.  If you are a little older man, that want's some attention from young females, go for it.
