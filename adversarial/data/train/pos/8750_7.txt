Ever since the office moved to the new building, there were complaints of nowhere to eat. Wrong. Plenty of places. One of them is The Sandwich Club. \n\nI would only give it 3 stars, even though the Eggplant & Mozzarella Focaccia was the best ever. A few reasons:\n\n* Lines get very long during lunch time, so if you are in a hurry to grab something before the meeting, forget it. The orders are taken pretty quickly, however, they are fulfilled painfully slowly! If they only hired another person to prepare the orders, they would not be losing so many customers who are in a hurry (and I tell ya, being one of them sucks!)\n* There are 50 different varieties of potato chips on display. None of them are \"baked\" variety. \n* Very much empty space. I understand that the ownership wants to fill it with customers waiting for their orders, but still. A few more tables would be nice.\n\nOverall, good experience. You can buy your food there and eat in the park. By the way, they are putting the Ice Skating Rink there right now! Yay.
