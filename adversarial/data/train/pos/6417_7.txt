Thai Buffet with friendly service.\n\nGood place to eat when you don't know what to eat or just want to try variety of Thai food.\n\nI tend to order the same food over and over again at Thai restaurant but since I wanted to try more different dishes, I came here to try.\n\nI started with Thai tea, always good to have on standby just in case food is too hot. I went back three times to get different dishes and all were consistently good.
