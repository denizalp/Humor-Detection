After neglecting my poor feet for a year, I decided to treat myself to a nice pedicure. I went here and, while.from the outside it looks like a typical strip mall salon, it's anything but! Once inside it's quite spacious, and a waterfall creates a very tranquil atmosphere (paired with the large tvs on the walls that rotate scenic pictures of nature and relaxing music). \n\nTina was my tech and she was truly wonderful. The biggest thing for me when having work done is callous removal. TMI maybe, but mine are rough - and often in difficult to reach places. She did a fantastic job getting those down and took such care and precision in the whole process. Normally I feel the nail care of cuticles and buffing and trimming  is rushed but she took her time and was meticulous in her handiwork! \n\nThe chairs in this place were awesome! I rarely use them, as I find in most places they are simply not effective, but these ones here we're so big, cushy, and relaxing. By the time my appointment was done, I felt I had new feet and a new back! This will probably become my go to place for pedicures and I'm probably going to get them more often (my feet deserve better than what I give them, they really do)!
