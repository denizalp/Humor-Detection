This place is pretty far from where I live, but I'm glad I made the trip (sort of).\n\nThis place has only been opened for a little over the month. It's super clean, lots of seating, bright lighting, and the staff is wonderful. I had a couple of questions about the items on the menu, and the girl who took my order was super friendly and answered each and every question.\n\nTheir drink menu is pretty small compared to other boba places, but there's still plenty of options to choose from! You can customize how much ice you want and how sweet you want your drink. You can also sample your drink before you buy it!\n\nI had the green milk tea with boba, 30% sweetness and it was great! The boba could've had more flavor, but it's texture was nearly perfect!\n\nI'd give this place five stars, but unfortunately, my (horrible) date ordered a strawberry smoothie and it wasn't blended all too well. Chunks kept getting stuck in his straw. But let's be honest, he probably deserved it..\n\nI'll be sure to check out the strawberry smoothie next time and ask for it to be extra blended! I'm excited that DaYung exists!
