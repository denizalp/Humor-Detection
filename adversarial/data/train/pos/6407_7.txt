Grrrrr MEAT!!!!\n\nAfter 12 visits in the past year, thought I should pay homage to this incredible restaurant where beef is king.\n\nThe Wagyu beef tartar is incredible and honestly, the only one I have had.  After all why fill up on appetizers when you know a great steak is coming.\n\nAny of their steaks are great.  Sadly, the Japanese kobe is no longer on the menu.  The American version is almost as good.  Regular cuts of USDA prime steaks are also very tasty.  \n\nI have never ordered sides since the portions are large and again, the meat is the focus for me.\n\nThe braised short ribs deserve a special mention. Soft, perfectly glazed.  Wow.\n\nThe wine list is extensive. Prices are good by Vegas standards.\n\nIf you're into single malt scotches, this is the place for you.  Incredible selections.  I actually had the chance to enjoy the Macallan 35 yr old, select reserve 52 yr old from 1946, and the 55 yr old that will take your breath away.  \n\nThe restaurant itself is contemporary but must make mention that the bar is quite dark.  Its funny when they give you a flashlight to see the menu.  I guess they thought my lighter would burn the place down.\n\nIts always busy so make a reservation or eat at an off hour (late).
