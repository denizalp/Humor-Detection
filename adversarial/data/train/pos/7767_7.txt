Pension Babe: Do you like Chinese dessert? Oh wait. Never mind. You think soup is food you only turn to before you eat your dog for survival calories.\n\nMe: [wanting to prolong the date] Oh did you want to go for dessert? My soup-before-eating-your-dog rule only applies to, you know, soup soup. Not Chinese dessert soups. [Thinks wtf is a dessert soup? But I don't care. I just want to spend another 30 minutes with her.]\n\nAnyway, we made our way here. You get a little tick sheet with various dessert-y things I got no clue about.\n\nMe: Hmmm. You trusted me to order Korean. You order me dessert. Just don't tell me what you ordered until I get it.\n\nPension Babe: Okay, one question. Hot or cold?\n\nMe: Cold. [Heads to their good smelling men's bathroom]\n\nPension babe got papaya and mushroom dessert soup. Hot. I was unaware there was such a thing as dessert mushrooms. But then I was unaware a culture had a dessert soup. Pension babe ordered me a mango tapioca kind of cold custardy slushie bowl. Or something. \n\nMe: [tugs her dessert mushroom soup closer] I just want to smell it. It looks like soup you get at Swiss Chalet. [smells soup] That is the most offensive smelling dessert soup ever. I'm offended sitting at a table with a dessert soup that smells that bad.\n\nPension babe: You can go sit on that chair over by the bathroom.
