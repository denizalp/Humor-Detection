I've been wanting to try this place out for a while. It kept popping up on my feed as a place to try and I am always easily swayed by delicious pastries. \n\nThe shop is very cute and the lighting is very romantic. It is small, but not in a congested way. It's cozy and perfect for a snowy night for a warm coffee, a sparkling glass of champagne and a tasty treat. \n\nMy boyfriend treated me to a citron tart and a couple of the macarons for end-of-exams. I was so excited to come. The lady behind the counter gave us really good recommendations and set us up nicely with a very cute silver tray. \n\nThe citron tart is super creamy and the crust is very flaky and has a hint of sweetness. I really enjoyed the contrast of the tart with the sweet crust. It was a little eggy, but overall, super good. \n\nThe macarons were out of this world. They've got the perfect shell and that chewy center you always look for in a good macaron. The flavors were unique (rose and Gianduja). They were absolutely delicious. If I could, I would buy a whole box and probably finish them all within a day. I'm in love! So excited that there's now multiple places for macarons right around the corner from me!
