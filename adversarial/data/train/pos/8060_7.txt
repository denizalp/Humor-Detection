I heard about this place opening up a while back so I had to come and check it out when it opens! Since they've just opened for a few days only they only accept cash at the moment. Their menu is extensive and full of matcha items! I'm already in love from the billions of items to order from! It took some time for me to decide what I wanted but in the end I wanted the Tsujiri Sundae with Matcha ice cream! \n\nA super friendly staff asked everyone in line if they needed assistance with their menu and suggestions! When she approached me I informed her that I knew what I wanted and she was pleasantly surprised! At that same moment I suddenly wanted their O Matcha Macarons as well so I asked her if there were any left since some baked items were sold out! She told me there were a few left and asked me how many I wanted so that she can put them aside for me. Super sweet and considerate!!! I wanted three in total so she quickly packaged them and set them aside while I wait in line. When it was my turn to order the Tsujiri Sundae I was told it's sold out! Oh the two words I didn't want to hear... Luckily the friendly staff member was there so she recommended that I order the Shiratama Sundae with Matcha Ice Cream over the Chiffon Cake Sundae! I took her suggestion and it was AMAZING!! Definitely love the matcha soft serve over Uncle Tetsu's version since this was creamier and flavourful! The Red bean was not overly sweet so it paired very well with the matcha soft serve. The mochi that came with the sundae was just the right amount of chewiness! I also enjoyed their O Matcha Macaron as it was not overly sweet and the texture of the shell was still crispy but chewy inside! \n\nDefinitely returning for more products and the super friendly staff!! Hurry before the line up gets as bad as Uncle Tetsu's!
