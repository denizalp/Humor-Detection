I literally drive by this place all the time! So I'm glad I finally got the chance to give them a try!\n\nMy co-workers and I came here for a team lunch, we had a pretty big group but lucky for us the lunch rush was mostly to-go orders. Whoop! Whoop! \n\nThey have a ton of lunch specials where you get an entree of your choice and two yummy sides.Our waitress was so kind, there was a special of the day and we all had questions about it so she brought out samples for us to try! \n\nI ended up ordering the special, it was like a fried rice with chicken and shrimp with veggies. It was really good! Lucky for me there was a little bit of everything around the table so I already know a few things I'm looking forward to try on my next visit!
