Your average Starbucks located inside of Albertsons to the far left, front of the store. Their counter is smaller than most locations but they still serve up your standard beverages and snacks. Friendly service, drinks taste like they should, and very convenient. Not a bad area with easy parking and not really the type of area that would get too crowded. Not much else to say people, c'mon its Starbucks! \n\nEnjoy!
