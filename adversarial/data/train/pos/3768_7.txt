I came here yesterday with my friend for lunch. He just moved to the area and used to go to this place all the time with his grandparents when he was younger so he was excited to return! \n\nWe got there and were greeted and seated quickly by the friendly hostess.\n\nOur waitress came by a few times to see if we wanted drinks or food but we hadn't made any final decisions yet. I am always torn between at least two meals at restaurants and always ask my server which one they would recommend.\n\nWell when I asked our waitress who's name was Felicia what she recommended- either the shakshuka or the egg salad platter, she looked at me like I committed a crime and said, well they're 2 completely different meals so...\n\nAnd that was it. I kid you not. I felt so uncomfortable I just decided to get the shakshuka so she'd leave. Are you kidding me? Usually servers enjoy telling you what they like, and they may be different but does that mean you don't have a preference? Or for gods sake just name the more expensive one and call it a day!\n\nA very nice waitress names Joey noticed my friend and I were kind of caught off guard and came over. She told me I made a good choice in ordering the shakshuka and even went and got us a sample of the pea soup after we told her we'd never tried it. She was so sweet and came back to our table a few times to see how we were doing. \n\nOur food came pretty quick and my friend and I both bet that Felicia wouldn't even come back to ask how it was. She didn't for a while but when she did she literally said \"how's everything\" and before we could even say \"good\" she had walked away and was already asking the lady at the table next to us. \n\nThe food was amazing by the way! The shakshuka was so delicious and I had a bite of my friends fries and they were heavenly.\n\nWe both ran out of water towards the end of the meal and left the glasses very visible for Felicia to see but nonetheless had to ask her to fill them. She came over with one bill and when we told her it was actually separate she angrily walked away to fix it.\n\nFinally my friend put her to the test and gave her the opportunity to apologize! He asked her if she was having a bad day because she wasn't very nice to us. She simply said, no I'm just working. That was the final straw, let's just say we called Joey over and gave her a well deserved tip.\n\nBye Felicia!
