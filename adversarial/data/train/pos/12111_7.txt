I don't know why someone (M A) would leave a 1 star review for a business simply because they believe others have left fake reviews.  I live at this property and it is very nice and they go above and beyond to keep the residents happy.  Everything is Top Notch, from the gym to the resident hub and pool.  If you are looking at apartments, I highly recommend Liv Ahwatukee.
