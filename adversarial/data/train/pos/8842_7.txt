Ah yes, The Game Depot.  Whenever I walk into a gaming store it brings be back to the good old days when I was a kid playing Dungeons and Dragons.  No, not d20 or version 3.5 or all that newfangled stuff.  I mean the OLD Advanced Dungeons & Dragons with those hard cover books written by Gygax.  Yeah, Greyhawk!  White Plume Mountain!  The Vault of the Drow!  You just killed the gelatinous cube and found 5 platinum pieces!\n\nIf I continue like this, you are going to have to make a saving throw vs. nostalgia at -2 on the die. . .The days of first edition D&D are long gone, but you can find a lot of the modern D&D here in all its glory, along with many other games using boards, tiles, cards, etc.  There's also dice, metal miniatures, and a HUGE gaming area where up to a few dozen people can sit and play any kind of game they desire.  Plus, they've got enough plastic building and ground models to accommodate ANY kind of history, fantasy, or strategy play.\n\nAWESOME gaming store.  While they don't carry the books and modules to make this aging fuddy duddy happy, at least they've got the space to sit down and get rollin'
