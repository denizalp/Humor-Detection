One word summary: abysmal. \n\nWow, where do I begin. I came here for Sunday brunch with my parents based on the good reviews, and I can't even begin to express my disappointment. \n\nThings started out fine. Our server, Jenny, seemed nice enough. She took our order quickly. I ordered the garden frittata, mom the beach benedict w\/ home fries, and dad the american bistro breakfast.\n\nFood comes. Mom's beach benedict comes with hash browns instead of home fries. It's also missing the star ingredient: avocado. We tell Jenny, and she says...\n\n\"Oh, sorry the kitchen menu is different than the customer menu. Sometimes dishes come out slightly different than what the menu says.\"\n\nI almost burst out laughing from shock and amazement. Um, WHAT!? Do you realize what you just told us, Jenny!? I'm guessing our dropped jaws were her signal to go back to the kitchen and make things right. She comes back out with a little plate of avocado and then says...\n\n\"The kitchen doesn't cook home fries until after 11am, sorry about that,\" then walks away.\n\nIsn't this the kind of thing you should tell us when we ORDER the food?\n\nMy garden frittata was really just 2 over-medium eggs with chopped veggies on top. Please do not call that a frittata. \n\nAfter we got our check and gave them a credit card to pay, I realized I had a 10% off coupon. I told Jenny when she got back, but she said they couldn't apply it since they had already run the credit card. I understand it's a bit of a pain in the butt, but it's not impossible to void the transaction and then recalculate the bill. And considering her appalling service thus far, it was the least she could have done.\n\nGet you ish together, guys.
