I used to think LA got one of the Best Ramen places in town.  Opinions changed!!\n\nMonta Noodle House for now got the BEST Tonkotsu Ramen Soup in town! \n\nI have tried the famous Ramen shop in LA, SF, and NYC.  This one is no doubt the  BEST.  Thick creamy soup with bald flavors.  Although I am not the fan of thin noodles but they managed to cook it right (Shinsengumi Hataka Ramen in Gardena can not get it right, so does the famous Ippudo in NYC).  I also LOVED their nitamago (soft broiled egg).  YUMMY (Look at the business photo that I placed)\n\nThis place is now on my official \"Must Visit\" place when coming to Sin City.  So Good!$!#$!$!  and they also accept credit cards :D
