VIBE\nI love that this store has a vintage yet modern look at the same time. The service and owner here are amazing. He truly makes you feel like you're at home. \n\nTHE GOODS \nIf you're looking for some swank vintage, this is the place to be. The store specializes in vintage wedding dresses. They just look so gorgeous! \n\nDownstairs, is mens and lingerie. That seems to fit,non?  \nAlso, the mannequin downstairs is creepy! I felt like it was looking at me and moving its eyes. I swear! \n\nOBLIGATORY CATCHY REMARK\nKick up those legs and get to Cabaret! Because you can-can.
