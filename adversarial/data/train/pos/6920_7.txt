\"I always say, 'Eat clean to stay fit; have a burger to stay sane.'\" â€• Gigi Hadid\n\nYas, Gigi.  Yaaas!\n\nI don't know a single person that doesn't like In-N-Out.  They're affordable, delicious, and also comes out hot and steamy.  Sure, their fries are junky but I just go to In-N-Out for their cheeseburgers anyways.  As Chrissy Teigen once stated in an interview, \"The In-N-Out burger over any other burger, but I will take McDonald's fries.\"  Truth.  I will say that getting their fries Animal Style does help a little.  Get some extra Spread Sauce, a side of peppers, and enjoy! And that hot chocolate? Well it's Ghirardelli powdered cocoa mix and hot water. For $1-something, what more do you want?  Get your bougie cocoa elsewhere. \n\nI like this location. They're fast, friendly, and it's a clean location despite how insanely busy it gets.  The drive-thru is never an issue either.
