I need to start of buy saying that I only had two things at the place, may be not enough to make a full review but here it goes. \n\nI had a Long Island iced tea and the hostess recommended the fried chocolate. When my server came by, she took my order and brought the drink out first. The island ice tea was weak at best, tasteless, and dilute in a full cup of ice! The cup was full of ice so the actual drink was maybe a quarter of the cup if that. \n\nThe fried chocolate, OMG! Where do I start with that! It is a deep fried Indian style naan bread, covers with powdered cinnamon, chocolate, caramel syrup, whipped cream, and two scoops of vanilla ice cream. The only edible part of this sinful atrocity was the ice cream. The naan bread was absolutely terrible! And what made the whole thing worse is all the powder cinnamon it made me caught and gag! Do these people not know that cinnamon cannot be digested?! \n\nNow this is a sport bar so I realize food is probably not their forte, however, this dessert came with a recommendation form the hostess. It is best to stick with the alcohol and sports at this place.
