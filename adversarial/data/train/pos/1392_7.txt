The bartenders and dj were great. No girls showed up to dance so the bartender had to dance. Granted she did fantastic on the pole. We asked to talk to management but he was a coward and too afraid to come talk to us. All he had to say was sorry the girls were taking too long to the other guys who also left and had been there 30 min while we waited over an hour and half for entertainment. Highly disappointed since we had been her prior and had been pleased with the entertainment.
