Well folks, they finally embraced today's technology and got a conveyer belt to carry those massively heavy toboggans up the stairs for you.  I thought they were just heavy because the last time I went, I was a tweenager.  But, I went as an (out of shape) adult and they were just as heavy as I remembered.  \nSo, YOU my friend, will not have to deal with that and maybe get more than a couple of runs in.  ENJOY!\n\nAlso, they have a bomb snack bar.  Fried pickles!  Quesadilla Rolls!  All the new trendy apps!  Of course its 2 or 3 teenage what seem to be volunteers working it, so you might wait a little while.  But, it's warm inside.
