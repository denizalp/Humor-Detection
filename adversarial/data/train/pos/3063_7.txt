For those of you tasked with planning a Bachelor Party - Good luck! Although I been to Montreal a few times before, it is certainly very hard to plan a eventful weekend in a place where you know nothing about. This is where Montreal Nitelife comes in. I dealt with Adriano and he was a gentlemen and a scholar. He knew exactly where to go and gave solid recommendations for day time activities as well as the night time entertainment.\n\nEverything was very organized and I would definitely recommend this service for those looking to get that VIP experience. Everywhere we went, Adriano pretty much knew the people there. He'll definitely take care of you and your group. He managed to snag us a RSVP to Joe Beef which was booked out for 3 months in advance and I only gave him like 3 days in advance.\n\nAdriano kept in touch throughout our entire stay and made sure we were taken care of. This man deserves a raise!\n\nI'll definitely be using this service the next time I come back, bachelor party or not!
