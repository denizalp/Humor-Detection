Wow the guy here was not helpful. He couldn't tell the difference between eSATA and IDE when I showed him the IDE hard drive I was holding. He kept trying to convince me that the hard drive was eSATA. The laptop the hard drive came out of  was manufactured before eSATA was even on the market!\n\nTheir technician doesn't work weekends, which really isn't surprising. So unless you know exactly what you're looking for, don't bother with this place on the weekend.\n\nOn a side note: Why do computer repair shops always look so disheveled? They're trying to push new technology so shouldn't the stores look modern?
