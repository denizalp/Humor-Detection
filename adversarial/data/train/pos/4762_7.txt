Zipped in, with no line on this past Saturday, only to be met with Captain Attitude with dreadlocks. Captain Richard Head was severely lacking in customer service skills, he was very rude, and took about 15 minutes to find my registered mail.\n\nThe girl next to him, who was too busy trying to hide her Facebook surfing, couldn't be bothered to try to help either.\n\nIt's no surprise that USPS is constantly in the hole and losing money.
