This place hasn't changed in over 20 years, I swear!\n\nIts a very basic (and old\/in need up updating) classic roller rink.\nIf you grew up in the McKeesport\/White Oak\/North Versailles area, it would be \"home\", but if you're an Outsider, it borders on dumpy.\n\nPROS:\nSkate and Rollerblades for rental (blades are limited).\nLimited concession stand type of basic food sold;\nGreat fun for kids (and adults, as long as you don't have a stick up your pooper);\nGreat for kids' parties\n\nCONS:\nIn desperate need of a remodel and updating;\nSkates provided for rental are a little \"beat\";\nDid I mention that it badly needs a remodel?\nIf you're going for a party, the parking can get ugly.\nThe stairway leading to the rink is odd, but a local chunk of nostalgia.
