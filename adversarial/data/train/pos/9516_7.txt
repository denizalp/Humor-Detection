I now use the word \"Hakkasan\" as a adjective when describing douche bag events.  Like for example, if someone cut you off in line, you'd say, \"Don't be such a Hakkasan, asshole!\"\n\nNow let me begin my night.  Stood in line for 2 hours.  During this crappy wait, they opened another line, for people who were stupidly willing to pay double the cover charge. Hakkasan!  So happy I didn't.  Granted I made friends with a cool dude from L.A., I ended up taking my heels off while in line.  By the time we got into our rat cage of a club, I was really over it.  Had to climb stairs, that you'd find in any building in the emergency stairwell.  Except, these are all black, dimly lit for your falling pleasure.\n\nLadies (and some men), wearing heels isn't the smartest idea.  Unless you are willing to fork over $3k for some VIP tables, your ass is standing up the whole night.  There's nowhere for you to sit down.  Due to waiting in line so long, I was thirsty, and not in the drunken whore kind of way, like I want H2O.  The bartender serves us water in a half glass, filled with ice to the brim, for get this $5.  It's tap water!!!!!!!!!  Hakkasan!\n\nThe club, didn't really get to enjoy it much, because by the time we paid our cover, this place should not have allowed for us to enter.  It was packed beyond capacity.  People almost walking all over each other.  I was afraid of dying in the hallways where the elevators are located.  You can't walk, you are pushed and it's scary being in heels and dehydrated.  Those Hakkasan clubbers don't care, they just want their beats while on E.  The main room is super awesome to the eye, but I just couldn't get a chance to enjoy it's glory.  Over packed to the brim.  \n\nThis club is too much, if you have the stamina, best of luck to you.  As for me, never again!  Hakkasan!
