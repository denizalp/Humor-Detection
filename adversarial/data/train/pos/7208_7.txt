After hearing decent reviews about Pinot Brasserie's involvement with Restaurant Week, we decided to check out their lunch menu the past Sunday.\n\nAs we approached the hostess, she asked if we were there for Restaurant Week (which we were), and gave us a seat inside.  (In retrospect, I wish I had asked for a seat in the 'outside' area so we could have access to the pedestrian area.  The front room we were seated in reminded me of someone's dining room.  After taking our orders and getting our beverages, hot bread rolls and cold butter arrived a few minutes later.\n\nStarter:\n* Onion Soup Gratinee \"Baguette, Gruyere cheese\" - The Husband and I both chose this dish to start, since the other options were both salads.  The cheesy goodness from the Gruyere cheese really makes this dish.  Otherwise it's just onions and bread in a broth.\n\nEntree:\n* Croque Monsieur \"Ham, Gruyere cheese, Creme Fraiche\" - This is what I had initially ordered.  But the neighboring table got an order of the Linguini Pasta and I could smell the wonderful garlic scent rising from her dish.  I was immediately enchanted and wished to change my order.  (Thank goodness it was before the soup had arrived, so the waitress was able to make the change.)\n\n* Linguini Pasta \"Mussels, Littleneck Clams, white wine broth\" - When the waiter placed the dish in front of me, I waited for the steam bath of garlic to envelope me.  It didn't.  I took a big whiff and I could hardly smell any garlic.  It also looked a bit less than that neighboring party's dish.  Hmmm...As I started to separate the mussels and clams from their shells, I took a bite of my pasta.  Pretty heavy on the white wine broth and not much else is what my final thoughts were.  I found myself putting pats of butter into the dish to give it more flavor.  It was just okay, not something I would order again.\n\n* Roasted Chicken \"Tarragon-sherry jus, Pinot Garlic Fries\" - A generous portion size for lunch, I was surprised that The Husband went this route since we're not fond of the dry chicken problem.  He really thought it would be different here.  The chicken laid on a bed of mushrooms which had a heavy wine sauce.  In the end, the chicken was dry, especially the breast section.  (He learned his lesson.)  The side of fries were good, although we had to ask for a dipping sauce.\n\nDessert:\n* Chocolate Croissant Pudding \"With Wild Turkey Sauce\" - Unfortunately, they were already out of this dessert by 1 pm.\n\n* Creme Brulee \"Burnt custard\" - Dessert took awhile, and at least it was worth waiting for.  They do their creme brulee very nicely here.  A large service area for the burnt sugary top, a nice texture and taste, and a satisfying dessert overall.\n\nService was decent, nothing exceptional though.  Things took a lot longer than we felt necessary, and I'm not sure if it's because they purposely want you to have a leisurely meal or if they just run slower.  I did notice that not everyone was offered the Restaurant Week lunch menu option, which does make me wonder why.
