i've pondered about this review for the longest time.  i'll be nice and go 3-stars.  my second stay here was definitely better than my first (where our room wasn't ready until 2 hours after we checked in).  yes, this is one of the newest hotels on the strip so everyone wants to stay here.  all the glitz...glam...bars...clubs.  yeah, it's all there.  but it's just all too snoody for me.  i don't like feeling out of place, and the cosmopolitan definitely makes me feel that way.  don't expect to find a table with less than a $25 minimum, even on off-peak hours.\n\nfor such a nice hotel, it's strange to me that there aren't any high end shops here.  but it's connected to the crystals shopping court inside aria so maybe that's why.  the walk next door was pretty convenient.  \n\nthe parking structure tells you how many spots there are on each level, and those red\/green lights above each spot to tell you where the availability is.  pretty helpful.\n\nboth times we stayed in the suites (aka terrace studio), which are pretty nice and spacious.  i'm sure the regular rooms are nice too.  i'm just glad both trips were free.  i wouldn't pay (or allow anyone i'm with to pay) to stay here.\n\npsst....go find the secret pizza place (open late night only) on the 3rd floor next to the pool tables.  the line was uber long so we didn't try it, but i'm kinda curious how it tastes.  though i guess that late at night, when everyone's drunk, anything tastes good.
