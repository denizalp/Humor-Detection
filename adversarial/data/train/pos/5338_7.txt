I went there on Sunday to pick out trees and shrubs after I purchased the beginner package at the home show. The staff was not helpful at all and directed me to the shrubs and that's about it. No one was around for answering questions or so forth. Plus the fact that most of the shrubs looked dead. I left and went to the moon valley nursery on Indian school and let me tell you what a difference!! I would recommend the Indian School location over this location any time.
