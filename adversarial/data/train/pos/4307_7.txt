I love this school.  They are so good to my children.  The teachers are so patient and polite. I love that they focus on teaching life-lessons.  The things our kids will need for the rest of their life, whether it is sharing,  playing well with others or handling a situation when someone does something you do not like.  My son told me yesterday that we walk away when someone is being mean.  It was great, at home he wants to agrue with his sister that she is mean.  Hopefully soon we will see this change here too.
