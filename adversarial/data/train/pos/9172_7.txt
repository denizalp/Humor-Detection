All I can say is...WOW. We had the most incredible buying experience at Mark Mitsubishi of Phoenix this past weekend. The sales team is not pushy at all and the prices are the lowest in the Valley when we compared the vehicles that we were looking at. \n\nWe *thought* we were in the market for a certified pre-owned 2016 Honda Pilot EX-L and found one through Auto Trader that was located at Mark Mitsubishi of Phoenix. When we arrived to look at it, we were kindly greeted by Bob. He walked over to the car with us to chat about it. In person, the car had more scratches than I liked {I'm SUPER picky when it comes to purchasing used cars...lets be honest, they basically have to look new}. \n\nBUT staring at us from across the lot was a GORGEOUS 2015 White Lexus GX460. I jokingly said to my husband, \"what about this one?\". With a giggle, knowing that it was way out of our reach! Well, little did I know, it actually wasn't as far out of our reach as I had thought. I told my husband that it was my dream \"mom car\" in 10+ years. And he said, well then, lets look at it! Why not get your dream car now? ***KEEPER***. ;) \n\nWe took it for a spin, and YUP, it was everything that we wanted and more. It had the towing capacity and truck-like feel that my husband wanted, and the luxury feel that I wanted. We were smitten. As we were pulling back into the lot, I saw another one! This one was a black 2014 GX460, in even BETTER condition than the 2015 and the exact same body style. It literally looked brand new, inside and out. And i'm a sucker for black. It was also more affordable since it had a few more miles on it and was one year older. Well needless to say, we left that day totally unsure about what we wanted. The Lexus put the pilot to shame. {No offense, Honda, I still love you!} We came home and did a TON of research on the Lexus GX460s and literally could not get it out of our head. They body style and features had not changed much between 2014-2017 and there really were no big differences between the years. \n\nSo, I called up Bob and asked to come back and test drive the black one. Good thing, because they had sold the white one previously that afternoon!! Fast forward a few hours and we are now proud owners of a gorgeous Lexus SUV! :) The purchasing process was seamless, they definitely worked with us to meet our monthly budget, and they offered a 50K mile\/4 year full luxury warranty AND Gap Insurance which are key when purchasing a pre-owned vehicle. We're in love! We can't stop staring at it. \n\nThank you, Bob, and the entire MM of Phoenix team for making our buying experience SO seamless. Bob even called us this morning to thank us for our business and to see if there was anything else that he could do for us. We would highly recommend this dealership for any of your purchasing needs!
