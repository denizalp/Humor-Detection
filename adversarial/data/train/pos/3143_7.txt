The perfect meal\n\nI've read the reviews.  I've seen the pictures.  I've heard the stories.  Now it was time for me to try the hyped and well reviewed wagyu skirt steak.  And it was magic.  I can definitely say it was the best steak I've eaten.  More tender than any filet I've ever had and richer than any ribeye.  My wife loved it so much that she legitimately got steak drunk.\n\nWe're not usually a dessert ordering couple, but the steak was so damn amazing I thought I'd roll the dice on the toffee monkey bread and brown sugar sour cream ice cream.  Again, it was magic.  I loved it.  I got a bit full towards the end, but soldiered on because it would be unpatriotic to waste a bite of this food.\n\nFood aside, we loved the staff.  Everyone was so incredibly friendly and helpful.  The busser who bagged our left overs even threw in extra rolls in case we wanted to make sandwiches.  Those little details make all the difference.  \n\nThe perfect meal does come with a hefty price tag, but it was well worth it for the overall experience.  I'll do this meal every time I'm in Vegas.  \n\nDo yourself a favor and make a reservation here.  I have yet to find a nice steakhouse anywhere that even comes close to the overall experience you get at Craftsteak.
