Not the best No Frills in the city but not the worst either. About par for the neighbourhood. It's small and stocks only the essentials. There is no dollar store or deli here. If you have a car you're better off heading east to the No Frills at Gerrard Square. Adjacent to a Shoppers Drug Mart and various sketchbags.\n\nObligatory Title Pun: More like NO thrills.\n\nMenu Readability: n\/a\n\nNeed to mention: You CANNOT take the carts into the parking lot. You can only go a few feet out of the store before you are barricaded. Plan for this.\n\nWhat this place teaches me about myself: You can take the frills about of the man, but you can't take the man out of the frills.
