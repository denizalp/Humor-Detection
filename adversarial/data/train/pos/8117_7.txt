Ok, I don't have much to say here except we called last night and were told to call at 8am this morning. Only to be informed there is not a Doctor on call. ?????? Isnt this, this companies business. And why are people so rude today when challenged about their mistakes??\n\nThis is a blurb from THEIR website.\n\nIn the Ottawa area, house calls are carried out weekday evenings, weekends and holidays. * Evening hours 5 pm-11 pm * Weekend hours vary * Requests for house calls Mon-Sun 8 am-11 pm\n\nService Description: Does not provide medical or other health care services but acts only as a referral service. All requests for medical house calls are referred to private independent doctors. \n\nWhen you need a doctor to visit your home in the case of a non-emergency situation, they provide the following services: Caring physicians making house calls * same-day service * copy of medical report on request * prescriptions called in to your pharmacy on request..\n\nIf they dont have a doctor what is their purpose in life?
