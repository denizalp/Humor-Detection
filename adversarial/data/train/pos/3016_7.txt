I would love to write a review on the food but after our hour + wait to get in, when we were told 40 minutes.  We have now been sitting in our booth for an hour.  My coffee I initially did not get after ordering,  and my second refill took 30 minutes after asking twice.  We have to much time invested into leaving now but... Damn this really is not the way to have people bring in the New Year... Oh and the hostess was extremely sarcastic and rude when we asked how much longer after an hour had passed.  Great now an espn camera crew is in the kitchen .. Wonder if they are eating my food... Forget breakfast, I should have ordered dinner..... Still waiting and I even finished writing this review.... 1 hope 15 min in and still waiting on food...
