Filiberto's is my favorite Mexican food chain in the valley. This newly opened store lives up to the Filiberto's name. I get the breakfast burrito often. This consists of scrambled egg, peppers, onions, cheese and your choice of ham, sausage, bacon, or chorizo. All this wrapped in an enormous flour tortilla served steaming hot. I mean you can't pick it up with your bare hands hot. The condiment bar offers red and green sauce. not too spicy with a good flavor. The sauces compliment the food very well. \nThere are a lot of copycats around the valley. I've never been to any of those other \"Berto\" restaurants because I'm completely satisfied with Filiberto's price and quality.
