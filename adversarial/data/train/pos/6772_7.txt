Got a hot tip that Bang Bang will be the new ice cream kings and queens in the city so I thought I would check them out for myself. While they haven't officially opened yet (they've soft launched but are still confirming their full launch date) I was able to sneak in for a Lemon Meringue ice cream sandwich on a Ginger Snap cookie. I'm not understating when I saw it was perfect. Not too cold, not too sweet, not too lemony, the cookie was just moist enough to be soft yet crunchy. Perfect.\n\nThe story; Roseanne, of Bakerbots fame, has opened up a new spot on Ossington with her brother who just happens to make amazing ice cream. That's right, all the goodness of Bakerbots, now with ice cream! They're planning on a full launch in the nearish future so be sure to keep an eye on that store front window. If you're lucky, like I was, you can come away with a more than reasonably priced pound (yes, I said pound) of delicious ice cream for the trip home. Don't forget to buy more to eat at home.
