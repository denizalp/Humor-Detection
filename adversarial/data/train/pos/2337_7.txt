Matthew has really helped us out.  I have never had desert landscaping and he knew what every single one of those plants were.  Of course he could have just been making things up that sounded Latin, hmm.  Just kidding, he's kept our yard looking great.  He also helped us at the nursery when we needed to buy new plants.  I would have chosen everything wrong for the sun and heat.  The yard is always evolving so we look forward to working with Matthew for a long time into the future.
