Don't know if it was bad timing but this place was slower than a herd of snails traveling through peanut butter.  \n\nThis might be because they had (3) people working not \"Five\" as the name dictates. However, the gentlemen who was taking the orders was professional and showed composure. Luckily I ordered when no one was there because a line of nine souls quickly formed.  Took thirty- four minutes for my Little Bacon Cheeseburger w\/ lettuce, tomato, onion(raw) and A1 sauce.  Of course fires and of course, I regretted it because they give you so much.  But, I guess some people like that.  \n\nBurger was good. Bacon was great. Although I really don't get why people like this place so much.  It's not worth the price and I don't see the value proposition.
