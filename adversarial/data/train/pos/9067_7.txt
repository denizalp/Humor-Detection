This place had me at cheese & bacon covered tater tots.\n\nNeeding to get the hell out of the office early yesterday, I joined a co-worker for happy hour at the Temple Bar.  It was my first time here, and I guarantee you that it will not be my last.  Great ambiance in the place, with a massive patio that comes complete with plenty of areas to sit, a beanbag toss game and even \"outdoor\" seating at the bar.  You can't beat that.  Plenty of great beers on draft, ranging from your standard macro-brews to some obscure German beers as well.\n\nWhat will definitely keep me coming back (other than the cute waitresses that were there) are the happy hour specials.  Half-price on pretty much every appetizer that they have, and $3 draft beers.  We inhaled a couple orders of the sliders (which were amazing) and an order of the aforementioned cheese & bacon covered tater tots.  Solid.  I was told that the wings are damn good here as well, and other options on the menu that looked stellar that I will try next time were BBQ ribs and sauteed Cajun shrimp.\n\nIf you are in the Northern Scottsdale area and need to get out of the office for happy hour or swing by a place for an after-golf drink, this is the place for you.
