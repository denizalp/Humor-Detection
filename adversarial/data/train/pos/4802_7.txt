This place is my FAVORITE breakfast joint! I would probably frequent it more often but it's quite the drive for me. I could dream about their california scramble! My hubby loves the biscuits and gravy. I actually think it has more pepper than necessary. I think they're pancakes are amazing and even if you take them home and warm them up the next morning they hold their texture and taste! There is only one bad thing about this place: the staff is all 70lb teenage girls which can be annoying because they seem to be in quite the hurry to turn tables oh! and don't expect them to refill your coffee, water, or anything else once they've taken your payment. All that being said I crave their food it's by far the best breakfast I've had in AZ!
