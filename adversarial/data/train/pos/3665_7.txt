Great breakfasts served by a super friendly staff. My daughter and I both ordered egg dishes which were fabulous. The super friendly waitress was so pumped up on their pancakes of the day she brought us out one to try. A bit to sweet for my tasting but she gets an A++ for her enthusiasm and salesmanship. I look forward to my next visit.
