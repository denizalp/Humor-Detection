The Float waiting room is equipped with water, tea, Himalayan Salt Lamps, gentle music, possibly most important they have a restroom because there is a $500 fee if you pee in the water. I decided not to pee, save some Tubman's.\n The inner waiting room has Zen coloring books, colored pencils, sketch pads, crack your own geodes for sale, and the Himalayan Salt Lamps are for sale as well.\n Jonah got me all set up, watched a rather entertaining video, and showered, then slipped into a body temp pool of 1200 lbs of Epsom Salts.\n I closed the pod, and realized how hard it is for me to relax. The first ten minutes music played, then silence. Dark. Relaxation.\n It. Was. Awesome.\n I'll be back a couple times in the coming weeks, and I'll update if I see a difference. I know it felt incredible. \nCan't wait to do it again!
