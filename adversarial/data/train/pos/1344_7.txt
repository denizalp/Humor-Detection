I have been here a couple of times now.  From the grand opening to several pit stops on my way home.  I can't believe it has taken years for a one stop, best price liquor stop to open in this part of the valley.  TW&M has always been a top tier experience for me where ever I have gone.  This location is the same, same.\n\nThe sights and smells upon entry are incredible.  It's foot print is easy to navigate.  The staff is helpful and will guide you to whatever you are looking for.\n\nTotal Wine and more ROCKS!!
