like a mini hip hop video when u walk in there on a Fri or sat night. pick up some drinks, get followed by the popo,  bump into cousin ray ray and the homies from the old block, score some numbers, listen to some bass-blasting beats in the parking lot-turned club and do an impromptu dance. this lcbo has everything you like including a clearance aisle (a gift from the LCBO gods).  \n\nbut don't come in on a weekend night expecting some fast staff help.  all u will get is the rent-a-cop staring you down. after 20min you may be able to steal a cashier away from the vultures but prepare to lock them down cuz your time is limited. in other words, know what you want, go in, buy it, and get the heck outta that zoo.
