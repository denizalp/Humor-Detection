Tried this with a girlfriend and was blown away by the quality of the food.  We started at the bar with drinks, and the cocktails were fantastic--hand-muddled basil, a terrific old-fashioned, some great martinis.  Then we moved to dinner in the dining room.  Both of us had burgers, and the meat was ground fresh that morning.  Probably the best burger I've had in ages--it was so moist and juicy.  I got the bacon cheeseburger (and I rarely get cheeseburgers, but I knew this one would be good) and it was just delectable.  Before this, I would've said my favorite burger was at Fran's, but I think this surpassed it.  My friend got her burger medium rare, but it was so fresh we weren't even worried about the meat quality.  Then the owner came around and talked to us--very charming.  And the wine pours were impressive!\n\nI'd go back in a heartbeat.  It's not in my neighborhood--it's in Cotswold, and I'm in Dilworth--but I'll move around for that food.  And I thought the prices seemed incredibly reasonable.  Yes, yes, yes.
