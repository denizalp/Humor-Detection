I had a 90-min reflexology and massage package: 70-min therapeutic massage and 20-min ion foot detox. \n\nThe massage was fine, not great but still just fine but here's my complaint. When I came out they take me to the front desk where my masseuse and the manager are standing there and hand me a board and I'm suppose to mark how good it was and the corresponding tip amount which they have already set according to how good the massage was, starting at $10. ($10 average, $15 good, $20 good like that). So I won't mark the stupid board and instead had her $10 and say thank you very much. So she gives me this look of disappointment because she wants more money. \n\nThey make a big public spectacle out of the tip to pressure you. You have NO CHOICE, you must tip them. I don't mind tipping of my own free will but I don't accept being forced to tip and they set the amounts.\n\nI will NEVER go back to this place because of this ridiculous tip system in which they demand that you tip them and it had better be a big tip alright!
