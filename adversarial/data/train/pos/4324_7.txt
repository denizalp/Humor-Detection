I'm glad that I have another convenient location to visit for Amelie's! \n\nAs always the decor is fresh, French and fabulous.  Big enough that you don't feel crowded and plenty of space to spread out.  As always, seats and plug spaces are at a premium for people who like to work in coffee shops!\n\nI tried the Caf√© marcotte?  I'm not sure if that's the exact spelling, but the punch of espresso mellowed with the caramel and sea salt was delicious.  \n\nCan wait to go again soon!
