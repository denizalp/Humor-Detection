I didn't know the existence of Dear & Fro until a friend of mine told me about it. It's hard to spot in a plaza with colorful signs like coco and snowtime. If you ever had snowtime, or cups, it's a similar but different concept. It's shaved ice still, but instead of layering the flavour with the ice,the ice itself is flavoured.\n\nIt's a medium sized dessert store with very cute decors. You feel girlier than you usually are (to the guys that come here, I'm sorry if you feel that way lol!). It's a very instagram-able, snapchat-able place. \n\nYou order in the front, and take one of those  vibrating disks back to your table. It will vibrate and make a sound when your dessert is ready for pickup in the front. The size of the bingsoo is significantly smaller compared to places like snowtime and cups. I personally don't ever finish the bingsoo at snowtime and cups,so this sizing is perfect for me. I love the flavoured shaved ice because it makes my life easier - you don't need to mix any layers. The \"cheese\" that comes with the bingsoo in the particular section tastes interesting..but I love the texture..it's addicting!
