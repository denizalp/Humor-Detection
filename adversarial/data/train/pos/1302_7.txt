I really enjoy the Arcadia area and its many little hidden patio dining spots. Ranch House Grille is a family home breakfast\/lunch eatery that serves up Southwestern-style comfort food. It's in a nice location with a great shaded patio area. I found the staff warm and welcoming. The food wasn't bad (about 4 out of 5) and the portion sizes were great. I ordered the Chicken Fried Steak and Eggs and enjoyed a quiet morning here. I would for sure stop in again.
