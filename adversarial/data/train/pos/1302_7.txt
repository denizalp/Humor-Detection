I'm by no means a phô expert, hell, I barely discovered the dish 2 years ago, and I've always got the same exact thing. But as far as the phô I have eaten, from Texas to Vegas to (now) Phoenix, this place is legit. \n\nTucked in to one of the sketchiest shopping centers in town, complete with dudes walking car to car asking for money, abandoned buildings and homeless people getting a late morning nap in, you'll find this gem of a phô place. But don't let the location fool you, this place is legit, and stays packed! I'm talking like standing room only kinda packed. From locals to passers by, families just leaving church and coworkers on lunch break, this place stays packed. \n\nVery big menu, and all the staples of phô you'd expect. They even have that ever so delicious Thai tea! Everything is very affordable too. Good food and good prices. \n\nThis place is phô real, mayne.
