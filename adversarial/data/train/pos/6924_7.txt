Came here on a Friday evening with a friend who had been given the tickets. Was a decent distance away from the stage (row S). Far enough to see everything but not too close either. \n\nSimply said, this show is quite random. For those who know a bit about chinese history or what not, you'd have a few \"wtf?\" and facepalm moments. \n\nThe weirdest thing, upon arriving at the venue of Palazzo Theatre, is the FLAT FACED PANDAS ! what the heck? why are they so flat faced? D: SO WEIRD ! nice decor aside from that. \n\nDuring the show, you'd have like monkey king to white snake to terra cotta warriors or what not... what the random D: story wise, i was a bit lost lol XD\n\nTo me, not a show i'd pay for. It was funny and entertaining in a way, but i was quite confused for a lot of the show Lol....
