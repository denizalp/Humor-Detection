Well it's my first time trying this place. hubby has always been mentioning to how he wants to bring me to this place one day. So, finally I get to try it! \nI like the concept of grab how many that you can LOL :-D\nit's fun to just put how many you want in your plate or should I say bowl! haha. So you get to choose what you want for your stir fry- they have all kinds of meat, beef, chicken, pork..and they have cod fish too which is good! \nSo what I did was, I put all but beef haha!  \nand of course there's different veggies to throw in. You get to choose the kind of sauce you want..I like mine super spicy! \nand the last part is for them to cook it for you which is so much fun to watch watch. Hubby went crazy and over loaded his bowl and when the time for them to cook it, they ended up having to grab 2 bowls soon as they're done cooking for him! haha Yeah, he's not very hungry that time LOL ^_^\nI also like the unlimited rice,soups, drinks and frozen yogurt.\nWe really had a great dinner here and we are surely coming back again! Highly recommended! Come here and give it try and you'll surely love it!
