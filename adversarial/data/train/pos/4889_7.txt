Jean Phillipe? NAH, Jean-Paul!\n\nOver the years, French bakeries on the Strip have become less enticing where flavor has fallen flat. Manon is privately-owned where the food is the star and not the name on the store-front. Chef Jean-Paul and his wife Rachel are the owners of Manon which they named after one of their daughters. And I consider this place to be one of the best French pâtisseries outside of France.\n\nMACARONS: At the heart of every French bakery lies a macaron. As soon as you enter the store, you're greeted by a case filled with mountains of colorful confectioneries. No matter what flavors you choose, each macaron will be identical in size with a flawless finish. And no complaints here on cookie:filling ratio. At $1 a pop, they're a steal! A fraction of the cost of Ladurée, more accessible, and equal in taste. \n\nSAVORY: You can keep it under $10! If I worked in the area, I'd probably be here everyday for lunch. There's a sweet lunch combo: soup, sandwich, drink all for $9. But offering to buy me me a spinach or escargot quiche (yeah, I said snails) would be an easy way to get me on a date.\n\nEverything is so delicious, I need more excuses to eat at Manon! If you'd like to try, Manon is located in the Roy's\/Fleming's shopping center across from Boca Park.
