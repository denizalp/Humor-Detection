I'm not a drinker, but my guilty pleasure is bar food. So, anytime Diners Drive-ins and Dives features a local spot, then I'm obligated to give it a try. \n\nMy first visit was a few years back and I was not impressed. A few of my friends frequent Four Kegs, so I decided to give them another chance to redeem themselves.\n\nThe place was still as smokey as I remember. For my to go order, you pay at the bar then proceed to a room that should be limited to employees only. \n\nThe Sicilian pizza was hard and disgusting. I even tried to improve it's flavor with ranch. Ranch usually makes everything taste better.Their cajun fries were recommended, so we had that too. It seemed like they took soggy fries and dumped hot sauce all over. Their chicken fingers and fried zucchini are the only reasonable options. \n\nI know this place is a local institution, but it's not for me. Everything is not for everybody.
