It was ok! My nail polish is bumpy and all over the place\/on my skin. Looks like a 2 year old did them. It would be nice if she listened to me when I repeatedly told her to get a certain spot with the callus remover, she kept ignoring me. She didn't even file my nails or buff them.\n\nThey employees dress with shorts half an inch below their butts and their cleavage all out.\n\nOn top of it all.... I had to hear the employee next to my chair give a lecture on how Christmas isn't real and the history of its origin... Enough said? I think!!!
