Those who know Primo know that I'm the risk-taking, living-on-the-edge gambler type, the sort your mom warned you against, the sort that has no problem letting strange barbers take their razor and scissors to my head with nothing but a Yelp recommendation for safety and comfort. \n\nThat's why, when I found myself in dire need of a haircut while on business in Scottsdale-Phoenix, I ended up in the very competent, very talented, and very hilarious hands of the father and son duo that run this follicle trimmery a couple of blocks from the W Hotel where I was staying. \n\nThe shop has the clubby feel of a man cave, with plush leather chairs, baseball memorabilia on the walls, and tvs tuned to The Fugitive (love that movie!). The experience was replete with mild racist, ageist and misogynist humor, the sort that sets apart an established shop from the crappy corporate owned chains whose sole intention is to upsell unnecessary products. At Shaving Grace, on the other hand, the only thing being sold aside from an excellent haircut is an old-world, graceful experience, and Primo now has a new go-to barber in Phoenix. \n\nHighly recommended.
