My hubby and I visit this theater a lot and have been every week the last month or so on Monday's. They have $5.00 movie Monday's and have added a deal at the concession stand for a medium popcorn and small soda for $5. This is a great deal however is becoming a mad house now that more people are learning of this great deal.\n\nOur last visit sucked sour ass as the movie was 25 minutes late starting then once it started the curtains were still partially closed cutting off the movie screen and the lights were on. People in the crowd were not happy at all and this was a full house on top of it. The theater seats were packed, we were lucky to snag the last four seats together as my hubby and I invited our friends another couple to join us that day.\n\nAlso the put a new release (The Purge) in the smallest theater they have which was lame because everyone and their granny's were there to see this movie. In fact every row in the front were taken and that is rare because those seats suck as they are too close to the screen.\n\nA theater employee did come in prior to the movie starting to apologize after people went out to complain as to why the movie was not starting. A lot of people were vocal and shouting out things which was a riot all in itself.\n\nMy hubby Chris stated I should complain to a Manager on the way out however I was not in the mood to wait as I saw several unhappy people go up to request a Manager after the movie let out.\n\nI did later call and spoke to Supervisor Kyle who was a sweetheart and advised that he will give us a set of complimentary tickets for another time due to the bad experience.
