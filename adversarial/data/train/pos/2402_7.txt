I have been visiting this place for many years! I don't know why it took me so long to make this review? The quality and taste has not changed. \n\nI love sweets and this place know how to do it right, with family traditions that immigrated from The Netherlands how can you go wrong. My favorite is the crepe or the banana split, it comes with everything. Ice cream, fresh fruit, whipped cream, a crepe, chocolate and\/or strawberry sauce, and walnuts. The banana split is almost the same only with a banana, my favorite fruit to mix with ice cream! \n\nThen there is the staff, this is a family owned place so all the family work here. I have seen the owners kids grow up to become adults, and now work as servers here. the service is quick just remember that there is usually a line to get served. The wait is well worth it. \n\nI love visiting this place as it is my absolute favorite ice cream place! I recommend it highly.
