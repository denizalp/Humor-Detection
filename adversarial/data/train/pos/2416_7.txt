Best prices I've found at a local walk-in dispensary. Great service. Very friendly and helpful staff. I love the huge digital information and pricing board in the waiting room. They offer free water and munchies (candy, breakfast bars, crackers, etc.) when you enter. Large comfortable product display room with great lighting. Excellent selection of strains with occasional sales, too. Not the closest dispensary to me, but almost always worth the extra travel. Their Green Life products are of the highest quality. I get free Big Macs for my purchases. I'm not sure if that's a limited time special, or if that's a regular thing. Overall, this place is top-notch.
