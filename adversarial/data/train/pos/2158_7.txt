How can Melt only have 4 stars? \n\nThis veg-friendly place does get packed, but you can easily make new friends and grab one of their insane selections of beers. I opted for a delish hefe and our group of 7 settled in at the bar and wound up just eating there. The food was absolutely incredible. I built my sammy with portabella mushrooms and roasted red peppers and pesto. The sandwich is huge, and for being a stick figure, I plowed through my sandwich and 1\/2 of my friend's, It was just... that good. Any selection that isn't a sandwich is delicious as well. \n\nThe bartenders were extremely accommodating despite the rush, and we were extremely pleased with the timely service and crazy decor. It's a fun place to chill, and even better place to eat. Though going to a ghetto strip club afterward made the night even more memorable. (Note: to enjoy Melt, visiting a strip club is not necessary.)
