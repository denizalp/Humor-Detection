I had to take my son to emergency room last week. We spend 6 hours in waiting room before the doctor showed up to help us. His English was so bad that I had to ask him repeat everything two or three times... My husband is American and he was always telling me that we are lucky to have free healthcare. Well, if this is what our \"free\" healthcare means, I would much rather prefer a paid one.
