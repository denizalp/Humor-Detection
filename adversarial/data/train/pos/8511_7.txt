This place is like McDonalds deciding to be Bachi Burger but still charging the same prices. It's delectible. It's totally hole-in-the-wall, the kinda place I love and want to transport to Montana with me. \n\nFor $35 including tip and tax, I got Chicken Larb, Beef Pad See Eu, Green Chicken Curry, and Chicken Tom Ka. All were fantastic with large portions. The green curry had a potent seasoning (probably an herb that I'm not used to) and so it wasn't my favorite but it was still so excellently prepared. The Chicken Larb was crack, the best I've ever had. Tom Ka and Pad See Eu on point. \n\nAll created within 15 minutes, with fresh herbs, galangal and veg. I'm jealous of those who live so close to this place. I love Thai food.
