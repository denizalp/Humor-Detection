I've been meaning to come for a long time. I pass by it all the time to\/from work and it's either too early or too late.\n\nJin greets us and like what most Yelpers said asked for our names and asked if it's our first time.\n\nBF and I both got the \"Create Your Own\" combo with fried strips, mac and cheese and each a wasabi sauce, BFG for me, and sweet chili for him. \n\nWhile we were waiting he asks, \"are either of you Yelpers?\" I thought it was rather curious question but I said \"yes\". He then explained that it's because he noticed a pattern of ordering that first timers who get what I got tend to be Yelpers because they read what is considered the \"best\".  On the way there I was reading the reviews and he's right.....and about 10 of the reviews are people I know. Haha. So there- they know youre a Yelper if you're getting the \"best of\" box. Then he asked about us and told us a bit about himself and Tin. \n\nThe strips were juicy, crispy and not oily at all. I love they have a variety to sauces to suit your mood to dress it up but even alone it was nicely seasoned. I loved the wasabi sauce..a little bit of zing and a bit of sweet. The chili sauce is not that thai chili sauce from the bottle and was tasty with a hit of cilantro in it. BFG has a good tang. Garlic bread has slices of garlic on it. Yay! I kinda eat a lot of garlic so it makes me happy (sorry if I sit next to you while I sweat, haha). Mac and cheese is very cheesy and gooey. I hate when baked gets dry but this had a lot of cheesy goodness. If this was open late then I'd probably never go to Cane's. We only go there because it's fresh and open late. I'll steal my Yelp bestie Angela H.'s word- it's \"normalicious\". Delicious, doing simple comfort food right. \n\nAs we were sitting there enjoying our food, Jin came to check on us and refill drinks so even though its counter service, they sit wait on peoples tables. We also listened to convos and he greeted a few people coming in by their name. If he remembers everyone that's pretty impressive. \n\nWe'll find out the next time we come in.
