I scream for ice cream! \nAfter a night out, my pal and gal pals weren't quite ready to go out yet so we yelped up a dessert joint the was close by and still open that we could hit up.\nThankfully we found Melt!\n\nMelt is such a cute little place, but it does its job. They sell drinks, candy, mangonadas and serves extra delicious ice cream. The packaging is so cute too, it comes in little Chinese take out boxes and includes a fortune cookie. My sister and I each got a single scoop, Cookie Monster and a Cute-cumber. Our total came out to $9.00 even. Single scoops are $4.50, double scoops are $6.00 and triple scoops are $7.50. Cookie Monster was the perfect amount of sweet and chewy from the cookie and cookie dough. Cute-cumber was a refreshing, very light, less sweet option. We both enjoyed our ice creams very much. I really like that they have a lot of different and seasonal flavors, some like zombie brains, pumpkin pie and churro. \n\nThey do have a roomy outside area to sit and enjoy, none inside. They have tea lights and benches that create such a cozy ambiance. I like it here, and I can't wait to come back to try new\/changing\/seasonal flavors!\n\nAlso:\nParking is a little hard to find on busy nights, and meters are available.
