Stab-Mart for sure.\n\nI wouldn't come here at night, and I wouldn't drive a nice car here either.\nBums will approach you in the parking lot (reminds me a LOT of the Lancaster,CA location) \n\nI cam in here on a whim, it was over picked and full of the most interesting looking creeps ever.\n\nReturn factor: Probably not.
