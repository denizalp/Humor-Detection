Clean, clean, clean.  I don't care how dirt cheap your membership is I don't like the idea of knowing there may be stripper ass sweat still on the bed I'm about to lay on.  Good beds, never had bulbs out or anything.  Ive only seen guys at the front desk, they're always cool, and friendly, you never get the vibe that you are interrupting their facebook time.  They sell lotions and protein powers, but Ive never bought from there so i don't know about the prices.
