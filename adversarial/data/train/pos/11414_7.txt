I'm so glad I went inside and checked in on Yelp, because now I'm entitled to 1% off on a \"Screamin-O Calendar.\"  The place has a large selection of naughtiness, but even though I'm far from being a prude, it's still kind of awkward being in there.  We browsed for a while and got so aroused that we went and got ourselves some frozen yogurt.  We're kinky that way!
