We decided to try this new Thai restaurant for lunch based on a recent review.    We each ordered Thai ice tea and shared orders of basil shrimp and spicy noodles with shrimp.  Lunch entrees include a cup of some nondescript broth that neither of us finished.  The basil shrimp lacked both basil and much in the way of vegetables or meat while the spicy noodles dish was exceptionally bland and visually unappealing.
