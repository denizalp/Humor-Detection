Food was ok.  Ordered Crepe Chez Vous and it was too salty.  The chicken was processed (like the ones in subway sandwiches) and the mushrooms tasted like it was either canned or jarred.  The smoked salmon sandwich (forgot the name) was good, except the bread was tough and chewy.  I was hoping the bread was warm and toasty on the outside and softer inside.  The chocolate croissant was good.  The coffee was \"eh\", especially for it being $3.  I gave 2 stars bc it was too pricey for the quality of the food.\n\n\nUpdate to my review (after owner's response): to be clear, she is 1 1\/2 years old and we immediately moved her legs when she was fighting to get out of my husband's lap.  The plates were not \"cleared\" as you claimed.  Also, I said food \"ok\" not disgusting (as is your attitude to my opinions), so since we were paying $$ for brunch and haven't had breakfast, we ate more than half the portion.  The chicken was definitely processed and I don't understand why you would argue otherwise.  But rest assured, I will never come back to support an owner who displays such a childish reaction.   You've lost all the stars.
