When I was 7 years old I asked my dad for navy blue jogging pants.  We got on our bikes and made our way to Towers at Galleria Mall.  He found me some pants and bought them.  When we got home we realized they weren't navy blue at all but were in fact dark purple.\n\nThe Towers is long gone but the lighting hasn't changed so be careful or you may make a similar mistake.\n\nI'm intrigued by the \"restaurant\" in the middle of the mall - it seems to be consistently busy ... but the photos of the food are so discoloured that I feel the food might be equally old.  There's also a hair salon that smells like a bad perm I got in 1990 - it's always busy so they must be doing something right.\n\nThat being said it feels like the more recent changes have been very positive.  FreshCo has replaced the old Price Chopper - a nice update with fresher food and a better selection all around.   I'm still a little wary of the fresh meats though.  The new Dollarama is also a convenient addition.  The Zellers was running on economy mode for so long (they didn't even bother turning on half the lights) that it's a good thing it's gone.\n\nOther pluses:\n- LCBO\n- PetValu\n- TD Bank\n\nThe Rexall Pharma Plus is a bit of a mess... I always have trouble finding things in there.\n\nConsidering how small this mall is it's actually quite busy with people from the community.  It's really not that bad a place once you get used to the very dated decor - it's really convenient if you live in the neighbourhood and has the basics - including inexpensive t-shirts, leggings and old school arcade machines.
