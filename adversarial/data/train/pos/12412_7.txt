It's been some what 11 years ago that ... I have not been to Las Vegas and 11 years later here I am!!! I'm back in Las Vegas on a three day trip!!! The Excalibur Hotel for me is one of the most nicest hotel that I have ever stayed at!!! And also the Excalibur Hotel reminds me of Disneyland!!! The things that I like most about the Excalibur is the Interesting slot machines that they have and Wonder Woman is one of them slot machine that I played!!! And the other things that I like most about The Excalibur Hotel is the food court that they have for you to eat at and also I love the shopping areas which is near by the food court!!! If your at the Excalibur Hotel shopping around go to the Welcome To Las Vegas Souvenir Store it's my most favorite place to shop at!!! I definitely would wanna come back to this beautiful castle in the near future!!!
