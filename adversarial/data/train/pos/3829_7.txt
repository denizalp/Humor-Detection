When I think of my favorite restaurants in Las Vegas, Panevino always comes to mind. The ambiance, food and service has always been top notch. For me it's a special occasion kind of resto because you will pay a pretty penny but let me reassure you, they won't let you down. \n\nIt's a bit off the beaten path, when you start to see airplanes you know you're getting close. I wasn't expecting a view with my meal but the beautiful architecture throughout was definitely intended to draw your attention toward the amazing views of the strip. No wonder it made the Best of Las Vegas list for Restaurants With a View. \n\nAmong my favorite dishes were the cioppino and ravioli. As for the drinks, Lights Out (appropriately named) caught my attention because it was the first time I've seen everclear on any drink menu before. That brings me back. \n\nThe ambiance sets the mood for a lovely night out with your loved one. Dim lighting and modern decor gives such a welcoming and romantic feel. This resto has some of the best service I have ever experienced, IMO anyway. This is a huge part of why it stands out to me. Right down to cleaning the crumbs off your table & always making the right suggestions for your meal. They are very attentive but know when to check on you and when to give you some space, I love that. Nothing worse than trying to have a conversation with your date and being interrupted every 10 seconds when it's clear you don't need anything. Panevino just gets it. Well done!
