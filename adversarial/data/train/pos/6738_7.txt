Not only am I pissed off about the gas situation these days for what it's doing to my wallet, I'm pissed off because it's keeping me away for my new love, Dilworth Coffee in Concord. \n\nI bought a Groupon for $15 worth of goodies for his location unknowingly since I didn't look at the location since I disregard important details like that. So when I read the fine print, I thought \"Damn, a trip up to Concord? Better make a day trip out of it\" I walked in and was overtaken and suddenly in a magical land of java wonderfulness. Think of the scene in Charlie and The Chocolate Factory when they walk into his candyland and the Pure Imagination song was playing--that was me in Dilworth Coffee. Fresh coffee, pastries, drinks, chill music playing, seats aplenty (mismatched seats which made it even better), local art work for sale-the whole shebang. I was a happy gal. The barista was super friendly and helped me with my fresh coffee selection, letting me know which ones were light and dark roast. I always get the Morehead but took a gamble and went with the Cinnamon Hazelnut this time. Since I was being saucy, I decided to get something I haven't had in awhile an iced chai latte. And dare I say it was the best I've ever had? I sat there, happily sitting while enjoying their wifi and just felt like all was right in the world. \n\nI don't care if it puts a dent in my gas tank, I may have to drive up to Concord in the near future and get happy again. The lengths I go to for a real coffeehouse experience......
