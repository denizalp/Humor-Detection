I'm giving it 4 stars. This is because I'm trying to judge this place objectively. \n\nIt is nice. It is very small. It is decent. It looks like the type of place someone from a rom-com would go to on a first date. It is lovely in a lot of ways. I always hear people talk highly of it.\n\nI'm not super into the singer\/song writer thing. Maybe if I were more into that then I would appreciate it more.\n\nIt just is so....stuffy to me. I feel guilty for laughing in there. I have a loud cackle that I cannot control when someone makes an especially good joke. I have to really try not to laugh when inside The Evening Muse (WHICH MAKES ME WANT TO REALLY LAUGH)\n\nI think this is probably a really great place for a lot of people. I just don't get it. It is me- not them. I have heard that they are involved in the community and that is great.\n\nSo, yay, take a date here. Just be prepared to sit and not dance.
