This Walmart or like my friends and I refer to as scaremart is just that. There are always homeless people lurking around and begging for money. I've been approached several times. The inside of the store isn't any better. It is rarely well stocked and not very clean. I only go here because of prices and convenience. I avoid going here at night and alone because of crime.
