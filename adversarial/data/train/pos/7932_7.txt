Newfangled. Mouth-watering. Costly. Chic. \n\nI've driven by Hi Tide daily on my commute to work. When it opened I doubted it would last. After having a bowl tonight, I can only hope it does. \n\nI chose to build my own bowl since I have dietary restrictions. As i was going through the list i was surprised by the options and how much I could pack into this vibrant bowl of fresh healthy foods. \n\nI opted for the large, a $5 up charge, and I'm so glad i did. It was filling, but not too much (especially scone I had mostly fruit and veggies). The crispy tofu was better than most and didn't seem greasy. \n\nI can't wait to take my husband here for the lobstah (New England way of saying it) roll. He will be wicked happy!\n\nI don't think you could go wrong with the menu options or something you create yourself. \n\nNext up for me, those nachos!!
