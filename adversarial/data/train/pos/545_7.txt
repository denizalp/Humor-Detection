For a man that Yelps and relies on other Yelper's thoughts, it slipped my mind to check reviews, and just jumped right in.  Had I read my buddy Mike S.'s (Yelp! should implement a way to link people within reviews!  I digress...) review before, I'm certain I would not have ordered from here.  That's what happens when its gets past dinnertime and you forgot to eat because you're working feverishly to meet deadlines.\n\nA bit overpriced, but plenty of food provided.  That said, it's just food, nothing special:\n\nTangerine Chicken - I guess it's dissimilar from orange chicken bc it's miniature.  No, I'm not talking about tangerines, I'm talking about the chicken.  It was literal scraps of chicken that was breaded (somehow), fried and glazed.  Too much sauce, not enough chicken.  I guess tangerines also have a subtler taste than oranges, perhaps?\n\nHot and (Not) Sour Soup:  I've had hot and sour soup at a number of places, and this was one of a handful of places that don't use enough corn starch to get the desired viscosity.  May be a preference thing... one thing that is not a preference is that it should be a bit sour using vinegar.  Didn't really taste that part of it.  Enjoyed the fresh vegetables in it, but that was offset some by how much oil floated to the top.\n\nFried Rice - Just white rice and soysauce cooked for a bit on a pan.\n\nJumbo Shrimp with Garlic Sauce:  The dish is the saving grace that kept the rating above one star.  I thought it tasted quite good.  Again, the vegetables were money--they looked and tasted fresh.  Shrimp were the average shrimp size, not the small ones--I guess, hence JUMBO.  Good texture as the shrimp didn't have that taste like it's been frozen forever.\n\nI won't be ordering from here again.  Prices need to drop to match quality or quality needs to improve to match price.  In any event, no more random ordering without checking Yelp!\n\ndmo out.
