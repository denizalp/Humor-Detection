Sonic Boom has a lot of potential, nice looking spacious music wonder world, if it would only offer you more for your decent used CD's.\nThey will offer you around .25 cents to $1.75 for your used CD's\nCustomer service is non-existent here, no eye contact, lots of attitude from sloppy dressed\/groomed employees who should consider a shave, maybe wear some nicer clothing and be more enthusiastic.
