Sorry Nick. But no part of my review was false. I have the entire conversation between you and I recorded, and my S.O. has his recorded as well. You never offered to fix the issue free of charge; you repeatedly told me you would \"go after people who leave negative reviews\". If anyone wants to hear what this guy is really like, send me a message at vrockfor@asu.edu and I'll be happy to send you both recorded calls where he states he's going to go after me for leaving a bad review. He also states that since his shop was unable to duplicate my stalling issue, he can't help us. He stated further that me asking for a refund was \"abusive\" and he then hung up on me. Keep it classy Nick! You've been reported to the BBB and, as I have a lawyer through my employment, you will be responding to all of the evidence we have in court. Yelpers, if you haven't gathered yet: DO NOT GO HERE!
