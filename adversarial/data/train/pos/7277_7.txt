I used to love going to Panera Bread in the Midwest. But something has changed over the intervening years since I've moved out West. They have changed up the menu, I get that, always trying to improve. The problem is that I haven't found my go to sandwich. After three tries you're out Panera. I had the Chicken Frontega and it was so so at best. I left a little hungry after spending over 11 dollars for a grilled sandwich and a soda.
