I cant believe I haven't reviewed Secret Pizza yet. It's only my favorite pizza shop in Vegas!\nWhy is it my fave? The balance of cheese, sauce, and crust is perfect. Their dough seems different than what the competitors use and the cheese has a familiar NY flavor. It may be nostalgia, but I am convinced Secret Pizza has a Secret! It may be that the ingredients are imported, or a secret ingredient is used (salt?)... what ever it is, I love it!\nThe shop is located in Cosmopolitan, you can pass by it a dozen of times and not even know it's there. The blatant \"secret\" of the shop is the location. You will see an inconspicuous entrance, without a door, next to Blue Ribbon, you will walk down the hallway and voila! That's where the great pizza hides. \nThe space isn't big, you basically order and go. Though there are a couple of stools, in case you wanted to grub and move on. Most people come in for a slice and eat it elsewhere in the hotel. \nThe times I've eaten here, both sober and clever ;), I've always enjoyed it. \nFun fact, they also have draft beer. \nEnjoy!
