Oh Chanpen, I didn't think I could like you anymore than I already did until I came to your new location! I met a couple friends here and omg this location is nice! The old location was fine, especially because it held the delish food inside, but this nondescript location in a strip mall was super clean looking and nicely decorated. The food was just as good as at the original location, with their main triumph (in my opinion) being that they actually make their food spicy when you ask them to. Seems like not a big deal, but, in Phoenix, they're the only ones who do this. I got the drunken noodles and thai tea.... both delicious, both huge - I had a ton of leftovers. We all got treated to complimentary green tea ice cream at the end of the meal.... this stuff was out of this world good. I will be back!!
