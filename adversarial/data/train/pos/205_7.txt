All I really remember about this buffet was standing in line. \n\nStanding in line for seating. We spent the extra $15 for the express line. Was it worth it? Yes...during peak times. It probably saved us an hour. \n\nStanding in line for the food. The way that the buffet is built requires everyone to stand in lines to get to any of the popular food stations. It was a nightmare, but probably also a strategy by the designers to get every one filled up on the cheap food. Because guess what is at the end of the line? The most expensive food...crab legs, clams, oysters and shrimp. By the time we actually got back to our seats with the food, most of it was cold. Eek. But the best way to get through the lines is to pair up and have one person hold a place in the line while the other person puts the plates full of food on the table. Repeat. \n\nThe food: Prime rib and lamb chops were dry, clam chowder was super salty, sweet potato tater tots were delish, kobe sliders were ok, crab legs were ok, shrimp was huge and fresh and everything else wasn't too memorable. \n\nBut...since I paid $65 for this buffet, I was going to get the most bang for my buck. The oysters! My friends and I originally grabbed a bunch of oysters in the shell, but then realized we would get the most out of the oysters shots, which are at the very end of the buffet line. We didn't even have to wait in line, we just kept grabbing the oysters shots from the counter. We poured the extra tomato juice out and just kept eating. Needless to say...a delicious overdose of raw oysters. =P\n\nFor dessert I really liked the macarons, the creme brulee, the watermelon mint sorbet (so refreshingly clean), and the fig gelato were delish. Also, they serve FRESH squeezed orange juice and watermelon juice here. Just ask the waiter. Loved. \n\nOverall, there are some high points, but I consider this place average when there are competing buffets in the vicinity with less lines, lower prices, and more unique dishes.
