My hubby selected Feeney's for my bday dinner because I have been dying to try a Beef Wellington after watching Hell's Kitchen for years.  Pastry and beef, hello!!!  \n\nThis place is one of those old school restaurants, tables, and feel.  I remember these places when I was a kid.  We were greeted right away and she turned out to be our server too.  Maria was awesome and her support staff.  Our drinks were never empty and they came to check on us multiple times but not to the point that they are standing over us.  \n\nWe ordered:\nChicken Wings with Ranch - Those little things are spicy but so crispy.  The ranch helped to cut some of the spicy.\n\nCream of Broccoli Soup - Thick, creamy, and good.\n\nBeef Wellington - OMG, it was good.  It was so good, I could not stop eating.  The mash potato and gravy was a great side to go with my wellington.  \n\nLamp Chops - My hubby loved it!  He said we are coming back!!!\n\nThey bread that came with the meal was so good!!!  I ate both pieces of the rye.  My husband had the pumpernickel.\n\nThe server found out we were there to celebrate my bday, so she bought me a huge slice of mud pie (ice cream).  It was so good and they sang happy birthday to me.  Too bad, I was only available to have a few bites.  I was so full from the wellington, but happy bday to my hubby, he inhaled MY mud pie.  =)
