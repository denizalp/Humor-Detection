in vegas, the growing world of all you can eat sushi restaurants mimics the rapid growth of vegas.  i yet have to find my favorite place.  i frequent this place a lot b\/c of the proximity to the people i usually eat there with. \ni was disappointed my first time. they did not have an alcohol license at the time.  (I want to drink Sake and SAKE BOMBS, argghhh!!!!)  the service was awful.  the waiter kept reminding our group that all-u-can eat sushi had a time limit and that we had to finish all our orders, including the rice.  i was truly offended at the comments.  i came from Reno, where i still believe the concept of all-u-can eat sushi at the sushi bar began (this was about 16yrs ago...props to Sushi Teri).  We were also very hungry, it was not necessary to remind us.  i mean it's even written in the menu.  at that point my friend and i was pissed.  the two of us to start a mission to target one item on menu and make them run out of it.  we  targeted the mussels.  we kept ordering 4 orders of them (about 5 times).  it came to the point where our waiter kept avoiding our table and avoiding making eye contact with my friend and i.  i finally got him to return to the the table, so i can ask for some more.  he was apologetic to tell us that he can only give us 1 more order because they had no more left. ha..ha...ha  our mission was complete along with eating several orders of sushi, some tempura, some edamame, yellow tail collar, and some ice cream and mochi.  \nthe all-u-can-eat  menu is quite extensive.  they have several types of appetizers, nigiri, hand rolls, long rolls, and dessert items.  i haven't tried that many rolls b\/c i just love nigiri and the rolls fill you up too fast .    im disappointed that they limit you to only 2 orders of ama-ebi and toro. i think their ama-ebi was crap anyway.  i don't think it's really sweet shrimp.  yeah, this is one of the better all-u-can eat sushi place in vegas, but i doubt it is the best.  so the search goes on....
