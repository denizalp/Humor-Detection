While not as huge as, say, the Children's Museum in Boston or Pittsburgh, this is still a pretty cool place to let the kiddos run around and go crazy for a couple hours. Not having any children myself (that I know of, at least), I went here with some out-of-town friends and their two-year-old. She had tons of fun, and such activities as the hay maze outside and the water exhibit inside were also surprisingly entertaining for adults that had two beers at lunch.
