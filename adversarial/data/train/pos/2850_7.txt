Excellent food, almost picked up my plate to lick it clean.\n\nWhy then only 3 stars?\n\n1. service was good, but not spectacular.  For the price and the billing, I expected better.  First class prices deserve first class service, and this wasn't it.  \n\n2. Wine sommelier had serious attitude.  I asked a couple of basic questions when trying to choose a wine that went with the variety of dishes on the table and he actually huffed a little when I didn't get 2 of the $120 bottles he recommended and ordered the $60 wine instead.  pissed me off.\n\n3. People dressing like they are in F'ing Disneyland.  Come on people, when dining at a $45 a plate restaurant run by a world famous chef, at least dress for dinner.  Shorts and t-shirts are so not appropriate. \n\nOK, the last one really isn't the restaurants fault.  It's just an issue I have with Vegas in general.  But I'm not ready to upgrade them to 4 stars yet.\n\nJust my 2 cents worth.
