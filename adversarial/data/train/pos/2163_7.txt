I had a haircut this morning at Epic but I am thinking of moving on.  This is the third time that I have had a haircut here (with the same girl, whom I will not name). While she has done an ok job, each time I go it gets more and more uncomfortable. You know how you build up a friendship of of sorts with your stylist? Well this girl does not speak or smile until you leave. And it seems like I was being rushed. My appointment today was for 9:15 and I was out of there by 9:45. 30 minutes. I go to a salon to feel pampered and relaxed not rushed and given the silent treatment each time. It may just be the girls personality, sadly, because she does a good job. When there, I notice all the other stylist are smiling and talking to their clients. Also I am never asked how my experience was or if I would like to make a follow-up. So after 3 times I am done.
