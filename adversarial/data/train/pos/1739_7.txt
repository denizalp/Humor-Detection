Rude staff. Shitty sound. Won't ever be coming back here regardless of who is playing. I dont understand how any staff member could think it is ok to trash an artist when they are preforming. It doesn't matter if the person doesn't like the artist, but at least respect them enough to let them preform. That stupid bitch bartender deserves to be fired.
