Managememt apparently has no problem with homeless people being in their restaurant harassing customers.\n\nI've had homeless people hit me up for money and food before at a restaurant entry, but I've  never had one follow me inside to the register and continue to harass me as I'm ordering. Until today...\n\nWhen my sandwich arrived another homeless person rolled his wheelchair next to my table to ask me if I was going to eat the other half of my sandwich.  \n\nI get that it isn't the most affluent part of town, but management needs to set some boundaries or people like me will not come back no matter how good their pastrami is.
