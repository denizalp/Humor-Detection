May I just ask, what is your disaster preparedness plan?  You have none.  Why is it my husband and son went to the movie, and the tornado sirens are blaring in Chagrin Falls, and you have such little regard for that, that you keep the movie playing, until atlass the power is off!!! Then my husband finally sees the texts that I have been sending him and calls me to find out how close the tornado is.  That's your job, to keep your patrons safe, or atleast I thought it was!
