I  strongly dislike waiting any longer than 4 minutes to be greeted by whoever our server may be. Even more so when the number of visible working employees greatly outnumbers the patrons at 345 PM on a very slow Thursday. \n\nWe came expecting the happy hour of half-off burgers, $1 fries, and good deals on drinks from long ago....but was sorely disappointed to discover that it no longer is offered. While the $1 fries are still offered, paying $10 for 6 sliders seemed a bit ridiculous...among other things. \n\nThe more time that slowly crept by after being seated, as well as my disappointing discovery of a newer\/shittier happy hour, and the looming dread of paying ALOT more than I was anticipating with a party of 3, we were just about to walk out. \n\nOh wait, there's our server, fine, I guess we will stay and hope it's at least worth it. Server seemed nice I guess, table ordered 2 build your owns, 3 fries, a porky burger and PBR for me - of which I received BOTH the can and an empty glass. I'm fine with just a can, server could have asked a preference at least. \n\nThe wait time was fine in terms of receiving our order. But not short enough to distract me from noticing a number of fruit flies buzzing around our table and in our faces. One of them actually found its way down into my dumb glass of PBR, needless to say I was done drinking after finding it. What the fuck?!\n\nBurgers were cooked decently. Mine came without the BBQ sauce it was supposed to come with - so the tableside coffee BBQ had to do. Fries were great, but all of our burgers just made the bottom bun a soggy, unappealing mess. \n\nShould have just walked out and gone somewhere else. $50 really didn't sit well with me with this experience. Would only consider coming back for a better, price-appealing happy hour that includes actual burgers instead of shitty sliders. But I doubt that will be happening.
