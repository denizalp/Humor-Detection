This is one of the newest DQ's around.  They are also one of the most busiest yet most efficient locations.  Every time we go here, no matter what time of day or night, there is a ridiculous line in the drive through, you would swear it was In-N-Out at lunchtime.  Luckily the staff is able to move very quickly through all those customers.  On every visit there I have found the cashiers to be quite friendly.  The majority of the people who work here are high school kids, but they all seem to have a pretty good time.  Their blizzards are some of the better ones here, and they tend to get them mixed pretty well all the way to the bottom.  Sometimes you get a little cheated on the mix-ins and sometimes they are generous, but it's usually pretty consistent.  If you can, see if Jeff can make your blizzard, they're the best.  That was a shameless plug for my little bro, but he really does make a killer blizzard.
