After a very filling breakfast I decided to \"work it off\" by hiking up here for some coffee and treats. Their pastries comes from 350 bakery in the Southside. I learned that 350 bakery is a catering establishment. Others come from one of my favorites Mediterra bakery.\n\nI got to sample the coffee of the day which had a bit of a fruity taste so I went with it and ordered a cranberry orange scone from 350 bakery. Both were very good. I already know the quality of Mediterra and believe me they also make great pastries and breads you can find most anywhere or in their home base in Robinson Twp. The salesman told me he could make a pour over if I didn't like it or settle for a regular blend. I thought that was very thoughtful of him and was glad with the my guatemala coffee with the fruity notes. They too sell it but at a hefty pricetag. Yes, there is a gender neutral restroom here.\n\nThis place offers free WiFi since many students come here with their laptops. This is another very good coffeeshop I want to revisit on my future trips to this area. I am anxious to try out some of the other baked goods from 350 bakery since they are a catering establishment.
