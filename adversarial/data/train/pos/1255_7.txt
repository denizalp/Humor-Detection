This location isn't too bad of a location and the inside is not dirty but it's not necessarily clean. They have food and left overs on some of the tables and chairs. Also the table with the spices is messy. \n\nThe girl who takes the orders, who was a red head, is very rude... I asked for a receipt and told me she couldn't it. Asked why and she shrugged. I'm guessing it's because she over charged me... Never had a frap be more than 7 dollars that's a grande?...
