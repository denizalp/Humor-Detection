Called the night before when I realized that my boyfriends and my flights were gonna be like a day apart and I had no ride to his house. This rate beat everyone elses. I called when I landed to make sure they were there. They gave prompt service and pick up with in ten minutes of me getting curbside. I went all the way to Concord and the rate was $40. He was surprised when I tipped him. I will admit his GPS was a bit off and he didn't set it to the morning commute to allow traffic changes and lane closures. But he was apologetic. I was so happy to get home within half and hour..shower and be in my bed without a flaw. Highly recommend!
