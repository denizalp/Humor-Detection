You know what reallllllllly chaps my ass? When a table that gets seated after I've been seated and ordered gets their food before me. Even worse when TWO tables that were seated after me get their food before me. Even worse when we ask the manager about our food and she says the ticket times are running 20 minutes and our ticket was only put in 15 minutes ago when we had been seated for 45 minutes already. Even worse when my friend asks for another beer while we wait since our waiter had not come over once to check on us and the manager rolls her eyes at him.  Even worse when our food finally arrives 55 minutes after we've been seated and they have given me the wrong sandwich and there is skin on top of my husband's grits from sitting so long.\n\nIt was really hard for me to not flip the table over at that point. I kept the wrong sandwich because I'd already waited close to an hour and was starving.  I will say that my wrong sandwich ended up being very tasty and they took it off the bill, but the experience with customer service was quite disastrous and I won't be visiting this establishment again.
