Automatic +3 stars just for having gotten rid of the mechanical bull. \n\nI came here with a pal to check out the new digs and it had a fresh new take on the corner locale upstairs from Yardhouse that has otherwise seemed haunted by its predecessors. It looks like somebody in Town Square management finally realized that putting in a country-slash-hip-hop-slash-EDM bar was just poor business sense and a waste of real estate! \n\n[Enter McFadden's] The whole place is wide and open, with a bar each as soon as you enter, as you walk through the joint, and again on the outside patio in the back. It's like a game to see if you can make it to the end of the venue without being tempted by a shot of whiskey or a pint of beer. Hint: everyone loses. \n\nI can't comment on the food as I had none, but McFadden's is spacious with tables\/chairs and booths abound, whilst boasting itself as the \"Home of the $5 Burger.\" With happy hour from 4p-7p and reverse happy hour Sunday-Tuesday from 9p-close, I can see myself stopping by for a sip and a bite because of its convenient location. \n\nCheers to a new bar, may it actually stick around this time!
