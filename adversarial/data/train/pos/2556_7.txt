Pretty sweet show. We sat in the splash zone because the tickets were cheaper, and I still don't understand why people hate those seats. I thought they were awesome and got to be within inches of everything that was going on. Just because your close doesn't mean you're going to get soaked. All you catch is a little mist. It was seriously a great show filled with lots of color, beauty, brawn, and crazy theatrics. Great show!
