started out seeming cool, especially for halloween. after the elevator ride and walk down the hall to my dirty room it is obvious that they keep it dark I the lobby to hide the dust and filth!! \n\nwe got a room here because it is cheap (In more ways than one!!) and right off the freeway as we have to be up at 4 am for a long drive and need good rest.\n\nthe music is SO LOUD that even with earplugs I can't sleep!! I've been laying here for hours, the room is trashy and dirty, the art in this room is totally creepy and they say they don't have the technology to charge my credit card for a drink service...\n\nwhen I called to complain about the noise the guy said that I has been told it was loud which is a LIE, a female was working when we checked in and she most certainly did NOT say anything about this noise!! \n\nthey made such a huge deal about \"damage to the room\", I thought the rooms must be really nice... I WAS WRONG!! there is already a ton of damage in this room, none of which was caused by us!! \n\nthis hotel is a dump and the employees are liars!! not at all helpful or the least bit accommodating!! this place is not well built, sounds as if im out there at the club it's so loud!!\n\nat this point there are people yelling in the hallway. I'm starting to worry about the safety of my vehicle parked in the valet...and for my own personal safety as well!!\n\nI think they made the hotel as a place for people that hook up at the club to shack up at. it's HORRIBLE, it's DIRTY, and the employees are RUDE.\n\nI HATE THIS PLACE.
