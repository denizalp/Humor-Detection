Southwest needs to figure it out. 9 flights coming into 2 baggage claims. This is after a a 40min delay leaving and sitting on the runway in LasVegas for another 30min eating for a gate as there is 4 empty right out the window. I think for the extra couple dollars they will no longer get my money this is absolutely terrible.\n\nSouthwest is 0-2 coming and going. We have been sitting on the plane for a while now as they had to remove a sick passenger. Now it is not there fault the person got sick but it should have been pretty simple to remove them from the plane and keep it pushing. They don't really seem to care to much about the 200+ people that are on the plane and we are sitting waiting for the paramedics to check the passenger out.
