Searching for a burrito (my first burrito in months!) in this snowy northeastern French-Canadian city, I walked furiously towards my target, Burritoville, only to find that it was closed. (What's up with that, restful Canadians? Why do you have so much more vacation time than your southern neighbor? Why are Americans so overworked and unhappy? But I digress...)\n\nHungry and growing ravenous, I turned the corner onto Maisonneuve, dejected but still going at a restless pace.\n\nI walk by countless restaurants but none of them appeal.\n\nSuddenly, I pass one called Amir. Huh, I think to myself. I see a photographic rendition of not one but two vegetarian options. I'm intrigued.\n\nI'm about to keep on walking to search for a Commensal (where I've eaten almost every single time when I'm searching for food downtown) because I'm confused as to the entrance. I see the window, I don't know if they're even open, but-- a-ha! A glass door lurks from a few steps down.\n\nI enter and I'm greeted warmly with a \"hello\" and English. I ask about the vegetarian options and choose to get the house plate. As one worker helps prepare my plate, another rings me up and asks-- \"Do you need a fork?\"\n\nI say no, I have one. She looks at my tray and sees there's no fork. \"But I don't see one...\"\n\n\"I bring my own.\"\n\n\"Everywhere? Why?\"\n\n\"To save plastic.\"\n\nShe looked at me and said, \"Wow! You're the best!\" She turns to her coworker: \"Did you hear that?\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" he replies, \"there was one guy who brought in his own plate, too, once.\"\n\nThe plates are plastic. If I come back, I'll bring my own as well. She rings me up-- 8.88$, three lucky numbers in Chinese culture-- and I sit down with a smile.\n\nI begin my plate and it's delicious. I try to eat slowly, but I'm also hungry and it's delicious. Falafel, hummus, salad, eggplant, cauliflower, and roast potatoes in a way I'd never experienced before.\n\nDelicious.\n\nWonderful service and wonderful food. (Apparently it's Lebanese, so that's the first time I've tried it!)\n\nRecommended.
