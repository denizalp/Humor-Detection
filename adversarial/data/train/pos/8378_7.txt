Good Store but a bit hard to find certain items.\n\nLowe's is HQ's locally in Morresville which would seem to be a big plus and it is.\n\nProblem is this is also the area where they try out new store footprints so very few stores have the same layout of merchandise since the are resident Guinea Pigs.\n\nBeen in this store a couple of time now but Huntersville and Mooresville would probably be my home stores\n\nSimple item - Furnace Filters and each stone has them them in a different location. Tow of these ae mirror images bu this one has the filters against the back wall.\n\nStill each store is constantly evolving.and while they locatons may change within individual stores, they still have great selection and good prices
