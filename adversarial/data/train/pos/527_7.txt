I'm confused by other folks' reviews of this place. It seems like people either think 1) they are the only people in the world and have grandiose ideas they're special or 2) that they are walking into a Joel Robuchon restaurant for dessert and expect to have 3 people serving them.\n\nIt is a small frozen treat shop next to a Smith's in a suburban strip mall. Where I come from, these places are traditionally staffed by teenagers and they're just places to run in and grab a treat and go home. Why are people trying to make it a dining experience?! Also, if you see a long line somewhere and are that pressed for time, WHY would you get in the line and then fire off a nasty gram on Yelp about it?!\n\nHere's my take on it: The Dole Whip is spot on. It was 101 degrees outside and it was still the proper frozen consistency and the flavors were great. The place was clean, even the restroom, and the girl working on Thursday afternoon was very nice and efficient. There are signs advising that crepes are made from scratch and take some time. (Another red flag for you uber-important people who simply can't wait in a line.) I'm glad it's moved close by and will definitely be back!
