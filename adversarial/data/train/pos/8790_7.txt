Crummy music, VERY Crowded dance floor, if there was a fire we all would have been dead. Bouncers are really rude, no seating, no free waters or sodas for the DD. It was really gross, the nicest part was the ladies rest room.  \n\nAlso the glass cups broken all over the dance floor and the fire hazard really freaked me out, I couldn't get out of there fast enough! \n\nI'll never go back to Haze, ever.
