I knew it. I knew Alma was a great place. I knew they had delicious food just by the glorious smell wafting through the air down the street. I knew all this because it was true!\n\nAlthough my last experience at was so so, this experience will make me forget that. From the first sip of my kickin' jalapeno gimlet to the last bite of the tres leche cake, that made me say \"holy crap\" out loud, it was a winner. Seriously, I have never in my life had such a scrumptious tasting dessert. It was just... HOLY CRAP!\n\nBut, the main course was just as memorable. I ordered the Camarones al caribe con ajo. Which was quite embarrassing to pronounce in front of my fellow Spanish speaking dinning companions. Yikes! I just wanted to say \"shrimp dish please.\" \n\nSpeaking of shrimp, the shrimp were fresh, plump and perfectly marinated. You knew it was legit and not frozen out of a bag (that's thee worst!). The thing that tied it all together was the plate licking lime and garlic sauce. I was scraping my plate to make sure I included all that sauce into my veggie and rice. Speaking of veggies, I loved the grilled peppers and crisp sugar snap peas. Just an entirely winning combination. \n\nI would honestly come back for each individual item. Whether it be a cocktail in their cute little side bar, aka \"Cantina,\" or devouring a tres leche dessert. You've won me over Alma and I most certainly will be back!
