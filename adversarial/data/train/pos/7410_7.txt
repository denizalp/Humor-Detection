This place is super cool. Just about anything you need to be beautified or to smell like a celebrity this is the place to go. I can spend hours in this store just looking and testing all of the great products they have to offer. I just recently had to come here more often because Walgreens and CVS stopped selling the foundation that I like. They have a generous amount of staff to assist you and are always warm and welcoming. Come here if you can't find what you need at other beauty stores, they will definitely have it. Great job Ulta!
