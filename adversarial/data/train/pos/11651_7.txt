::::: [ THE CASINO ] :::::\n\nAfter more than 12 trips to Vegas in 3 years, I still had never stepped inside of Hooters. \n\nI can't remember how it happened. All I know is there were three of us left at the latter end of a corporate retreat that kept us in Vegas 2 days longer than we initially planned. We were feeling all kinds of adventurous (I mean, intoxicated), and some random person told us the roulette machines at the Hooters had better payouts.\n\nSo we went.\n\nThe short version: NO.\n\nOutdated (vintage?) roulette table with similar payouts to the rest of Las Vegas (even on a weekday), except without the screen that displays where the ball's been landing so unless you 1.) have got excellent memory that doesn't get easily impaired or 2.) don't rely on probability or statistical propensity at all.. it's no fun.\n\nAlso, the standard machines are super old and aren't touch-screen. Most of those machines should be in a museum.\n\nThey don't even try to get you inebriated enough to think you might be enjoying yourself.\n\nAnd if you're there for the hooters.. there isn't much of that, either.\n\nNo fun.
