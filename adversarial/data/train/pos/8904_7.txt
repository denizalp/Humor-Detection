Prime Rib, check! Crab Legs, check! Unlimited beer or wine?! Whaaaaaaaaaaaaaat??? That wasn't on my list but good lord, yes, please!!! I am not much of a Buffet person but there are only 2 buffets that I'd even consider going to and Studio B is one of them! \n\nIn any buffet, it's usually expected that the quality of the food will not have the same attention as a regular sit down joint because, let's face it, buffet food is cooked in bulk and sometimes quality is lost. I did not experience that with Studio B. Crab Legs were not over cooked, oysters nice and plump, wide variety of pastas and dessert, you can choose from Gelato and various other oven baked goodies! All of the things that I always look for :) BTW, some sugar-free desserts available!\n\nIt's a very large Buffet, high ceilings, modernized decor and there's also a seating area that has a view of the Strip. We haven't had any issues with service, plates are cleared and drinks are refilled, usually upon request but I don't knock them for that because most times that we eat there, it's during the peak hours so they're usually running around like chickens with their heads cut off. \n\nNOTE: There is a LONG wait, you can wait in line 1-2 hours sometimes. Prepare yourself for that unless you arrive right when they open. When you're standing in line, there's a TV monitor that shows the prices and menu.
