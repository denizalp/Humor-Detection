A great pet store tucked away between Corso Italia and the rest of St. Clair West. \n\nFirst, go here on a Saturday if possible. Lou (sp?) is the owner and works here that day. He's from the pharmaceutical business and does R&D. For his business, he handpicks what brands to sell and even makes visits to some of the companies' factories he deals with. \n\nLou was able to provide me with quality advice on all sorts of questions and stays away from using buzz-words you'd find in the animal food world.\n\nThe store itself is small, but cozy. A large selection of brands and food\/toys\/etc. for Cats, Dogs, Reptiles, Birds, Hamsters and more. If you're looking for good prices and advice on some of the holistic\/specialty brands, I highly recommend this.\n\nBoubah's also does grooming and adoption services at reasonable rates.\n\nFinally, you may find a cat sitting on the cash counter sniffing what you just bought, but that's just part of the experience :-)\n\nOverall, a wonderful pet store and I plan to keep coming back.
