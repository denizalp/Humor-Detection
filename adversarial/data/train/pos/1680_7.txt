Fried mozzarella round- I didn't like the breading but just the cheese on the perfectly toasted pita chips was very good. It was served atop sauteed spinach with a tasty sauce on it that I didn't identify but ate up.\n\nCaesar salad- it was good. Not fantastic. More heavily dressed than I like but it wasn't fishy so it was ok.\n\nThree cheese fried chicken- the chicken was fried to perfection and not at all greasy.  I didn't really notice the cheese flavor in the breading but it was just excellent and topped with a pepper jack cheese sauce that was delicious.  Served with a veggie choice and mashed potatoes.  Eh. The chicken was the star.\n\nBlackened salmon- it was good. He liked mine better.\n\nBeernaners- all kinds of yes. Like banana stuffed funnel cake. With amazing creme anglaise for dipping that I wanted to drink.\n\nService was good and they had a good selection of cream sodas,  wine, and beer as well as a full bar.
