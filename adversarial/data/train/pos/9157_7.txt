We joined this gym soon after moving to Phoenix during the height of summer.  The pool was great and we used it quite often.  We have a small child and this pool was great for her.  There were just enough smaller children for her to play with but not too many that it was crowded.  The child care was OK.  Our daughter loved to play there, but  I did not like that the TV was constantly on and playing a movie.  I hated that TV since my daughter would gaze at it rather than play.  It also seemed that the bathrooms in child care were dirty if we went after 10AM.  Gross!\n\nI really liked the cycling classes.  The instructor on Tuesdays and Thursdays at 9:30 was phenomenal!   She got me hooked on cycling.  \n\nThe reason for the 2-star rating is the outrageous price!  I was really bothered by walking in and seeing many paid staff members dressed up in suits sitting in their offices.  What could they be doing?  I always saw them talking to each other with their doors closed.  We ultimately found another gym because I felt like I was paying quite a high price to have an overabundant staff doing who knows what.  This place was way too expensive.\n\nWe have since found a different gym with a reasonable price with staff who are appropriately dressed.  More money does not mean a better workout.
