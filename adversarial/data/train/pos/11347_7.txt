America's is a consistently good place to grab a burro or tacos. Today I called in a take out order. The woman who took my order asked if I was aware that the Melrose Street Fair was taking place, and I totally forgot. The great employee gave me directions to avoid the traffic and road closures. Even better, she told me to call when I got there, and they would run out to my car with my order. What great service! Where else does this happen?\n\nFood wise, the food is good, and chips and salsa are nice. I think the salsa could use  a little work, and could be hotter, with some more zip. Along the same lines, the guacamole seems to be getting a little watered down, and the consistency is more liquidy, almost like they were getting low on avocados, so they diluted it? Not a deal breaker, just different from usual\n\nI totally recommend this spot, and if they can just tweak the salsa so the hot salsa is HOT, and not designed for the Sun City crowd.
