I never find myself dinning in this neck of the woods but I wanted to meet a girlfriend for lunch and she works at the juvenile court nearby.  Our options looked bleak until I hopped onto my Yelp app and found this gem.  \n\nI was taken back by how clean and shiny everything was.  The display of pan dulce, agua frescas and ice creams made my mouth water when I walked inside.  \nTortas Paquime is great for a quick bite.  I had the paquitostitos and my friend had taquitos - yummy snacks on the menu.  \n\nService was fast and friendly.
