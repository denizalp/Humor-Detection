This place has crazy good reviews, so maybe I was biased walking in, but I was not impressed. It seems like a popular student spot (no doubt for the price, speed, and probably the non-intimidation factor\/general hype). Service is fast, and it's not a place you sit and talk\/prolong a meal. \n\nAs someone who grew up with this food, I will say that it wasn't bad, albeit WAY TOO SALTY (so if salt is not your jam, and you don't really eat rice, this is not the place for you). The hot stone pots that they bring are a nice touch that is becoming more and more popular, but still awesome. If you aren't super pressed for time, Koreatown up north in Markham is really the best Korean food and you can visit so many amazing Soon Tofu houses! \n\nService is really where they take the hit. Now, I am not a crazy person, and I know that sketchy service is not uncommon for many of the cheaper Asian eateries in the city (or anywhere for that matter), but this was a whole new level of bad. The guy taking our order forgot\/got confused\/had an aneurysm and didn't take food orders from two of the people at our table (and everyone else had ordered a soup, so it wasn't as if they could be sharing). Most notable though, they spilled hot soup, not once, not twice, but five times on one of our group members. This was done the first time because they tried to carry too many flaming hot bowls of soup, and kept happening as they brought over more food (I get that fast service is part of the appeal, but this was such poor judgement), and then when they tried to stack a million bowls into each other whey they were cleaning up (which ended up spilling onto one of our group members). One mistake is human, but this was just SOOOOOOOOOOOO BAAAAAAAAAAAAADDDDDDDDD! \n\nCheap or not, I don't think I will be coming back
