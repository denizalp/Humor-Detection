The menu and quality of food is pretty much exactly the same as the location on Winston Churchill. But there are some items that the Winston Churchill location doesn't have (tom yum soup, custard bun and spinach shrimp dumpling  just to name a few). \n\nFor those that know about Eddie's wok'n'roll, this KB sushi is in the same plaza just a few doors down. \n\nThis location is slightly bigger but decor is pretty plain (not that it matters so much to me but it's not as nice). And in my opinion, the service here is much better! Food came quickly and someone was always walking around to refill tea and water. They smile more and actually respond to your requests and comments. So when you say \"thank you\" they'll smile and even say \"you're welcome\" back...shocking!! \n\nI'll be back for sure! Will probably bounce back and forth at both locations
