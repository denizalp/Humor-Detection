I joined my aunt and uncle for dinner at Veneto Trattoria on this past Sunday night, and it was fabulous!  Luckily, we had a reservation because the place was packed... I'd only been there one other time and it was years ago.  I was there on a first date with someone and while we had a decent meal, we did not have chemistry and it took me this long to return to the restaurant!\n\nAnyways, back to my latest visit... our waiter, Maurizio, was just attentive enough and had the cutest Italian accent.  Doesn't everything sound sexy when spoken with an Italian accent?\n\nOne bite of the fresh bread and olive oil, and we knew we were in for a treat.  I started with an \"insalata Veneto,\" which was very good.  My aunt and uncle had the vegetable soup (they were out of minestrone) and insisted I try it since it was so good... and they were right!\n\nFor our entrees, I went with the seafood special pasta of the day which was exceptional!  They shared an order of the ravioli and the gnocchi and loved them both.\n\nWe all shared a Crema Cotta for dessert.  Crema Cotta is Veneto's version of crème brûlée with wild berries.  Deeeelish!  I will not wait long to return to Veneto Trattoria again.  Highly recommended for anyone that is a fan of Northern Italian Cuisine and homemade pasta.  Look past the strip mall location and check this place out!
