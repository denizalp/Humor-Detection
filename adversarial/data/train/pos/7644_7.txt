If you're a kitchen appliance junkie like I am and like to cover every square millimetre of your coveted counter space with beautiful and shiny wares, you will adore Cayne's Housewares. I can't speak to the store's facilities as I've never been inside - I strictly order from them online as shipping is cheap (around $10-15) and the prices are unbeatable. \n\nI've purchased Kitchenaid mixers, juicers, blenders, food processors, coffeemakers and the like from Cayne's and I've never seen their prices matched. Normally what I do is check Amazon's reviews and then see if Cayne's has the item, and then I gasp at the low price before my eyes. Seriously - if you need small kitchen appliances, there's no reason to ever order from anywhere else. Online ordering is quick and shipping is immediate; almost as efficient as going to the store without that pesky drive to Thornhill!
