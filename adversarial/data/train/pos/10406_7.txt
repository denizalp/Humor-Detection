I think that everyone really needs to know the ugly truth behind #Ruby Tuesday. They do NOT want children that are special needs in there restaurants we were treated so poorly. I contacted them and we never heard back from anyone. I can show anyone the message that were sent and opened by them without any response back. Please take a stand for our kids that are special and reconsider before eating here.
