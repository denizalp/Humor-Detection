Very Cool Mom and Pop restaurant serving some delicious and very affordable middle eastern food. You can dine inside their cozy restaurant or have them fix you up for some tasty take out.\n\nBelieve or not we used to live right behind this restaurant before they built the SR51. Sure wish they were here back then. We could have easily walked right up or taken our bikes and had one of those stimulating Green Earth experiences.\n\nCame in here the first time and went with the standard Gyro combo with fries and a drink. Caught an eye of the Baklava sitting nearby and had to also get one of those bad boys. Food was very tasty and I made sure to bring the wife back for a return visit.\n\nThe menu is pretty good sized and has all the popular favorites that you can imagine. Gyros, Kababs, Shawarmas, Falafel, Hummus and then some. I also really like the take out menu. It is nicely done and has several pictures of all the different items. Nice!\n\nThe owners are both super friendly and excited when you arrive. We even talked baklava recipes for a moment while we were settling up. They make theirs the same way we do using pistachios and a touch of cardamom and a hint of rose water in the syrup.\n\nRight next to the large movie theater in the adjacent Rad Shack parking lot. See you there next time. KEEP IT LOCAL WHEN CAN!\n\n4 STARS
