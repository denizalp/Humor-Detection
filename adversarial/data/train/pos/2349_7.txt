I'm not a big mall person I prefer to shop on line, so when I do venture out to the mall I have to treat myself to an Auntie Anne's pretzel! \n\nThey seem to get a little more costly every time I buy one; weighing in at a whopping $5.87 after tax for the large cup of pretzel nuggets, they are a great hold me over until dinner snack! \n\nI love the pretzel varieties cinnamon sugar, salted, plan and pepperoni. You can add one of seven dipping sauces for an additional $.95!  \nIf you're thirsty may I suggest a swig of their old fashion lemonade, it's delicious!
