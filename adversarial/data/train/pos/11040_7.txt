Flavorful \/\/ Quick Eats\nCasual \/\/ Filling \n\nWandered in here after reading some of the reviews definitely a notable spot worth visiting if you're in the mood for Asian and something quick. \n\nEnjoyed the dishes that we tried here. Pork and beef were tasty and the kimchee fries. The papaya salad was fairly large and we over ordered. We were supposed to be restaurant hopping but this place put us into food coma so a walk was needed after!\n\nThe Scene: Hip, Asian, Modern\nDestination Rating: 8\nDate Rating: 8\nHob Nob Potential: N\/A\n\nStrong Suggestion: Buns are excellent, lots of shopping nearby.
