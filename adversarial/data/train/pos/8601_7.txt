I decided to give this place a try as a little preview before I tackle the chef's other restaurant. However, I was a little disappointed in L'Atelier. I have had my fair share of fine dining, not only do I believe I am paying for the food, I also believe I am paying for the service. That was not the case here, I find their customer service skills to be very poor. The waiters were very UN-attentive. I am not sure if it was because we had a late reservation and it was already towards the end of the night. Even then, for one of Joel Robuchon's restaurants I would expect fine service.
