Here's a great place you will actually get excited about eating French Onion soup! Yes it's that delicious. Wow!\n\nIn addition their Prime Steak Classique was very tender and full of flavor. It comes with fries so I asked to replace it mashed potatoes. This is where they lost a star since they didn't get this right the 1st time. And I needed to wait awhile to get this fixed. Once I received the mashed potatoes, I was a lot happier since they went so well with the steak. \n\nIf you in the mood for a salad, I highly recommend their SALMON, SPINACH & BABY KALE Salad. \nIt is very delicious too!
