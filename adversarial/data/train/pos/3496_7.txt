$20 per hour! That's their big selling point! I was kind of skeptical, but they actually did a very good job. Full body massage, including head, and they even did a hot stone scrub on my back at the end. \nThere are just a few minor quirks I should mention just for the sake of being complete:\nYou are in one big room with many other people getting massages. So if someone dozes off and that person is a snorer, then you might not have the \"spa feeling\" that you think you might get. Also, the therapists try to almost hustle you for a big tip so don't be surprised. But seriously, don't just tip them $5. Anyways, at this price, you can live with these quirks. Enjoy!
