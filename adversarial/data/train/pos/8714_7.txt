Welcome Mr. Tea! \n\nYou're the new guy on the block, you got your fresh new ideas, almost California hipster coffee shop-esque vibe, somewhat close to Chinatown, but far enough from competition. Your focus on fighting the powder, making drinks from scratch, and using fresh quality ingredients is a nice change of pace for most of Vegas. Although oddly similar to Boba Guys you do make your own product in house so kudos to that. The light bulb cup is amusing but the split cup is great!\n\nStrawberry matcha latte was cool, but not for me. Menu and flavors is more \"limited\" than your traditional boba spot but because the ingredients are fresh. Fresh pineapple, fresh kiwi, and a fresh you. \n\nYour service is great, your place is clean, your prices are managable (less than $5) and you have wifi. Keep doing you and the people will come, except perhaps consider rewriting your menu board, it is kind of crooked.
