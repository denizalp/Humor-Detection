Like Tom Cruise in the '80s, this place has all the right moves. I really look forward to eating here whenever I get a chance.\n\nThe menu isn't huge, but everything I've had is made perfectly. It's the kind of food I categorize as simply delicious: you can taste ingredients, it doesn't feel over done or over wrought. Very easy to enjoy.\n\nThere are plenty of tasty items for vegetarians, from hand made pizzas and salad to soups and grilled cheese. I typically get  a grilled cheese and whatever their vegetarian soup of the day is, and the only disappointment is when I've reached the bottom of the bowl. \n\nSince the restaurant space has both booths and tables, I imagine it can accommodate a larger group, though I always recommend calling a restaurant ahead to ask their advice, if that's what you're planning. If you're on a work lunch, expect an ok turn around on getting the food on your table, but I'm not sure you can do it if you are on a 30 minute break. I recall it takes at least 45 minutes from order to finishing your meal.\n\nThe Porch has a really comfortable, modern space that is welcoming. Wide windows let bright light into the expansive dining room. It's a detail so small, but I love the cloth napkins that they use that look like a smaller version of a kitchen tea towel. You'll order at a counter when you come in and seat yourself, but don't fret: there are servers\/busers that peruse the dining area to bring out your food, refill waters, and attend to anything else you might need. They have been very friendly in my experience. I'm so looking forward to spending some time on Porch's porch when the warmer months hit. I expect it to be lovely to hang around Schenley Plaza with a refreshing drink, excellent food, and good company.
