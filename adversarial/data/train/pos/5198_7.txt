Valet was full, had to self park and pay the same price as their valet even though we were going to their club. First time at the mint and the front entrance guy said he's never heard of Yelp or the offer on the Yelp profile. Please take it down or delete your business profile from YELP. The general mgr or business owner shoulder educate this guy. Tries to sell us bottle services and we left their club in less than an hour, it just wasn't happening. Many more clubs on the block.
