This place is great if you want cheap furniture. \n\nWe got a couch and a chair w\/ ottoman in reasonable condition for under $50 incl. tax! Now we only bought this stuff because we're moving in less than a year and didn't want to move a bunch of derelict pieces nor buy something expensive only to be thrown away next June. But it all cleaned up well and is exceedingly comfortable. Who cares if it our living room looks like a combination of the sets from Top Gun (the bar where Maverick and Goose serenade Charlie with that oh-so-famous song) and the living room from Legends of the Fall (that's right, 'Screw the Gov't' Anthony Hopkins with bear-fur jacket and chalkboard\/necklace reading 'Am Happy' not included).\n\nEnter New Vista Emporium Store. Great selection of mostly good used stuff. Incredibly affordable prices, and the man behind the counter was great. I wish I had gotten his name, because I swear if i ever direct a movie I am going to cast him as the protagonist, hands down. He had the looks of an older James Dean, the swagger of a younger Paul Newman and a little something all his own. Get that man an agent, he should be in pictures.\n\nThe housewares and clothes were less than impressive, but the prices cheap. Take a look, you might find that pair of Wranglers and Cowboyboots that you've been pining for ever since you saw Keanu Reeves aka Johnny Utah run down the bank-robbing, Bodhi-setva in a Ronald McReagan mask. I'm talking Point Break, people, don't pretend you've never seen it.
