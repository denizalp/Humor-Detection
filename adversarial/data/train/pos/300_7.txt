Came to the ABC store to check out some stuff. I didn't get snacks here so we went to The Beef Jerky store. \n\nI love all the stuff they sell here ranging from clothing, key chains, snacks, jewelry and so much more. Last time I came here, I spent almost $100 on souvenirs and snacks. They carry the Hawaiian Sun drinks which I love. They also have chocolate covered macadamia nuts. So much you can buy here. \n\nThere are certain items that are on sale, so you really have to look around. Towards the back, they have Hello Kitty items such as bags, key chains and so much more. I literally can be in this store for hours just looking around. \n\nStore is clean and I believe there are two cashiers up front to assist you in checking out. I highly recommend checking this store out and looking at all the cool stuff they have. I wish there was one in San Diego! Awesome store!
