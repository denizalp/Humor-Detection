Very disappointed. I had been very appreciative of the high level of customer service at this specific location for Sin City Vapor, up until today. I've spent a lot of money with Sin City Vapor, and really had never thought about checking out a different vapor store, until I was treated poorly today. I'm experiencing an issue with error codes my ProVari is throwing about 60% of the time when I try to hit. I came in today to seek help and a possible solution and was given a response of, \"Well, I gave you a manual, right?\" Yes, she did... And, I referred to that first before coming in. She blamed the issue on the tank I'm currently using and said I should try tightening and loosening it, it will solve the issue. No, it doesn't, I've already tried that and have been using this tank since I first purchased the ProVari. It wasn't until about 4 days ago that I started experiencing the issues, and I've been using the ProVari for over 2 months now. I asked if there were any other suggestions she had and was told to contact ProVape because nothing was covered through Sin City Vapor. Great, thanks for the 'help' with the product you sold to me and now refuse to stand behind, even after the amount of business I've given you; I'm so very sorry to have wasted YOUR time!
