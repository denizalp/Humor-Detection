Ahhhhh...TI knows how to treat a lady like me! Big spacious rooms, free complimentary bottle of champagne just because I'm a fly bride to be, dope fast room service, and the Cirqu De Solei show.... OUT OF THIS WORLD! \n\nThis was my first time EVER staying in a \"real\" hotel in Vegas that wasnt cornered between a delux Wendy's drive thru and a hooker-pimp hang out, so needless to say Im pretty easy to impress. But THIS was just amazing! Got a kick ass deal on Groupon with the most beautiful view of the strip, 2 tickets to the show, big fluffy bed and just great service all around! I was impressed from start to finish! Even when my TV was acting up they sent a tech from the actual cable company in to fix the problem within minutes of my call... \n\nTHUMBS UP TI! I cant wait to come back
