A nightmare experience with Dr, Richards. He intentionally bruised my face by squeezing the area he had just injected with his fingers.  Was an hour late; the room was dark, the realtor-nurse smeared my face with the numbing cream like she was icing a cake. When the doctor arrived, the effect of the numbing cream had passed. Dr. Richards injected my face carelessly, with complete disregard to the sensitivity of my skin. On top of it, he left my face black and blue.
