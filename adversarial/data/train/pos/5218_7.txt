I don't know how they make those hotcakes so thin but fluffy, but those were some of the tastiest things I've ever eaten!\n\nThere were seven in my party when we got there at 9:30 on a Saturday and there was a huge line outside, but they really turn over the tables so we only had to wait about 15 minutes and I would have been happy to wait even longer.   Everyone loved their meals, esp the malted waffle and those hotcakes.  I had the chocolate chip banana hotcakes and I'm not kidding when I say I can never eat pancakes again.\n\nService is fast and friendly.   If you like breakfast and you're in Pittsburgh, you should really make sure you visit Pamela's.
