Some yoked out guido accidentally punched me in the head. He was trying to hit a guy , missed, and got me instead. My hat went flying across the dancefloor and I was totally disoriented for a few minutes. NOT my kind of scene. Then again, this kind of stuff always happens to me.  Security took quite a bit to clear up the situation. Luckily, some Jolly Green Giant tall guys \" rescued\" me and pulled me into safety. \nI still had a good time because I was with friends and family. It just reminded me of how much I love the low key life.  :)
