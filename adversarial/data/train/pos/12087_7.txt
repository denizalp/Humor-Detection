This location was excellent! My all time favorite experience with the Pomo family.Entering the front entrance to the lobby was warm and welcoming and continued into the dining area. I love the open lay out. There is a small break between the bar area just to distinguish the two but nothing dramatic. The windows are floor to ceiling all around you so you can see out to the patio, which I love.  It's safe to say I was a big fan of the ambiance, set up, and whole feel of this place.\n\nMy friend and I were greeted by a young Italian man who served us through the night. I wish I would have gotten his name. He was funny, charming, and very attentive to all our needs. I had a glass of the house red wine. It was mild bodied but not too sweet. I would order it again. When the time came for us to order we knew we wanted to share a pizza and a pasta. We decided on the TOTO SAPORE: tomato sauce, mozzarella, italian sausage, cotto-ham, spicy salame, pancetta, salame parma, basil, evoo * 16.95 - It was perfect! The crust stayed crunch, and had a  bit of char on it, the meat's didn't over power one another, and you were able to get the fresh basil taste throughout.        And for our pasta, we just weren't sure what we wanted. We asked our waiter what he recommended and he pointed out the STROZZAPRETI ALLA SALSICCIA: fresh pasta w\/tomato sauce, italian sausage, light cream, rosemary & parmigiano* 15.95 - I've never had a more delicious plate of pasta in my life. If this is what homemade pasta tastes like... I wish I would have had an Italian grandmother. That's all I could think when enjoying this dish. \"This is what it would taste like if I had a grandmother, who was from Italy and made pasta from scratch. No doubt about it.\" I do not know what type of pasta this was but it was a little bit chewy in the middle (I think they call that Al Dente... haha. :) ) something I very much enjoyed. The pasta sauce was thick and hearty. The sausage was season and cooked to perfection. That perfect amount of rosemary in every bite was fantastic. \n\nAfter the server boxed up our 1 slice of pizza and our 3 spoonful's of pasta left overs. (I was not about to waste one bit.) We ordered the cannoli's. Something I'm not a hug fan of in general but my friend very much enjoyed. Crunchy outside, gooey inside, Nutella and strawberries to garnish the plate. \n\nAfter we paid and got up to leave, there were several servers and hostess's in the lobby smiling with a \"Ciao Bella's!\" as we walked out the door. What is better than that!?\n\nI'm so glad I gave this location a try. It's everything I have been looking for in an Italian place and I'm so happy it's oh so close to home. I can't wait to go back.
