The \"Party Pizza\" is really the only recommendation I have.  It is fantastic and deserves 5 stars.  The staff and the delivery people that they have also deserve 5 stars. I'm giving 4 stars because sometimes if you order the smaller sizes, it comes with too much crust on the edges for my liking.  I have called in about it and they say \"make a request to put the sauce and cheese to the end\". The times that  I have remembered to do that, it has been fantastic. My question is \"Why should you have to ask?\" I just preferred it when it wasn't  required \"to request\" but apparently like many businesses, they are trying to cut costs.  This is however, one of the best pizza places in East Mesa and it is especially popular with the teenage crowd.  All the teenagers love this place!  The pizza is really great fresh and hot but not so much reheated, so order an amount that you will eat.  Just an FYI.
