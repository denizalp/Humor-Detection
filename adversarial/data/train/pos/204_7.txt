Did Caesar himself immerse under such tranquility during his uprising and most victorious era? S e r e n e  &  t r a n q u i l  are the only ways I can describe Qua Baths & Spa of Caesar's Palace - a complete capacity of a being. Given that I just had a full evening attending several events throughout the night and did not sleep until the wee hours of dawn, Qua Baths & Spa is just what I needed.\n\nEntrance Fee for Caesar's Palace guests: \n$25 on weekdays\n$35 on weekends\n\nThe experience is worth it. You are lead to the dressing room by the attendant and given a tour of its luxuries - dry, wet, and arctic room saunas (with snowflakes falling!), hot stone beds, several Roman baths, a waterfall, and my favourite, the tea room. The steam rooms and Roman baths are swimsuit optional, but I prefer going au naturale; flaunt what you have. Showers, the water closet, and even the vanity room was so impeccably clean and there was always someone attending and restocking towels, cleaning after each person, and maintaining all its beauty products. I appreciated the tea room for its abundance of fresh fruits, coffee & tea, and lots of water for rehydration. Bring a book to read, you can easily find yourself spending hours at this Roman bath house. It was just too serene that I had to spend just another day here before we departed! x
