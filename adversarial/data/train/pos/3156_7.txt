Taco bell is far better than Del Taco.  And Taco Bell is not good either.  Nuff said.  Oye, I ordered the Macho Nachos without meat and ick!  The beans were a soupy mess, the sour cream looks like it came out of some sort of canister and twisted around like a snake on top of my chips, and the cheese was a nasty, salt laden, festering lagoon of orange goop.  AVOID AVOID AVOID!!!
