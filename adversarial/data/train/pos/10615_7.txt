I will not use Porter again. I booked travel from the US to Montreal on Porter and they double charged me- 2x $800. I noticed immediately (since I'm not exactly wealthy- hey, I'm flying Porter) and called them. The bank told me there was nothing they could do to help, I had to call Porter and get them to reverse it. Meanwhile $1600 is now gone from my account when I only purchased $800 worth of airfare. After spending a considerable amount of time on the phone on hold with Porter I finally got through to an agent. The agent made it pretty clear they could not care less about this situation, and that \"eventually, in 7-10 business days, the problem should correct itself.\"  Really? You think being without an extra $800 of my own money for 7-10 business days is ok with me? I didn't even receive an apology until the third or fourth call. My bank told me if Porter called them and confirmed verbally that the second charge (which was put through seconds after the first charge) was a double bill, they could void it. I asked Porter to do this, and was brusquely told \"we don't deal with banks.\"\n\nIt took 2 weeks to get that money back. In the meantime, I was only able to make rent and other bills by moving money out of my savings account in order to cover the giant $800 hole. I was angry enough to cancel my flight and not go at all, because Porter handled this so poorly and was not deserving of my business.
