Can you say Gypsy Queen?  Bohemian gypsy casual woman's clothes and accessories.  Small store, a few sale items but original price is steep. I like to come in and browse.  I do own a few items and the quality is superb, soft cottons that wash over and over and lace on sweaters that fit just right.  Love to splurge on a few great pieces that I get my money's worth out of like jeans!  You can find this brand at Macy's too but more selection obviously here.  Stop by:)
