I guess I'm alone on this one but I enjoyed this place! We came here this past weekend (on valentines day and the 3-day weekend) and it was really easy to get into (free too)-- probably because it was just me and my boyfriend. The bouncer was really friendly and let us in after about a 15 minute wait. Right when we entered, I was digging the whole vibe... it was very dark, black, and red (maybe just for V-day?) My boyfriend kept complaining about how small the place was but from what I remember, I thought it looked really big. Ok maybe I was just buzzing after my 3 jagerbombs, but whatever. My only complaint was the music. It was electronica for a good like 30-45 minutes, and then the DJ started playing songs but only like 3 lines from a song, and then he would switch it. Oh and also, the security guards were being bitter bobby's who had to work on V-day and got jealous of all the couples. I seriously was just hugging my boyfriend and he said \"OK Get a room you two. Move it somewhere else.\" OKAY seriously?! Go tend to the other 329482309 couples getting freaky deeky on the dance floor. sheesh!
