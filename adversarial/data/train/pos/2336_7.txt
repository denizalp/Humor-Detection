Came here a few weeks ago with some work friends for a goodbye lunch.  Still lots of aloha spirit at Island Style!\n\nI was feelin' the Korean vibe that day so I went with a staple, the Bi Bim Bop.  Rice topped with bulgogi beef with lots of veggie sides like pickled carrots & daikon, bean sprouts, spinach, and cucumber, all topped off with a runny sunny side up egg, sesame seeds & seaweed!  Comes with a side of broth too for pouring over.  Delicious!  Love that runny egg yolk combining with the hot rice & bulgogi, then getting the crunch from the cool veggies.  That's some good eats!  I should have opted for a dollar or 2 more for the Bi Bim Bop in the hot stone pot, would have been sizzling hot from beginning to end.\n\nIsland Style has the hookup for banchan too!  Who else in town served boiled peanuts as banchan?  Such a good start to a meal.  I had no shortage of other banchan either - kim chee, kim chee cucumbers, bean sprouts & more.  Sides to my hearts content!\n\nI also got a Cheeseburger as well.  Surprisingly simple & tasty!  Flat top grilled meat, cheddar cheese, fresh lettuce & tomato, bun.  And lots of mayo & ketchup just the way I like it!  Opted for no fries, needed to keep the calorie count down LOL.\n\nIsland Style I'll be back again when I need me some down home eats!\n\nHawaiian!  Oh....and Korean!
