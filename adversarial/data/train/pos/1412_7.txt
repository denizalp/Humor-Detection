First, I have to admit that I do not like LA Fitness. Their employee turnover is too high to feel like a neighborhood gym and their demographic is disproportionately meatcake-y. But then, that's LA Fitness...\n\nI like this location, though. It is sort of beat up but that makes it much better. It is rarely crowded, no matter the hour, and it seems to attract down to earth, friendly people just looking to get healthy.\n\nThe bottom line: I'm serious about my workouts and I can go in, use the weights without too much of a fight, get a good workout without interruption, and leave.\n\nIt's reminiscent of Average Joe's in the movie Dodgeball. If they'd replace one of the sales staff with a pirate, I'd probably give it one more star.
