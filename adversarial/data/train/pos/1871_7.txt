I chose Dr. Kovac specifically as a certified practitioner of ART. When I expressed my irritation with his being 15 minutes late, he suggested I could have seen another provider, one not certified in ART. After claiming several times to have read my intake, but insisting on asking me questions that had already been answered, I had decided that I wouldn't return for a second appointment, but when he started talking about the injuries I might have sustained from the \"airbag,\" I actually walked out. I cannot work with a chiropractor who either lies or doesn't understand that motorcycles don't have airbags.
