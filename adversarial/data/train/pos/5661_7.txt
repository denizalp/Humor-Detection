We lost our sweet baby girl kitten, Penelope yesterday. She had FIP, which is fatal for cats. We are heartbroken and the sadness is excruciating. We have not stopped crying or looking at photos & videos of our baby. She was too young. \nI found this place through Yelp. The gentleman I spoke to on the phone sounded very kind, so we decided to take her here. We dropped her off yesterday. One of the hardest things to do. Honestly, holding her lifeless little body before we left, for a moment we considered taxidermy. But it woundn't be her spirit and eventually it would be too morbid a reminder. So we kept to our original plan to cremate. The lady who helped us was nice, but a bit more practical than the gentleman we spoke with. I guess you have to be in this business.\nWe instructed them to clip certain areas for her fur patches. We also ordered 2 heart shaped urns for each of us to have.\n\n ****Updated****\nWe picked up Penelope today and were very pleased and happy. They included a Rainbow Bridge poem along with a certificate of cremation. We especially loved her paw print in a frame.\nWe don't want to come back here for a very long time but would recommend them to anyone who needs their services.
