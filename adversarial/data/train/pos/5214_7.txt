I think there are a few reasons that Rol San is one of the most reviewed spots for Dim Sum in Toronto (location, amount of seating, location, they offer Dim Sum all day, and location).\n\nIs it the best DS I've ever had? No no, it checks the boxes, looks and tastes mostly as it should but compared to some of the spots north and west of the downtown core, it's definitely nowhere near as good. I will say that they perform very well on items like Sui Mai, Har Gow, Chicken Wings and BBQ pork buns. \n\nDue to the fact that it's in Toronto it follows why the price per order is nearly 1\/3 to 50% higher than places outside the city. The average cost of a basket of items is about $5 vs $2 - 3.50 outside the city. We ordered a variety of items and our bill came to over $100 for 3 people - easily the most I've ever paid for Dim Sum @ any time of day. \n\nI mentioned location because it is super convenient right in the heart of Chinatown on Spadina so there is no shortage of foot traffic here, and the fact that they offer Dim sum all day AND the venue is HUGE inside, are all contributing factors as to why Rol San has such a large number of reviews (average in rating however) over most other DT TO spots.\n\nWould I return, sure. I think there are better options in Toronto and outside the city in terms of price and quality, but if I'm in the area and get the DS itch, I'll be back\n\nEatcret Out
