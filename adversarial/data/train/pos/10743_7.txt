Poor customer service! \nMy water treatment system broke and so they came out to do a service call $75 charge on Monday. They remove the filter tank and left the drainage hose out instead of putting it back in the brine tank. Rob says we will call you today but this should be covered under warranty. I had to call them Thursday as there was no call back and they said oh yeah we were going to call you and we will have them bring the tank back today. No mention of another service fee. During the week the brine tank had chosen to empty itself through the tube that was left out and there's is now salt all over my garage. I notified the scheduler of this as well as the service guy who saw it. John says it'll be $75 again so I paid as it's not johns fault... I called the next day to speak to the service manager and he said it is always 75 to have anyone come here- even if their part broke under warranty- and all he could say was sorry about the garage but that's all he had. \nSo they suck in this particular case and I'm sorry I even bought the more expensive tank in the first place but I would expect the service would be better especially since all they did was sell the tank and this is the first issue they've had with it.\nGo somewhere else.
