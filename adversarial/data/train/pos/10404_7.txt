Korean food open late. My type of place! They serve bar food type dishes like wings and skewers in addition to more traditional dinners. We had the dduk kochi\/rice cake in red pepper sauce, chicken gizzards, and spicy pork. \n\nThe dduk kochi texture was superb, with a lightly crispy exterior to contrast with the soft chewy interior. The spicy pepper sauce was slightly too sweet for me but I loved the spicy kick from it. \n\nThe chicken gizzards were... well, gizzards. The texture was very chewy but they were well seasoned and came with a side of hot sauce and sesame sauce. \n\nThe spicy pork was tender and flavorful with mushroom, onion, and broccoli.\n\nDrinks were refilled as needed and we were checked up on frequently.\n\nThe only annoyances were:\n\n1. No banchan offered prior to or with our meals.\n\n2. We were not given chopsticks but everyone else around us got them. Come on guys! Just because I'm speaking English to my husband doesn't mean I don't know how to use chopsticks!\n\nOverall though I'll be back again to try some more dishes.
