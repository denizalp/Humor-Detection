I don't usually write reviews for business that have more than a couple hundred reviews because, really, what's the point? But I really feel obligated to reiterate other reviews and praise this fine establishment. \n\nMarche Bacchus is one of my most favorite restaurants in the valley. (These aren't in order of importance.) \n\n1) it's not on the strip. \n2) its location right by the lake is almost unfathomable when you think of a French restaurant in Las Vegas! \n3) the ambiance of the restaurant is unbelievably romantic. The indoor dining area is beautiful. The outdoor area is absolutely gorgeous, especially at night. \n4) the service is always attentive and warm.\n5) the food is absolutely delicious. Try the duck (have it cooked medium), mushroom risotto (only if you absolutely love mushrooms and can appreciate specialty mushrooms other than white button mushrooms), escargot, meat and cheese plate, grilled octopus. Yes, I haven't had anything not good here. \n6) price wise: you get more bang for your buck. \n\nThey even do weddings here and they are so easy to work with. They don't charge you to rent the space, which is rare for such a beautiful venue. (At least they didn't about two years ago, not sure if they do now.) \n\nSo, yes. Bring your girlfriends here (not all at once, of course) and you shall be doing at least one thing right.
