The most awesome thing about this Fatburger is that they open 24 hours. We got hungry once at 2:30 am and decided to walk there. My 1st experience there's funny. When I walked in, I was greeted with non-stop rap songs. Also, there are so many ghetto people in there too, all shady looking. I thought we're gonna get robbed, shot or something lol.\n\nThe burger itself is really greasy. You can order the size you want (from S - XXXL) and can pay extra for additional cool toppings, such as chilli and fried egg (I'd recommend these). The burger comes with mustard, mayo, relish, shredded lettuce & tomatoes. The burger as a whole's pretty good. I like the toppings that they put in there.\n\nConclusion: The burger's pretty good. About the same with 5 guys, but definitely can't beat In-N-Out.
