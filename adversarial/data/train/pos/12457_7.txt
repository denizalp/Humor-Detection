I ended up cancelling my membership with Smart Gym. This partially had to do with my moving too far away from this location to feasibly continue any workouts on the weekends, but also had a lot to do with the changes in style. \n\nThey got rid of any yoga and floor exercise classes. Seemed kinda odd. They moved some stuff around, which was fine. And the space for floor classes was focused on XGT. I continued to use the machines as usual, but the feel of the place wasn't the same. \n\nI will say that it was relatively easy to cancel my membership. They asked my reasoning, I signed some papers, and only had to pay my last month charge (I was a month-to-month early sign on member). I never got hassled and didn't get any crazy additional charges. No big deal.
