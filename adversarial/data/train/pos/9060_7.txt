The only self respecting brewery in the Phoenix area.\n\nThe staff is knowledgable, the beers are unique and in spite of the harsh Arizona climate they aren't afraid to make big beers that range outside of the sessionable blondes, lagers, and low abv reds that have defined the region for me.\n\nOther breweries in the area put cute girls behind the tasting room's bar, who don't know a thing about the beer, and are only there to distract from the lack of creativity among of the beers themselves and overall selection.\n\nGo to Desert Eagle. They answered my questions. I met the owners. The brewer has self respect and passion in his craft. They have a bold selection of brews to choose from, all top notch... Some better than others, but not a bad beer here\n\nTry the: red, porter, RIS, XXPA
