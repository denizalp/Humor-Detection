There are many types of art -  classical, abstract, modern... The list goes on and on. One lost art, if you will, is the art of burger making. \n\nEnter Burginator. A hella local shop in the middle of Kensington Market who don't believe in freezing or using hormones to juice up the meat. It's all fresh. It's organic. It's grass-fed. \n\nBut that's not all. Ensure you eat at the Burginator when the owner is there to cook (off peak hours he's often not there).\n\nIve tried almost every thing on the menu, and folks trust my yelp experience when I tell ya the Big Bang is what you are looking for. But stop right there, don't just settle for the Big Bang! You need to ask him to put on Canadian Beef Bacon, herbs crusted cheese, and an egg on top! The burger becomes so big it's almost inedible... However as you compress the burgers between your two hands and bring that burger into your mouth you will understand the true meaning of life. As your teeth slice through each layer (burger, lettuce, tomato, beef, chicken, bacon, egg, sauce, cheese, etc) your taste buds will instantaneously ask \"what have you been feeding me all your life.\" \n\nEating this burger defies all logic. All boundaries are lost when your taste buds take over your emotions and you find yourself crying in happiness. This burger signals a renaissance to the current and future state of burgers.
