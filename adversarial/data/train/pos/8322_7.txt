Proof that a rose by any other name would smell as sweet.\n\nWhat exactly is it? There are so many names you will see in reviews: Babka, Chocolate Babka, Russian Chocolate Babka. Kokosh... I suspect people who have read about the charms of the dessert just point to the squares in a large metal tray behind the server and smile. It's certainly NOT \"the lesser babka\" (throwing in a Seinfeld reference for those who remember) ;)\n\nI understand that the correct name should be Kokosh, and the origin would be Hungarian and not Russian.\n\nWhatever, they're real ... and they're spectacular (ok, last Seinfeld reference). Warm. Gooey. Sticky. Uber Chocolatey. Crispy pastry layers. This is a pastry for serious chocolate lovers. Consuming it makes you laugh in front of complete strangers after realizing how good it is. Eating it makes you realize that you'd rather skip lunch for a 3rd (or 4th) slice of the pastry that morning. Lying in your hotel bed at night, it makes you debate whether you can squeeze in one more visit to Boulangerie Cheskie (pronounced \"Heshkie\") on your trip... not that any of these were personal experiences ;)\n\nIf you're not a chocolate lover (and I pray for the forgiveness of your sins), you can always try from the different types of rugelach. Also novel for me, the cheese crown: delicate, not as sweet as the other pastries, and a great contrast of textures between the exterior and interior.\n\nBoulangerie Cheskie is easy to find in Outremont. If all else fails: Follow the Black, White, and Felt... (4.5 stars, rounded up)
