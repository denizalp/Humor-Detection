Great hummus!!! This isn't the buttery Lebanese style hummus, rather, it has a coarser texture that is more than made up for with its bright, balanced lemony, garlicky, tahini flavor. \n\nThey also have mind blowing chicken shwarma-- very moist, marinated in spices. Mon cher chou had the chicken crisp-- basically shwarma meat in 2 pitas, pressed in a pannini grill until it is a crispy middle eastern chicken quesadilla. My daughter's meat pie was fresh and nicely seasoned. Great value for the money. \n\nThe reason they get 5 stars is their grape leaves. Most places make stuffed grape leaves as thick as a child's thigh wrapped entirely too many layers of improperly blanched leaves. THIS place makes delicate meat and rice grape leaves rolled as thin as your pinky finger in only the most delicate leaves. Add their thick tzatziki sauce, and you have heaven. \n\nThere is a great little grocery store and deli in the back, providing a well edited selection of middle eastern basics. The family who runs the place is fantastically friendly, warm and helpful. They also cater (they make boxed lunches for my daughter's school!) \n\nAtmosphere-- there really isn't any, but with food like this, who cares?
