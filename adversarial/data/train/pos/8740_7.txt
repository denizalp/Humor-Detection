I feel like I should be the judge of whether it is Yummy rather than being told by the restaurant name that it is Yummy. Is it just me? Yes? Just me? OK then.\n\nWell it wasn't really as Yummy as the name suggests. The dumplings were pretty good when hot, but they were not the kind of dumplings I have been spoiled by over on Spadina and near Spadina. They're fried dumplings, but not really the Chinese kind, more like the kind you'd expect on an appetizers menu at a bar, if bars did dumplings.\n\nAfter cooling down they went from pretty good, to bad and awful. If I went back here, it would not be for the dumplings, but the lovely service and exciting looking menu mean that I'll stick with a 4 for now. Next time, I'll try some of the Korean food I actually know I love, especially if they have Yuk Gae Jang.\n\nMaybe that can be Yummy Yummy in my tummy. Oh sh** I sound like Guy Fieri.
