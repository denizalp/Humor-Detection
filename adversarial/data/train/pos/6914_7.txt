I had a dream.\n\nI had a dream that someday, I'd give up my life here in SoCal.  I had a dream that I'd travel to the far reaches of Nevada and pursue my dreams of becoming a professional poker player.  I'd make big bucks from winning championship after championship.\n\nAlways, this dream ended with me taking up permanent residence at the Bellagio.  Always.  Did I mention the word: permanent?  Yes, I think I must've mentioned it.\n\nAside from being flat-out gorgeous, the service is top notch.  Yes, in Vegas, you'll feel like a VIP almost anywhere.  But what hotel actually caters to a green, naive 21-year-old as if she were the most famous socialite in the world?  Only Bellagio.\n\nThe rooms are simply elegant, with every pleasure and convenience you can dream up.  You will truly feel like a princess, I kid you not.\n\nThe rooms are fantastic, the service is fantastic, the actual hotel itself is fantastic - is there more?  Of course!  The food!  Bellagio has some of the best food I've had in the Vegas area, and again, the service is impeccable.  Their servers can even make chow mein and saimin seem like elegant delicacies, the way they carry on serving you. Shoot, i could probably order a street taco and it'd come with a gold-plated mini-spoon and monogrammed napkins.  Who knows.\n\nIs there more?  Yes, of course!\n\nTrue Vegas lovers do not go to Vegas for the shows, the hotels, the restaurants, or the nightlife - True Vegas Lovers go to Vegas to gamble.\n\nDuh.\n\nAll I have to say is... the dealers are all incredibly friendly and classy, some are also incredibly funny, and best of all, I feel like it's my lucky casino (so I always save it for last on my casino crawls).  Winner, winner, chicken dinner, bitches!\n\nOh, and it helps that, as Bellagio caters to a slightly higher-end clientele, the people who are playing cards with you are either (a) familiar with the rules of the game, or (b) well-mannered and fun to play with.  I hate playing with people with uncivilized tourists with bad attitudes. Blech!\n\nAnyways... Someday, my dream will come true.  Someday, y'all can write me fan mail and address it to Bellagio.  Thanks.
