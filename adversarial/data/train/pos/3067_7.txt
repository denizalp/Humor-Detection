If you value your possesions do not stay at this hotel!!\n I only have maid services while I'm in my hotel room watching. Needless to say after a midday swim my mom and I left our room to grab a bite to eat, I left the do not disturb sign in the key slot only to return to a clean room and my diamond necklace (it was an heirloom gift) missing.\n I immediately reported to hotel staff at the front desk. \nThe surperviosor on staff was very rude almost blaming me for leaving my items in my room unattended, but i thought that was what the do not disturb sign was for, to keep patrons\/staff out when i wanted considering I paid for the room afterall.\n\nLong story short, even after proving with hotel security staff that my room was enntered by the maid services with their key card while i was out my necklace never turned up, i received rude customer service by the management staff, and the police does not have jurisdiction over the hotel, ao they wouldnt even file a report!! \n\nWorse las vegas trip i have ever had!!! You've been warned.
