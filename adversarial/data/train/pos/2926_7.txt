This is a review for the carry out.  There is a whole dine in restaurant which looked OK in the Restaurant Row area.  It is very easy to get to while at Mandalay Bay and it appears to be open late night.\nThe pizza is ready to go - just pick your slice and they will heat it up.  It is decent quality and size, but not a tremendous deal.  My slice of meat lovers had plenty of meat and a nice crust.  I bought a slice, a water and a coke and it was like $20.  I am guessing the slice is like $10 at that total- not much for what you pay!
