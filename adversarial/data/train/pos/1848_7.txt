The worst pad thai ever!\n\nI ordered online and I was so disappointed I asked everyone at work to try it and they just threw it away \n\nI love food and I eat out all the time and big fan of yelp after i saw the good rating I thought it would be okay. \nIf anyone thinks this place is good, you must try Panna Thai restaurant, it taste just like you are in Thailand.
