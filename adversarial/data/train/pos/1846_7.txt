This is my favorite place in the area, and I would eat here everyday if I could. Their vegan options are extensive and amazingly delicious. The won-ton soup is vegan friendly too, at least that's what the server told me. Portion sizes are generous, the soy protein is to die for and the price is right. This place is a little piece of heaven for vegetarians and vegans, but omnis won't know the difference.\n\nI've visited this location a handful of times, and each experience has been nothing but pleasant. I have tried the fried mushrooms, the sesame soy protein, the orange soy protein, the sweet & sour soy protein, the wheat gluten veggie mix, the general tso soy protein and the hot and sour soup. \n\nMy favorite is the sesame soy protein, but I plan to try all of the soy protein dishes at some point. The wheat gluten is tasty, but it's not the best I've ever had. I prefer the meaty and solid texture of the soy protein over tofu and wheat gluten. \n\nThe spicy dishes are never spicy. You can always ask for extra chile paste like I do though. It's weird that they aren't spicy enough, but that could be because this area isn't as likely to have a preference for the spicy foods. \n\nMy last visit here on April 1st was definitely the most memorable. The sweetest young male was our server. He forgot sesame on our sesame soy protein, and he apologized profusely and fixed it. He kept bringing us refills, especially on my diet coke. Restaurants can be a little stingy with soda refills, but he was generous. He also gave us free rice refills, and since we all love rice, we were immensely grateful. I can't say enough good things about this kid, but I hope the tip we left him conveyed our gratitude.\n\nChina Palace is a win for sure!
