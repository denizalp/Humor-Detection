This is hands down my favorite Sheetz ever.  I've always had great service inside, and there are so many pumps.  You will never have to wait to get a pump here.  There has to be around 20 or so pumps, and it's usually priced competitively.  Sheetz food is pretty standard one place to the next, but my food always tastes made to order here.  If you eat in, the food is always hot.  It's very clean as well.
