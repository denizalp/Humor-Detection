I thought the art of horrible hospitality in the food industry was a form left to perfection in the Philippines and parts of Thailand...didn't think the dark cloud of attention lacking lethargy would follow a Filipino fast food chain straight across our border and into the heart of Las Vegas.\n\nAnyway, been here twice when I've craved a buko pandan shake and this was the only place to snag one (til I franchise my own Zagu). Both times consisted of customers waiting and waiting for their food with no one placing an order...which means they had adequate time to catch up if they were truly in the weeds (which it looks like they shouldn't have been). Read: Extremely slow help...took 10 minutes to get my shake.\n\nThe second time I came in was last Tuesday when they were about to close for a buko pandan to go...got my shake and realized there was a huge baseball sized object in my cup...hey look, an iceberg...no really...a huge baseball sized brick of ice. Was the person that oblivious to what they poured into the cup or did they think it was just for some child who wouldn't speak up?\n\nI went back the following week and showed the manager the pic on my phone and explained what happened...she immediately made another and apologized. Star added for quickly correcting last week's foul but I think it's time I buy my own pandan syrup and coconut milk and create my own...not returning for a third strike.
