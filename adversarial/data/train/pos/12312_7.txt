Got the Yelp Check In deal for 20% off the Super Deluxe bringing it to an amazing $16. Great deal in my book!\n\nFinally decided to get my poor Corolla washed one day and decided to give this place a try. Can't complain too much about a $16 hand carwash interior AND exterior. Solid place and I will definitely be coming back again. \n\nThey have a little sitting and waiting area for customers while your car is being attended to. I was told my car would be about 15-20 for the Super Deluxe and it was pretty true to the estimate. \n\nThere were a few blips with my car like a sticky (too sticky..) steering wheel from their product afterwards and whoever was wiping down my car missed a few spots which I had to point out before I left. Nothing too major though.
