Doesn't matter where in the country you are from, and that's including all of those proclaimed bbq capitals of the world, this is as good as it gets!!  Midwood knows smoked meats and absolutely slams side dishes!  Having visited more than this location, I can attest to the fact that they're consistent at any location.  Their smoked wings are just incredible, and without a doubt, are just the best I've ever had anywhere!  The smoked pulled pork and beef brisket or just as tender as can be and so full of flavor that I personally do not even have to add their house made sauce! The beef brisket salad is out of this world, and when combined with their avocado cream dressing, is just heavenly! From their Mack and cheese, to their barbecue baked beans, and their bacon wrapped jalape√±os, their sides are a winner no matter what you decide to choose! I have to also add that the staff at this location was just as friendly and helpful as it's been at other locations!  Midwood is the place for smoked meats!
