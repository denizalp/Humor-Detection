Oakmont Bakery is one of those places where you go in and are met with the instant feeling of \"OH GOD I WANT TO STICK MY FACE IN EVERYTHING HERE.\"\n\nOh, that's just me? Heh. Well, regardless, this place is amazing for baked goods. Their cupcakes are phenomenal and uniquely-crafted. The scones are perfectly crumbly. It's amazing. I wish I lived closer!\n\nSeriously, stick, face, everything, etc.
