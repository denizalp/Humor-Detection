Don't go here, they are only interested in money and DO NOT give a crap about your pain.  Dr. McJunkin is just that JUNK and only spent about 1 min with me and wouldn't even I prescribe more than 5mg oxycodone when I have a documented serious disorder with extreme pain.  My blood pressure was over 210 when I saw him on the 5mg pills he prescribed me.  If you want help with PAIN, this is definitely not the place for you!!!!! I can not stress this enough, go see another Dr. and do not go to Arizona pain specialists!!!!
