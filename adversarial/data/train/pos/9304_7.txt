My friend said this place was on triple D and he wanted to try it so we ended up going.  \n\nBig Jim's in the Run is essentially right in the middle of a residential zone.  It doesn't really feel like you are walking into a business at first because of the area you drove through to get there.  You will most likely end up parking on the street in front of somebody's home nearby.\n\nThis place has what I call quintessential \"American Italian\".  What that means is that it's not necessarily Italian but rather Americanized Italian food which isn't necessarily a bad thing but it's just not the same.  \n\nThe first thing you will notice is that the decor is very simple.  This place is the last \"D\" in the title of the show, \"Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives\".  This place is a dive and it's part of the charm of the place.  They are not trying to be anything outside of what they are besides themselves which is what makes this place genuine.  \n\nThe servings at this place are really large in that one dish can maybe feed 2 people.  If each of your party orders a dish you will most likely not finish your meal.  The salads are huge, the bread comes to the table at first the entrees will fill you up big time.  The food at the same time is good as well.  \n\nThe lasagna has A LOT of ricotta in it... almost too much.  The veal sandwich I ordered was almost the size of the plate!  \n\nAll that being said it's not a lot of money for a lot of food.  While it's not the greatest Italian food I've had it's one of the better American Italian food places I've eaten at and I can't say you leave hungry because the portions are beyond generous to the point of being family sized.\n\nThe service was very welcoming and friendly.
