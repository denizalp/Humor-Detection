This cute family business is perfect for dinner and desserts. Even some seemingly simple dishes are prepared with thoughtfulness. We ordered a foie gras appetizer that came with thin slices of ginger bread and marmalade. The richness was well balanced with the ginger and citrus flavors. The pork belly entree was perfect with the slightly sweet sauce. Dessert was also very special. Highly recommend this place!
