We saw a tourist-alert card for this exotic pet store that has MONKEYS, and we had some time to kill, so bf and I paid them a visit.\n\nUnfortunately, they didn't have any monkeys today (more to come in November-ish), but we did see:\n\nHedgehogs\nSugar gliders\nFerrets\nChinchillas\nA pink pig\nBunnies\nRats (with and without hair)\nPuppies\nSnakes\nChameleons\nTurtles\nKittens (boring, compared to the other stuff)\n\nThe card we had offered us a 10% discount on any pet purchase, but unfortunately I couldn't convince bf to let me take the pig home.  That round-bellied pinkness was the cutest thing there!  Unfortunately we couldn't pet it.\n\nI'd come back to browse this pet store every time I'm in Vegas!  Maybe I'll leave with a piggy sometime in the future.....
