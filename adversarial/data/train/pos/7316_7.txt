Customer service was great! \nThe sushi unfortunately was not. \n\nIt was bad. The rice was bad. The fish was bad. The sauces were bad. Even the tea somehow was bad. \n\nI don't want to be mean and put a place down, but I want people to know and not make the mistake I did. I'm a Las Vegas local, and if you're looking for ayce sushi or sushi just in general, choose a different place.\n\nIn conclusion, everything tasted bad.\nBut the staff was very nice, fast, and happy to serve it to you.
