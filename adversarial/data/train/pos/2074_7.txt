2nd part of tonite's, \" i'm in a shit mood so let me eat my way home .\" - saw some comments about LAs Pupusa in the past, it's on the way - what the heck.  I get a pork Pupusa and a chicken tamale - $3.50 - seems cheap .\n\ntook about 15 minutes to get the food ( i ordered to go ) - the restaurant is large but few customers - let's go !!!  take it home.\n\nIt's been about 30-40 minutes before i try both - still very warm \/ hot - that's a good sign.  The pork pupusa - tasty, could use a little more pork.  i wish i saw BK's review about having it cooked well done because those were the best parts.  The tamale - one bite - ehhh .  too damn greasy for me !\n\ngood price, good pupusa\n\nmy next stop was across the street - siena italian deli  - closed !!! are you shittin' me !! \n\nnext stop - Thanh Huong !!!
