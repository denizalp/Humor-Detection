Jenny was awesome! \n\nI had seen this shop when I was at another store and figured I would check it out..there's so many nail shops around me so why not try a new one.\n\nI called in to make sure they could take me and when I arrived they asked if I had called. I answered yes and they took me right away. They weren't busy so I didn't have to wait. They offered me water as I sat down for my first service. \n\nI had a pedicure done first. Prices are comparable to the other shops around. It was very relaxing. I liked how I didnt feel rushed, Jenny took her time and spoiled my feet. \n\nNext was my gel manicure, I had wanted white. She suggested a little design, the fade with a silver glitter. It came out super cute! I'm glad she made the suggestion! \n\nI'll go back to Jenny, she was super friendly and she took her time with my pedi and Mani. I hope they continue the service even when they do start to get super busy. That's one thing I have notices with the nail shops around, when they open they are all about service.  Then they start to pick up, get busy and then service tends to decrease. \n\nAnyways....I was happy. Thank you Jenny
