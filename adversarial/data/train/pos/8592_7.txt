Hot damn. This is by far the best Mexican food I've had in Cleveland and in the running for the best I've had in my life. Sure, it's in a slightly dumpy part of town, but at this point in my tenure in Cleveland, if that's gonna dissuade you from a fantastic food and drinking experience, then I feel sorry for you, fella. \n\nFor starters, you get bottomless chips and salsa (two types: spicy and spicy as hell) AND these sweet-ass pickled carrots. And as for entrees, the pictures of small plates on the menu won't make sense when you get about three pounds of hellaciously delicious actual food about 10 minutes later. I got the tortas platter because I didn't think I could handle the combination platter, and just the plain tortas were enough for about two and a half of my regular meals. I could have also eaten probably a bucket of just the seasoned rice and refried bean sides. \n\nThey say you can only get two of the following three at any restaurant: fast, cheap and great. This place proves that wrong.
