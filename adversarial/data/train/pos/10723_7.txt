If I ever get in an accident in front of this hospital, please take me to a different one. Too many bad stories to recount at this point with both my and wife's family. Not every employee is bad, but we've had way more than our fair share at this place. Had to fire doctors and nurses and had to advocate and raise hell to get things done. I have spent months in this hospital trying to help family members. Sometimes things just never get done. When a test is ordered and nothing happens for 3 or 4 days that's a bad sign. That's irresponsible and negligent. When it happens repeatedly it's a clear pattern of poor management and lack of accountability.\n\nMultiple long waits (8-12 hours) in the ER room, unnecessary catheterizations, doctor prescribed drugs that were on the patient's allergy list and they were administered in ICU of all places! Uncaring nurse who wouldn't give immediate family an update and flippantly said she \"wasn't worried\" only to have the patient pass away hours later.  Unforgivable problems. 20 strikes and you're out Banner Desert!\n\nDo your research. Pick a good hospital. There are some in town.
