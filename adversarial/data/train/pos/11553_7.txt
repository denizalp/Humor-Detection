Rather than try to stuff hungry patrons with over-riced morsels, like the rest of the sushi restaurants on Bloor Street, Japan Sushi has maintained its dignity.  With a slightly smaller menu than Sushi on Bloor and New Generation, it focuses on the star of the show - the fish.\n\nLet me explain:  if you ordered a set sushi meal at one of the other spots, you'd get something like a piece of Tuna, a piece of Salmon, a piece of fake crab meat and a clam.  Two of those are clearly filler (am I the only one who things that the clams at sushi places taste like the erasers we used to use in kindergarten?  Yup, I put those in my mouth, too).  Bamboo sushi at Japan Sushi, on the other hand, will come with two salmons, a tuna, a tai and a piece of melt-in-your-mouth white tuna.  See what I mean?  They are more generous and the fish I've had has always been excellent and fresh.  The Chirashi is especially good here.  Rice is also balanced and tasty, rather than thick, sticky and flavourless as can so often be the case in cheaper sushi places.\n\nSkip the line-ups at those other places and come to Japan Sushi.  It's much better.\n\nVegetarian score: 5\/10.  This is the one down-fall - the veggie options are less interesting here than some other spots on the sushi strip.  It really is a fish-lovers' paradise.
