Short and sweet, here.\n\nThis Sonic closes early, around 9 I think. The next closest one is the corner of Flamingo and Pecos, witch stays open until 11pm. Makes no sense, since you would think this one would be about the same \"busy-ness\" level.\n\nThey are the world's slowest Sonic, I swear. I have done both the drive thu and parked at the drive in. It takes forever to get served either way. No joke, one night, I sat in the drive thu for like, 15-20 minutes!! C'mon, seriously? I should have got a discount for the gas I wasted in idle.\n\nI have read reviews were they say sometimes it's fast, but I don't come enough to compare. I'm just talking about the three times I have gone.\n\nEverything I have ordered has come out perfect, so that's good I guess. But with that kind of wait, it had better!
