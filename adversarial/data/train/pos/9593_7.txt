There's always room for ice cream!!! Awesome little place to get some ice cream with unique flavours.  \n\nThe location was super clean, the restroom was clean and well kept, the staff was friendly and kind and attentive.  Adequate lighting and seating, and quite inviting.  \n\nCame here with my sister Joyce W. and good friend Wilson L.  We got the Strawberry Buttermilk which was fantastic.  The Earl Grey Tea which was very refreshing, and the Blue Cheese and Date, which was quite unique.  All was delicious and great.  The price was a little high but well worth the quality. \n\nOverall a great experience and will definitely be back when craving for ice cream.
