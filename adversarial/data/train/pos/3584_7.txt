1. Apparently there are 2 names in play here. They call themselves 'Tasty Island Caribbean Food & Deli' here but 'Tasty Island Jamaican Food Menu' inside.\n\n2. I walked in, it's a cluttered place, divey is the word, located on the corner of a strip mall. What normally would be a deli case is filled with boxes as you enter. There was no greeting from the 3 people behind the counter and towards the back.\n\n3. I go to the table - 2 placed together - to meet my fellow 3 diners. No menu provided, no service to the table.\n\n4. Only 5 feet from the counter, I asked the person behind the counter for help. At several points, nobody was present for service of any sort.\n\n5. The cashier\/order taker? When asked what was their best dish and what would he recommend, he basically said he didn't know. At another point, our table mates asked about the size of the dish and he strongly suggested they order the large size. They wanted the 'SM' size - they were right, he was wrong.\n\n6. We had a lot of questions of what was what, e.g. Calaloo, Ackee, Escoveitched Fish, Roti. The responding answers were only somewhat helpful at best. Frankly, I want the person working there to have a good idea of what items are and be able to suggest items.\n\n7. When asked about the Coco bread, he stated, \"It's just bread\" and he pointed at the loaf. \n\n8. We had a side order of a 'Beef Patty' which I thought resembled Cherry pie from 7-Eleven. I do not see\/taste the allure of it.\n\n9. Three of us had the Jerk chicken. The menu states all meals are served with peas - not true. None was provided.\n\n9. On the good side, the dead Jerk Chicken was normal and the rice was good. The Red Stripe beer was good as well.\n\n10. When the food came out, it was all in styrofoam with plasticware. Even at divey, hole-in-the-wall places, one normally gets plates and silverware but not here.\n\n11. In the end, it took about 10 minutes to obtain the bill, apply the discount, double-check on the split of who pays what part of the bill, and then finally receiving the credit slip to sign.  \n\n12. I've read some other reviews and I suppose, if there is a good dish that you like, e.g. Tripe soup, Oxtails, Ackee, Cowfoot Stew, Curry Goat, Salt Fish, go there and try it. Don't count on any service or explanations, or even suggestions. Or silverware. Or actual food in the deli cases. \n\n13. To be fair, my friends thought slightly higher of the place ... slightly.
