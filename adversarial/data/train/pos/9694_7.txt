Very opulent, romantic, and formal.. I can understand how Joel Robuchon was awarded 3 Michelin stars in 2009. Courtesy limo service and private mansion tour before dinner - beautifully impressive, distinguishing experience. You definitely have to account for the ambiance, presentation, production value as part of your EXPERIENCE.\n\nIt will be an unforgettable pricey night for a memorable occasion. The prix fixe menu (with supplement charges) is definitely the way to go, versus the a la carte options. It was a lot of food, as we got the 6 course, and 2 course menu and shared... bread cart, 2 appetizers, 3 main courses, 1 cheese cart, 2 desserts, 2 dessert carts, half bottle of wine, 2 cappuccinos. I was sooo stuffed - I almost popped out of my XXS Herve Leger dress, at the end of the night...\n\nThe food was extraordinary in presentation, and expected to be of high quality in tastiness, creativity, and exquisiteness. I guess I found the sauces of the sea bass a bit too salty, and the imported tender veal was delicious - but NOT memorable enough to order again, or leaving me to crave it like crazy.\n\nIt was about a 4 hour production, and I will have a lasting memorable experience, but the French cuisine didn't leave me dreaming of it, nor desirable enough to want to come back again. I still personally prefer Le Cirque, and absolutely LUV and crave their seasonal risotto dishes - which keep me going back. Again it's about personal taste...\n\nTheir courtesy moist lemon loaf cake was a classy touch, in the gift bag with brochure..
