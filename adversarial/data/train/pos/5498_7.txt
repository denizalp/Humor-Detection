What a great place to spend a few hours!!!!\n\nUnlike the roller rinks from my youth, the Crystal Palace on Rancho is extremely clean.  Seriously, even the carpeting is clean!  \n\nThey play great music, have a good deal for parties and serve pretty decent food. \n\nI highly recommend spending a day skating your heart out here!
