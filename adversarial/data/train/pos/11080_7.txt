Perfect show for date night. It was very entertaining throughout its 90 minutes. I think I loved it more than my husband did.  We like to explore all of the cirque shows on the strip and this one is probably my second favorite; the first being Le Reve.  The downfall is there was a lady sitting next to me that apparently couldn't stand the heels she wore cause she took them off. Disgusting. There was an open seat in between us and my husband wanted to put his suit jacket on the open seat but she stopped me saying \"I may sit there.\" I said \"excuse me?\"  She said \"I may sit there\". Ummmmm. Okay. Didn't know you paid for this seat too. I let it go. Until she ended up later putting her nasty bare feet on the seat next to me. It was too distracting that I just had to say something to someone to get her nasty feet out of my peripheral vision as I watch the show. Her presence wasn't the fault of the show so even though that was a bad experience on our seating area, the 4 stars I gave are solely based on the show. \n\nI would actually go watch the show again. It's that good. Plus, I'd like to experience it without sitting next to crusty feet lady.
