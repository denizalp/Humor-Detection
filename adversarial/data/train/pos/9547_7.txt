Awwwhhh, I LOVE this place!\n\nPart of what I love about Yelp and being a part of the Yelpyness is discovering little places off the beaten path. Sure, I will occasionally get my McDee's Sausage McMuffin on or even crack for the Endless Shrimp deal at Red Lobster, but what I love more than anything are the little mom and pop's, the hole in the walls and places like Palatte.\n\nWhen we headed over here today, I honestly thought my friend got lost. Hey, it's her town and what do I know, I am just visiting, so you will hear no backseat driver antics out of me. Finally we pulled up to this little house in the middle of a residential area and voila...brunchtastic fun at its finest.\n\nI don't even want to venture a guess at how crowded this place must get on the weekends judging by how busy it was at 11:30 on a Friday, but if you have the patience, definitely stop in here. The atmosphere is great, the people working here are super cool, the cooks have tats (yay!) and the food is awesome!\n\nI ordered the Potato, which basically translates to eggs, bacon, caramelized onions, gouda cheese and fresh fruit and yummy lightly buttered sourdough toast. It was just like something you'd make at home...if you were a really good chef and awesome :) Tasty, filling, but didn't have me feeling that after breakfast lull like most brunch places can.\n\nIf I lived in Phoenix this would be a must stop and quite often. Definitely check this out! You will love it!!
