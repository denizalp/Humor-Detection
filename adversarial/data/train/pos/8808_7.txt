My Sister-in-law got married and as we were staying in the Monte Carlo I suggested having a small reception dinner at Andre's because the concierge at the hotel said it was excellent.  We were a party of 6 and were having a very nice time until the staff pulled a real dirty fast one on me.  I swear if it hadn't been for this one greedy move I would be writing an excellent review right now.  A couple that were sitting behind us at another table offered to buy our table a bottle of champagne and we ordered a bottle of Veuve Clicquot.  We thanked them for such a nice gesture and went on with our meal.  When I got the bill I noticed that I was being charged for the Veuve Clicquot and when I questioned it I was handed a cheap bottle of Andre's Champagne and told that this was what the other patron had bought us and that the Veuve Clicquot was not the bottle that he had bought so I had to pay for it!  So my question to the waiter was then why was the Veuve Clicquot poured to me and my guests and not the Andre crap?  Why wasn't I told? I ordered the Veuve Clicquot right in front of the man who was buying the Champagne and he smiled and nodded and said \"enjoy!\" The lie that the waiter was telling me was one of the dirtiest things that has ever happened to me in any restaurant ever in my life.  I couldn't believe it.  I asked to see the manager and he somehow was not available.  So I held my anger, paid the bill took my \"crap\" bottle of Andre Champagne and left.  Did I look like an idiot tourist?  They sure treated me like one.  So for the rest of my life I will trash this lousy restaurant instead of praising it.
