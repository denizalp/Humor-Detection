Target located at the HORRIBLE Tempe Marketplace. This is a crippled version of typical Target stores, with a much more limited selection of products and confusing layout. They seem to be out of advertised items more frequently than other Targets.\nParking is awful and traffic flow is insane. The store is frequently jammed with ASU students, so checkout can be lengthy process during peak shopping times. \nThis store earns a 2nd star because it opens at 8am (really important in our super hot AZ summers). If I need to go to Targets, I usually go to the one on McClintock and Baseline or Southern and Longmore rather than endure the Tempe Marketplace nightmare.
