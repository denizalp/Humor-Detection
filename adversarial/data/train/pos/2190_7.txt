If there were a way to do a -1 star I would.  We were guests at this hotel this previous weekend and I would have to say this was one of the worst experiences I've had in Las Vegas.  This hotel has no concept of customer service.  From check in to the bars and restaurants, the customer service is slow and the staff treats you like you're a complete inconvenience to their day.  There was an incident that happened where their security harassed two of the ladies in our group, mistaking them for \"call girls\" and instead of dealing with this in a professional and considerate manner by simply asking the ladies to produce room keys, they embarrassed them in front of the friends they were speaking with and continued to harass them.  When TWO complaints were filed (one with Connie at the front desk and another with the manager who had the second shift at the front desk) we were assured that they would follow up with us on the incident....NO RESPONSE!!!\nThis behavior is completely unacceptable.  Obviously the Cosmopolitan feels that their trendy popularity excuses them from employing courteous staff and responsible people that hold their employees accountable for horrendous customer service.  I DO NOT recommend staying at this hotel.  Spend your money where customer service is understood and where your guests will NOT get harassed by their staff.
