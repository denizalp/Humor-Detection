There are very few places i'd trust to eat raw seafood.  I have a \"delicate\" digestive track.  That being said, Rodney's never lets down.  I've been going for over 10 years, and had them cater a party too.  True, it's expensive, but if you're out on the town for oysters, what do you expect?  they have a tiny menu, but what they do well, they do VERY well.  \n\nNormally when I go I just ask the waitress what's good and then ask her for a selection of all of that.  The shucking is also great.  I hate having sand in my oyster, but I've never had to worry about that here, as oppose to many other places I've tried in and outside of Toronto.  A good pilser, clam chowder and a rice pudding usually top off the meal.  The only thing I'd complain about, and it's not so much of a complaint as it is a \"hmmm\" issue, is that the tables seem very far apart.  It makes the experience seem a bit isolated - and sometimes I just have the feeling to tell my neighbour, \"hey, this is amazing, have you tried it?\"
