Lather and Shave is NOT a place you go to get a shave, it's one of Vegas' many shave ice spots located up in Aliante. Although their ice is not as fine as to what I'm used to ( I shave ice'd well over 100 times, born and raised in the shave Ice capital) I do like their use of all-natural ingredients in their syrups and lathers which is simply flavored soft whipped cream.\n\nOf all their selections I've tried, the Minion in me loves their Banana Cream Pie-Banana Syrup, Vanilla Ice Cream, and graham cracker bits topped with banana lather. The owners are great people, and their prices are very reasonable too. They even offer Pup Cups for your pooch as well. Dolce loved his Peanut Butter Pup Cup!\n\nStop by if you're ever in the Aliante area and need to cool off...Lather and Shave hits the spot! ALOHA!!!\n\nShaka Meter:  \\uuu\/  \\uuu\/  \\uuu\/  \\uu  3.5
