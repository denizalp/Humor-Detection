I am heading out of town for a wedding this weekend and I work very hard long hours and do not get off work untill 6pm. I needed a pedicure before this wedding and have been to Polished before and have been very pleased with their work in the past. My polish seems to last for weeks and my cuticles always look and feel great after a manicure. I will say however that the massage that goes along with the pedicure does not last long at all and don't expect to be pampered!\nNow back to yesterday when I was turned away for not having an appointment! I walked in around 6:15pm and the place was not more packed than usual and the girl behind the desk said if I did not have an appointment they could not help me. I been there on a Saturday when it's been way more packed and they have gotten me in and offered me wine!!!! They just did not want to be bothered yesterday or have to stay a little later. I guess they did not want my business, so I just went to Elegant Nail (not as fast paced or glam, but they were so sweet and they gladly took MY BUSINESS!!!!!!!!!!!!!).\nI will not be back to Polished due to this experience and some may think it is silly but business is business and if you are doing well enough to turn someone away then this small little YELP oppinion will not hurt you!:)
