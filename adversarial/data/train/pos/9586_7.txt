Really Yelp reviewers, 4 out of 5 stars? I came here based on this rating and I think everyone who rated this place over 3 stars should pull together and give me my $80 back lol. \n\nFirst, we came in around 3:30 on a Sunday and the service was not great. Halfway though an Asian chick took over our table and she was really nice so I'll let that go. \n\nWe ordered the spicy tuna roll, mariachi roll, pork belly ramen, sashimi salad and our kids had the fried rice and chicken finger bento box. The ramen was so bland and disappointing, it looked really pretty and we had high hopes. There was no real flavor, and what we did taste was just off. The spicy tuna roll was nothing special. The mariachi roll sounded so good but all we could taste was the sweet onion in it. It didn't taste anything like cilantro, salmon, salsa or any of the elements that were in the menu description. The sashimi salad was soooo bland as well. Just like eating basic lettuce with a hint of lemon. Very sad that both me and my husband's favorite thing was the iced tea, especially when it came out to about $80. Blah.
