I love Popeyes. Just not this one. Came in ordered 2 kids meals my 3 pice meal and popcorn shrimp for my lady. 3 min later all but the shrimp are ready. We eat and almost done when they bring the so call shrimp. All that wait for this see the photo. Not to mention we asked for the shrimp and the cashier said its almost out. But did not check, the shrimp had been sitting in the warmer for about 2 min before he got it. And told us the shrimp is ready. He did apologize for the wait but still wifey had to eat all by herself.
