3 WORDS: Frozen Hot Chocolate!  One feeling: satisfaction.  One honest response: sorta like a fudgesicle meets an iced mocha and mates to produce the ultimate chocolate lover's dessert beverage that does not disappoint!  I tried to go to the original Serendipity in New York City and it was difficult to get a table, but the 40 minute wait at the Caesar's location was a sacrifice I was willing to make just to experience one of Oprah's \"favorite things.\"  I went for lunch with my family and ordered the empire state onion ring tower, burger with brie, and shared the steak sandwich with 5 countries represented (America, France, Mexico, Japan, and Italy).  Here's a tip: order the sweet potato fries to get your palate ready for a sweet dessert.  Enjoy this one choco lovers!
