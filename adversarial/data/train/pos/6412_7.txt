My favourite place for Jamaican food!\n\nPrices and portions = great value and of course, when you add the authenticity of the food, it becomes a winning combination!\n\nAnother great thing I like about this place is that even though they have an extensive menu, I've never been told that they are out of a particular item.  Maybe it has to do with being attached to their own Jamaican grocery store but there is nothing more frustrating than having your heart set on something only to be told that they've run out.\n\nI also have a habit of ordering more than enough items for myself to make sure I have leftovers. The leftovers make great lunches at work I must say.\n\nI'm not going to proclaim to be an expert with Jamaican food but I've always enjoyed what I've ordered from here which is usually Jerk Chicken, Jerk Pork, Ackee & Saltfish, or Curry Goat and they have certainly matched, if not bettered those of the competition,
