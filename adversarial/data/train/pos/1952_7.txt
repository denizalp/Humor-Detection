Burt says Steak and Lobster at Red Rock casino -  Boom!\n\nBurt loves Red Rock casino.  Burt plays blackjack at Red Rock casino.  Yes Burt eats for free at T-Bones.  But Burts review isn't about the free food (because it's not really free, it was earned by risking Burts hard earned money at  the tables).    This review is about the fantastic dinner Burt had last night.  \n\nBurt has been to T-Bones a few times and always had a pretty good meal, but last night was a perfect meal top to bottom.   \n\nLump crab appetizer.  Awesome!  Burt might go back and just have 4 of these for dinner one night.  \n\nWe split a filet and a lobster tail.  Both were prepared perfectly.  Dover Sole was excellent.  Au gratin potatoes and Aztec style grilled corn were very tasty.  \n\nDessert Alert-  DEEP FRIED OREOS AND ICE CREAM!!!!!!!!  Hump Daaayyy, whoop whoop!\n\nLast night was a 5 star, but because of the other 2 \"good\" meals Burt has to average it out to a 4 star.  Burt will be back and hopes the 5 star meals continue and may upgrade T-Bones rating in the future.
