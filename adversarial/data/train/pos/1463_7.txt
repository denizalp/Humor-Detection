Dear La Piazza al Forno\n\nWe need to talk.\nI don't quite know how to say this so I'm just going to come out with it. \nI've been seeing someone else.\n\nHow long?\nAbout a year now. \n\nAm I in love with another?\nYes. \n\nWas it me? \nIt was. \nThe day you decided to remove hoagies from the lunch menu, about a year ago, \n\nI'm sorry, but it really was you...and not me.\n\nHey..wait...put down that pizza peel...try to stay calm...please?\n[Olive oil container whizzing past head]\n\nPlease! \nStop throwing shit at me...everyone breaks up on social media these days, or haven't you heard.\n\nWow, what a Bitch!
