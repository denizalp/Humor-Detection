At first this place was a pleasant place to go. Now it seems like the instructors are more worried about chatting with each other than teaching the kids proper swim techniques. Specifically one instructor Taylor is the loudest of them all. Watching her makes me sick to my stomach because not only does she disrupts the kids in the class but takes a lot of time away from the other instructors splashing them in the face and just yelling. I talk to other parents there and they cant believe that she actually works there. I am sure that some of the parents like her obnoxious attitude but when it boils over to other students its not fair for us to be paying money to a place that allows that. Very unprofessional and I think I will spend my money somewhere else. If I could give this place a zero I would.
