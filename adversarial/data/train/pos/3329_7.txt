You know what? I think vegans are really easy to please. This place is..MEHOK. \n\nIts got some some character on the inside, old kitchen tables that look like they're from the 70's, red booths, cool looking tattooed waitstaff, etc etc. Everyone around me was ordering the burrito so I had one, too.\n\nIt was sort of tasty - the way to describe it would be...taking some not so spicy veg chili and throwing it into a tortilla. Not very exciting. It was very liquid in its consistency- would have been nice to throw some rice in there and give this thing some body. \n\nThe side salad it came with was just some mixed greens and two slices of sugary canned tangerine (mmmm?).\n\nFor an extra two dollars, you can get a scoop of guacamole! Maybe two spoonfuls worth. Not great. \n\nShould have stuck with a Bitondo's veal sandwich. Infallible.\n\nPS:\nI noticed they were using the same shitty frozen fruit from Wal-mart that I use at home for smoothies. IF you're going to call yourself a juice-bar...use fresh stuff. And at least wash it first.
