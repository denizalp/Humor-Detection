Never get a cut by the woman here. If there is more than one female working here, this review is of the almost 50 y\/o that smells like booze at 9am, and coughs all over you. She had to have Mr. Rudd jump in to tell her how to cut hair. By the time he had intervened, it was too late. If you don't know how to cut the hair the way that is requested, why would you start cutting off hair? \n\nAsked for an undercut fade with the top not to be messed with. She cut off a ridiculous amount. Job literally required next to no scissor work, but she just started chopping away. \n\nPlace is really cool corner location with the awesome midwest downtown Main Street vibe, but the help apparently is beyond being helped.
