We've been using Blue Sky for years now and I don't see myself going with anyone else. \n\nAlways a fantastic experience. They have great drivers and always welcome you with a smile on their face.  Joe, in particular, is amazing.  It costs $2 more for covered parking which is worth the extra moolah because the summers are hot here.  Check for coupons, Groupons, and Yelp check-in offers for more discounts --- they usually stack them if you're being pleasant.  No lie though, I enjoy the coupons for a free cookie and a car wash too!\n\nThe lot is protected with a security guard on staff 24\/7 so be at peace when you fly out of state. Your car is safe here!
