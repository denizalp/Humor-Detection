We had excellent tortas in San Diego. We saw this place while we were in this neighborhood and we were hungry. They have \"tortas\" in their name so they would have good tortas, right?\n\nI wanted to try the Milaneza (breaded beef steak) torta but it wasn't available so I got the chorizo con huevo torta.  We also tried carne asada fries and al pastor torta.\n\nChorizo con Huevo Torta and Al Pastor Torta::\nComes with avocado, tomatoes and lettuce. Not enough meat and the bread was alright.  The chorizo torta had tiny pieces of chorizo and a fried egg. Quite spicy. The Al Pastor was tasty. 3.5\/5\n\nCarne Asada Fries:\nThe fries themselves were great. Crunchy and hot. Topped with sour cream, CHEEZ WIZ, carne asada and cotija cheese. I was going back and forth between liking it and not liking it. I was against the use of Cheez Wiz on this one because that's just not how you do carne asada fries. But does it taste good? Absolutely! 4\/5\n\nHorchata:\nI haven't had horchata I didn't like. Their version is good but a bit sweeter and reminded me of cake icing for some reason. 3.5\/5\n\nThey have tables on the side and a a drive-through. It's nothing fancy and the area is not the best. CASH only.
