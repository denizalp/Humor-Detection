This place is my ultimate favorite for Pho!!! \nThe place is always clean, super welcoming, and of course the Pho, the Pho is the best I have had in Arizona, as second best is Viet Kitchen and thirdly Angelina's!!! \nMust try if you are looking for the best Pho that Phoenix has to offer! :) Enjoy!!
