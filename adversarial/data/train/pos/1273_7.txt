My husband has been asking me to try Davitino's Restaurant for months, I finally gave in and I regret that I did.  We sat at the bar while waiting for our table.  I asked if they had Malbec wine and the bartender had no idea what I was talking about.  We ended up getting a Pino Noir instead. It was served in a non-red wine glass with a thick rim. I prefer red wine to be served in an appropriate glass.\n\nWe were seated in a booth at the back of the main room.  Our waitress was a sweetie and took our order immediately. I looked to my left and had full view of an area with brooms and cleaning supplies - gross!\n\nOur salad was served and it was just okay - nothing great. The flatware was pathetic and old. My husband's coke was served in a plastic glass. \n\nThe food was average and frankly I wouldn't go back.
