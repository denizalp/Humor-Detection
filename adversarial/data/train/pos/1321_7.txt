#1 waaaaay over priced. \n#2 after being sat we were ignored for over 15 minutes we left. No water, no waitress, nothing and it wasn't even busy. It was 1\/2 full at best. So a table of 9 just got up and left.\n\nBut  terrible service aside, no small bowl of guacamole is worth $11. It's just not. And their drinks are the same story. for what they were offering it was way too much. I can (and did) go around the corner for some delicious thai food and a beer for what it would have cost me to have just 1 of their \"premium\" (read mid-level) margaritas. \n\nAnd if you're thinking I'm just a cheap-skate you're woefully mistaken. Go hunt down the Laundry room. I was drinking there the night before and the cocktails were worth every penny.
