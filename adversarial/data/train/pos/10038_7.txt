In the heart of Chinatown lies a Tiki bar with a clam shell big enough to take a selfie in!\n\nValet is super handy. The parking lot can be a total hot mess in a rather extreme way. Utilize it, I warned you.  \n\nDole whip on tap...yes you can get cocktails with the DW madness floating inside of it. DW is vegan and that chemical mess goes perfect with the sin of a spirit.\n\nIs it your birthday? Congrats you get a free tiki drink and a free Dole Whip!\n\nShows...always a good time. Mermaids who breathe fire, fun bands, surf music. Wild promotions like the upcoming hour of free green PBR for St. Patty's day (8-9pm I believe). \n\nIn this place you will find most nights packed and they are getting better with staffing the place properly. Don't come here in a rush and prepare to pay strip like prices for fancy drinks (this is not Frankie's people!) \n\nYou will find a mix of locals and tourists here. \n\nRelax, kick back, in a private table or enjoy the gaming up at the bar. Open 24\/7 it has something to tickle everyone's fancy.
