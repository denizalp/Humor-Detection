Some places wow you with their style and exotic cuisine, others sneak up on you with a little more subtlety. Maggiano's was one of my favorite meals in Las Vegas, because they just made everything easy. First of all, being in a non-smoking restaurant was literally a breath of fresh air. We got to curl up in a cozy booth facing floor to ceiling windows so it was an entirely different vibe from most casino restaurants. \n\nIt is a chain, but it meant they offered a wide variety of reasonably priced options and our lunch entrees, Chicken Pesto Linguine and Chicken Francese ($11 - 13), were excellent. One of my favorite things to eat in Italy is a fresh arugula salad lightly tossed with oil, but it is hard to find in the U.S. I was thrilled when it came as a side to the Chicken Francese and it brought back so many wonderful memories. \n\nFrom our arrival through the end of service, the staff was professional, prompt and courteous. Portion size was hearty, especially the pasta dish, so we even skipped dinner that night. Not the most exciting choice in town, but sometimes you just want a little comfort food and air, sweet, sweet fresh air.
