Golly gee, I get to review another Sam's Club! I gotta tell ya, this Sam's club is not one of my favorites. The staff here are.....welllllll, let's just say I think they all eat from the same bowl of cheerios with expired milk. Smiles? Uhhhh.... Helpful? Uhhhh..... suffice to say, I don't come here for the staff interactions.\n\nI love this locations parking lot. Easy to navigate and plenty of spots to park. I cannot say that about all the local Sam's clubs. They have plenty of gas pumps at the gas station too....making it super easy when it is busy.\n\nThe layout of this location is nice and they keep it clean and tidy. Plenty of checkouts that are well staffed too. Their produce section can be a bit hit or miss with freshness however.\n\nOverall this location is mediocre. I come often but am never wowed.
