I've been a member of the Village for quite awhile and loved the place for all it's ammenities but for some reason I would dread going there. In retrospect, the drive was just a hassle, the distance, the traffic. For the gym itself the hoards of kids screaming jumping around was a lil tough . So when I saw the reviews of Gold's elite that is only 1\/2 a  mile  from my house I knew I had to check it out!\nFirst, it was a little tricky for me to find but if you come down 1st st and turn right onto Washington, the oneway stay in left lane the parking garage is there on your left. Be careful pulling in!! Watch the signs! \n\nThe gym is on the second floor and let me tell you!! Gorgeous view, wide open climate controlled gym to a cool temp. My salesperson Jessica is amazing she was fun, open and not a hard sell. The gym sells itself really! I got the full tour, signed up, made my first training appt, got my free travel passes for next week then I was out the door in 30 min! That was awesome I was on a schedule! another perk, the restaurant \"First Watch\" is on the corner and starbucks on the other !! I be ready for an egg-white omelet after a good workout !\nI'll be riding my bike since it's so close. They don't have bike racks yet but no problem, they  will accomodate my wheels! The price is reasonable !!!\nSo bye bye Village you were good to me but hands down Golds Elite has what works for me !!
