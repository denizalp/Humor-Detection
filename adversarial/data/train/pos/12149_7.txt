2.5-3 \n\nI really wanted to love this place! \n\nGood morning Veterans day, YAHOO day off for teachers! My boyfriend suggested we get breakfast to celebrate not having to wake up at 5am. He suggested some of our usual favorites (Kiss the Cook, Black Bear diner, etc...) but I have really been slacking on my yelping and wanted to try something new and delicious. I consulted my friends at YELP and was SO excited to find what I thought would be another hidden gem only a few miles from our place... \n\nWe got there around 10:45 and the place was PACKED! This made us very excited because usually a packed place = solid food, solid service. We had a tiny wait and had a great little booth spot. After about 5 minutes our server...for the sake of kindness, lets call her grouchy girl...flew over and literally threw menus at us. Not cool. She then came back for our drink order and seemed greatly put-out by our request for water with our coffees. Sorry for that extra 36 seconds we requested from you grouchy girl. \n\nThe menu looked great! I love the simple idea of creating your own omelet. I had an egg white omelet with chicken (had never done this before and loved it!), tomatoes, spinach, onion, avocado. The omelets come with all kinds of greasy starchy goodness which I turned down for a bowl of fruit. Grouchy girl clearly did not like this choice. My boyfriend went with the waffle breakfast with bacon and scrambled eggs. He enjoyed the waffle and bacon but the eggs really did look bizarre. \n\nLooking around the room I noticed a lot of biscuits and gravy...maybe this is where we went wrong but either way, I doubt we will return.
