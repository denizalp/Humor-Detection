My experience at Mesa Grill was nothing short of excellent!\n\nTo be quite honest, I did not even know who Bobby Flay was prior to visiting this restraunt. Now when people ask me what my favorite steakhouse is, I tell them it's Bobby Flay's steakhouse in Caesars Palace.\n\nMe and my friends were visiting Vegas for the weekend, and was looking for that ONE good meal we can all enjoy and look back upon, since it was first time in Vegas for few of us. Mesa Grill was more of an experience rather just a meal for us. \n\nThe steak (I ordered Filet Mignon) was one of the best I ever have had in my life. It was perfect. It made me forget about every other mediocre steakhouses I usually go when I am back in my hometown.. The Roasted Corn side was also amazing !! \n\nSome may be reluctant to give this place a try from just looking at the prices on the menu, but I completely thought that it was worth every dollar. \n\nThe waiter who was serving us was also 5\/5. He made sure our experience at Mesa Grill was top notch.\n\nThank you Mesa Grill and I will certainly be back in the future !!
