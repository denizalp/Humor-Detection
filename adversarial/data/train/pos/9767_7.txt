The best prices are in their clearance section in the back, otherwise--I didn't really notice much of a discount for the quality of shoes. \n\n*GASP* I know I sound super-cheap. But $70 for Jessica Simpson sandals? Methinks not. I'd say more like $40. And I hardly call that \"designer.\" Although--I will add that I find it quite ridiculous that both Jessica Simpson and Steve Madden shoes are priced as high as (if not more than) better designer shoes. While DSW does have an occasional BCBG, Calvin Klein pump, most are over-price nonsense brands I've never heard of... Maybe I'm looking at the wrong sections? The boots were hit or miss--if you're looking for designer brands you've heard of? There are a few, but most are still around $150, especially for leather. And I didn't see any that blew my mind. Otherwise it's mostly that super-cheap looking faux leather, like the ones you see in the windows of Charlotte Russe, but 5x more expensive. Mens prices and brands seemed more spot on. \n\nMy sister and I looked around for a bit and she really hit the jackpot with a unique Calvin Klein heel for around $40. I was quite jealous! But that was really the best deal we found. Other than that, I think they could lower their prices on everything by at least $15-20--based on what they carry.
