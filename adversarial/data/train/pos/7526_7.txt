This is a great place to come to wait ,when you are waiting for a flight to come in.\nYou do not have to drive around the Airport wasting gas and getting in anyones way.\nYou simply pull in here, wait for your cell phone call and relax.\nWhen your party arrives, they call you and they go to get their luggage.\nYou leave the lot and go to Passenger pick up.\nIt works like a charm.\nThere is one on each side of the Airport as well. So weather you are coming from the East or the West you can use one.\nPlus it is free. You do not have to pay as you would have to if you parked.
