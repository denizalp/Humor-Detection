MILK MARRIED ICE = SNOW\n\nThis is a cute simple little place. I am usually used to only one size shaved snow ice desserts but it is nice to see different sizes.\n\nThe guy was very nice & made our desserts very quickly. It was fun to watch our snow being shaved as he went to work peddling away & shaping away.\n\nThere is a little area along the wall to sit down by this place would definitely not be able to hold too many people...\n\nTASTY TARO $3.93 - got the small size... lychee jelly, taro snow, snowflake sauce. I added some mochi bits as well. The taro snow was AWESOME just the right amount of sweetness & it tasted like actual taro instead of the SUPER sweet artificial flavor! The lychee jelly gave it an extra kick of sweetness.\n\nCHOCO LOCO $3.93 - chocolate snow, Brownie bits, chocolate bits, & chocolate sauce. This is like chocolate galore!! But the hubby lobed it & freaken devoured it! It was also the small size but definitely 2 people would be more than content.
