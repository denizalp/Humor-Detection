My 8 year old daughter and I came here around 6pm on a Sat night for dinner. There were only 2 tables sat but it was a fairly nice crowd (6 tables...the place isn't that big) by the time we finished around 7:30pm. \n\nFOOD: We started with a cup of posole which was much better after I asked for a side of lime. I ordered the salmon w\/ mashed parsnips. It was good...the parsnips were a little too sweet for me as I typically like savory but it was tasty, nonetheless. My daughter loved the mushrooms and I did too! My daughter had the shrimp and grits which weren't your typical shrimp-n-grits like what you get on NOLA. It was poached shrimp which is fine but the dish lacked favor. I had to ask for salt, pepper and hot sauce to help it out. They serve Homeboy's hot sauce and the Verde went well with it. They should replace the green sauce that come drizzled on it with something more flavorful like that Verde sauce. The Malbec I had was delish! We skipped dessert. \n\nSERVICE: Our server (male) was great but there was a blonde female server (asked her for limes) who was indifferent...not nasty but not friendly either. \n\n\nSUMMARY: The food was good but needed some extra seasoning\/flavor. However, it's a nice, low key, quaint yet kinda trendy spot in the neighborhood with seemingly healthy and fresh food so I will be back. Only 3-stars because for a tab of $57 (before tip), I shouldn't have to add to the food to make it more flavorful.
