Much smaller serving sizes compared to other EggSmart locations.\n\nThe wait time here is brutal! It took at least half an hour for the food to arrive!\n\nThis place gets really busy, so I suggest just going to Honey B Hives for your breakfast, and skip this place when necessary.\n\nTheir food is overpriced for the amount and the service you get.\n\nReview 69 of 100
