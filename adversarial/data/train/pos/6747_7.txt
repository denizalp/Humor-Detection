Time: 10am. Place: Poppy's. Impulse purchase: Bagels, doz. Intent: I get to play Bagel Fairy all day with a dozen of the best bagels in Charlotte.\n\nI distributed my cache of carb thoughtfully, but thoroughly. And not before eating two in one sitting. Bagelbloat, yeesh.\n\nCoffee was just OK but I honestly don't think they care much about anything except the bagatorial arts up in Poppy's and in that distinguished category, they get an A+. Sad to me that Bore's Head is what they have for slices and cheeses since that stuff is just nasty, but hey.\n\nNo more Bruegger's for me. No more terrorizing Owen. I get Poppy bagels, I eat Poppy bagels, I love Poppy bagels.\n\nnote - these suckers are such globs of gluten that they don't age very well - freeze 'em, if you must, instead of sitting 'em in the breadbox.
