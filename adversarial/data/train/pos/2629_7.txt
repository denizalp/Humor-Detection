It says 4C Broast Chicken but they have much more going on than just Fried Chicken: breakfast sandwiches served all day, baked goods, coffee and blended drinks.\n\nPretty busy place with lots of regulars hanging out. The place is clean with many tables and big windows to watch the world go by.\n\nIt doesn't look like the staff enjoy working there by the lack of warmth and smiles (Sunday early afternoon crew). \n\nOrdered the following: 4 piece chicken combo with spicy fries (pretty mild) and a small pop, a side of onion rings and an iced cappuccino (it was a blended drink).\n\nCooked to order so they were piping hot and crunchy. The breast was on the dry side but the wing, thigh and leg were juicy. Fries were dusted and fried so they were tasty and crunchy but not spicy at all. Onion rings were crunchy but meh. Iced cappuccino was tiny and tasted terrible. \n\nOverall everything was too oily and the only reason we'd return is if hubby has a greasy fried chicken craving.
