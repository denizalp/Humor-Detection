Well we had a party of 6 so we waited about 20 mins for a table.  We had just came from hiking so we got really thirsty from waiting and asked for water.  They said we were about to be seated soon so we waited. \n\nwe already knew what we wanted having waited so long so we quickly ordered.  We got our water once our food came.  We also got a few sushi rolls before appetizer and two people who ordered bento boxes had to wait longer. So we all waited and started digging in.\n\nI have never had sushi roll that fall apart.  The volcano roll also was lack of fish and I've never seen that.  We had to ask to return one roll because it was just falling apart and we couldn't eat it.  \n\nThe salmon roll and Vegas roll were really good.  Just the volcano was falling apart.  The Gyoza was also delicious. We tried the pork and vegetable.  So this can be hit or miss but I know I don't recommend it if you looking for some sushi in Arizona!!!
