Okay. So Eagle is a gay bar.  I did not know this when I went the other night.  And while I enjoy gay bars like BS and Amsterdam, I am not sure I'd go again to this one. I went just looking for a new bar to have a few drinks at, and what I found was so much more.  Cheap drinks were flowing freely ($2 margs!) but I also found hairy men in bondage wear. \n\nSeriously.  They were just prancing around wearing leather straps strategically placed to hide their junk. I think it was around the time of my third margarita that I decided, if it doesn't bother them, it doesn't bother me.  Everyone was nice enough and they were all just doing their own thing, so I drank and chatted and ended up having a good time. The drinks were good and strong and the staff was very friendly. \n\nIf you're into bondage (I'm sure not every night has this theme) or are just looking for a new neighborhood bar to hang out at, give it a try! Just don't forget to bring your finest leather thong and whip.
