This movie theater is horrible!  Oh my god and its right in the middle of the Las Vegas Strip where everything is supposed to be nice???  This place is ghetto as hell!  The seats are so old and used that they have all had their padding dissolved over the years and all you are sitting on is metal wiring!!!  After about 30 minutes of sitting on it it becomes painful and cuts off your circulation!  I almost couldn't even sit through the whole movie!!!  And it was a movie that I had been looking foreward to coming out for a whole year and waiting to see on opening day and then I went to see it and this seat ruined the freaking movie!!!  I could hardly pay attention to the movie because after halfway through I was in pain and my circulation was cut off...and I'm not even an old man or anything!!!  Its ridiculous!  \n\nAnd then when I got out of the movie and went to the bathroom it was absolutely disguisting...like something you would expect from a really nasty dive bar...It was despicable.  \n\nAnd when I complained to the manager about the seats all she did was laugh at me and say \"yea we are known for our old school seats\" like its cute or something.  Didn't even offer me a couple of free movie passes to get me back or anything even though I told her I wouldn't want to come there again, and that I am a local.  Guess what its not cute that the seats have metal wiring poking up into your ass.  And they are ALL like that.  I changed seats several times.  They are all like that.  \n\nSave yourself the money and go to a different theater this one is ridiculous.  And I mean come on movie tickets arent cheap either.  You'll be pissed when you pay to see a movie you are excited about and cant hardly concentrate due to the discomfort.
