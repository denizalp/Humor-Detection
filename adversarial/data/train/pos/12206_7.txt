I wake up, head pounding, wondering where the hell I am. I glance to my left and see Liz passed out mouth open next to me. Aha Vegas. This means buffet.\n\nNow, let me tell you, 9 girls getting ready is not a fun time when you ony have two rooms. I was hungover, in dire need of :\nA)My morning coffee\nB) A bottomless supply of mamosas\nC) Mass amounts of food\nD) All of the above.\n\nSo, after two hours of me pacing and complaining of the lack of speed from some hungover people we make our way to the Mirage. Buffet cost: $25. Shit. I told Kelly  would pay for her. This better be good for fifty bucks.\n\nIt was. There was everything! The waitress promptly brought us 9 mimosas and waters. Bottomless mimosas were included. I love it. I ate: A panini, deep dish pizza, gelato, sushi, chinese noodles, mashed potatoes, crab legs, shrimp, chilaquilas, breakfast burrito, and washed it down with 20 mimosas. Yes 20. The lady was awesome. I would take a sip after she finished pouring and she would come back and fill the little that I had drank. Then Liz didn't want hers and I aqcuired two glasses. This turned into a competition between Kelly and I, who could drink the most before she left the table. because this lady would always refill.\n\nI love you lady. I asked you to come home with me but you wouldn't. But you ensured me to definitely come back.
