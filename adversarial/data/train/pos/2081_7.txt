PJ the angry tour guide. \n\nWhere do I begin? The Trolley was late arriving, so the rep suggested that we use the restrooms in the meantime. Apparently, within moments of leaving for the long walk to the restroom area PJ arrived. After the long wait to use the restrooms, several members of our party returned to the pick-up area to face a VERY angry PJ !!!\n\nPJ used her microphone to complain about our \"tardiness\", state multiple times that the tour must start on time, etc. Needless to say, her behavior was an unpleasant start to the tour for our 12-person party. \n\nThen, PJ thought it was a great idea to grouse about the traffic intermittently throughout the rest of the tour. USING THE MICROPHONE!!! In fact, a driver of an SUV that she complained about using the microphone heard her and hurled insults back at her!\n\nThe last insult of the tour came at the end when PJ had the audacity to move her tip jar prominently near the aisle. We are big tippers when the service is good. The service was NOT good. \n\nWhen we passed the empty tip jar, PJ the angry tour guide loudly said, \"Thank You!\"\n\nHow do you like that?
