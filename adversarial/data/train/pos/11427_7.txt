I came here with a pretty big party and we were sat upstairs.  Our table was loud, laughing, and probably distracted a lot of the other patrons if they would have   been upstairs with us...  luckily we were fortunate to be the only ones up there and we could tell as many inappropriate jokea as we wanted---just kidding we only told 2 maybe 10 of those. Our servers were all really attentive and handled our table of 25 ppl with tons of confidence and ease.  They did not look stressed out at all with our many demands for food, drinks, water, napkins, plates, and most importantly the birthday shots!\n\nAll of the food was delicious and made fresh to enjoy. I ordered the duck sliders and chicken pot pie and it was made to perfection. Others had the lamb, steak, burgers, poutine, and all of the food was just so damn good!!!  Our entire table was satisfied with everything Wilcox gave us.\n\nWe even enjoyed the awesome music they had playing through the speakers as well which added to the trendy, cool, and hip vibe the Wilcox gives out.\n\nThere is plenty of parking and the lounge area looks classy and chill but not too uptight.  I highly recommend this place if you are looking for a decent priced resto-lounge with great food!  PLUS... $5 drinks and beer between 3pm - 7pm you cannot go wrong!\n\nIn the words of the Terminator..... \"I'll be back!\"
