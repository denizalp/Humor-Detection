I don't usually eat at vegetarian restaurants... I have to kill an animal for dinner every night. The man wanted to have vegetarian food for a change, and I agreed (I am a great bf, thank you very much!)\n\nHigh end vegetarian fare. It is a chain of vegetarian restaurants around Canada. The vegetarian buffet has plenty of options. You can even buy wine in small bottles. Perfect for that lunch when you crave a drink but you cannot get drunk because you have to go back to work.\n\nThere are different cuisines in the vegetarian buffet. Asian, Indian, some African, and North American fare. The food was very good... you can tell they use quality ingredients by the way food tastes around here. Wine selection is minimal but, good. \n\nA word of caution: it is expensive. The buffet is by the pound. It cost us more than $50 for the two of us, and we don't eat heavy during lunch.
