My family member was scheduled recently for a teeth extraction appointment.  We arrived on time, the front desk attendant did not know how to use the Dental Care card, for dentist services, even though the lobby was full of brochures and signage that they take that type of payment.  It took 50 minutes for her to figure out how to run the transaction, no one helped her and the procedure did not start until she completed it.  It gave us the feeling that they did not trust their patients to pay them, which was not the case, we were at their mercy to proceed.  It is our understanding the office manager (spouse) allows the staff to do only certain tasks...all the while we wait nearly an hour for them to check us in??  Totally unprofessional and lacks ability and efficeincy for their patrons.  There were no other patients there, we were the only ones.  The other review I have is of the recovery room, the appearance was that of a storage room with misc. items sitting allover.  This is an uncomfortable setting to try to use as a recovery space.  We were not given the necessary quantity of supplies for her to use for her recovery and were left to find more for ourselves.\n\n*** For the overall experience, I would NOT recommend this unprofessional office.
