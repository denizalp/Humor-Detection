Anyone who knows me well, knows I am a huge advocate of things with history.\nThis appreciation for vintage goods has been a thing of mine since I was a nerdy kid and would scope out all kinds of thrift stores and mothball-y garage sales. Because of my scavenging prowess, I know where to find a lot of the goods at Pretty Little Things elsewhere, and how much these various types of items would go for at other antique shops and sales. Therefore, in my opinion, the goods at Pretty Little Things are priced a little steeply. \n\nAlso, the whole entire set up looks like a set from Portlandia. While the aesthetic does appeal to my senses, it's just a little contrived for my taste. Also, not sure who the previous reviewer was greeted by, but the woman who greeted my friend and I was totally rude. She offered a grumpy \"hi\" as though we had intruded while we were already browsing, and didn't even crack a smile. She greeted many customers in this awkward fashion and it made me really uncomfortable. I don't think I plan to visit again.
