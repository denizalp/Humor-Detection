I have to say the theme of this place is very cute. It's modern, yet it has a country\/homey feel to it. My coworker offered to take me here for dinner one night after work for my birthday. We arrived around 7:30pm on a Monday eve, they were not busy and we were seated right away. We were given bread to start that came with the most delicious salted honey butter. I could have eaten the butter with a spoon. Travis, our server, suggested to me the Biloxi buttermilk chicken sandwich. It comes with two fried chicken patties, coleslaw and a delicious honey mustard sauce. It also came with a caesar salad on the side. The sandwich was bomb. I put the housemade butter pickles on it, and I dont even like butter pickles, yet this little addition really made the sandwich come together. The salad that accompanied my sandwich was a little dry, but nothing a little extra dressing couldn't fix. My meal was washed down with a tangy, yet refreshing cup of pomegranate iced tea. \n\nEven though I was pretty full after dinner, I couldn't leave without dessert, after all it was my birthday. I decided on the bourbon bread pudding and it was really good. I would have preferred a little more sauce, but it was still tasty nonetheless.
