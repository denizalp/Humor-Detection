I frequently go to this Shoppers Drug Mart for all my prescriptions and I have had no problems with them at all.\n\nI usually dont shop here for anything else so I cannot comment on the sales side of things, but for the pharmacy area, definitely would recommend to anyone that is looking to fill up their prescription.\n\nThey can fill your prescription on the phone and you can just pick it up when you can so you dont have to wait too long in the store. And even if you do come to fill your prescription and wait, usually the wait is only about 10-20 minutes. Mind you that's most pharmacies in Calgary.\n\nWhen I have questions with the pharmacy team, they are always extremely helpful. They are very attentive and they consider all of your concerns before giving you advice on medication. \n\nUpdate: I have recently moved farther down SE to Legacy and I still frequent this location as they have me on file and the service is still as great as ever.
