I LOVE BASIL BOX is an understatement.\n\nTried the Five Spice Steak with mix of classic peanut & sweet chilli sauce; and it tasted fantastic. And I probably drink their Thai Iced Tea - 3x a week or basically EVERY SINGLE TIME I go to Square one.\n\nStaffs are really accommodating, friendly, and so full of life. So much positivism. I love it!!! Food is flavourful! A box with their signature drink costs $14 (with tax) & its reasonable. \n\n\nI just wish there will be stamp cards for\ndrinks or food itself. (Like when you buy 5,\nYou get the 6th for free) --just to give back to their loyal customers (like me lol) \n\nBut then, regardless, with promos or without.. I still love Basil Box!!
