I like crepes and dessert and this would probably be the best place I've been too. Been here 2 times and both times the crepes were really good as well as crepes and dessert for the other tables looked really well done as well. \n\nThe gelato in a sugar cone was super delicious as well. Many different options.\n\nInterior was very country style homey with bright light and good seating. The music was a bit louder than I would have personally liked but it was too bad. Staff was super friendly and was dressed for the cafe. Very good experience overall.
