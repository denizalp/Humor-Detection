So as it turns out, I am out of shape. Like REALLY out of shape.\n\nThe boyf (coined it, don't try to steal it) and I parked at the bottom, gave each other a really empathetic look and climbed up our first flight of stairs. After the 6th step, I decided I needed to get back into the gym ASAP. \n\nOur goal was to reach the platform which boasts the city views, so we figured the hike would be worth it. Bikers zoomed past us, dedicated joggers ran by us, families with kids even trekked it up. I thought I saw a 5 year old pointing and laughing at me. Called me a lazyass under her breath. Somewhere, we took the wrong turn and ended up hiking up to a beautiful lake and open picnic space. We were so tired that we ended our journey there and even considered becoming homeless just so we don't have to walk back down (joking). But I have to say as exhausting as it was climbing up a damn mountain, the lake view made it worthwhile.
