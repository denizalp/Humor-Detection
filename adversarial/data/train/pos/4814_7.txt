What a cool little park this is. It has a little bit of everything. A grassy area, volley ball court, basket ball courts, hiking, etc. I came here for the hiking.\n\nI guess it is more of a place to walk than really hike. There is an upper\/outer trail that is paved and convenient. Then there is a lower unpaved\/natural turf trail. This lower one goes closer to the lakes edge and provides great viewing of the many birds just chilling here. I took the lower trail to give more of the hiking feel. Here I saw a good variety of birds. Maybe four different duck species, Canadian geese, and sea gulls. There were some non-water fowl here too. Starlings, sparrows and the rest of the usual city birds. The park may be surrouned by urban development but with the lake, the marsh and all the animals, it feels like wilderness. Even where the urban world makes its presence know, there is nature. Like the little urban desert glacier of frozen runoff water coming into the lake.\n\nCornerstone Park is well maintained and clean. The people visiting the park and hiking, much like myself, were so friendly. Nearly everybody I passed by bid me good morning. There were people walking, people jogging and people taking their dogs for a stroll. Regardless of their recreational status, they were all polite and courteous. It is refreshing to see in this spralling metropolis with little sense of community.
