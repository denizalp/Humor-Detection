Wow, excruciatingly awful.  Over-dramatized awful renditions of Christmas songs.  Reminded me of the worst hair bands of the 80s.  Too loud, and way too corny.  We left after the first half, couldn't stand another minute.  Hard to believe so many people like them.  Then again, people like crappy music.  Never again.
