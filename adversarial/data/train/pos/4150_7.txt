So, I heard great things about 424 Walnut, which is why we decided to go there for my birthday dinner this year. It was not so great.\n\nWe got the halloumi and vegetables, they were good, although a little burnt.\n\nI got the scallops which came with potatoes, salad, and broccoli slaw (cooked)\n\nThe first scallop was fine, it tasted good, good texture, the second made me gag. Something was wrong with them. I didn't eat any more than the one and 1\/4. My stomach was upset for the rest of the night, and I just opened the togo container and it smells like something died in there.... No bueno\n\nThe broccoli slaw was literally the kind of broccoli slaw they sell at giant eagle, cooked, and completely a mushy mess. GROSS\n\nThe potatoes were so salty I thought I would choke on them.\n\nThe salad was blah. I wish the waiter would have told us that we could choose from the other salads, but he only told that to the table behind us after we had ordered.\n\nThe key lime pie was delish, but not good enough to make up for the terrible other food. \n\nOh and on another note. I was served my dinner and had to ask for a fork 3 times before someone actually remembered to bring me one.
