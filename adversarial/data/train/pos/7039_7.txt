Sadly, this is as generous as I can be.  \nI would have messaged the business but I do not see the opportunity to message the business privately, which I prefer to posting a 2 star review. I understand any restaurant or business can have a bumpy day or night! \n\nI like this concept and enjoy Lazy Dog... But in the future, I will choose not to wait indefinitely for a table when everyone is hungry and we have brought our dogs:(  \n\nI called in advance to make a reservation and was told that they take reservations 24 hours in advance, for parties of 7 or more. The person on the phone told me they were always busy and there is always a wait.  I did not love the response, but our friends really wanted to bring their dogs so we happily went.\n\nOur group was told it was about a 20 minute wait... We sat and waited patiently on the patio with our party of 4 people and 3 doggies.  No offer of water or a beverage while we waited, for humans or doggies\n\nAt 45 minutes we were told we were 2nd on the list.  At one hour we were still number 2 on the list. We were hungry and wanting to know how much longer it would likely be.  We were told some parties had been at the tables on the patio for Over 4 Hours and they had No Idea when we would get a table:( \n\nWe discussed the situation and no one wanted to wait on the stone benches any longer... \n\nWe left and walked next door to another restaurant's patio, sat down immediately and enjoyed a Fabulous meal on the neighbor restaurant's patio.  They welcomed us and our dogs.  See Spot Run next door
