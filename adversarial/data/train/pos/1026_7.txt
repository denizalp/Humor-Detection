This is a spot we have been to about 8 times. The secret to this place is know what to expect, when to go and what to order. There are only a few things on the menu you can order and not be totally pissed. If you plan your visit just right it can be ok. If you do not you will leave upset and have a 0 star experience.\n\nFood:\n\nDo order the pretzel and beer. Do order the Cesar salad. Do order the breakfast burrito. Do order the bread pudding. Do order drinks.\n\nDo not order just about anything else. Most of the menu is void of flavor or correct preparation. Do not be tricked into item descriptions like Mac and cheese, pizza, burger etc.. It's a trap.\n\nService: \n\nDo not come here if you like quality service and attentive servers. The servers are pretty bad. Most of the time I have to flag down our server to get refills on drinks. They usually do not give a shit about you or your needs.\n\nAtmosphere: \n\nGreat building, Bar and patio. This is the real disappointment because with the right food and service this place could be very good. But even with a great layout you will be disappointed as the laid back pet friendly patio gets over run by kids who's parents use it as a Chuck E Cheese and let their kids run around screaming and yelling while they zone them out. It seems like this place has changed from an adult hang out to a kids playground on the weekend and is the last place you want to chill out with friends for a relaxing meal. This past visit we had a bean bag thrown onto our table and a glass broken next to us by a wonderful group of children who had been running around acting like wildlings all evening. If you are one of those inconsiderate parents who likes to turn your kids loose to annoy the shit out of others while you pretend not to know what they are doing so you can take a break from your unruly children and have a good time with like minded parents you will love it!
