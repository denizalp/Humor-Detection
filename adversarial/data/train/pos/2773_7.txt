A quick & convenient option when you've got meetings in the sands convention center at the CRACK OF DAWN!! Vegas can be so cruel \n\n---ice blended mocha: a good breakfast option to go with my banana.. It's pretty much the same price as starbucks.. I wasn't expecting the chocolate drizzle though\n\nNOTE: they also offer pastries, yogurt, etc if you need more than a drink to hold you over
