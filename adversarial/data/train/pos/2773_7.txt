The hottest spot north of the Lakeshore!\n\nBelow the newly opened Copacabana on Adelaide Street is Shibui Robata Bar, a fabulous little Japanese restaurant that deserves six stars for having such a fabulous overall combination of amazing food and incredible service.\n\n At our server's recommendation, we began with a round of the Sake and cucumber cocktail that was refreshing, light and not too sweet.\n\nThe ceviche arrived at the table in soft slices of white fish marinated in citrus with green apple and kiwi. If was cleansing, simple and absolutely perfect.\n\nEdamame was coated in a spicy, nutty and ever so slightly sweet chile sauce that was delicious  enough for us to order another round.\n\nThe soba noodle salad is not to be missed! A wonderful concoction of tangled, crispy and colourful root vegetables, toothy soba noodle and a delicious vinaigrette that is tossed for you at the table. It's truly one of the most incredible harmonies of light texture and flavour that I've had in ages. This dish is absolutely a must have for any foodie in the city. I repeat: YOU MUST ORDER THIS DISH!!\n\nWe had the avocado and salmon roll which was really fresh and served with a generous portion of wasabi and ginger.\n\nThe hot pot remained the most underwhelming dish, despite being tasty. I'm generally not a fan of cooked through salmon, so that may have been what veered me off course, but over all was a decent albiet not a stand out dish, ripe with mushroom, it was perhaps not my style, but still quite good.\n\nThe chef sent out a complimentary roll consisting of spicy kewpie shrimp on top of rice with a filling of the most finely julienned crisp cucumber and asparagus. each layer of finely cut vegetables crunched in your mouth like tiny firecrackers. \n\nThe black cod is like grilled umami candy-- but walks just the perfect ratio of savoury to sweet.  Might just be the best piece of fish I've had-- garnished with daikon rosettes and ordered with a side of char grilled asparagus, this was a memorable piece of fish that was cooked to absolute perfection.\n\nI think that Shibui Robata bar far surpasses the Cobacabana upstairs. Situated just West of University Avenue, it's a great spot for a pre-club dinner or a perfect choice for a corporate lunch.\n\nMy only criticism-- and it is very slight-- is that Shibui needs to separate itself, identity wise and spatially from the Copacabana. It's confusing why they are even connected other than for the obvious fiscal reasons, but this place might even benefit from moving further from Coapcabana and making a name for itself. \n\nIt's more than good enough to stand alone.\n\nYou need to go here. \n\nYo need to eat here.\n\nThat is all.
