Came here once before a few years ago and now remember why I haven't been back since.  Thank god for Yelp I can now check to see why I quit going here when I am curious years down the road. To start, Kelsey our waitress ... Was sitting with her neighbors while having us wait 15 minutes to order food after our appetizer was finished but the bartender let us know that It's okay because she's the owners future daughter in-law... Food was burnt and pure bland. My recommendation, never come here. You would think being related to the owner you'd have some sort of pride in your job, clearly she doesn't, which reflects on the other employees that made up excuses for the terrible service
