Thank you Michael Symon for making my inner fat kid extremely satisfied! I've been to Lolita a few times now, and I am finally ready to write a well-deserved review for one of my favorite restaurants :) \n\nFirst things first, make sure you make a reservation before coming here! Even on a weekday night it can get pretty busy because everyone and their moms know how amazing this place is.\n\nFor starters, I recommend getting the pig ears\/tails, bone marrow, and mussels. The pig tails and ears are super crispy! The pig tails are slightly fatty, but it's not overpowering and is balanced well by the crispy skin and tangy flavor! The bone marrow is very savory and slightly fatty as well, but again, not too much! Mussels are always my go-to appetizers, and Lolita is no exception! I love the lightness of the sauce, and the crunchy breads are perfect for your dipping pleasures :) \n\nFor the entree, I've tried the following: \n- Pork sausage pizza: crispy crust with deliciously tender pork? Can't ask for anything more! \n- Grilled Quail: you get 2 quails in this dish! The meat is suuuuuuper, like ridiculously, tender! The flavoring is great as well, a bit sweet and very savory! \n- Pork chop milanese: Perfectly crispy outer shell with tender and flavorful pork! The sauce has a hint of sweetness in it. I love it! \n\nI always order the brussel sprouts as a side! It is perfectly salted and savory. Some may think it's kinda oily, but my taste buds like it just fine :) I've recently tried their new cauliflower side, which is my NEW favorite! It's similar to mac n cheese but without the mac and with tons of cauliflower! Best part about it is the crunchy top layer, which goes so well with the soft and creamy core! \n\nI'm looking forward to many more trips to this restaurant!
