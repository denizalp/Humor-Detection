This is a pretty popping pizza joint. Whether you like regular hand tossed, chicago deep dish, fries, chicken strips, and other delectable greasy morsels. They have tvs all around the restaurant which you can view from the booths or bar counter. They also have outside seating for anyone who'd like to do people watching instead. Their deep dish Chicago pizza is worth a purchase and so is their deep fried pickles. So this is how it works, order food at window to the right when you enter, they give you a number, you find a seat and their team members in cool fedoras bring your food and get you anything there after. If you'd like a low maintenance place to watch sports, have some tasty pizza, this neighborhood family friendly establishment should be your final destination.
