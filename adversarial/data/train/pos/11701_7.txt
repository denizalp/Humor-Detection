Food is always pretty good.  A tad over-priced.  11 dollars for French fries and gravy is a bit much.  Beer is solid.  Andy is a great brewer.  Cool looking place.  Since its on 25th you get the inherent douchy crowd a lot.  Not really the beer enthusiast, but more the beer-cocktail type crowd.  CLE and \"Ohio\" shirts everywhere.  Ok, we get it.  Cleveland has turned a corner and your the biggest cheerleader.  Servers are lackluster.  All these new, hip places have people with zero personality but do look the part.  Go to a diner or an old man bar and see someone that been doing it for years.  THATS service.  Not just to afford a night out drinking and an 8-ball, but to survive and pay the bills.
