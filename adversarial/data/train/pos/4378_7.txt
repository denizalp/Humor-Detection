3.5 stars. Solid acts, good choreography, fun show. The ladies are all attractive, great performers, and hold your interest throughout the show. \n\nBUT. here's the thing - when a show clearly puts itself in a particular genre and targets that type of attention and appeal, it is going to be judged on more than talent. And here are the missing 1.5 stars. The ladies are all in great shape with nice figures, but all but 1 or 2 appear to be in their 40s or more (the prettiest was easily the French maid girl, and she also has the best assets ;) ). Don't get me wrong, women can be sexy (or sexxy) at any age. But watching a lady approaching middle age jiggling her boobs on stage as a Vegas showgirl makes for less than 5 stars. It's almost like watching your mom's friends strip.\n\nFinally, as the producer and choreographer, Jennifer Romas is featured prominently in the show. She is clearly a talented dancer and put together a great show. But, again, this is a specific type of show that rides on a specific type of appeal - and Jennifer is by far the least attractive of the ladies. \n\nThis could easily be a 5 star show - keep everything the same, but recruit 3 or 4 new up and coming girls who are\/look to be in their 20s\/early 30s. Done.
