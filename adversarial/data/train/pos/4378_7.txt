Ghetto.  If ya have to stop at that intersection going to 490 or Steelyard you will see what I mean.  Doors wide open, no screen door (bugs and steel mill dust just whafting in)..  Kids running around unsupervised.  A lot of the stolen cars in Tremont wind up here magically (mine did)..These are suposed to be mostly section 8 but if ya look at the cars parked there I think someone may be scamming the system?  nahhhh..
