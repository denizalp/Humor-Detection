Absolutely love this place, it's fun for all ages. Anything from family fun, to dates, to girls night out or bachelor parties to corporate events!  A really fun way to spend a couple hours. \n\nIf you haven't tried them yet, must order the donut balls that come with filling injection shots.  And if you have stronger willpower than  me and pass on the donuts, don't worry the menu is filled with so many other delicious options. \n\nThe drinks here are also good, and you can't beat the beautiful desert sunset views. Great place.
