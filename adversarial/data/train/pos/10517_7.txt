Yardbird was featured on the Food Network, so you know it's got some serious street cred. Reservations are accepted, so I highly suggest making one to ensure you actually get to dine there! \n\nWe shared the Fried Green Tomato BLT, which was probably my single favorite dish of the night. Big fried green tomato topped with thick pork belly, pimento cheese, tomato jam and greens. We also split the fried chicken with a side of macaroni and cheese. The fried chicken was decadent, with the most incredibly juicy meat ever. I liked the macaroni and cheese, but I didn't love it. It was a little too thick and didn't taste of the five cheeses they boasted about. \n\nService was a-okay. He was a little infrequent with checking in on us, but the GM came around, which I appreciated it. Overall, I would definitely be back!
