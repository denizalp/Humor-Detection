The pastrami sandwich here is legit for Vegas. The size it good and the pastrami has a ton of flavor. The meat is thicker cut but extremely tender. The only strange thing about this sandwich is they use American cheese instead of swiss or provolone. The sandwich tastes good enough that I can overlook it but I would prefer a white cheese on it. It does come with mustard and pickles and the bread is freaking good. For about $10 make it a combo with fries an a drink. You can eat inside or they have a drive thru. They also have burgers and breakfast but just stick with the pastrami.
