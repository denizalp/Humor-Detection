The Panda Express of Filipino fast food. I been coming here since high school. they have more selections than the comparable Filipino restaurants around. I love coming here for breakfast because everything is fresh! I just wish they renovate the place or maintain it. Food is good but I'm just skeptic about what goes on in the back and overall cleanliness of the place. I'm from the Philippines tho so I don't mind much but for American standards it's something to think about.
