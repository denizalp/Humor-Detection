We went to this place the other day from Yelp reviews. The first thing you notice is the bright inviting colors and decor. The staff is friendly and personable. Inside and outside dining, with plenty of room between tables and structure. So here we go...\n\nCons (in no particular order): \n\nThe bathroom men's sink is not mounted on center, which appears to cause water flow over the back side. Not a huge deal, but for a clean freak it leads one to believe there will be mildew on the bottom of it eventually.\n\nAgain, a bathroom thing; the refuse bin has no handle, so you must lift the lid with your hand or foot. It does appear to be made of bamboo, which is a nice environmental touch.\n\nPrice is a bit much for a local bistro. That's a personal preference point, but still.\n\nI ordered the ahi tuna special, but was charged for the lamb chops. The price may have very well been the same, but I didn't notice it until after we left, so its a matter of distress to be sure.\n\nPros (again, as they spring to mind):\n\nThe staff is exceedingly friendly and personable. They make you feel attended to and welcome. One of the owners (Bryce) walked around to each table and actually talked to each guest (that I saw). \nNot the usual manager walk by you see, but a sincere \"how are you, where are you from, what do you think\" conversation.\n\nThe food was phenomenal. Curry soup with just the right amount of zing. Seared ahi that was perfect for a fork on top of yellow and green beans that were done perfectly, with a nice crunch to them and not drowned in butter or oil. Excellent mashed potatoes. Generous portions of pasta and shrimp. Red Cake that was creamy yet not too overbearing. Strike that. If I weren't a guy I would call it luscious. If I were a violent man I'd have left that place, driven to the airport, hopped on a plane to Betty Crocker's house and slapped her across the face. It was that good.\n\nTwo words: Ginger. Beer.\n\n\nOrdering an $8 shot of premium liquor gets you an $8 shot of premium liquor. Enough to fill a glass nicely.\n\nDefinitely recommend DW Bistro for a nice quiet dinner after work, but also have not tried to brunch, so I can't pigeon hole it just to night dinning. There's absolutely room for improvement to turn it into a local upper scale place to hang out, but for a little restaurant in a strip mall they are off to a superlative start. I mean, when two of the only cons for a place are in the bathroom, you know it has to be on the right track.  Please give it a try and let me know what you think.
