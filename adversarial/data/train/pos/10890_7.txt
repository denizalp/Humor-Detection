Needless to say this place is amazing. If you're looking for a great indoor range that isn't always swamped with out of town people, come to Green Valley Range. But that also doesn't mean that if you're from out of town you aren't welcome here! Come on by. \n\nI frequent GVR at least once a week; so much so that I became a member. Perks are awesome as a member. Check it out next time your there.\n\nWhat sets GVR range above the rest is the quality and nicety of the facilities. Everything here is kept up very nicely. Probably one of the best indoor shooting experiences you will have.\n\nWould I come back here? Well, I'm a member so definitely.\n\nWould I recommend this place to others? I do, at least once a week when guns become a topic of conversation.
