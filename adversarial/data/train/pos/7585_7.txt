Crack! The Furikake chicken should be illegal! This thing soo damn addictive! It's flavorful, crispy, juicy, sweet, and sticky - this should be a song :) I've also tried the Kalua Pork and Kalbi Ribs. All are really good. The winner for me however, is the Furikake Chicken. Who created this wonderful thing????\nThe double meat plate is enormous, it lasts me about 3 meals. Oh, the coffee mud pie is really good too. The only downer is that this place is soooo far from me. Maybe it's not such a bad thing since I'm trying to be skinny :)\nI ordered to go and dined in, both experiences were great. It looks like this spot is pretty busy, no matter what time. No surprise.
