simonster's version of hell on earth (part 3)...\n\nmemorial day weekend, 2008.\n\ni was really expecting to love le reve.  it's choreographed by the same cirque du soleil choreographer that did \"o,\" which is my fave cirque show of all time.  similar to \"o,\" le reve is a water show, which has even more appeal for me.  \n\ni can't help but marvel at the engineering necessary to raise and lower those underwater platforms.  one minute a bunch of hot dancers are flitting around in leotards on a metal platform, and the next, the hot dancers are flying through the air and plunging into water where the platform just was!  amazing.  i keep thinking to myself, \"wow, if anybody's timing is off, *SPLAT*!\"\n\ni'd planned the evening, so i was really looking forward to showing my gal at the time and my friends a good time with a magical vegas trio of dinner, a show, and some dancing.  to start the evening, i made reservations at daniel baloud's brasserie, which was fantastic.  amazing service, refined, flavorful food, and even a quaint little light show on the waterfall outside.  \n\nafter a leisurely dinner, we strolled across the casino floor to le reve theater, where our VIP passes got us a special waitress and plush couples seating around a little table already laid with chocolate covered strawberries and champagne.  each VIP seating area also included a flat-panel monitor which gave some really interesting behind-the-scenes and underwater live footage.  \n\nservice at the show was excellent as well, and our glasses refilled as if by magic.  the show itself was actually not as good as \"o,\" but still entertaining.  and those flat-panel monitors might actually detract, since seeing all the behind-the-scenes and underwater footage actually took away some of the show's mystique.\n\nregardless, we were off to a great start, and we were really enjoying ourselves.  but when we arrived at blush, the evening turned sour very quickly.\n\nincluded in the VIP tickets is SUPPOSED to be comped entry ($30 value) and no-wait access to the wynn's blush nightclub.  that's what they told me when i booked the tickets to justify the added expense, that's what they confirmed at the ticket counter when i picked up the tickets that night, and that's what the back of the freakin' pass even says!  no conditions, no exceptions, no question.\n\ninstead, we had to wait 20+ minutes in front of blush only to find out from a snooty manager that our VIP passes were worthless over the memorial day weekend and that cover would be $50.  trying to be rational, i offered him the extra $20 per person on top of the $30 credit our VIP passes should have comped us, which he flatly refused.\n\nmy gal at the time, always the voice of reason, saw the futility of trying to reason with that idiot, so we went to find a hotel concierge with hopefully more sense than the club manager.  unfortunately, the front desk night manager used that familiar excuse made so popular by unempowered customer service morons the world over:  \"there's nothing i can do.\"\n\nridiculous.  \n\nthe following monday when i got home, i wrote a note outlining our disappointing experience to wynn's customer service email address.  in it i pointed out that communication between blush and le reve management needed to be improved to prevent issues like this, and that any establishment that prides itself on offering world-class service should ALWAYS have an escalation path for resolving disputes with a manager present or on call who can make decisions on behalf of the establishment as a whole.\n\nit's been a week, and i still haven't gotten a response.\n\nbased on this experience, i'm never going back to the wynn again.
