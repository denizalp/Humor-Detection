We come here once every year. But every year I feel older and older coming back. Full of kids...super loud... so hot...pungent smells...long lineups.\n\nI usually order a Jap fried tofu dish but didn't see it. So after all the walking around for nothing, all I got was chatime. Course, we were also very full from eating dinner so we no longer had the appetite for something big. Tried a bit of the oreo shaved ice japanese dessert (Kakigori). That was nice but melted rather quickly due to the hot temperature. \n\nI couldn't stand the performers. Either they were too loud (I thought my heart rate was escalating as the music kept pumping) or just destroying my favourite songs. Free entertainment is wonderful. However, auditions should be mandatory. No one really wants to be covering their ears almost the entire time. \n\nWas really lucky this year and found parking nearby.
