Picture this. Naked high school show choir on crack. That's Jubilee!  Amazing outfits with tons of feathers and sequins. Gigantic 2 story props with smoke and fire, and they move! And nudity! What's not to love (if you're an ex-show choir member)? \n\nBook the show in advance to make sure that you get seats close to the stage, like we did, and you'll be so close that you can read the names of the dancers off the bottoms of their shoes. Shout out to Colette! Nice moves. :)
