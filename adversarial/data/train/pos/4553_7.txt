This is the type of buffet where stuffing yourself is a must and you don't feel bad about it. \n\nLas Vegas is home to tons of amazing buffets! Buffets are one of the main reasons I even come to Vegas! I've been to the buffet at Rio, Bellagio, Planet Hollywood, Aria, and Ceasars. The Bacchanal Buffet located in Ceasars is hands down the best buffet in Las Vegas!!!! \n\nThere are so many different types of food at the Bacchanal. Now usually when I go to a buffet I find that not all the styles of food are good. At the Bacchanal literally EVERYTHING is good. The dim sum, sushi, Italian, Mexican, carvory, seafood. It's all on point! You honestly can't go wrong with anything at this buffet. Even the dessert! They have everything from your typical creme brulee and gelato to unique stuff like shave ice and thai tea boba floats!!  \n\nAs Beyonce would say, FLAWLESS! Bacchanal is absolutely flawless. So if you're reading this contemplating if you should spend 3 dollar signs on a buffet...the answer is yes!
