Okay, I am not saying I'm some sort of burger connoisseur or anything like that. However, when it comes to my personal preference, this is hands down my favorite burger joint anywhere. I love burgers, almost just as much as I love my wife, but of course, burgers don't put out...let's just leave it at that. In fact, although I love burgers, I am not easily pleased (get your mind out of the gutter) when it comes to burgers.\n\nNow on to the food. When visiting BurGR, I like to order the Euro Burger, which is made with truffle aïoli, goat cheese, arugula, and oven roasted tomatoes. I love how I can request my burgers well done and they are still juicy when biting into them. Keep in mind that these are Gourmet Burgers, therefore, they aren't that big, however, what they lack in size, they pack with flavor. Every bite is a mouthful of deliciousness (hold your thoughts and stay on topic for crying out loud). I've been here 14 times so far, and I have yet to try any other burger on the menu as this has become not only my go-to burger, but easily my favorite burger, period. Damn, 14 times...I think I have a problem...Hi, my name is CD, and I am addicted to BurGR...\n\nAnd just when you thought this couldn't get any better, it does. A must have here is their Truffle Parmesan Fries, which are, hand cut fries, truffle parmesan, truffle salt, and truffle aïoli. OMG! These are amazing! Although one of these orders is enough to share, I prefer to get my own, otherwise my wife eats them all.\n\nThe only negative that I can find with this place is how long the wait can be sometimes. If you're impatient, or starving, perhaps you should try going during off-peak hours avoiding the lunch and dinner crowds.\n\nIf you didn't already gather that from my review, well, I definitely recommend this place.
