Decided to drop in to the new neighborhood local bar\/tavern to check it out. To be honest I had no idea anything was here before even though I drove past it hundreds of times. But when Naked City put its name on it, and their pizza in it, it was worth investigating.\n\nThe door opens to one big room, with a huge U-ish shaped gaming bar to the right. This bar stretches from one end of the large room to the other, I'm guessing 40 places? One of the larger bars I've seen. On this Sunday night around 5pm, it was packed with all the people checking it out. The rest of the room has a variety of booths and open 4 top tables. I didn't really wander around too much to check out all the stuff. Its a bar, same as most any other bar.\n\nService was good and friendly. They have a nice variety of beers on tap, and wine and hard liquor. It almost seems as if the bar itself isn't finished, there is seemingly plenty of room for storage and displays but they aren't used effectively. This is not one of those flashy upscale places, its a neighborhood bar. They have a nice set of large screen TV's for viewing sports. \n\nNow for the pizza. You can order by the slice, or by the size. Pizza's are square in shape. I had just a slice with ham and pineapple and it came out to about $5 and the slice was huge. I mean Huuuuuge. I barely finished it. And it was really tasty, a thicker crust that was crunchy, and lots and lots of cheese. Really great slice of pizza!\n\nStop by, check it out. I will be back for the pizza. Caution, it does get a little smoky in there, especially at the bar.
