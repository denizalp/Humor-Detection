What is with all my 2 stars reviews lately. Why is everything eh, I've had better. Well, this place definitely falls into that category. Came here for lunch with the lovely Lee L. We were discussing fajita's and this is the place we decided on. I was not impressed. Nothing about it stood out. The decor wasn't very Mexicany. Nothing inspiring. The menu was Ok, but man alive, I thought it was pricey. $8.95 for ONE TACO. You dont need glasses, you read correct eight dollars and ninety five cents for ONE TACO. The waiter insisted it's because it comes with rice and beans. (They must be magic beans!). I'd drive way across town to Taco y Taco for some damn delicious tacos' @ $2.19 each. (I could get 3 and have change to put in the gas tank!) Since I am apparently no longer a vegetarian, I went with the steak fajitas' for $11.95 (seemed much more reasonable). It had FIVE pieces of steak. Yes, FIVE. I counted. Lee, who ordered the chicken fajitas, had quite a bit more chicken in her dish. The taste was good and I really enjoyed the flour tortilla's, but not enough for me to go back. The service was ok. Again, nothing spectacular. As a side note, they dont accept Amex :(\nI guess I am still on a quest to find delicious fajitas. Maybe I should just give up.
