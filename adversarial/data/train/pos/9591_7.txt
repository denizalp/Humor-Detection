Overdue review. Remember when we went kayaking? Was it even kayaking? Then we cycled around Harbourfront. Were they two different events?? Well I clearly don't remember, but I remembered THE PIZZA.\n\nIt was fatty pizzas after baking in the sun and cycling for an hour and a half. And walking for two more hours. We ordered 3 pizza's for our 6 people cycling team. The pizzas were so good!!!!! Panago has a huge list of pizzas plus you can customize. It's a little pricier than other pizza chains, but they have a LOT of more delicious options. Well worth it!!!
