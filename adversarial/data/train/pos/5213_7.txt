The arcade section is a nice addition and replaces the stage area from the Western, but needs some work. Both pinball games were broken, but only one had a sign showing it was OOO. It's cool they had both Street Fighter 2 CE and Mortal Kombat, also Lethal Enforcers and Rampage. There were at least five more arcade games on top of that, as well as skeeball and darts. Two complaints - the change machine was either broken or out of quarters by midnight. And having one end of the shuffleboard table right next to the arcade entrance means drunks will be bumping into each other.\n\nThey have a killer selection of beer and liquor, and the combo prices for a shot and beer are almost Westside-prices. Music is somewhat random - I'm guessing Pandora. The problem is the King doesn't have a theme or mission. King of bars? Ok - so what does that really mean besides a different spin on a dive with a heavy history of rotation (Sugar Shack, Grady's and Pal's)? It's cool that they say you can check your attitude at the door, but the high times of the Scottsdale\/AZ nightlife are way past that point anyway. I like the general concept of the bar\/arcade, and they finally put up neon beer signs indicating there's a bar to the random drunk passerby. I hope the spot does well. If the King's not the place for you, one can head East for general Old Town douchebaggery or go next door to laugh at Howard Hughes at Stand-up Scottsdale.\n\nhttp:\/\/www.spike.com\/episodes\/206c0b\/bar-rescue-meat-sauna-season-3-ep-310
