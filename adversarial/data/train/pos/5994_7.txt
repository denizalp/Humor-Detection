2.5 stars.\n\nStopped by tonight after having dinner at a pizzeria nearby.  Never been, but had prepared myself to expect a smaller location compared to that at Ray Rd. and the 101 (my fave!).  Was surprised to notice an unpleasant smell (akin to what Asian supermarkets tend to smell like with their stocks of rice and the odors that emanate from their meat shops) just as I entered the market, which continued as I entered the produce department.  \n\nThis place is small!  The \"olive bar\" consisted of maybe 8 (max) containers the size of small bread loaves.  Pathetic, but what can you expect from a converted Wild Oats?  The selection of meats looked fresh, though (beef top loin is on sale at $5.99\/lb., while center-cut pork chops are $2.99\/lb!).  While the cheese counter is small, it did showcase fresh-looking items, and the whole store, in general, looked clean and was brightly-lit.  I couldn't find my favorite Wellshire bacon (peppered uncured), but I was able to find the only tasty whole-grain whole wheat bread I can enjoy w\/o pain (Natural Bread Co.'s Honey Whole Wheat), albeit there was only one loaf available to buy!  And I quickly had a glimpse of their bulk section... Thank God I was full, or I'd have stopped for some sweets!\n\nIn a pinch, I'd stop here for emergency re-stocking, but I'll probably head over to the Tatum\/Shea or Mayo locations (both of which I haven't visited, yet!) to get my dining-at-Whole Foods fix!
