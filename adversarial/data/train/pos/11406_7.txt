This chiropractor cracks me up. Don't worry about scheduling an appointment because they are super flexible and they'll make all the adjustments necessary. Don't be spineless, get up the nerve and come in. They may have a bone to pick with you, but everything will straighten out in the end. Don't get bent out of shape if you have to go back more than once though.
