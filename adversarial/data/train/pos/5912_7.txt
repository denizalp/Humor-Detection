The Corporate Readiness Training Program at Bow Valley College is a wonderful program for skilled immigrants which helps them gain essential skills for transitioning to the Canada, and more specifically, Alberta work force.\n\nThe program provides new Canadians insight and hands on experience in learning how to get a job from researching job opportunities, networking, volunteering and learning and thriving in workplace cultures. A main focus of the program is English language and skill development in reading, writing, listening and talking. \n\nMy friend completed this program and was pleased with how nice and helpful the instructors were. She mentioned there was a 6 week unpaid placement at the end of the program to put into practice what she learned and was hired on after the 6 weeks.\n\nBow Valley College's Corporate Readiness Training Program should be one of the first things a new immigrant does to assist them in transitioning to the Alberta work place. Good work Bow Valley College!
