One of my favorite theaters!! Although it is part of the AMC chain theaters, this location at Town Square sets itself apart from the other AMC Theaters I am used to. \n\nFirst off, they have a bar for the 21+ peeps by the entrance and food area. This is the only AMC i know that has a bar for their guests to have a drink while watching a movie. \n\nSecond, the interior design is so fun and nice! I love how the hallways are super colorful. My favorite is the bathroom. Once you walk in, its a bright red (women's bathroom at least) and it just gives that clean feel. This theater is always clean - the hallways, bathroom, and theater rooms themselves. \n\nLastly, the theater rooms are HUGE!! i love it!! No need to worry for scoring a good seat because there is plenty. Even if i didnt get to the movie super early, I never had a problem of getting a good spot. \n\nOverall, great theater!
