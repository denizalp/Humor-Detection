There is so many different Asian restaurants in the area and deciding which one to eat at can be quite overwhelming especially if your eating out with a group of friends or family members. However, Wendy's is an excellent choice when needing a large variety of dishes but delicious and satisfying. The great thing about this place is the various dishes that are offered, from Chinese to various Southeast Asian Cuisine like Vietnamese, Thai, Indonesian and Malaysian. \n\nA few of my favorites and must try:\nTom Yum Goong Fried Rice- Spicy and a bit sweet, so good and I would personally come back for this dish.\nShanghai Dumplings- Balanced with a good amount of filling and not too much flour. \nChicken Wings- Delicious sweet and tangy flavor and great crispy texture.\nCoffee Float- Balanced coffee flavor that is not too strong but paired well with the vanilla ice cream. \n\nThe ambience is simple and modern. Most times the staff are attentive but they seemed overwhelmed during busy hours. However, the owner Wendy is very friendly and is usually around at the restaurant. She is a pleasant person and will do whatever she can to make sure your enjoying a great meal. For my siblings and I, Wendy is like an Auntie who has seen us grow up throughout the years. It will be a special place for us whenever we want good Asian comfort food.\n\n2017 Yelp Review #63
