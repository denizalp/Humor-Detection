Princess Nails gets the job done. They don't have a posh ambiance nor do they use new supplies; even though all salons are supposed to, few ever do. The lady doing my pedicure ($20) was quick, friendly and did a good job. Of all the times I've had OPI applied to my nails, it dried the fastest here. Not sure if it's because she put less coats or what, but it was nice not having to wait around for it to dry for +1\/2hr.
