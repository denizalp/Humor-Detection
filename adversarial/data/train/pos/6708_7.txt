You will NEVER find bibimbap for $7.08 here in San Francisco. I don't think you can even make it for $7.08. But in Toronto, the next best thing to Poutine is bibimbap at Buk Chang Soon Tofu. Nothing like a warm bowl of sizzling rice with egg and bulgolgi beef to warm you up and make you feel cozy all over!\n\nThanks to Buk Chang Dong Soon Tofu, my bf and I found ourselves returning to Koreatown all three nights of our stay in Toronto.
