I first had Long Wong's in the middle of a 28 hour shift.  I was starving, it was somewhere around 10 pm, I'd missed dinner, and the hospital cafeteria wasn't going to be open for two more hours.  Luckily I had some family members in town who brought me a burger from Long Wong's.  I devoured that thing and it tasted just like those $15 upscale burgers across town.  I had no clue where it had come from.\n\nSince then, I've actually been to Long Wong's restaurant.  I was completely in shock when I walked in - the outside building and interior didn't match up at all with what I had imagined.  It's super kitschy, with old-school video games lining the walls alongside that talking Mr. Fish that my grandpa has.  It's definitely not a date interior - pretty sure this must be a popular hangout for high school kids and anyone else stoned out of their mind - but the food really hits the spot when you're in a burger mood.  Much better than those big name fast food restaurants and much cheaper than those big name slow food restaurants.\n\nAll in all, I'm a fan and Long Wong's remains on my go-to list of unhealthy treats.
