I am so angry with you, Chompie's!!!  My sister and I were craving a Chompie's bagel so we swing by the PV Mall location to pick some up.\n\nWe were in there for over 20 minutes and exited WITHOUT A BAGEL and without our number being called.  We pulled #29 and it was on #26 the entire time we were in there... And when we would try to ask what was going on, we were SHUNNED!  SHUNNED?  I was trying to ask if we need to stand somewhere specific, ask why people coming in after us were already home eating their bagels.  But I couldn't even get that far.\n\nThis Goldstein is going somewhere else from now on.  Well, maybe.... Chompie's Bagels are so good, at least they used to be, I wouldn't know because I never got one!
