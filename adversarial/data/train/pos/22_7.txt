Tortilla Fish!! Best Fish Taco place in the valley! And it seems word of this has gotten out, I won't lie most of the time I go, I don't even check in because I wanted to keep this hidden gem to myself, but it doesn't matter anymore, somehow word got out!\n\nThe fish tacos are made to order, the fish is fresh and battered and fried, but you never have the greasy fried taste, it's always light and crispy. On Tuesdays, you can order 2 tacos and get the 3rd one free all for under 6 bucks. \n\nI have tied other items but my goto is the fish tacos, just fish and the freshly made tortillas, they have a great salsa bar that you can add your slaw to your tacos, you can spice it up jalapenos, toss in some onions and cilantro and hit with some hot sauce! Hot damn this are some great tacos!\n\nLike I said word has gotten out that this is a great taco shop and if your running short on time, hit up the Eat24 and place your order ahead of time, that's what I do.\n\nGreat food, great service and perfect for lunch or dinner!
