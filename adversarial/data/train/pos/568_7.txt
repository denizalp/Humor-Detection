No Rick. No Old Man. No Big Hoss. No Chumlee. No Antwuan. No Peaches. Oh, well. They probably make themselves scarce on weekends. I don't blame them. My friend got a picture with The Old Man a couple of months ago and he looked so depressed that his life has become a photo prop.\n\nObservations:\n\n*It's small!!! The main showroom is long and narrow.\n\n*The desk area, where the Old Man plays solitaire is even smaller. I can't believe the four of them can fit in that area. They don't allow photos of this area.\n\n*I noticed a lot of the items they bought that were featured on TV weren't there. Which means they most likely were sold. Everytime I watch the show and Rick says something like \"I don't have many people coming in looking for a ________.\" It ticks me off because it's on TV and people know you have it and the seller always falls for that argument. \n\n*They have a parking lot on each side of the store. One is full of taxis and the other small and full and hard to park. Just park on the street in back. Free and wide open.\n\n*I drove by once in the morning and the line to get in was around the block. Came back around 2pm and got in in about five minutes. \n\n*The T-shirts were just about all small, medium and then xxl+\n\n*They are in the process of adding on to the store.\n\n*You have to contact the show if you have something that you want to have considered for TV. Makes sense.
