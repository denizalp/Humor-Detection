Went for lunch . Ordered a $15 chicken sandwich (too expensive by any standard )\nWhich came with option of soup or salad . \nChose the Pasta Fagioli soup . Was gross lacked any seasoning , and was too starchy with only a few small pieces of pasta . It more  resembled a white bean  soup . Not good had to send back after 1 bite . Chicken sand. Was just meh.... \nDry sandwich with zero dressing \/ mayo or anything . Tomatoes were not fresh . Few small pieces of welted greens and again lacked any seasoning . \nThe person I came with ordered the lasagna which was burnt on the bottom . \nThis place used to be better . It pisses me off when restaurants just don't give a damn about taste and quality yet still want to charge double for a gross and disgusting sandwich. I will never return nor will I recommend to any1 with tastebuds . and I hope ur greedy asses go from Grand opening to Grand closing .... Get a new chef or start caring more .
