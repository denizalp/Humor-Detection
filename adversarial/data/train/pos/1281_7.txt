Short version:  Thousands upon thousands of pounds of beef.  Limited selection of Eisenhower-era cuts.  Good prices.\n\nIf you're a serial eater of barbequed striploin or rib steak, brisket, beef ribs, of filet mignon, you probably won't need to go anywhere else to fill your freezer.  Entire striploins are sold as 2-foot long monobloc logs, at a price often 60% or 70% of what the foodstore meat counter wants.  And, they'll cut your meat log to order, at whatever thickness you specify and packaged however you like, gratis. The ribs steaks, too.  I get my entire summer's weekend steaks there, every spring.  Inch and a quarter thick.\n\nThey're also the only place I've found that sells *large* pieces of uncooked corned beef in brine.  They offer similarly-uncooked pickled tongues and veal rolls, too.  If you're a corned beef-deprived Montrealer who needs a bit of a respite from smoked meat, drop everything and go buy one of their big, bloody bags of salt brisket.  Simmer it up at home in your biggest cauldron; save the stock for a mind-boggling pea soup.\n\nTheir smoked chickens and turkeys are worth a try, if you're into that.  Sold ready-to-eat.  There'll sometimes be half-chickens and quarter-turkeys on the shelves, too, especially around Xmas.\n\nReally good prices on bacon.  I can afford to use bacon as a seasoning, because of this place.\n\nLast little tip:  Try their steak spice.  Big bottle goes for, I think, 7 bucks.  Fantastic as part of a marinade, with either white vermouth or pale ale.  Not as salty as the foodstore brands.  Has a definite Rue St-Laurent flavor to it.\n\nThis place is a regular stop for me.  They'd get more stars if they had more than five cuts of beef on offer;  I'd buy bavette, rump steak, and porterhouses all day long, at their price levels.  But, since I'm a little round-heeled slut for a striploin or rib steak done right, and I own a barbeque, they've got me.
