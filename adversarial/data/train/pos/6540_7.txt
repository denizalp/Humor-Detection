Absolute trash. Gave these idiots every single item I needed moved. Came to the apartment unprepared with tools. Took almost an hour to get a couch out of the building. Slow as molasses. Ended up being $200 over the original estimate. Damaged multiple pieces of furniture and offered no replacement or repair. All they did was send me an $80 check for half an hour of each of the movers time. DO NOT DO BUSINESS WITH THESE PEOPLE. Extremely unprofessional!
