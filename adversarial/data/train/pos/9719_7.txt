Loved this place.  We are always looking for good authentic Indian and this place is it!   We went Americanized and got the chicken tiki masala and butter chicken with lots of nan.  All were really great.  The nan was really flavorful.  I especially loved the Garlic nan.  The  butter chicken was a little spicier than the masala, but both were awesome.  Their rice was really flavorful.  They add a few herbs to white rice and it puts it over the top.   Service was very good as well.\n   Yelp has a deal to get a mango drink for free, so I got this...it was so good!!! I would order that again.
