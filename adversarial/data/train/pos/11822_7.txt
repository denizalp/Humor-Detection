Where did the customer service go? Our server came to give us waters but left after that. It took about 20 minutes for someone to come and take our orders (we had to flag someone down). Once we ordered, it took another 30 minutes to get our food out, which is unusually long considering what our party of 3 ordered. Alongside that, I never had a refill of water the entire time. I tried to again, flag someone down for more water but no one came the entire time, only to bring us our checks.
