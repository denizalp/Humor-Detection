I absolutely LOVE Rachel's kitchen! Located in the District at Green Valley Ranch, Rachel's offers healthy affordable breakfast, lunch and dinner. \n\nThey have a decent selection of beer and wine that won't break the bank -like usually Vegas pricing. \n\nThey have a beautiful outdoor dining area that is pet friendly and has shade during the summer. \n\nCome by and have breakfast with a mimosa on the patio! You may run into me!
