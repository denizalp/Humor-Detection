iBlowdry to the rescue! \n\nWe had less than 6 hours to make it to Vegas to surprise our best friend for her wedding. She was eloping, unbeknownst to us, but a family member of the groom urged us to get our butts over there as soon as possible to make it to the ceremony. My best friend magically got us there in just under 4 hours so we had some time. We thought about booking an appointment to get blowouts for the 3 of us, specifically so the bride would look extra special. We called around and a lot of the salons were either about to close or were booked for the night. iBlowdry happily took us in and saved the night!\n\nWe were all offered mimosas during our visit and they were bottomless to boot. It's a hard pour so we had to pace ourselves or risk the bride flopping down the aisle. \n\nFor $35 each, we each got a blowout and style to our liking. We were on a tight schedule so we prefaced the fact that we had to be out in an hour or less. Each of the stylists did an awesome job at managing the time and still made us look beautiful. The only reason for the 4 stars was the slight disappointment in my own hair. I asked for a California, beachyish loose wave look but I came out looking like Farrah Fawcett circa 1976. \n\nLuckily, my curls straightened out a bit by the time the ceremony started so I wasn't hating as much in the end.\n\nThe salon is a bit off the beaten path away from the strip but it is worth the trip if you're looking to get dolled up for a night out in the city that never sleeps.
