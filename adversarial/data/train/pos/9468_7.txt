Not to happy after I picked up my babies. We let them board here over the weekend. We got the nail trim and courtesy bathe.\nWhen I picked them up they looked so nice and clean. But when we got home I notice they smelled like pee and there was dry poop on one of my babies back. My other baby had dry poop near his butt. I'm not even sure if they trim my dogs nails it's all filthy. \nSo I just had to give them a bath Myself. I thought about it.... I'm pretty sure this is this the last time I'm bringing them here. This is the 3rd time my Babies came out like this. I must say I back then in 2007-2011 this place was great. Now not so great. Sorry!\n\nSo apparently,  the staff that checked me out forgot to add on charges like there shots. And today, which is Sept. 4, 2014, I received a final notice of $60. But haven't received any other letter before that. But you know what! The lady that I spoke took was really professional and great about. Hope more of the staff's would be like her.
