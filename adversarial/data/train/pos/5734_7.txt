The Fatburger is located in the food court of Sunset Stations. There are seating areas where you can enjoy your food. It's somewhat quiet and out of the casino feeling. \n\nYou can tell the burgers are real meat and hand pressed because they have signs explaining their process  Also, when you get your burger it looks hand made. My husband saw a piece fall off and said it looked homemade-he came in without looking around. So we were all impressed with the appearance. \n\nThe flavor of the Fatburger is good and this is a better Fatburger than others around town. Good management makes a restaurant. The employee was a bit snippy (my son had not seen her before). My husband asked about the condiments that came on the burger and she just pointed. But otherwise a pretty good.\n\nThe steak fries were thick with a crispy outside and a soft potatoey (fun word) inside. They were hot out of the fryer and had a good flavor too.\n\nI recommend trying Fatburger if you want a quick lunch while at the casino. It's real food which is sometimes hard to find.
