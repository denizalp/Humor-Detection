This is the second location of La Mere, an authentic Northern Chinese (Beijing cuisine to be exact) street-food \/ comfort food style place with a French name (weird much?).  Compared to its original location at Finch and Midland, this place is slightly bigger with 8 tables and just as simply decorated.  \n\nTheir meat pies are awesome.  Each order is a large rectangular minced meat patty deftly flavoured with umani and spices, wrapped in a thin roti-like pancake and pan fried to perfect crunchiness on the outside.  You can choose from beef, pork, or lamb fillings.  Yum!\n\nI also love the dessert version pie which is #301 Sesame & peanut butter pancake.  It looks just like the meat pie, i.e., rectangular and with a crunchy skin on the outside, as you bite down be careful of the molten sesame-PB filling that will ooze out.  I almost burned myself taking too big a bite.  \n\nSolid 3.5 stars.  I will be back to try other stuff.
