Staff is really nice and professional.  Dentist a little weird and difficult to communicate with.  Discussing my teeth and he kept twisting what I was trying to tell him around of which was not what I was saying.  Very frustrated trying to get an appointment.  Then I found out I had to come twice for teeth cleaning?  I've never had to make 2 appointments for teeth cleaning with any other dentist.  Everything should be handled in one visit (unless it's something that came up that they can't handle).\n\nI also wasn't happy that they wanted to fluoridate my teeth.  I think by now everyone knows fluoride is not good for you...  Based on an article by Harvard School of Health, a study on fluoride \"found strong indications that fluoride may adversely affect cognitive development in children\" \"Fluoride seems to fit in with lead, mercury, and other poisons that cause chemical brain drain,\" Grandjean says. \"The effect of each toxicant may seem small, but the combined damage on a population scale can be serious, especially because the brain power of the next generation is crucial to all of us.\"\n\nNot very convenient.  Not impressed.  Will seek another dentist elsewhere.
