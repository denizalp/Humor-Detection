While attending the All American Foodie Fest we had the opportunity to try Rolling Fusion. \n\nMy fella and I tried the Thai fried chicken tacos. They were good. Small, but good. The chicken had good flavor. They were a little on the dry side and I had hoped for more of a coconut flavor. If I ever tried them again I'd likely ask for more sauce to use as a dip.\n\nThe service was friendly and we didn't have to wait long for our food like other food trucks we have tried in the past.
