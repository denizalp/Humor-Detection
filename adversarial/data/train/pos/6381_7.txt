This was a nice find. I love little hidden neighborhood eateries that serve great food. Really good authentic Italian food isn't always easy to find in Arizona. But Trattoria Arrivederci (\"farewell\" or \"see you later\" in Italian) is a staple here in the Valley and really offers a nice selection of Italian dishes on their menu. Chef Franco specializes in Nouvelle cuisine which is a more modern way of cooking that presents more lighter and delicate dishes with an emphasis on presentation. Owner Max Sahin helped opened this location in Ahwatukee in 2004 and was pleasant to chat with. When you walk in, you will notice that the lights are dimmed to offer a more intimate setting. The menu consists of a variety of pastas, seafood entrees and appetizers. Items are made from scratch using fresh ingredients and they also have a nice selection of wines to choose from. I took my mother here for dinner on a Friday night. Our server Morgan was a real pleasure to have as a server and really made our night. She shared a bit of her own Italian heritage and was very personable and friendly. I feel like this is something you don't see much in servers anymore. I have never tried lobster ravioli and she sold me on trying it. The dish was outstanding! The saffron cream sauce was nice and smooth and the ravioli are filled with generous portion of lobster tail and crabmeat. My mother got the Canneloni de Carne and really enjoyed it. Overall we had a really nice evening here. Probably my cons of the experience are that the parking can be a little tight and it was a tad bit warm in the restaurant for me (I'll admit I'm a cold weather guy). Arrivederci also has locations in Scottsdale and Fountain Hills.
