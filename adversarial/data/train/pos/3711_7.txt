My husband went to get a pizza from the Elyria location on Cleveland Street, and I happen to have a 6 year old son with Type 1 Diabetes. This is an autoimmune disorder and not caused by what he has eaten in the past. He does, however, need to know the number of carbs in EVERYTHING he eats so we can dose him correctly with insulin. To little insulin, he could die, too much insulin, he could die. \n\nWhen picking up the pizza, my husband asked for nutritional information; specifically carbs per serving.\n\nNo one knew anything. No one knew how to find out. This is the FIRST place I have ever encountered that cannot give this type of information. It may not seem serious to most, but it can be very life threatening for my son.\n\nI have now spent $22 for my child to not be able to eat. He is crushed. This diagnosis is hard enough as it is, on him.  Now we have to explain to him the best that we can, that he can't eat this pizza. \n\nI am baffled that a place that pretty much serves carbs on a platter can't tell me what the carb count is for their pizza. Diabetics beware - no one in the restaurant will be able to help you. Stay away. This is the first place I have EVER encountered that can't help with carbohydrates per serving(s)
