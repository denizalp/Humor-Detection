I thoroughly enjoyed my dinner experience. I made reservations day of and they said it was a little difficult to get outside seating, no big deal.  When we checked in the gentleman at the front told us to hold to wait as I requested outside and was willing to wait. A table opened up right in the middle and in between inside and outside. Perfect.\n\nThe water, music, light shows were great. The atmosphere was phenomenal and very enjoyable. Got a drink at the bar first and Billy was a cool guy who got along with everyone and made a great drink. Super friendly and personalized the experience, which was great \n\nThe bread assortment and flavored butter were a nice start to the meal. We got the domestic wagyu New York strip and split it and crisp potato rosti along with the baked fennel Mac and cheese. Our server Andres was attentive, very nice, suggested and agreed with our food selection when I asked questions or recommended other items as well. And he smiled throughout serving us. \n\nOverall experience, food, quality, ambience, staff service, and accommodations met and expectations. I'm glad I was able to eat here and I will again.
