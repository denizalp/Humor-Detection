Amazing green chili!  I loved the red too but prefer the green.  Rice and beans (either pinto or black) both fantastic!  Rice is YUMMMMM!  The chili plate didn't come with a tortilla so I really did miss that, but otherwise, fabulous!  The chips and salsa were super good!  I did prefer the red salsa over the green.  I want to try the enchiladas the next time I visit because I think that red sauce is going to make the best enchilada ever!! I will be back for sure!   YUMMMMY!!
