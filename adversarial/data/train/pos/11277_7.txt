I absolutely love this place! You cannot beat the deal for the service you get. This is a great getaway for couples and singles. It is a Korean style so they have a sex separated area where nudity is encouraged. I love that aspect of it. The only thing I wish they had was a hot tub for both sexes to go in so my love and I can share the experience. They are under new management and the customer service is much more friendly. I have gotten a deep tissue massage there and it was amazing! They have a lot of options to pick from, or you can just go and enjoy the spa. I loved it because I was able to study for my Real Estate License while being in the most relaxed and peaceful environment. The only reason it is not 5 is we are not allowed to bring our own food- which I understand why but I am a strict vegan and cannot consume anything they offer. They are hidden in the back of a parking lot so you cannot see them from the street. Do not be discouraged by the outside of the spa...it looks MUCH NICER on the inside. \n\nA GREAT PLACE FOR LOCALS AND VISITORS.
