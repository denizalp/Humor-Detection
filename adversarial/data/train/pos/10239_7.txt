The Skinny: so-so sushi and incorrectly cut sashimi (2.5) service is shamelessly trying to upcharge you and ignore you when you don't feel like playing along(1) value: given the fact that I've been to Korean sushi joints that served similar product, their outrageous prices do not match the quality of the food. (2)\n\nMy hubs and I came here about 2 years ago to sample their Valentine's Day omakase. Although there did appear to be a lot of cooked items, the quality of the food was enough to make us contemplate coming here again last week.\n\nWe arrived with a friend for some good eats but were disappointed on many levels.\n\nFirst of all, the service is highly lacking. Our waitress had the annoying habit of always trying to get us to order more expensive items on the menu. No, we do not want a miniscule bowl of edamame you want to charge $4.50 for when I can get a massive bag of it for less than $2. No, we do not want to order alcoholic drinks. No, we don't want any of your appetizers.\n\nAfter we kept politely declining her suggestions, she pretty much ignored us until she wanted to us to clear the bill. Which was frustrating because she didn't even bring out a bowl of rice that came with our meager meals. Not to mention that they removed our small plates when our food came out. \n\nLet me tell you, it feels totally ghetto eating out of their massive sashimi bowl because you are likely to drip soy sauce on the other pieces of fish. \n\nNot cool. Not zen. All ghetto. Sorry, but it had to be said.\n\nEnough about the shoddy service. More on the food.\n\nOur friend and I ordered the Sashimi Special Combination ($29.95) while the hubby got the Shin's Special Plate ($19.95).\n\nFor $19.95, the only special about Shin's Special Plate is how epic a rip it is. Although beautifully presented, the fish texturally, lack the firmness of really fresh product. The size of the fish on the nigri was also on the thinner side. Although the seasoning of the various fish was varied, the pairing of flavors were only okay in my books. Nothing terribly innovative. And for 7 pieces of nigri, it is very expensive.\n\nThe sashimi special combination (sashimi plate, bowl of rice, miso soup) for $29.95 is also very expensive for what it was. The thin slices, the small portion size left me very disappointed. Top it off with fish that wasn't the finest quality (I went on a Thursday - no excuses!), I cannot recommend this dish to anyone.\n\nOverall, it's disappointing because there are very few decent sushi joints in town. But between the shoddy service, the lackluster fish quality and the skimpy portions, this place gets a 2 star.
