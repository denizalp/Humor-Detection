Words cannot paint an accurate portrait of this amazing establishment. I watched army soldiers run next to naval cadets, in an air force gym where marines were working on drown proofing. GOD bless AMERICA!!! \n\nThis place literally has everything.\nIndoor poor\nIndoor track\nBikes\nBasketball courts\nRacquet ball courts\nA kids play center\nFree weights\nTRX suspicion trainers\nA Crossfit section\nLarge lockers\nAnd yes a smoothie bar\n\nAll of that in one place, plus your surrounded by some of America's greatest volunteers. I love it, I absolutely love it. To top things off they have a track at the rear of the gym if you want to jog outside. If there was anything to compmain about it would have to be....yeah I got nothing :) thanks Nellis AFB.
