Five minutes into a rock show, I got really excited. So excited, in fact, that I did some kind of aerial ninja moves and (crunch) broke my foot.\n\nI hobbled to urgent care after all the excitement was over and I had a night to beg the ceiling that nothing was broken. In the morning, my dark purple, painful, and wonky looking foot left me with no question. The doc at urgent care was nice enough, but left me with a kind-of-sideways, ace-bandaged splint that made my pain worse. In comes Dr. Roeder.\n\nI'm not sure when doctors' offices became efficient, but my mind was blown by how quick everything came together. Even so, I never felt that the visit was rushed. Paperwork, 2 minutes of friendly chatter with the front office lady, then right back to see Dr. Roeder. He was a pleasant conversationalist, smart, and thorough. Between jokes, he laid out 3 treatment options and left it up to me... surgery if I were an athlete who needed to heal in 3 weeks, a cast if I'm a kid and\/or can't trust myself to wear a boot (sometimes I wonder), and a boot if I was a functioning adult. Boot it was! He also picked up on another foot issue I didn't mention and gave me some suggestions so I could avoid future surgery. Bam, excellence.\n\nI left with a boot, my urgent care crutches, plenty of recommendations, and a plan for a speedy recovery. I will absolutely go back in four weeks, and I will absolutely go back if I have any other foot mishaps! :)
