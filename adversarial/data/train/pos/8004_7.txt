I'll be honest that I went here despite of being absolutely sick of eating korean bbq. I go once or twice a week to Gens and I gotta say I'm tired of it. Once this place opened and my brother insisted of trying it, I went along with for lunch and I'll be honest, it's very good! Walking in, the atmosphere is nice and clean. If anyone has been to the California location in San Marcos,this is the same one! With the banchan being typical, they have cilantro and onions in a sweet, sour and spicy sauce that was amazing. The meat quality here is great, and I will have to say, almost better. Thick cut galbi and a 12oz steak was amazing. It was tender and full of flavor. They also have unlimited steamed egg so that's basically life right there. The brisket portion was huge, like I'm talkin you can feed 6 people with that. The portions here are plentiful. With 2 people coming in ready to eat I was overwhelmed with the thick cut, and large proportioned meat. This is probably gonna be my next visited kbbq spot once I get back from my hiatus of kbbq. The owner is a friendly guy and I talked to working with him in the future. The service not to mention was also very friendly. I'm glad to once again put aside my korean bbq overload to try this place.
