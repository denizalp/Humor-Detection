Wow. Really?! Who gives a f**k if we look like tourists carrying these Fat Tuesdays around?! It only looks stupid for the people who live in Vegas anyway, and must suck for you guys too since you can't stay at the lavish hotels like we can.  And yeah, we may be all over that 'Adult Slurpee' machine but Vegas is an 'Adult Playground' so the two go hand in hand.\n\nSo with that said, Fat Tuesdays ARE THE BUSINESS. They are perfect for when you want to get your drink on during the daytime yet don't want to pass out and miss out on the night's festivities.  It's fun to carry around and if you finish it and return with the bottle, the refill is a dollar or two less I believe.  My favorite flavor is the strawberry mixed with mango.  It not only tastes amazing but looks amazing too. =) It's a must for any Vegas trip!
