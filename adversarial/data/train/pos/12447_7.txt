I'm glad to see that I'm not the only person rating this restaurant with only 1 star.  In fact, if I can give ZERO, I would.\n\nI don't care how trendy this restaurant looks.  \n\nFirst thing first, the sushi is way over priced.  $40 for 2 tiny pieces of Toro and it's OLD toro which was chewy and NOT fresh.  I've had way better Toro so yes, if I made a face eating your crap and it shows, deal with it.\n\nService was so-so.  The waiter could barely hide his disappointment when we opted for green tea (at around $5-$10 a pot) versus sake or other alcoholic drinks.  \n\nThe rest of our sushi order was so-so.  Really nothing spectacular that you cannot find in a decent sushi place.  Nothing stood out.\n\nI sat in front of the chefs who barely communicated amongst themselves and not once with the customers.  It was kind of sad actually.  The sushi production was akin to a factory line.  It's also ridiculous that I have to communicate my order to my waiter who then had to convey the order to another server who had to walk 30 seconds to the chef to finally give the order.\n\nWho was making the sushi right in front of me.
