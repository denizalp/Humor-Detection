Dinner at Twist by Pierre Gagnaire was my most hotly anticipated night out of 2016.  It's not everyday that I make reservations to a restaurant well over a month in advance, anxiously counting down the days.  \n\nOf course, with anticipation for Chef. Gagniere's culinary creations running high, so were the expectations.  Thankfully, Twist didn't just meet my expectations; it exceeded them completely.  Most importantly, a meal at Twist is more than just a meal -- it's a culinary experience that anybody who enjoys creative, avant-garde food should try at least once.\n\nReservations were at 6pm on a Friday evening.  Just finding Twist is a bit of an adventure, since you have to take the Mandarin Oriental elevator up to the 23rd-floor sky-lobby, and then follow a discreetly labeled, dimly lit corridor to the restaurant.  Once there, though, I was greeted by beautiful glass, butterfly sculptures, and a bouncy, energetic host.  Before long, I was whisked away to a window seat with a breathtaking view of the Strip, with Sauvignon blanc in one hand and a decadent spread of bread and butter in the other.\n\nTwist offers an a la carte menu, but it's way more fun to order a tasting menu.  I recommend the 5-course tasting, which provides a massive, extravagant feast without a stratospheric price point.  In actuality, it's far more than 5 courses, once the various amuse bouches, palate cleansers, and desserts are counted.\n\nHere's the rundown of what I tasted:\n\n** ARRAY OF AMUSE BOUCHES: This included 6 (!!!) distinct items, ranging from a savory cheese pastry, to a martini jello shot-type thing.  \n** FIRST COURSE: Poached black cod with black olive gelée, star anise-scented potato mousseline, and summer herbs.\n** SECOND COURSE: White asparagus with smoked salmon, asparagus\/tarragon velouté, and mortadella.\n** THIRD COURSE: Lobster souffle with fennel, peas, fava beans, and calamansi citrus beurre deux.\n** PALATE CLEANSER: Spicy grapefruit sorbet with yogurt cream.\n** FOURTH COURSE: Rabbit saddle with root vegetables, nougatine, sweet and sour jus, and cold terrine of rabbit leg rolled in herbs.\n** SIDE DISHES: Green bean\/sesame salad, ratatouille, morels with coffee, and Swiss chard\/bacon gratin.\n** FIFTH COURSE: Grand dessert consisting of 5 (!!!) distinct items, ranging from a strawberry pastry, to a mango tart, to panna cotta served in a martini glass.\n** PETIT FOURS: An array of four different candies, including a French macaron, chocolate candy, and jelly candy.\n\nThe word to describe all of these items is *complex*.  This is food that makes you think, challenges your palate, and expands your idea of what food should taste like.  It's exciting, it's bold, and it's (if you're a food nerd) it's a lot of fun too.\n\nThe service at Twist is just as entrancing as the food.  The staff was eager to get all of my feedback -- positive and negative -- about every dish, in an attempt to further refine the ever-changing menu.  When I casually mentioned that the cheese pastry was my favorite of the amuse bouches, one of the small army of servers tending my table brought out a whole plate of them -- at no charge.  The staff at Twist go above and beyond to pamper their guests, and the effort pays off nicely.  A nice touch was the souvenir menu given to me as a parting gift.\n\nIn the rarefied spaces of upscale Vegas dining, Twist truly stands out.  Nobody else in town is doing food as innovative, clever, and thoughtful as Chef. Gagniere, so check out Twist if you have a chance!
