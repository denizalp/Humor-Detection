2-1\/2 stars (Cake Balls Review Only!)\n\nThe phrase \"Let them eat cake\" is most often associated with Marie Antoinette although there is no historical record that she actually uttered them.  She's often viewed as a royal who only cared about indulging and lavishing in the finest, and I'm sure back in the day a g√¢teau was a delicacy indeed!\n\nCakes have become as symbolic of birthdays as Santa Claus is with Christmas.  But for me, no matter what occasion - cake is always welcome!  But for me, the culinary adventurer - I thought I would jazz it up a bit for my mom's birthday.\n\nI had had a voucher to Sweet Sushi by Jessica for $40 worth of cake balls ($2 each for a total of 20 cake balls).  Jessica is a graduate from George Brown's culinary program and started her business with a passion for sweets and a flair for creativity.  Her signature products are in the name - sushi made of Rice Krispies and wrapped in candy.  She operates out of her home in Thornhill, which is where you will go to retrieve your order.  Orders must be placed at a minimum of 24 hours in advance.  The ordering and pickup process went flawlessly, and Jessica is a really down to Earth kinda gal!\n\nI had an assortment of cake balls including the following flavours:\n\nRed Velvet\nCarrot Cake\nPina Colada\nChocolate Mint\nBrownie Glitter\n\nVerdict:\n\nThese cake balls are definitely unique and visually appealing.  The cake part of the cake balls were quite moist.  The outer shells, made of chocolate however, made it hard to cut them in half.  I found them all to be extremely rich; the richness coming from the chocolate coating.  I also found them to be too sweet for my palette.  Make sure you have a glass of coffee, milk or tea nearby!  My favourite flavour bar none was the Carrot Cake as it was the least sweet of all the cake balls I sampled.\n\nWith that said, if you can tolerate a richer and sweeter dessert - I think that you should definitely give Jessica a call.  Despite it being too sweet for me, I would still call Jessica again as her masterpieces are sure to be the talk of any party and sure to please the dessert crowd!
