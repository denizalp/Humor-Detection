I can't believe I haven't written a review for Pure.\n\nPure is usually our go-to spot, but now it's a no-go spot.  Well okay maybe just the night we went.  We got there around 1AM and the staff is at least accomodating (especially to girls). Ladies, DO NOT pay at this place. If you have to pay, you aren't trying hard enough! \n\nBut I'd like to make a request to the Pure management, can ya'll make a requirement about a deodorant check at the door?   I've been to my fair share of jammed pack clubs with no ventilation, but for some reason, it seems like all the people with the lack of personal hygeniene like to frequent this place.  The dancefloor was STANKIN'.  I nearly gagged a few times. Please Pure, maybe you should have a mist of  Degree anti-persperant as you enter the club like they do with the kryo machine. \n\nOther than that, you can't beat some sick ass house music on the roof top over looking the strip.  \n\nTIP: There's a ladies bathroom at the upper left corner if you are facing the VIP stage, go there, literally no lines atall.
