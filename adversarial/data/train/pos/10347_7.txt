Let me start that hands down this spot for breakfast is the best in town and my go to for classic breakfast dishes.  \n\nThe location is right in the heart of Old Town Scottsdale and is very easy to find. There is parking on the street and a few parking spots that are not too far, but I usually go early for breakfast, so this may not be the case later on in the day when its far hotter during the AZ summer. \n\nThe spot has plenty of seating, including some outside and a bar.  There are tables and booths and its nice yet very casual. \n\nFor less than $15 (which includes a non-alcoholic bev, I usualy get coffee--it's very yummy here and you can grab one while you wait and even ask for one to go). I am a fan of the omelettes and really like the veggie, turkey, capreses and steak. To be honest I haven't tried one I don't like. The acorn squash hash is so sweet and savory served with an herbed creme fraiche--I ALWAYS get it instead of the potatoes (however, my guests LOVE them, I am a bigger fan of squash). The breakfasts are HUGE, like really generous.  The eggs come with hash, a small bowl of fruit and a side of bread, which can be a biscut or bagel. They have an amazing kids menu as well filled with real food for the kiddos.  The hosts and staff have always been so sweet to my toddler daughter and any guests I bring with. They serve alcohol as well, i don't think I've tried anything but the Bloody Marys look amazing. \n\nThey've never let me down, so I'll keep heading over to this spot for breakfast. If you are in the area, I encourgage you to try it too!
