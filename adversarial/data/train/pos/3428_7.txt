Añejo may translate as \"aged\" but you could not find a more youthful atmosphere.\n\nYou walk up to this restaurant and you know you're in for a treat. Not only are all of the patrons happy and outgoing but it's obvious that the staff are having a great time as well. When you have the perfect trio of tacos, tequila, and great company how could you go wrong? I managed to get my party to order all of the kinds of tacos so that I could sample them all. I was impressed with all of the tacos. They were all uniquely flavored and filling (you only need three). I am not a huge fan of battered fish in tacos, so I would recommend either the chicken, beef, or pork and you won't go wrong. Also, the staff provide great service and are very nice.\n\nIf you're not already ordering the guacamole you're making a terrible life choice. Made right in front of your eyes as you drool over how delicious all of the fresh ingredients look. The chips they provide are the perfect delivery system for this tasty substance.\n\nDo you like spicy foods? Do you like really really spicy foods? Okay then you need to talk to the staff and get a bottle of their homemade hot sauce. This tasty sauce is hot enough to spice up your tacos and provide that little extra taste that you didn't even know was missing.\n\nDessert time: You don't need any more food, get tequila! Grab a shot of that delicious coconut flavored tequila and keep the night going.\n\nIf you like Mexican, you can't dislike Añejo because then you'd just be wrong.
