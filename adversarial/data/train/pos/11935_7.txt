My boyfriend got his brand new sneakers (Air Max 95 original colors) stolen from right out of his duffle bag in the hotel room.  He filed a complaint and we found out that they almost immediately shredded it.  \n\nLesson learned.  Don't ever stay at a 2 or 3 star hotel just to save a bit of $.  Always get a room with a safe, even though no one really would put their shoes in a safe. :\/\n\nSo, Zero Stars and we're never returning to Quad ever again!!  Never!!!
