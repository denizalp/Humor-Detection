I beg you please....please...please don't go here. Unless you enjoy meat that's been cooked to death and you consider grease a condiment.  I use to work down the street from this location and literally swerved across three lanes when I saw that one magical word that gives me a raging hunger hard on every time I see it...TAQUERIA.  I walked in and ordered three tacos. 1 Asada, 1 Pastor, and 1 Lengua.  All were terrible. The lengua had an indescribable funk to it. The asada was good, well that is if you like chewing on a leathery horse dong that's been baking in the senora sun. The pastor sucked and everything was soaking in greasy diarrhea sauce. So if your jonesen for a leathery horse dong soaked in diarrhea sauce you'll love this place, if not you will be severely disappointed. THIS PLACE SUCKS.
