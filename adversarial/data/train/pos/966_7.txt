A happy culinary adventure! I have been meaning to try Felice for couple of years now and finally made it out there. My wife and I sat at a cute table on their back patio - complete with a bar, fire pit, and bocce ball court! \n\nThe diverse menu with sharable plates, small plates, and large plates, allows you to curate your own unique dinner experience. We ended up treating it almost like a tapas menu, ordering a few small plates and a couple drinks then going back for more. We started with the roasted mushrooms in a rich tomato sauce and crostini (Great!), the garlic shrimp which had plenty of garlic (Delicious!), and grilled octopus that was served with citrus and fresh veggies so it resembled a ceviche (Not to my taste).\n\nIt was at the point in the evening that the thunder and rain came! The staff was very helpful and ushered us from the patio to the dining room without missing a beat - told you it was an adventure! We finished our meal with asian inspired calamari with a crunchy slaw and ginger sauce and some spicy chorizo empanadas. They also have a very nice craft beer list and some lovely cocktails!
