Yeah why don't I go for bubble tea more? It's so 1996, you know? Back then you had to survive the exotic wilds of the Pacific Mall's parking lot to find a bubble tea place. You had to go with a Cantonese guide. Today it's the Flaming Moe of non-alcoholic ethnic youth drinks. The short walk from the Finch Station to the North York Centre station features about half a dozen bubble tea joints.\n\nTea Shop 168 is one of the first to Tipsy McStagger bubble tea into a chain format. \n\nOn a whim, I went with a coworker and his GF to the North York location. I walk by this place nearly every day and marvel at the weird stuffed animals in giant baby bottles. One might think \"why would anyone buy one of those sober?\" but having spent time in Korea I know the best way to woo one of the Daughters of Tangun is via a stuffed animal stuffed in a baby bottle. Is it any so different from, say, cutting the sleeves off your Metallica tshirt and trying to impress the ladies with your guns?\n\nAnyway, there are a lot more exotic flavors on the menu as compared to 1996. I had the caramel pudding bubble tea with caramel gelatin bits and tapioca balls. I might not have it again. My coworker and his gf had the garlic squidballs. I sampled one while they were in the washroom and I give them a thumbs up.\n\nThis place does get busy Friday night after 10 pm. Even though it's -10c out and the principle feature is cold tea. But ultimately it's pretty fun. The waitresses are cute and the service is good. There are board games. You don't even have to move your fat ass to get them. The waitress will bring them to you. And there are all manner of Chinese and Japanese fashion magazines to peruse. I saw no Korean language magazines. Odd, given we're plunked right down in k-town north.
