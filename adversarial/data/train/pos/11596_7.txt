If I were grumpy today, I would give this place just one star.  During our fall break, the husband and I were knocking out quite a few of the best new restaurants in Phoenix Magazine, and this happened to be one of them.  I was pretty excited because I really like barbecue and it's fun to compare different places.  Unfortunately, this place didn't compare to any other BBQ place.  I honestly thought it was terrible, almost to the point of being inedible.\n\nThe restaurant itself is pretty cute.  I love the old western movies playing, the decor is rustic and cute, and its very clean inside.  Unfortunately, it must have been a really really REALLY off day for them, especially considering the raves from Deb (and I trust her reviews.)  I ordered the beef brisket with a side of the Cowboy Olive Cole Slaw.  It sounded fascinating.  Before our meal arrived I got some extra BBQ sauce, and that was the first indicator that this would be no good for me.\n\nHonestly, the sauce tasted like hot sauce with a little bit of ketchup in it.  It was really watery, and I like really thick sauces.  I just really hated the flavor.  My brisket was terribly dry and overcooked.  There was no falling apart as I cut it, mostly just sawing motions to get through the nearly 1\/2 inch slab.  I think brisket should be cut much thinner than that.  Fortunately, there was a decent smokey flavor that was present, and that made my meat palatable.  I figured the cole slaw would be better.  It wasn't.  It really just tasted like someone emptied a can of olive juice into a generic batch of cole slaw.\n\nThe only thing worth eating here was the baked potato salad, but it wasn't my side dish to eat.  This place was a big ol let down for me.  Like I said, this must have been a really bad day for them, because I don't think you win one of the best new restaurant spots for nothing.
