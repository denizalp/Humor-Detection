Does this hotel need another glowing review?  Likely not, but I want to expound on my love for it, even having only stayed there for one amazing day.\n\nI LOVE ENCORE!  I was able to get a fantastic deal to stay here, and was completely blown away by the level of service my friends and I received at this hotel.  From the moment we pulled up to the valet, I felt like a queen.\n\nOur room was on the 36th floor with a view of the strip and the pools below.  I had no issue with noise, but that's probably because I was at the club responsible for many of the noise complaints I've read about until it closed for the night.  Upon opening the door to our room, I was filled with a sense of luxury and comfort far above that of any other hotel I have ever stayed in.  The suites are spacious and beautifully appointed with plenty of space.  I wanted to take all the pillows home with me, they were so comfortable (and apparently you're able to buy them!)  \n\nEven though our stay was extremely brief, I was so impressed by my experience at Encore.  I can't wait to return.
