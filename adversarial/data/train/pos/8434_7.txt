Run and don not subject yourself to the headaches and aggravation you will experience by going here.  Not only will you feel like a low life after your first consult especially if you are on pain medication, but they belittle you as well.  This place is not concerned about your pain.  This doctor and NP's alike have obviously entered this business with the intention of making money not worrying about their patience well being.  I came to this facility on a walker 2 weeks after a surgery that saved me from paralysis.  The NP that gave me the consultation made me well up with tears after he gave me a long speech about pain medication addiction and how he will not play games with me etc.  Meanwhile not even taking into consideration the sheer devastation i had just gone through of almost never walking again. The least he could do was have a little bed side manner and tact. But you will not get that from this office.  I had MRI's done that were never discussed with me. I had one bad experience after another with this place  I could go on and on about this facility, because I didn't know that I could go to another pain management clinic i thought that I had to stay there because I was referred by my doctor.  Thank God I finally found a new facility I can trust.  One that cares about me and my well being not their pocket books only.  Even after i finally left this place, while requesting my personal records they lied to my current Dr. about procedures done, and never sent over my records after being requested multiple times. A FREAKING NIGHTMARE!!!!  Believe me, I am not just the type to write negative reviews about places.  Frankly I am the one who leaves great reviews, but this place is far from acceptable.  Good luck and don't believe all the reviews they put on their website, because anyone can write fake testimonials.
