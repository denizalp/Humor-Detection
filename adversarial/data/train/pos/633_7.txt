When I first stopped in here shortly after they opened, I ended up walking out. There was a family of 4 in front of me and they literally took like over 10 minutes to get their order. Also glanced at their poke toppings and options looked very limited. \nDue to some good reviews from my Yelp friends, I thought I'd give them another chance yesterday. Instead of eating there, I asked my hubby to bring some take outs. He came back with something amazing. The fish was fresh and they had far more options than before. The employee stated that they did in fact added more options. I was also flabbergasted that they had 'kimchee' as a topping. \nOverall, it was really good and since this poke spot is closer to home, I will be eating here more frequently.
