My sister and I went out in China town on a Friday night craving sushi. Not wanting to wait 90 minutes for a spot, I asked her if she had ever had Korean BBQ, she said \"Yes!\" and this is where we ended up.\n\nThe reason I ask is because I am not one to opt for foreign cuisine when I don't know what to expect and I want someone to tell me what to do. Once I've been gone, I can fly solo and introduce friends to something new and exciting.\n\nWe walked in and there were little booths set up in rows, all with big, circular grills as centerpieces to the tables. It was BBQ-ing indoors. There were several types of beef (tongue, rib, etc.), there were fresh shrimp, and a few pork options. It really is carnivore paradise.\n\nThere were few veggie options in the form of a salad bar, there was some other prepared Asian food, sweet and sour pork, sushi, tempura veggies, and various other salads (along the lines of macaroni, but Asian, not sure what they are called).\n\nMy drink glass was never empty and they made sure to clean out our grill when it got too messy.\n\nThis was definitely different and I love it! A must try!
