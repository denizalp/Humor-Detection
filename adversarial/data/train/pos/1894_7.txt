Food is what you would expect from a typical pizza joint.  Made an order late before it closed asked them to call and not use the doorbell as my gf was sleeping.  Driver used the door bell woke up my gf who then stayed up with me to talk and ate half my poutine.  This order was placed for 1 not 2 and they fucked up my alone time.  Poor delivery good pizza joint.
