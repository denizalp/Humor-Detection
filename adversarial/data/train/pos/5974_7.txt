Coming here on Valentines day the restaurant was packed and we got a place at the pizza bakery counter having a great look into the kitchen.\n\nWell, where to start: the pizza was good after we finally got it. Lets go back to the beginning.\n\nWe, a group of two, arrived at 5pm and ordered our drinks and a pizza each. Sitting at the pizza counter we saw at least 6 people responsible to bake pizza: starting from the guy who prepared the pizza dough, 2-3 people preparing the pizza, 1 person restocking the supplies, 1 person responsible for the oven and one who took care of the pizza after it came out of the oven preparing it for the servers.\n\nWow - I remembered a saying: Too many cooks spoil the broth. \n\nAnd this was definitely the case here. I have never seen so much wastage of pizza because the dough was ripping, the pizza was burned, the order was mis-read or the guy baking it just ripped it in the oven. The guys were constantly switching positions and lost track about the orders. There was no visible 'chef' organizing the line.\n\nOur order of two pizza arrived around one hour after we sat down.\n\nFor us it looked like it would have worked way better with half the staff only but clear tasks for everyone involved. But it looked they simply hired more staff and tried to win with quantity instead of quality.\n\nOnce again - the pizza at the end was good, but imaging how good it would have been 30 minutes earlier at my table with less waste and better efficiency ... this would also mean better profit for the owner and\/or lower prices for the customer!
