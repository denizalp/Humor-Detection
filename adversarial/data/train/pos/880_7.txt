Definitely one of the whitest Asian cuisines I've ever been to. I thought this place would be really great, from seeing the nice sign and the clean interior AND seeing as it is run by asians. \n\nThe service was quick, not particularly too friendly and the food came even quicker but I was not impressed. The ginger tea I ordered (I was feeling sick and ginger soothes a nauseous tummy #protip) came in an extremely small teapot, smaller than the actual cups of water we received. Also, most places offer free refills on tea because the tea bag is still inside & all they have to do is fill up hot water. However, it was strictly only steeped ginger tea and even though it was only about $2, I wasn't impressed. The coconut chicken soup was milky and tasty, but super oily.. I also ordered the fusion chicken mango salad, which was indeed tasty and tangy. My boyfriend ordered the pad thai with chicken, which he found to be extremely heavy. The food tastes as though a Caucasian person was dared to create an authentic asian meal only with the help of YouTube & without ever having tasted it themselves. Honestly felt like it was Thai express to me..But maybe it's because I expected too much.\n\nPrices are not bad but the portions are pretty small for the most part. I wouldn't make a promise to come back here in the future.
