Whats worse: an ex-con burger flipper who actually barks at you for your order, a filthy condiment bar, cash only, a cashier that walks up and asks you for your drink order and then walks across the restaurant as he goes and clears a table after he just asked you a question, or the fact that if you don't have cash you get to pay an extra $4 on top of your $5-7 burger to use their cute little ATM machine.\n\nI KNOW: the fact that for some reason people completely overlook it all: \"If you go to ASU, you have to go to Chuck Box! So good dood.\"\n\nI was in line, realized I had no cash and began to turn around to go to the ATM up the street. Spatula Master must have noticed that I was about to eff-up his patty streak before his next Skoal break, and shot me that \"I'll put 50 wounds into your torso with this Bic pen\" look, to which I respond: \"I'll be right back\" \nAnd the response I get: \"OOOK? Whatever!\"\n\nReally? :-O\n\nI would have left, but I was there with friends - damn.\n\nThey even have a sign posted claiming that they take cash only because they need to speed up the line. I got an idea: how about you employ more than TWO PEOPLE to service your entire restaurant. No? OK, waste my time and my money instead. I get you. Oh but, that can't be so, not if your website states:\n\n\"Besides a cold beer and a burger, I'll be here to greet you with a smile and a hug.\n- Big Juan\"\n\nBig Juan must've gotten mugged by the two thugs working the grill at burger number 278. Poor Big Juan, I'd probably like this place if he was still around: I was able to make a pretty tasty burger out of a 1\/3 lb. on wheat with pepper jack, jalapenos, and onion.\n\nAnd no, this isn't what it means to be a Hole in the Wall; go up the street to Pollo Supremo: literally nothing but nice Mexican ladies serving you unique and very tasty food for a really good price. Yes they don't take cash, but they don't make excuses, and never would I expect to be greeted with that paint-peeling ex-con death-stare. And whats with the gimmicky Western decor? Hole in the Wall? The closest reason Chuck Box could be categorized Hole in the Wall: I'm afraid to eat here because if I piss off Spatula Master-Burger Nazi, he'll probably grab that red hot grill and flip it over on top of me... you gotta be mildly afraid to eat at a Hole in the Wall...\n\nIn all seriousness though, there's no excuse to treat paying customers like they're wasting your time. Maybe people don't know how to react, or they think that somehow its cool to go to Chuck Box and get treated like a roach. \nOOOK? Whatever!
