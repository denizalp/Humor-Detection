I heart art\n+\nI heart wine\n+\nI heart being wined and dined =\n\nAll of theses things come to life at FABO!!!!\n\nFABO is by far one of the most unique and intriguing places I've ever had the pleasure of going. Located right off of Selwyn Ave in downtown Charlotte, FABO is right in the mix of it all. \n\nFABO offers a fun and relaxing environment for all of its guest. As you walk in the door you will be kindly greated by The Glass House attendant. The Glass House is FABO's inhouse wine and beer bar. It provides customers with a wide variety of tasty beverages that you can sample by the glass. Pricing for your delicious beverage of choice is affordable and well worth it. During my first visit to FABO, I had the pleasure of enjoying an impeccable glass of Riesling wine, a Kabinett, by Karl Kaspar. My tastebuds were very pleased with this mid-day pick me up, so sweet and delicious.\n\nOnce you've made your way past the The Glass House counters, you will find a decadent display of a countless cheeses, and baked goodies. These mouth watering treats are available all day everyday, and are sure to leave your tummy wanting more. During this trip I chose not to sample these tasty treats, instead I've chosen to experience these treats and the FABO coffee bar for a later study date.\n\nAnother pleasant surprise about FABO, is that it is surprisingly quiet and busy. Perhaps the hanging assortment of traveling art, mixed in with a class of wine or espresso creates this pleasant and thought-filled atmosphere.Giving me the comfort of home when I'm nestled up working in their one of a kind \"home-chairs,\" while simultaneously taking me into a whimsical place filled with countless styles of artwork. FABO provides a great change of pace that I'll be implementing into my regular routine. \n\nSo be on the look out for my FABO Review part II. And until then do yourself a favor and grab a handle of friends and make your way down to FABO asap, I promise you won't be disappointed.  =)
