Big Bowl is a choose-your-hand pulled-noodle joint.  The way it works is simple: \n1) choose the protein+broth, then \n2) choose the type of hand pulled noodle.  The noodle choices are: thin round, regular round, thick round, thin flat, regular flat and thick flat.  \n\nWe ordered three small bowls ($7.99).  They all looked nice aesthetically.  The amount of noodle was more than a normal small, leaning towards a medium.  I chose the regular round noodle.  The noodle was quite good and fresh.  The broth was clear.  I couldn't taste any MSG.  Either they used very little MSG, or they didn't use any.  It wasn't spicy, so you are safe here if you can't take much spiciness.  A jar of chili oil was on every table for those who craved spiciness.  The amount of protein and vegetable was quite generous.  It seemed to be more than Magic Noodle but less than Potato Noodle Soup of Bai.\n\nThe services was good.  The venue was clean.  The seating was comfortable.  The deal (price vs quality vs portion) was outstanding. \n\nWe missed the reverse side of the menu where the small plates and cold and hot appetizers are.  I would remedy the omission at the next visit.
