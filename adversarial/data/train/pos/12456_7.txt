Is kind of a cute idea, but a little claustrophobia inducing for me.  The place is located under Sip.  We had to call and put our name on the list.  Since it is so small, they have to wait for it to have openings to let you in.  Our wait was about 50 minutes, which was much longer than the time we spent there.  They have a few cocktails on the menu and that is the only thing they make, no changes.  Most have several liqueurs mixed, which was not appealing to me.  I ordered one that had only gin, it was very strong.  For me it felt like I was drinking jet fuel, super strong. I barely finished my drink and we moved on to another place.
