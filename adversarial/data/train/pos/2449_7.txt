I came in for brunch recently and the place was packed. Very happy to see a business thrive in our community but the reason why I'm rating it a 2 is because I was a bit turned off. \n\nWalked in and I smelt something a bit off in the outside waiting area. Came in & the hostess didn't acknowledge me... ok, she's busy. I stand in front of her for a moment but after awhile I decide to wait near the wall. People walk in after me and she gets their information before me. It's her job to know who's been waiting for help first. I go over to say something and another employee who clearly has had too many coffees just walks up and starts talking to her, interrupting me and cutting me off when I spoke. And it was to talk about another guests' sweater. Rude. \n\nI walk in the outside waiting area after learning how the long the wait is to inform my party and they were standing next to full trash cans. No wonder it smelled outside. I know it's busy and everything but full, smelly trash cans outside are not attractive to your guests. Decided we are going to bail and just get coffees. I go back inside to order and I'm yet again waiting forever for someone to acknowledge me near the coffee machine. A lady finally takes my order and I get 2 coffees for over $8. That's a bit much but when in Rome I thought. Our barista did a good job on the drinks, we enjoyed them.\n\nAs I wait, I take in my surroundings and the place is just dirty in my opinion. There are multiple people dealing with money then going behind the bar making mimosas, the counter is sticky, the cookies and what's left of the pastries are all uncovered in a very busy area where people are talking over the food constantly, my shoes were making a noise as if it were sticking to the floor. In combination on that and how it smelt outside, I won't be making a return here.
