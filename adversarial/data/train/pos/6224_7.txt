Boggles my mind why anyone would want their photo taken prior to gorging upon an Americanized international feast, but that's a feature of this buffet that you'll encounter while in line to pay. \n\nIf you've been to one off-Strip buffet, you've been to them all, except this one is massive. The majority of food is ordinary and predictable with unpeeled shrimp and deep fried everything with a dash of creamy pasta. My focus was on meat carving stations and Chinese food -- sushi rolls served in stainless steel trays didn't seem like a good idea. The prime rib and turkey were average. The Chinese pork and duck were tasty, except there was hardly any meat on the duck. I did like the Chinese broccoli, though. It was nice seeing pops of greenery among the buffet options. \n\nMany of the dessert choices were mediocre, and they totally had me with their faux \"red velvet\" cupcake. The fruit in the fruit pies of the sugar free section were pallid and looked unappetizing. \n\nThere's a discount for locals, but not on Saturdays. Thanks for the love, Rio. \n\nOur server was on top of it and cleared our table and refilled our beverages quickly. No complaints.\n\nCompared to other off-Strip buffets, this is one of the better ones; although, it charges Strip prices.
