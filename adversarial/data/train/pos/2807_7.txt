3 out of 3 Docs recommend Doc's Ice Cream! I've had Doc's bookmarked for the longest time and I was feeling like trying out a new dessert shop, so off we went for some delicious ice cream!\n\nI was actually going to make a reference to Doc Brown from Back to the Future but after reading an article on the business, the owner's name IS actually Doc Brown! Great Scott! Tbd if he has a flux capacitor or a Marty McFly though.\n\nThere's an interesting history on the business. Doc actually used to be a petroleum geologist for years, then was a policeman for the Phoenix Police Department until his retirement. The ice cream shop is his post-retirement family run business. Very cool!\n\nThe actual location is in the weirdest spot for an ice cream shop. It's in the middle of some commercial buildings with not a lot of good signage. We got to the complex through Beck Ave off of Warner. There isn't even an overhead sign saying Doc's on the building. You'll have to look for the AZ Sandwich sign.\n\nThe ice cream shares its space with aforementioned sandwich place. They had a good variety of flavors, including a unique lemongrass coconut. I ended up with a 2 scooper of banana gelato and lemon meringue in a large cup. The total was around $5.50. \n\nThe gelato itself was smooth, rich and creamy. I liked both flavors. The banana had a lot of fresh banana flavor and the lemon meringue had a light fresh lemon taste rather than tangy and tart. I loved the little bits of lemon creme cookie mixed in with the gelato.\n\nService was very friendly. The gentleman working here was very nice!\n\nThe only very minor criticism is that I'd like to have regular spoons instead of the tiny sample spoons to eat the big scoops of gelato with. I like to take the time to savor my food but it took a while to eat our delightful sweet treat!\n\nSo if you're craving ice cream, flock to Doc's! What are you waiting for, tick tock!
