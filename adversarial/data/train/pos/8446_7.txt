Pizza is fantastical, and inexpensive. \n\nThe wings weren't amazing, but they weren't as HORRENDOUS as the other review would have you believe (PRETTY sure the worst mistake you could have made was getting Pizza Hut wings dahn'a street)\n\nI was not a huge fan of the hoagie I ordered from Mia PIzza, however. They forgot to put mayo on it, and didn't give me the side of pickles that I asked for, which when noticed, turned me into the HULK AND I FREAKED OUT CAUSE I NEED PICKLES. \n\n\nFor a quick, tasty 'za, this place gets 3 stahz.
