Back to Tender for Restaurant Week, and another fine meal.  \n\nExcellent fresh Multigrain Bread with rich butter and good Sourdough dipped in fresh Pesto were nice complimentary openers.  Maine Lobster Bisque with Creamed Fresh Roasted Maine Lobster was silky smooth, with just a hint of a Sherry-like accent.  And a 10 oz. Certified Double R Ranch Angus Beef Ribeye Steak with Bell Pepper Sauce was perfectly medium rare as ordered.  The sauce,  a type I had never experienced before, tasted remarkably like Green Bell Pepper, and was very pleasant and complemented the beef quite well.  I just wished I had more of it to ladle over the melt-in-the-mouth meat.  But the Bearnaise Sauce ordered by Diane was so good it was drinkable, so my steak was not  suffering from any lack of sauce.\n\nBaked Potato Wedges were soft but surprisingly tasty --like giant, full-figured French Fries.  After a long break between the completion of our entrees and service of dessert, the final course, a Dessert Tasting Trio of Vanilla Bean Creme Brulee, Chocolate Souffle Cake, and New York Style Cheesecake, included a rather bitter Chocolate Souffle with Mango Pearls and Mango, but excellent Cheesecake and a very fine Creme Brulee.\n\nTwo waiters served us very proficiently throughout our dinner.  Our water glasses were regularly refilled, and the restaurant manager even paid us a call to see that our party of four was being taken care of properly.  We were made to feel welcome, and each of us enjoyed a very satisfying dinner.  \n\n4-1\/2 stars overall!
