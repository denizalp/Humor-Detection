HUGE portions. I could not finish my meal. At $8 one combo meal can feed a small army. \n\nI ordered the general tso's chicken combo(every combo includes fried rice, chicken lo mein, an egg roll and cream crab puffs), but since I ordered delivery I needed to order $12 worth of food. I added pepper steak with onions to reach a total of $18 after delivery. \n\nThe food was piping hot when I got it, however it was just okay. The general tso's chicken was average, the fried rice was lacking in eggs or any other stir fry veggies, but the lo mein was excellent as well as the egg rolls and cream crab puffs. The best dish was easily the pepper steak - excellent flavor, fresh peppers and onions, and tender steak- it was great. I'll definitely eat here again, but for now I need to overcome this food induced coma.
