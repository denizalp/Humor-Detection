After calling around for pricing, asking FB friends for recommendations, etc., I came here based on Yelp reviews.  Costco\/Mr. Lube doesn't need my money, so as someone who is self-employed, I prefer to patronise small businesses whenever possible!\n\n(Btw Costco doesn't pick-up their phone, but it's $50 INCLUDING filter change.  Wait is forever + an eternity.  Mr. Lube - and other quick-change places - is $50, nothing else included, and apparently you get to sit in your car while they change your oil at break-neck speeds.)\n\nPROS:\n-  taken right away without an appointment.  This will obviously vary based on your timing\n-  quick service that was done in 15-20mins\n-  waiting room was warm and there was a washroom, TV, electrical fireplace, fridge with drinks, & free WiFi!!!\n-  price - much, much cheaper than Costco\/Mr. Lube!\n-  owner, or so I assumed, was very friendly and seems very trustworthy\n-  windshield wiper fluid was topped up, breaks were checked, AND tires were pumped without asking\n\nCONS:\n-  just sorta far for me, but it's ok\n\nIt's something small, but I love the small details like nice waiting area, not to mention topping up fluid, checking breaks, and pumping tires.  These actions don't take long to do, but \"a little goes a long way\"!  \n\nThis was a very positive experience for such an annoying, but necessary errand.  Highly recommended!
