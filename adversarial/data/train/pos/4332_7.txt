Jake's... Well it was filling. It a small spot right off of Cheyenne and Loose. Myself and a friend went down because I saw it was new and had some good reviews so far. We walked in and started talking with the cook and his helper. They were really fun to talk to. We got some menus and ask a little advise on what to order. I got the BBQ pulled pork sandwich and my friend out the Super B. I order a side of the chili cheese fries and my friend or the coleslaw, which is a little spicy. I usually don't like slaw but i would order it from them. They also has a secret sauce which was what we said a spicier version of canes sauce, which is a compliment. They also have a homemade BBQ sauce but I wasn't the biggest fan. It was kinda watery. It fell right off my pork. They also didn't have any soda machine, just bottled drinks. While eating i saw another order being prepared, BEWARE. They are still working out kinks in their ordering system. They also couldn't split the check with cash and card. Overall it was average to me, might try some other items but they don't have much of a menu.
