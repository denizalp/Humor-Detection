I love the drive in experience. It allows me to be comfortable, watch brand new movies and not have to sit with others. Ugh, people. Am I right?\n\nBut also a great value at $12 for 2 movies. Even the concessions are well priced compared to a standard movie theatre. 2 drinks and a large popcorn for $15 is not bad at all. \n\nThe only thing I would change would be the bathrooms. Not pleasant, and I'd rather pop a squat between the cars. \n\nOverall, a great nostalgic experience. Please don't ever shut down 5 Drive In!
