Over a year ago, I was encouraged to try Four Seasons by their marketing manager who called herself the 'Tooth Fairy.' I showed up for my first introductory appointment and waited a full hour. Once in the chair, they explained that I would be there for about 90 minutes for the complete first-time exam. I let them do the x-rays, but I had to go back to work & reschedule my appointment because I did not plan on being there for 2.5 hours for a cleaning. \n\nI came back within the week for my cleaning and they took me on time. While I was in the chair, they asked me to sign some permission forms to do some deep cleaning on a few of my teeth. Each deep cleaning took about an extra minute or two. When I went to check out, my bill was over $400 ... FOR A CLEANING! \n\nCame back a week later for a filling and once again, I waited in the wait room for over an hour. Not only that, once I was in the chair, the doctor kept stopping to attend to other patients in the facility. With weeks, the filling fell out... twice. I had to come back twice to let him try to fix it. I finally went to another dentist and paid him to redo the filling. When I came in to get my records, the woman, whom I believe was an owner, couldn't understand why I wanted to leave. I felt like I was overcharged, I got shotty workmanship and that my time was not as valuable as the doctor's. \n\nFour Seasons is an extremely elegant looking office & has very nice amenities like a help-yourself coffee machine in the lobby, TVs while you get serviced and digital imaging for your teeth. You can even get a manicure or facial while you are there. This place is very high-end and, understandably, they have to cover their costs. I'm sure there are several happy Four Season patients. It's just a matter of personal preference.
