A tale from my most recent visit: I discovered one of the most heartbreaking things to see. The server brings your food out and there are no biscuits on the plates. What? Wait? Where are the flaky, yummy biscuits? It was as if the server could read our minds... he said, \"we have biscuits in the oven right now. We'll bring them out as soon as they're ready.\" Crisis averted. Let's move on.\n\nI love Dish. It almost feels like you're in a family member's kitchen. Cozy, welcoming. The only thing I don't like about it: they're closed on Sundays. \n\nI love the chicken and dumplings. Every bite feels like a hug. I've been hooked ever since I watched the triple D episode here. If it's good enough for Guy, then it's a must try. I'm also a big fan of the salmon cakes and collard greens. My friend Jason gets chicken fried steak without the gravy. Blasphemy. Pure blasphemy.\n\nBack to the biscuit situation... in the middle of our meal, here comes a plate of heaven. Warm, delicious biscuits. It was well worth the wait. Now if Jason wouldn't have been so selfish and ordered his gravy on the side... it would have been damn near perfection.\n\nThe workers are incredibly friendly. We are always well taken care of here and everyone is so nice. Parking can be a little tricky in this area. Come with patience. \n\nI'm looking forward to Spring and enjoying my biscuits on the patio.
