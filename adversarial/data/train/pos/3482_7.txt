Yes, the salted carmel brownies are tasty.  So are the eclairs and the all the petit something or others and macaroons.  Its a french bakery, that stuff is supposed to be good.\n\nLet's be honest, the place is popular because they are open 24 hours a day.  \n\nThe underage hipsters see it as a great place to all hang out and sit in the cushy little seating areas amongst the odd paint by numbers art and the victorian mish mash and talk about their twitter accounts, tight jeans, and shaggy haircuts without their parents thinking they are getting in trouble.\n\nFor the rest of us, its that awesome place to get that last edible nightcap after all the bars have stopped serving food or closed.  I yearn for a sausage egg and cheese croissant after a night of staying on the edge of the mosh pit at the Milestone.\n\nYes, I have been there during the light of day.  The wifi is a little slow, but it is a nice quiet joint if you need to plow through some work.
