Great experience. We walked in looking for some fun new shoes, and they were making popcorn right there inside the door. Had to get some of that while we shopped. It was buy one get one half off throughout the store. Yay!!! \n\nI found some 'Bobs'. So comfortable, and with each purchase Skechers makes a donation to help save the lives of dogs and cats. Way cool. I love stuff like that. \n\nMy husband found some really comfy shoes that he just had to have. We grabbed some socks...buy one get one half off also...and we were ready to check out.
