This is like the little Walmart that couldn't.  Correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe this use to be just a Walmart.  They have attempted to make it a Super Center.  What a horribly dumb idea.  If Hoarders were to do a show that concentrated on establishments, I'm fairly sure this location would be one such location.\n\nI literally walked around, and around, looking for an item that I passed several times.  Stupid me, I guess the logic of organization I have does not pertain to here.  \n\nPlus side here, the sinks work in the men's restroom finally.
