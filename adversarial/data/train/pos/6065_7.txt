I HAVE BEEN HERE 5 TIMES IN 6 DAYS!! WHAT THE EFF?!?!!\n\nIf any person, any thing, any place can keep me coming back almost everyday... he, she, it, definitely deserves 5 stars! So GLORY HOLE DOUGHNUTS, YOU GET MY 5 STARS and ALSO MY HEART! :)\n\nBefore you think I'm an enormous pig, let me correct you now... I'm just a little pig (I'm only 4 feet, 11 & 3\/4 inches in height). Ha! Plus I LOVE TO SHARE! My favourite part of my day, is when I watch someone take their first bite into a Glory Hole Doughnut... the pure joy I see in their eyes, the orgasmic expressions I see on their faces... and I know IT'S ALL MY FAULT that they feel SOOO GOOOOD! So thank you Glory Hole for taking our taste buds on a euphoric high and making everyone I share the wealth with love me for it! \n\nNuts always so fresh & delicious! Staff so pleasant and friendly! Glory Hole Doughnuts, keep up the great work! Thank you for making my stomach and my friends and family so happy! I'm not lying when I say, \"I LOVE YOU!\" (I can't even remember the last time I've said those words...)
