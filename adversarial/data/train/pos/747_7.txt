I had not gone here in at least 5 years,\nI remember the only decent thing being Lahori Fish.\nI also remember the waiter the last time telling us the Butter Chicken was not good and to go to an Indian restaurant if we wanted that.\n\nI went with 2 Pakistani friends, a little apprehensive since I've lived over 25 years and Parc Extension and I know Greek and South Asian spots here like the back of my hand.\n\nMy friend assured me it was great the last time he went, so off we went.\n\nThis used to be a Greek restaurant a while back and they kept the nautical decor, What bugs me every time is we are not allowed near the window, it's practically segregated for families only (ie. women and children) and man stay closer to the kitchen.\n\nThe food was just bland and not fresh, every dish disappointed, the chicken karahi was full of bones and the sauce separated from the oil (re-heated).\n\nThe lamb byriani was also underwhelming with the meat chunks dry and chewy.\n\nA lentil dish was practically untouched, the naan with raita was quite good.\nThe waiter just shrugged  when we told him the best thing was the bread.\n\nAbout 50 bucks for 3 dishes and 6 naan's (we were starving and it was the only good thing). The prices are a bit higher than elsewhere (they are hidden away on the second floor, there for many years so their rent must be cheaper).
