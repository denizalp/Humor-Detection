If I can rate this place zero stars, then I will and can.\n\nThere are a bunch of sales people on the strip giving away \"VIP Passes\". These are a waste of time. All it does is put you in a shorter line that moves slower than the general admission line. If you think about it, general admission are all paying customers so they would rather let the $$ in. And the \"VIP\" line sits & waits. Boo!!\n\nThe crowd was like this....\"Douche Bag\/Sausage Fest\" central. And this goes for the guys & girls. Luckily, the Fashion Police wasn't there because a lot of people will be going to Fashion Jail. Wait, I wont be so mean...I guess the hotels that they were staying in didnt have any mirrors.  LOL.\n\nThere was a lot of people in there fronting like the know this music. That was funny.\n\n And of course you have the \"Woo!\" girls. They were funny. Any time a Top 40 song came on...guess what? \"Woo!\" \n\nIn my opinion, this is a club to definitely pass up. I will say this because we went to XS the night before & that is how a club should be.\n\n\nOn a side note, Is it me or does Vegas DJ suck? Sorry Vegas DJ's you have to keep the club moving. Thank you Bay Area DJ's for setting the standard.
