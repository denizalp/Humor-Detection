I don't understand how anyone likes the coffee here. They claim to be the best. I found the coffee luke warm and weak. Now, it was so weak, that I had them put a shot of espresso in it. Nothing could bring this coffee back to life. \n\nI am into coffee...big time. I have been drinking coffee from all over the USA since the 1970s. It has to be bold and fresh. I've been here a few times. I like the atmosphere, though it's mostly students hanging out. Still, it's pretty funky, and I wanted to love it here. the servers were nice enough. It's just that the coffee was TERRIBLE. Please, whoever owns this place, train your staff to make consistent coffee that is bold. From the three times I've been here, in different months, all three cups of your boldest coffee tasted WEAK! I don't know how to express this more. I will check you guys out again and see if there is improvement, but quite frankly, I don't see that happening. This is sad to me, because I want to love it here.
