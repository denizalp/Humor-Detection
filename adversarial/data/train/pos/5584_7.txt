Sex In The City meets World of Warcraft.\n\nThis dark, sexy place is unlike most establishments you might find in the Scottsdale area, which I not only appreciate, but encourage. It's a bit off the beaten path as the entrance is in the back and when you walk in, your pupils will needs time to adjust in order to navigate.\n\nThe wine selection was impressive and the hummus plate was perfect. The staff was great. When my best friend realized she really wasn't a fan of the wine we chose, she was able to trade out for a different one with no difficulty or attitude whatsoever.\n\nThe DJ was spinning very relax-esque music with a little bit of funk. It was a nice change of pace from the typical top 40 you'd hear elsewhere. As the night progressed, the beats got sexier and the songs more clever. I was completely sold when he remixed Johnny Cash & some dub step. \n\nOf course we didn't come out of there completely unscathed. We had to visually endure a cougar (or two) throwing themselves all over their sugar daddies in a blatant gold-digging escapade for all to see. But I guess that's the price you pay to party in Scottsdale.\n\nIt's a great bar and I would recommend it to anyone!
