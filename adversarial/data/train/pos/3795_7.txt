I think they were going through some remodeling when I went because the seating area looked like it needed some TLC and they didn't have ice water so I had to purchase bottled water. At Yanni's, you order at the register, pay, and then they bring out your food. \n\nI had the gyro Greek salad and was not impressed at all. Usually, I love these at any Greek or Mediterranean restaurant but here the gyro meat was way too oily and the greens were kind old old looking and super bitter. It seems like they get really good reviews so I will give them another chance. My salad also came with grilled pita bread. I though it was funny that the only hot sauce they had was Asian Chili sauce... Lol \n\nThe service was great... The cashier was very friendly and kept checking up on me and so did the owner\/chef.
