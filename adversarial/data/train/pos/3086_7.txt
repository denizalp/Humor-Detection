Oh man, Hyde at the Bellagio. I had high expectations for this place, but I was quickly let down within a few hours of being here. My friend got us in for free using his Las Vegas app. Apparently, you play a few games and accumulate points which then you can cash in for various prizes.\n\nClub\nLocated in the Bellagio. It's a very tiny club. It's sooo packed you can barley walk around. The music is blah. What made the night was our bartenders. Exciting, talkative, and friendly.\n\nSecurity\nVery rude. The GM was a tool. Absolutely the type of guy to puff his chest to show dominance. I didn't get his attitude. \n\nFinal thoughts, pass on this place. Vegas has much more to offer than this.
