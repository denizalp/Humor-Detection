The Zuni Grill is the in-house restaurant at the Hilton Phoenix \/ Mesa.  I had an extended stay (over two weeks) at the above noted Hotel and being a Hilton preferred partner we were given complimentary breakfast buffet tickets.\n\nWe were very underwhelmed with the breakfast buffet and after one-two attempts; thereafter we all went out and got breakfast from other places. The muffins were not moist and the fruit in them was sparse if at all noticeable; and the fajita station options were rather limited but the fresh fruit was plentiful. If one is not given complementary passes and has to pay the full $14.95 for the breakfast buffet I would definitely suggest passing and go for one of the local options nearby and outside of this hotel.\n\nI never tried Zuni Grill for room service or dinner and those experiences never happened because of the underwhelming breakfast buffet. I was really taken aback with this Hilton and the quality of the hotel may result in the quality of the on-site restaurant. Be mindful of that and have a plan B just in case you're not satisfied or you really want something enjoyable.
