Visit every time we're in Vegas now.  THE place for meat eaters.  I mean SERIOUS meat eaters.  They have a really great salad bar too if that's your thing. I make sure to come here hungry.  I grab a big heap of their Jasmine rice, topped with their onion\/cilantro\/lemon juice mix and then keep the meat coming.  My favorite is the Picanha steak.  Once I'm done, I roll my happy arse out the door.\n\nServer Tip: Ask for David if you can.  He's a hoot and very attentive.
