The Shamrock is one of the best bars in the Cleveland area. This is the type of place you can go into pissed off and leave in a little bit better of a mood. The lighting is nice. The bartenders are cool people. It is a local crowd, well usually it is not a crowd at all, just a couple of patrons scattered around the bar. I started going here as a young man, felt like there weren't any girls ever going there, so I went to other places.
