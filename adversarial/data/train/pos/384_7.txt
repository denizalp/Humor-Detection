Nothing says awesome more than one dollar cookie.  Especially when that cookie is as big as your head.\n\nWhen you're looking to eat cheap.  When you're looking for an AMAZING meal.  When you're looking for something on South Campus, even if you're NOT a student, head to Bevier Cafe.  You've never had a dorm food experience like it, I promise you.\n\nThe only reason this place loses a star is because... despite it's upscale menu and the quality of the food they put out, it _is_ still a dorm cafe.  There's not much to be done for a building that was built in the fifties, so you eat in a place that consistently reminds you of that office setting in Joe vs the Volcano, but still.  You'll never eat better!
