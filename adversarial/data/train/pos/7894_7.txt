So spur of the moment, we decided to just do a staycation here on a Sunday. \n\nThe price was very reasonable for the room that we got. I really liked the room. The bathroom was nice and the bed was very comfy. We had our dogs with us so I'm glad that the hotel was dog friendly. The downside for me was that I wish they would've given us a room maybe on the first floor. With two dogs, being on the third or fourth floor, it was very inconvenient for us every time we had to take them out to the bathroom. Especially if it was in the middle of the night. Also, we ordered room service. About 30 minutes or so passed and we were still waiting for our food. When we called them, they forgot what our order was. 1. why wouldn't you have written it down. and 2. why wouldn't you call us back and ask us what our order was instead of having us wait. However, to make up for it, we ended up getting our order for free. \n\nThe other downside was that their parking lot is extremely small, so if you can't find parking, you will have to look for street parking. Other than this, I liked the room we got.
