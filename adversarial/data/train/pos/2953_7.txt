You know why it's called Wet Bar?  \nBecause the place looks like a big washroom with piss all over the floor.\n\nForget about Suite 106, it's never open...at least when I've visited there.  \nYou enter this multi-level complex, walk up to the top floor where it's the only place where there is anyone to be found, step on somebody else's bodily discharge, and walk to where your booth is.  The selling point is that there are white blinds at the VIP areas.  Brightly lit with amber lights, the blinds hides you from the wall which it is set against.  In case the Government is spying on you with XRAY technology, at least there are these blinds.\nWhen was the last time these blinds were cleaned?  I saw spider webs, spider eggs...just a infestation of arachnid colonising the bottle service space.  If I made this privy to the women there, they'd be screaming and jumping all over the place.  But what's the point?  They're screaming and jumping all over the place already.\n\nThe music SUCKS.  Despite the open rooftop, the place is a furnace, and the tropical looking blinds adds psychological heat.  Oh it's nearly unbearable, makes me wish I wore a slooty dress like the women here.  \nThe client√®le is hostile, the only friendly looks you'll get are from the girls with the World's least unconvincing lashes waiting for you to buy them drinks.  \nThe price for drinks was the only tolerable aspect, as my usual ran only $6, whereas it could go as high as $22 at Yorkville.  \n\nA mess of a place, needs some serious housekeeping.  \n\nMusic is dull, bottle service unremarkable and disengaging, women here just sit in their seats as if this were a big drunken picnic, cheap drinks and that's about it.\nEveryone who posts photos of themselves here have the blinds as background.  YOU CAN BUY BLINDS AT HOME DEPOT YOU KNOW.\n\n\nIf anyone actually gets to experience Suite 106 let me know.\nLeave your nice shoes at home.
