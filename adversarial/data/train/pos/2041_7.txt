Suddenly after all these years shopping at this place , a  cashier that we have been served by and knows us says . \"Your wife has to wait till the purchase is paid for before she leaves\" her new blue hair must have affected her customer service. I can't believe the rudeness she displayed. We have shopped here since it opened !! This cashier knows us too. I was in shock.\nProducts 8\/10 service 1\/10 smarten up Longos!!
