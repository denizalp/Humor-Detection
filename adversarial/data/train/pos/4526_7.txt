Yunnan Cross Bridge Rice Noodle is a fun place to eat especially when your friend trying to share a folklore with you while you go yay yay yay with noodles and corn pancakes stuck full in your mouth.\n\nThe soup based is really light chicken broth, just have a hint of favour. I restained myself from adding any hot chilli oil in order to taste the dish the way it is. The meat that comes with it does not make me feel too excited though.... I can just skip that.\n\nThe corn pancake ($1.99) is nice for dessert. I just like corn and pancakes so a winning combination for me.. and of course for $1.99 I am happy!\n\nCash Only!
