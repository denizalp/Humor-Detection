I hit this once and a while when i wana feel gross about myself..lol.  Romanburgers are the SH*T though.. Its like every other M.H. except it has a drive through..laziest thing ive ever seen.  Food quality is not as good as when i was a kid.  This one takes phone orders and coupons w no problem.  Get food right most of the time.  NO FRICKIN ONIONS!!  ;)  For anyone from out of town...try a Roman...it  will change your life! ;)
