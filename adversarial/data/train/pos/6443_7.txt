Super friendly service and you can't beat $6.99 Prime Rib Dinner - available starting at 4:30 PM.  It's not Lawry's quality but it's damn tasty, especially for the price.  Located inside the Gold Spike Casino - they have 2 parking lots on both sides of the Casino.  Not worth gambling here (payout for slots aren't through the machine you have to waive over an old dude to get your money) but you can park, eat and then walk couple streets over to Fremont Street for some Old Town fun.\n\nI have no clue how good the casino hotel is at Gold Spike but residents get free breakfast everyday at the cafe (pre-designated breakfast meal per day) - they have a table ad with the info inside the cafe.
