For a variety of reasons, I've been a fan of David Chang for quite a while now.  Not the least of which, quite simply...his restaurants\/eateries are just good.  Granted, this is based entirely on the two spots of his in NY that I've been to (Ssam Bar and Milkbar), but there wasn't much about either experience I didn't like.  So, clearly, after seeing that one of my favorite restaurateurs had taken up shop in one of my favorite hotels in Vegas, it was only a question as to WHEN I'd stop in to check them out!\n\nWhile I've yet to visit most of their sister locations, I imagine that this Momofuku outpost is on the trendier side.  Which makes sense, give their home (Cosmopolitan).  The front \"bar\" area has a more of a casual look, but the main dining room in the back is nicer, with large windows to take advantage of its perch overlooking The Strip.  More importantly, the (lunch) menu, though not extensive, looked just as good - starters, buns, noodles, sides...just about everything looked delicious!\n\n**Note: besides how the menu is different for lunch\/dinner\/afternoon\/late night, the range of offerings changes often\/daily, so it's very likely that what I had won't be on the menu when you come here.\n\n-- GINGER SCALLION NOODLES with Pickled Shiitake, Cucumber, and Wakame...$15\nUnmixed: (https:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/momofuku-las-vegas-las-vegas?select=B23zSjMubR0dOOuugfA6_Q)\nMixed: (https:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/momofuku-las-vegas-las-vegas?select=DmJ32I9OmJzN2xzI7FO21w)\nIt may not have sounded very interesting, but this was great!  The fact it was served cold was unexpected, but it made sense given the flavors - slightly salty, earthy, and acidic.  The cucumbers added a nice crispness and the noodles had just the right bite to them!  Delicious!\n\n-- CRISPY POTATOES with Truffle Tofu and Parmesan...$12\n(https:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/momofuku-las-vegas-las-vegas?select=2rDrbHuSoZiNy0lHLGRAgg)\nI was actually pretty hopeful for this one, but it missed the mark.  While I liked the truffle flavor and the Parmesan (who wouldn't?), the potatoes didn't do it for me - kind of bland on their own and not the least bit crispy.\n\n-- PORK BELLY BUNS with Hoisin Sauce, Scallion, Cucumber...$7\n(https:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/momofuku-las-vegas-las-vegas?select=oVqsueDTysos7YQDoB6P6w)\nThough not quite as good as the one at Ssam Bar, this was still pretty solid.  It was a little dry as a whole, as there wasn't much sauce and part of the pork was dry (surprising, since it's pork belly), but everything else was good - the pork wasn't super fatty, the bun was decently soft, and the overall taste was good.\n\n-- SHOYU PORK RAMEN with Pork Belly & Shoulder and Slow Poached Egg...$17\n(https:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/momofuku-las-vegas-las-vegas?select=kNfm7ssIl0zAmaVjZdrlaQ)\nI wanted this as soon as I read it on the menu, but I got even more stoked when I saw this come out!  The pork belly (so thick!), the pork shoulder, the egg, the noodles, the broth (so rich!)...everything was perfect.  Even the sprouts were good!  I would totally come back just for this.\n\nBeyond the food, I'd be remiss not to mention the service here - from the hostess to the variety of servers that stopped by our table, everyone here was super friendly and accommodating.  At the end of the day though, it's all about the food and Momofuku was straight up delicious.  As bummed as I was to miss out on their noodle spot when I was in NY, I was just as elated to have corrected that here...and that it was so good!\n\nGiven how their dinner menu offers an entirely different slate of things to try (including a lot of large\/family-style dishes), I'll undoubtedly come back to try that.  But even if it's just for lunch, afternoon snack, or late night eats, or even for just a ramen craving though, you can bet I'd come back just for that shoyu pork ramen!
