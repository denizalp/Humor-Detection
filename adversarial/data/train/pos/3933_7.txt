Meh is the perfect summation for my dinner from this place.  If it weren't for an online voucher granting me $40 worth of food for $20 I doubt I would have ever heard of this place let along ordered from them.  The voucher promised free delivery so it was too good to pass up, though it turns out that it was also too good to be true since we were charged for said 'included' delivery.  But nevermind that, I know that gas and employees cost money so I moved past the surcharge to focus on the food.\n\nI started with a tom yum mushroom soup, which I ordered large to share with my partner but my guess is that they only have one size of soup container because I think we barely received 12oz of soup; it tasted alright but was nothing to write a glowing review about.  Entree sizes on the other hand were quite large but unfortunately fell into the well known quantity-over-quality trap.  My vegetarian pad thai had been adulterated by the ketchup short-cut reminiscent of fast food.  One of my dinner companions order the Monsoon, seafood fried rice, which appeared to simply be steamed rice without any additional seasonings and reportedly tasted as bland as it looked.  \n\nIn the end we were full of mediocre food, but full nonetheless.
