I asked if it had tomatoes. I said I was allergic to tomatoes. They said there are no tomatoes on that sandwich. Do I want tomatoes? I said no, please, no tomatoes. I get the sandwich, there are two tomatoes on there. So they put tomatoes on a sandwich that doesn't get tomatoes after we talked about how I can't have tomatoes. \n\nI'm hungry.
