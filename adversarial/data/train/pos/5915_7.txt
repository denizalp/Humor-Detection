I dare say you'll have a jolly good time if you pop into the Jolly Goods Candy Stop, because I know I did! \nThe woman that owns the shop is really friendly and informative. Before talking to her, I had no idea that the Queen of England had so much to do with British candy. In fact, you can verify the authenticity of British candy by looking for the Queen's Royal Insignia on the packaging. And hey, if it's good enough for the Queen of England, it's good enough for me! \nThe imported candy doesn't have the same amount of preservatives as North American candy typically does, meaning it has an expiration date. Which is comforting, considering we consume it, and all. \nBesides the bountiful selection of candy and chocolate, the Jolly Goods Candy Stop also has an ice cream counter. The owner was hard at work mashing up British Cadbury chocolate fingers to add to one of the ice creams while we chatted. \nAs well, there's also a modest selection of savoury items - bacon, traditional Scottish meat pies, and a selection of McCoy's Man Crisps. If any of you remember O'Ryan's Sour Cream & Onion Chips, they're just like that! There are tons of uniquely British flavours, too, like curry and chili prawn. \nSo, whether you're craving sweets from your homeland, or you'd just like to try what candy they eat across the pond, give Jolly Goods a try. The Queen's on the money!
