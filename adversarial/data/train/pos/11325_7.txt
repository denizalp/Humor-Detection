Absolute disaster.   It was not that busy, people waiting and standing for anyone to not only greet but to be seated as well.  Food is good but not worth the horrible service.  It felt like only one person was working even though I saw a full staff.  This is my last time.  Save yourself the trouble and eat across the street at Twin Peaks.
