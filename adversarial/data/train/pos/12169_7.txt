Take Two!\nThere is a running joke with my friends, sometimes when my husband comes along he will graciously pay for lunch, cocktails or movies, so they jokingly refer to him as \"the wallet\", so today at Atherton, I brought the wallet with me!!!  Yay!!!!  I bought fresh pickled jalapenos, squash, onions, pimento cheese and potatoes!!!  I didn't have to limit myself to one $5 item like last visit!!!   If you like jalapenos, you have to buy some from the pickle man.  The pimento cheese from Beverly's Gourmet Foods was super yummy too!!!  I love this place.  I might even have to change my current crush to Atherton Mill and Market.  Sorry Jed Steele Lake County Cabernet.  I take that back, I still have my crush on Jed.
