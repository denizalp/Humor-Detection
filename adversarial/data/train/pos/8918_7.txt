For those looking for a decent teriyaki place, this is it.\n\nSkip all the fast food places that surround this place. These guys are kind of hidden in the back. But once you find it, your taste buds and stomach will thank you later. For those that are familiar with Flame Broiler in So Cal, these guys are pretty similar.\n\nWhat I got was the #11 Chicken and Beef Combo Plate with Vegetables and Brown Rice. Right away I am liking the fact that they don't charge you extra for the brown rice. The vegetables, which they give you good portions of, are consisted of broccoli, cabbage, and sliced carrots. \n\nThe teriyaki sauce they have there are in big squeeze bottles. They also have sriracha for you spice heads. They have many other choices besides chicken and beef like short ribs, fish, tempura, miso soup, and California rolls.\n\n\nPrices are a bit cheaper than Teriyaki Madness and their customer service is very good.\n\nToo bad this is the only location they have because I live over by Aliante and this is kind of a drive for me so im jealous of those that work and\/or live around this area.
