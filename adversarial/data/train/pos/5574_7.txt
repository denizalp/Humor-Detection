DISCLAIMER: I don't like Walmart. Period. It would be a cold day in hell if I actually gave a Walmart a 5 star review. \n\nI only go to Walmart because they carry a brand of shampoo and conditioner that my preferred shopping spot does not carry. Well, they are supposed to carry it. The first time I went, they did. The second time, they only had the shampoo. Seems pretty typical of Walmart though, they carry things but that doesn't necessarily mean they have them in stock...\n\nStaff seems to only do the bare miniumum, probably because that's what they are paid (how do you think Walmart keeps those prices so low??) You practically need to tackle someone to get assistance. The man that works in the gun department is the only Walmart employee I have dealt with that didn't make me want to walk right out. Someone give that man a raise! \n\nOh, and the parking lot sucks too.
