Papa Razzini's is a great little family owned neighborhood Italian restaurant.\n\nThey start you out with some warm bread and a bowl of tasty bruschetta. This is one of the best \"free\" appetizers that you could get at any restaurant. Love it!\n\nTheir salads are pretty good, but the dressings are a bit thick. Due to this, we opted to go for an oil & vinegar dressing topping instead.\n\nFor the main course, I can emphatically recommend the Bird's nest dish. I absolutely love it. Angel hair pasta with garlic, basil and olive oil goodness. I don't know what they do, but they make it sooo delicious.\n\nWe love stopping in at this spot when we're out on the East side of town.
