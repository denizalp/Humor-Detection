When someone describes the premise behind Ethiopian food, I'll admit it's a tough sell. Cold squishy flat bread you use to scoop up lentils - but I gotta tell you, it's amazing. \n\nI was there for my second time last week and was yet again impressed with the great food, fragrant aromas and rich atmosphere. The food is packed with unique flavours and from minute you walk in you really feel like your experiencing something totally different, but never in a forced or touristy way. \n\nThe two standouts on the menu for me are the Tibs (beef cooked in chillies and spices) and the coffee - If you're a fan of dark roast, you absolutely must try theirs. You'll need to order it at the start of your meal as it takes about 30 minutes for them to roast the beans (can you say fresh?). \n\nIt's a small place, with an extremely laid-back atmosphere, so if you're in a rush or expecting a waiter to dote on you, chances are you'll be disappointed. On the other hand, if you're looking for a full dining experience and want to soak it all up, this is your place.
