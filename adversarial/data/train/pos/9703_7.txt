Me and my 4 year old daughter went here for the first time for our mani and pedi service. The staff who worked here are nice, I can say they dont talk too much but you can see they are trying to show they want you to be fine and satisfied. But their nail polishes are old i might say, me and my daughter went to shower after 3 hours and nail polishes went off in our nails.... i was just whaaattt?! I wasted 60 for nail service
