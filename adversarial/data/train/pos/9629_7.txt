I stayed at the Windsor Arms for two nights.  I was disappointed overall.  I expected a very high level of service and amenities.  While the staff was very friendly and attentive, there were just a number of issues that detracted from my enjoyment.  First, you're paying a pretty high price so things should be excellent.  The good:  clean, large room and staff who seem to care.  The bad:  Bed was OK but far less comfortable than the bed I had at a Marriott in NYC recently.  It should be far more comfortable.  Toilet paper belongs in a cottage with a fussy septic system.  Like newspaper!  Breakfast service was very spotty and food (I had lunch one day) was barely adequate.  Once upon a time this place was a \"go-to\" foodie location - what happened?  Newspapers (3 of them!) were much appreciated but not delivered until well after 8:30 am - I would imagine the business guests are long gone before their newspapers are delivered.  The bar is dreadful.  Terrible decor, empty (one other customer) and just depressing.  I have always wanted to stay here - once, in the early '70's, I literally ran into Katherine Hepburn as she exited this hotel.  I really thought I'd love it but it seems like it is under occupied and trying too hard without really succeeding.
