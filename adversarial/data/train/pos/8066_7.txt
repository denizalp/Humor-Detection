Oh. My. God.  Seriously.  It's that good.  I have been wanting to try this place for years and realize that 1. they do take out and 2. they deliver to me via GrubHub.  Yes, delivery.  I might gain 300 pounds, but it will be worth it. \n\nWe ordered a bunch of different things and each was better than the next.  First, we got the chicken and chips for my daughter.  For five bucks, you get 3 huge chicken strips and a ton! of fries.  They were perfectly cooked and even still good by the time we got them.  Amazing. \n\nThen, I got the scotch bap.  The bap - the bread - was perfect - floaty and heavenly.  The scotch egg was awesome - good tasting sausage and a perfectly hardboiled egg.  It came with cheddar, spring greens and a great mustard.\n\nZ got the chicken tikka masala pie - but what he actually got was one of the steak ones. Normally that would cause me to ding a star, but it was super delicious that he didn't even mind.  The crust - omg, the crust.  Amazing.  Buttery and flakey and obviously made with lard and heart.  He also got the fish bap which was awesome and the tartar sauce is on point. \n\nI will be going again.  And again.  And again.
