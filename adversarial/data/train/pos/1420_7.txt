Honestly, I can't believe that this place is still open with all the changes Planet Hollywood has gone through. The service is consistent and friendly but no enthusiasm. The menu is dated and even on the strip seemed expensive for a plate of pasta. \n\nI had an appetizer which was something in italian that I could not pronounce so therefore I felt stupid ordering it but besides a salad it seemed to be the most relatively healthy dish. It was an eggplant with ricotta and a marinara sauce. Well the eggplant was sliced SUPER thin, I mean there was barely any there, it was battered and fried and rolled around ricotta, with marinara sauce served on top. The flavor was decent but you should have to try to mess that combination up. However, I spent $15 on ricotta cheese. Blah! The BF had Chicken Fettuccine Alfredo, it was bland and not a good alfredo sauce. I'm not rushing to get back to this place. \n\nI wouldn't not have picked this place but the out of town friends were flying by the seat of their pants. Man those non planners!
