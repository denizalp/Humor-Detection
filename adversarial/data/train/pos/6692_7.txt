I Had Such a Great Experience to say the \"least\" at High Noon Tattoo. Great work, great vibe and great Artists! Jason Pendergraph has done all my work and I'm  Obsessed with them. And it doesn't hurt to get Tattoo'd by a Freakn Fine Piece of Ass. He is so Hot I had a hard time keeping my shirt on!!!! if I had a reason to get a tattoo and see him everyday w\/ out looking like a stalker I would!! I'd be at that front door with my tounge out like I was while getting Tattoo'd. He's the one with the Hot Voice and Gold tooth. Don't waste ur time looking for other tattoo shops. High Noon with satisfy you in every way. Xo
