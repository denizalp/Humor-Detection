Quite an open airport with easy to read signs as you step off the plane. The area is going under some renovations, but still remained cleaned and organized. The gates to each terminal are close together with decent seating areas, so that made it easy to mosey  around without having to worry about jogging across the airport to make it to your gate.\n\nThe food court options are Burger King, Auntie Anne's Pretzels, Papa John's Pizza, and Salsaita. There are some sit down restaurants, but some do not serve the lunch menu until after 10:30 a.m., so check before being seated. I ended up eating a personal size pepperoni pizza at Papa John's as it looked the freshest out of all of the other options. The pizza was hot and pretty tasty. The crust was a bit thinner than the usual Papa John's I've had in the past, but it was good and I didn't get sick before I boarded on my next flight. Score! \n\nOverall, clean and organized airport even during renovations. Restrooms were bright and sanitary. The workers there (from maintenance to check stands) were cheerful, said hello, and I think were geniunaly friendly.  It was a pleasant experience at this Charlotte airport.
