I have been known to have toast for breakfast, so I have no problem eating at a place called Toast - or Famous Toastery for that matter. While the servers are generally attentive, the promise of the place falls squarely between that of toast and something famous.\n\nTo start with, we were there on a day when things were a bit windy, and though it was nice enough outside to sit on the patio, the way the umbrellas were arranged\/installed\/whatever wasn't particularly up-to-snuff, so every time a bit of wind came by, it actually caught them like a sail, and they took off, ready to spear anyone not paying attention. Made things interesting, to say the least. While those attentive servers were nice, they didn't seem particularly interested in much other than plopping the umbrellas back in the hole, ready for another round later. Ah well.\n\nWe did survive our meal, and it was a sold effort - but one you can find in a reasonable number of places around, something more than fast food breakfast (something that is being offered in more and more places these days), and perhaps on par with other sit-down, diner-type places. If you're in the area, it's probably worth a visit to see if things have improved. Just watch out for the flying umbrellas if you're seated outside on a windy day.
