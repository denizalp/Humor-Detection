This review is specific to the pharmacy. I have had several issues with the female pharmacist. She seems to get great pleasure in frustrating customers with their long wait time or inability to fill a prescription. \nCVS has a drive thru which would make it convenient but after the terrible customer service I refuse to go there anymore.
