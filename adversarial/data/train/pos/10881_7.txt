Serious good times. They mean business... but you will pay.\n\n1) DJ's - main room dj was fantastic. Good mix of Top 40\/Hip Hop\/Rock. He kept the vibe going all night. Hip Hop room was small but really jam packed. Lots of hips ;) Dance room, not as many people but the DJ was super nice. Our tables were in this room so we spent some time there hanging out and enjoying ourselves.\n2) Tables - I now can no longer go to a Vegas club without reserving a table. No wait for our group of 18. We were ushered in as soon as we arrived, the bouncers were so sweet and we had a personal bartender who poured mixed drinks for us at our table. \n3) Drinks - When we finally ran out of Vodka at our tables, I started getting drinks at the bar. I'm not sure if it was me or the bartender, but I ordered a Vodka Red Bull and got a lovely pour. So lovely, in fact, that I think that was the drink that put me in that oh so happy place where I didn't want to stop dancing all night long. \n4) Space - The space was beautiful. The main room is huge. Yes, there are stripper poles and they were WELL utilized. There were lots of nice crevices where you could hide away and fantastic bar space. I never had to wait for a drink and the place was packed. \n\nAll in all, I would recommend this place, but only if you don't have to wait in line. You'll be there for at least 2 hours and by then your poor footsies will be ready to be free of those stripper heels you bought just for Vegas. Sorry ladies.
