They've changed their pricing structure for the better ($3\/1, $5\/2, $7\/3). I recommend buying 3 - I promise you won't think \"man this was a bad idea\", unless you eat like a bird! $7 for a delicious, unique lunch. I can handle that ! \n\nNow that I've tried a few, my favorite is the pulled pork! I'm going to go out on a limb and say it's the best pulled pork sammie I've had in the city of Las Vegas! I had one yesterday and I'm already hitting refresh on the slidinthru website to see where I can buy another today. MMM\n\nAfter pulled pork, my next favorite is kalbi, followed by pep pep. Barbie and caprese are good, but not top 3 material ! \n\nProps again to the owner for bringing fun food to Las Vegas! I'd love to see some new items in the future - as long as he doesn't take away my pulled porkie !
