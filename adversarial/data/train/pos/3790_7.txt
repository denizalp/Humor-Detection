This place was a bad decision we made on the night we got here. My wife and I had been flying all day and were hungry and this was all that was open, we were seated next to a fountain that made us wet the entire time. Our waiter was garbage and took over an hour from the time we sat down until we had food.\n\nOnly about 10 people were there so it wasn't busy. Should have taken it as a sign. Anyway we finally got our food and it had been sitting under heat lamps for a while as everything was dry and cold. Thanks to our garbage waiter our experience was atrocious. \n\nI understand this place is aimed at children, but if you are charging the same price as a five star restaurant you're shit better be in a row. Don't eat here go anywhere else.
