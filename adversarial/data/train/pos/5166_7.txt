The worst experience I ever had among resturants.\nEven 1 star is too much.\nWorst customer service and dirty environment.\nEven they didn't fix the broken peel infront of the shop and when I noticed about it, they didn't applogize.\nIt was very dangerous for my kid when he was playnig around.\nVery rude staff.\nAs a persian I am ashamed.
