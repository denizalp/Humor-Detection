I like this location better than the one in Old Town, which is the only other location I've been to. It's a pretty small restaurant, but they also have a small private room in the back for gatherings. \n\nThe ingredients all taste fresh and if you sit at a high top in the bar area you can watch them make the pizza. I love watching the prep! We  actually forgot our leftovers after our last visit and one of the waiters came out to give them to us. So nice!\n\nIf you're lucky you may find parallel parking spot right out front, but there's also more parking in a big lot just to the west of the restaurant. And the best part is you can walk off your meal by strolling around the shops.
