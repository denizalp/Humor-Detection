Another FTR? I can't resist.\n\nYes it's Ross. You can Dress For Less, or so the slogan goes. For me, their stores never seem to have what I need when I need it. I guess it's a seasonal thing. Still, it's a great place to pick up cheap clothing. I've also shopped there for luggage and random home goods. This particular store is in a great location too. It's right by Michael's, Bed Bath & Beyond, and Marshall's.
