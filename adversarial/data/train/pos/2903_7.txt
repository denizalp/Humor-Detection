Lovely park with loads of space to enjoy a picnic,a stroll or a small bike ride. They have a dog park for puppies to frolic. Nice playground for kids to play & a splash pad for them to cool down in the summer. Well maintained soccer pitch as well.\n\nThey officially have an indoor volleyball court & rumour has it that the coach works you hard to get your skills up to speed.
