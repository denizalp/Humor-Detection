416 Snack Bar is the kind of place you can go to enjoy tiny, tasty foods, well-made cocktails and excellent service (my discarded stir sticks were never on the table longer than 30 seconds) while oggling the crowd of young men who look like they may have at one point been involved in criminal activities but have since cleaned up their acts and now own successful, legit businesses while holding onto a bit of that bad boy aura that makes you want to rip off their short-sleeved yet tasteful grey leopard print button-up cholo shirts and have dirty sex in the bathroom (but you will have to wait because there are only two).
