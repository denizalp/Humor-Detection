It's a McD's, so it's fast food. What do you expect? The reason for the one star is service. This morning I pulled up to the window ordering a bacon egg and cheese bagel. A sandwich that's a pretty popular seller. I was asked to pull forward and they would bring it out to me. Standard procedure that's fine. So I pulled up to the spot and was listening my podcast. As I listen to my podcast I saw eight cars call behind me and leave. After sitting for five minutes I turned off my car and wanted to see what the problem was. I went in and told the girl at the counter that I've been waiting for five minutes for a sandwich.  My suspicions were correct, I had been forgotten. The manager seemed a little put off with my frustration. After I reiterated to her that I had been waiting five minutes for a sandwich that many people have gotten after me she merely gave me an apple pie. An actual apology that sounded believable would've been appreciated much more.
