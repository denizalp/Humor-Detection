Any kids dream!\n\nThis is the first LEGO store I have ever seen anywhere. As a kid I loved building things and LEGOs where defiantly one of my favorite toys growing up. This place is all things LEGO. They carry just about every LEGO set available, ranging from Star Wars Imperial Star Destroyers to Pirates of the Caribbean play sets. Before warned that some of the sets can cost almost $500 though.\n\nThey do have stuff you won't find at Target, Wal-Mart or Toys R Us. They even have a wall of LEGOs with every color you could ever think of. Kids can even make their own custom LEGO people. \n\nCustomer service is great and they are very helpful and really seem to love their jobs. Can you blame them? They get paid to play with LEGO's all day!\n\nIf you're into LEGO's defiantly check this place out!
