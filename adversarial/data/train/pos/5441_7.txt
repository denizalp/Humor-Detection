Called this company to come out for an emergency service to mesa to remove bees in our condo. Shortly after calling I called back to cancel service as it turns out our condos HOA would cover cost with their vendor. I spoke with Joe both times. After requesting to cancel Joe told me because it was 30 minutes since my call ( which my call logs show otherwise) he would need to charge me a $95 service fee. I disputed the fee and told him I wouldn't pay it as its an emergency service, and I called to cancel out of courtesy to them. Joe then sarcastically said \"you can't pay $95?\" I said I wouldn't and Joe told me to F*** off and hung up the phone. Excellent customer service from Joe and your company. Keep up the great work it sure looks like it's working here on yelp.
