Run away!  This hotel is not just a little bad it's horrific. I stayed here only due to a convention I was attending. It rained the night after we checked in and we woke in the morning to sodden floors and water running down the large window.\n\nAfter some arguing the hotel moved us to another room. Seriously we had to argue. Apparently they expected us to stay in the room with sodden carpets and a leaking window.  Hotel amenities close promptly at 7pm clearly they think they are in Florida half the population of the hotel doesn't even get out of bed until then\n\nRestaurants also close ridiculously early. Some as early as 1pm. Even with 3000 convention attendees checking in the hotel didn't put extra staff on check in causing the line to take hours at both check in and check out. \n\nI was locked out of my room in two separate occasions due to a faulty door. This is the only thing the hotel felt the need to apologize for. After much protesting that they couldn't comp me anything (of course they can its Vegas) they finally caved and comped two nights off my resort fees. That's what you get when you loose access to your room for ten hours. Then when I checked out they tried to charge me for the resort fees they had comped me. \n\n\nThere was an elevator that kept dropping and engaging and he emergency brakes. We nicknamed it the elevator of death. Even though we reported it the lift was still dropping on the day we checked out.\n\nThe convention area is 0.8 miles from the casino floor making ideal for any kind of fitness convention but probably not anything that may include the elderly or handicapable folks. My Fitbit read over 40 miles on one particularly busy day.\n\nTo close don't book here if you have a choice. If you have no choice brace yourself it's going to get ugly.
