This is actually a review of Dagwoods' Laval location but I imagine they're quite similar. \n\nIt was eerily like Subway but fewer choices of toppings. They did slice the cheese which is a plus but not enough to offset the mediocre taste. It was serviceable for getting a sandwich to go but definitely would not stop there again.
