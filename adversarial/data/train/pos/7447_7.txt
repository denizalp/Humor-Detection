This Rexall is my favourite in the area, mostly because it hasn't failed me yet on having what I want, and also enough choice too.\n\nOk, I'll be real. I like this location because it carries NYX cosmetics. And because all the cosmetics displays are consistently so well lit, laid out, organised, and cleaned. There are testers for basically everything and none of them are gross. (Looking at you, Shoppers Drug Mart two blocks down the street.)\n\nBut in the interest of being universally informative, I will also say that the snack and candy aisles are of satisfactory length. There was even more than one variety of greek yogurt to choose from -- that's how you know you're at a fancy drugstore. Anyway, food...that's all we really care about in a pharmacy, right?\n\nWhat? You want actual drugs at a drugstore?\nFull disclosure: I haven't ever bought any medicine from this drugstore. But I HAVE admired their selection of ice creams, and that's basically the same as far as effectiveness in treating illnesses, amirite?\n\nOf course, as with all large Canadian drugstore chains (looking at you again, Shoppers Drug Mart), beware the large markups on almost all products.
