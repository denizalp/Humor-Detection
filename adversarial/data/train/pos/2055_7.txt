I remember an old Will and Grace episode where karen is wearing a disguise and eating at a taco shack.  This is how I feel about Pete's.  \n\nIt has been in business and the hearts of phoenicians since 1947.  It is my guilty pleasure.  This particular location is just a short drive down Central from my House.  \n\nI agree with the yelpers review about ambience.  Lets hope you like bird watching because ALL pete's locations are strictly outdoor seating.  The food is great.  Deep fried goodness!\n\nThey have an amazing sauce that goes well with everything.  Part Ketchup, Part hot sauce.  Simply amazing.\n\nCash Only!!!!\n\nSee you there!
