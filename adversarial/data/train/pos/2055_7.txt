There's some nice stuff on offer here, but it really reflects the neighborhood it's in.  Most of the stuff for sale is very tasteful (lots of pastel upholstery, lots of cherry and mahogany wood), but it's not my style at all.  The art is well priced, though--lots of great pieces for twenty to forty dollars, and it's not as staid as the furniture.  I love poking around stores like this, so I'll probably stop in next time in Leaside, but I can't see myself buying anything here.
