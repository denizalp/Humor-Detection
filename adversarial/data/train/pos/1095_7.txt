My boyfriend and I go to strip clubs about once a week. We like to find a favorite place and go back repeatedly and even bring some friends some times. It's our favorite way to socialize and we spend lots of money.\n\nI have never had a negative experience at a strip club..... Until tonight.\n\nMy boyfriend and I decided to try a exotic dance club nearby instead of heading east. We found Pink Cabaret on the map as being very close to where I live, so we headed there.\nThere's a girl at the front entrance to take the cover charge which was only $5. Before entering I asked her if they serve food. \nShe said \"no but we have a list of places that deliver\" , she showed us a few places including Dominoes. I wanted hot wings but I don't like the wings from Dominoes. I said, I'd think about what I wanted. We went inside and had a couple of drinks but I was still craving hot wings. \nMy boyfriend decided to order from Bruno's, a restaraunt that was just a mile away. We asked one of the hospitality\/door man\/security guys at the front if it was ok and he said no problem, people order all the time. He said we could either leave the money at the front desk or he would come inside and let us know when the delivery arrived. We were like \"wow every one is so nice here\". The bartender was super nice. The bartender went out of his way to make sure I loved my drink. Our waitress, Mandy, was very attentive. I did notice that she said \"welcome to Christie's\" when she introduced herself, so maybe they are changing the name of the club soon.\nAnyway, the wing delivery arrived and the hospitality\/door man\/security guy came to get us to pay for it. \nSo we were happily drinking alcohol and eating our wings with one of the cute blonde strippers named LOVE. She was a little hungry so I offered her some wings. \nThen this guy comes over and starts saying something about how we brought outside food into his establishment. I thought he was joking so I asked him if he wanted some wings. \nHe was serious though. \nHe was very accusatory saying that bringing our food in was the equivalent of bringing our own alcohol into a bar.\n I said, \"your front desk told us we could order delivery here.\"  \nWe weren't being sneaky or trying to do anything wrong. We had permission. Hell they even encouraged it.\nHe very rudely said \"I don't know how many times I have to repeat that I'm the manager and you are not allowed to bring outside food in\". He went overboard in asserting his authority.\nMy boyfriend said \"you should talk to your front desk\".\n I was very embarrassed and I'm non confrontational, so I just said \"ok\" and packed my food up. I have never been embarrassed that way. \n\nA minute later while my boyfriend got a private lap dance from Love, the manager came over and told me \"well if the front door already said it was ok, go ahead and enjoy yourself\". \nI just said \"ok\" and smiled.\nTo be honest it was too lil too late. He caused a scene and He didn't even apologize. \nWhen my boyfriend came back to the table, we settled our tab and left.\n\n I think the manager should learn how to talk to customers without being rude and make sure there is some consistency amongst the staff as to what their policies are, so this type of situation can be avoided.\n\nWe will not return.
