Currently the largest spa in the US and the 3rd largest overall in the world, the Canyon Ranch Spa is well worth it!  The treatments and specialized rooms cater to your body's needs and I was very happy to try 3 different treatments for my first time here.  I had an energizing body scrub and bath soak for 50 minutes provided by Selena, who was so nice and polite.  For my 50 minute Canyon Ranch full body massage, it was similar to a Swedish massage and was provided by Samuel, who had great techniques with applying just the right amount of pressure to prove for better results and relaxation.  My facial included wraps for both feet & hands, and was provided by Alicia who gave me helpful tips to address my adult acne.  I purchased the toner with rose hips which she highly recommended.  Another plus about this spa was that my treatments were prepaid and I didn't have to worry about computing the tip at the end because it was already applied upon my approval.  The overall experience was excellent and worth the long walk from Venetian to Palazzo on the 4th floor which is where it is located.  Thanks to the staff for an enjoyable experience, would love to come back and treat myself again:)
