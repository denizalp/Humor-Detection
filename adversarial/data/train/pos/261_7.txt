So based on the Yelp reviews I came in to try it out for myself. I walked into this spotless restaurant and I ordered my guilty pleasure and once a month craving of nachos, except this time I ordered them with Al Pastor. Can I tell you? These were divine. The meat was smoky, sweet, and tender. The generous amount of guacamole was made with some jalapeno in it and gave the nachos that awesome spiciness I was craving. Oh, and the guacamole? Real stuff, not that neon green stuff you get at other places. The beans tasted like homemade pinto beans, not the refried stuff that usually comes with nachos. Everything on these nachos worked together perfectly. The bottom of the nachos did get a little soft towards the end but that's why you get yourself a fork and call it a day. \n\nWhat made this visit amazing (other than the delicious food) was the awesome customer service they're dishing out. I was greeted by a very friendly young lady who proceeded to ask me if I was a first-timer and if I worked nearby (yes, we spoke in Spanish so I had no language barrier issues, deal), she then proceeded to offer me samples of all their aguas frescas (literally, \"fresh waters\"), yes, all of them. One by one I tried them all and, surprisingly settled on the spinach (try it before you judge me!!). Not only is the food a welcome change in this neighborhood, but the friendly service makes this one of the very few places that still know how to talk to a paying customer. \n\nI will definitely be returning, and taking as many people as I can with me (I'm Mexican, we travel in packs). This food and service deserves to be shared and I promise to do my part. Always in support of a small business!! Anda Frijoles (oh, by the way, that means \"beans\")!!
