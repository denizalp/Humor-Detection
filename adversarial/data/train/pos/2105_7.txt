I know this is a \"beloved\" Kennywood classic, but I just cannot find reasons to love it.\n\nFirst off, the wait was dreadful, but I'll overlook that because it is located in an amusement park filled with hungry people. I ordered right off the menu--fries drizzled in cheddar cheese and loaded with bacon. That sounds delicious right? Well, what I got a pile of soggy fries drowned in grease and cheese with pieces of stale bacon on top that literally tasted like salty cardboard. Goodbye appetite, goodbye $7.  \n\nFinal verdict: It was a $7 poorly spent. I am a huge french fries fan, but I am definitely NOT a fan of the fries at The Potato Patch.
