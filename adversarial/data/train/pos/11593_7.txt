Dave Dyer promised to sell my car for me, then claimed someone stole the car from him, then took possession of my car, promised to pay me, and never did. I have filed a complaint with the AZ Attorney General and am pursuing legal action against APEX. Do not trust this man, no matter how convincing he may seem about his character and integrity. It's been a very sad situation.
