YELP 365 CHALLENGE 2014-(92\/365) \"Free Ride\"\n\nSo we just happened to be \"playing Tourists\" at The LINQ and we passed the High Roller and inquired about their projected opening. The gentlemen at the door mentioned that Caesar's Gaming Employees had access to ride, then asked us if we were locals.\nWe said \"Yes we are!\" so he handed us a couple of tickets and said \"Enjoy your ride!\".\n\nAs you step inside, you pass through a couple staging areas where employees are constantly telling you \"right this way\" and \"enjoy your ride!\" then you take a quick souvenir photo(to pick up after wards at the sky shop). one area shows you a quick video and gives you a last chance to back out like a wuss if you choose to do the walk of shame. Lastly, there's restrooms to do your business so you're not holding it for the duration of the ride(Half an hour long) For those who wanna snack and booze it up during your ride, there's a concession stand to get drinks and snacks before you board your pod.\n\nYou are lead outside to a waiting area beside the High Roller, and when its your time to enter, do so calmly, but quickly! The wheel is constantly moving very slow, and hardly ever stops! Its like getting on and off an escalator. Inside, there's enough seating for about 10-12 people, and the rest of the space is standing room only, or if you wish, sit on the pod floor. Up to 40 people fit in one pod, but during our ride, we had about 15-20 people which was better IMHO....sufficient space to sit\/stand and move around freely inside the pod during the ride which also allowed for lots of pictures which I'm sure will be more limited as it opens to the public and more people are allowed in the pods. I also feel bad for those who don't do well in claustrophobic settings. as this ride may make one feel that way.\n\nAs the ride ends, exit the pod the same way you entered it, but on the opposite side you entered from, You are then led under the High Roller to the Sky Shop were you can pick up gifts and even your souvenir photo if you wish. It is an awesome ride that everyone should experience at least once. I heard that it is beautiful at night when the wheel and the strip is all lit up. ALOHA!!!\n\nShaka Meter:  \\uuu\/  \\uuu\/  \\uuu\/  \\uuu\/  \\uuu\/  5\n\n* I heard the admission may be $30 and the hours may be from 10 am to 2 am
