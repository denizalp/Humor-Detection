I have wicked cravings for their fried goat cheese on a daily basis.  They're goddamned ridiculous and probably the best thing I've ever tasted.  I mean, they literally melt in your mouth.  And I'm not even a fat person.  That says something.\n\nOther than that, the usual stuff applies.  The service is decent.. Melissa served us last night and was busy but yet very nice and attentive.  The Sangria is sweet and thankfully sold by the pitcher.  The restaurant is small and fun.\n\nI could compare Firefly and Barcelona, but there really isn't any point.  Tapas is tapas and both places are decent to me.
