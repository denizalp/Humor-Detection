I feel like this place was better 7 years back. Maybe trends have changed or no one is willing to get rid of their threads anymore.\n\nLast time I was here I felt there was a plethora of clothing available to me. Nice, higher end (ish) second hand items. I left with a few pairs of jeans, some slacks, skirts, shoes.... \n\nThis time, I was looking for a single item. A dress to wear to a wedding and a new sport coat for the gent. I found bot a single item work trying on. I was a little disturbed they didn't have a little section for long dresses and found myself just circling the area in hopes of something literally jumping out at me. No luck and the items I did see that caught my eye, were heavily priced for second hand even if the tag said American Eagle or Bebe or whatever. The condition and overall look didn't warrant the attached tag. Maybe I should have browsed more aggressively but I was put off by this experience vs. years ago.\n\nThe gent is a tall man, nothing in his size fit merely because they had all been tailored. It ends up being a hit or miss place in my book. Miss this time, maybe better luck next time?
