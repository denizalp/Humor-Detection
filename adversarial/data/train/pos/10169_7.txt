Stayed at Palms Casino while in Vegas to see DEPECHE MODE\n\nOur room was in the Fantasy Tower & it was huge - comfy bed w\/ nice fluffy pillows.  Little sitting area & the bathroom was equally ginormous w\/ a whirlpool tub & great-smelly products\n\nEven though they're well off the Strip, they offer a complimentary shuttle that will take people to & from Caesars Palace & I thought that was a very nice touch.  We did not take advantage of this service but it is great to know for next time!\n\nSeems all hotels around here charge this ridiculous \"Resort Fee\" - which is really another way to gouge customers for more money.....we were told this included free wi-fi among other things but considering this Resort Fee is not optional, we're actually paying for the wi-fi.....but whatever\n\nPalms offers great restaurants, a world-class concert hall & free shuttles - what's not to love about this place?\n\nOnly minor snafu was as we were leaving.......when we checked in, the concierge setup an airport shuttle for us for 4am the next morning but they never showed.  \n\nNo big deal since there was a huge line of cabs just waiting to take us to the airport but when I went in to advise the Bellhop we couldn't wait for the shuttle any longer but were happy to take a cab, he said no way & took us to the airport HIMSELF b\/c he felt so badly our shuttle service forgot us\n\nHow nice is that?!  With all these service perks & people who really care about customer service, we'd most definitely consider Palms for another Vegas stay
