Went on Friday night last week and had a horrible experience. We arrived and checked in with the hostess,  4 adults and a baby (3 months to be exact) she asked if we wanted inside, outside, or first available. We opted for first available and we were told 45min to an hour. After an hour and 10 minutes we get taken to our table, IN THE SMOKING SECTION. \n\nObviously we asked to be moved as the people next to us were smoking and that's not something we want to expose our 3 month old too. Was the staff understanding? NO\n\nWe were told we could A) get our name put back on the list, which would mean another 45min wait,  or B) we could sit at another table in the smoking section further away from anyone currently smoking, but with no guarantee that someone wouldn't come smoke next to us. \n\nSince when did it become acceptable to assume that a child should be exposed to second hand smoke?! When asking inside, outside, or first available, you really need to ask if we wanted smoking or non smoking. Better yet,  never assume a child should be exposed to second hand smoke unless the parents request it. \n\nThe Perch has not only lost my business but my friends family and anyone who will listen. Simply appalling.
