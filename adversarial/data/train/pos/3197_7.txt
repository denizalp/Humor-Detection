I would sign up to be the spokesperson for this business if there was not a line of Yelpers who are already doing so. I have few places that I go to for my light frozen treat. Besides one frozen yogurt shop and Frost Bites, I don't really go anywhere else when I need to cool down.\n\nThe owners, Will and Mike, are friendly and engaging. It is nice to just chat with them as you are devouring their fresh ribbons of snow ice. I have tried all the flavors now and it is hard to deviate from matcha green tea or the black sesame. All the other flavors are delicious, but I will definitely pick my favorite child. This is one of the few new businesses in Vegas that I recommend everyone to. \n\nSome of the best combos I have had are:\nCoconut Delight with chocolate sprinkles and caramel sauce. Just like the girl scout cookies.\nEx\"straw\"binary with fresh strawberries and strawberry condense milk.\nSmooth Green Tea with strawberries and condense milk.\nBlack Sesame with almonds and condense milk.\nMucho Mango with fresh mangoes and pineapple.
