Let's be real here. You're not here at Sushi Moto because you heard that the sushi there is \"hands down the best you will ever have\", or that the food is so amazing, you had a \"foodgasm\", or  [insert other Yelp\/Foodie cliches here].\n\nAt the end of the day, if you're coming out to Sushi Moto Wine and Sake Bar, you're some kinda yuppie with some kinda money to burn, and you wanna sit in a fancy looking place to have sushi that you could have eaten for half the price at Sushi Bong down the street - and really almost any other sushi joints in the area.\n\nThe two of us sat down in a large booth, and we ordered asahi, plum wine (they only have one selection), chirashi, and three rolls. I'm not going to go into which rolls we ordered because they were all really good. The unfortunate issue is just the pricing. $90 after tax and tip for two and only one drink each - that's unfortunate, no?\n\nThey have wide selection of wine and sake (although sushi and wine sounds weird) and would prefer it if you sat down and had continued to drink all night long. \n\nThis place is really either a 3 star or a 4 star depending on your expectation. If you're expecting value, then it's a 3 star. If you are expecting a fancy night out with some girlfriends or boyfriends (i don't judge), with no money concerns then it would be a four star.\n\nMy bumping this up to a 4 star is not because i have money to burn, but because my friend does :)
