I know I just got married and Jared is definitely the love of my life, but I must confess, I have a big crush on another man... \n\nI heart Jason Millstein of Illume Photography.  From the moment we met Jason, we knew he was the one that we would choose to capture the memories of our wedding day.  Jason's work speaks for itself.  His passion and his background in photojournalism are evident in the images he captures... and his energy and enthusiasm are contagious!   Not only is Jason professional, but he made the process fun!\n\nJason met us to do a walk through on site prior to the big day, so we would know what to expect.  And when the day arrived, we felt at ease with Jason in control.  He pushed us just enough so that we would keep to our schedule and get pictures of everything we requested.  He and his team were personable with our family and friends and Minnie too!  It was crazy hot on our wedding day, but the crew worked through the heat... \n\nTo date, I've only seen a preview of the images that Jason took on our wedding day, but the ones I saw are amazing.  I'm confident that I'll be extremely pleased when I see the rest.  (I'll update my review when I do.)  Jared and I will treasure the memories of our incredible wedding day through our photos for the rest of our lives, and we're extremely pleased with our decision to work with Illume Photography.
