I have transportation booked for my weekend girls trip to Vegas...which also happens to be my birthday weekend! \nso far the process has been painless and super accommodating. \n\nETA does custom wraps on the vehicles depending on the occasion. \n\nI didn't request a wrap, but i am fascinated by the samples I saw! \n\nI will update my review once I experience my trip\n\nsuper excited!
