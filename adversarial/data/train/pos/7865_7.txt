This may be a wasted review since they're no longer in business but I have to share our experience. We came to Moss' shortly after they were featured on RI. It was a direct shot up Route 57 from Wooster to Elyria. They had already retreated to older dishes and habits.\n\nChose Crab stuffed mushrooms as an app and they were good. She used blue crab and topped with bacon. There was also bacon on my wedge salad and since bacon is a favorite of mine I was pleased.\n\nMain course was the 12-oz ribeye. It was 2 dollars more than their signature prime rib entree but frankly I was hesitant to order prime rib because the owner was not especially friendly and I feared I would experience her previous recipe.\n\nThey offer a side Caesar salad which I found unique and unusual. \n\nThe trip wasn't a waste and we came more for curiosity to see an RI improved restaurant then expecting a WOW dinner.\n\nShamefully, this business was a waste of Robert Irvine's time and effort.
