I tried to come to this library a couple times this week, but I kept forgetting they didn't open until 11 a.m. Tues-Thurs.  Budget cuts stink.\n\nI finally made it in and stood in line to get a new library card.  The lady before me had checked out her maximum 35 items and was returning them to the counter, so I had to wait until the clerk was finished with those before I could go up to the window.\n\nShe told me I had a library card from the year 2000 and so I would have to pay $2 to replace it.  Yeah, I have lived in 4 other states in the last ten years... I did not keep my library card.  No problem, I thought.  Then she told me I had $9.90 in fines from 2001.  Hmm?  Strange since I moved out of state in 2001, but okay.  The library obviously needs the money, so I decided to pay the fines.  She directed me to another terminal and once I figured that out and paid, I had to stand back in line to get my card.\n\nSo, my first visit to the Burton Barr Library in 12 years went like this:\n\nWalked in.  Waited in line.  Paid a fine.  Waited in line.  Got my card.  Left to pick up my daughter.\n\nSo, why 4 stars? \n1.) this library is gorgeous \n2.) the clerk was very helpful, even though the system is not the most efficient\n3.) they are pretty clean for a downtown library\n4.) you can check out Kindle books, a Culture Pass for local museums, music and videos\n\nSupport your local libraries!  I've been a creature of Amazon Prime and have not spent nearly enough time inside a library.  That will all change now that my library card and I are reunited.
