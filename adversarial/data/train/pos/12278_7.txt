I love this place, but today they deserve ZERO stars. I only gave them one because obviously you have to. The big fat ass redhead chic (who unfortunately is the manager) was so rude! She looked at me and I asked her if there was one register open and she proceeded to continue her conversation with her co-worker ( a short butchy girl with spiky hair and tattoos). I was ready to walk out until this guy offered to help me. I guess these days it is more important to tap about NON-WORK RELATED issues instead of assisting the customer. Makes sense why the idiots got my order WRONG because she \"only heard\" what she \"thought\" I said. I realize it's the mall and all, but if they want to play, they should quit work because it is a business, not the playground. I only advise customers to get assistance from someone else in the store.
