I don't even know what to say about this place.  I hate it in principle.  I hate Toby Keith, I hate his music, the things he sings about, his portrayal of \"American\" and how \"Americans\" should be.  I don't like the guy at all.\n\nI do, however, like a good bar that plays country music and I love bbq.  \n\nSo the perfect storm of a restaurant presents itself in \"I Love This Bar\" - an Ikea-sized restaurant with a bar the size of an aircraft carrier.  There are TVs all over the place and waitresses in skimpy cut off jeans and boots.  This place definitely has potential.\n\nThe bbq chicken wrap (I was shocked they had a wrap!) that I ordered came out very quickly and was pretty good.  It came with the option of \"freedom fries\" but I will never in my life order anything named \"freedom\" so I got potato salad.  It was pretty basic, mustard base, and not bad.  All in all, a pretty decent meal.\n\nThe price, on the other hand, was outrageous.  I couldn't really figure it out.  Even totally the cost of all the TVs in the place I couldn't justify such expensive food.  Now that I see military people get free food, I see the rest of us are footing the bill.  What a joke.  It's not enough that they get perks in every other aspect of life or that mindless idiots give them standing ovations at baseball games, now I have to pay to feed them...AGAIN!  My tax dollars already feed them, and clothe them, AND house them!  Nothing against military people, but for a bunch of people who tend to be anti-socialists, you sure do love having the rest of us cover you.\n\nI will not be back to Toby Keith's.  I went to be ironic.  I went, that's that.  Now I can say I've been and how hilarious it was.
