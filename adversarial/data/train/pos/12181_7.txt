I was in Charlotte for a few hours and wanted to try some good food. Specifically good seafood. Someone suggested seafood connection and the pics looked so tempting i delayed my stay about 30 mins. The front door was locked but luckily, i saw a couple walk towards a side entrance and i followed. There is a sign stating they're under construction...not sure what the place was like before construction but i knew the food was going to be LIT as soon as I walked it. \nYou get in line to place your order, you're given a number then you sit and wait for your number to be called. I didn't wait too long(15 mins) before my number was called. I ordered the Steamed Crablegs Plate($30) and there was a thick ass layer of butter on everything i had a heart attack but who cares. \nThere is no place to sit and eat so it's all to go. I asked for wet wipes but they didn't have any and my container was so full, it wouldn't close so i knew I needed a lot of room(vehicle not sufficient) to spread and eat. \n\nI drove back home to GA to eat. Quickly reheated everything and my goodness....I've never eaten that many crablegs and wanted more. The potatoes and corn were also delectable. The flavor involves a whole lot of garlicky seasoning and it melds so well with the tender crab meat. I have never been so sad and still hungry after a huge meal as this so I'll definitely swing by again next time I'm in Charlotte!
