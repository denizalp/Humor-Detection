Almost entirely vegetarian chinese restaurant (they serve some dead fishies. boo!)  There are like um no veggie or vegan restaurants in las vegas and this is an oasis in the oasis (ha!)...if you are a veggie or vegan or a connoisseur of fake meat, you MUST try this place. amazing. order the mongolian beef, tomato beef chow mein, sweet and sour chicken.  support this place if you live in vegas or are visiting vegas on more than a stripper and coke binge.  or fuck it, even if you are on a stripper and coke binge...stop by for a respite from the madness! l will be eating here again tomorrow night so I will have another update when I get back. everyone, please sit tight.\n\nhours: 11:30 am - 10:30 pm every day.  CLOSED SUNDAYS.  learned this the hard way.
