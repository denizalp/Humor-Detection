For something highly publicized on Man vs. Food and on the Travel Channel, I expected more from this restaurant. \n\nFor starters, I expected the hot dog to be monstrous. Don't get me wrong, it was large, and not eatable by 1 person, but the taste was just average. We got \"The Unit\" w\/ everything on it for $18.99 -- but in reality, that dog should've cost $5 if you put it together at home. Price-wise, it was decent splitting it with 3 people, about $7 a person. On the flip side, they have good customer service and great tasting fries! My party should've got other entrees and starters.
