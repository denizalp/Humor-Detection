Jose Andres makes food that fascinates and delivers via unusual methods. This guy is the king of \"molecular gastronomy\" - which we have had the pleasure of trying at both The Bazaar in Beverly Hills and 'e (that's right, just e') the private dining experience at the Cosmopolitan Hotel in Las Vegas. Both 5 star experiences also. There is a price that comes with this - but you will likely not have a more memorable gastronomical experience than at a Jose' Andres establishment, this I can say with great enthusiasm! \n\nI am truly a more visual and tactile individual and my words could never provide any justice to my actual experience! We have enjoyed all Jose Andres restaurants and tasting menus for different reasons. This location has amazing decor, cures it's own \"meat\" as in the name! Has a pseudo hunting decor in the middle of the Vegas strip (makes sense...meat again)!  \n\nWhen we arrived, we were offered a seat in the private dining room which is known as the Silver Room (it has been passed on that this was an original control room for the roller coaster that was part of the former Sahara) - it is a stunning room and we are sure we would have been treated in grand style...however, we chose to eat at the counter, where we could watch the chef's in action. We also knew Jose Andres was in town during this period to work set up solar cooking at a music and culinary festival. We had no such luck of seeing him on this evening! \n\nSince Jose Andres is known for working with liquid nitrogen...we wanted to start the evening off right, with a cocktail called the, LN2 Don't Be a Lemon. It is made table side of liquid nitrogen. Then our evening got off as a tasting menu of various meats and I will let my photos do the talking...\n\nIt was all pure love...
