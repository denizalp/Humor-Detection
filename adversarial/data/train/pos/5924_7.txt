I was looking forward to the new location but boy was I disappointed. \n\nThe service was awful.  It was so bad that it literally took over 30 minutes from the time the first meal was brought out until the fourth.  The excuse was that another waitress had mistaken the missing meal and delivered it to the wrong table.  Maybe, but then why did our 2 other meals arrive 20 minutes late.  I have to wonder who is running the place.  The manager offered a weak apology.  \n\nThree of us ordered meals calling for tortilla shells.  We had to hunt down the waitress to get them.  Even then it was about 15 minutes before they arrived. By which time our food was turning cold.  When they came they were wrapped tightly in aluminum foil so were very soggy and falling apart.\n\nI felt sorry for our server.  She was working hard and running from table to table but the manager and the kitchen were making her look bad and adding to her work load.\n\nThe food was just OK.  Typical storefront Tex-Mex.  No thought went into the presentation.  The flavors were very flat.\n\nFinally they had a very poor entertainer performing.  He added nothing but noise to the atmosphere.\n\nMaybe the owner should get rid of the musician and use the money to hire an expeditor to oversee the kitchen.
