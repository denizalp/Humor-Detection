What a great place to come and get groceries! There is something for everyone. You can buy for one person or a whole family here as they sell in small amounts plus bulk here and I feel like the prices are very competitive to other stores that sell in bulk. \n\nMy favorite sections of this store has got to be their produce and their dry self-serve bulk area. When I came here, their produce looked fresh and was cheap, like 69 cents a lb for their green beans! They sold carrots, onions, tomatoes, apples, bananas, avocado and many other items by the cases which is a great savings for those that need to buy in large quantities. \n\nThey also have a large meat and dairy section. However, I didn't find that the meat was any cheaper than getting it at Walmart and they sold most of it in large quantities, so it isn't ideal for someone needed to get something just for that day or for just one meal. Some of the cheeses seemed like it may be cheaper than some stores, but not enough so for me to come out of my way to come here to buy it. \n\nThe day that I came here was the day after Christmas, so they had tables and tables of clearance items in the middle of walkways and lots and lots of boxes that needed to be stocked, so even though the store was \"clean\" it was not organized. It was hard to maneuver around everything and the other customers that were in the store. I'm sure on a normal day, this place is very organized. \n\nStaff didn't seem all that friendly and definitely didn't go out of their way to help you or say hi. \n\nWould come back again if I was in the area and needed something that this store offered.
