I hang out at freemont casino prolly too much for the rating and review I'm going to give it but this is how I feel about it. \n\nDrinks are cheap when it comes to beer they have a $2 special on a lot of yummy beers. Some bartenders are pretty amazing and nice. Also a lot of them are unnecessarily rude and buzz killers. \n\nThe table game dealers are mean. Not only mean but rude and not friendly some don't even smile and when you try talking to them they are rude. Most of the are miserable, act miserable and look miserable. There are maybe two that do look like they are not bitter tho. \n\nI would definitely not recommend this casino to anyone looking to have fun. If you want to gamble and nothing more. No talking no smiling no humanity. Then this is your place.
