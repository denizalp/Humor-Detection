Excellent food! Loved the Mexican hotdog, ribeye taco, breaded fish tacos, bean and cheese burrito and their salsa. \n\nThe ribeye taco is tender beef that is seasoned very well and comes in a flour tortilla. \n\nThe fish taco is also amazing and comes in a corn tortilla. It's breaded and also very tender. \n\nThe Mexican hotdog is wrapped in bacon and topped with mushrooms, pinto beans, tomato and guacamole sauce. The bread is butter toasted, sweet and soft. The different ingredients in the hotdog mesh very well. \n\nThe order taker\/cashier was very friendly, kitchen staff is accommodating and all keep their restaurant very clean. I will definitely make a trip back here!
