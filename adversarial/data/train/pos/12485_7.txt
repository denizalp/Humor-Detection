Red Lobster. It's the seafood equivalent to Applebees, Chili's, TGI Fridays...you know those chains. These places won't kill you with food poisoning but their food will generally be a level of 'whatever' that makes you reconsider why you spent 33 bucks on the crazy entree roulette wheel deal. \n\nI'm not a huge fan of fish or lobster unless I am near an ocean. There is no disappointment like getting gross fish. They had advertised a lobster roll sandwich deal. It sounds tempting but I know this game of disappointment. \n\nI went with tried and true popcorn shrimp and friend shrimp combo. I played the odds. It's hard to really mess up shrimp. If you get a bad shrimp, well, next one will be better. The popcorn and fried shrimp are basically the same thing, just different sizes. The cocktail sauce was just sad. Not a dab of horse radish to be found in that sauce. Eating shrimp and not getting a sinus clearing blast of horse radish? It didn't matter. We all know why most people go to Red Lobster anyway.\n\nDEM CHEDDA BAY BISCUITS. \n\nI filled up on dem biscuits. Mashed potatoes had some garlic flavor in there. My Italian dressing needed more salad, but I guess that's my fault for not asking for dressing on the side. I made the right choice in the end. \\\n\nOther people got the lobster roll combo. While everyone else's salads came out, they explained that the salad comes with the lobster roll itself. When the roll did come out, it was apparent why the salad came with the meal. The lobster roll was tiny, even for roll sandwich standards. It also came with approximately 7 french fries. The lobster looked closer to imitation crab meat. I thought to myself, \"at least I didn't spend so much money on my disappointment.\"
