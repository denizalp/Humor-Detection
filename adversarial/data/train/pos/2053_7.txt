Um, this place is a tradition - a staple for all graduating UIUC folk like myself.  I didn't fully appreciate it when I was there. Senior year, I started going more often, to partake in the insanely cheap margaritas and filling, hearty Mexican food.  Now, whenever I visit my campus, I return to get my fill of the deliciousness.\n\nI love how incredibly inexpensive this place is.  Seriously, $16 for a 60 oz pitcher of margaritas?  WHAT?  We'll take two, thanks.  $9.50 for a big portion of fajitas with tons of delicious beans, rice, and guac?  Totes.  And if you order off the ala carte menu, you can practically pay with change from under your couch.\n\nIt's actually pretty tasty too.  I looooove their tamales.  The bean burritos are pretty good too, and as soon as I bite into that familiar salsa, I melt.  They refill the chips constantly.  Portions are large and satisfying - it's pretty classic Mexican food for an American crowd, not reinventing the wheel here, but it's consistent and nostalgic.  The margaritas are always delicious, though sometimes they are stronger than others.  Service is usually very friendly and quick.  It's like memories covered in chile sauce with a side of beans and rice.  Dos Reales, I'll always love you.\n\nI bet this place gets mad crowded since they closed the Dos on University Ave.  Why on earth would they do that?  Shame.  Now you need to have a designated driver instead of being able to stumble back to Green Street after dinner.
