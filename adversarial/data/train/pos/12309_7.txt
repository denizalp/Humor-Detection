Mothership has been on my radar for ages now, but I honestly NEVER find myself on this side of town!\nBy a happy coincidence, my fella and I found ourselves with about 2 hours to kill before plans right around the corner. \nWe actually pulled into this shopping center with the intent of hitting Trader Joe's...but I was SO excited to see Mothership here, that we ran over for a coffee.\n\nThe shop is a bit smaller than I had imagined, I'm not really sure why, but its really a lovely space.  Its bright, open, and CLEAN.  \n\nEmployees were super nice, explaining the menu, and offering recommendations. \n\nWe opted for the latte with the lavender bitters, and we were NOT disappointed!\n\nGranted, sure, the cup was kind of small for $5, but you're paying for some good quality coffee, and its a local shop, which I'm always a fan of. \n\nMy fella said it was probably the best cup of coffee he's had in over a year.  \nI agree with him.  I'm interested to know which coffee they used in making the latte, because it was so smooth!!!  \n\nWhen we have a bit more time, I'd like to come back and sample some of their baked goods, and I definitely want to try one of their pour over coffees next time.  I'm a HUGE fan of pour overs, and they have a good selection. \n\nWell done Mothership.  I can't wait to come back.
