I wanted to reschedule my appointment that was 3 weeks away but they charge 5 dollars just for changing the appointment unless you came in person. What an absurd policy. That explains why I had to wait so long in the lobby when I checked in and I checked out because they have people stopping by to make appointments but they only have one person working. And then the massage therapist tried to sell me on some products of some side gigs that she has.  But I was planning on coming every 4 weeks. I totally understand being charged a fee if you cancel at the last minute or don't show, but to not be able to reschedule my appointment at 3 weeks away is just nickeling and diming your customers. When he told me my choice was to be $5 or come in person I told him how about no dollars and go somewhere else.
