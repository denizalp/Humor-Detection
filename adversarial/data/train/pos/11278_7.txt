OH MY GOD. Rollover La Banquise. There is a new poutine king in town. MA Poule Mouillée's poutine is salty, meaty, savory perfection. It comes topped with both Portuguese chicken and chorizo. They are incredibly generous with the cheese curds.  The gravy is dense, and you can taste the chicken skin spices in it.\n\nThe poutine was one of the best things I ever ate in my life. My mouth salivates when I think about it. As I write this review, I am simultaneously trying to book an AirBnB so I can come back for it. \n\nOther then poutine- you can  order chicken sandwiches or 1\/4, 1\/2 or full sized chickens. Their chicken is delicious - super juicy and tender. 1\/4 and 1\/2 sized chickens come with salad and fries. \n\nEverything here tastes better with beer. I can't think of a better late night snack then Ma Poule Mouillée's  poutine or chicken.
