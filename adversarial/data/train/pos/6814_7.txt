Zero stars of I could. This place have the WORST\/RUDEST customer service.  From the many times I purchases from here, they always have the wrong price listed for the item, after having enough of it and bringing it up. They treat me like a big waste of their time. \n\nAlso, they need to either enforce or remove the Express lane. If people are coming in with a cart full of stuff and you don't do anything about it, you're being disrespectful to the customers who actually have under 10 items and are waiting in line. \n\nLast but not least, the supervisor is setting such a terrible example for the employee.  I've been there enough times, and also know Vietnamese so I know when they are talking with the supervisor to know who it is. When I decided to talk to her regarding a purchase, she said \"No, I'm not the supervisor\" and walk away. \n\nI don't care much for a market and what they offer if they treat me like I'm a nuisance every times I walk in.
