I still can't believe NV has Tommy's locations let alone one on my side of town. I will be a regular at this shack you can count on that! I got through my work day and couldn't wait to break in this location on its grand opening day. There was naturally a line when we got inside so I waited to get a table for us while my wife ordered. It didn't take long for our food to arrive and it looked so damn good. I ordered the caliente burger combo. The caliente burger is their original chili burger, but it has chipotle cheese and sliced cascabella chilies on it. I wanted an extra beef patty on it which cost $1.40 and was worth it. I like how you can ask for extra chili on your burger for no extra charge. My burger was great, my fries were great, I was happy. The side of chilies really hit the spot too. It is nice that the food tastes consistent and just like I remember from eating at Tommy's when I lived in southern California. \n\nNot much parking out front, but This location is really tucked into a corner so you will need to most likely park in the strip mall parking which isn't far away. They have a drive thru, but I would only recommend this if you are in a hurry because when you get it to go the food gets wrapped tighter and then you just end up opening your food to find most of the chili on the wrapper.
