This place is surprisingly filling.  After much debate with coworkers where we should get food from, a yelp search and some stomach grumbling, we decided on this place.  None of use had heard of this place before, but sometimes that is a good thing such is the case for here.\n\nAfter looking over the menu we each decided on our choices, I opted for the six piece meal that came with two sides and two sauces for no other reason than I was being greedy that day.  These are not your typical tenders, they are actually better if I may say so myself.  Longer than most tenders you come across when you go elsewhere.  I really think they should have called this place Strips...wait, that would sound bad and make this place sound like a whole different type of establishment than it is.  Breaded and seasoned perfectly and the right size to be able to dip all the way to the end, no need to tear them apart.  The sides were equally satisfying.  I decided, since I was being greedy, to get a double side of tater tots.  I am not sure what it is about tater tots, but I am obsessed with them.  That's why this place was surprisingly filling.  I only opted for the barbeque sauce for my dipping.  Each order also comes with you generic piece of Texas garlic toast.\n\nNow, asides from parking, here is the downside.  If you are choosing to eat in, make sure you are only dining with one other person or alone.  The inside of this place is rather small, with only about three or four two seater tables for dining in.  Unless you plan on eating quickly, I suggest taking your food to go.**\n\n**I just found out that there is an upstairs seating area, I was not aware of this, so if you want to dine in, head upstairs.  My bad.
