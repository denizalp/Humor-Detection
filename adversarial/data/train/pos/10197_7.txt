Humm.. Well the view was pretty nice.. The kid that parked my car was a doll and kept it up front just like I asked him to. The door man was uh, pretentious and unimpressive. Not sure this would be my ideal living arrangement, food shopping would be a huge pain in the butt, if they close the strip (and they do) you are in it to win it, and STUCK until it reopens, no thanks. If you are a young professional and you can walk to work from here it might be fun for a bit..
