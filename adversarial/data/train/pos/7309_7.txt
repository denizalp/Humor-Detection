*Quite possibly the BEST comic store I have ever visited******\n\nI am not a collector of comics (I have bought a few here and there).  I am a HUGE horror film fanatic and found many of my now beloved back issues of FANGORIA, GOREZONE and STARLOG right here--in this store.  Although this was done many years back--I am happy to see this place still around--and from the reviews--still (on average) doing a fantastic job.  \n\nThe employees here were outstanding and kind.  And it was such a pleasure to have that wondrous experience to search through boxes of vintage horror mags and see a glowing evil pumpkin and the year \"1981\"...congrats--you just found Fangoria Issue #15...and what an issue it is.....!\n\nPlaces like AABC make me so sad.  They only remind us at what we all helped to kill (NOBODY is without blame--be honest!)--by ordering off the Internet and not putting our faith & money into establishments that offer a community shelter.  These stores are safehouses for weirdos like me--those who live on the fringes and have eccentric taste--constantly looking for the obscure.  \n\nNext time I am in the Valley--I'm heading straight here.  If you live in the vicinity--get off your ass.  We all think the \"grass is greener.\"  Well--as a Californian--who lives within miles from NUMEROUS comic shops--listen up Phoenicians--you have a treasure here...........right down the street.
