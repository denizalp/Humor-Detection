We've purchased a few items from American Furniture Warehouse & it's good value for what you pay for sure. The staff on the floor super helpful & not at all stalkerish, cashiers are patient & knowledgeable, back of the house at pick up were nice but SLOW. We waited on a Tuesday evening 25 minutes for a chair & nobody was ahead of us in the que. It was an un-assembled accent chair in a box. So not difficult to pick & don't know what the hold up was & no acknowledgement of the long wait time at all. I don't want to even guess how long anything substantial in size would take.
