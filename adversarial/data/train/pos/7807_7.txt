Saturday night, I pondeder making a quick stop in for a bit of live entertainment. Ten years back or so during my last trip to Sin City, Vegas had under ten different locations of this type of business. Apparently there are close to one hundred currently, some open 24 hours which strikes me as peculiar.\nThe valet got me a limo, and in five minutes an enormous shiny black SUV arrived and off we went.\n\n My time frame was two quick drinks and upon my arrival that time was solitified. The music was so loud it was hard to relax, I thought the dancers were average in the looks column and most all sported an array of tattoos that just looked like scribble. Some dancers needed some gym time to tighten up, pole dancing ability was less that I had anticipated. Not to say all the ladies were not working the pole, nor did all of them wear tons of ink, which I just do not find attractive.\n\nThe cocktail waitresses were truly beautiful and attentive, the host and security personal made me feel like a powerful international diplomat. Right at my side, ready to serve my needs with one motion of my hand. \nI'm not sure how I managed to loose my driver's cell phone number, but upon completion of my two adult beverages which were not light on the booze, I signaled my host. After informing him of my inability to contact my driver, I was escorted through a back exit to a parking area where I was loaded into the company vehicle and driven back to my hotel. If that's not customer service, I'm not sure what is. Crazy Horse really focuses on making the client happy and seem to do whatever it takes for their complete satisfaction to occur.
