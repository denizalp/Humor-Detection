This place is adorable! I love the bar and egg crates on the ceilings. They're menu accommodates to all of my family's dietary restrictions (vegetarian, dairy free, gluten free) and has delicious food! Plus people here were nice.\nI ordered the avocado grilled cheese which had spinach on it. It was one of the best dang grilled cheeses I've had in a while. I LOVED the crispy cheese on the ends of the sandwich, my boyfriend was definitely trying to steal bites of it haha. Side salad was good too! Pickle tasted funky to me, I think because I was expecting dill but instead it was almost sweet-tasting. My boyfriend got the croquet madame which looked like a masterpiece! He said a little bit too much cheese but otherwise really good and filled him up. My sister got fruit and roasted veggies, both delicious. My mom got some kind of turkey sandwich but without bread and they were happy to accommodate, she liked it! My dad got a buffalo chicken sandwich and it was huge, he said he enjoyed his meal too. We also got tea which was tasty. I'd be glad to come back!
