Tragically my iphone 6 slipped out of my back pocket, hit the tile floor perfectly and cracked my screen. The first thought i had was to search for iphone repair shops in my area. This store came up, the website is excellent, they give you what they can do and the price at what they can do it for. They even have a section where you can make an appointment online. Appointment time i found of is nice but not really necessary. They take anyone first come first serve.\n\nTo fix my phone i paid 119.12!! It only took 1 hour! This place was quite awesome. The guy at the front desk was very friendly. They had a old school Mortal Kombat arcade game that was free, and a nice big size TV to watch while you waited.\n\nI highly recommend this store and location.
