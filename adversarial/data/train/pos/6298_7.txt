TONS of TVS - we went on a Sunday and every game was on multiple TVs easily.  I had one of their ciabattas, which was sandwich ingredients inside a pita-like wrap - not what I expected, but very tasty.  Also, the fish tacos were definitely a fish burrito (see photos), but it didn't affect the flavors. Also, the cups are HUGE lol - enjoyed the meal and the NFL games.
