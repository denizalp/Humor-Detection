So yummy! Way better than Baskin Robbin which is in the same shopping plaza. I had the pumpkin pie with white chocolate chips and my husband had chocolate and cinnamon roll. We were instantly greeted by the friendly staff and one of the girls offered us to try samples. I tried the chocolate and pumpkin pie (both of which were yummy). It was hard to decide on which to get. I will definitely be back! The frozen yogurt was tasted so delish & was more flavorful than ice cream, but not overly sweet, They also have a nice selection of toppings to choose from. The price was just right. I think it was around $0.45 an ounce. It's so nice to see local places like this pop up in my neighborhood.
