As a child of divorce, I was afraid to commit to someone whose whole job is tearing my hairy-face-union apart. That was until I met Noelle at the Fashion Central location! She made me instantly comfortable and took part in my sarcastic banter while she pressed on through my Eugene Levy caterpillars. \n\nNoelle was very thorough and made it super not-weird to lay there with your eyes shut by talking about the procedures and discussing choice gossip of my choosing (because she's an angel and makes you feel like the best thing since cats on the Internet). \n\nWhen they're done with your face, they slather you in makeup so you can strut around Downtown Calgary just being your bad self without all the redness and whatnot. \n\nIf you want to look like a way-hotter Cyndi Lauper with magnificent brows that could leave you at any time but stay with you because you've been through so much together, go to The Brow Studio in Fashion Central. I've seen Noelle for the initial appointment and for one maintenance meeting so far and I'd recommend her if you're into sweet brows and an ego pump.
