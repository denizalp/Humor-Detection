The ambience reminded me of Las Vegas but that's where the similarities ended. \n\nThe sushi was 'meh' - forgettable and less than fresh. The wait staff was slow and inattentive.  We had a gift card so the experience wasn't quite as disappointing as it would have been. \n\nWhat really tanked this review was the fact that they served a beer that plainly said \"Best By\" and the date on it was 6 MONTHS AGO.\n\nWhen we flagged down the manager he didn't apologize but said \"Are you sure it's not the Born On date (which you can see in the pic that it says \"Best By\"). When this was pointed out to him he blamed the vendor and asked if we wanted another one - even though we were actively on our way out and why would we want more expired beer?\n\nBad management, mediocre food. Save your money and go to Sushi Catcher instead.
