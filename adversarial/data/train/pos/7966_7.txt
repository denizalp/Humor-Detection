This is my very first time having Korean bbq in Vegas and let me say this, this is the best Korean bbq spot I've ever had when it comes to quality of meat. No this is not an AYCE Korean bbq spot so don't expect that here. One thing I have to say though is the side dishes aren't good but the meat is amazing. We didn't have to cook the meat by ourselves but had the servers cook for us. We ordered the Hobak family combo 3 small for 2 people. A bit of regret because we could have eaten more. The meat was so tender and not overly marinated. I've never really had kbbq that tasted so good. \nDefinitely recommend to everyone who enjoy delicious quality meat but I think ordering the large can make you full than ordering the small. \nLastly, when you finish the bbq, they give you ice cream sandwich on a rice cracker which was pretty good. Will come back when I'm in Vegas again.
