We went to meet some friends for a birthday party. Originally they had called to make a reservation and they said they didn't take reservations of Friday. When they arrived there was some confusion \"oh, are you here for the reservation upstairs?\"\nWhen we arrive there are no seats for us. A staff member let us know once that we should watch for servers coming in\/out of the the kitchen so we tried to squish in as best we could. Then we were addressed again with a \"you guys really need to move, that's not a request, you can't be here.\"\nThat and they were apologizing to the table beside our group but not us. I can understand the danger of crowding the path to the kitchen but the staff was rude and should have told our group that they couldn't accommodate them in the first place rather than handling it as they did.\nNeedless to say we left and won't be coming back.
