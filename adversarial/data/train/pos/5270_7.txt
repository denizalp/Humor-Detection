Etobicoke has very little in the way of redeeming qualities; after all it is the land that brought us Rob Ford. BUT in the back of a strip plaza off Queensway lies a little pie shop, making savoury pies so delicious that they are penance enough for all of  Etobicoke's sins. For the love of all that is holy get yourself to this god-forsaken land to try these pies, it will be worth your while, I promise. \n\nBeing in the area I decided to pop-in for lunch. The place is so hidden that I drove right by it, even with my GPS, so keep your eyes peeled for a small sign pointing you to the back of a plaza. The place is a hole in the wall with only three stools to sit and eat and some picnic tables outside. They serve a vast array of savoury pies, on this day I was feeling a little more conventional so I opted for the beer and beef pie with a side salad ($10 all in). Within one bite this became the best pie my lips have ever had the pleasure of tasting (savoury or otherwise). Crust so flaky and butter filled it will take years off your life, beef filling so flavourful, craft beer infused veal stock so rich without being too heavy, all in all the perfect lunch. Side salad was uninspired and probably came out of a box but with pies this good who cares? Despite the amazing buttery dough and meaty filling I did not feel gross or heavy afterwards, it was the perfect lunch portion.  \n\nThey sell pies fresh or frozen so if you want to pick up and take home some pies for another day that is an option. Their menu consists of an eclectic group of pies ranging from pulled pork, butter chicken, all the way south for a jerk chicken pie. They do have a couple of sweet options too but these guys are keeping things savoury for the most part. \n\nIn short don't walk to Etobicoke, RUN! And don't forget to bring me a pie ;-)
