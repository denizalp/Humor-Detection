WHY HAVE I NOT REVIEWED THIS?\n\nIt's retarded how much I've been here. It's always my go to spot after dinner or just to take someone for some coffee and desserts. I've been on a few dates here too, and brought family just to enjoy. Hell, last night I bumped into a friend there who mentioned that she only went to IS SWEET because I recommended it and always take great Snapchats. lmao. \n\nI just need to remember to always check in on yelp. I tend to forget because I go straight to the dessert and stare insanely at them. \n\nI've tried most, if not, all of their desserts. The tiramisu, the Hello Kitty strawberry cake, crème brule, bannofie pie, cheesecake, cute little bear face nutella mouse, the chocolate cake, and of course, their crepe cakes. I've also tried their waffle and their honey toast. \n\nDrink wise, I've had their caramel frappe, taro milk tea, mocha latte, and a couple others. \n\nI have not been disappointed! \nIt's a very comfortable ambience. Rustic, yet trendy. The music is always mellow or some sort of acoustic covers of top charted songs. It has plenty of seats, but it does get busy. A lot of people like the place and the brick wall look is where people always try to sit at. Great background for your picture taking needs! The lighting is somewhat dimmed, but still a lot of lighting at night. During the day, the sunlight hugs the place nicely.  \n\nThe presentation of the desserts and drinks are adorable to where you HAVE to take a pictures! So bring your camera's or have juice on your phone to take a ton of pics. Its funny, even though I've taken a bunch of pics of the desserts I've had, if I get the same dessert again, I still take pics! lol.\n\nAnyway, when Game (co-owner) is working and see's me, he already knows what I want. \"HEY!! Tiramisu?\" HAHAHAH! Love him! Every time I see someone walk in, I see him always smiling and welcoming anyone and everyone. Princess too! There's always great attitude in there! \n\n\n\nTop desserts:\nTiramisu (personal fave)\nMatcha crepe cake (Everyone's fave) \nCrème brule \/ Bannofie pie (Tied)
