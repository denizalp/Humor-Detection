Amazingly raunchy! \n\nI love dark humor, but it's not for everyone, as evidenced by some of the bad reviews. I will say that most of the jokes are pretty unoriginal (think racist and politically charged), but the delivery is what made them so hilarious. The venue is set-up like a carnival tent with the stage in the center so there isn't a bad seat in the house. I was running late due to heavy traffic and was worried I'd be turned away, but everyone was really nice and they promptly escorted me to my seat. All of the acts are superb, though Gazillionaire carries the show. The rain man pole dancer caught everyone's attention as well.\n\nThe highlight for me was getting to go on stage to judge two dudes attempt to give me a lap dance. I've always wanted to be picked to go on stage so that's one thing checked off my bucket list. Unfortunate that I have no photo proof of this life defining moment, but we all got some free alcohol out of it. The front two rows are prime for getting jokes thrown your way so if you're easily butthurt or offended, sit further back.\n\nOverall, a good mix of acts and humor. Loved every minute of this show.
