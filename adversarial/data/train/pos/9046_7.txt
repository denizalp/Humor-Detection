Everything seemed fine at first cuz I was in love with this Mazda3 I found there. The price was not that great and the salesmen wouldnt budge on the price even though the car had a cigarette burn hole I found a day late, a dent and the car made a noise they said will be fixed with two new tires which they gave me.. my biggest regret was not getting an extended warranty (GET THE EXTENDED WARRANTY!)\n All the problems started after the first month of having the car! The noise came back, the battery died after a month n a half of having the car! I called them n they told me good luck n they dont care. Then at my next inspectuon I found out they installed one of the tires BACKWARDS!
