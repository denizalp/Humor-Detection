Years of watching Arrested Development had me sold on seeing Blue Man Group during my latest stint in Las Vegas. For ~$109, a group of us scored pretty decent tickets to a weeknight show. I wasn't 100% what to expect outside of lots of blue paint, but it was a bit of a let-down once I sat through the show.\n\nTHE OVERVIEW.\n- $100+ per head seems waaaay over-priced for the show (yeah, the show is well produced, but not worth it in my opinion)\n- Woe is you if you know any of their audience tricks in advance, it definitely ruined things a bit for me\n- The acts got a little old very fast for me, unfortunately, and it felt like the show dragged on\n- The show is fairly audience interactive, which is good if you're into that\n\nIt wasn't an unpleasant experience, just a bit dull and pricey. I can't imagine people coming back to rewatch the show?
