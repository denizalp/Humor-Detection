I have never been so angry at a grocery store. The pork products are still good with fair prices, but the customer service at the front is horrendous. The lady actually was scolding and semi yelling at me because I wanted to come back and pay at seven because if the pastry deal (it was 630). I've done this countless times but this time one woman made a huge deal. I've done this before in front of the boss and it was ok. It was so disrespectful how they treated me. I'm also lucky I spoke Cantonese, I can't imagine how that would have turned out if I only spoke English. I am truly disappointed with this place today.
