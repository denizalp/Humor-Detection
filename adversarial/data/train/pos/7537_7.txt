I've been meaning to go here for nearly a year and never got around to it.  Nearly collapsing from hunger after getting off work late yesterday, I stumbled in here half an hour to closing.  I ordered the veggie sampler and had a chat with the owner, Ninos, while I waited for my food.  The complimentary lentil soup was delish and helped me survive the short wait until my food was ready.  Ninos is as awesome as everyone says - such a warm, friendly guy.  A real breath of fresh air with the way most businesses are these days.\n\nAs others have mentioned, the restaurant is pretty spartan, but it was very clean.  Some of those hole in the wall restaurants have tasty food but have you trying not to look too closely at the tables or study the grime engraved in the walls.  Definitely not the case here - it was very clean and bright.\n\nOn to the food.  I wasn't all that crazy about the potato cake, but it seemed like the distant Grecian cousin of shepherd's pie, which I can't stand.  That's just personal tastes, nothing against Good Fellas.  Otherwise, my food was very tasty.  The hummus had an unexpected yet delightful smoky hint.  The unexpected star of my meal was the boorack, a delicious pocket of dough stuffed with savory mushrooms and potatoes.  I've never had them before but loved them.\n\nI'd love to see a grilled veggie kabob added to the menu.  I was a little surprised that I didn't see one on the menu, although I was looking at the carryout menu and didn't double check the posting on the wall, so I'm not totally positive one hasn't been added.  In the meantime, I'll try to avoid buying a truckload of that boorack; I don't think my waistline would appreciate it.  ;)
