@AudreyRLWyatt and I ( @canyonjunkie ) met good @YelpPhx friends Heather C and Ryan C for dinner some time ago.  I really am remiss in catching up my reviews.\n\nI will try to do better in the future and as penance I will UFC several orange heads.\n\nAnyway, I'll cut to the chase and break down Vinci Torio's thus:\n\nDessert         5 stars\nDinner           3 stars\nService          4 stars\nAtmosphere   4 stars\n\nThat makes a total of 16.  Maybe someday I'll put together some sort of restaurant scoring matrix with weighted category rankings...\n\nGreat desserts, very good service and ambiance, the dinner entrees were good but did not wow me.
