I have been doing a lot of dropping off and picking up at Sky Harbor lately. I've been there about 6 times in the last 2-3 weeks. And since our local police force always seems to chase me out of the terminal when my party is not there, I end up at the cell phone lot. They have lots of parking available and a big sign to tell you when the flights arrive. In addition, it's easy ins and outs from the lot to the terminals.
