I'm not into baby stores quite yet, so that may reflect this review. Mostly, though, it was just the mediocre customer service. I walked up to pick up a baby shower gift on behalf of a friend, and I stood at the cash register and waited patiently for the clerk to give me her attention. All she said was, \"Hi.\" Granted, she was busy helping someone else, but that wasn't clear to me at the time, and she made no effort to let me know she or someone else would be right with me.\n\nAfter several agonizing minutes, the clerk finally addressed me with, \"Did you need help with something?\"\n\nNO I AM STANDING HERE BECAUSE I AM PURE CREEP SHOW. My eyes almost rolled to the back of my head permanently.\n\nInstead of being a sarcastic prick, I told the clerk I was simply there to pick up a gift on behalf of a friend. The clerk went behind a screen to some sort of storage area to ask someone for help. At this point, I was surprised she didn't ask for help earlier, given how long I was standing at the cash register. \n\nThen the clerk went to another back room on the other end of the story. Then she came back and asked me to spell the name.\n\nMaybe I was in a hurry. Perhaps I'm impatient by nature. I don't know. I just don't feel like I was managed very well from a customer service standpoint. What should have taken 30 seconds took nearly 10 minutes. I think I need to be Showered with Love or something.
