This is a TERRIBLE company and they lie to your about coming to your house to fix an appliance.  The appointed time was between 8m  - 10am.  When they weren't here by 10:30, I called to see if there was a problem.  No problem, just running a little late.  I called this company 4 times & was assured & promised that a tech would be at my.  No show,  no phone call & now I have to dispose of all frozen food in the freezer & some in the refrigerator.  \nWhy couldn't the just call me to say they wouldn't be able to make it??  I spent all day Sat. waiting for them. I find this inexcusable and I would advise everyone to find a different place to do business with.\nA VERY unhappy non-customer
