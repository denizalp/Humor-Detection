Eveything tastes better when deep fried?!\n\nDouble Rice Balls with Tomato Sauce ($7.95) and Panzerotti ($8) with Tomato Sauce ($1)\n\nDeep Fried goodness with cheese and sauce... Carb attack.\n\nThose are the 2 things I highly recommend getting at Ricci's.\n\nEnjoy and don't think about calories and fat content. You won't regret that!
