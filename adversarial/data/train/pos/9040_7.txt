The food is bomb. Atomic style. \n\nOk, it's not spicy at all, but it is freaking delicious.\n\nI had one hell of a goose chase trying to find some chinese food on this weeknight. It's past 9PM on a Monday, and I can't find anything decent. It's Scottsdale, so my only choices are: Panda Express in Mesa, Jimmy Woo's (no thanks, eww), or go hungry. I settled, and drove to KFC thinking that if I was going to settle for something other than Chinese, I could get a double down, and try and go all suicidal. \n\nThen KFC let me down by forcing me to wait 10 minutes because all their filets were frozen. Eff that noise. I drove around aimlessly and somehow stumbled upon Pita House. It was like a sight for sore eyes.\n\nI've lived in Scottsdale for just over a year. I've been out and about in the area quite a bit, but for some reason I've never actually been to the Pita House. Probably because it does look a little weird. \n\nI guess I shouldn't judge a book by it's cover, because this place was awesome.\n\nTonight, I ordered the Chicken Shawarma with an extra chicken skewer. It came with a side salad. I was pleasantly surprised to find a very thick garlic sauce (very similar to the one at Zankou Chicken in LA, see my review). Amazing. So garlicky, citrusy, and perfect.\n\nThe chicken was moist and juicy. The kind that makes you want to put your mouth all up in it. Mmm hmm. Yeah. It's very nice.\n\nMy meal was about 10 bucks. I devoured everything set in front of me. \n\nIf you are into Hookah, they have hookah specials from 4-9, and also, some sort of lunch special for Gyros.\n\nIf I wasn't moving away, I'd be here more often.\n\nNext time I am in Scottsdale, I will eat here, and grab some Falafel. Seems like people like it.\n\nLastly, the staff seems very nice. The guy who helped me (I think he was the owner) was super cool and friendly.
