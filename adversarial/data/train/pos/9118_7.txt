This place won't be open long. Went here because of the great reviews.\n\nThe good: Showed up  Friday night without a reservation, the host  Horus seated rather quickly Server was great explained the menu in great detail.\n\nThe bad: While waiting for our appetizers German Osio (the owner) came by to introduce himself. He was slurring his words and seemed drunk. During our meal we noticed German get into an altercation with a guest that was sitting close by.  German followed the guy outside. My girl was curious to see what happened so she stepped outside. She saw German choke the guy and then saw the guy punch German in the face knocking him out cold! The police and ambulance showed up it was a huge scene. For this guy to own two other restaurants in the valley he is highly unprofessional. I've never witnessed such animalistic behavior before, especially in Scottsdale. All in all food was mediocre but it might just have been the owners behavior that ruined our experience. I will NOT be back.
