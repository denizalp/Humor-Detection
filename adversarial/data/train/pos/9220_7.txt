Someone described this coffee shop as groovy. It is an apt adjective to use to describe this coffee shop.\n\nService was fast and both baristas were very efficient. In the space they work in they are able to make all the coffee drinks as well as toasted sandwiches.\n\nThe wall art is interesting and quite varied. For the Halloween season, there are couple of paintings of skeletons working hard. I am sure there is a political message hidden in them somewhere. \n\nI had a triple espresso con panna ($3.50) in a ceramic cup.  It packed a very smooth punch and was good to the last drop. If you enjoy a straight espresso, a con panna adds a little sweetness and doesn't overshadow the flavor. \n\nTheir drink sizes are interesting--short, tall, serious or extremely serious. \n\nIf you want a sandwich, grab a menu and mark what you want on it. Easy as pie!\n\nThis is definitely a great local alternative to Starbucks.
