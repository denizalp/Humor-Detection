I know other people have been raving about this place, but I don't really get it. AND I LOVE FRIED CHICKEN!  I'll get straight to the food, we got the 5 wing combo and the 2 boneless thigh combo.  The chicken was moist and the skin was crispy at least on the wings.  But there was a consistent lack of flavor in both the wings and the thighs.  I saw the famous seasoning dusted on the chicken, but it still lacked flavor.  The thigh and wing meat was also flavorless.  The wings are a better idea than the thighs.  The thighs are thick, meaning lots of flavorless chicken in between the fried coating.  And my thighs had a nice coating of oil\/grease at the bottom that soaked through the brown tray, leaving the skin on the bottom of the thighs soggy.  We did not have this problem with the wings.  A positive is the portion size, very generous portion of chicken and fries.  The fries were nice and crispy shoe string fries, but the cole slaw side was forgettable.  The saving grace for the chicken is the dipping sauces available at the table (chipotle honey, bbq, wasabi honey, honey, etc.)  But I feel like good fried chicken should be able to stand alone and that was not the case.  I might give this place another shot later on, but I was sorely disappointed on my first visit.
