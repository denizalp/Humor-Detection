I almost didn't stay to even find out how the food was because of the rude bald guy. I don't know if he's the host or an owner or a manager...I didn't see any kind of name tag or anything. We walked in, stood there for a bit, then bald guy greeted us. We asked for a table for 2. He replied \"Ok...it'll be a bit of a wait.\" We asked about how long. He replied \"I really have no way to tell\". Seriously?? I mean, restaurants of all types and sizes have been giving approximate wait times since the beginning of time. You can't give me a ballpark? 5 minutes? 5 hours?? Something??? I was parked at a meter and had already paid for an hour so I decided to wait at least a little longer since parking was paid for. Had I been in a free parking place, we would have left for sure. We sat on a bench out front behind an old guy with a big fake boob lady whose backs were facing us...he kept putting his thumb inside her panties and molesting her butthole. They continued inside the restaurant as well. I'm sure this entertainment helped us pass the time, but unfortunately they probably aren't there all the time so your wait might be more boring.\n\nThankfully bald guy wasn't our server. We got Britney (dunno if it's spelled right, sorry!). Britney was fantastic. She was friendly (which is something I wasn't expecting because of reading other reviews while waiting for the...maybe 15-20 minutes it took for us to get a table.) She made great recommendations and was very prompt and pleasant. She is the only reason I give 3 stars instead of 1 or 2.\n\nThe food was...decent. The bacon was kind of thick and floppy for my taste. I like crispy bacon, but to each his own. The special was decent, the waffle was edible but not great by any means. The hash browns were delicious and tasted like buttery mashed potatoes inside. It was stuff I'd eat again but wouldn't see myself craving and traveling across town for.
