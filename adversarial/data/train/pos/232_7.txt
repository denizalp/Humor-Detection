Lost track of my finances while my baby girl was in the newborn intensive care and managed to rack up like 10 NSF. Desert Schools refused to help our situation even though we explained. They had no sympathy to our situation. We have thousands in medical bills and now had this to worry about. Charging people 35 for for a dollar overdraft should be illegal. Thanks for nothing.
