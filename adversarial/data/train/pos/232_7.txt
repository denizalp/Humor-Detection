For my 1000th review, I decided to choose Chloe's Corner.  I've been here a few times and really enjoy coming here for breakfast on my day off.  Located in Kierland Common,  I love how convenient it is to a large parking lot and garage.....easy in\/out access.  I also love the counter seating option.....makes for a very quick meal and comfortable for dining alone.\n\nMy two favorite dishes here are the Chorizo and Egg Burrito, $6.00 and the Breakfast Sandwich (Eggs, Bacon, Mayo, Cheese), $6.50.\nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/jvnMR2D-YVtnQWCP4PN_kw?select=eHfPsCEtTbF1_xC8RoWe4A\nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/jvnMR2D-YVtnQWCP4PN_kw?select=1OXc4iFyfif-X4YZl0O2mw\nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/jvnMR2D-YVtnQWCP4PN_kw?select=fxHDSdlPpvOJXGviWzt1YA\n\nThey're both very simple dishes, but done very well.  The Eggs are prepared scrambled in both dishes with the right proportion of Meat.  Their homemade Salsa goes really well with the Burrito....I just wish it was spicier...although my tastes are on the spicier side than most people.  The portion size of these dishes are just right too, not too much and not too small....I don't need to order 2 dishes to feel full and 1 dish doesn't leave me feeling guilty.\n\nAs a bonus, the service here is great.  They're always friendly and spot on making sure my Coffee cup stays full or that I'm satisfied before they give me the check.  It's not one of those places that sets your check in front of you while you're eating.....it's one of my Pet Peeves when dining out.\n\nOverall, I really enjoy coming here.  I look forward to my next visit.\n\nReturn Factor - 100%
