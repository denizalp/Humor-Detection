Pan Asian- I'm feeling Hot Hot Hot \n\nI completely fell in love with some of the menu items and others I probably wouldn't order again. \n\nIn Love- Beef Pho was ridiculously good, the broth was well balanced we ordered a spice level of 3 and it was perfect. Basil Fried Rice easily the best fried rice I've had since moving to Vegas it wasn't dry and it was full of flavor spice level 4. Pad Thai was delicious we ordered a 4 but ended up adding additional chili powder and hot sauce. We should've ordered a 6 or a 7 but once again the flavors were oh soo good.\n\nTried but didn't love it- Tom Yum soup spice level of 2, this could be just me but something was very bland about this dish compared to my local joint. Gyoza, don't get me wrong it was good with a nice crispy exterior and moist filling but it wasn't amazing. Massaman curry spice level 4 we added lots more chili powder once again this was a great dish but it didn't stand out amongst the many other times I've ordered it. \n\nSide note- they were out of the mango sticky rice dessert. \n\nOverall I will definitely come back to order my favorites here and I'm not scared to kick up the spice level next time either. They keep the water coming during your meal so don't be skeered.
