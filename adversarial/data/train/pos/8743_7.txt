I told my coworker that I didn't want to write a [negative] review.  Perhaps this really IS good food and we just are ignorant?!?  \nNo, I owe it to Yelp to warn people about what the experience really is.\n\nFirst, there is NO ambiance.  This small restaurant is tucked into a mall\/retail area that is called J-town (Japanese).  I've been to Japan and it's not this shabby.  So this place is NOT suitable for business dinners or a date night, unless you want to relieve that small village feel of Japan.\n\nSecond, the menu is an abundance of the \"leftover\" parts of animals.  Liver? Check. Gizzards? Check. Bones? Check? Knuckles? (aren't those bones too?!?) Check.\n\nI wanted to order a char-grilled item to try, but the only thing I could eat was the waygu beef.\n\nMy coworker and I ordered what we knew, or what we thought we knew...\n-Edemame. Not that fresh or else it was over-steamed.  And where is the salt?!?\n-Agadashi-Tofu. Honestly, this was the best thing we had.  The broth had lots of tasty mushrooms.\n-Hamachi and Toro sashimi.  The yellowtail was fresher than then tuna, which was mushy and flavorless.\n-Spicy fried shrimp.  It was not that spicy, nor flavorful.  \nFinally, the \"dumplings\".  I guess we didn't that this is really \"fried chicken wings stuffed with pork\".  My coworker ate one.  I couldn't stomach trying it because of the feathers that we still on the fried wing.  So we left two of the three \"dumplings\" uneatened.\n\nThey serve most everything in three's.  Looking around, most groups were even numbers.  Do they want to cause more angst over food?
