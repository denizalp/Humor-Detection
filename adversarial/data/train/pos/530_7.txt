Went for one of their timeshare presentations today. We were told that we were just going to check out the property for no more than an hour and a half, that a nice breakfast was included, and that we would be back at the hotel by noon. Above all, they promised that there would be no pressure to buy anything, and that it was just a friendly tour to promote their new property. I should not have let myself get suckered in.\n\nFive hours later, we found ourselves still sitting in their waiting room, waiting for our \"gifts\". This, of course, is after being endlessly, uncomfortably pressured into buying a timeshare that we said multiple times that we were not interested in. Our tour guide was polite and understanding, but we were still pressured over and over again, told that we were missing out on a great deal. We were also promised a ride back to the hotel in a private limo, and were instead sent home in a bus.\n\nIt's now 5PM and we've just gotten back to our hotel, after leaving at 10AM. We went to exchange our vouchers for our show tickets. When I asked where the seats were located, the lady who signed us up for this terrible experience promised that the seats were toward the middle, in the green section. Our tickets are for the blue section, all the way up in the back and to the side of the stage.\n\nDo not fall for this. It is a complete waste of time. Go to tix4tonight - they'll get you better seats and you won't have to waste the last day of your vacation being bullied into buying a timeshare!
