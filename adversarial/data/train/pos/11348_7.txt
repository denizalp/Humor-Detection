The Hair Place leases the premises from Hart House.  The first review reads like an advertisement by management.  I just got the second worst haircut of my life there.  I walk past this place three times a week and thought it would be convenient to use it.  The day I entered there were two barbers and no customers.  Hence my shock at the careless haste with which the barber rushed my haircut.  The result was choppy and uneven and nothing like what I asked for.  I will return to my regular barber, who unlike The Hair Place, shaves your neck after a careful and skilled cut--and at the same price.
