I feel this business is unprofessional.  They completed work in my home, and without asking permission, went through my home and borrowed my own personal tools \/ equipment.  Moreover, they are very very pushy with payment.  They requested payment even before the work was complete.  Unfortunately, I made the mistake of paying them and the work remains incomplete.
