I still have dreams about bacon martinis thanks to the Double Down. PS, don't try making one at home!\n\nGreat for late night drinks and cool people. The ass juice is somewhat like jungle juice from college, but kicked up a notch. Am guessing the name has something to do with the fact that it kicks you in the ass...and you feel like ass the next day :)\n\nCan't wait to go back on my next trip to Vegas!
