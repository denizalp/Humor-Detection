Let me preface this with I don't really drink beer. We went for the food, even though my partner did order a beer, because the menu looked interesting.\n\nThe best things we ordered were the beer mac that came with my sliders and the gourgeres. Everything else was barely mediocre, some was just downright bad. \n\nFirst, our server was inattentive and disinterested. Our waters and my soda sat empty for way too long, and there was no attempt to even engage. It was just, \"are you ready to order? What do you want?\" \n\nI ordered the sliders, and got the pork belly, grilled cheese, and tri tip. The tri tip was ok, but not amazing. The cheese on the grilled cheese wasn't really melted, and was more of this partially melted, partially solidified glop of cheese, that was totally unappetising. But the pork belly... the pork belly was the biggest disappointment. I LOVE pork belly. Love it. But this literally made me nauseous. I don't know what it was. I don't know if the pork is frozen all breaded, then thrown in the microwave. All I know is that there was this awful chemically aftertaste that lingered. It reminded me of a weird microwave tv dinner, not crispy at all, and the pork was almost grey. I thought maybe it was the pickled onions, so i took those off and tried again. Nope. Tried scraping some of the massive amounts of goat cheese off. Nope. Definitely the pork. \n\nThe girlfriend got the Brewhouse Chicken sandwich, and she was only able to eat half of it. The chicken was dry, and the sandwich as a whole was just meh. \n\nSo my advice would be to NOT go if you actually want a meal. Go for the beer, and some of the appetisers. But seriously, just skip the actual food. We had really high hopes, and sadly this isn't a place we'll be going back to.
