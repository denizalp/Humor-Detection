One of my unwritten vacation rules is to never eat at the same place twice in the same trip. The fact that during a 3 day visit, I came here twice says a lot.\n\nAnyone who knows me knows that desserts and sweets are my reason for being. I would rather eat dessert than a meal nearly every time.\n\nThe pastries here are hand-crafted and beautiful. Typically when food is this eye-catching, it often looks better than it tastes.\n\nI'm happy to report that that wasn't the case here. During my 2 visits, I tried several beautiful as well as delicious items: A raspberry napoleon, a mini chocolate mousse, an eclair, and a mixed berry crÃªpe.\n\nEverything was divine, and as you can imagine, cost a small fortune.\n\nTheir coffee was quite robust and a perfect complement to the pastries. \n\nAll of my wonderful treats were enjoyed in the Chihuly glass atrium in the exquisite lobby.\n\nDefinitely a highlight of my visit and a must stop if you enjoy desserts as much as I do.
