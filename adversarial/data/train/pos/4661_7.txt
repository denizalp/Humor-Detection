The food here is delicious and a pretty fair price. Good falafel, hummus, and salads. My only issue with this facility is the service. I have been here several times and the staff is not attentive and doesn't communicate well. One of the times I went I ordered hummus but they didn't bring out any pita bread with it like the menu stated so I asked for it and the waitress said she would go get it but then stood at the front desk. After about 5 minutes I went to the counter (where she had been the entire time) to ask again she said \"yeah it's in the oven\" if she had communicated that initially I wouldn't have had to go to the counter asking for it... I felt like kind of a fool. I have had other issues with the service as well. The food is delicious so I will definitely return but probably only for takeout.
