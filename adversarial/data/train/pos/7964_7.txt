LONGER, WIDER, AND FASTER\n\nThat's one of the many things that the Canadian Football League has to offer, besides 3 Downs, an interesting kicking game, backfields in motion, lots of passing, last minute scoring, and a bunch of other rules that are different than the NFL. The first game I attended was the Calgary Stampeders vs. the Sacramento Gold Miners at Sac State in what turned out to be a failed CFL attempt to enter the US Market. That game was fast and fun, Doug Flutie was great, and I was hooked. \n\nMy Canadian friends who follow the CFL are either Calgary or Edmonton fans, of which I have been fortunate to watch good games in each of their Stadiums. The CFL rules require a little study, but it all makes sense within the first few minutes of play. So during a recent Calgary Stampeders home game I attended (vs. the Winnipeg Blue Bombers, led by QB Alex Brink), I was in my element, and properly attired in a Stamps Jersey thanks to my friend Jim. \n\nOne other key difference between the CFL and NHL is that the Canadian season starts in July and ends in November. I think that's to accommodate the weather that becomes a little more severe later in the season. I particularly remember a September game once that started out on a warm Indian Summer Day. Sometime in the 2nd Quarter, a \"Blue Norther\" came in, dropped the temperature at least 30 degrees, and then it began to rain. This Iowa Boy had never seen anything like it, and all I wanted was more.
