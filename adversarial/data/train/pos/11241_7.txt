With a name like BACON it better be good! \n\nI saw this place a couple weeks ago and thought I'd go give it a try. \n\nI liked the inside, it was pretty casual with big comfy denim booths and red checker table cloths. \n\nThey serve breakfast and lunch, the menu looked good (not that actual menu mind you, it was just a sloppily thrown together piece of photocopied paper). I was hoping for the best. \n\nSo they don't have diet coke......... \n\nI order the BLT+2 fried eggs breakfast sandwich, (see pics) \nThe menu says its served with home fries and baked beans.............. \nI got no beans. \n\nEverything looked wonderful as you can see..... \nThe potatoes were awful and I was bummed, they tasted very very old. \n\nSeriously what's your name again BACON? \n\nI should be biting into the tastiest most succulent bacon to ever grace the lips of anyone but unfortunately this BACON was the most flavorless lackluster BACON on the planet. \nThe whole sandwich was just so bland, I found myself reaching for the salt shaker and I NEVER put salt on my food. \nOh and Please don't put old soggy tomatoes on my sandwich again, Thanks. \n\nI hadn't eaten after my workout and a few errands I had to run so I obviously ate the sandwich, not the potatoes though, but I Still cant get over the fact of how it had no flavor.\n\nFor now I'll have to say 2.5 stars,  like the old saying goes, you never get a second chance to make a first impression.\n\nBut to be fair I would possibly go again and try something from the lunch menu because honestly this place has tons of potential and room for improvement, I hope they succeed
