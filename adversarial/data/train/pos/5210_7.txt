If you're looking for a full-service bakery, the way it's done old-school, then this is your place.  They serve every baked good you can think of, and if they don't have it, you can certainly special order it.   However, their selection is huge so I doubt you'd be special-ordering.\n\nI go here because it's on my way to my mother-in-law's, and it's always nice to bring a sweet surprise to her.   I would love to have a bakery like this where I live (East side of town). \n\nAlso, there's no aftertaste like you might experience at a grocery store bakery.  It is soooo very delicious.  Staff is certainly friendly too.\n\nWarning, especially to first-time visitors:  I usually go in the bakery with one thing in mind, but end  up leaving with a few more items.
