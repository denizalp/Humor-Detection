I felt compelled to write this review.  \nI want to commend and thank the Scottsdale Police and their dispatchers, at this location, for their polite and fast service to the community.  \nOver the last several years, I have (unfortunately) had to call the police on more than one occasion to report vandalism and a neighbor who left their dog outside to bark all day and night.  \nIn both instances, the dispatchers were very informative as to when an officer would arrive and the officers themselves, were quick to arrive (less than 5 minutes) and really very helpful and personable, taking their time dealing with the issues.  \n\nThank you Scottsdale Police.
