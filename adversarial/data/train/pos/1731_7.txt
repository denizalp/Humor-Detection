This is for the review of the Donut and Beer tasting that the restaurant had in March. \n\nShockingly, I was horrified by the prospect of beer and donuts..had my new restaurant crush lost its' ever livin' mind?  Au contraire, mon frere, I think not! Honestly, Dunkin Donuts needs to install a tap and get the beer flowing or better yet, Il Vinaio's amazing maestro in the kitchen can teach the world a thing or two about pairing flavors! \n\nChocolate donuts with oatmeal stout and ricotta fritters and hefeweizen are awesome, not like \"Dude, this is so awesome\", more like the melding of flavors made the sky open and I was one with the almighty, Awesome. yeah, that kind of awesome. Il Vinaio's knows its flavors and I am now a true blue believer in donuts and beer, a meal for any time of day.
