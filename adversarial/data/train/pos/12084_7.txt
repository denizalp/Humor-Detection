My favorite brewery! From the quality of the beer, to service, to the atmosphere.. everything is top notch! \n\nFor the past year, it has been a routine for my girlfriend and me to stop by here for a brew when we first get into town. And in each visit, the bartenders and owners are always welcoming even if they are about to close. \n\nTheir beer variety comes with a lot of creativity but always keeps a strong balance. I've tried most of the options on their list and can honestly say I haven't had a bad beer. From their signature tap, I really enjoy the El Hefe.. strong jalapeno spice but still has the sharp hef taste. The Simply Stout is probably one of the best stouts I've ever had. It's easier to drink than Guinness and has a great malty taste. \nEvery visit, they always have a new concoction\/experiment that never fails. Some notable brews: Apple Cinnamon Brown, PB & Chocolate Stout, & this wheaty Stout. \n\nThe service is always great.. all the guys welcome you & give you a heads-up of what's new with the brewery. My dude, John is an excellent bartender. He knows the fine details of each brew and runs back and fourth to converse with each party.  One of the owners, Mark(the UFC fighter looking guy) is very humble and appreciates every customer trying their beers.\n\nIf you have the time while in Vegas and are just looking for some fine craft beer, Banger will never disappoint!
