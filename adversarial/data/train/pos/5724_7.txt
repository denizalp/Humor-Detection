Finding a Brazilian spot with authentic dishes that doesn't involve huge peices of meat being walked around is a Lil more difficult than u would think.  \n\nTucked away in the back of a little plaza this gem of a place originates home cooked Brazilian food. We were greeted by a very friendly lady and seated right away. She welcomed us and asked if we had been there before. We said we hadn't and then she went on to explain the menu and what was popular. \n\nCheese bread, incredibly good. Try it!! Got to try the Pastels (a fried pastry witg meat) and Coxhinas (fried potato with mixings) traditional dishes. They were really tasty. Guarana soda is like a sweet ginger ale.
