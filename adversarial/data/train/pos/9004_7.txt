Really cool library!! Who knew Scottsdale had a modern library since most of the style here is dessert country!! Love the cafe inside this library. She was really cool to chat with. Best part, it's located near the plaza park so after reading, you get to enjoy the nice fountain and maybe even see a family of ducks!\n\nUntil then, Cheers! ~ :p
