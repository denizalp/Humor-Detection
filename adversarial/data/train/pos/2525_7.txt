Bro tbonez is so lit. I went here a week ago with my boys after we smashed a bless up session at the gym. It was around 1 am on a Monday morning  and everywhere else was closed. Good thing bout t bones is that it's open 24\/7 #blessup. K so we got to tbonez and I was wondering what to get. The Guyanese waiter came out to take our order so I asked her what's good and she replied everything LOL. she was mad friendly\/funny I would LOWKEY come back just for her. Anyways I got a steak burger with onion rings and it was honestly so bless like. The steak was moist. Which is hard to expect from a steak burger and with the price point it's definitely a place to be recommended. 5\/5 will come again.
