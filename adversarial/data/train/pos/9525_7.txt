3 stars is as good as any fast food gets in my book, so I only rate the ones I think worth 3. That being said, I stopped in here for the first time because I had a coupon for a 2 for one deal. I got the Ultimate bacon cheeseburger. This is a double patty stacked on a bun with 2 kinds of cheese and 3 strips of bacon. My order was up fast, (well it IS fast food). this is one of the best fast food burgers I've had. One was enough to fill me up. I had one for lunch and the other for supper. I will be watching the flyers for more coupons.
