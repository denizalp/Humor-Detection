Have you ever gone eight hours without eating - totally looking forward to an awesome meal to satify your hunger?  Well Smokey Bones is not that place.  \n\nThe food was absolute crap. I take that back. I suspect crap tastes better than the food here.\n\nService was crap also. I had to get my own set of utensils and napkins. \n\nOn my bill, I drew a middle finger instead of leaving my signature on it.
