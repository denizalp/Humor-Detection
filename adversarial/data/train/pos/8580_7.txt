I finally received a call from the office manager Becky today.  One of the RUDEST people I have ever met.  She stated that as far as she was concerned there was no malpractice on their part and that was that!!!!  I asked her why I was charged for a dental cleaning when the tooth I had specifically asked to be taken out that was infected was not.  She had no answer.  I asked why I was charged \"Xray Restraints\" when my dog was under anesthetic at the time of X-ray - she replied \"Oh they must have forgotten to take that off\"   NO BECKY - they ADDED it on to my bill.  They also added \"Xray Handling\"  and Xray Reading\" to my bill.  Along with \"waste disposal\" which must have been for the few teeth that \"fell out\" while they were in there that they forgot to tell me about.    Just like they forgot to tell me to take off the dogs leg bandages so it wouldn't swell and get infected overnight..... or they forgot to tell me that my 15 year old dog may have a VERY serious problem due to his ALKP blood test coming back at 2000 instead of the normal read of 50..... guess they forgot that too Becky....\n\nIn my honest opinion - this vet runs a Bait and Switch scam, selling Dental Packages for $199 and hitting up customers for hundreds if not thousands more.  They don't even have a Dental Xray machine on premises and are running a dental clinic for animals.  \n\nSHAME ON YOU SEVEN HILLS PET HOSPITAL SHAME ON YOU.
