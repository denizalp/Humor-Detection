This is for the breakfast buffet only, which I had this summer.  Really people?  You're whining about a 5.99 buffet?  Some people are just tightwads that want something for nothing, are fat and gotta gorge themselves by tasting every damn thing the buffet offers then complain about one item, or chronically hating the world.  I had a mushroom and cheddar omelet, breakfast potatoes, sausage and fruit.  All fresh and good and only 5.99!  Sure I could've had another round, but why, I was full and satisfied.
