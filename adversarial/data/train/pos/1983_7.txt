You know all those young, heavily-tattooed, hipster Food Network chefs you see on every edition of Chopped? Apparently, they all end up here. And that's not necessarily a bad thing, particularly if you like your deviled eggs topped with caviar, and your pressure treated ceiling joists left unpainted. It's a pretty damned cool spot with design influences galore.\n\nThe food is what you would expect from young, heavily-tattooed, hipster Food Network chefs: Tater Tots with spice, meat with coffee stuff rubbed all over it, shitloads of bacon. But hey, it tastes good, it's nicely presented, the prices are reasonable, and the environment--in the right company--feels artsy and hip and cool. So put on your Joy Division t-shirt, drop your parents off at the Wynn, pick up your weird cousin and enjoy. The burger alone is worth a visit.\n\nDrinks alert!!! Mixed drinks are strong and interesting. Wine list is uninspired, overpriced, served in water glasses, and meager.
