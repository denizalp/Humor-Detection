Krispy Kreme! Oh yes please!! I needed my donut fix, Super happy staying at Planet Hollywood hotel & casino, this Krispy Kreme location popped up when I did a Yelp search, which was the closest one. I was about to go the Excalibur location. \n\nFinding this location was simple,  \nExit strip side of Planet Hollywood go up the stairs to your left and its in the same area as Walgreens, walk in further and you will see Krispy Kreme. There are other eateries here, ex. Panda Express. \n\nThis Krispy Kreme is fairly new, opened in 2017 per cashier. I loved the look of this Krispy Kreme shop. The digital screens on the wall are so cool, you can see all the Krispy Kreme photos posted by customers via social  media. \n\nIt is a tradition, every visit to Vegas, that I must stop by for Krispy Kreme donuts. I got 2 large coffee and 6 glazed donuts for me and my other half. The glaze donuts were hot, fresh, and so soft, just as I remembered it. The coffee went so good together. I also got the mini donuts in the plastic cups, I don't care for them, it was way too sweet & didn't taste fresh. As I am enjoying my coffee and donuts, I am wishing that I could be on vacation forever, life is wonderful!! \n\nUntil next time Krispy Kreme!! Thank you for my donut fix!
