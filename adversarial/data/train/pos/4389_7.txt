Holy bull riding batman! Here are some updates since my last review. \n\nBe sure to visit Buffalo Chip Saloon on Friday nights. The professional live bull riding makes it worth the drive, trust me. \n\nSince my last visit, they've built an entirely new edition to the Saloon where they serve the famous BBQ buffet. It's very nice and makes for a good place to sit and eat! \n\nI just love it here. This place is definitely what you would think AZ looks like if you lived elsewhere and had never been to Arizona, but sometimes even the locals need a little tourist social night in their life!
