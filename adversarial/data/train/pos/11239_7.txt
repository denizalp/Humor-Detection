I've had a late breakfast and two more happy hours since my last review update!  \n\nFirst, my late breakfast consisted of one stuffed pancake off of the side menu- peach creme brulee.  This actually first arrived as a plain pancake w\/ a generous pour of creme brulee sauce w\/ a dash of powdered sugar- something I specifically asked not to have added.  So, another pancake was whipped up, and again, I received a plain pancake, but this time w\/ only a very thin layer of creme brulee sauce (sob!).  The missing peaches, lovely when stuffed into the batter while cooking, were added as a warmed side.  Strange that I was charged extra for a serving of creme brulee sauce when the corrected pancake was so lacking in sauce to begin with, but whatever.  I should've been more outspoken about it...\n\nSecond, I tried the gladiator burger and subbed chorizo mac 'n cheese for the fries (extra $1.50 for a total of $7 for the burger and mac).  I preferred this burger over the Daily Dose burger I had previously, and while the chorizo mac 'n cheese was tasty, it just isn't as good as that of Crust's Crusted Mac 'n Cheese!  Strange, that, since DD's version contained chorizo, which packed a powerful punch in the flavor department...\n\nThird, I tried the chicken nachos, but instead of the corn tortilla chips, I opted for a flour tortilla wrap.  Not a problem according to my server and the manager on duty (who were very amiable).  I would order this chicken wrap again in a heartbeat!\n\nNext time I will throw caution to the wind and have one (or more!) of their famous sangrias!
