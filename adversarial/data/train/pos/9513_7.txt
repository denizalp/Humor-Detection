This is the place to be during their Presidents' Day sale. I don't know how it is the rest of the year but during that sale are intensely good.\n\nLoved the service we received! The woman said she was from ca, just helping out and she was amazing. She asked what woods we liked, styles and what we were looking at price wise. \n\nEnding up falling in love with a six seater shaped like a triangle! So weird but loved it. We have to save up for it though because it's a little pricy but worth it. We looked at other stores and their price was best for all it came with.
