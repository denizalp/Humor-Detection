I was very curious to see what they would sell here at this store and found it to be full of merchandise of self promotion and a small selection of sports memorabilia mainly in part due to Bruce Jenner and Lamar Odom.  I wanted to find something fun and functional and ended up purchasing a deck of cards for $20 with the famous Kardashian sisters printed on each card.  I think the store would be great for those who just want to look and reminisce of the \"Keeping Up With The Kardashians\" reality TV show, but the items are more of a novelty with a high price.  Beware of the security guard who stands in front of the store and doesn't allow photos to be taken inside.  If any of the Kardashians or Jenners read this review, please note that I am a fan, but not of this store.
