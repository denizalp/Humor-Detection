\"We can attest, arrange\n\"We can assess, we can attain\n\"We are the intrical entities\"\n\n------------------------------------------\n\nIn A Sentence™\nThey have chicken (in the form of strips), they are friendly (in the form of they might get their asses fired if they are not overtly faux friendly), and their sweet tea might give you type-II (if you drink it). \n\nQuick Review™\n+ Chicken is good*. Toast is good**. Sweet tea is good***. \n(*But isn't all chicken?) (**But isn't all buttered toast?) (***But isn't all sweet tea, until you have diabetes that is.)\n\n- Caniac® Club card is practically useless. Big negative! (\/Trump)\n\n------------------------------------------\n\nIt is a chain and therefore the food offered should be the same here as everywhere else the company operates. We're not here to discuss the food ....\n\nAlthough, I must mention here [and in every Cane's review] that the coleslaw is close to inedible. You may think the truth may vary on this account; however, you will be finding that you are sorely mistaken. Coleslaw's nasty. (I bet Cane wouldn't even eat that shit!)\n\nWhat are we here to talk about then if not the food? \n\n------------------------------------------\n\nFood\nI lied. I'll discuss some food. This is Yelp® after all! There are a couple of things we can count on around here (Yelp): people who have no business belonging to the \"Elite\" fraternity will be in there, HQ is comprised of incompetent, minimum-wage earning goons who are forced to eat plain rice every day just to continue living, and there will be food (discussed). I digress. \n\nStrips and a few sides is all they have. If you don't know this already, you might have been raised in a cave, or Alaska (same difference). Strips, fries, the damn 700 calories or so toast, coleslaw that is not fit for mammal consumption, et. cetera. \n\nStrips are better than other chains. Sandwich made of strips is better than other chains. Sweet tea compels you to get up from your seat multiple times to refill. \n\nService\nThe service at this Raising Cane's is exceptional for a fast food chain. They are usually so friendly, they might even inch out In-N-Out Burger® for the crown as friendliest service in this category. They take care of you when they mess up. \n\nCustomers\nIt is so packed here at all times one would imagine that the food is free (or there is no other restaurant in all of Northtown)!\n\nFirsthand experiences: I rode in the back of a motor vehicle filled with dudes -- no, not farm hands but dudes in the colloquial sense -- and walked in through the doors. I stood in queue. I ordered a sandwich. I paid with a Chase® Credit Card. I filled a cup to the top with sweet tea. I went into the restroom (men's) to wash my hands. The restroom was clean and well serviced despite the immense busyness of the restaurant. I washed my hands. I sat back down. I waited for a short period after that (approximate one minute) to be called, retrieved the tray (with sandwich), filled two little cups with ketchup, sat down, and begin eating. I ate. Et. cetera.\n\nPro Tip: \nThey offer military\/service\/uniform discount for those uniformed. \n \n------------------------------------------\n\nTourists: none here+. (+Except when they are driving up the 15 towards Utah and decide to get off to acquire some nourishment in World Famous Northtown.)\n\nKids: good for them. \n\nDogs: good for them++. (++I think there is outside seating and I am pretty sure Cane was a fucking dog, so ....)\n\n------------------------------------------\n\nRating: Three-stars, \"A-OK.\"\n\nIn Memoriam \nCane, the dog\n(Unk. - Unk.)
