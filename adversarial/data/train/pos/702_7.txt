SO UPSET. On the website it said WITCH was playing at 8:35 and so me and my friends meet up at the theatre to see it. It's 8:15 and we look at the times..... 8:35 was not there the next one wasn't until 10:40 and no way we're we going to wait 2.5 hours for the next viewing. \nWe asked the girl at the ticket stand why they were different and showed her the website.\nShe could care less. All she did was say \" ohhh uhhhh I wouldn't know.....\" \nShe didn't try to figure it out or ask anyone she just brushed us off and awkwardly stood there so we left and I don't know if and when I'll ever come back since I won't know what time movies ACTUALLY start.\n\n\nCall before you go to his theater so you don't get stuck like us.
