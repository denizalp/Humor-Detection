I should take a picture of these wings. Disgusting. I got the ones without the sauce. They looked like little rawhide doggie chews. I'm not even exaggerating. The cheese was weird and the BBQ chicken pizza was horrible. What is worse is that I had too wait what seemed like a long time. It looked like it was all high school kids working there. \n\nI like the Barro's on 7th St and T-Bird. Completely different. Way better. This one is nicer inside but the food is bad. I'm sure they can fix all this. It's just too nice a place.\n\nMessage me if you want to see those nasty wings.
