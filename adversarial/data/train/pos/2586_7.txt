This requires little thought.\n\nOne of the most depressing airports I have ever been to in my life.  Hung over rapist bachelour party douches slumped in their seats of misogny mixing with mindless losers that knew the odds and thought they might be the one... going home with an empty wallet, reeking of smoke, and sitting on their worthless asses.\n\nWow.  Harsh.
