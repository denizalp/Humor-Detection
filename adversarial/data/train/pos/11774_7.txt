Here's my review of Ping Pong Thai.  \n\n3 Stars for Service:\nWe were seated right away and the restaurant was clean.  My issue is the lack of service that we received once we placed our order and got our food.  My advice...order an extra glass of water or maybe two extra.  Once you get your food, you'll never hear from them again until your bill arrives.  \n\n3 Stars for the Ambiance:\nThis place is small and since there are a lot of people that dine here for lunch, you also feel cramped.  It's loud and a decent conversation with friends while you're eating shouldn't be expected.  Come to think of it, I think it's my friends that were the loud ones.  Regardless, don't expect any QT with your party if you eat here. \n\n3 Stars for the Food:  I got their Beef\/Broccoli w\/Brown Rice and a side of their Satay Chicken. The beef and broccoli was a bit salty with the highlight being the broccoli.  As for the Satay chicken, this is not something that I would order again.  Lacked taste and the portions were small.   \n\n4 Stars for Price: They got this part right.  Lunch for 3 costs about $30, which is a great price.  Portions, except their Satay Chicken, are huge.  \n\nMy friends are fans because they work in the area.  That also probably means that I will be back.  However, I'm not a fan.  The service and food is just A-Ok.  Note to self...stay away from their Satay Chicken.
