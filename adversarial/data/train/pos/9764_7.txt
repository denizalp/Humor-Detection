I've been looking for a cut and polished citrine ring for a while as a gift and a friend of mine mentioned they had seen one here for around $350. I thought I would check it out and see if I liked it. I walked in to the store - which is about the size of a living\/dining room in a converted house so it's not huge - and even though the counter is facing the door and the door can be heard\/seen being opened, the girl working had her back facing me and did not acknowledge me at all. No hello, no sneeze, no grunt, no glance in any general direction other than her computer.\n\nWell the good news is I found the ring and it was gorgeous. I would have gladly paid the $350 for it on the spot. The bad news is, this girl working apparently didn't want my money. Or maybe she did. If she had turned around even once from shopping for TV stands on the ikea website AT ALL, she would have seen me milling around that pretty jewlery case that contained all those wonderfully expensive items and maybe we would have known if she wanted the sale. \n\nI was going to pipe up and ask for help, and then it hit me. I work in retail. In a shop about that size actually. And when someone walks in, I put down my iphone, or my book or crossword and I say hello. I tell them to let me know if they need anything and then let them do their thing. It's common courtesy and customer service. Plus she was clearly so engrossed in her home furnishing needs that she was able to pretend myself and the other 2 people in the store didn't exist, I didn't feel right interrupting her.\n\nSo instead, I put back the greeting card I was holding to go with my $350.00 ring and took my money (with love) to another establishment. I wonder if $350 would have been enough to buy an ikea TV stand? I guess she'll never know.
