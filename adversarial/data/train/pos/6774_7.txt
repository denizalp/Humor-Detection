All white place. Didnt see a single colored person besides me. The tacos were bland. You save only a dollar on taco Tuesday. Not worth $2. All they have is corn tortilla, no flour option.\n\n Also, got their \"pigs in a blanket\" hotdog, originally known as a sonoran dog. It was the WORST hotdog I've ever had. The weiner was burnt, like charred. The hot dog itself wasn't even an expensive hot dog. It tasted like the Bars hotdog you get at the grocery store for $1. The bacon was burnt on the dog AND it was in a TORTILLA LIKE A TACO?! Never in my life I've seen such blasphemy done to a sonoran dog. I asked the server if I could get another one cause it was burnt looking and she hesitated to take it back. The new one i got was a little better only because the hot dog wasn't burnt. \n\nThey also charge $10 for the top shelf tequila when the bottle itself is only $60\/70. Rip off.\n\nNever coming back here again. Save your time and money!
