Tucked away behind Auto Zone, its intimate and simply-decorated space reminds me of casual eateries in Hawaii. We were seated in front of the restaurant where it was quite warm, but at least the sun did not pierce through the windows as it set. There is a good-sized menu that has already changed since the opening a couple months ago. There is a \"Today's Specials\" menu that changes frequently (not all items change daily). We had a pleasant time with the restaurant's sole server, Tokiko, as she was polite, friendly, and attentive.\n\nAs is popular of late, Yuzu features small plates for sharing. The prices are decent, however, there are a few items that are a little more of a splurge. We shared 14 dishes between three people and it came out to $50\/person with tax and tip. Some prices have already increased since opening. Four dishes really wow-ed me while the others were just okay. The only dish I disliked was the Yuba Sashimi. It was gooey, slimy, and offered nothing in the flavor department.\n\nMy favorite dishes:\n\nHalibut Carpaccio ($11.95): The ikura was a nice compliment and the yuzu\/basil sauce was really tasty. The dish was refreshing and very flavorful. I could eat plate after plate.\n\nHousemade Zaru Tofu ($5.50): I love fresh tofu and this was no exception. A must-have during every visit.\n\nYuzu Special Roll (4\/$16): Tamago, salmon, yellowtail, scallop, oyster, avocado, ikura, shrimp, radish sprouts, pickled radish (cut into a star), and sushi rice with chive, sesame, and oba. This dish is well worth the cost for the amount of seafood you get on each piece. It's also very beautiful and equally delicious!\n\nYuzu Sorbet ($2): This was surprisingly my favorite dessert! Refreshing and a delicate citrus flavor.\n\nRuben and I weren't overly impressed, however, I would visit again JUST for the Yuzu Special and I definitely want to try the beautiful Chirashi Bowl!
