I recently joined this YMCA after being a member at an upscale gym (Total Woman) for 10 years. I really did not think I was going to like working out at the \"Y\" at all. However, I was pleasantly surprised to find there is a great selection of free weights, Nautilus equipment, and various other machines.\n\nWhat's also great is there are several work out floors\/rooms, and they offer a variety of classes. Mostly snowbirds and retirees work out at this location. However, there are some young people working out there too!\n\nThis would be a great option for a family or a family with kids\/teenagers, as they have a pool, pool table, and shuffle board at this location. In my opinion, the best part of this gym is the mellow vibe. Everyone is cool and for females you won't have to worry about having unwanted males interrupting your set. However, you may still encounter some \"old dudes\" checking out your form!
