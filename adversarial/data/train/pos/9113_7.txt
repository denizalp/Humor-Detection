\"Everything you say\n\"Is just a lie\n\"And now I'm leaving\"\n\n------------------------------------------\n\nIn A Sentence™\nWorst Honda® dealership and repair shop in Las Vegas and possibly on planet Earth.\n\nQuick Review™\n+   N\/A. No positive attributes.\n\n-   They will lie to your face. They will overbill you based on those lies. They will overcharge you for services which are not even remotely required.\n\n-   They don't even possess the decency to comp you a shitty exterior car wash when charging you 4,000$ for a new used engine.\n\n------------------------------------------\n\nStorytime™\nI bring my motor vehicle here. Towed it from pretty far away in fact, based on expectations of superior professional technical work. Four dimes for an engine switch. It leaves a sour taste in your mouth; however, one has to accept the realities of life. I cannot construct a fucking engine and I certainly cannot put it in myself. \n\nNot really my biggest proverbial beef here because I return. I get quoted 600$ for some potential parts and work by their service department during a routine point-by-point inspection. It ain't no thang because I am no rush (after waiting around all day for them to come up with what supposedly wrong with my motor vehicle), so I take the document with me. I hand it to this one guy on probation\/parole (one of those) who can be trusted more than Honda West. \n\nMy guy looks at the paper, proclaims that most of it is bullshit, and goes to work. We get the parts at Auto Zone® on Charleston\/Maryland. Long story short: it's less than 200$ inclusive of parts\/work and that included paying him for removing a part that he just put back in because there was nothing wrong with it, unlike what Honda West was claiming.  \n\nI don't like being lied to. It's one thing to take advantage of a patron by being an overcharging crook; however, straight up billing for completely concocted deficiencies\/repairs is taking it a few fucking steps too far. From the unethical to the criminal.\n\nFinal word™\nI wouldn't even repair a burned-out taillight here. \n\n------------------------------------------\n\nTourists\nNot good for tourists*. (*Unless a tourist wants to get towed over 10 kilometres from the strip corridor.)\n\nKids\nNot good for kids*. (*Kids can't earn enough to cover these potential invoices.)\n\nDogs\nNot good for dogs*. (*Unless it's Honda Certified driving-paw dog.)\n\n------------------------------------------\n\nRating: One-star, \"Meh. I've experienced better.\" (When a probationer\/parolee is far more trustworthy ....)
