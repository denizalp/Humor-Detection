Get your gas here before leaving Vegas. It's $1 cheaper than the gas at Primm and Baker!!! Gas lines here can be long, especially on holidays and special events in Vegas that draws in tons of people. Grab some drinks here also, as they are much cheaper than drinks at the CVS and Walgreens on the strip!! We are talking like half the price of what is charged on the strip! I ALWAYS get gas here before taking off from Vegas. \n\nThey even have some machines here for you to play on if you didn't get enough of your fix at the casinos. They are all poker\/blackjack machines. \n\nStop here for some cheaper gas!! Your wallet will thank you and you'll have some extra funds for your next Vegas trip!
