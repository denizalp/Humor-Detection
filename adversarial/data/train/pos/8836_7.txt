This mall is a cesspool filled with wannabe Californians who think they are some billionaires. Their food court only has overpriced stuff and all the overpriced  places like five guys and paradise bakery. Probably because all these rich kids are starving themselves. This place is so big that trying to go from one end to the other is like going on a 10 mile run for cancer! This is the poor mans Beverly Hills mall with hipsters and leather skinned old rich ladies. Go to chandler or paradise valley for a good mall...
