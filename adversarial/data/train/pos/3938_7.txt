This cafe is the gem of Tuscany suites and casino. First of all, I love staying at Tuscany because it is super close to the strip, very cheap compared to the hotels on the strip, & extremely spacious!! So much room to fit huge parties.\nAnd of course it has Marilyn's cafe. I'm pretty sure this place is open 24\/7. They are known for their steak and eggs and it is under $10 I think! So cheap!!! It comes with some toast and hash browns as well! Pretty delicious, I mean of course it isn't some fancy steak but it definitely does the job for your late night hunger after the club!\n\nI usually always order the steak and eggs but today I decided to try something else. They have a pretty large variety of items including breakfast and I was definitely in the breakfast mood so I decided to get a vegetarian omelette, a blueberry pancake, and a banana pancake. Yes, I definitely ordered with my eyes.\n\nThe wait was kind of long for the food.... but once it came I legit vacuumed my food up!!! Everything was delicious! Our server was also very friendly and delivered excellent customer service.\n\nI would recommend the steak and eggs for sure and after what I tried today, I'm sure there are other great items too!
