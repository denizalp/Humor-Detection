By far some of the best customer service at any auto zone. They have always exceeded my expectations and have been able to help me with whatever I needed.\n\nReturns are easy and painless. I bought the wrong part and returning it was a breeze. Lifetime brake pads? Yeah, that's easy too. Pay for the new pads, return the old pads when you take them off and get your money back. This auto zone is always my go to for anything car related.
