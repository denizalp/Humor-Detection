This Tim Hortons is the closest one to my home. I would guess that it would take me five minutes to walk there.\n\nI remember when this Timmy's-Wendy's combo store used to be nothing but land. I feel like I am in my sixties, rocking in my wooden chair, recounting days gone by. As an undergraduate, Timmy's used to be where the Midland 57 bus would turn around. These days, it does a rather elaborate loop around the block before it parks right in front of Timmy's, on Midland Avenue, just south of Steeles. It's perfect for bus drivers wanting a break.\n\nAs for me, I rarely visit here. I am not a regular Timmy's person, but I do like to stop by now and again.\n\nI was here to meet someone. He was planning on buying my beloved cell phone that I have had for two years and have since upgraded.\n\nI always feel odd about meeting in such a place and not buying anything. I was thirsty and bought an iced green tea. It was cold and refreshing on a hot, humid day. It was a good $2.48 spent.\n\nMy buyer texted me. I found him sitting by the window, introduced myself, and showed him my case with all the accessories that I had.\n\nTimmy's is a good place to test out a phone. He connected to the wifi. He placed his SIM card in the phone and went crazy testing. I was fine. I kept sipping my drink, chatting with him, answering any questions he had, and relaxed.\n\nThis place gets busy. Most sitting there were Timmy's customers. Wendy's didn't have much of a lineup at 10 am. All tables were taken.\n\nThe drive-thru said the same thing. Timmy's had about ten cars. Wendy's had none.\n\nThe transaction was a success. My phone is going to a good home. I wished him a good day, left the crowded interior, and headed to my car.\n\nThe drive-thru line was in front of my car, which was the last car closest to the exit on Midland. I was smart to have backed my car into the spot. Pulling out was simple, especially when a nice person gave me the space to do it.\n\nI would come here, but not when it's hot and sunny at 10 am. Perhaps, I will do a night visit to see how busy it gets at that hour.\n\n(154)
