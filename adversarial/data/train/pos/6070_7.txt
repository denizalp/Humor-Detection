I ordered on Friday night going into labor day weekend.The food was awful.I don't know about the sushi,but I ordered combo fried rice which was so mushy you couldn't even make out it was rice.No seperated pieces of rice did not have any shrimp in it and the meat that was in it I could not tell you what it was. I also ordered general chicken that was very tuff and chewy and weired shapes and sizes short and round to long as my finger.Never had it like that before.The mongolian beef was a poor quality of meat.texture didn't seem like beef.Very poor meal.Very dissatisfied.And it cost me $33.00 for that mess.Never ever again.Decor was not very nice.Not a well kept place lots of clutter.It was close and had good reviews.But apparently you can't trust that either.
