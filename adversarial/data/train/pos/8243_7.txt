The 400th review goes out to this Carousel.\n\nLocated right in the heart of Downtown Markham, the Pride of Canada Carousel ride has been opened since summer - though I'm not sure if it has been extremely popular since then. It's in an indoorish area, with wide open doors which makes it equivalent with the outdoor temperature. It blocks off the rain though, and has glass doors in one of the sections.\n\nI came here during the Winter season, right before the break when they were hosting. It's $2 for a ride in this carousel, even on this cold winter night!! There weren't a lot of people in the line and the staff actually sit outside in the cold weather for this!\n\nThis is one of the most unique carousels I have ever been on, with metal art encompassing the different things Canada has. I mean, the skates, the school bus, the beautiful ships, everything was a work of art, and to be able to ride on it, and not just stare at these objects from afar, it was super worth it! Since there was no one in line, we were able to take a ton of photos of the ride!!\n\nDef recommend coming at least once!
