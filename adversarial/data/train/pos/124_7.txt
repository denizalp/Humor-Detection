Nice friendly staff, the poker machines geared like the rest of the strip and pretty tight.\nTighter than Dolphin sex,, and that's water tight.\n\nThe live casino entertainment is pretty much gone. It gave the place unique character. Now just another strip boiler room. Better when Wynn ran it.\n\nBEWARE!:\nNo comp drinks at the Mirage unless you have a players club card. Strictly enforced! They do screen for bogus info so they have ya by the nut sac.\n\nSome people don't like their casino\/gaming info being mailed home where the spouse checks it all out. It's what happens when ya join up, so we predict this will come back and pee on them. A really bad idea some Mirage management genius put into play.\n\nWe like to be anonymous in casinos and it ain't gonna happen here.\nPlayers club pays about 1 cent in junk\/trinket credit for every $2 you wager.\nNahh, I'd rather be the stealth gambler.\n\nThe most expensive room in Vegas is a free room. Do the math.
