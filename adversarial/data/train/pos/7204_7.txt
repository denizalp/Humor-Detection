OMG OMG OMG...This was some seriously good grub!  We had a party of 30 tonight on the patio and the staff was amazing.  They were helpful setting up the party and sosososo accommodating.  The chef actually called to apologize that they couldn't make something.\n\nWe ordered several kinds of Bruchetta...the Apple and Brie with Fig Jam was KILLER, the traditional tomato and basil one was so tasty it was like it was just out of the garden, there was a steak with horseradish sauce that was out of this world.  We also had calamari fried, wings and hummus which were all top notch.  Where they get their bread...I need to know!\n\nThere were so many excellent wines to choose from, the water was even good as well and was served in a quaint old fashioned milk bottle.\n\nOn the patio there was a musician who played a guitar and sang who is worth going back for alone!\n\nThe place is well appointed has cool art, comfy seating  and nice bathrooms too...\n\nI can not say enough...you must go to 5th and Wine!
