They have JUST officially opened, so staffing is an issue. Tonight, they only have four or five captains\/servers, but about 15 very inexperienced runners\/bus who are also mostly very young. They better pickup their grooves or they won't survive.\nWhile the decor is impressive, not everything make sense. They have four gigantic projectors playing some sort of shows at volume that's kind of annoying...not enough to hear, but enough to be more than white noise.\nThe food comes in impressive modern plates, but the eating plates, bowls, and cups are...flimsy and fragile....two items on our table are seriously chipped, and my aunt's cup is cracked enough to leak. Today is the day after their grand opening....\nFood wise, they are fairly flexible when it comes down to method of cooking from the set menu. After all, not everyone want everything deep fried.\nTheir seafood are fresh, and made as close to perfection as we've paid them to do, so, for Mississauga, they are a head and above, and then some.\nIf they train their team better, get a few more experienced captains, and, very literally, replace their cheap cups, keep things up after 6 months they just may become a permanent hangout in Mississauga.
