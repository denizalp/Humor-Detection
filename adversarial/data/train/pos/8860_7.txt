Decided to check out this show because it's one of Britney's final shows of her contract. While I'm not totally disappointed, I'm certainly not happy with her concert experience. \nBritney's actual performance deserves 4 stars. She performs a lot of her usual hits, has great backup dancers, and utilizes the stage set well. However, she doesn't dance very well (only moves arms and skips around) given that she lip syncs. If you're not going to sing at least put more effort into dancing! I get it though, she's getting older and still at least attempts to dance.\nThe actual atmosphere of the concert, besides Britney's performance, is absolutely 0 stars. In the beginning of the show, an announcer says \"feel free to get out of your chair and dance.\" I had two 7-feet giraffes in front of me and you might think, \"if you just look in between their heads you can definitely see!\". Well, plot twist bitch because right in front of them was another giraffe. Everyone should just be required to sit down and dance in their seats because almost no one could see besides the freakishly tall people.\nThe show is ending in a week, but I needed to vent. No one is really benefitting from this review lol.
