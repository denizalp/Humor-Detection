I love this place and go there frequently.  Mother India is one of the few roti spots in town that will still serve you a roti that will make you sweat.  If you order a roti here that is hot, be prepared for the burn, because Mother India don't play.  Add to that a healthy selection of delicious vegan friendly ingredients and you know why this is one of the best spots in town.
