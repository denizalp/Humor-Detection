Desserts for Dinner is my motto! \nQuote from the hubby:  \"you know what I got full from?  The MENU!\n\nTID BITS: \n1) Sweets Raku is located in Chinatown in the same parking lot as Raku (japanese grill restaurant).  Next to a massage place. The sign is super small. \n2) $19 for a 3 course prie fixe (you get to pick 1 dessert. The other 2 are the amuse and a petit four, which is already set for the day).  $7 for one glass of wine for pairing.  $12 for ala carte desserts.  \n3)  Kid friendly, however it's a small place with a quiet atmosphere.  \n\nWith a cute open kitchen, Mio Ogasawara (2013's Pastry Chef of the Year) and her assistant created our beautiful sweets right in front of our eyes.  A truly talented  team.  \n\nThe experience and surprises that Sweets Raku brings to the table is an adventure in itself.  AND I'm sure every visit is different. I won't reveal too much, so you too can be WOWed like us. \n\nHere are a few SNEAK PEEKS: \n1)  CARIB (coconut panna cotta). This dessert is NEW for the summer. It's SO refreshing, light and filled with tropical ingredients (papaya, kiwi, banana flamb√©).  A show in itself.  MY FAVE.  I'm still drooling over the melon cream. It's DELIGHTFUL. \n\n2) BATON (chocolate & pistachio mousse).  Did you know chocolate could be spread  thinly and baked?  You need to check out the construction of this!  \nBold chocolate flavors with a very mild pistachio mousse. Hidden surprises inside. Hubby enjoyed this dish...for the chocolate lovers!\n\n3)  CREAM PUFFS (our petit four for the day).  Sounded boring at first. But, pretty darn good.  We got to choose our cream and jam.  Puffs were airy and crisp. Creams were light (not sweet); I liked the strawberry.  You can taste the fresh fruit extracted to make the jams.   \n\n-PRESENTATION AND EXPERIENCE: 6 stars!\n-TASTE: 4.5 stars.  Desserts were not  too rich or heavy (which is a good thing).  Was hoping the petit four would be more  unique. \n-SERVICE: Friendly! Make sure you hang onto your dish until you are completely done.  One gal had a tendency to take the dish away too soon.  She actually took away my menu, when I wasn't done yet.  She brought me another one without question  (to eat!!). \n \nYOU GOTTA CHECK OUT THE BATHROOM.  I laughed and stayed giddy the entire time in there.  It's quite the experience.   \n\nHave fun!  This place is a MUST TRY.
