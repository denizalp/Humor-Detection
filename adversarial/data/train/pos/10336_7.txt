Hey, I stopped in the other day and tried their split pea soup. They let ya try stuff...so they can get you hooked on it. My God...\n\nI hate to uproot the memory of my grandmother, but this might be the best split pea soup ever. It was smoky, not thick at all, and had these savory, fat chunks of ham in it. I'm gettin' it next time I go if they have it.\n\nTheir italian wedding soup is great also. So is their pasta salad. \n\nI wish I could eat here everyday.
