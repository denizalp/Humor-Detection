ShakeShack is located on the strip at the New York New York Hotel.\n\nWhen you walk in, seats are first come first serve. They have seating available inside and outside. But trust me those seats fill up fast~! So I suggest you grab your seats then have someone go up and order for everyone.  \n\nThe menu has a nice variety of stuff. They got burgers, hotdogs, fries, shakes and booze.\n\nThe Grub. http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/shake-shack-las-vegas-2?select=-px6rl72eM0-ch_hiPUcIg\n\n[[ SHROOM BURGER $6.99 ]] (Vegetarian) Fried portabella mushroom filled with melted muenster and cheddar cheese, topped with lettuce, tomato and shacksauce. \n\n[[ DOUBLE SHACK BURGER $7.99 ]] 100% angus beef topped with cheese, lettuce, tomato and shacksauce. \n\n[[ CHEESE FRIES $3.95 ]] These fries are covered with a blend of cheddar and American cheese sauce.\n\nOverall: The shroom burger was alright, I definitely liked the double cheeseburger more! And those cheese fries your delish too!
