There's a lot more to Vegas than the mega-casinos, booze, strip clubs and celebrity chef restaurants. The Container Park, located downtown, is a family friendly place that attracts locals andtourists alike. The stores there are more like boutiques. No chain stores owned by a mega corporation here, just independently owned small businesses. \n\nAt the entrance is a giant metal preying mantis. At night it takes on a new life by lighting up and shoots flames out of its antennas. This is something I'd expect to see at the Burning Man. Through the entrance, you'll see a collective of small shops in what lookslike repurposed shipping containers. In the center ofit all is a decent sized play area for kids. The top of a climb & slide structure is about 3 stories tall, but that top level may be subject to closure at times. Towards the back of the park is a stage where bands play. \n\nThe Dome near the entrance is like a small planetarium, where the entire round dome acts as a movie screen. There are shows for kids as well as adults. Showtimes and lineups are on their website. Currently, Groupon has a deal so take a look if you like saving deniro. \n\nShops here vary from hot dogs to truffles, a tatoo parlor, clothing boutiques, kettle popcorn and many more. This is a great place for out-of-towners to visit, and locals to bring the family. \n\nWorth checking out! I plan to go back on my next trip. \n\nNotes: \n* Paid parking along the streets surrounding the park. Mind your time or get a ticket, like the car parked next to me.\n* Security guards are walking arond, especially the play area.\n* Currently, Groupon has a deal for tickets to The Dome, so take a look if you like saving deniro. \n* Check their calendar for list of free events and concerts.
