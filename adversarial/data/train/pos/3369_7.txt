I visited here two times since the summer season and have had two of the worst margaritas I've ever tasted. Two different bartenders both they made consistently bad, like try tasting your drinks.\n\nMargaritas -\nThere's something wrong with their mix they use. The color isn't right. I felt ill from drinking these. I asked if we were getting top shelf tequila both times but I don't believe that's what we were served.\n\nMoscow Muel-\nIt would have been a great drink but there was entirely too much lime juice. I gagged on the lime burn.\n\nCorona- (can)\nYou think this would impossible to screw up. They put a lime on top and it's so dry it's falling apart in chunks while I'm trying to drink my beer.\n\nOverall it seems like a fun atmosphere but they're a Mexican bar and they can't make a signature drink correctly... or any drinks for that matter.
