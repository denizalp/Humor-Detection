How have I not written a review of this place yet?!?!\n\nSo for starters it's a Walmart. They have  cheep cloths, cheep groceries and pretty much anything else you can think of. Just don't forget to put cheep in front of it. Now onto this store. It's always disorganized stuff everywhere it shouldn't be and I always find myself singing the \"Only at Walmart\" song whenever I'm here. There are several cashiers who are incredibly slow. Also as depicted in my pic we came out from a short shopping trip to find a hypodermic needle syringe included, a spoon and a wife beater. It was so gross. I quickly put my son in his car seat while the man put groceries in the back and went to find a manager. Instead I saw a police officer sitting in his car and went to tell him about it. He came over and removed the items. It was right in front of the truck so we couldn't even pull out. I wish I could say that was my last time at any walmart but alas it hadn't been. As much as I hate it I can always think of something I need at walmart and I think a piece of my soul dies every time.
