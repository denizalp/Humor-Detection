I've seen better burgers at McDonald's.  This thing was pathetic.  A bun that makes Wonder bread look healthy.  The meat was greasy, overcooked, tiny, and way too common.  The rest was process cheese, tomatoes, etc.  Completely empty.  \n\nI've heard people compare it to a drive-through in California.  That is completely irrelevant.  If you want quick, the drive-through at McDonald's is just as quick.  Or you can forget eating, as that's even quicker.
