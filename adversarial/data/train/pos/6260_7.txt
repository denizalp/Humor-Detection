This store, by far, employs the most unintelligent, unhelpful, and blatantly rude\/lazy staff I've ever seen in the Kroger family of stores. \n\nI actually had a self-check cashier who was too lazy to push a single button to clear my screen for me, and kept INSISTING that I wait for her to finish her social conversation, while lying to me and claiming she was helping some man that she wasn't talking to... (She was instead gossiping with two other customers\/friends of hers.) \n\nOf course, I get stuck with such incompetence while I've got meat in my car, baking at 110 degrees. Not only did she refuse to do her job, but she refused to page a manager, and then attempted to incite a fight between myself and another customer. After I went and got the manager, I returned to find the woman gossiping about me to another customer who wasn't even involved. \n\nSpoke with the store director the next day. Explained the situation, was informed that it was not the first time this woman had behaved poorly and not followed procedure... yet she's still working there a month or two later. She also seems to have a penchant for sticking her nose in everyone else's business, because every time I see her, she's gossiping with someone about someone else in the store or about other customers. \n\nThanks, but I'll take my business elsewhere. Don't need that shit when I'm trying to buy some groceries.
