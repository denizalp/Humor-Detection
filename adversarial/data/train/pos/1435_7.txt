Do yourself a favor and don't stay here. Will you can stay here if you'd like to experience the following...pushy cleaning staff that do not listen to your request to come back later, shower water that takes at least 15 mins to warm up, sinks that equally as long to drain, food that triggers a bathroom explosion. Lastly, there's zero circulation\/ventilation in the casino area causing population similar to LA traffic. \n\nOverall, a bad experience over Labor Day weekend.
