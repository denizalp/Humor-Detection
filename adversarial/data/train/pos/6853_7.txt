I dare you to punch me, my face is so hard, you'll say \"Ouch, you crunched me!\" -Froggy Fresh\n\nOut of the trio of rolls we ordered, my favorite was the Green Beret Roll, such fresh flavors emanating from the thinly sliced jalape√±os, with the crunch of the cucumbers and pop from the matching green roe (which are wasabi flavored baby flying fish).\n\nThe potstickers were so plump, moist and flavorful, and hot... essentially pillows of porky goodness.  And just like a real fluffy pillow, these big boys can choke you if you try putting the whole thing in your mouth at once, they're that uuuge!\n\nAnd after I posted my sushi photo, the owner, Kelly, came by to chat with us for a bit, and to say Thanks for the pic.  If you enjoy an outgoing personality with a whopping side of friendly and gracious demeanor, then ask for her by name!
