So, you know how it is. You have to travel and you think you've packed everything and then you get to the hotel and realize you forget to pack your pajamas! Well that's what happened to a co-worker of mine, who like me, had traveled into Pittsburgh for a week-long planning session. So she was planning to go here to shop and I decided to tag along as didn't want to go back to the hotel.\n\nWe went and found a good selection of sleep ware - not as many pure cotton options as my co-worker would have liked, but she did finally find a pair that did the job. After that selection, we wandered thru the store a bit, and she picked up some presents for her kids, so that gave me the opportunity to be impressed by the toys selection here. The gentleman working this section was also very helpful.\n\nI thought it was interesting that this store had a MASSIVE selection of Penguins memorabilia and also that its overall selection was fairly different from what I've found in Walmart's located in my home state of Florida. Its nice to know Wal-mart isn't all cookie-cutter in its selection! \n\nOverall a nice store, with great friendly staff - checkout too, the lady was super nice and we had a lovely conversation with her while my co-worker paid her bill! \n\nYelp 65\/2018
