Very nice multi-theater complex on the second floor of the Orleans casino.  Nice because it's up above all the action which kind of sets it out of the way for normal foot traffic and that means it doesn't get super busy. \n\nIt's clean and has decent upkeep.  There was this one time some drunk guy barfed in front of his seat but that's not representative of the theater on a regular basis so strike that from your mind. \n\nThe screens are large making every seat feel like a good selection.  The seats are super soft but man, the seat backs recline way too much.  Looking at the screen from that ultra kicked back position can bring on a case of vertigo until you get used to it. \n\nPark on the backside of the casino or the parking structure back there if you want easier walking access to the theater once you get inside. \n\nHave a popcorn snacking good time!
