I become a completely different person in Vegas. Most of us do. We play, we gamble, we watch the sun rise before hitting the hay, and we literally throw money away better than MC Hammer. And apparently, I enjoying long delays for my flight...? \n\nWell why wouldn't I? The perks to killing a few hours in LAS:\n\n-The people watching. Those getting off the plane are drunk, excited, and still have a little of that innocence behind their eyes. Those boarding their planes are... still drunk,  though from a 48-hour binge involving some form of grain alcohol, they're typically missing at least one crucial item of clothing, and it's obvious they've seen things. Unmentionable things. \n\n-SLOT MACHINES. Scrap together the seventy-five cents you have left in the corner of your purse and hit the penny slots. If you win, hey maybe you can replenish a little of that savings account you somehow depleted miraculously in a blink of an eye. And if you lose, well seventy-five cents isn't gonna buy you much else. \n\n-Drinking. It's just different in Vegas. I'll leave it at that.\n\n-Easy to get around. I can go from security, which was surprisingly bearable, to having my fanny parked at a slot machine in my terminal in under ten minutes. \n\n-Mono-rail. Convenient for so many reasons. \n\n-Free Wi-Fi. How much did I spend at that club at... 5 A.M.?!?\n\nQuite a pleasant experience for an airport, compared to some. (I'm talking to you ORD.)
