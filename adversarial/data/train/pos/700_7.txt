Best. Pizza. In. Charlotte!!! \n\nI love, Love, LOVE Pizza Peel. Luckily, it's just around the corner from our house & even though I try to eat healthy it doesn't take much effort for Joe to twist my arm and \"make\" me eat at \"the Peel.\" In addition to having absolutely phenomenal pizza, Pizza Peel has a very diverse beer selection, is a great place to watch sporting events, has yummy sandwiches and the best house salad in town. \n\nPizza Peel is definitely not a place to go to if you want to have a nice quiet dinner, but it's always a good time and fun for the whole family.. they even have a magician on Friday nights for the kids! \n\nDefinitely ask for the secret menu and don't be afraid to order the mystery beer... we haven't been let down yet by the selection!
