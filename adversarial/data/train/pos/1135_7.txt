After shopping for furniture at the good 'ol blue building (of the Swedish variety) we needed a place to have dinner.  The Deerfoot Meadows area has a good selection of eats, except most close down at 7 or 8pm.  My handy Yelp Mobile app to the rescue...\n\nThis place has some pretty bleak reviews so I was reluctant.  However, the stomach was calling and my wife and I were hangry so we decided to try it regardless.\n\nAs we entered we were immediately taken by the huge screen where they play sports.  At the time the Flames were playing... yey!  But they were losing... boo!  Being a sports bar you find your own table.  We found one just to the right of the bar.  The atmosphere was quite alive for a Tuesday night.  I'm sure they have a few travelers from the Sandman Hotel next door.\n\nThe serving staff was quite friendly and very attentive.  They came by every few minutes it seemed and asked if we needed anything.  Sometimes we'd see a different  server asking if we needed help.  That's tag team service!\n\nBecause of allergies we alerted them before ordering, they were very careful to talk to the kitchen.  The manager came out and even gave us his assurance we were safe with our selections.\n\nWhen the food came out one of the chefs talked to us and let us know the food was safe for us to eat as well.  That was re-assuring for sure.  For appetizers we had the deep friend mac & cheese balls... so good and perfect with the ketchup and saracha dipping sauce.  We both had the shark burgers and the burgers were as good as you'd get a a Moxies or even an Earl's. \n\nThe serving staff... well how do I put this nicely, all were easy on the eyes.  It's great to see a place that can dish up good service, good food at a decent price and not have to rely on the \"atmosphere\" if you know what I mean.\n\nI'd definitely go back.
