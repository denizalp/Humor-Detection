Came in on a whim and we are glad we did. We had the lunch and we tried the #1 steak, shrimp, brisket and the beef bulgogi. We also had the mushrooms and vegtables. Great experience and the severs were on top of things. I couldn't remember all of their names except Seong. We will definitely be going back again.
