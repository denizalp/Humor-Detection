Started out with asking for a wine list which our waiter insisted on us telling him what we liked. He came off as if getting a list for us was a bother. We then ordered appetizers, calamari and chicken caesar salad which were mediocre. The chicken on the caesar tasted like teriyaki which seemed odd and the Calamari was just ok. We then waited a very long time to order dinner and when the waiter did return to take our order I asked for the dressing on my salad to be on the side. He came back with, I toss it in the salad. \"I don't care I prefer it to be on the side\"! I ordered the salmon which was drowning in butter, unpleasant in texture, and served with two small pieces of broccoli and 2 small quarters of potato. My overall experience is that I won't return nor refer Alexi's Grill. They have a long way to go on improving the food as well as the customer service.
