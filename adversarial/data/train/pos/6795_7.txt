Told early on by trusted palates that Cinnamon's was merely average it was some eighteen months after opening that a visit was finally scheduled, the presence of fellow Flapjack lovers in the house an impetus to finally check out the Hawaiian import that some publication apparently decided serves the eight best specialty Pancake in the United States.\n\nLocated at 7591 West Washington Avenue in the space previously occupied by Chef Marc's Parma, the layout similar but more open and less personal in its d√©cor, guests entering Cinnamon's will quickly find themselves face-to-face with a hostess podium, this early Saturday fairly quiet with most guests lined along the north wall.\n\nPlaying light pop music overhead that is neither distracting nor necessary, the deli cases where Sgrizzi used to keep Salami and Salads now containing branded apparel and Lemon Cookies with proceeds benefitting The Animal Society, it was after sitting at a sizable banquet that a pleasant server named Alyssa stopped by to take orders, the $3.25 bottomless Coffee so smooth that no Cream or Sweetener is necessary kept full without a need for reminder throughout the morning.\n\nOffering several island favorites plus items specific to Nevada, Pistachio Pancakes but one example, it was instead from daily specials and Cinnamon's favorites that five items were ordered, the $3 Cookie for a cause big, flexible and warm with plenty of Butter plus a delicate Citrus finish.\n\nAble to order most items in half-portion, the prices adding up to a bit more than full-size plates but allowing greater variety, it was less than ten minutes after requests were made that four large plates arrived along with dishes for sharing, the house-roasted Pig offering a succulent first bite beneath a nicely poached Egg and tangy Hollandaise though the Tots tossed with Onions and Peppers were a little overcooked.\n\nMoving on to sweeter things, Pure Maple Syrup brought from home used to slick Hawaiian Bread French Toast that would have achieved better texture with more time in Custard, it was from here that 2 x 2 short stacks were tasted, the daily special Carrot not really all that special save for rare bites featuring Fruit while the famous Guava Chiffon were medium-fluffy and light in Buttermilk which allowed one to focus more attention on the sweet and sour Sauce that tastes a lot like the liquefied interior of a Guava-Cheese Pastry.\n\nTHREE STARS:  In a city with plenty of great Breakfast and Brunch joints Cinnamon's is yet another face in the crowd save for fame gathered in Hawaii, the Guava Sauce worth a visit but not enough to prompt repeat patronage though the service team is certainly above average when compared to places like Babystacks, Egg & I or The Cracked Egg.
