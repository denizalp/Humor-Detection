Say what you will about this place, but overall, I dig it. I didn't appreciate it when I lived in Scottsdale, but as I have moved farther and farther away, I find myself wanting to go here more and more. There are many good restaurants, nightclubs, bars, hotels, stores, activities, and people watching. I guess it isn't for everyone since a lot of people talk shit and hate this place. I get it rest-of-Phoenix-metro-area, you don't like the people. WHAAAAAH! Shut up.  It's better in Scottsdale than most of the valley. Here are my top choices in Old Town in no particular order:\n\n-Mastro's City Hall\n-The Lodge\n-Daily Dose\n-Civic Center\n-Scottsdale Stadium\n-Joe's NY Pizza\n-The Casablanca Lounge\n-Grimaldi's Pizza\n-Rusty Spur\n-AZ 88\n-W\n-Fashion Square Mall\n-Culinary Dropout\n\nI could list more, but you have Yelp at your disposal.  Use it! :-)
