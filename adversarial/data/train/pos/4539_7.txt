The spaghetti was everything I wanted it to be! I'd been here once before & remembered liking it enough I was happy to go back. We were in a group of four & started off with 3 appetizers: Garlic Bread, Baked Artichoke Crostini & Stuffed Mushrooms. All were surprisingly delicious! You would kind of expect at least one thing to be average, but nope! I would go back just for the crostini & the mushrooms alone!! Now, I know they're a pizzeria but I was really craving just a classic pasta. So I went with the \"Create Your Own\" option & chose spaghetti, with marinara + meatballs. Like I said, it was exactly what I hoped! The sauce is tasty & they didn't skimp! I'm not normally a huge meat eater, but every so often the perfect meatball sounds like life, & these were! They were flavorful, tender, the kind you could eat without any sauce & they would still be great! Oh, & our waitress simply added to the nice experience! She was personable & pleasant! I know there's always a ton of other places to try, but I'm looking forward to coming back here!
