What to say about LifeTime Athletic.. I for one really love this health club for a few reasons:\n\n1. They are located nationwide - if you travel a lot, it's really nice to be able to have consistency for workout routines and expectations. \n\n2. There are enough machines and free weights even during peak hours. \n\n3. Endless amounts of amenities - towers, razors, lotion, deodorant, mouth wash and so on. \n\n4. Life Cafe has deckhouse healthy options for pre and post workout. \n\nIn general my two complaints is that it seems most of \nthe benefits offered by LifeTime are for people with children and it's a little pricey. \n\nThe staff is always friendly and I LOVE the Henderson location!\n\nOverall, I love my routine at LifeTime and will continue to support and use this awesome nationwide health club.
