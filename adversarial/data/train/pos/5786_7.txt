I'm not a fan of you traditional American style pizza but the kids are. That being said, I don't expect much more than a lot of bread, cheese and bland, jarred sauce from most chain pizza joints. Barros delivered on that aspect, bleh. Our last visit however left me nauseous & annoyed. \n\nAs I waited in the car, my husband ran inside to pick up our pizzas to bring home. An employee, still w his dirty apron on walked out of the establishment coughing & gagging. A delivery kid passed him on the sidewalk in fro t of our car. During their quick exchange the gagging employee stated loud enough for me to hear through my closed windows that he \"had just gotten through throwing up 5 times & felt like shit.\" Then he proceeded to cough, gag & spit right in front of my car. \n\nWow. Attempting to understand the facts that a. Everyone gets sick & b. We're talking about minimum wage workers here I went into confront the management and check on the state of the food we were bringing home to our children. The manager acknowledged the sick employee & assured us he had not prepared our pizza. I doubt he had not had any contact w food or food prep items in the closet spaced area. \n\nI will not be ordering from Barros again. Or eating anything at all any time soon.
