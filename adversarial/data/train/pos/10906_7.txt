\"Cleveland Rocks!\"\n\nI couldn't get the Drew Carey song out of my head the entire time I was in town! Not that that's a bad thing, but not that that's a good thing either...\n\nAnd I also had this quote running around in the back of my head - \"To tell the truth, I'm not excited to go to Cleveland, but we have to. If I ever saw myself saying I'm excited going to Cleveland, I'd punch myself in the face, because I'm lying.\" - Ichiro through an interpreter\n\nI always chuckle at that... I know, it's wrong, it's very wrong, but I still chuckle!\n\nOf all the Major League Ballparks I've visited thus far (what was named) Jacob's Field is one of the sweetest places I've gotten to take in a game. I wasn't fortunate enough to go on a \"pleasant day\" - in fact it was downright uglaaaaay... Thunderstorms all day long made for a wet and muggy evening. Thankfully I had to pass by the bar in right field along the way to my seats - not bad and the prices were actually reasonable for alcoholic beverages at a ballpark! The ushers were actually helpful and sincerely nice (What!?!) - they went out of their way to make my experience pleasant (What!?! Are you kidding me?!?).\n\nThe concessions are pretty impressive, at least I was impressed! The hot dogs aren't all that impressive, but the brown mustard is - If there's one thing you do when you visit this ballpark, it had better involve the brown mustard!\n\nThe Indians Fans in my section were hella funny:\n\nFan #1: \"Dude, he looks retarded!\"\nFan #2: \"Come'on, he doesn't look that bad...\"\nFan #1: \"What press photo are you looking at!\"\nMe: Spitting my drink out from laughing\nFan #1: \"Don't you think so man?\"\nMe: Confused look on my face\nFan #1: \"Doesn't Bartolo Colon look like he's got down syndrome?\"\nMe: Slight head tilt of agreement\nFan #2: \"Maybe 5%\"\nFan #1: \"Yaaaaa\"\nMe: Spitting my drink out, again\nFan #1: \"Seriously, doesn't Bartolo Colon look like he's 5% down syndrome?\"\nMe: Totally confused, but still laughing my ass off - \"How is it possible to be only 5%?\"\nFan #2: \"I don't know either, but he sure pulls it off!\"
