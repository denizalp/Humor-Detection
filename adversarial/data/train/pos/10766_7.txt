I have been eating at this joint for the last 4 years. I have probably paid for someones college. The food is always amazing. The staff is always friendly and the garlic dip and hummus is out of sight. (That means \"FANTASTIC\" for those born after 1990) \nI give it a 10 on a scale of 1-Awesome.\nGo. Eat. Now.
