Before Zeus damned Prometheus for giving mankind fire, he revealed another gift; a man that could show the world how to use it. That man is Chef Matt Carter. Part man -part titan, Matt Carter wields his otherworldly craft above all who stand before him, casting a shadow upon the culinary world. It is in the town of Scottsdale where you will find this man; working his magic - constantly revealing new cuisine and enlightening the pallets of those willing to take a pilgrimage. In his sanctuary, Matt Carter brings a taste of Mount Olympus to Prometheus' beloved creation.\n\nBy divine twist of fate I stumbled upon The Mission, Matt Carter's take on Latin cuisine. Having conquered dishes the world over, Carter set out on a quest to create the Latin experience in the Heart of Scottsdale, Arizona with a smashing success. Offering a variety of traditional food including Pozole (Mexico) and Anticuchos (Peru) one can literally travel Latin America in one restaurant. From Swordfish Veracruz to the Grilled Sweet Corn, and Braised Shortrib to the splendid array of tacos; The Mission's menu is one of shear cunning and beauty. Each dish is eloquently decorated to match the rich artistic heritage of our neighbors to the south, and carries with them an exquisite flavor leaving you yearning for more. Complimented with a drink selection that not only arouse the curiosity but accommodates those seeking their exotic escape, The Mission creates an experience all will remember.\n\nTo complete this unique tour of Latin America, The Mission takes you there with its authentic decor. To bask in the atmosphere of romance is what a trip to this restaurant  will provide. Its rustic ambiance whisks you away to a land rich in culture and decadence. It will truly show you the splendor of our American brothers and sisters.\n\nSo come one come all, The Mission promises the experience of a life time!
