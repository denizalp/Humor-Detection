A casual, Mexican eatery that is not really comparable to anything else. A bit more upscale than a taco shop...but not fancy like Lindo. Not Tex-Mex, but more complex than a Chipotle. There is a drive-thru, but it's not your typical fast food joint. \nThe shrimp tacos, tortilla soup, and french fries are delicious! These items are packed with flavor and cooked to perfection.\nThe steak torta (dry\/bland) and Serrano's burrito (I've had better) are less impressive. \nSerrano's has one of the best salsa bars ever. I dare you to try the pickled habaneros. You'll be crying for milk! \nSome annoyances are several items were not available like the Gordo torta and pastor tacos. Also, awkward placement of the horchata dispenser (separate from the soft drink area). To get your horchata, you have to go through the ordering line. Weird.
