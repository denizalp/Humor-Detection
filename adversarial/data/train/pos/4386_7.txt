To all ramen enthusiasts: if you're looking for the real deal, this place doesn't have it. \n\nIf you never had real ramen (like the reviewer below) and are just comparing to store-bought cup noodles, then yes, of course this is better; it is also 20x the cost of your cup noodle!!\n\nI ordered a bowl of miso ramen with roast pork and corn. Although ramen is usually salty, this bowl was overly salty and lacked that richness usually found in the broth. The roast pork was shredded and served ice-cold (literally) on top of the ramen, which made the whole bowl lukewarm; they had to warm up my friend's charshu pork, because it was also cold. Even though it was a hot day, I would have preferred my ramen to be hot like it's supposed to be! The actual noodles were just mediocre.\n\nI see this as more of a fast-food-type place for the local college students.\n\nWill I be back? Likely not.
