I love ice cream. This place is adorable and right next to The Creek Patio. The decor was really nice and the place was clean. Unfortunately, I thought the ice cream fell short. They had a good amount of options, but less than other places so I was hopeful it was because the ice cream was a knockout, but we thought it fell short. \n\nMy hubby and I both got cookies and cream ice cream. He chose to have a cookie bowl under his, and I just got a scoop. He said the cookie bowl was warm and tasted good, but we were disappointed with the ice cream flavor and texture. \n\nWe both agreed the ice cream tasted almost chalky...not as creamy as we had expected. Overall, we appreciated a new neighborhood ice cream shop opening, but will opt for something else next time.
