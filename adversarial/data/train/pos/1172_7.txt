I JUST HAD THE BEST MEAL OF MY LIFE. asdfklj;asdfjklasjdfkl;aksfjkl;asdfkjl;k;j okay my word vomit begins now:\n\nAte here for my 21st bday dinner... I have to admit I'm a HUGE Tom Colicchio fan so that was what brought me here...\nAFTER EATING HERE, I LOVE TOM COLICCHIO THAT MUCH MORE.\n\nFor starters, I had the MOZZARELLA with roma tomatoes and hazelnuts. SO DELICIOUS. My mom got this FRIED GOAT CHEESE WITH BEETS salad and IT WAS SOOOOO NOM. The cheese was just OOZING and complimented the beets perfectly. I'm normally not a beets person but I LOVED THIS!!! \n\nENTREE: My mom and I got the 24-HOUR BRAISED SHORT RIBS. OHHHH MYYYY GODDDD. These babies melted in my mouth. Literally. SOOOOO TENDER. And they give you a HUGE slab. HUGE!!!!! Yes, Craftsteak is pricey, but unlike other \"fine dining\" eateries I've been to, their portions actually made me FULL and this was worth EVERY PENNY. My sister got the kurobota porkchop, which was quite delicious too, but I suggest sticking to their forte- their beef entrees. My dad got the filet mignon which, I quote unquote, was \"the best filet I've ever had.\" Wow and my dad has had a lot of filets in his lifetime. THAT'S SAYING SOMETHING. \n\nSIDES: Yukon Gold Potato Puree with Chives- IDK how much butter they use in this thing, maybe I don't wanna know but it was incredibly NOM. It's puree, so it's not chunky like mashed potatoes. It's smooth and buttery and just compliments the meat!!! \nSpinach- super fresh spinach roasted with olive oil... pretty simple but I love spinach and this was DELICIOUS.\n\nDESSERT: I was wayyyyyy too stuffed to order my own dessert but my sister got a combo of SPICED APPLE CIDER SORBET + CHAI CHOCOLATE CHIP GELATO. Yes, the gelato\/sorbets are $6 for 2 scoops which is pretty good considering most places only give you one scoop for the same price. We were having a hard time deciding which one to get so our waiter said we could have one scoop of each!! how nice. These flavors were unique and quite delicious! The apple cider sorbet was so refreshing and got me feeling quite the holiday spirit. \n\nThe service was fast, our waiter was friendly and our water was always refilled. The next dish always came out at the perfect moment- not too soon after the previous, but not too long where you get angry. \n\nBottom line: I LOVE YOU CRAFTSTEAKHOUSE.
