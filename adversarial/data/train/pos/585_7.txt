Keep in mind that you are not going on vacation to a resort. Every safety measure that is in place is because  of a reason. Use your time here to reflect on your life and the choices you've made that got you to where you are. I found the 7 days I was there very useful to reflect on my life. It was nice to not have all of the outside noise. Sure there are certain freedoms that you lose but again every safety measure is there for a reason. My hat goes off to 3rd north's staff they were all great. Thank you for everything. Dr. Vines & Edina. Techs - Andy, Kenny, Josh, Omar and the other techs I can't remember their names. Thank you to the nurses who were great and very professional; Carol, Jackie, Rosemary, Jennifer and Tess.
