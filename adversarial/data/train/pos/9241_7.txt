I just want to comment that the atmosphere is very romantic and classic. If you need a first date location, pick this place. However, the waiters are very good-looking so your girl (or guy) may be very busy looking at other guys (cough).\n\n[Food]\nAwesome food. I just need to comment that their special ravioli is to die for. First of all, it's super soft and the meat is well seasoned inside. You only get like 5-6 pieces for the $20 that you pay, so DON'T SHARE lols. My friend was very nice and gave me 1 piece, so generous lols. Some restaurants make that ravioli too thick, to the point where you can't taste the content inside. This ravioli combines the right texture, thickness, and temperature so it's a sure win. The funghi pizza that I ordered is very light and it's great for those who love cheese. The mushroom taste is very subtle and I find this to be a good contrast to the normal pizzas that we eat (e.g. Canadian, meat lovers, vegetarian, etc.). The meatball wasn't bad, we really liked the sauce but one can engulf that dish in less than 1 minute.\n\n[Cost]\nI put this section up because this is not a cheap restaurant. Honestly I would come back to try other foods but considering its price I definitely need to save up a bit. I personally don't think the quality REALLY justifies the price they are serving their dishes at, but all in all it's a pretty solid restaurant.
