I've heard of this place and even driven by, but I'd never been in til they had the Waffle Love food truck in their parking lot. I placed my order then went in to browse and was pleasantly surprised!\n\nOther reviews mention antiques and vintage, and I had a totally different impression about this place than the reality: kitchen dishes, decor items, and lots of wall art, reminiscent of Pinterest with a country twist. Think cotton branches, weathered wood, and at least three different versions of \"I love you to the moon and back\" printed on pallets. It's not my personal style, but I did really like the selection.\n\nGrabbed a couple of bath bombs for myself and will probably go back for gift items like decorative salt and pepper shakers and jewelry. Lots of the items are also geared toward moms, so if you're pregnant, don't be surprised if my baby shower gift to you comes in an AU bag!
