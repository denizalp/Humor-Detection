This place is a big generic yawn.\n\nWhat we have here is your basic river town restaurant for business travelers and old people. There's cheesy faux-swank decor, overpriced steaks, and \"sliders\" (god, when is this trend going to blow over here?).\n\nBread service was some undistinguished sourdough with cheap tasting olive oil and balsamic vinegar straight out of Restaurant Depot vats.\n\nHad a gnocchi dish that was overpowered by the flavor of stale garlic and unevenly cooked root vegetables. \n\nThe cioppino featured less-than-fresh seafood and about a quarter cup of sand. Guess the chef hasn't heard of this thing called a fine mesh sieve.\n\nBottom line: this place lacks ambition, creativity and finish.
