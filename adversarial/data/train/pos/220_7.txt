1 star\n\nFor those that don't like long reviews, here's a summary:\nthis hotel, specifically their customer service is S***!!!\n\nGOOD\n- looks really nice; lobby smelled great\n- Room looked pretty nice, tv in bathroom, nice tub, remote for curtains\n- panoramic view\n\nBAD (i hope u'r ready for this)\n- nobody to help w\/ luggage.....grab your bags, drag 'em to the door, open the door, hold it open, get bags in....repeat for second set of doors\n- no organization @ registration\n- had reservation for 2 full sized beds in non smoking area.....got one king sized bed in a smoking optional floor (same thing happened to a few families w\/ kids)\n- $15 a day to use internet\n- $30 to use the gym (either daily or per use)\n- Dummy working the hallway by the elevators greets me with a \"what's up bro?\"......I'm not your bro you jagoff....I'm a hotel guest, now go get that oversized purple sportcoat tailored and learn proper communication w\/ hotel guests\n- towels smelled like they've been sitting in someone's trunk for a few years\n- desk area smelled like a low budget nursing home\n- bathroom walls dirty\n- toilet flush didn't work a few times\n- shower door didn't close all the way\n- Concierge was a worthless POS; did not really provide us w\/ any type of service. Said we were placed on the guestlist for club, but club said there is no guestlist when we got there. If our friend didn't have a table there, we'd be in line for at least an hour\n- asked for shaving cream, they said 15 minutes; 40 minutes and 2 phone calls later, after I start yelling, worst shaving cream in the world is dropped off w\/in 5 min.\n- Jerkoff old man working the craps table made a few racist comments (if there weren't so many cameras, I'm sure someone would've punched his combover off his bald head)\n- Cocktail waitresses old and miserable....hate themselves, their jobs, and the rest of us\n- They don't check ID when someone is charging meals to a room (at the restaurants), so someone ended up charging a meal to our room\n- Express checkout - noticed the charge from restaurant....called to clear it up and were told that we had to go downstairs to check out (will update when the results of their \"investigation\" are in)\n- stood in line for over an hour (there were only 4 people in front of us), idiot working the front didn't know what she was doing. 8 lines, not moving, nothing dividing the lines......whatever issue you have, pick a line and get in\n- noticed a lot of people had been charged for things they didn't order\n- overall customer service is S**T....seriously....!!!! you might as well take a dump on the front counter, give it a name badge, phone, and computer and let people come to it for assistance\n- Of all the hotels, motels, gas stations, and street vendors I've been to.......this place has to have the worst customer service\n\nok, so it kinda ended up like a book.......seriously though, I recommend you sleep in your car before paying to stay here.....
