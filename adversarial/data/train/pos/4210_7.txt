TGIF sucks. So why did we come here? Because they had a really good breakfast deal for $3.99.  We had a group of 10 guys. All worn out from a bachelor party. Five of us got there first. We were quickly seated. The next 5 showed up soon after and sat down. \n\nWe sat there for over 5 minutes and no server. The place was dead and there was hardly any customers. Workers were running about. Not one came to serve us. My bud asked a lady for service. With an attitude, she said she'll send someone. We wait....no one comes. \n\nWe get up and leave. I guess the TGIF in LV is the same in LA. Horrible. Go to Ping Pang Pong instead for some decent Chinese food.
