I've been to this location quite a bit. I absolutely love the chips! They serve them hot with bean dip and a fresh salsa that is to die for.  I'm usually full before I even get my meal...so be careful! Last night I went with a friend and we sat in a booth at the bar.  It was actually very nice. Our waiter was on it! He was so nice and quick witted.  He brought our meal quickly and it was by far the most delicious meal I've had at  Garcia's. Order the El Pollo Fundido! Melts in your mouth!  I've been here before and wasn't as impressed.  I have had a change of heart and was very impressed this time and will be returning soon!
