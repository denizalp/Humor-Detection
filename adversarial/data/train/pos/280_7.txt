We really love AJs, it is so easy to score hard-to-find items, as others have mentioned, it is more of a supplemental, specialty shopping spot than a day-to-day grocery. The store is clean and well organized, and the employees are helpful. \n\nThe bakery has amazing ready made daily display items, and fulfills special orders. I had a delicious King Cake made for my NOLA-born hubby for Fat Tuesday, it was reasonably priced, too. \n\nThe cheese selection is not-too-shabby, either, so pleasing to my inner turophile. The sushi is on my radar. We will continue to shop at AJs, the experience is always enjoyable.
