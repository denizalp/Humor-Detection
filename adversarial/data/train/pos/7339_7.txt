Got our office lunch from Mooyah today and I have to say I'm impressed! All the orders were correct, assembled correctly, in each individual labeled bags. When I arrived to pick up the large order, the manager apologized for a slight delay for the fries because they wanted us to have the freshest, warm, crispiest fries possible! They even offered me a fountain soda to 'compensate' for their good intentions.\n\nThe large windows added welcoming sunlight during this visit. Terrific staff, and lively atmosphere. \n\nWe all got different versions of the burgers with having both white and multi-grain (they also offer lettuce wrapped), loaded with different toppings (additional meat, cheese, bacon and avocados are the only extra $!), and all reported back satisfactory.\n\nI personally liked the white buns better than the multi-grain, the multi-grain had a sweet flavor and distracted from the juicy, lean, savory burger patties.\n\nThe burger patties are what I would describe as a little more thicker than Culver's, but not as wide like Red Robin's. The beef patty are advertised as 100% lean and never frozen, and you can definitely taste it in the uncompromising beef. \n\nI elected to get the sweet potato fries with my order ($0.50 more than regular fries) and it was a good bet, crispy outside and cooked throughout, none of that limp-y nonsense. The small order of fries was plenty for me, served in a small to-go drink cup, I still have some leftover for a snack later. Try dipping them in the Mooyah sauce (a runnier Thousand Island)!\n\nIt is a la cart ordering system, so you are surpassing Culver's in cost, but comparable to Five Guy's.
