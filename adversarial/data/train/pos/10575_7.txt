I pass this store regularly and they always have the quirkiest things on display, like Rice Krispies socks, or a deconstructed Raptors onesie. It's nuts! Others have mentioned the store being here since the 70s and I can totally see that: the mirror, the very worn round velvet sofa etc.. The owner has this slightly over the top vibe and it feels like Sonia Benezra is reviewing clothes with you. \"OH WOW EILLE THIS FITS GREAT!\" It's an experience!\n\nI'm not sold on the quality of the clothes yet, but definitely on the unique styles. I found a couple of mod dresses I'd love to wear, and a lot of plaid (never enough plaid in the world). The prices are steep, and it bugs me since they aren't made in Montreal. Still keeping an eye on things though.
