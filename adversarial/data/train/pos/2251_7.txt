WORST in the industry.  These guys have no idea what the words \"customer service\" mean.  EVERY time you call them its a hassle and you are told it's your fault that your internet don't work.\n\nAlso incredibly frustrating to go through this LONG drawn out auto attendant that is suppose to help you.  WASTE of time !!   I was sent through this entire long process of resetting my modem, resetting my router and answering 175 questions before I FINALLY got to talk to someone with a pulse (who made me wish I was back talking to the computer)\n\nThen the live attendant said their system didn't carry over my data and I had to go through the whole process of proving who I was AGAIN.  After all this I was finally told they had a system outage.  COULDN'T you have told me that 20 minutes ago when I first called in?  RIDICULOUS.\n\nwhen I asked for an ETA of when the outage would be fixed I was told that if I wanted guaranteed internet service I should have bought the Business Account.  WHAT ??  They admit their residential service SUCKS by telling me I should have bought the more expensive Business Service if I wanted decent service.  Give me a break, YOU SUCK Cox Communications !
