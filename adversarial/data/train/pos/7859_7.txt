Was told I needed to replace front and back brakes - cost $800+.  Went to another auto service center, brakes have at least another 4000 miles on them.  Synthetic oil is about $20 more than other service centers.  Will not be returning.\n\nI'm an not Catherine, don't have money problems, am not mentally unstable or a computer troll.
