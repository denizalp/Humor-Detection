We stopped in here for a slice on our way back to our hotel and it was just ok.  I lived in Philly for 6 years and I've had some great pizza, this place was kind of disappointing one this night.  The staff were not very friendly or helpful and acted like you were bothering them.  \n\nI guess being open later then some places you get a lot of people wondering in and since people tend to order something, they don't have to go out of their way to be friendly or helpful.\n\nThe pizza was more dough then pizza, it was almost like eating a pretzel with sauce on it.  I ordered a sausage slice and they were not very generous with the sausage, it was mostly a cheese slice but with the sausage price.\n\nI would not go back to this place when in Philly again, there are way to many pizza places to have to return to this one.  It also could have just been the staff there on this particular night, so its hard to say.  The best suggestion I can give is to stop in, grab a slice and post a review.  Maybe I just hit them on an off night which happens.
