Pros- Great prices, great view, nice room.\n\nCons- \nNO Coffee maker or lobby coffee service.  You can, however, trek to Starbucks in your pjs for overpriced coffee.  Of course that means you have to meander thru the smoke-filled casino to get it.\n\nFront desk is a joke!  Stood in line 45 minutes to check in.  This is after 4.5 hours on an airplane.\n\nThe casino bar is TERRIBLE.  The bartenders were so rude.  You're supposed to get free drinks if you're playing the games at the bar. (They require a $20 minimum and $1  bets).  They still charged us every time.  When we inquired we were told they didn't know we were playing and it was too late to undo the charges.  But worse that this, they were just plain unfriendly.\n\nCab- apparently if you don't tip the doorman he refuses to shut the door of the cab.  We had no idea we were supposed to tip this guy for doing nothing but standing outside blowing a whistle.  He flat-out refused to shut the cab door.  It was ludicrous!!  Our cab driver cursed him all the way to our destination.\n\nOutlets-  You wouldn't believe the gymnastics I had to perform in order to charge my phone.  The only plug I could find was on an overloaded power-strip under the bed.  Every time the power strip moved the lamp came unplugged as well as the phone!!\n\nTV- don't expect to watch television here.  There were maybe 6 channels that actually showed up on the tiny (like 15 inch) televisions and even they jumped around.
