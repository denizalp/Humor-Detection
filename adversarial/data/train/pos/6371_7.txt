I honestly Only go here because it's conveniently by my house. The girls are just kind of rude. They just talk amongst each other in their own language. They don't even say \"hi\" or \"welcome\" or \"thanks\". I tipped the lady and didn't even give me a thank you she just kept talking. When the lady rang me up she just looked at me when she gave my receipt. Oh! Oh! Aaaaaaannnnnnddddd!!!! When the lady was doing my eyebrows she laid her tools on my chest like was some freaking utility table! -_____________- is she crazy! I was about to bust a Kill Bill on her with the pair of scissors she laid on me. And!!! She did my brows too thin. Nice one girls! I'm all about service and they serviced me in every worst way possible.
