-5 Stars DO NOT BUY A CAR FROM USED CARS. They give used car salesman a bad name. \n\nBought 2 cars on 9\/1\/12, one of the vehicles needed to be painted, should be 3 days, I called 4 days later with no return call, on the 9\/7 I went there to find out where my car was salesman told me they had to order paint and it would be ready 9\/13 so I asked if I could drive it until the paint was in he said he would find out and call me right back, I received no call. I went in on 9\/13 and my car still was not done, so I asked for a loaner and they gave me one. I asked the sales manager for a call when the car was ready, no call the next day, I called on 9\/15 and no body returned my call,so that evening I called and told them I wrecked their car. Guess what they called back, my truck was ready. The GM told me to bring the loaner in right away or he would call the police, go ahead I will see you in the AM. No issues when I picked up my car, but after about an hour of driving around I tried to roll up the drivers side window and there was no window, it had been broken. When I went back they said bring it in on Monday for repair, so I asked for it in writing, then thats where it got worse. The GM told me he would not fix it the car was as is, and I had to keep it or leave it. My trade in had already been sold. Then he told me he was calling the police and left. I had to go to the GM of new car sales and he did resolve the problem, but the used car GM was rude and unhelpful.
