Two & a half stars.\n\nI'm still chugging Pepto Bismol to help me get over the greasy stomach overload of Harbord Fish & Chips.  Don't get me wrong, when eating fish & chips I expect a level of greasiness.  About three bites into the fish and I knew I was in trouble.  If this had been Texas I'd have mounted a little oil rig right on top of my basket of food and exclaimed \"we've hit oil!\".  (urp)  Maybe I've just been spoiled by the incredible fish & chips I ate at the Golden Hind in London, England.  \n\nA couple of comments to add;  First off being oily is one thing but when you can taste the oil its definitely time to change the cooking fat.  This was the case last night.  The upside was that it was a lovely evening weather wise so we sat outside with some other Yelpers and enjoyed a few minutes of the last of the seasonal weather.  \n\nI don't think I'd be going back to Harbord F&C's, at least not without a good supply of Tums, Rolaids and Pepto Bismol in hand.
