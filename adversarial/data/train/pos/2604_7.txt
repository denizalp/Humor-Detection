THIS PLACE IS HORRIBLE!  I cant believe people gave it 5 stars.......they must be paid to review by Noodlecat.\nI gave it two stars because the service was fantastic but the food was sorry.  I went there again today just so that I could make sure I didnt have a bad 1st experience.  Guess what.....I had a bad second experience.  Heres the breakdown...\nPRICE: Way overpriced for what you get.  I left hungry both times\nQUANTITY: Looks big but its a large bowl filled halfway\nQAULITY: The noodels are good but the everything else is so bland.  I had chicken in mine today and it was boiled and had '\"O\" flavour and overcooked\n\nADVICE:  Go to the hotdog cart outside of Noodlecat...you will have a better experience.  If people say this place is good I have no idea what they think is bad.
