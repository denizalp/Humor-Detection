Well No Doubt that this place is probably calgary's best fitness facility but I've gone 3 times to sign up for a membership and was told to come back another time...\"we're short staffed\"\n\nThats a piss off cause I'd really like to give you my $60\/ month for a facility that's half shut down due to construction.\n\nUsually gets uncomfortably busy during peak hours but that should be expected I suppose.
