Where to begin...  I went looking for a more reasonable rental because if I had rented from my usual Avis or Hertz or Budget, I would have paid close to $400 for the week because of the PHX \"airport fees and taxes).  I got a intermediate size car (Nissan Sentra) for a little over $200 for the week including the taxes (which were more than the cost of the car rental).\n\nThere were three people in line in front of me.  As I was waiting to get the rental, I listened to what the agent was telling the customer in front of me about the CDW, etc...  I realized then they're going to try and tack on all the extra charges so they can make more money off the \"cheap\" rental.  It was taking so long to get the paperwork done because they're trying to upsell all these extras.\n\nFinally when it came my turn (about 20 minutes or so later), first thing he asked was whether or not I'd like an upgrade as they're running a \"special\" that week.  How much?  Regular $250 extra but the special is $10\/day.  I passed.\n\nNext came the spews about the CDW and how it's important that I get it and yada, yada, yada.  Nope... don't want it.  My CC covers it since I pay a fee to my CC for each rental ($25\/rental) to become the primary insurance carrier.  They tried to downplay that and say some bad things but I wasn't listening and declined the CDW.\n\nNext, the agent said \"you want the liability right?\"  I said \"negative\" to make it clear that I didn't want it.  Of course I'm going to be liable, yada yada, yada...\n\nFuel option?  $3\/gallon.  Nope, I'll fill up the car before I return.  We're going to charge you $7\/gal if we have to fill it.  Fine... I'll fill the tank.\n\nAt this point, I finally got the car and had to initial a whole bunch of stuff that I normally don't sign for when I rent from the other companies.  \n\nAnd.. because I didn't add on anything to the initial contract (& quote), the agent changed from a \"friendly\" guy to someone who I must have pis*ed on.\n\nThe car was clean but I made sure that if there were any dings, it was noted on the inspection form.\n\nWould I rent from them again?  I'm going to have to think long and hard as the experience was not worth it.  I'm giving them two stars only because of the great rate I got and the car was new and clean.
