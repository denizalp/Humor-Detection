Went here for the first time with my husband, just to try something new\/ different. Got there is was like $80 bucks, wouldn't have been bad but shit, you cant even drink in there...at least have a 420section. Whether it be outside or whatever.\nAaanywho , lol\n\nThere's porn playing only at the bar, which is ok. But they have a lot of areas, so only at the bar is nothing. \n\nWe walked around, checked out everything, & eventually got comfortable.\nPut on a show or 3, that was nice. People were flocking to us, in admiration. I LOVED it.\nIt was cool to try, but for that price, and what u get, we probably wont be back.\nNice experience though, checked off our bucket list
