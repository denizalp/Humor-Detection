Tinker town is neglectful and dangerous. My daughter was enrolled there for 1 month and I had many issues and 1 major incident that caused me to remove my child and worry for the health of the rest of the children. \n They gave my 3 month old a different child's prescription steroid respirator treatment. I have never given them any prescription medication to give to my daughter. They also had tried to send me home with the respirator and medication and insisted it was mine. I imediately unenrolled my baby from that facility. They also misspelled her name on everything even after being repeatedly told different. Most of the employees act unprofessional and I've heard them complain of being underpaid. They are a direct representation of the management of the company. Sherry Overby is the owner of the company and gave a false review on google. If you have any problems with this company do the right thing and contact the nevada health and human services child care liscencing department and report them before they hurt someone's child.
