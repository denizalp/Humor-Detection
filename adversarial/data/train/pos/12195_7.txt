Definitely a place sculpted to a specific demographic. If you are a part of this demographic, realize that my two star rating translates to four stars for you and your ilk.\n     To paraphrase H. S Thompson, this place is a fucking reptile zoo -- and someone's giving booze to these fiends. It won't be long before they tear us to shreds.\n     Go here, throw down some cash for booze, and watch the event. Especially on a Friday. Pure primate ethology in terms of what you get to assess 'in the field', for research. Pair bonding. Bio-survival responses. Dominance\/submission dynamic regarding territory. Semantic 'time-binding' complexes as employed in order to gain\/reaffirm the last three mentioned states. Sex\/morality imprints. You name it. This place lets you observe Leary's first four circuits of the VIII circuit model of personality development. That alone is worth two stars! Enjoy, but bring your temper... patience will go a long way at this joint.
