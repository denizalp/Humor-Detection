My daughter went absolutely gaga over this place. So I made a trip.... and it is a pretty nice little shop. I wasn't completely blown away. They sell mostly cupcakes... and they are really good. \n\nMy two favorites are the Creme Brulee.... ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS! And the Raspberry Cheesecake.... which has a real cheesecake base. \n\nI tried one of the chocolate cupcakes, but didn't find it anything special (it was good mind you), just not my fav.\n\nI was surprised to see this is actually a growing \"chain\" of bakeries. \n\nThe other \"clever\" thing here is how this place is nestled directly between Jimmy Johns and Five Guys! Coincidence... I think not!
