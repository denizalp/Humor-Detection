Nice sports bar to hang out at. They have a huge selection of beers, and the food is tasty, with some trendy unconventional options. Some of the booths have personal tvs, so you can switch it to whatever game or fight you're interested in.  They have pool tables,  a little bowling alley,  cornhole, and a giant jenga to play with too.
