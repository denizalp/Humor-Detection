Europe Bound has terrible customer service.  I only subject myself to going here if I am leaving for a trip the next day and the product I need at MEC is sold out.  Sleeping bags are usually better priced here and they do carry more brand names (I purchased my sleeping bag there).\n\nI needed a passport photo and work in the area, so stopped in on my lunch.  The store has a big sign out front claiming \"Passport Photos 7.99\".  I walked in. \nMe: Hi, I'd like to get my passport photo.\nEurope Bound: (barely looking at me) \"Sorry. The photo machine is not on. Why don't you come back tomorrow? We should have it on then.\"\nMe: I really need my passport photo today. Can you turn on the machine? I can wait.\nEurope Bound: Yeahhhno.  It'd be better if you came back tomorrow.\n\nSo I walked out.  Really? Why keep the sign outside promoting that you can do Passport Photos?\n\nBut I must stress that if you need any help or advice you will rarely get it here.  You will feel leaving dissed by the staff.
