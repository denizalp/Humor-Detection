I haven't been to one of these in a looong time...   Took my girl and a buddy of mine out tonight and had some good breakfast...  All 3 of us with tip ran me $37... not shabby.\n\n- Lots of food... I had breakfast \n- GOOOOOOOD maple syrup... damn I could eat those pancakes w\/ that syrup all frickin day\n- still can't get into grits... idk wtf they're so popular for *shrug*\n- eggs... sunny side up... goood\n- hashbrown casserole?  I'd rather have normal hashbrowns but the new twist wasn't too shabby... good\n- coke... (yes it's important) good...  proper amt of fiz\n- biscuits & gravy... superb.\n- Cinnamon Apples... NOM!\n\nAgain Price was good... I expected it to cost more honestly.\n\nService... great!  Guy was really nice and patient with our indecisiveness (mostly my ADD)\n\nI'm not into the shopping area with all the kids toys and antiques... stuff my mom would love... to each his own...\n\nI'll be back
