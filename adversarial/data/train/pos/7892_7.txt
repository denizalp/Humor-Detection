I'm a frequent customer of Kung Fu tea at their Chinatown and Henderson location and was happy to find out they had a store on the strip at the Fashion Show mall. Unfortunately, my experience wasn't all that great. \n\nI ordered the green tea grapefruit with the herbal jelly (they had run out of boba) and the guy literally gave me a drink with a bunch of ice and couldn't even be bothered to at least fill my cup to the top. I took a picture and will upload it along with this email. If I'm paying $5.50 for a drink at least have the decency to give me a good amount especially since the drink is already stacked with ice and the main ingredient of a tea is water lol. The drink itself was okay, but super bitter compared to the same drink I get from the other locations. \n\nThe service was pretty lackluster as well. The cashier didn't really seem enthusiastic or welcoming. She had this look that made it obvious she did not enjoy her work or want to be there. Also, they seemed to be making the drinks at a random ordered because once you place your order they just place the cups in the counter and the workers making the drink just grab whichever cup is closest to them. So you have people who ordered after you getting their drinks sooner. They definitely need to get their work flow process in order. \n\nOverall I don't think I'd recommend going to this location because of the quality of drinks and the lackluster service. I guess I'll stick to Jamba Juice, Starbucks, or try out that Crushed Juice place if I'm on the strip.
