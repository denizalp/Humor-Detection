They were a great help, well organized and loved the sales! Ended up getting a free extra things I didn't plan on. They were very helpful and it was nice that 3 girls were working so even though there were a lot of customers I was still able to walk right up to a register and check out. She informed me of a sale that I had missed. Basically I had a free item due to me. \nIt was clean and organized well. It good experience all around. Got everything I needed and was in and out within a few minutes!
