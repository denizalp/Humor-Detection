Bought 2 desserts:\nTaro crêpe at $8.50 and\nPecan tart at $8.50.\n\nIt was a Sunday afternoon around 2:30 pm.\nCustomer service was friendly; the server I had was new, hence, she was slow in packing my order.\n\nOverall, the taro crêpe was hard, did not taste fresh at $8.50....not worth it all.\nThe pecan tart was good but did not taste its $8.50 price, I could have bought a whole 6 \" tart for $7 at Loblaws for the same taste.\n\nWith the steep prices they sell their goods at, they should practice a better quality assurance for their crêpes\/cake slices.\n\nThe ambiance was alright but with a hard taro crêpe to eat, it did not make me appreciate it.
