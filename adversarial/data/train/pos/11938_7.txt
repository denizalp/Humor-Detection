My friend threw 4 of us a quadruple birthday party here.  It was a lot of fun because all of our friends were there.  The manager had given us one of the reserved rooms, so that was also nice.  I did not order any food but a lot of people did and it looked really good.  My main complaint is how long it took to get our drinks.  It was at least a 30 minute wait after you placed your order.  \n\nOn the plus side, this kept me from getting wasted, and our tab was also surprisingly low at the end of th night.
