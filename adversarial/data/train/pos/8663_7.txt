The order taker did not look me in the eye.  She did not smile. She did not welcome me to Burger King.  She gave me a new name \"order number 121.\"\n\nSome other girl shouts about three times \"Order no 121,\" slams my bag down on the counter.  No thank you or any thing. Calls me \"order number 121.\"\n\nI have a name. My mother and father gave me a nice name and it is not order number 121!
