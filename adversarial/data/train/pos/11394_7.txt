Short Story- Very Rough Gem\n                  - Above average Chinese Food - Americanized \n                  - Specialty might be Cantonese Style Seafood + Live Seafood\n                  - Service is efficient but not warm or friendly\n                  - Appears a little tired or run down but scores \"A\" with Health Inspection\n\nLong Story-\n\nOnce seated I saw the tanks of live seafood and saw a sign for sea bass that I was interested in. The waitress told me that they are all out of sea bass and haven't had it for at least three days....This was not a deal breaker for me but my husband got offended by the way she said it like I should have known they were out of sea bass. She said today they have tilapia. I'm not a big fan of tilapia so I ordered off the menu.\n\nI got the rock cod with vegetables. The Fish was prepared to perfection and was very moist and clean tasting. The sauce was very thin, light and velvety with essence of chicken and was laced with ginger and garlic. This would have been a perfect dish if the bok choy was cleaned properly. I also note the paddle in my rice bowl appeared dirty but when doing a closer inspection I realized the paddle is stained not dirty. This can be easily fixed by using bleach.\n\nMy husband had the Szechwan Pork. He thought it was very above average. The pork was moist. The dish was spicy and wasn't too sweet like the way Americanized Chinese Szechwan is. It wasn't the same as the way The Szechwan Restaurant Mui's used to make it but still this dish was very good.\n\nThe Yelp rating is very accurate here.\n\nI'm also feeling a 3.5 based on service, atmosphere and averaging food in.\n\nI will round up my rating to 4 stars because the food is what this thing is about.
