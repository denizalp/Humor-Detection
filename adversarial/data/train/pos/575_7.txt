I don't know why I am just getting around to reviewing VTR. I guess its partially because I don't want anyone else to know about it. And, really... you wouldn't if you were just driving past. Off the main path in OC, and next to a really run down multi-family home, you'd never expect this place. \n\nWalk in and take a step back in time. Every mixer, every cocktail, made by hand. Behind the bar - artists. They are not bartenders... they aren't \"tending\" anything. They're creating art. \n\nI don't really want to tell you more, because I never want the regular OC crowd to think they can infiltrate the place. But, the truth is that you probably never could. Paulius runs a tight ship. And, you have to know someone, who knows someone, who knows Paulius to really find the secrets about this place. ;)
