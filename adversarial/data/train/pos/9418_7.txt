Whoa, way to treat your customers, Dude.  I complimented your store and commented your gas price was 20 cents higher than what I was paying at ARCO so you direct profanity at me?  I guess I won't be patronizing you after all when I make future trips there.  And will advocate my daughter who lives in Mesa refrain from using your establishment.  You need to take a class in Basic PR 101.\n\nIf you look at my Quick Tips for both stations you will see I paid $2.63 at the ARCO when your price was $2.83.  How is that not 20 cents difference?\n\nAnd as far as being stupid, I'm not the one who gave my own business a one star rating.  Hahahaha!  \n\nI quote your response to my review since I'm sure Yelp will probably be removing it.  Did you read the Yelp TOS before posting it?  Methinks not.\n\nTo summarize. I do not recommend this establishment if they verbally insult their customers, either in person or in writing.\n\n*************\n\n0\n2\ntony r.\nMesa, AZ\n Compliment\n Send Message\n Follow This Reviewer\n\n     3\/27\/2011\nOut prices are not 20 cents higher than ARCO.
