This lovely restaurant is located inside the Galleria mall in downtown Cleveland. This mall was once a beautiful shiny destination downtown.\nBut, like many other things in downtown Cleveland it has faded away. I have to say downtown has a lot to offer. Some really magnificent old buildings that not only have history, but also well designed and well built. It is really a shame ,just like many other once great cities it has been left to die off.\nBut, enough about that back to the restaurant. It is decorated very late 80's ,early 90's. Which in a way is nice, showing days gone by. It is a great location on the 2nd floor with a great view.\n\nWe came in for lunch. We were waited on promptly by the Bartender. Even though we sat at a table. He was pretty good ,he waited on tables and worked the bar. He did a great job at it as well. We did not have to wait long for anything.\nThe food was very good.The soup was nice and hot. My friend got a huge portion of pasta. So much she had to take it with her. Our Drinks were refilled promptly, service was great. \nThe food was decent. I would come back for sure.\nThe place was very relaxing, our booth overlooked the first level. It was nice.
