Great goodlife! Since it's in AJAX.. nobody goes.\nIt's very empty, all the time. Never an issue to find parking in this dead lot. There used to be a ..grocery store next door? But now it's just empty space. \n\nChangerooms - pass.\nVery clean, pretty spacious considering there's never more than 2-3 other people in there. Bathrooms are useable without grossing me out, so that's a pass.\n\nEquipment - pass.\nLots of squat racks!!! YASSS. Very empty too.. I guess nobody squats here, but they have more than any other goodlife. Lots of room to do deadlifts around here too. Other equipment is pretty standard and never seems too crowded. Cardio machines always empty too. Where is everyone?\n\nCrowd - pass.\nNot too many juiceheads, unnecessary weight slamming here. Everybody kind of just does their thing and keeps to themselves. \n\nStaff - pass.\nThey say hi and bye. Just standard.\n\nAll in all, there's nothing that turns me off from this gym. I'd go again, when in ajax.
