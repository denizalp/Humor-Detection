So I finally came and at here over the weekend,. The outside patio is beautiful, thats where you want to sit. The inside dining area reminds me of PF Changs @ McCarren or another Airport bar, the layout is very long and narrow and you will likely bump elbows with your neighboors while eating. Also, its not \"Mexican food\" , it's \"Tapas\". I know trends are trends but Tapas is dying out and since Toro's has moved ( and a good move I may add)  to more traditional mexican I can only surmise its a matter of time before this place does too, or they just replace it with something else. Overall, I will still take my El Burrito and Frank and Fina's. \n\nAlso, no one reached out to me here from Mercadito on my previous review, so I assume they have ZERO social media presence.
