His cheap prices are attractive at first, but it's cheap because corners are cut.  You'll save a few hundred bucks today, but months later you find out Amin's workers striped bolts, let parts dangle from the car from their rubber parts when something else was being worked  on or he just won't put something back on that isn't essential (bolts, trim pieces, clips etc) and it ends up costing you more money and time.\n\nBecause his shop is very busy, they work like robots, only focusing on one area.  If you went in for a catalytic converter, he would only replace the catalytic converter.  If there is a hole in the system somewhere near by, they won't notice or tell you or worse, they'd break something else while in there and you won't find out till you see or hear it later on.\n\nI also dislike how I call in, he says to bring it on and he will look, I end up waiting 2-3 hours before my car is looked at.
