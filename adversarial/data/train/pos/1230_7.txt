Used to like this place. Just went in, no one greeted me, then after 15 minutes of waiting for the whole staff to stop their vaping session in the back of the shop....a lady comes in and asks for the next person. As I stand up to walk back with her, she looks at me and then asks an older lady if it was true that I was there before her.....as if I was lying. She then proceeds to ignore me as she takes the woman's husband who had JUST walked in.....the one barber looks at me and says \"just let him go man\". Like the guy was more important than me. So I left and won't be coming back. Glad to see that sucking that robot dick is more important than taking care of customers.
