So I really enjoy the Oliveo Grill. So when I looked on their website and they weer pushing their new store Oliveo Pizza I decided I should try it out. I used a promotional coupon for 1 14in pizza with 2 toppings, garlic bread sticks and 8 wings for 13.99.\n\nThe guy on the phone was very nice, so I was happy, customer service is not something that a restaurant should ignore. Especially not when they're new. So I'm glad to say that the customer service is great.\n\nSo here is the rundown:\n\nPizza:\n-sauce was marinara (I wanted white but they wouldn't do it for the coupon) and was pretty bland, it's on the sweet side\n-crust is tasteless, not bad and not good, on the soft side\n-the chicken was great and spicy\n-the onion was too thin but not bad at all\n\nGrade: C- , it wasn't bad it just wasn't, you know, good. \n\nWings:\n-crispy, just like I like them! (I requested extra crispy and I got my wish!)\n-there was no extra sauce in the bottom of the container, and I generally want some to roll my wings in before eating\n- the amount of sauce on the wings was fairly thin, which may be because they bake the wings to finish and it probably cooks off\n-I ordered sweet and spicy and the sauce is really just sweet, the spice is super mild\n\nGrade: B-, they have a lot of potential to be great, but they really need more sauce.\n\nBread sticks:\n-flavorless, just a smattering of flavor on the top (they dust them in some kind of Italian spice mix) \n-thick, soft and crispy around the edges, pretty good\n-marinara was barely above lukewarm when it got to my place\n\nGrade: C+, because they are just bread sticks and the only way to make them really great is how much butter\/Italian spice is on them, they were fairly disappointing. However, if they stepped up the spice they would be great because the bread really is cooked perfectly.  \n\nOverall Grade: C+\n\nOverall Thoughts: This place has a serious potential to be good because they already have great customer service and they KNOW how to cook things, it's just the 'finishing' of the food that really drops their grade. I also like that they deliver late.\n\nI'd be willing to try again in a month or two to see if things have changed. :)
