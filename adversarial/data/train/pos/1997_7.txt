In a nutshell: \n5 of us walk in, are given a tour of the indoor fish market by Greek Woody Harrelson who talks us into ordering two separate fish. Sashimi platter is presented by the sushi chef and I eat the best tuna I have ever eaten. 45 minutes and one bottle of wine later, the salt crusted fish is camera worthy and tastes delicious. \n\nI can't tell you what the bill was because I blocked that memory out.
