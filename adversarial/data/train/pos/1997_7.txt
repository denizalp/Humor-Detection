Disclaimed: I have not gone to Santos for any hair services, only waxing services so that is what I am reviewing.\n\nAnd as far as waxing... don't go here. Please, don't go here. For one, it's overpriced. Two - they do a bad job and kind of seem to not know what they are doing. I have bad my bikini area waxed countless times over the past decade. Probably close to 70-80 times by now. I don't have a ton of hair. It should take 30 minutes to do a brazillian, maybe a few minutes more. \n\nHere, it took over an hour. OVER AN HOUR of pain and torture as she waxed the tiniest strips known to man, and still managed to get the wax stuck in my hair and not pull it out fully and... ugh. It was just a painful, waxey, disgusting mess. I don't know what she was doing wrong, but the strips would continuously not come up and it was terribly painful. \n\nAfter this experience, I decided not to go back but somehow ended up going back anyway a few weeks later for a face wax...you're busy, it's close by, you know how it goes.\n\nTo me, a face wax is self-explanatory: wax the parts of my face that have hair. I was sitting in the chair, and (a different woman this time) was doing like, inch-wide squares of my cheek, one by one. I have no hair there so I asked her what she was doing. She said \"well, you said you wanted your face waxed.\" \n\n..........\n\nI explained I only needed the places where there was actual hair waxed.\n\nNot to mention, the wax was REALLY hot. I just dealt with it because I figured I was being sensitive and wanted to leave. She then managed to somehow drip hot wax into my ear. This should have been impossible considering she had kindly wrapped a towel around my head, but she did it! Then she said (unapologetically) \"Sorry, the wax drips when it's too hot.\"\n\n???!?!?!?\n\nIf the wax is TOO HOT, why are you using it on me? And dripping it all over me and burning my ear? Why don't you fix it?!?!?\n\nAnd yeah, my eyebrows were uneven. \n\nI also got a shellac manicure here and it had worn off within a week. At my usual salon it lasts three weeks. \n\nOverall, the women who work here are super nice. The hair services might be awesome. But as far as nails\/waxing, it seems like they do not fully train their staff and I would recommend not going here. Especially because you can get it better and cheaper elsewhere.
