I can't contain myself... this restaurant gets my first official \"Are you f***ing kidding me?\" 1-star rating.  I want to waste my time writing or your time reading this review so I will leave you with three points:\n\n- Double americano and a bowl of the purple gook (muesli) - $9.18.  Including the \"service\" charge - the \"service\" not including carting my full to the brim coffee 3\/4's of the way through the restaurant.\n\n- The only possible reason to go there is to get the coffee and muffin for $1.98 deal, sit at the best seat (whichever that is) for hours on end, drinking the free serve yourself water (with a new cup each time), and choke the free wi-fi torrenting movies... (yet to try all this but its on my list).\n\n- I was here at 7:30 am or so... its empty... looking for a newspaper, guess they don't have any, so I sit down to \"enjoy\" my food.  I noticed a reserved sign on maybe 8 of the tables... AND underneath that sign on a couple of the tables are fresh copies of the newspaper????  So I see an older well dressed woman come in with a coffee, make herself a piece of toast, and go and read the paper at the table.  What is this? Very very very poor man's Rosedale Golf Club???\n\nGAH!!!!
