Pro tip: Hike Camel Back mountain before and work up an appetite if you want to feel all the feels. \n\nStetson chopped is Beethoven's 9th in food form. \nPork Barbacoa tastes like home. And, I'm from Australia, which doesn't even make sense. It's so good you won't remember major facts about your own personality.\n\nCocktails are legitimately incredible, too. Their semi-secret concoction called the 'One (upon a) Time' truly tastes like stuff, although I still cannot figure out what. How the cocktail menu puts it: \"Barely legal pisco\/coca leaf thing\". Whatever it is, it's totally delicious. Moving on, the Duchovny & Punching is a cocktail in a class of its own. It's some sort of confusing clarified buttermilk thing with a bunch of other things in it which ultimately manifests into something so refined and pure it's what I would fill all the water fountains of heaven with if I were god. \n\n+ excellent and friendly service. So yeah, 5 white hot stars.
