I really like the idea of SkinnyFats. It's super cute and original, but I feel like the execution kinda falls flat. Here's the lowdown: \n\nTHE GOOD: \n+ customer service\n+ cute decor\n+ some select items on the Happy side, including the Sweet Cheese Us \n\nTHE MEH:\n~ pricing\n~ food quality\n~ items like Slow Boat to China, Tu-Nuts, Ahi Taco-San, and the chocolate chip cookie are all just okay\n\nTHE BAD:\n- no seating when super busy\n- lots of hit or miss items\n- most of the Healthy side items, including: The Chickhumm: bland\nThe Vegwich: bland and boring\nThe Caulifire: literally just cauliflower tossed in buffalo sauce\nThe Zucc It: tasteless\nAhi Srirachi: the \":\/\" personified\nCauliflower rice: for the love of God, just don't get this. It looks like bread crumbs and tastes like nothing but garlic.\n\nOverall, I don't recommend this place unless you've been here and know what's good (which doesn't include the Healthy side). It's a cute idea to have a healthy and happy side, but their healthy side just makes me sad.
