Damn this place is legit! Cool location right next to the Cobra Arcade bar. Snoh also has it's own SNK arcade machine with 150 games in it. We ordered the thai tea which game in giant jugs! Also ordered the acai berry shaved snoh. It's all made in house and to order. The goodies were delicious and the service was on point. They've also got cool mural art on the outside of the building.\n\nRecommendation: Thai tea and acai berry shaved snow.
