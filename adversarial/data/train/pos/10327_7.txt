The thought of ever sitting in a sticky, stinky, over filled Harkins again makes me want to cry.  iPic has ruined all other theaters for me. \nFirst off, these seats are huge.  Sorry fly boys, that yawn move isn't going to work here. Copping a feel would be serious work.  And to the 10 year old in every R rated movie I go to way past their bed times, your parent's poor decisions wont effect me tonight.  Unless your wearing stilts no way are you kicking the back of my seat.\nOver priced soda.  No thanks, I'll take a glass of wine, or the complimentary sodas they offer.  Stale popcorn, uh none for me thanks, fresh popped and free!  But save room for the extensive menu they offer.  \nWas it pricey? Yes.\nIs it worth it? Absolutely.\n\nOh, and there's a soft fluffly blanket sitting on the seat for each guest.  Nice touch, ipic, very nice touch.
