Wish I can give this place a 0 star.\n\nBought a Groupon and excited to finally get have my car properly cleaned inside and out.  Scheduled an appointment but had to wait 2 weeks; no biggie, my car isn't covered in dung or anything.  Appointment day finally arrive, made plans around it, got to the garage and OMG!  The nightmare begins.  This garage is in an abandoned house sort of place and there was a homeless person inside their front foyer.  I was freaked out.  Called them to confirm address, and apparently I had to go around the corner.  I took my car around and found the place, parked my car only to get scolded at by the owner (I assume).  Re parked my car, owner inspected my car and tells me I have to pay $15 extra because there's salt stain on the carpet LOL Like fo realz?!?  I just paid Groupon $49 and now I am being asked to pay another $15 to actually do the cleaning? Anyways, I asked the owner to just clean the car and ignore the salt stain BUT that is not an option.  Why? Because the salt stain has to go even if it's my car.  That's when I said \"no thanks\" and just left.  \n\nIf you are saying \"U MAD BRO\", well yes I am.  Because a) I had to plan my Saturday around it and b) I had to drive 45 minutes just to find out it's a mickey mouse operation.\n\nSo if you got suckered and bought a groupon for this place, my recommendation is to just save your time and money and ask for a refund.  Or not and come back and write the exact review as mine and Alex K.\n\nSorry Alex K, I shouldn't have doubted your experience.
