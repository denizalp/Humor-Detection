Finally got around to trying out Toast this morning.  It was pretty busy and we had about a 15-20 minute wait for a table.  They have completely re-done the interior decor - enclosing the formerly open kitchen, and repainting the interior to warm and homey colors.  When it was our turn for a table, we had the choice to eat inside our outside. Since the weather is nice, we decided to sit outside.  \n\nUnfortunately, we had a dirty table that was not prepared for us and had no flatware.  Our server came by pretty quickly to take our drink orders and brought a basket of cornbread, but still no flatware.  The cornbread was slightly sweet and tasted ok. But it would have been nice if they brought it out warm with butter in the basket. It would have also been nice to bring small plates for our cornbread. \n\nThe menu had a decent amount of options for omelettes, scrambles, pancakes and etc.  The sides included grits, hashbrowns, or fruit.  They do offer turkey bacon as an option so I was pleased about that. \n\nI decided to try one of  the many specials... so I got the turkey scramble.  It included turkey, spinach, egg whites and gruyere cheese.  I went with the grits as my side along with whole wheat toast. The egg scramble could have easily been a bit bland...but it had nice texture and flavor.  The grits were not the best but were ok.\n\nWhile we were waiting for our food to come out, twice someone from the kitchen tried to serve us someone else's food.  This is not a great sign.   Also, they must have messed up the order of a table close by, because I heard their server tell them that they were taking $16 off their bill. \n\nI might rate the food 4 stars, but service overall was off and I would rate that 3 stars.   But if they correct some of the service issues, I think they can make this place a success.
