I've been wanting to try this place for years!  I've had it bookmarked since the last time I was in Vegas two years ago but we were unable to fit it in our schedule.  I knew I just had to try a Stone Crab claw this time no matter what.  We were so stuffed and we definitely fit it in our schedule and came in JUST to try the claws.  We saw that there was an appetizer version with 2 claws and that was what we ordered... one for each of us. I WISH I had room to fit more because it was so yummy.  The mustard sauce that you dip the crab in is SOOOO delish!  I can slather it on everything and eat it.  You also get an awesome bread basket to start off with and unfortunately we couldn't even eat that!  I had a bite of a pretzel bread and I just couldn't eat anymore.  We also ordered blood orange gin fizzes... which were so refreshing and tasty.  I will definitely come back and have a real meal here and not just a crab claw at the bar.
