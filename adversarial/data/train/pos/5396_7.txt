This has got to be one of the worst experiences I have ever had at an Arizona Hair Company. The girl that cut my hair had a hard time cutting it short. I had to ask her to cut my hair shorter three times and its still not as short as it should be. Then proceeded to sound irritated that I kept making her cut my hair. If she cut it right the first time it wouldn't have taken an hour just to cut my hair. She still did not have it short enough and I am so disappointed because it took me a while to get my nerves up and chop my long hair. In the end she said its the way you style it. Well, I styled it and its still way longer than it should be for the cut and style I wanted.
