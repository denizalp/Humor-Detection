Fuck this place. Staff is rude as fuck, no customer service skills at all. Beware if you order a mixed drink too because they will only put a splash of liquor in it. Ordered a whiskey sour that was just straight sour when I asked bartender if she could fix it she told me there's nothing I can do about it, asked to speak with manger and he took over 30 mins to get to us plus we had to flag him down. He was just as rude said he will have them remake my drink but the same exact way. Bunch of fucking tools if you ask me and the girls there are ghetto and ugly with pepperoni nipples and nubs. I hope this place goes under.
