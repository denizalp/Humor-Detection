Staying within walking distance of this place and seeing all the good reviews on Yelp made me want to give Mikado a try. Realizing this is one of three locations that have lasted 30 years would make a it pretty safe bet for a quality sushi spot. Unfortunately, my experience was quite disappointing.  \n\nThe place has nice style, but it is showing its age a bit. You can see signs of wear and tear throughout the restaurant, but the lights are kept dim so it might not be immediately evident. I liked how the plates were on the table with two rocks sized water glasses in the middle forming a cool geometric pattern. A complementary plate of somewhat mushy edamame were brought out, along with warm washcloths as we looked over the menu. The service was very friendly, professional and polite.\n\nTo order sushi rolls you need to use a check off sheet. Most of the rolls had English translations, except the special rolls which were entirely in French or with ambiguous descriptions.\n\nWe ordered a large variety - for nigiri yellowtail, sockeye & Atlantic salmon, white tuna and Eel. I didn't like that you had to a minimum of 2 piece of nigiri. We also ordered a yellowtail with shallot roll, the mexican roll and the rainbow roll and off the special menu the \"mix and match\" which turned out to be tuna and salmon tataki served on a fried rice cracker. \n\nThe rolls were enormous, but bigger isn't always better. I did not care for the rice quality. The fish was bland and the eel was fatty with a weird flavor. The rainbow rolls were different from most places, larger and it seemed to have canned tuna with mayo inside. The Mexican roll was similar except spicier. I haven't had sushi this poor since I was on an all-inclusive vacation in mexico, but there it was somewhat expected, in Montreal though a complete surprise!
