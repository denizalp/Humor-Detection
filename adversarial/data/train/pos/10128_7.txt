I wanted to like this place after my hubby told me how much he enjoyed a previous dinner. The feeling was not shared. Perhaps, this was a hit or miss night, but my sea bass really tasted like a big glob with a can of tomatoes thrown on it.\nI did enjoy my complimentary wine for checking in on Yelp... There are so many dining choices in Las Vegas, with limited time this wouldn't make my top list. The ambience is old Vegas. It's intimate inside . You can roll the dice on this place and figure out if you like it or not if you want to go off the beaten path -literally and figuratively.
