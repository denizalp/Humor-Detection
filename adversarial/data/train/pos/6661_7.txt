Had very poor service today which was unfortunate because the food was overall really good! We got put in the back room and forgotten about for quite a bit. Things got better but then noticed that the waiter put gratuity for 6 on the bill... there were 4 adults, a 20 month old who didn't even get a drink and an 8 month old who old breastfeeds. Just felt like it was in poor taste! Very unfortunate but we probably won't be back
