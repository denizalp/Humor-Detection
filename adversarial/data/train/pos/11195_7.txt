Elmer, our server was beyond friendly & showed up at the right time, every time.  Food, absolutely delicious & so flavorful.  My new favorite drink is called Sharabbi Lassi, a mango lassi, fresh ginger & spiked w\/ coconut vodka!  I had two!  I also tried the Curry Leaf Mojito that was refreshing w\/ a hint of curry.  Love the twist on drinks which is unlike any other I have had before.  \n\nIf it's your first time, I recommend the Chicken Tikka Masala, Lamb Vindaloo & Chicken Paneer w\/ Garlic Nann & you get a side of rice.  All three dishes are different, delish & not one drop was left behind.  \n\nI also love the ambiance which is unlike so many Indian restaurants.  Colorful sari's hang from each window as drapes, large murals of Indian Gods & pictures welcome you along w\/ the people.  The outdoor patio is also beautiful.  A true Indian gem in our beautiful city.
