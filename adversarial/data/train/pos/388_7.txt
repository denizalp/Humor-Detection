Extremely bad customer service, employees are idiots... The food is trash, Michelle the so called supervisor is horrible, she has no common sense and should go back to some basic customer service, people training.  This place makes Panera look bad. If you are here, go to Popeyes or Burger King.  The food is trash, not like other Panera's.
