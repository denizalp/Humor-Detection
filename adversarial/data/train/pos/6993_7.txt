I was in AZ visiting a friend and she was showing me around a cool area called The Mill. It was such a great area with cool shops, restaurants, quaint area.. I loved it! I unfortunately walked into this store. \n\nThis little boutique looked cute from the outside but once you were inside it was pretty commercial and didn't have any charm. Selection was average to sub- par, as we're the sales associates. They were the worst. I was not welcome at all, I felt like I was being asked to leave without them even saying anything. My friend and I were the only ones in the store and still when I asked to try one thing on she told me I needed to leave my small purse with my friend. I am an upstanding citizen and I DO NOT expect to be treated like a thief. \n\nIf you cannot handle one customer, with one item in the fitting room than you are not fit to work in retail. I am never going back to be treated like dirt in a mediocre boutique. \n\nSigned, \nA Ralph Lauren Women's Department Manager
