My three star rating coincides with the overall three star rating that Monte Carlo has, A-OK.  This was my second time staying at here, the first time was back in 2006.  It's not a new or desired hotel in comparison to some of the newer ones nearby, but it does the job for a few days in Sin City.  Location is decent and the free tram which takes you up to the Bellagio was a bonus in getting to the middle of the strip quickly and cheaply.\n\nRooms were average, our room was a bit more dated than the others in our party who were on a higher floor.  I also wish the bathrooms had double sinks and ceiling exhaust fans.  A few in our group were VIPs (hence the reason we stayed here), so I did see one of the one bedroom suites with a living room, wet bar, and jacuzzi tub, which was really nice.  Staff were pleasant enough during the few interactions I had with them.\n\nThe wifi is really spotty, I gave up after a day or two of trying to use it, but luckily I have an unlimited data plan on my phone so it didn't matter too much.  \n\nThe pool was fun and consists of a wave pool, regular pool, hot tub and lazy river.  The food and drinks are completely overpriced, but, welcome to Vegas.  On weekends there is a DJ and some poolside entertainment and its a bit rowdy, however there are some quiet areas to lounge if that's not your thing.  Sundays and weekdays are very quiet and there is music playing but no DJ.  \n\nThere are many restaurants in the hotel, from an upscale sit down steakhouse, to a buffet and food court, as well as some take out type places--pretty much something for everyone.
