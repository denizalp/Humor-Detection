La Distributrice was one of the first welcoming sights on our first apartment-hunting trips to the Plateau, seeing the lovely sign, \"Cafés Glacés à Emporter.\" Yessssss. You're speaking my language - the language of iced coffee. To go!\n\nDespite its proximity and convenience, it took me almost a year to go check out their fare. I think that being just west of the Metro did it...I'm always coming from the east, and there's Flocon just there...and what would the coffee from a literal hole in the wall be like?\n\nBut one day, I was in dire need of caffeine, and was headed westbound, so I swung over to La Distributrice and ordered an iced latte. $4 later, I had a cup of sweet, rich coffee and milk that did not disappoint. In fact, the quality of the drink far surpassed my expectations, ranking among the best iced lattes I've had in the city. \n\nThis is, de facto, a no-frills experience, as you're literally exchanging $$ for a plastic cup full of coffee through a window on the sidewalk, but there's something delightfully honest about the process. No pretense, no hipsters angling for table space, no ironic music playing over the speakers, just coffee.
