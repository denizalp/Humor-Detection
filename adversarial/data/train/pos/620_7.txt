NO TANK TOPS (for guys)?! How lame. My friend had to go to the gift shop and buy a $25 non-refundable tshirt just to eat here for $25 during lunch on a Friday. \n\nNot only that, but they make you wait until your whole party is there before they seat you. The ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting, but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits. The selection of food was not the best. There definitely was NOT any crab legs, and in fact, the seafood section only consisted of basic maki rolls that were rolled poorly and certainly NO shrimp, crab, or any other related \"seafood.\" So disappointing. The only good thing that was offered was the skirt steak at the carving section. The Chinese section was just sad, I didn't even bother to try any of the food from that section just by looking at the food offered, it did not look appealing at all. \n\n+1 star for the skirt steak\n+1 star for having sorbet\n\nI wouldn't recommend this buffet, nor would I come back.
