Horrible employees. They do not close until 9pm on Sunday's and there was a sign that said they closed today at 6pm(Ok thats fine)I was in line by 5:50 and they kept complaining to the other employees saying \"omg we close in 10 min\" or \"I want to go home.\" As I'm waiting patiently they close the gates and tell me to leave?? Very unprofessional if you ask me. They continued to laugh about the people they ran off.. And they weren't even polite about it. I will not be back because of this. I called Cc mills location right after that to speak with a manager and I was told the manager wasn't there...it all makes sense now. Find different employees or you will definitely lose business.
