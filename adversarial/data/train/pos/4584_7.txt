Saw the sign for this place for weeks on end. Finally got a chance to go there on my lunch break. I Tried the pull pork sandwich when I checked this place out. The pork was good and they give you a good amount. I really like the bread that the sandwich was served on. Very light and fluffy. They were pretty stingy with the sides as I got the potato salad. It was good but so far I prefer Shane's BBQ over this place which is right down the street from here. Ill give the place another try cause the burger looked really good. And the bbq sauces also were very good. They need to give you more sides though. The prices are a bit steep. For $10.68 I don't think I got my moneys worth. But for a place that just opened, its not bad to check out. Just don't expect to find any kind of $1 value menu in the place.
