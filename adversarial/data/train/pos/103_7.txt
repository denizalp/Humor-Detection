After great anticipation of the opening of Pastabilities, I was quite pleased with the experience I've had there. \n\nThe first time I went, I was welcomed by the hostess, who explained the layout to my group. There are sauce options and pasta-shape options (including slightly more expensive agnolotti). There are also a selection of desserts (the brownies are great!), salads, and garlic bread. \n\nI've had the vodka smoked salmon with rose, and the spicy italian sausage  - I've also tried the spicy arrabiata, and the cold pasta salad. \n\nOf these options, my favorite was by far the salmon rose, and second favorite the arrabiata. The sausage option was just okay, as the sauce was almost watery (kind of disappointing after the great first experience with the salmon). Also, the cheese garlic bread is greasy and heavenly (not for those on a diet...). \n\nAnother thing I would have LOVED to know going in, is that I CANNOT EAT A LARGE. I ate it for lunch and dinner that day. The next time I went I opted for a small, but was still stuffed after finishing it - and my friends with less voracious appetites can only get about half-way through a small. Be prepared to take home left-overs!  \n\nWhat is really great about this place is its charm. I love the decor, and the bench seating. Also, the cooks are fantastic! They make great suggestions and all seem to really enjoy working there. \n\nThis is certainly on my list of lunch places for the school year!
