Jollibee, why'd you have to go and break my heart like that?\n\nI've always had a special place in my belly for this one of a kind Filipino fried chicken and fast food establishment, until yesterday. I haven't been here for a good 5 years...oh how much things have changed. \n\nFirst offense: an army of chicken fried in advance and sitting on heat racks. The chicken was soggy, slimy, very fatty and the crisp factor was out of the door. That's a fried chicken no no! Ugh\n\nSecond offense: 2 sausages in my sweet spaghetti. What happened to the promised \"meatiest, cheesiest, spaghettiest?\" This used to be my favorite item on the menu too! Double ugh \n\nThird offense: that burger steak combo meal was so bad, I really couldn't figure out if they wanted it to taste like a boot or what! Triple ugh\n\nMy beloved quirky Filipino fried chicken chain went down the drain. Cutting corners is what looses customers! Ugh to the ugh!
