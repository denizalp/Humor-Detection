I had probably the most SWEETEST lunch ever at Max Brenner, LITERALLY!  Pizza and a Shake.  Or rather, to be specific, a Chocolate Pizza with Crushed Hazelnuts, Roasted Marshmallows, Peanut Butter, and Bananas along with a Hazelnut Milkshake.  Did that get your attention??\n\nI first caught note of Max Brenner's Chocolate Pizza on yelp when I saw some really delicious, though crazy looking pics.  Then I saw it on Food Network when Aaron Sanchez introduced it as the \"Best Pizza He Ever Ate.\"  After watching that episode, I knew I had to give it a try.\n\nTake a look at this nice sugary masterpiece (http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/user_local_photos?userid=F_5_UNX-wrAFCXuAkBZRDw&select=p4-bezAdD6Ch_AIyAmMpww).  At first I didn't know how to attack it whether to eat it like a regular pizza or just knife and fork it.  I ended up eating it with my hands because it was more fun that eating that way.  First bite was OMGYUM!!!   Chocolate bliss with all those sweet toppings!  What amazed me was how it almost that that same texture as eating a regular pizza.  The Roasted Marshmallows were like melted cheese and the Bananas had that mushroomy texture.   I thought it was ingeniously creative in a crazy way.\n\nBy recommendation of my waitress, I paired it with a Hazelnut Milkshake.  I like how it came in a nice retro looking porcelain container along with a metal straw to drink it with (http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/user_local_photos?userid=F_5_UNX-wrAFCXuAkBZRDw&select=qBL58hANAreklvSNu-vmEw).  It definitely went well with the Pizza since the Hazelnut flavor carried over from the Pizza to the Shake.\n\nMax Brenner was definitely one of the more interesting dining experiences that I had during my last trip on the Strip in that I only came in to try their unusual dessert.  Though in some ways, the Chocolate Pizza can actually be considered a hefty lunch.  It definitely had the substance.  If you have to satisfy that sweet tooth on the Strip  and you're around the Caesars Palace area, I really recommend skipping over Serendipity 3 and scoot on over to Max Brenner for their Chocolate Pizza or their other crazy confections.  You won't be sorry!
