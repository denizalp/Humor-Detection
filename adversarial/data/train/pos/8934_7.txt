Went here on a Thursday night with a large group of out-of-town guests after having dinner at Spice Route.  Got there relatively early (10 pm) and was surprised at having to pay cover when people were still having dinner.  Three of my friends got in and joined me at the bar, when my fourth friend got in and said that the others were having trouble at the door.\n\nWe went back outside to be told by management that there was a special \"Family and Friends\" dinner taking place, and that they couldn't allow us in at this point.  Having been inside, it certainly didn't LOOK like a family and friends event, but a convenient lie to keep a group of guys out of the establishment.  Moreover, we were told, a couple of the guys were dressed inappropriately (however, they were NOT given the option of going home to change, which we would've easily taken). \n\nIn any case, after making me wait while he chatted about a fight that took place last weekend and subsequent unfavorable review online (which he actually took as a good thing), the manager did reimburse us for the $30 cover we had just paid and we were off.  At the time, we were quite disappointed, but if it were not for that rejection we wouldn't have ended up at Pravda where I ran into an old friend of mine DJ'ing and had an incredible time.  Oh, we also dropped $600 on bottle service which Brant House missed out on.
