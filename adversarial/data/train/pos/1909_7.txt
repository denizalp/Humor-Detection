Popped into this place to grab a quick lunch between errands.\n\nLocated at the top of Litchfield Road after Walmart, at the 4-way stop, and cannot be missed.  Lots of available parking space.\n\nStaff were friendly and welcoming as we entered.  Restaurant was very clean, little to no noise, and very spacious!  Lot of different areas\/sections to eat.\n\nTables are cleared away promptly and staff did check on us from time to time.  As I mentioned the restaurant was very clean as I noticed spillages from the food stations were addressed immediately.\n\nLunch buffet price - $9.79 + soda ($2.50).\n\nOnly areas they lose -- limited variety in food (-1) - didn't notice seafood options or maybe I came on the wrong day; and food was very tasteless (-1).\n\nI probably will not return!
