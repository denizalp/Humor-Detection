As a gentlemen's club, this is probably the best that Vegas has to offer now.  The girls are hot, the club is huge, and the music is awesome.  Overall service at this club is incredible\n\nHowever, I'm giving this 1-star to make sure you all know what to expect.  There are no \"nice\" girls here.  DO NOT go into the VIP room.  DO NOT go into the champagne booth.  These girls are pros.  They will make sure you get drunk, you have fun, and they will find a way to get paid!\n\nThe biggest scam you should watch for is double-billing.  These girls are pros at doing this.  They will charge you and then turn around and take money from your friend (who thought they paid for you).\n\nIf you're drunk as hell, read this message, and still have it happen to you...you deserve it.\n\nHaving said that...this club is awesome.  Just be aware that all of them are money-grubbing hos. In the end, they are just putting up an act to get as much out of you as possible.  Have fun, but don't be a dumb ass!
