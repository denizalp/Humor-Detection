Ate a quick lunch here the other day and basically breezed in and out of the place in less than 40 minutes as hubby and I were in \"errand mode.\" \n\nWhen we first walked in I immediately wanted to leave because it was dark, not inviting looking and only two diners were in there eating what looked like very small lunch portions. My hubby insisted we were committed so there was no turning back.\n\nIf you're looking for a fancy sit down place where you spend a lot of time perusing a menu or trying to decide what to eat, know that this is not the place. The cashier was also our hostess and waitress and when I asked what was included in the lunch special I could barely understand what she was saying. Thank goodness there were a whole stack of menus at the counter so I could figure out what the lunch special was all about.\n\nWe both ordered the Kung Pao special as it's our go to first order in any Chinese place as we know that if they can't make that correctly, it would be downhill from there. Within 10 minutes of sitting down our lunch arrived and it was nice and hot. Our lunch special came with either soup and eggroll and the main event of rice and kung pao chicken.\n\nThe only thing strange was how the portions were doled out.\n\nMy hubby had a generous amount of chicken and peanuts and my order did not. In fact, my lunch special was unfortunately mostly water chestnuts with baby corn and other veggies sprinkled around. The kung pao sauce was decent but I barely had three spoonfuls of chicken. Rather then complain as we were short on time, I ate half the order of fried rice and then took the rest of the rice to go.\n\nMy hubby said his order was decent but as for me, I left hungry and grumpy. Still searching for our to go Chinese and really wish there would of been consistency in the portions.
