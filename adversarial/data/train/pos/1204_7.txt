UPDATE:  4\/11\/2010\n\nPut a stop payment on my electronic check to the dump because, as expected, my refund check never arrived.  Thanks to the bank, I got all of my money back (with the exception of the $30 stop payment fee).  \n\nI am so grateful for stop payments...otherwise, I would probably still be stressed about getting my $1,500 back from The Dump.  \n\nTake my warning...and stay clear.\n\nUPDATE:  2\/19\/2010\nYesterday we went into the store to speak with George the GM.  After waiting nearly 15 mins, George & his store manager (Kim Anderson) provided me with a FULL refund.  George was VERY apologetic and appeared sincere.  \n\nSince I paid by check, my refund will be issued via check from their corporate location in Virgina.  I was told the check would be cut on Monday and be delivered within 7 to 10 business days.   We'll see if the check makes it.  \n\nLesson learned, never make big purchases with a check or debit card.  Instead, use Credit.  That way if you have an issue you can dispute it & the funds are usually returned much faster & more secure. \n\nI am going to be extremely upset if I hear one excuse as to why my check does not make it to my mailbox by the 10th business day.  I pray the dump does not disappoint me, again.  I'll post an update within the next few weeks.\n\nFor anyone else having issues, I would recommend going directly to George.  He has been very helpful. \n\nUPDATE:  2\/18.2010\nAfter many attempts we finally received a call from the receiving department to schedule delivery for today.  However, when the furniture arrived the sofa and chair were both stained and the couch had a large tear in the back of it.\n\nWhat a nightmare!  We immediately refused the products & sent them back with the delivery team (who had 8 or 9 other pieces in the truck that had been refused).  \n\nI spoke with George the store manager & told him I wanted a FULL refund.  He agreed, but told me it would take 7 to 10 days for them to process a check at their Virgina location.  Given the difficulty I have had getting a hold of someone at Customer Services (website does not work & no one answers phone calls).  I am very concerned that I may not get my money back. \n\nA great experience of finding furniture has become a nightmare.  The fact that the furniture I purchased in the store was completely different, makes me wonder whether the company is performing bait & switches or if they are just that terrible.  \n\nPlease use caution when purchasing from The Dump.  The low prices are not worth the hassle or frustration of not getting what you paid for.  \n\nUPDATE:  2\/16\/2007\nAvoid the Dump!  On Sunday 2\/14 my boyfriend and I purchased a sofa & chair from The Dump in Tempe.  After browsing for an hour we narrowed down our search and selected two creme pieces, a sofa and a chair.  After waiting  over 1 1\/2 hours for the computers to come back up, we wrote a check for $1,600 and were told that we would receive a call from the delivery company on Monday, 2\/15 to set up the delivery time for Tuesday 2\/16.  On Monday, I called customer service at 5pm to let them know that I had not heard from the delivery department.  The customer rep then told me my furniture was never scheduled for delivery.  We then went into the store to confirm the delivery with the manager & sales rep.  in which, they assured us that the furniture would be delivered on Tuesday 2\/16.  \n\nToday is Wednesday, 2\/17 and we have not heard anything.  I have called customer service 3 times without any assistance and, at this point, I am starting to get worried.  The return policy is very shaded.... since I purchased my furniture with a check, it will take me nearly 30 days to get a refund.  And, in addition, the company will be charging me a $100 restocking fee since it was a purchase over 1,000.  I searched for couches for over 2 months when i made my purchase at The Dump and even though I found the pieces that I wanted, I strongly regret my decision.  \n\nFor those of you who have been able to get a hold of a manager, please post their contact information as I have tried multiple times to get assistance with no success.  \n\nSince the store is closed Monday thru Thursday, I now have to wait until Friday for assistance....we plan on going into the store as soon as they open to cancel the delivery and pick up our furniture ourselves.  I just pray that everything is there and not damaged.
