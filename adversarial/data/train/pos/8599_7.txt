I've been in here a handful of times, but today I finally tried the food. Usually I just have liquid dinner to build up my liquid courage. ;-)\n\nService is always great in here. The cocktail waitresses and bartenders are on top of their game. After all, they're there to make money and want to make you drunk and happy.\n\nI'm a little disappointed with the food though. Yeah it's a sports bar and I shouldn't have expected much. But sports bars all over the valley are upping their game! Zipps really needs to keep up. Everything is served in baskets. Are we still in the 80s? I never understood why that was a trend. I get it if you're ordering discounted happy hour food. For a regular $10 to $12 sandwich though, give me a plate please! I had the chicken burrito which was very tasty, although it was stuck under a heat lamp for a while because the tortilla was a bit crunchy. I was uber disappointed with the chocolate brownie sundae. Super bland and drizzled with caramel sauce, not chocolate sauce. Bad flavor combo!\n\nScore is a 3.5ish out of 5, although I rounded up because service is never an issue.
