The Trader Joes are generally the same across the board, in a good way. I know what to expect and think customer service generally is good at all of them. One thing I did like is this one is a bit more spacious than my usual store. When that one is busy its narrow aisles becomes its shortcoming. \n\nI came in with friend dinner in mind. Favorite place to get cheeses, snack type items and recipe \"bases\" (ie stock, condiments, etc). and we were able to grab up some of the things we needed. \n\nWatch out for careless housewives though and their terrible cart driving and aisle blocking, but still worth going in.
