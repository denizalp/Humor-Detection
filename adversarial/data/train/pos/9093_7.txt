My contractor sent me to pick cabinet and granite from them. The front desk girl speaks zero English and dresses\/walks like she's working in a night club. Full of Made in China craps. Went straight to National stone next door cause I can't stand Chinese craps!\n\n PS: It made me laugh just reading Nina's response....I think your company needs a better PR. You're way too emotional and unprofessional.
