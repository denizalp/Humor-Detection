This place really hits the spot for me. All the basics that I need are here. They even have the Goma dressing that I love so much! They also freshly prepare bentos for you daily. Just get those earlier in the day. You don't want leftover stuff that's been lying around all day. Also make sure you get their frequent buyer card.
