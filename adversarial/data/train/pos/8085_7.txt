Today  (9\/24\/2016) we went to Jimmy Hulas based on all the great reviews. This was one of the worst experiences at an establishment I have ever encountered. We were a party of six, and we seated ourselves, as instructed, outside in the patio area. We did not get any service for about 20 mins. There was one waitress working the whole restaurant, and the Manager brought us our drinks. He then informed us that he had been hired \"four hours ago\" and was unable to answer any questions we had with the menu. Later, the waitress informed us that the entire staff was let go the day prior, and they had new cooks in the kitchen, ect. \n\nWe arrived at 7:45pm, and our food came out at 9pm. Our food was cold, the tortillas were cold, the fries were burnt and soggy. And, to top it all off, the food arrived in to go boxes. We did not make a fuss, we calmly waited for our food thinking at least the food will make up for the abhorrent service and wait.  They also did not bring out correct orders, and a few members of our party did not eat, and that was extremely disappointing. \n\nThe food was mediocre, not much to judge when it was cold, burnt and arrived an hour later. We were really overlooking the lack of service and awful wait, but this was a terrible terrible experience. \n\nI had high hopes, and today was a disaster of epic proportions.
