I went there for the first time on Tuesday.  I have been there twice more in the past 3 days.  I love this place.  But after eating there 3 times now I think I love the bar more than the food.  I think it's awesome that this killer rock bar serves Chinese food until 2am seven nights a week. Also the people that work there are \"OUT OF THEIR WAY FRIENDLY\".  But the food itself is about average.  I have only had 3 things on the menu so far so I will continue to plow through until I find the one dish I really love.  I will be going back because the place is so freakin cool.
