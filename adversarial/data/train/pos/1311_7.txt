#131 An extension of Analog Coffee on 17th Avenue SW, I happened by here on the day of their Grand Opening. To be fair, I was on the way to Analog Coffee.\n\nThis is the location of the old Melrose Cafe which I always felt was a waste of space. \n\nThis is the supplier of the baked goods to Analog and owned by Analog.\n\nFirst time here did not disappoint. Cookies, danish, and sandwich galore with the traditional Analog Coffee beverage menu. This is more a bakery \/ restaurant than coffee house though I am sitting in the window as if I was at Analog.\n\nThis has a bake shop, butcher shop, cheese shop, pastry shop, and a kitchen. Additonally, there is the bakery counter and restaurant as well as a patio, weather permitting (despite being warm, weather was not permitting today).\n\nMenu prices range from $2.50 (fettunta (garlic toast drizzled with olive oil)) to $27 (beef wellington).\n\nI had my usual mocha in the 16oz variety and one of the peanut butter cookies. DÃ©licieux!!!!!\n\nFull table service and longer hours will set this apart from its sister business, Analog Coffee.\n\nBased on the number of people in here, Corbeaux will have no problems satisfying the masses with in house breads, desserts, and sandwiches. There are different specials for each day of the week.\n\nWhile I have to run now, no worries, I live in the neighbourhood. Until tomorrow... foodies unite and celebrate!\n\nBakery open late!!
