Mandarin Oriental was voted #1 hotel in Vegas by Tripadvisor and I will admit, it had a lot to do with me wanting to stay at this place. Then out of the top 10 luxury hotels in US, this place was voted #6. Not bad, if you ask me! Also, I don't gamble so no casino in the lobby = no second hand smoking issues = happy Cindy. \n\nIt was high season but my mother-in-law wanted to come out here in May so rooms are a little steep this time of year in Vegas. I think it was worth it though because I had an excellent stay here. \n\nI brought my kids since my parents-in-law haven't met my youngest baby yet. And since Vegas has gotten very kid friendly in the last few years, we didn't see it as an issue. \n\nI got here and was greeted with a beautiful smile from Holly (I think that's her name). They had a plate with a warm towel, tea and an orchid for me. It was beautiful! Then they escorted me to my hotel room, got my bags and valeted my car. I thought I died and went to heaven when I walked through the lobby. \n\nWe came into our room and saw that it was a great view of the strip. The thing I noticed about staying in nice hotels in Vegas is that, you always get views of the old, ugly hotels. When you stay in the ugly hotels, you get views of the nice hotels. Oy. So I got to see the travel lodge down there, but also got to see Aria, Paris, Caesar's Palace, a few nice hotels. \n\nThe luggage guy brought our bags up and showed us how everything worked in our room. Including the tv that was built into the mirror in the bathroom. I admit, I watched it everyday while getting ready and while taking a bath in their HUGE tub that fits 2 people, with your legs fully extended! My husband and I took a bath with their lavender bath salts every night and we were both able to sit in there, without having to bend our knees. \n\nThe pool is really nice and isn't too busy. There's two outdoor pools and one in the spa area. We were there, lounging by the pool everyday, having drinks. It was really nice. I loved every bit of it. \n\nThe sky lounge upstairs is really cool and has great views of Vegas. We ended up going to the lounge both nights, we liked it so much. \n\nThe tea lounge is a little pricey for the english high tea for what you get, but it was fun to enjoy it with my family. \n\nThe service was wonderful and the place was immaculate. I think I found my \"IT\" place to stay when I'm in Vegas. I can see why they call this place the Zen City. They said that the place was fully booked but it was always so quiet! \n\nBest of all, it's located in City Center, my favorite area of Vegas.
