A beautiful garden in the middle of the strip. For reals?\n\nI'm not one to normally gush over flowers or the graceful beauty of foliage sculptures, but this place is quite impressive. I decided to stop here after a meeting with some friends at the Bellagio. I've read a lot about this place and wanted to see what all the hype was about. \n\nThe first thing you notice is the sweet smell of fresh flowers; it's not subtle, but not overpowering, this is a welcoming smell after walking through the casino floor. Seriously though, why does almost every casino floor have a faint fart smell mixed in with cigarette smoke? Anyway, back to the flowers. \n\nThe Botanical Garden is highlighting the warmer months with a \"Summer Garden Party\", theme. Which is decorated perfectly with giant 15ft flowers, life-sized snails and frogs made of living plants, a giant treehouse for kids, plus a small aviary with all types of live birds. It's really cool see all this in the middle of the bustling casino on the strip. Great place to take family members who are visiting you and aren't of the pool party, clubbing hopping variety. \n\nThe Conservatory & Botanical Garden is a seasonal attraction, so if you haven't made it down here for the garden set-up, hurry! Because this will be ending on September 7th, with the fall theme replacing it on September 13th called, \"Autumn Harvest\". I can already taste the pumpkin spiced lattes!
