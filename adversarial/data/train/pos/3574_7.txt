I ordered via Uber Eats and it came to $30 for General Tao and some shrimp fried rice.  Price is a little high, but takeout would ease that total.\n\nI'm not gonna sit here and pretend the food wasn't phenomenal.  Twas the real deal authentic chinese food (americanized obv).  I could taste the sesame oil.  There was only one giblet of rubbery fat but i flinged it to my cat so it is OK.  It also tasted great as leftovers.  I had it for breakfast.  Portion size was generous. I like that.  General Tao was SLIME FREE! (lookin at you tiki ming!) I like that.\n\nMy one gripe is that I didn't get a soy sauce packet or a chili packet.  At first I thought there had been some terrible mistake. You mean to tell me, you gave me the plum sauce packet for the spring roll, but you didn't grab the-- Okay. I'll take responsibility for not asking for extra packets, but how could you not hook me up with AT LEAST ONE soy sauce packet??? That light skinned fried rice needed the assistance.   \n\nFortunately, I had an emergency packet in my purse AND a handful of chilli packets I got from China Wok when the man's head was turned around cuz I was using the debit machine Sorry, yeah I did that, and I'll probably do it again. you KNOW those stupid no frills sri rachas DONT taste the same a those delicious wings chili sauce packets!  I called their corporate headquarters and I'd have to buy like 10,000 if I wanna purchase my own which isn't a problem at all, it's just the TAXES you gotta think of the TAXES! and the S&H.\n\nAnyway, you still get 5 stars because UBER only charged my $20. I guess as an introductory savings. Will order again.\n\n5 stars!
