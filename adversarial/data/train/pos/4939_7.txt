Let me tell you FINALLY a great groomer in Las Vegas. Coming from Cali my dog always went to the best and every few weeks. Since living here in Vegas- I've been everywhere, no such luck. And this is the place! \nThey take their time, but yet don't let your dog sit in a cage forever or at all. Perfect cut and clean as a whistle. \nThey make cutest bows and even have certain medicated bath options for your dogs skin. My dog being so old, has had moles or other types of skin allergies. So when I would visit the vet a couple times a year they would cut these thing off and charge me, as they came back. BUT this medicated bath option has completely changed that for my dog and his skin has been at it's best. So if your not worried about the extra dollar then I highly recommend adding their treatment they offer. As the prices here are more then fair! I am very happy and so is my doggie they are great!
