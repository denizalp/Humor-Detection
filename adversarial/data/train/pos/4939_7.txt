Wow it was crowded! I guess that's a normal day at the Apple store. I came here to buy a case for my 15\" MacBook Pro. I was thinking between a soft pink case or a gray one and after 20 minutes of discussing the pros and cons I chose the gray one from Incase. Price was around $70. While waiting to make my purchase I browsed around and tried some apple watches and looked at some accessories for my laptop and IPhone. In total I was satisfied with my visit. Customer service was excellent and friendly.
