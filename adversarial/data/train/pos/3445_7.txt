I was definitely skeptical when I first arrived to this hole in the wall restaurant adjacent to an industrial strip mall. A place with \"Noodle House\" in their name is usually an indicator of an unauthentic Asian restaurant.\n\nI walked in and immediately noticed that the servers were all Thai. Phew.\n\nI read some pretty mixed reviews of the Pad Thai and honestly it's pretty good. A tad on the sweet side, but good and GENEROUSLY PORTIONED nonetheless. The noodles don't stick together unless you order it to go and let it sit out. I would definitely come back to try their other menu items! Plus, everything is so cheap, go give it a shot!
