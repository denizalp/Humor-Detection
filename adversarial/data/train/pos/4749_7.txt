the only redeeming quality is their driving range, otherwise they would only get ONE STAR. it has a bunch of different \"targets\" to shoot at and is better than just a standard flat range.\n\nother than that, STAY AWAY!!!!\n\nthe interior smells absolutely disgusting. the few times i went it smelled the same so it wasnt just some isolated incident like a sewage leak or dead animal.\n\nWORST MINI-GOLF course ever! every hole is flat and as boring as playing in my kitchen. the astroturf is all ripped up and even the cement around the holes is crumbling. \n\ni commend the yelper below who was able to take one for the team and try their food, something i couldnt even imagine making my ex-gf do. anyways, thats beside the point. on the other hand, maybe he has a screw loose for even attempting the food here. \n\ni had to go home and take two showers after spending some time here.
