Really liked Gyro meat.\n\nI came here to pick up lunch to go yesterday, really likes the gyro I ordered. Like other good Greek restaurant, takes time to have food ready. They make food after we order.\n\nGyro sandwich had a really good flavor and generous portion. I actually couldn't finish everything. A combo meal comes with fries, $1 more fit seasoned fries. \n\nSince I was eating at a park and didn't want to mess with ketchup, I decided to try their seasoned fries. It had a nice seasoning to it, glad I upgraded to seasoned fries.\n\nThey had other dishes I wanted to try, namely falafel.. Looking forward to coming back to try more of their food
