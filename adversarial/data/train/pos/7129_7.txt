Went here with a group of people (girls & guys) a few times and it was a disappointment each time. The waitresses are annoying and keep pushing customers to drink. Once you enter you suddenly get disappointed; no light shows, empty, dirty and depressing. The washrooms were filthy and poorly maintained. The girls were more focused on squeezing cash out of people's pockets than they were on the aspect of entertainment. All the attention is congregated in one small and specific area; the stage. The stage was a joke and so was the interior design. If this place renovated, trained their staff efficiently, the employees actually worked for the money, invested into better lighting and entertainment then I would consider returning.\n\nProbably the best part of my nights there was getting food from the hotdog stand.\n\nI live 2 minutes away from this place and i would rather go to a downtown strip club. The female bartenders\/waitresses at a local pub provide more entertainment than these strippers.
