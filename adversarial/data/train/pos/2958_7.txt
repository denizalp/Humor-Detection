cuppa cuppa!! cuppa!!\nI LOVE THIS PLACE. the first time i experienced Holley's was when I was across the way getting my nails done. My friend decided to go grab something to drink while waiting for me and she came back with the most delicious drink I've ever had. She got a large iced chai tea latte and it is some bomb.com. After trying it she downed it so I did get much more. A week or so later I came back to grab the same chai tea and went through the drive thru. The people there were super nice and very quick. I don't think I've ever spent more than 1-2 minutes waiting in line or for my drinks. I then introduced it to my friend and she is bonkers for them too!! They use big train chai tea with whole milk, i had to ask for there secrets but i still stop by once a week. it is my current addiction. they also have different breakfast bagels, sandwiches, and bars. I've tried there breakfast bagel with bacon, egg, and cheese. It was huge! Also my friend tried their blueberry muffin. She said it was too sweet, so I took a bite. The top has some kind of sugar coating that I personally like, so I ate the top for her. :) Definitely a place I would recommend to try. So in closing to wake me up bring me an iced chai tea late please!
