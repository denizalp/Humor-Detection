Graveyard special? Ass juice? Bacon Martini? I love it! Where else can you get a co-existence of every type of person from the social spectrum all packed into the same place and everyone gets along just fine?\n\nThis bar is right on the footstep of the UNLV campus in what a cab driver once told me was the \"Fruit Loop\", nearby some gay bars.\n\nAfter my second or third day here I convinced my boss to try a bacon martini with me. I asked him what was in it and the bartender replied \"Bacon and Vodka, of course!\".\n\nIt was probably the most disgusting thing I ever drank and it took me about 40 minutes to finish. My boss was able to just take the pain and gulp it down quickly. The massive amounts of PBR I drank to wash it down just intensified the taste exponentially.  The wax feeling on your lips, the little floating pieces in the martini, everything about it was surreal. Christ, I can't wait to experience that again.\n\nThey have a sign that says \"You puke, you clean it\" or something very close if I remember, and a sign next to it \"Puke insurance, $20\". Be sure to get the Graveyard Special.\n\nAnother cool thing was they actually comped a couple of PBR's for me because I had played like $1 in the built-in video blackjack on the bar.\n\nSometimes at night, when it's quiet, I can hear this place calling my name.
