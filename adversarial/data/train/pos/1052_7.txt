Excellent experience.  I stopped by one day, wandered around the store, found what I wanted, left, went home, priced it on the internet, found out it was a good price, returned a few days later.  I was greeted by a salesman, told him what I wanted, used the Yelp free delivery plus 10% off for cash and was out the door in 15 minutes.  Delivery was quick and easy although they showed up 30 minutes before the time window I was given but luckily I was home.\nWhat is keeping this place from 4 stars?  1) when I was there the first time, I wasn't approached by anyone even though I walked past several employees who were lounging around.  Had someone approached me I might have made my purchase right there.  2) There is something off about the place.  The card I was given had \"sales manager\" crossed out and the email didn't work.  They had to go in the back to get change.  Still, they delivered exactly what I ordered for a good price on the date they stated they would and it is such a comfy couch!
