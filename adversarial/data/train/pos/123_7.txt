My a\/c went out so I took it here to recharge the freon, they conned me into doing the evac check freon for $89, a little more than the advertised $29.99...ok. The owner, Jason, even offered to take me back to work while he looks at my car. Wow I thought, this place is really good, didnt know that ride was gonna cost me thousands...shoulda called discount cab LOL. Okay, so here's the story; he called me at work and said my compressor was bad, had to be replaced $1,900 + labor = ~$2,400  (Whaaaat!)\nOf course I said I had to wait on the repair due to lack of $$$. On my next oil change I went to Car Guy which is right next door to Choice Transmission. Gene at Car Guy changed my oil for $18.99, fixed my a\/c problem for under $150!!! That's what I call an honest mechanic! So make a choice...don't go to Choice Transmission! (Jason, how do you sleep at night?)
