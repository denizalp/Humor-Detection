With the exception of coffee, even though I had all the ingredients for a perfectly acceptable breakfast, e.g. cereal, oatmeal, milk, o.j., bread, eggs, I opted to treat myself to a pastry...or 2!  ;)\n\nAn almond croissant (approx. 6-7\", I measured it!), a lemon coconut square (pretty substantial in size as well), 2 macaroons, & a cafe au lait was just over $11.  Not bad with everything costing around $2, macaroons (a few small bites large) were $1.75ea.\n\nMaybe it's 'cause of my previous, not so great experiences, but I'm NOT a huge fan of macaroons.  However, the ones that I got (Guava + Passionfruit\/Chocolate) actually tasted like their flavours.  From another bakery which is normally great, I've had ones that tasted like a stale fridge!  So for the quality\/taste, it's a decent value!  Again, I don't see the big whoop about macaroons, so maybe I don't even know how they're supposed to taste.\n\nAlmond Croissant was soft and tender, unlike those ones that you buy from the grocery store that are hard and probably made with God-knows-what.  Highly recommended for those of you who like croissants!\n\nI have yet to break into the lemon square, but again, it's totally shareable for 2ppl.  Caf√© au lait was great.  I can't wait to try out the cakes, but I'm waiting for an occasion!\n\nSoo lucky to have a bakery of this calibre nearby!
