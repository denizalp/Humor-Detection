You can delete my reviews but you can't silence the truth, your customer service is quite awful.  I'll be nice and hope that you guys can turn yourselves around by giving you a TWO star review to raise your really low score already.  BTW, Yelp really doesn't help your cause so you guys should just delete the company profile.
