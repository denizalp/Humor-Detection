So I finally broke down and tried Grimaldi's pizza. One thing I've learned about living in the Phoenix area is to never have high expectations for any restaurant, that way, you'll never leave disappointed. Grimaldi's fulfilled my low expectations and was mediocre in every way.\n\nTo start, the pizza crust was good, crispy throughout and bubbled up around the edges, as one would expect from a brick oven pizza. However, there was no discernible flavor to the crust, so, who cares.\n\nNow for the sauce. The most bland, flavorless, nothing of a sauce that makes a person wonder if the chef understands that there is something called \"spices\" that can be added to food to enhance flavor. Whatever happened to the sauce being the secret to a dish? Here is a note: Oregano, basil, thyme, rosemary, marjoram, etc. are spices that Italians love to use in their food -you should try them. Or maybe just begin with salt and pepper.
