Korean bbq may not be an inexpensive cuisine and for that reason, those of us who love Asian food but try to watch our budgets carefully will tend to gravitate more toward Chinese or Vietnamese. But a bit of a splurge is a good thing every now and then, and this place fits the bill. This was the International Supper Club UYE's pick for November and it was quite a satisfying experience. We came on a weekday evening and it did not take long for us to be seated. Our very friendly server explained the method of ordering, set up our table's grill and within minutes we were were ordering and grilling a variety of items: bulgogi (so good, we ordered it several times), galbi, a number of beef, chicken, and pork preparations in a variety of marinades, plus some cooked items such as glass noodles - all very good. The servers were very efficient and the items were brought to our table very shortly after we ordered them. The restaurant is conveniently located within the Tempe Marketplace. While 25 bucks per person may not make this a place for most people to frequently visit, the quality and quantity of food, the modern casual vibe and the friendliness and efficiency of the staff definitely makes this a great place for treating yourself to a Korean feast once in a while.
