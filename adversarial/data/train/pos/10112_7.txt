For a Giant Eggle the Medina outpost is a pretty good one.  \n\nThey have an ample dessert selection - especially the frozen dessert persuasion.  It made Carl Mikeson happy at least..\n\nThe main reason why I love the Eggle so much is the fuel perks.  If you haven't heard about fuel perks yet - its ok - they're new.  It's when you spend $50 at the Eggle then you get 10 cent off gas at Eggle gas stations.  It works for all purchases, including gift cards to various nationwide merchants, so really one could make all their purchases for everything at Eggle - food, dining out, furniture, clothing, travel, etc - then go get gas, which in turns provides you with money off food (food perks!) Which keeps you coming back - in a circle.  Bam!  Self sustaining economy.  \n\nSeems like a certain pub in Philly can take a page from Giant Eagle (and Dave and Busters).
