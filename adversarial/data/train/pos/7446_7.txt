Warning this review may be a bit graphic for the menfolk so for the squamish I'll suggest  that maybe instead they read another review,   perhaps this? http:\/\/www.yelp.ca\/biz\/the-brass-rail-toronto?rpp=40&sort_by=funny_desc\n\nFor the rest of you that have the balls (sorry I couldn't resist) let's do this!\n\nCondom's are at best a necessary evil.  They smell, they're ackward and they are certainly a buzzkill in the spontaneity department. \nAs hubby and myself became tired of the constant slapstick fumbling and bumbling with prophylactics we decide upon vasectomy as the best option for our marital coital situation.\n\nHubby decided to do his research and was attracted to the fact that Candian's Men Clinic offers the no scalpel and no needle vasectomy method, which is less painful, less invasive and less time consuming with regard to the procedure itself and the recovery downtime.  \n\nThe first visit was a consultation (about 20 minutes) to ensure that hubby is sure that he is making the right decision and he is given a  discussion about all the pros and cons and what to expect of the procedure.  The consult is covered by OHIP, the actual procedure however is not.  Hubby rationalizes that although the scalpel free charges a fee (versus hospitalization vasectomy by a urologist is covered) he feels that in the end the scalpel free will be the best option for himself.\n\nThe clinic itself was very clean and the staff are incredibly pleasant.\nThe day of hubby's vasectomy, he was brought to one of the procedural rooms. Hubby was told to lay on a bed while a sheet was draped across his raised knees to obscure whatever maybe be going on below.  A potent local gel anesthetic was applied to the general area which subsequently completely numbs the groin.  Next a small puncture is made in the scrotum and the doctor fishes out the vas deferens with his fingers. The procedure lasted no more than 30 minutes and breezed along easily as the doctor was cordially chatty and hubby felt so much at ease that he pretty much forgot what he was doing there until he smelt burning flesh  which was actually the good doctor cauterizing the vas deferens to ensure his \"little guys\" don't complete they're mission to try and fertilize my eggs.\n\nAfter the vasectomy there was barely any downtime as the tiny puncture healed so quickly, but hubby still took the day off, perhaps in a show of respect to his bollocks and his now defunct army of sperm.  He did complain of minor phantom groin pains as was discussed by the doctor beforehand, but that was more psychological than physical and dissipated within a few days.  The follow-up from the clinic was great as they sent hubby home with two specimen jars to collect semen samples and be tested at two month intervals to ensure that indeed hubby is now \"shooting blanks\".  Funny enough hubby conveniently kept the yet-to-be-filled sample jars on stand-by next to our PC.... \n\nAll-in-all hubby can't sing enough praises about the Canadian Men's Clinic.  They are professional, efficient and they made a so called dreaded vasectomy experience pretty much a cake walk.  Now our only concern is what to do with our stock pile of condoms?
