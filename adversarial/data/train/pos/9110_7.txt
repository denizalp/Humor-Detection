This ain't your daddy's sushi spot. Cowfish is one of the must-eats in Charlotte. If you're stopping through town and you don't chow at the Cow you might as well just keep on driving. They have a lot of options and variety on the menu. You won't know what to try. The burgushi is a go-to attraction but even the traditional sushi \/ sandwiches are can't miss items.\n\nThe walls are lined with dope artwork that is really funny. I've tried pretty much everything on this menu and it's all worth it. It's a little pricey so come prepared to spend some dough especially if you're drinking alcohol. \n\nThey have great specialty milkshakes as well. Hillary Clinton may not have won but at least we can take solace in the fact that Cowfish still exists in a cruel world where people are marching with tiki torches in the street. \n\nGo try this before North Korea nukes us!
