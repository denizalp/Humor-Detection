TL;DR: World Cup, Mediocre food; Terrible server swore at us. \n\nThough I never expect that much from establishments such as wild wing, this one takes the cake. \nThe one star here is simply to denote that Yelp doesn't allow lower scores. \n\nAmbience: 2\/5\nCame here to watch a world cup game as while other bars were totally packed, wild wing was able to seat 8 (that should have been a red flag, right there). The world cup turns even the slums of Rio into a party, so in parallel, wild wings was a slum-turned-party. \n\nFood: 3\/5\nMediocre, and not cheap. An ice tea, crispy chicken sandwich (with yam fries), and 1 lb wings were pennies under 30$ after tax.\nNothing wrong with the food... just not all that great. Pretty standard for a wild wing.\n\nService: 0\/5 - in fact, -5\/5\nthis one may be my front runner of WORST SERVER EVER! Didn't even catch her name, but keep an eye out for crimped blond hair, thick eye liner, and a lot of lip gloss. \nShe only took orders from one person at a time (despite the fact that she had a note pad). Not even sections of our 8 person group. Only one person. BF and I weren't allowed to order together (though we were sharing), because she said there were too many people in our group. There was a minimum 5 minute wait between order\/ person. \nA few of us asked for water, which she said was not possible because they were out of cups and glasses. When we saw water go out to other tables with other servers, a friend and I went up to the bar to ask for water. The bartender (here on: water-server) gave us an odd look and told us of course they had cups. \nServer never came by to check on us- in fact, water-server took the initiative to drop off a pitcher of water before our actual server ever came back.\nShe complained to the water-server about having to serve us (while standing over our table)- saying it was not fair that she had to serve the big group (notably, there were other 8+ groups there. Split up between the 3 servers). \nThe final topper was while trying to settle the bill, she complained to each of us about how much work it was to split the bill, and how it was not normal to split the bill at wild  wing, and how it make things much more difficult and complicated for her. Then, she miscounted the number of drinks (counting 5 ciders instead of 4). THEN (and here's the kicker) she told my friend who was last to pay that since it was punched in she would have to \"f*cking pay for it [her]self\" and \"someone at the table is a f*cking liar\". I wish I were exaggerating.\nI know wild wing isn't the classiest of joints (and I don't expect it to be) but that seems to be a little much for me. Call me old fashion, but I really don't think it's appropriate to swear at, and complain about customers while they're still sitting in front of you (save that for the back room!).\n\nWater-server told me that the manager\/ owner wasn't in today. And BF picked up our tab, despite my griping about not tipping and leaving a note as to why. So, I guess the best I can do is to put my experience on yelp in an attempt to save other people from Wild Wing on King, and never ever go back. \n\nI hope this server finds something she likes to do more and that this wild wing becomes something a little classier, like a Hooters.
