Amanda verbally abused us as paying guests and called the police on our party for no reason.  She's clearly mentally unwell and unfit for to be anywhere near hospitality.  There's a big open desert not far from you Amanda, go get lost in it and protect future guests from your travesty of a personality.  \n\nAmanda was the most unpleasant, rude hotel staff person I've ever had the misfortune of meeting. Charged $25 for an early check-in then failed to notify us that our room was ready. Woke up our driver to inform him there's an 8 person limit per hotel room. We have 8 people and 2 hotel rooms. When we informed them of their mistake they kicked us all out and called the police. Apparently the police didn't find Amanda's crack stash in the back office (thank me for the tip later Officers!)
