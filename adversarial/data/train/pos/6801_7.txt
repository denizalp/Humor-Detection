Which wich, why oh why do you only have one location when I could eat so much more of you if you were closer? \nAlso, why did it take so many sandwich shops to finally come up with this FREAKIN\" AMAZING concept? \nYou choose your bag via your choice of meat; turkey, ham, chicken, roast beef etc. Then write down or check off every single thing you want on it! Want balsamic? No problem! How about olive spread? They have that too. Honey mustard AND spicy mustard, YUP- they can pull it off! \nThey also always have a special, most recent was the pastrami. Do yourself a favor and get the VOODOO chips. They taste like barbecue met up with jalapeno and had a salt and vinegar baby. \nReal ice cream shakes, and hot cookies. Do I need to even keep typing? Why are you not there yet? Or at least bookmarking it on Yelp!\nThey have punch cards, with double punch Mondays. Not once have I had to wait long, or experience anything other than stellar service. My only complaint is the one location, far far away. But it's worth the drive, so they will continue to get my business.
