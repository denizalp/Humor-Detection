In my estimation, a company deserves 5 stars when: (1) it delivers exactly the outcome that it promised, (2) it did so advocating stellar customer service, and (3) the price that you pay reflects a balance between industry average and value.  PDR Guy deserves 5 stars, hands down.\n\nNo matter how far away you leave your car in a parking lot, there's always that (synonym for \"jerkhole\") who decides (s)he's going to park his\/her car RIGHT next to yours even though there are 5-10 open spots on either side.  To add insult to injury, you find a nice ding on your door and even though you have $0 deductible for comprehensive coverage; State Farm (boo!!) categorizes it as a collision (WTH...makes no sense that a stationary car that swings its door onto yours is considered \"collision\").  When you have a $500 deductible for collision, all you can do is suck it up and pay for the repair yourself.  Good thing that there are fixes such as paintless ding repair.\n\nStellar customer service.  The steps were effortless and SUPER convenient:\na)  I text PDR Guy pictures of the ding\nb)  He text back promptly a price range of $125-$150 to repair and that he was mobile so could conduct the repair on site (yay, saves me time!)\nc)  His rationale for the higher price was the difficulty of access due to how low the ding was on the door and that Audi uses aluminum or high strength steel, which adds to the difficulty of the repair \nd)  He told me his first available appointment and I confirmed -- all over text\ne)  The day before the appointment, he text to confirm\nf)  On the day of the appointment, he arrived promptly within the time frame\ng)  He inspected the ding in person and gave me an approximately 1-hour time frame to repair\nh)  Within less than 45 minutes, he was done\ni)  He takes cash, check, PayPal or cc payments \n\nPerfect outcome.  The ding vanished; it was as if it had never happened!  I can't tell where the ding was at all anymore.  What he does is gain entry to the panel through little holes and basically suctions the ding out.  It's a relatively inexpensive way to repair those stupid dings without having to pay a body shop to pull the panel off or repaint.\n\nValue.  Even though he quoted $150, he only charged me $125.  It says a lot about a company's honesty when they charge you on the low end of their estimate because they had the discretion to charge the upper end (this is in contrast to my review on the Audi of Charlotte's service department, where they underestimated and overcharged simply because they could).  Further, living in Uptown, he got the parking situation confused and ended up initially parking in a place that my building didn't validate.  I offered to pay for his parking but he politely declined.  \n\nOther PDR estimates I received were right at $125 but I went with him because he took the time to explain the rationale behind his quote, which gave me assurance that he is familiar with Audis and would conduct an expert repair (I've learned that sometimes choosing the lowest price doesn't always save you money).  Considering that I only paid $125 to have an expert remove the door ding from my car and it is restored to its former immaculate glory, I derived every bit of value in what I paid.\n\nWhen it comes to services, it can be like a box of chocolates, you never know what you're going to get; but I can say with certitude, that if you get a ding on your luxury vehicle, call PDR Guy.  He's honest, fair, and expertly does his job with pride in his workmanship.
