I normally hate Popcorn shops because a) they tend to be extremely overpriced and 2) they always make you buy too much popcorn so that you end up wasting a lot of it.\n\nPopped seems different.  There are economical (I am sure with a large profit margin) portions (small bag $3.00-$5.00, small container $4.00 - $6.00) and they have an easy to follow \"menu\" showing the different kinds of popcorn and the prices associated with them.  The theme seems to be movie based and it works. We tried the salt and vinegar (not my fave), white cheddar (give me more), Ranch (everyone else loved this one, I personally hate all things ranch), and several chocolate varieties which were excellent.  \n\nThe only reason this place doesn't get that elusive 5th star is because they don't offer affordable options for mixing flavors.  Even a small sampler wheel like other establishments would have been nice.  They do have a 3 popcorn option where they put a divider into a tin.  They will mix more flavors in but some will have to touch.  The benefit of the 3 flavor tin is it is priced at the average price of the three flavors so if you get one of each price level, you pay the middle price.  Still, I wanted to take home a sampling of all their flavors and they could not accomodate.
