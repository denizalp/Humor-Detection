I was referred to go in to see Dan Hering  after spending almost a year with a cough and being treated for everything under the sun!  And having every test possible!!!\n\nThen I was told they found something in my left lung. I do not smoke so I could not understand what they could possibly have found!\n\nWell I had a Dr. Who was not giving up on finding out what it could be! She treated with with Steroids and my cough started to go away. They said I actually have Emphysema!!!!??? Are you serious?\n\nWell I came to this office and had to do breathing test. Uggh I hated that part of going here! I could not get a good deep breath that she wanted me to do and I had to redo it a bunch of times till she finally got the results she wanted for the Dr.\nThe results were not bad after just being treated with the steroids I guess I am alive and breathing good! lol so far!!!\n\nDan was very nice. He was very understanding , spent time listening to what I have been through and was not in any hurry to leave the room. \n\nBecause I have allergies Dan wanted me to now wait till Feb sometime to go back for a Cat Scan of my Lungs to see if they have changed at all. Of course living in Nevada a lot of people have allergies and these things can happen as well as occupational as well. \n\nI am just hoping that when I go back for the CT he will say it is nothing to worry about!!\nI highly recommend if you need to see someone come see Dan!
