When whoever writes Ke$ha's songs wrote the lyrics for Take It Off (\"There's a place down town where the freaks all come around\"), I'm sure they were writing about Pure.  \n\nAfter waiting in line for almost two hours, my friends and I got into Pure for free using those little VIP passes they hand out around the casino.  The place was so packed we could barely move.  Upon entering, we spotted this doped up cougar lady in a skimpy top and tight pants dancing alone.  We thought she was pretty gross but kind of entertaining.  A while later we saw her again.  Only this time, her boobs were hanging out of her top and some man was licking her nipples.  Looks like Pure really lives up to its name!
