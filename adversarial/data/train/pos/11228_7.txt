This opened sometime in the last few months. I had always gone to the one in Chinatown mostly because they carried the brand of Kalbi sauce that I like. This one on Maryland Parkway just north of Seafood City is larger, cleaner, and has an extensive selection of asian foods and products.\n\nThe meat and seafood areas are bigger with more selection. They even have a few restaurant style places to eat, dimsum, filipino, vietnamese foods, and a bakery. \n\nI like the variety here. Prices are still a bit high but you can locate some deals. You can join their rewards club as well for getting a few deals and saving some bucks.
