Sometimes you want cheap fast food Italian. And sometimes Fazoli's can be just what you need. But then there are nights like I had on my last visit where the food tasted like high school cafeteria food. Bleech. \n\nThankfully their breadsticks never suck and if you order a dozen of 'em at least you can give the dog the rest of the food and your stomach has something to keep it from growling. \n\n2 Stars: Only because the breadsticks saved them from a 1 Star and placement on my \"It's so bad my dog wouldn't eat it list\". Because truth be told the dog didn't eat the ultimate sampler platter either.\n\nAnd as bad as Fazoli's can be, even at their very worst they still beat going to Napoli across the street as that place is unfit for human consumption.
