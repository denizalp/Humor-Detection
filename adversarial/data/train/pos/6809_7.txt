Yelp's 365 Review Challenge 2015 #10 - #365\n\nIf you're looking to have a taste of tacky Vegas themed restaurant then JJ's is your best bet to have some Parisian eats.  Around breakfast time, the lines can be long but moves quickly. It's right across from the Le Village Buffet and offers fake outdoor patio seating. My favorite food to order besides the fruity danish and fruity desserts is the smoked salmon baguette. Having had the smoked salmon baguette just wants to wisp you away to Paris France. \n\nI wish other resorts like Treasure Island, Mirage, Luxor and Excalibur can follow what Paris still holds to its theme. I'm talking about restaurants that fit in with the hotel theme. But anyways, JJ's will always be my go to Parisian eatery at the Paris Hotel. \n\nI would like to also add that I am a huge fan of their fruit tarts, French eclairs and decadent chocolates.
