It really pains me to give this place one star.\n\nI used to come here pretty often since I liked their dolsot bibimbap. But it was all undone. It was a cloudy day, so I figured some soup was in order. I got the dumpling and rice cake soup. Here were the problems.\n\n1. Half the dumplings were split open and the filling was floating around in the soup. I tried to pick up the other half (which appeared intact), and whether it was with chopsticks or spoon, it'd fall apart as well. Clearly, these were way overcooked. Despite at times, forgetting that I left the stove on, I've never managed to overcook my dumplings, so this is pretty impressive feat.\n\n2. There was no rice cake. I explained to the server that my dish came with rice cakes. She and I argued for a couple minutes. I pointed it out on the menu that it did and this ended all debate. A few minutes later, she came out with a small bowl of plain boiled rice cakes, which I added to my soup. \n\n3. Towards the end of the meal, I saw something floating in my soup. A piece of saran wrap plastic about 1x1 cm (0.4x0.4 inches, for you imperialists). I pulled it out and my friend said yep, it's plastic. This was the straw that broke the camel's back, and hence why I feel extra compelled to write this review.\n\nI'm definitely not coming back. The food, service and cleanliness is just way too questionable for me to tolerate.
