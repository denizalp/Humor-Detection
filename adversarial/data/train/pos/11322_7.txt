Woohoo! Another cuisine I can cross off my foodie bucket list. \n\nCafe De Taj is in a tiny plaza on the corner of Danforth Ave. and Danforth Rd. As soon as I walked in I could smell some amazing cook working their kitchen magic with some exotic spices AH YES! \n\nPretty roomy with booths and tables good for big groups, and even a playroom for the kiddos. Simple decor but I loved the texture and design of the walls in the dining room and women's washroom.\n\nTold the hostess\/waitress\/cashier I've never tried Bangladeshi food before so she suggested the Chicken Roast+Polau+(hard boiled) Egg and the Bhuna Khichuri + Beef. So grateful they had free Wifi to keep me busy during the short wait. \n\nTried the Chicken Roast first. Oh my! It was absolutely delicious! There were two pieces of tender chicken covered in a thick, delectable, medium spicy sauce; hubby and I devoured it all! The Pulao (rice pilaf) was bland and I didn't care for the hard boiled egg. Next was the Bhuna Khichuri + Beef; it was just ok. The beef was swimming in oil, so I had to fish out the chunks and put them on top of the Bhuna Khichuri (rice and lentils). The Beef was totally overshadowed by the chicken roast. Next time I will order the Chicken roast with the more flavorful Bhuna Khichuri rice.\n\nI will be back to try out more menu items so I can bump up their rating, but in the meantime I'll give it a solid 3 stars.
