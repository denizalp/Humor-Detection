DO NOT ORDER ONLINE!!!!  \n\nAfter waiting 1 hour and 10 minutes for a day time delivery I called the business and the person that answered said that it takes 20 minutes for the order to get sent to them from the online service. This is strange because about 10 minutes after I placed the order the business called me about a question on the order. So they had my order. Just a Bullshit excuse. My 6 year old tells better lies. \n\nThe pizzas that were delivered were warm, not hot. They were ok. Way better than the big chains. I would have given them 4 stars if they hadn't bullshitted me about the delays.
