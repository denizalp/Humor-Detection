I have been to Scramble a few times. I ordered the Brizza,  which is the breakfast pizza and the French Toast. Each time I went the food was pretty good and it didn't take very long for it to be brought to our tables. Despite the enormous amount of patrons on the patio, I don't think the food is THAT amazing. Lol sometimes I think it's just for show.\n\nAnyhow, The only thing I don't like about this place is that dogs are allowed on the patio where you eat. It's a bit unsanitary in my opinion.  I know there are people who will go on and on about animals being cleaner, but who cares. If you can't be without Fido, take it to go maybe. I like dogs, but eating with them is another story.
