I've flown in and out of Pittsburgh International Airport many times, developing an appreciation for its high's and a disdain for it's lows.  On the plus side, both parking and rental car operations aren't needlessly complicated or difficult to find.  The terminals are clean and well-lit.  Food options are well ahead of the pack, and not necessarily overpriced.  Unless there is snow or ice, or your destination airport is slowed, they are pretty good about getting planes in the air within reasonable proximity of schedules.  WiFi is free, but isn't always working.  The downside is also long.  Movement between buildings is via a subway system which always seems to be slower than it should be, using the similar arrangement at Atlanta-Hartsfield as a point-of-reference.  Security layout is pitiful, concentrating all passengers to a single TSA area.  Once that area backs-up, the wait can be endless.  Unlike other newer airports which mix shops and restaurants between their airline gates, the walk to your gate is much longer than it should be.  One of my old coworkers described PIA as \"a shopping mall with an airport attached!\"  On balance, adequate as an airport, very good as a commercial or fast food destination and not one of my favorites.
