This restaurant is absolutely perfect!  Old school Southern hospitality that makes you yearn for the days when Charlotte was a medium size Southern city with manners and grace.  Now that that era is irretrievably lost, it is nice to have a place to visit that reminds you of that time.\n\nNow for the food.  The steaks are very good.  If you are on a budget and order the sirloin, don't complain when the steak isn't as good as the last place you ordered a filet or a New York Strip.  One of the other reviewers complained that the steak they had at Upstream was better.  Hmm, to me it's odd that anyone would go to Upstream and even order a steak (hint:  it's named Upstream for a reason....)  In any case, Upstream doesn't offer a sirloin cut, so it's not an apples to apples comparison.  So, if you really want a wonderfully prepared, perfectly cooked steak, order the Cowboy Ribeye...thick and juicy and fabulous!  If you want to go on the cheap and eat the sirloin cut, pick one up at Harris Teeter and eat at home, or drop by Outback, Long Horn etc...\n\nAs to the atmosphere...wonderfully dark and private.  Is the decor plush?  No.  Is it conducive to relaxation and dining?  Indubitably so!!\n\nThe waitresses are indeed happy to be there and eager to please.  As someone else noticed, this is also a rarity these days.\n\nIn summary, the Ranch House is a great experience!  If you're old school Charlotte, you probably already know this.  If you are a gold chain wearing sort and\/or come from someplace where rudeness and misplaced arrogance is considered a birthright, why not leave that attitude in your car?  In fact , that's good advice as you travel all over the Carolinas.
