Looks like the secret is out and the long lines at 2:00am are there to prove it! \n\nI came here this past weekend after another shitty night at Marquee dealing with douchey, good for nothing bouncers. Coming to this Secret Pizza joint was the highlight of my night. I got a slice of the combination pizza and as I took my first bite, I regretted only ordering one slice. The pizza was extremely crispy from beginning to end and the meat was quality! \n\nNot only did I get to eat AMAZING pizza, but I met Jason, a bachelor celebrating his last days of freedom, who then ended up being my fake fiance for a couple of minutes. I also met another guy who dared me to do a cartwheel, but instead I tricked him into doing cartwheel down the hall for everyone's amusement. All of this made the waiting in line part a billion times more bearable, so the next time you're here make friends with the people in line to kill the time. \n\nDon't hesitate to come here..the first thought after leaving Marquee should be to venture to this awesome spot.
