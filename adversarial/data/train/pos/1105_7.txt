Rompah-and-a-Stompah\n\nI'm all for endless meat!! Yes, it even makes me do a little dance when it's crazy delicious. Though Pampas does not come close to my favorite Churrascaria it sure did hit the spot for our first Vegas dinner of our poppin' weekend! \n\nHighlights & Low-lights:\n\n*The service was a little spotty yet descent \n*The \"gauchos\" don't come around as much as I'd  like. I guess its because not everyone does the all you can eat. \n*Side\/Salad bar was fair with a variety of different meat accompaniments\n*YAYs: Filet Mignon (to die for), Top Sirloin, Pineapple, & fried plantains!\n*For whatever reason I got a lot of fatty pieces of meat :(\n*Their meat needs more seasoning, damnit (and I despise salt)\n*Seafood options!!\n\nThis place is alright. I wouldn't mind coming back here if someone suggests it. A-OK for you Pampas!
