I stopped by The Hipp on a late Saturday afternoon to get some grub with my boyfriend.  Located in Mid Town Cleveland, next door to the Agora, in a space that has housed numerous other restaurants, The Hipp is in a part of town that could be described as in transition.  There are plans for more businesses, etc. to move in, but right now, it's not all that happening of an area.  Although it was the restaurant's opening week, I was surprised to find that we were the only patrons.  But that was fine.  More attention for us.\n\nJust like The Hipp's sister food truck - Umami Moto - there are plenty of vegan and vegetarian options.  I decided on the vegan carrot ginger bisque and an eggplant sammie.  The soup was absolutely incredible.  It was the perfect mix of carrot and ginger.  Some restaurants can be a little heavy handed with the ginger, but this soup was perfect.  My sandwich was delicious, if not overwhelming.  It consisted of fried strips of eggplant (but not the greasy kind you're imagining from an Italian restaurant) topped with the best roasted red peppers I've ever eaten.  The portion size was huge and the sandwich was accompanied by chips.  The sandwich was actually so large that I had a hard time eating it and I had to deconstruct it in order to prevent it from landing in my lap.  That's not a complaint.  I think the portion size was excellent for the money, actually.\n\nMy boyfriend had a tuna blt that he's still drooling over, days later.  \n\nI'd definitely go back to The Hipp to try out more of their menu.  They have a happy hour that I'd like to check out, if I can make it from the east side in time. (although they do have happy hour on Saturday, also!) This restaurant is definitely worth checking out if you live\/work in the area or are just looking for something a little different to try.
