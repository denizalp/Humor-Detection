i like the people at hotz's.  they are really nice.  \nthis is the type of bar where everyone knows everyone, and there's really a sense of community.\n\na community of beer drinking, good time-having, fun people.\n\nand hey- i guess that even includes the dude that came up to my friends and myself on my birthday that was the most entertaining drunk dude ever, i think.
