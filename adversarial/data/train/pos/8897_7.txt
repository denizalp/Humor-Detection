So. Much. Fun! Top Golf is an amazing venue for a group to get together and have a good time. We came here last night and truly enjoyed it. Our server Janet was awesome! We had a whole spread which was cool. We started out with the Yellowtail Sashimi, and a few sushi rolls. All were absolutely phenomenal. Then they brought out the mother of all bbq platters... It was so freaking good! I had the pulled pork and sausages. I dont know what they put in their sausages to make them so good but they were the best. \nBetween the great service, view, and food we will definitely be back. \n\nPS you dont have the be the best golfer in the world to have fun, this was the first time I ever hit a goldf ball and still had fun :)
