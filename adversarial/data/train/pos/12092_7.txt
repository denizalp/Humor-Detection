Burger 1 star\nFries 5 stars\nMilkshake 5 stars\n\nI was super excited to try this place since it has two of the things I love: burgers and shake. Pictures looked so promising, and sneaking at the burger menu made me drool before even going there.\n\nMy friends and I arrived first thing in the morning when they opened and were seated outside (pro tip: don't sit outside after 12, it's gonna be hot af).\n\nI am sad to report that the burgers were not good at all. We ordered the following: truffle wagyu burger, chili cheese burger, Greg norman wagyu burger, and wagyu salad. Even though we all ordered medium rare, the patties came not only well done but supppper dry. Seriously, that was the driest burger patty I've ever had, even fast food restaurant patties are juicier (-_-).\n\nRedemption points were the fries and the crazy milkshakes thankfully! We finished our fries and ordered Cookies and Cream Crazy Milkshake. Oh boy, that thing looked intimidating at first, but we tackled it like nothing. I know you are only getting it for your IG and yelp photos, so make sure to take those photos fassst because the glorious toppings melt off pretty quickly!\n\nI might come back if I feel like I want to have a heart attack and diabetes - because those shakes are yummy and picture worthy :)
