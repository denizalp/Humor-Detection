WOWEE!!! Their chicken wings are HUGE and MEATY and flavorful!! WINNER WINGS!!! I like a little more sauce and will probably request just a tad tiny extra next time! There is plenty for most, I just like a bit more so, if you are like me, just request a little extra sauce.\n\nThe Philly steak is highly recommended, and probably one of the better ones we have had! The onion rings are hand breaded, not crappy frozen store bought ones!! Very unique and very yummy!\n\nOH, the hot dog!! Crisp skin?? Who knew? Not me!! The skin is crisp!! This hot dog is not your Ma Ma's hot dog!! It's not even your Daddy's hot dog on the grill in the back yard! Get one, or two, but don't miss out on the other amazing food! Take one home instead!!\n\nI had a chance to chat with the owner for a few minutes. They moved here recently from Buffalo. The family moved her to fulfill dad's dream. His dream will come true as far as I am concerned!! This is truly family owned. The son and dad work it, and on the weekends, mom and grand kids help out too!!\n\nWe will WITHOUT DOUBT be coming back for MORE, MORE, MORE!! \n\nGreat job!! Open only a few weeks and they have almost 20 awesome reviews...FOR A REASON PEOPLE!!!! \n\nTake NOTE that these awesome reviews are mostly from people who have LOTS of reviews, reviews that can be trusted, not just friends and family posting reviews!! Give it a try!!!\n\nLMAO at the one star reviewer!! He must own a competing restaurant in the area!! How can he complain of a BRAND NEW RESTAURANT having \"old oil\"??? How can he, the ONLY ONE, say that the food is \"no good\"??? FAKE REVIEW ALERT!!!!
