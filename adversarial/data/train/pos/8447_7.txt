It has been a long time since I have done a Giants road trip.  And after yesterday's game it will be a long time before I go again.\n\nIt is a very nice stadium, we had a beautiful sunny afternoon and lots of Giant fans in the house.  We had family from Charlotte and family actually flew in from AZ to attend the game.  Too bad the Giants didn't show up like the fans did.\n\nBy halftime we had had enough, it was our chance to get the lay of the land in the stadium and we found a couple of gems.  One was a Beer stand area called Local Carolina beers which had over 20 local craft beers.  We tried the NC Hefeweizen (wheat beer normally served with citrus fruit), the prices were pretty reasonable, $7.50\/$8.50  for a 16 oz which is a lot better than the prices in the NY area.  \n\nNext to the craft beer stand, was a mini sports bar with 6 TVs showing other games being played during that time.\n\nAs other reviews have said parking can be a bit of a pain but we got there early to tailgate and parked about 4 blocks away on Mint Street.\n\nThe people who work in the stadium are all very friendly and really get into entertaining the crowds.  Almost has the feel of a college football game.  I would definitely come back (but not for a Giant game, it was an old fashioned southern a$$ whipping 38-0  OUCH)\n\nWe should have just left after the tailgating. :)
