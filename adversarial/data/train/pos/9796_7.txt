I really hate to be the odd one out in hating on Momofuku because I know how world reknown this is and its suuuuch a big deal in Sydney but ... I think if you're charging these prices in Toronto? U have to really be able to deliver or it'll leave a bad taste in people's mouths. \n\nWe came on the second day of opening. A short wait outside early on in the evening, 530 ish? The door man was super nice. The seating is a bit cramped. The menu is super small, I suppose that's what the noodle bar consists of? We both ordered a ramen dish, one cold, one hot in soup. The cold one is REALLY spicy. The hot one was super super mediocre. They are not bad?? But definitely not worth the $16 ish price tags, I think the ramen at Kenzo on Dundas is 10x better and way cheaper. \n\nWhat urked me the most was ... the wine. If you're going to serve wine at a food establishment ? Please do it properly. They gave me red wine in .., A SHOOTER GLASS. it was ridiculous. I'm not a wine snob?? But I know u do not drink wine out of a shooter glass. I've done it at home when I'm ghetto and broke all wine glasses?? But you dont bloody do that when you're Momofuku and charging $11 for a glass. I brought this to their attention and she said \"we don't do that here\". \n\n.... do what ??? Serve wine properly ?? Anyways if anyone can speak up and defend their shooter-glass-wine tendencies, please enlighten me. \n\nOther then that, it was about $60 or so for two ppl, two drinks, two noodles. No thanks!
