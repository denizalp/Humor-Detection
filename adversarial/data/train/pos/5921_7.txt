I cannot wait for somebody to ask me to recommend a restaurant to them because I will say \"Go to Gordon Ramsay BurGR! You won't regret it\". \n\nMy boyfriend and I came here on Wednesday night around 9:30 and we were seated right away. The host led us to our table and I noticed that there were booth seating. I asked if we could sit at a booth and she said there were none available but they did have half booth\/half open seating which we took.\n\nWe sat for a good 10 minutes before a waitress came over and asked us if anyone had come to our table yet. We said no, and she said she'll get someone right over. A couple of minutes later, I see a waiter and waitress talking, kinda pointing at us. The waiter, I believe his name was Kevin, came over and apologized to us for having to wait. I guess there was confusion as to who would be our waiter\/waitress. Honestly, my boyfriend and I were busy talking so the wait didn't bother us too much.\n\nI ordered the Hell's Kitchen Burger and my boyfriend got the Chanterelle Burger. And we ordered \"Just Fries\" to go with our burgers and the Roasted Jalapeno Poppers for an appetizer. By the way, the Poppers came with a surprise... a good fiery surprise! \n\nI took a bite of my burger and I thought it was absolutely amazing! It was cooked medium well and to perfection. I could see the perfect amount of pink in the meat; it was juicy and full of flavor. And the buns were fresh and soft. I don't think I've ever had a burger that good! Oh, my boyfriend enjoyed his burger as well. The fries were tasty but we were getting really full so we didn't finish them.\n\nOur waiter was so friendly and nice! We could tell he was busy but he took his time to explained to us the interactive drink menu and he checked up on us the right amount of times.\n\nThere are plenty of TV's inside this restaurant... maybe place a bet at the sportsbook and then come here to watch the game while enjoying a delicious burger and cold beer.
