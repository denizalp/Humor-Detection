I really only should give this place 1 star, but for the entertainment value, I will be nice and bump it up one more.  Our friend called and asked us if we wanted to go to here where he was planning on buying stuff for his new house.  He's full blown Italian so we figured he was just going for the traditional gaudy stuff that he has grown up with.\n\nI was disappointed that I had to give them a dollar for \"admission\" and I'm not really sure why.  I also don't remember it being so ghetto, but the last time I was here was like 15 years ago.  We found our friend in the ridiculous statue shop in the corner and began to peruse our gaudy surroundings.  We got bored really quickly and just wandered around.  The best place here was the little kitchen gadget place.  Other than that, it was aisle after aisle of bedazzled obama shirts, scented oil crap, and weird used looking drug store findings.  I did find one gem though.  You can buy a mounted T-Rex bust at one of the shops.  You don't really get better than that.\n\nI will probably never go here again.  We are poor, but I would never waste my money here.
