The only reason the place doesnt get  a5 star rating is because:\n -  parking requires either 2 people (1 person to drive to the front of the store, 1 person to stand to make sure stuffs don't get stolen) or buying only as much as you can carry.  The lot is across from the store\n - the place is tricky! there are some good finds, and cheap buys (for the quality) but also some expensive items and if you're not careful, you'll wind up with a $100 bill like me! it's a trap!\n\nBut the place is great. I like one stop shops. It has organic and non organic and the alternative foods for my diet.  Huge selection of standard items, and non standard items for about the same price you'd get at Big Carrot.  \nI like it because I don't really care to much about organic for certain things, but I'm forced to go to Big Carrot to buy my Earth Harvest non diary, non soy 'butter'. They have it here! And I can buy meats, and regular apples. It's a great combination. \n\nIt's my new go to place for sure. Except that loblaws gives me points :(
