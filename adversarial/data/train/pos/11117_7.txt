Plan on waiting a minimum of 1 hour in the waiting room and then another minimum 45minutes-1hour in the exam room before anyone sees you. The waiting area is always full to the gills with sickies and has a strange odor, like antiseptic & raw sewage. It's a newer complex\/office so no clue where the odor comes from. The exam rooms are small and dingy and look like they were furnished from a garage sale of '70's medical equipment\/posters. If you are there to get a referral for a specialist you'll have to wait for that as well. Took 2 weeks to get me a Gastroenterologist referral. The theme here is wait, wait, wait and your time is worthless. Avoid.
