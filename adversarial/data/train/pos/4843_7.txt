After I moved to Phoenix I swore that I would NEVER set foot in Tom's Tavern even though it's right around the corner from work and would be ideal for post-work drinks. Then a few weeks ago as I was walking to the bank I happened to peek my head in and saw that the place has been completely redone. \nSo after some soul searching and in desperate need of a beer one night, I popped in. I like what they did with the place. The bar is nice with a marble top and some tables and chairs with more seating toward the back.\nThey have some good stuff on tap. I had two glasses of the Sam Adams season and some Onion Rings which came with some tasty sauces. My bartender was a very nice girl from Alaska who I think is called Vicki (sorry if I got it wrong). All of the staff there were very friendly. The Cuban sandwich is also apparently phenomenal because one lady at the bar would not shut up about how great it was.\nThe ONLY thing I would change is that the places is lit too damn brightly. They need to turn it down a notch because I think this place could become a cool post-work hangout and fun weekend place which we all know downtown desperately needs (if you build it, or in this case turn it down, they will come). They just need more intimate lighting because we all know the magic of lots of alcohol and low lighting (until the spell wears off the following morning but we cross that bridge when we get to it, don't we?)\nBut seriously, I like the place, they have my support, I will be back and I encourage all Yelpers to pop in and check it out.
