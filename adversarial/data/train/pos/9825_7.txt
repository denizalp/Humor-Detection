Went there for sushi tonight so I can't comment on the Tappan.\n\nThe decor was crisp and modern. The dining room was clean and spacious. The prices on the menu seemed fair. \n\nMy friend and I each ordered one of the sushi combos and were both very pleased. The presentation of the meal was lovely and we found the taste to be quite good. The staff were all warm and welcoming. Overall we were both very satisfied and plan to go back again.
