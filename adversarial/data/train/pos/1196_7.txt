I would have never heard of this place had it not been for Yelp and my Yelp mentor. The reviews were favorable, so we gave it a shot. We entered through the back door which was a little confusing, as I had never been there and was a little turned around. Enter from the Pecos side and you are golden. I got the carne asada nachos loaded with everything. The small was plenty for me and I can usually pack it away. The meat was tasty and all the other ingredients were fresh. The guacamole was good and they have a nice salsa bar. I would rate Taco y Taco three and a half stars, but have no problem rounding up, as half stars aren't an option. The staff was friendly and offered samples of different meats and the warm cinnamon and milk drink with the funny name.
