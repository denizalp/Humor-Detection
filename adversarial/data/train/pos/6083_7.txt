If you're going to voluntarily inflict yourself with what is effectively a stab wound, at least DO IT RIGHT. Don't be afraid to pay a little more for proper sh*t.\n\nI'd gotten pierced a few times, always with problems, before coming here. Six was friendly, professional, and confident, which really put me at ease. He's clearly really good at what he does, and on top of that, uses top-of-the-line tools. The piercing went really smoothly. I emailed him about a month after I got pierced, because a keloid was popping up (always happens for me with piercings). He responded right away with great advice, and the keloid disappeared within a couple weeks.\n\nSo. F'ing. Impressed.
