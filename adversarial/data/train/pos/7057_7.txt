Located in what seems to be a seedier part of town, Solid Gold is where the locals go to avoid the tourists of downtown.  And as an adult venue, Solid Gold is just solid, nothing worthy of the local recommendations my group and I received, just a place that is worthy of another bachelor party location.\n\nThe parking situation here is really strange, there is no parking lot but rather an alley way.  And if street parking is filled up, one is apparently not allowed to park in the nearby public lots.  Cops were alll over the place that night with one car parked across the street, almost waiting for something to happen. \n\nCover charge here is $5 CAD, which is little compared to the $10-20 of the downtown clubs.  The bouncers here are friendly, just be sure to find one that speaks good English since a lot of staff is so French oriented.  They may attempt to convince you to do VIP for an extra $10CAD more but it's totally not worth it.  The VIP lounge is a more intimate spot to catch dancers doing their thang, but there is little to admire when the place is practically dead (as it was during our experience).  Just hang out downstairs where the show is a lot more lively and the music is 10x better.  And if VIP is really that necessary, just head up after 1AM, the velvet rope is essentially gone by then.\n\nRegarding the dancers, most of them are all over the place in terms of looks and style.  There seems to be a type for all colors of the rainbow and each dance will run you about $15CAD each.  Beware of getting suckered for drinks since they're almost more expensive than the dances themselves.  Definitely try getting here before midnight as the ambiance dies very quickly thereafter.
