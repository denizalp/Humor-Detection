Not sure what the \"RD\" stands for but after eating what they served, it must mean \"Really Disastrous\"! Also, the \"Southern\" portion of the name MUST be referring to Southern Canada because there is NO WAY IN HELL this slop would pass as Southern BBQ in the Northern NY State, let alone in areas of the South. \n\nOrdered \"Deans Bad Habit\" which was a pulled pork and brisket. Ordered a side of grilled vegetables and baked beans. I ordered the \"mild\" sauce on the meat. Holy crap - it was so hot. Like disgustingly hot. Like \"lick Satan's ass\" hot! The vegetables were \"grilled\" alright - they looked and tasted like they cooked them on the grill of a truck! The baked beans showed some signs of hope but alas, they tasted like they were marinated in an old shoe for a month. \n\nPlus side to this dump? The \"Eric Clapton\" live album that played - would have enjoyed some actual \"Southern\" music but I'll take what I can get when facing any meal being served from this kitchen.
