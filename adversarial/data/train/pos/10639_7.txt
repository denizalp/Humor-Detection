I should just move in. I'm here more than any coffee shop and more than the library. The Espresso Royale atmosphere keeps me motivated and is my place when I need to get stuff done. Luckily, they have a punch-card which means your 11th drink is free because man I fill that card up quickly. Double punch Tuesday are my jam.\n\nIn terms of baked goods, the pumpkin chocolate chip bread is addictive. It's portioned up into hearty slices and will keep your tummy happy for even the longest study sesh. \n\nMy most ordered drink is certainly the Ginger Gotu Kola tea. It is a happy drink. One sip of this spicy herbal tea and you'll wonder why you didn't try it sooner. No frills here; just dry some ginger root and you've got the basis for one deliciously decaffeinated cup. In spite of its straightforward nature, this tasty brew is not always executed with the same level of finesse and it's the use of gingko and gotu kola that makes Espresso Royale's version oh so fine. \n\nThey stuff their tea bag with heaps of beautiful dried ginger, then the ginkgo and gotu kola before bringing it to steep, which allows for a rather fragrant drink. When you're feeling that cold coming on, sip on this honeyed up ginger tea and thanks to this trio of super foods watch those sniffles melt away. I can attest. If its banging ginger flavor that you seek or some voodoo cold-fighting magic, grab a cup, swirl in a touch of honey, and experience true ginger tea happiness.\n\nA recent discovery that I've also been digging is the Matcha Green Tea. Rather than the latte, I ask for just the tea and I'm fascinated by it. The generous tablespoon of matcha powder they scoop out transforms my cup of hot water into a beautiful sea of green that smells and tastes like grass. Earthy, unique, and touted as incredibly healthy, this is the drink for me.
