Over the years, I have tried to avoid visiting this Ross because their lines are typically overly slow and their selection has been subpar, compared to other Ross locations. \n\nThe line situation seems to have improved a little bit, based on my last visit. I notice that a lot of Ross' seem to be experimenting with ways to improve the checkout times, which I know had been on my biggest complaints about the chain. They have put up racks for hangers in the line area to encourage customers to take their own purchases off the hangers while they wait. This is something I have always done to help expedite the checkout process and I do see it helped quite a bit. Despite the long line, it moved quickly and efficiently, so I do see improvements.\n\nThe selection was a little better than previous visits as well, so I do see myself coming here more often in the future.
