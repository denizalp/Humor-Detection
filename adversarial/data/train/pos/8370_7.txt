I kind of already knew that I'd love The Vig Uptown- before they even started construction on the building.  They have random specials everyday (Tuesday night- bottle of wine and an appetizer for $20!).\n\nThe AMber scrambler (minus the tortilla, extra spicy) is to die for- move over, Postino brunch.  I've had the hummus as well as some random other items but mostly I'm just in love with the tofu scrambler.  DELICIOUS.\n\nService is always impeccable.  From the hostess, to the water girl- it is pretty consistent.  I may (or may not) have a minor crush on the sweet girl who refills water.  She is cute and efficient.  \n\nWhy I'm giving them a 4-star, rather than a 5-star:  \n-The Sunday Squeeze is too pulpy.\n-My dining mates have complained about the dryness and unspectacularness of the Hangover Helper dish more than once.\n-Mandatory valet for an attached lot.\n\nYou can find me here, often.
