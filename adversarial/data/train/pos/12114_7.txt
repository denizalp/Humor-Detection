The Smith Center is a gorgeous venue that brings top acts and talent to Las Vegas. I finally got to see a performance here (Phantom of the Opera) and it was amazing! Everything feels extravagant and new. I was fortunate to get orchestra seats in Row D, front and center! If you can swing it, I'd definitely recommend getting seats in this area for an optimal viewing experience. For refreshments, there's basic candy for snacks, water bottles (ranging from $3-8), and beer\/wine\/soda. If you're looking for something more substantial, there's wraps and sandwiches upstairs in the Mezzanine Lounge. All in all it was a great experience here and I can't wait to see another show. \n\nPRO TIP: During intermission, make sure you sprint to the restrooms because the lines get crazy long.\n\nYELP 100 CHALLENGE 2017: #20
