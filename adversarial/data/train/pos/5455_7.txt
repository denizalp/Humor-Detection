A lover of Sweet Tomatoes.....Will not be back to this location. It is VERY poorly set up. Unfortunately whoever set this location up was just not a good planner. The spot where you have to wait for a table is in the way of people trying to get to the drinks and hot foods, and also right in front of the exit door. I have been to other locations and found the set up to be way better. Also, the girl who rang us up scolded my husband and I for stepping a little out of line so that my mom could get by us to pay. She was not very friendly. Lastly, I was sad because my reason for going was an ad stating that the monthly special was all of my favs....Tomato soup (very good), Grilled Cheese dippers (gross breadsticks with hard crusted cheese on top, NOTHING like a grilled cheese sandwich) and Peanut Butter Chocolate Chip cookies which we were told that they do not make until after 4pm (we went for lunch). Earth to Sweet Tomatoes, people like to eat cookies before 4pm too!!!
