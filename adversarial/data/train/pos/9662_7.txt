This buffet used to be my #1 in Vegas, I come here every single time when I'm in town.  It just gone downhill so much to a point that it doesn't even worth $20 anymore. \n\nI went there again on Feb 23 based on my previous good experiences on their food selections (I have never had good experiences with their servers though), but this time it's the worst.\n\n1. I don't know if they have a problem with Asian.  They love to group all the Asians in a single corner and give them a lousy server.  My server, once again, had NEVER cleaned up the plates on time, every time when I came back with my food, I needed to push the dirty plates away from the table.  ALso during my dining 1 hour I had to find someone else, to call for my server to refill drinks TWICE.\n\n2. Food is horrible.  I mean, as you can see in the picture, this is what they called \"prime rib\".  I was so shocked and couldn't believe my eyes for a dinner costing $53 you're giving me such bad quality of food.  I then asked the butcher \"may I have a piece that is more red?\" he said \"No!  Next!\" and turned his head away.  I was really really shocked.\n\n3. The crowd of the restaurant had gone downhill too, the gentleman next to me took off his shoes and put his feet on the chair.  When I first asked my server if I could change my seat she said \"1 person 1 table, you already have 1 table\".  I ended up speaking to the ladies at the front to solve the problem.\n\nI'm so sorry, I will NEVER come back again.
