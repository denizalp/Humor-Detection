I stayed here for the first time this past week for 6 days with my boyfriend and some of his family members.\n\nI was told that the tower we stayed in was built later than the others. I'm not sure if that means that any of our appliances and such are better than the older rooms. \n\nPROS\nWe had everything we needed to be comfortable. Nice clean sheets (this is a problem that I've had in other places), towels, everything we could think of to cook basic meals for lunch.. a bit more than the works.\n\nThe room had a really nice decor, which made our stay much more homely. The bed was comfortable.. I slept better than I do at home. I loved the pools, even though I only went twice. I preferred the area with two pools and the rock fountain. The lower one was mostly empty and I didn't have to be around splashing kids much.\n\nWhen requested, items (new towels, soiled towel pickups) would come within minutes.\n\nThe air conditioner worked amazingly. \n\nCONS\nI'm someone who is often barefoot. If you are too, you know that your feet can get dirty easily, but wow, I couldn't be barefoot on the tile ANYWHERE in my room without them turning black within a minute. While the floor appeared to be clean, it is obviously not mopped or sprayed with a tile cleaner regularly, if ever. I found myself turning the shower on to rinse off my feet, which showed blackness, multiple times a day. Gross. I also found someone's clipped toenail in the middle of the floor in a spot where you normally walk. Ok then!\n\nI don't think that a day went by without hearing pounding, knocking, or stomping upstairs directly above us. We heard some guy clearing his throat, coughing and watching tv right through the wall behind our heads in bed as if the wall was paper, BUT at least that didn't last long. During one of our last days, someone was knocking on a door so loudly upstairs that we thought someone was knocking on our door. This was while we were asleep. Argh.\n\nEvery time we needed a luggage cart to easily carry up groceries or our belongings, they were impossible to find.\n\nThere's nowhere to park at night, not at our building anyway, so you have to park kind of far. I'm sure this is an issue for many visitors.\n\nAside from ONE girl who was always cleaning the \"lobby\" of our building, the pool people, security, and drivers, I never once saw another staff member in person. Everything was always over the phone. Weird.\n\nThe little store where you can buy food and snacks near the pools I liked\/the gym\/etc, Scotty Beans, was so overpriced and the food really wasn't that enjoyable. Don't get me wrong!!! The employees there are really nice, I even left a tip during one visit. I tried the pizza, which actually was tasty, but when I got a sandwich, it was soggy with grease and wasn't a panini.... at all. \n\nYou have to pay for wifi. Bummer.\n\nWhistling toilet....\n\nThe lint catcher in the dryer fell out multiple times and eventually bent, leaving me unable to use the dryer before we left. I had to leave with a bunch of wet clothes because it wouldn't stay in place, so the dryer wouldn't stay on.\n\nLast but not least, because it was Memorial Day weekend, they wouldn't allow us to have a late check out. \"Absolutely not.\" I even asked if they would accommodate someone who is disabled (me). Nope. We ended up leaving the night before.\n\n----\nDespite all of the cons, I gave 3 stars because I would stay here again, especially if the floors were actually clean (that was the worst part for me), although it wouldn't be my first choice. A lot of the things I listed were disturbances but they wouldn't keep me away on their own. No place is perfect, I guess they can't improve unless you say that certain things made you unhappy as a guest....\n\nI did also enjoy that South Point was within walking distance. We had a car so it was super easy to get around, but getting to the casino would be convenient for someone without a vehicle.
