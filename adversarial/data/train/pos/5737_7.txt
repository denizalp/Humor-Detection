I wish I could rate this Lowe's a big fat \"ZERO\" because that is what they deserve. The one star is just too kind. \n\nI would not recommend this store to anybody looking to have any sort of installation done. The installation department at this store is just the worst. I tried calling them so many times yesterday after 5 pm and no one from the department would answer the phone. It would ring, and ring, and ring. Several times I called and no one answered. I even asked the operator if anyone from installs was still there and she said yes, and that she can see them. So I asked to be transferred over. This time the phone rang, and rang, and then it went to music. So someone put me on hold without saying a word. Seriously?!?! I was so frustrated with them not answering the phone that I almost drove to the store and try calling them from inside the store. Anyway, I hung up, called back again, and after a long wait, I got an assistant manager.  Maybe the installation department knew it was me calling and they didn't want to answer the phone. Maybe they were trying to avoid me?\n\nThe store is fine with taking your money, but when you have an issue, don't expect them to help. They don't care about you or any issues you have regarding their store or their bad customer service. I honestly don't think they care about getting repeat customers because if they did, they would do a better job at making sure their customers are happy. Also, google \"Lowe's complaints\" and you'll see a lot of bad reviews out there for this company. Spend your hard earned money elsewhere.
