Always a clean spot to pick up some food or supplies.\n\nFrys are located all over Arizona and I haven't seen a messy or dirty location yet!\n\nSome stores have full clothing departments and others are mostly grocery stores. \n\nThis location is a good one with friendly staff and massive selection. \n\nThey even have automotive fuel!
