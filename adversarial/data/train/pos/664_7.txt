A Montr√©al institution! I went when I was a kid, and went back this week to get outfitted for cross country skiing. I was a bit dismayed to discover that they no longer sell secondhand skis, that was such a great service to the community, but in the end I went with new and was super happy with my decision. They offered an excellent price for the whole kit - boots, skis, and poles. They are pretty basic but exactly what I need, lightweight and comfortable and just my size. The service from everyone was friendly, chill, helpful, funny, just great. I love that they have a quality control station where someone makes sure everything you bought is in good working order before you go. And I love how much outdoor equipment they have from Montreal companies. \n\nNow... if it'll just stop raining...
