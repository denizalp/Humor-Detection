We were a group of 7 with reservations at 7:30pm, and because of the slowest\/poorest service that you could imagine, we weren't finished and out the door until 10:45pm.\n\nThe food was above average so at least that is a positive. 3.5 stars \n\nAs far as the service.....zero stars.\nAnytime we wanted to order\/get a refill of water it was our job to find someone and flag them down.  We literally had to beg someone to take our entree orders, and get on our hands and knees for someone to take our dessert order.  At the very least the entree orders came out promptly, but our desserts took 25 minutes to arrive at our table.\n\nThe last straw was when I asked for the manager to let him be aware of the situation, and after waiting 15 minutes he did not bother to come and the waiter apologized for the poor service.  I was shocked at the indifference.\n\nTo top it all off, because the meal took so long we were stuck eating our dessert during blaring music that they turn on at 10pm and the place turns into a night club.\n\nNeedless to say I will not be going back and I will most definitely not recommending this establishment to anyone.
