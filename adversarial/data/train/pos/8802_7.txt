shellac and a great pedicure. they are able to do the shellac (gel nails) on both your manicure and pedicure which is hard to find. i also love the girls working here. \n\nit's a family run business and it's stuck in this random empty shopping center, you would never expect it or see it but it's always packed. \n\nsince i've been trying to hunt down a new salon, this is so far my new favorite and the first one i am making a 2nd visit to. \n\ndefinitely recommend.
