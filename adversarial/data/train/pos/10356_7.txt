I've only had Earl Of Sandwich a couple of times, but never had the Holiday Sandwich-and it's what I've been missing in my life. Holiday Turkey, stuffing, gravy & cranberry sauce, holy mother of sandwiches! Now I dream about it in my sleep thank you very much Christina Y. \n\nIt was crowded and a bit messy-hey, it's Vegas. the service was nice and although the Lavender iced tea was dry and empty-someone from the back grabbed our glasses and hooked us up. \n\nA great stop on Miracle Mile for a reasonable bite-and oh that holiday sammie, more please
