Minus shower facilities this is one of the better United Club\/Presidents Clubs in the system.\n\nThe staff are fantastic, always willing to help with travel, and they really go above and beyond during irregular ops.\n\nThis club even lucked out at one point and they offered bottled water to passengers at the bar, sadly that was a short lived, one time thing.\n\nThere's usually enough seating, the bathrooms are typically clean, and they're good about announcing departures to the hubs.\n\nBiggest plus is the member paid WiFi that doesn't have a restrictive log in like the old United Red Carpet Clubs.
