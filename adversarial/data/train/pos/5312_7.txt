i was having a Fiesta theme get together at my house so i decided to stay away from Frys or Safeway and hit up pro Ranch- such a good decision! it was my first time here and this place is awesome. Huge store with just about everything you can imagine. A lot of specialty things you cannot get at Safeway and places like it but there are also a lot of items you can purchase here that you can get anywhere else as well. Great meat dept. I got 6lbs of carne asada- it was delicious. \n\nThis place is awesome. I got a lot of food for just over $100.00. You can have fun just walking around and checking out everything. You are bound to find something you probably have not tried before and feel intrigued to buy it and give it try. :)
