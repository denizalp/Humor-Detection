I've been a member here since 2012 and I plan on staying. The owners, Chris and Shelly, truly care about the gym and members and always make you feel welcome. The facility always clean and the equipment is maintained. I think my favorite thing about this gym is that everyone puts the equipment back when finished. Love this place!
