I've been in this location a couple of times, and each time it has been a cluttered mess. Today it looked like they were trying to set up some Easter items, but no one was actually setting anything up. Instead it was half empty displays, no price tags...just a huge clusterf**k.\n\nThe regular, non-holiday aisles were an equal mess. Items just thrown down on the shelves, empty hooks, a lot out of place.\n\nI didn't experience the customer service today, but on earlier trips the cashiers have been friendly enough and I was able to find someone on the floor.
