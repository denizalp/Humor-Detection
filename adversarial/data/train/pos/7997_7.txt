My man is not the hugest fan of musical theater but graciously accompanied me to one of the last shows of the Lion King in Las Vegas.  Having grown up on Lion King, the animated movie, it was kind of a childish treat to watch this version. \n\nThe set was simple, letting the characters and the costumes take center stage, no pun intended.  I would have loved to see more props giving the natural elements like flowers, trees, and shrubs more life.  That aside, the costumes were phenomenal.  My favorites were the giraffes and the cheetahs.  It was amazing how the actors brought an animal-like quality to their movements.  \n\nThe show mirrors the movie so there are little to no surprises about plot or songs, which is fine because let's be honest.  Elton John NAILED this.  It was actually astounding and slightly embarrassing how much of the soundtrack I had committed to memory and could recall 20 years later.  I had a great time at the show.  It was visually striking and a feel good activity.  In fact, I still continue to break out in \"I Just Can't Wait To Be King\" unexpectedly from time to time
