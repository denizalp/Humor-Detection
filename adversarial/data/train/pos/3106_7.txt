Best Apple Fritter!!!\n\nWe stopped by on New Year's Day at around 11:00 AM.  I have to admit, I wasn't originally impressed with what Ace Donuts had to offer.  I had a soggy cruller, sampled a less than stellar cronut, the free donut holes were harder than marbles, and my coffee didn't have that \"best part of waking up\" taste. To top it off, the selection was lacking.  \n\nSo why the rave reviews from all the local Yelpers?  Why a 4 star review from me?  It's all about timing, I guess.  I trust some of the Yelpers that have already reviewed this place.  I also assume that they came in with the donuts were hot and fresh.  Again, I arrived at 11:00 AM and was left with whatever Ace had left.  I was very content in giving Ace Donuts 3 stars and that's a solid 3.  But then I tried their apple fritter and my opinion about Ace Donuts immediately changed.  I've had an apple fritter at numerous locations in Las Vegas.  Bar none....Ace Donuts ranks on top. I usually stay away from fritters because they're usually greasy, oily, hard as a rock, and overcooked. At Ace, you get the complete opposite. In my opinion, Ace has the best fritters that I have tried in Las Vegas.  I may not be a fan of everything else that Ace Donuts has to offer, but they get my vote as \"The Best Fritter in Las Vegas\".
