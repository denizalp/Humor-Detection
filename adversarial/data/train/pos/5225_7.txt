Up until dining at Milos, my Greek food experience has been gyros from a truck and\/or sitting in a divey restaurant where ladies with hairy chins serve up greasy plates of spanakopita and crinkle fries. Delicious nonetheless, but certainly not what you get at this upscale Las Vegas eatery. \n\nYes, Milos is fancy. Not pretentious fancy, but they do have linen tablecloths and fancy art on the walls. Because it's Vegas, you don't necessarily have to dress up to dine out here (you see it all!) but I wouldn't want to come in here wearing jorts and a cutoff t-shirt. Just sayin'. This is the type of place where you could show off your hella proper table manners ;)\n\nApparently this spot gets pretty crowded at night, so we came here for a late lunch. It was not busy at all! In fact, we were one of two tables seated in the entire restaurant. I felt kind of bad for our waiter since he was obviously wanting to chat with us, but kept his distance as to avoid being annoying. \n\nThe prix-fixe menu is definitely the way to go. As many have mentioned, it's a good deal for the amount of food you're served. Definitely go with the grilled octopus as your first course - it's quite spectacular. I've always liked this eight-legged food, but have really started to appreciate it over the last few months. I had the shrimp as a main course and it was also delicious. For dessert, it was the yogurt martini. IMHO, Greek food is not synonymous with dessert, but this was about as good as you can get.\n\nWe were in and out within an hour, although we could've stuck around much longer. I would imagine that this would be a place to take business clients or a good friend for a midday meal. Or if you want to call ahead a few weeks in advance, go here for dinner. It's classy, good food and excellent service.
