The service sucks!!!\n\nCalled one night to get a soccer jersey put on hold in a med and lrg, talked to a male employee, and first asked him to see if they had a certain jersey in stock a bayern munich one to be exact. He told me that they had a med and lrg in this jersey, so I asked him to put them on hold for the next day as I would come in and try them on to get the best fitting one. The next day I went in after work to pick it up, and they didn't even get the jersey in, like it wasn't even in stock, the girl who helped me had know idea who the team was, which goes to show the staff doesn't even know the product, that's what happens when you hire kids that don't care. Not shopping in this store ever again, the staff is dumb, and that's being nice!
