Wife found Pappadeaux on Yelp, and boy am I happy she did. We have been watching a lot of Duck Dynasty, and after watching Mrs. K cook up a whole lotta squirrel Brain Jambalaya, my cajun taste buds kicked in. \n\nwe started with the frog legs and lobster egg rolls. The frog legs were incredible, I could not believe how juicy they were. \n\nFor an entre, Tasia got the scallops, and I got the blackened catfish with the dirty rice. I loved this dish, but could barely finish half of it. \n\nWe will be back for sure
