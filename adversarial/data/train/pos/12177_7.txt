2.5 Star\n\nThis used to be Delicious Food Restaurant http:\/\/www.yelp.ca\/biz\/delicious-food-restaurant-richmond-hill that serves quite unique Fukienese dishes. Now after a revamp, redecoration, renaming and it becomes another Southeast Asian Restaurant.\n\nWhen I saw the menu posted outside, I was surprised by their price point with entrees from $10 and up. Even fried noodle and rice dishes are all over $10! I don't mind if the food is worth the price but at least the Singapore Laksa ($9) was disappointing lack of the taste of the rich coconut broth nor that spiciness. The noodle was undercooked and really chewy. \n\nThe owner, staff and cook are all the same from the previous business. They are nice people and I wish them luck.\n\nThe decoration is really nice. The restaurant looks really chic and clean now compare to before. I wish they would have improve on their food too!\n\nBTW,  there is $2 charge person for Chinese tea.
