Tonight I enjoyed my dinner at Vietnam Grille. The wait staff-Kim, An & Johnny are awesome.  The food was incredible. Alex, the owners son is very hospitable and the customers think he is very pleasant.   The chef is Rick, the owner and he always makes sure the food is presented well and at the correct temperature.   \n\nI eat here 6 times a week.   I have a reserved table everytime I come in.  Upon my arrival, Alex greets me at the door.   \n\nI would recommend Vietnam Grille to anyone who is searching for the best Vietnam restaurant in Charlotte. \n\nTry any PHO dish-they are amazing!
