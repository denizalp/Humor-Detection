\"If one is master of one thing and understands one thing well, one has at the same time, insight into and understanding of many things.\" - Van Gogh.\n\nThis quote perfectly summarizes the Keg experience; simplicity at its finest. The Keg brings your mouth through a series of stimulating orgasmic experience which will figuratively, but also literally, make you ejaculate...saliva. \n\nTheir rib-eye steaks are perfectly cooked, sealed and flawlessly charred; complementing its marbling. Their mashed potatoes are perfectly golden, without too much butter and balanced in saltiness. Their appetizers are fair in portion size and great in taste, each appetizer is created to compliment a selection of steak(s). Desserts are fresh and great in portion size, their cakes are to die for. Lastly, The Keg's unique and varied list of cocktails and wines are the perfect final touch to enhanced the already impeccable taste of their steaks.\n\nThe Keg is truly the Piet√† of steakhouses, but unlike marble, their masterpiece of meat will melt in your mouth.\n\n5\/5
