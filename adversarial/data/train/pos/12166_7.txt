This is my MIL's nail place and since her birthday is coming up, I thought a GC to her nail place would be a great gift.  It place is pretty small.  It is tucked in between two other stores, I missed it the first time.  I walked in and was greeted by the lady employee doing a manicure on a customer.  I told her I needed a GC.  She stopped the manicure and helped me.  I noticed the place only had 6 pedicure chairs and 3 to 4 nail stations, but only 2 employees.  I can see why they are slow.
