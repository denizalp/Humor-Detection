Hipster central. While the food is good, I don't think I'm nearly cool enough to ever step foot in this place again. Everyone from the hostesses whispering to each other (who needs 2 hostesses in a restaurant with less than 15 tables anyhow??) to our haughty waitress made me feel judged. I'm willing to admit it's totally a personal problem, but I just felt uneasy and uncomfortable all night. \n\nAs I mentioned, the food was good -- and surprisingly affordable -- but I'm not convinced it's worth the wait and attitude you have to deal with. We had the dirty south nachos (great), shells and cheese (good), brussel sprouts (good) and Korean wings (tasted burnt, below average). I'm not sure I want to dissuade anyone from trying Soul if you're curious but I doubt I'll ever be back. So, by all means, if you want to test your cool quotient, pay them a visit. ;) There's just way too many great, non-hipster restaurants nearby -- Bistro La Bon, Dish, Fern -- for me to give them another chance.
