I seriously cannot understand why any adult would want to live here.\n\n1. The prices are ridiculously high, $700+ for a studio. WHY? That's almost my mortgage payment, invest in property, don't rent. And, if your only option is to rent, don't pay a ridiculous high amount, this is NOT an investment.\n\n2. These apartments remind me of what I would imagine would be a cheap hotel. When you open the door to your apartment, it is not the door to the outside, it's a door to the hall. What if a fire happened, I would be shoving and pushing down the hall to make it to the exit. The smell of the halls, CHEAP! I can't even stand it! The carpet is nasty.\n\n3. NO SLEEP!! This is near the I-17, which means traffic 24\/7!! The windows are not sound proof, and the many times I have attempted to sleep here have been unsuccessful. I've resulted in buying ear plugs, it somewhat helps.\n\n4. PARKING!! It's so tight, not many guest parking options available, and if there are... it's... so... tight...\n\n5. If you have a pet don't even think about moving here, the deposits and pay, NOT worth it. Deposit that's non-refundable of $250, plus an additional $150 deposit, and then on top of that, a monthly fee. SERIOUSLY? Are we in NYC?\n\nI can imagine if you're straight out of high school or in college and love the idea of \"luxury\" but can't afford it so this would be your best bet. It's trendy and hip and you want to show it off to your friends. I can understand that, but for any adult or family, I would NOT recommend these apartments, invest in property instead and don't pay these ridiculous high prices for something trendy, especially in this neighborhood.\n\nGreat marketing from Acclaim tho, I'll give them that! Their marketing team knows exactly WHO and HOW to market to. All this just leaves me wondering who the heck would pay almost $1700 a month for this? Unsolved mystery!
