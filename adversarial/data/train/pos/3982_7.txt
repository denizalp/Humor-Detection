Thank you Ajisen Ramen!  Because of your crappy bowl of noodles I had yesterday, it will make my ramen this weekend at Ippudo NYC (http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz\/ippudo-ny-new-york) taste so much better!\n\nNotes:\n\n1. \"Irasshaimase!\" sounds funny when Chinese people say it.\n2. The creme-coloured broth tastes like salty water\n3. Pretty cheap (but there are way better eating bargains to be had in the Chinatown\/Kensington area)\n4. It's very busy -- I suspect it won't be once they've had enough people try it\n5. Has me rethinking that Kenzo might be a lot better than I give it credit for\n6. Decor is too bright and busy.  Annoying really.\n\nDare I say that you are banned?
