I commend this place for their attempts at making this place a more viable for vegans\/vegetarians.\nThey changed to way they make their pinto beans so it doesn't contain bacon anymore.\nThey've also offered a new type of Sofritas, basically flavored tofu, that you can substitute for your dead animal corpse. \n\nHowever, I always like to brag that it's cheaper for me to get a no-meat burrito with guacamole and not have to pay extra, but with the Sofritas it comes out to extra. Why am I paying the price of meat for tofu that is waaaayyyy cheaper for damn sure? Sorry Sofritas, you're not that damn good.\n\nThe service here is always great, the workers are very nice and work really quick. This place is new and I hope the positive atmosphere stays with this particular location.
