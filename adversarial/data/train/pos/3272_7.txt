Well not sure what to think now, because it seems that my laser hair removal is failing and I am needing to shave my legs every 2 or 3 days now.  I guess I always thought laser hair removal was permanent, no...?\n\nUpdate to the update!  Contour Medical called me and said that I still had an outstanding treatment session that still needed to be redeemed (I had no idea) so they've made an appointment with me in the next couple of days for that and hopefully that resolves this new regrowth problem.  A BIG kudos to them for addressing this so quickly for me!  That is top notch customer service!
