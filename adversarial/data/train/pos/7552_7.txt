Yo, Vegas has a ramen joint. TELL EVERYONE.\n\nMy favorite being tan tan men, I ordered that and the kaarage (small bites of fried chicken). My friend ordered the Fukumimi ramen, which I believe is a pork-based broth.\n\nThe tan tan men was too creamy. Like, grainy creamy. The interaction of miso with the liquid broth was not there. In fact, I barely ate any of mine because of it. Soooo why give this place four stars?\n\nTheir Fukumimi ramen was awesome. It had an amazing flavor that I will most certainly order in the future. I'm having a hard time describing it, just, whatever, just go. Kaarage is good too, but I'd personally stick to the ramen.\n\nSo sayth our Lord and Savior, Flying Spaghetti Monster.\n\nR-aaaamen.
