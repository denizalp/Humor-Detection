My husband and I were grilling with our friends one weekend and wanted to do something we've never done before, which is get beef from a butcher. It's kind of strange that we've never been here seeing as we live down the road and frequently visit Five Guys, Tony's and Duckworth's. \n\nWe walked in, with no idea what we wanted other than steak. I'm not sure if he was having a bad day, and I know it was not the owner who dealt with us, but the guy behind the counter just seemed to be annoyed by us. That we didn't know what we wanted. When we picked something out he said that they were out, and the owner was the one who actually spoke up from the back and said they had something else, that was not only less expensive but more tender. \n\nThe meat was $7.99\/lb so when we tried to order 2 lbs, the other guy said they only sell by the piece. That's fine, but when we told him that we were going to feed 5 people it was like pulling teeth to get him to tell us the average person eats 1\/2 a lb. We decided on 2 pieces which made for around 4 lbs. We had plenty of meat, and it was delicious cooked! When we were walking out we found out that all of the meat is local, grass fed, no fillers or chemicals, just happy animals, too bad nobody told us while we were up to the counter. I just know they can do better, I've talked to others, and read the reviews, so I will chalk it up to a bad day from the one gentleman.
