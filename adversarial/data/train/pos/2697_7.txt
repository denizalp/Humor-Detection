Always busy and always good! Tonight was another great dinner with the family and with it being Saturday we got our sons meal for 99 cents with a purchase of another adult meal. Tonight I really wanted to try something different so I ordered the Cuban sandwich. It was very good and a lot of flavor. The only thing I'd like better was if it was on different bread. It was too thin and toasted too much for me. I would eat it again though. My boys love the hot wings and rarely try anything new, but it's because they always tell me they're the best. My hubby tried one of the burgers and really like it. Bootys is definitely one of our favorites.
