Only after coming in for a free consultation did I find out that not only will they not work with insurance companies, they won't even provide billing codes for your procedure until after the work is already completed. Any company who wants to keep a secret what it is they are going to do until after is not operating in an ethical fashion!!! This can only mean that they overcharge for services and are trying to keep people from being able to compare prices. Other reputable and ethical dentists deserve your business, stay away from crooks like this!!!
