Personal Edge located at the Eaton Centre acts as a repair service for Breville, and sometime after Christmas we took in our brand new and barely used Breville BOV800 XL [ http:\/\/www.breville.ca\/toasting\/the-smart-oven-tm.html ] just for that reason.  Darn you Breville!! But that is another review for another day...\n\nOK, so I'm going to make this short and sweet and not at all painful like our experience was.\n\nI telephoned Breville directly regarding either a repair or replacement for our faulty unit.  Breville redirected me to Personal Edge and informed me to bring the unit there with my receipt and I would receive a new one on the spot.\n\nThis is what happened when we brought the unit to Personal Edge:\n1)  They told us the unit would be repaired and not replaced.  The repair would take about a week or two and they would contact us over the next few day.\n2) MUCH TIME LATER they finally called to say it was being replaced not repaired after all.\n3)  We received a call that a new unit had arrived and we could pick it up.  We did.  It was not in a box... just wrapped in plastic... \n4) We took it home and opened up the plastic wrapping.  It was indeed brand new.  But MISSING the GRILL.\n5) We called Personal Edge.  We played MUCH phone tag.  Finally we were told they would place an order for a new grill, but it was made to sound like OUR FAULT for not having checked before taking it home.\n6) MUCH TIME LATER we received a call saying the grill had arrived and we could come and pick it up.  \n7) We went to pick it up, they had no clue who we were or where to locate the grill, etc. etc. etc. We left MUCH TIME LATER with a grill.\n8)  One month later, I went to clean the toaster oven for the first time and realized that there was no CRUMB TRAY.\n9) Repeat steps 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7.\n\nThe entire process took a total of THREE (3) MONTHS when it should have been resolved on the spot - - by replacing the unit with a brand new one (in a box with all the parts) when it was first taken in to Personal Edge as directed by Breville.
