I had to get a deep cleaning and a couple fillings done. \nDr. Tran consulted me prior when I was pregnant and I decided to return for the job. He and his staff were awesome. He is very careful in what he is doing and makes sure that you will feel no unbearable pain. The office is new and the equipment is great. They have a small camera that they use to take close-up pictures from your teeth inside your mouth. I thought it was neat as you could see in much better detail how good\/bad your tooth is. He is very professional in every sense and worth the extra mile it takes to get to the office.
