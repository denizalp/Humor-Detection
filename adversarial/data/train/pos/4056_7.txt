This is a 4.5 I'm rounding up to a 5. Really big a fan of this place. So much so that I came here for breakfast twice out of 3 days while in town and will definitely stop in on future trips. I was in town for work and found Makers & Finders to be a great start to my day. The atmosphere is clean, open and welcoming. Their food and coffee were on point too.\n\nI had their Chicken Tinga Benny and Arepa Benny, both of which were great. Their salsa verde hollandaise was delicate and flavorful. The rest of their menu sounds great too. I'll have to try their Coconut Tres Leche Waffle next time and since they offer it with the option of adding bacon, that should be a great sweet and savory combo. Their espresso was nice and bold and service across the board was excellent.\n\nDefinitely a go to spot to good food, great coffee, and fantastic service.\n\nP.S. Super easy street parking right in front doesn't hurt either.
