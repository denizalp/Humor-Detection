Disgusting. My food came in a dirty bowl!! Looked as thought it was passed on from about 3 pervious customers that didn't want it!! I was so disgusted and it was just so unappetizing. It's like they don't care about the food that they sent out . Our waitress didn't bother cleaning our table until it was too full for her to place other food. Will never return to this place\nQuality of food is not good , probably a few days old and the place seems dirty and staff does not care
