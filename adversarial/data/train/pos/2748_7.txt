I was in Vegas last week with my favorite sushi buddy, so I turned to my handy-dandy Yelp App to find the best sushi in town. That's how I came across Yama Sushi which has made to order AYCE sushi!!.... \n\nSo we hop in a cab and head over. It is off the strip, but I think that's what made it so great. Yama Sushi is an obvious favorite of the locals and was very reasonably priced. For $23 each, we both got two rolls each, three different appetizers, sashimi,  and ice cream. We were definitely stuffed. \n\nNext time I need a sushi fix in Vegas, I will definitely return to Yama Sushi!! You can't find anything like this on the strip....
