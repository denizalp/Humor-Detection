I will not be giving them my business if I can help it. They sell live lobsters and I HATE them for it. This is total animal abuse and yes, the lobsters do feel the unthinkable and excruciating pain. Sometimes for up to fifteen minutes... I spend tons of money buying gourmet food and they would make a mint off of me if they would stop this. I have inquired many times to no avail. So I will shop at the lovely Woodman's.  If you disagree with them selling live, innocent animals, please call Hy-vee at (608) 244-4696 and tell them. \n\nThe lobsters are not fed (completely starved to keep the tanks clean), oxygen deprived, their claws are shackled and they are tremendously in a weakened and abused state. Then handed to uncaring customers who are going to murder them. I do not want Hy-veevil's phony smiles pretending it is OK. Please do not help them succeed while allowing animal abuse in their store!!!\n\n\nSHAME ON YOU HY-VEE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
