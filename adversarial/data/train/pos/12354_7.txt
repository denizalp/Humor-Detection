The food was so bad. TWe ordered Satay chicken, pork bao, wonton noodle soup, spicy chicken ramen and thai spicy chicken noodle soup. Satay and the bao were ok, edible. The soups were just horrible. I did not know what the heck i ate. They did not taste like how they were supposed to taste. Not even close. And on the menu, it said the soup had bean sprouts, seaweed and stuff...nothing was in the soup, except noodles, soup and meat. Very disappointing.\n\nThe service was also super slow. I had a reservation at 1845. I didn't get seated until 1900. The food didn't come out closer to 2000. I guess they were understaffed. However, all the staff was very nice and they tried very hard to please everybody - the only plus point.
