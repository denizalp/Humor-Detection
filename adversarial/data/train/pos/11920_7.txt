After spending the early afternoon relaxing in the Monte Carlo sports book, I realized I was getting very hungry.  Knowing that my husband wasn't going to leave the sports book for another 3.5 hours until football was over, I ventured into the Food Court.  I stumbled upon Manchu Wok and saw that they offered Egg Drop Soup and I was sold.  It seems like all businesses in the desert like to blast the air conditioning, so a nice hot soup was just what I needed.  I ordered an Egg Drop Soup and a Chicken Egg Roll to split with the hubby in order to tide us over until dinner time.  The soup was gigantic!  It must have been a quart!  Had I known that, I probably wouldn't have ordered the egg roll too.  The soup was good and definitely hit the spot.  I was disappointed though that they don't offer crispy noodles.  I really like putting them into my soup.  The Chicken Egg Roll was good and had a nice flavor to it.  I made sure to grab some duck sauce for the egg roll.\n\nOverall, a decent option when you're looking for a quick bite in Monte Carlo.
