It's that time of year.. the blistering hot days are approaching quickly and my poor A\/C was struggling to do any more than turn on.  \n\nUsing the trusty and painless Yelp app, I sought 5 or 6 quotes, most of whom responded promptly, but none were as thorough and polite as Selma with The Cooling Company. She called me directly and clearly explained the various services they offer, including different membership packages.\n\nBased on my honest and informative communication with Selma, I felt confident choosing their company for a tune up and diagnostic service for my equipment. That confidence was well placed as their technician, Joe, was equally friendly, thorough and competent. The work was performed quickly and the difference in A\/C performance is night and day. He also recommended preventative services and provided quotes for future reference. \n\nI was beyond impressed with the professionalism and service of The Cooling Company; you can tell they value their customers above all else and work around the clock (literally) to ensure their clients are always satisfied.
