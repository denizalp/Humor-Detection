\"I used to be with it, but then they changed what it was, now what I'm with isn't it, and what's it seems weird and scary to me.\"\n\nYa, this perfectly describes how I feel about this mall. Seriously it took me 45 minutes to drive from the entrance by the movie theatre, around The Bay, and to the back to find a parking spot. I think the security guards doing traffic duty cause more problems than they solve, I have found this at other malls that use this method to alleviate parking lot traffic congestion and they had the same result. I'm sure Yorkdale can afford a handful of pay duty police officers that could do a much better job. \n\nIf your shopping with a budget, don't bother coming to this mall. If your shopping for kids, don't bother coming to this mall. If your in to high end fashion with high end price tags, enjoy. Unfortunately this isn't for me anymore. And I don't see why people would bother with that parking cluster f*ck just to get in here, most of the stores are chains that be found at most every mall in North America.
