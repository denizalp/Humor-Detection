A couple weeks ago, my friend Hoang-Khai T. recommended Tao chicken at this location. Being used to eating more or less authentic asian food, I was skeptic about this whole 'general tao' thing, but I trusted him, and went for the MAYO CHICKEN (sorry Khai :') )\n\nThe cashier warned me about its heaviness, but I was starving, so I ordered it anyway. The mayo chicken came battered and fried like general tao chicken, but with a mayonnaise sauce. The batter was rather thin and there was a good amount of chicken in every piece. But the sauce was SUPER SWEET - so sweet a little more sugar would convince me I was eating timbits with a little rice and a little salad. Speaking of salad, I like how they use sesame oil as dressing. Not to mention that the cashier was totally right, the meal was very heavy on the mayonnaise, and it wasn't even as good as the mayo chicken at Keung Kee. \n\nAnother friend tagged along, and ordered the Soo Guy chicken. It wasn't as greasy, but it was sweet. The sauce for this kind of fried chicken was a mix of ketchup and cherry sauce, or at least that's what it tasted. \n\nWe also ordered peanut butter wontons... Wontons were good... the peanut butter sauce was very average. \n\nWhile dining, all the other customers were non asian, and they all ordered a hot tom yum soup, which makes me believe that maybe I deserved a slap in the face for ordering food that I knew I probably wouldn't like (American chinese food is far too sweet for my liking), and I should have went for a soup that ACTUALLY exists in some parts of Asia (Thailand).
