Great little hole in the wall Pho shop a couple of doors down from Chinatown. It's tucked on a side of a industrial \/ retail complex just before the 15 freeway. Their two signature dishes is the Crab Pho and Bun Bo Hue. Both are very good. We also had the pork sausage wrap with was excellent. \n\nPlenty of Parking. Service was OK. All Major credit cards accepted.
