I would give this a zero. I just went to get my hair cut and the stylist I had was terrible. I told her I wanted to get 4 inches off-she told me she didn't want to cut so much and would only take 2. She cut off 6.5 inches (all around, more in certain areas). I now look like I have an extended bowl cut. It is the worst hair cut I have ever had and I would not recommend or go back to this place ever.
