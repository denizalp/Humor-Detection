on our last vegas trip, my friend saw some dude carrying this gigantic novelty guitar filled with alcohol and decided that he HAD to have one.\n\nso a couple of weeks ago, we went to vegas for a concert and he finally got his guitar :] mind you this thing is HUGE! im talking like 80 oz of alcohol! its like the size of a guitar hero guitar! between the two of us, we finished like 2\/3 of it til we finally called it quits! the drink itself was pretty weak, but who are we kidding, my friend just wanted the container.
