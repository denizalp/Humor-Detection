Somebody tried to tell me today that it wasn't Five Guys that Obama visited, but some other greasy spoon way back on that famed day. I almost lost it -- actually, I did lose it. What other juicy burger & delectable fries could send our Commander in Chief over the edge & Gangsta-style, tell off his Secret Service agents so that he could enjoy the fantastic and tasty treats that awaited him? Five Guys, that's who!\n\nStrongsville was the first Five Guys location that I ever visited and I haven't been the same since. Upon getting the super moist patty from heaven into my mouth, I knew this was love. Sure, I've sampled many a burger in my days, but there's just something about Five Guys that makes me say -- well damn, if they didn't get it just right! And the fries? Yes please, though be warned, even a small order is intense. Sure, you might have gut rot afterwards, but if that ain't part of the burger experience, then I dunno what is. \n\nI love this place so much, I might add them to my Christmas Card list. If only Santa would deliver me Five Guys on December 25th. Ahh, we can dream, can't we?
