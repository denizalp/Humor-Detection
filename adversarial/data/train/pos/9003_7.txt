8 of us came here lat night.  We ordered a variety of things--some to share--some selected just for us.  We were first served water and I got an iced tea.  \n\nI ordered the Flock on Flock--a chicken sandwich with a large piece of battered, fried chicken and topped with some chicken salad.  I had it all topped with a fried egg, sunny side up, for some wonderful liquid in the sandwich.  The sandwich is served on sandwich style bread that has been toasted.  It is a large sandwich.  I should have asked for a knife to cut it.  Instead I ate at the edges until I could attack it properly.  Luckily, the yolk stayed with the sandwich and I didn't have any oozing down my beard.\n\nI also tried one of the Thai style deviled eggs.  Quite good as was the order of edamame we shared.\n\nFor dessert, the table got two desserts--a miso chocolate chip cookie topped with vanilla bean ice cream and caramel; also, we got the Kaya toast.  The toast has SE Asian coconut egg jam, brioche, fried egg, and house sweet soy. \n\nService was excellent.  Our water was refilled often and the iced tea was refilled as I got low.  Troy and his mates were good servers.  Chef Su and Jenny Wong greeted us when we arrived and were there to say goodbye.  I couldn't leave without getting a hug from Jenny!\n\nA couple of things to know.  Parking is metered in most areas near Flock and Fowl.  I ended up in the Gold Spike lot and along with others had trouble with our credit cards being accepted by the pay station.  Eventually, I used my Park Mobile app and added the time that way.  It's good because you can see the time you have left and extend it if need be.  The restaurant is long and narrow with plenty of seating.  The entrance is off the main entrance of the Ogden so you need to go there\nto enter Flock and Fowl.\n\nIt is good to see a good restaurant like this in DTLV.
