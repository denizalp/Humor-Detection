I'm sure that my review is going to be tainted, given my lack of insurance and the bill that I just received from services rendered at this hospital...but get real. $3700 for an eight hour visit to the hospital to be treated for severe dehydration?! I looked over the bill and saw that they charged me $922 for all of the lab tests (urine, blood, etc.) and only $105 for the medication they pumped into me, but then I saw the over $2600 charge for just having me go into the emergency room and take up space. I was blown away. I haven't even received my doctor's fees yet, and I'm sure that will be a picnic. Are you kidding me? $3700 to help me keep fluids down?! I was livid when I found this bill in the mail. \n\nThe trip to the hospital was not a very pleasant one. While I understand that you're going to have some sick people in an emergency room, I was completely surround by people throwing up. Everyone had their own personal bucket to vomit in, and the noise was practically unbearable. Instead of publicly puking my innards out, I opted to drag myself to the bathroom. It didn't take me terribly long to get admitted, but once I did get in, it took the doctor almost another hour to come see me. At that time, he only popped in for about two minutes before taking off. He came by a while later to ask if the medication for my nausea was working, which it wasn't. So he switched me to something else. I didn't see him again for another few hours, when he just told me that I could go home when I wanted. The nurses were fairly helpful, but I was never told what was wrong with me until I was able to ask what was going on. I guess my beef with this place is how much they charge for me not even staying the night and requesting that much to be done on me. If they would have just told me I was dehydrated, I would have asked for a prescription and booked it out of there so they couldn't have charged me so much. Yikes.
