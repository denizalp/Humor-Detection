Top-Notch steakhouse in Phoenix. Steak 44 sticks out to me over the Mastros and Ruths Chris of the area. The restaurant is dark, yet cozy and romantic. The servers are polite, a little snobby, but attentive. The steak.... oh man... the steak has rewired my brain to crave it the way addicts crave their drug of choice. \n\nIf you want to impress on a first date, celebrate a special occasion, or you just want to have one of the best steaks you can get in the state ..... Steak 44 will deliver a classy and delicious dining experience. Besides their great bovine meat selections they have incredible Oysters and seafood as well. The fish actually tastes fresh, compared to other places in the Valley at the same price. Desserts are also very well done, and help end a very rich and savory meal.\n\nObviously Steak 44 is a high end establishment, but it is for good reason. It epitomizes the saying \"You get what you pay for\". If you have been brain-washed and only think Mastros is the place to go in the Valley for a fancy steak, you are sadly missing out on a steak and restaurant that will out do them from start t finish.\n\nTIDBIT: The music is very unique... Each time I have gone, the music will vary from Frank Sinatra to Garth Brooks to The Fugees and Michael Jackson. It is not off-putting in the slightest, but something fun to notice. The waiter explained it to us that the extreme variation of artists and songs, is to keep the employees going crazy hearing the same songs day after day.
