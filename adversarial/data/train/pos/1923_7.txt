Since moving from San Diego (quite a long time ago), I have complained that there were no donut places around.  In Southern California, there are awesome, locally owned donut shops in almost every strip mall.  Little did I know that this hidden gem was right under my nose the entire time!\n\nTucked away in the Smith's Grocery shopping center, just a couple of doors down from Johnny Mac's is this wonderful little shop.  The store itself is nothing special.  There are a few tables and it actually looks a little bit run down.  But don't let looks deceive you - this is the real deal!\n\nSupposedly their hours are 4am-10pm, but I've noticed them open at almost all hours of the day.  I stopped in here on a recent Saturday morning after leaving work at 4am.  I was surprised to see at least 5 other customers in there at this time!\n\nThe Lady that helped me was REALLY friendly and thanked me for waiting.  I ordered a dozen donuts, mixed.  I was really happy to see buttermilk bars and blueberry donuts, in addition to the usual suspects (cake donuts, cream filled, jelly filled, etc).  I also added an apple fritter, because they are HUGE and looked really delicious.  Pretty sure that thing could feed a small family!\n\nThe total was $10.75!  That is simply amazing.  If you get a dozen at Dunkin's, you could easily spend $15, without the fritter (which isn't even an option at Dunkin's).\n\nNow, were they GOOD you say?  These are the donuts I remember from growing up.  They are HEAVY.  My Dad commented as soon as he picked one up - \"you could throw this at a burglar and knock them out!\" They obviously use lots of butter and that makes for delicious donuts.\n\nThe blueberry donut was my favorite, along with the buttermilk bar.  They were fresh, not dry and absolutely amazing!\n\nThey come in those old school pink boxes, which is a beautiful sight in my opinion!  This locally owned business is a great, hidden gem in Old Henderson.  It's worth the trip if you want REAL donuts!
