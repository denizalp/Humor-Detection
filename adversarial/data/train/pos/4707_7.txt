Sitting near the Ohio River shoreline in Roberto Clemente park there stands this small roundabout dedicated to the memory of the late Fred Rogers (reviewed separately) who was a PBS TV icon during the late 20th century.\n\nThe Tribute actually stands in the very spot where the north end of the old Manchester bridge stood. In fact if you look across the street towards Heinz field you will see part of the facade of that bridge. The Manchester bridge was torn down years ago with the construction of the Fort Pitt and Fort Duquesne bridges.\n\nA large halfmoon archway surrounds the statue of Fred Rogers and gives you spectacular city views. Inside the archway you can hear a recording of one of Fred Rogers songs. The walkway is elliptical and in the back is not only a plaque dedicating the area but signs and pictures of the late Fred Rogers and Cordelia May who out of her generosity made this attraction possible. Below the front of the Tribute is a walkway that is close to the Ohio River.\n\nThe best time to experience this attraction is when there is no Steeler game going on and you don't have to deal with the crowds. On non game days (both Steelers and Pirates) metered street parking is available or you can take the light rail system over at Heinz field to ride you back into the city.\n\nFor those who are both young and young at heart this attraction is a must for all who cherished the legacy of Fred Rogers and his soft spoken approach to children.
