Fix is exactly what my little corner of W Queen W\/Parkdale needed. \n\nWithout crossing a major street my little family can now get their morning fix. Which for us is often a drip coffee, a green tea and some sort of breaded-breakfasty goodness. The shop itself is beautiful. A bike museum, bike shop and of course, a super-clean and new caf√©.
