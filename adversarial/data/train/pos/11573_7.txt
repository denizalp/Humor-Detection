Oh my goodness! Where have I been? This place is such a little gem and apparently it's been open for three months. I have totally been missing out.\n\nI had heard about this place from a couple people just yesterday so I decided to stop in for a latte. Outside I saw a sign that said pumpkin pie crêpes. So I I quickly switched from just a latte to a latte and a crêpe. Let's start by talking about the menu... they have all types of crêpes sweet and savory depending on your preference. I definitely want to go back to try a savory crêpe. They also have all different types of coffee options and even some tea options.\n\nAs I said before I have the pumpkin pie crave and OMG how amazing it was this crêpe. It literally tasted like I was eating a piece of pumpkin pie and the best part is it has a little crunch to it which I loved. I asked the gentleman who made it for me and he said it was crushed graham crackers and cinnamon. Delicious! Next I had a caramel latte I think they have maybe five different flavors to choose from but I'm a huge caramel fan. I posted a picture of it OMG is it gorge or what? It was super yummy and totally hit the spot.\n\nThe decor in here is so adorable and I love it. Actually a lot of the pieces are for sale which I thought was really neat. I feel like I could spend my entire paycheck here. Lastly the staff is awesome super friendly, hospitable, and took the time to explain to me all the different types of things on the menu and talk to me about the business.  This place is so cool. I love it. I will definitely be spending more time here! Also this must be a friendly hangout spot because the couple that sat at the table next to me was super friendly and talked to me the whole time and then some guys came and sat at my table too. I thought it was very cool I love the vibe.
