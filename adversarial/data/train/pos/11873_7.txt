My blurb to corporate today:\n\nOk.. I am a huge Jimmy Johns fan. I have been since you came to Arizona. I love the quality of the food. The speedy delivery.. the order online option.. everything. Today, while placing my order, a coworker talked about how you advertise speedy delivery, but always come up short. Me, never experiencing such misfortune.. said, \"My delivery has never taken more than 15 minutes.. you must be on crack\". I ordered, and then started my stopwatch 1 minute after clicking the final order button. (I ordered a tuna sandwich with avocado) I was so confident too, because last time, my sandwich came in just over 10 minutes!! So I waited, and waited, and waited, and waited.. Ashamed. I hyped you up sooooo much! 29 minutes and 26 seconds later, your dude shows up!!! That is waaayyy too long. I could have walked across the street to JJ's, ordered, payed, returned and taken a 15 minute nap. I am a busy man JJ's.. A busy, hungry man. Here's the icing on the cake (or lack there of).. you chumps forgot the avocado!!! That was 75 cents! Gone! I am so mad at you. I feel like I just walked in on my wife getting freaky with Dwight Howard. Not cool-
