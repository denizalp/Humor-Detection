Ok so normally I don't do reviews on the typical everyday quick fast stop places like Walmart or CVS, Albertson, Mc Donald's, the Gas Station or \"Burger King\" but since they brought out this Black Halloween Burger I thought you guys might be a little interested in hearing about it. \n\nSo here it is, It's weird! LOL there's nothing wrong with the burger itself it's the typical Whooper and I love me some whooper sometimes very yummy blah blah blah everyone knows how a Whooper taste like but it's got a little bit of a kick with the hint of A1 sauce which is a nicely welcome taste I think not too overwhelming but the bun yet yummy and fun it was just the weirdest thing to bit into a super Black bun and have it play a mind trick in your brain. \n\nAll in all you gotta try it once it's good and you have to experience it for yourself to know what I'm talking about and how triply it is. Have fun an Happy Halloween oh and yes if you've heard the rumor about the after math it's true, not to be gross or anything but it is greener in the other side, Yikes hope that doesn't ruin you appetite.
