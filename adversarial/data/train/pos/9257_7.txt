Staked at this place for a friend's dinner party for 25 or so. I was surprised to see one server for the entire group but somehow with some hiccups he managed to get it done. The server would grab everyone's attention and let us all know that we need to be in our seats so he can take he order. Is this grade school class?!?! Kinda ironic but I guess it works because otherwise his orders would get mixed up when receiving the checks in the end. \n\nI read some of the horrific reviews from prior and major letdowns were the slowness in service but quickness in receiving drinks and salads and appetizers. While ordering if someone asked for a drink that previously didn't get one the server would halt the ordering procession and leave to go get the drink! Thought that was odd yet comical. And, surprisingly our food came out quick but it was only because it was almost 9pm after majority of the customers were done eating. \n\nGnocchi alla vodka: one of the best dishes on the menu or at least of what we tried. House made potato gnocchi with tomato, cream and pink vodka. $13.95\n\nZuppa di Vongole:  clams steamed in white wine, olive oil, garlic sauce. The sauce base was rather tasty. We were definitely missing the crostini (toasted bread) but did soak up the garlic sauce with the starter bread. $9.95\n\nFettuccine con pollo and fungi: normal run of the mill type of pasta dish that can be made at home. Chicken chunks and fungi pieces and creamy high caloric white sauce share amongst three. $13.95. \n\nGetting our checks took years and not sure why. The server would start the same process as he did for taking food orders. So if you started last in food ordering you'd get your check last. Not sure what kind of system they have but definitely not efficient.
