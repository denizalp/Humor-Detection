Kinda disheartens me to write a negative review of this place, but I've gotta be honest.  The Goretorium isn't anything to write home about..especially with the rediculous price they charge.  Perhaps I've been spoiled attending theme park haunted attractions in my youth and presently living in a city where homeless people shouting in your face with oozing sores is the norm, but I wasn't terrified.  I went alone and after three cups of Fat Tuesday, was totally jaded.  I was put in a group with 4 others and was told by the charming Grim Reaper gentleman at the entrance that I was 'totally f****d.\"  Awesome.  Totally ready!  As I walked through, the actors paid particular attention to me...which I LOVED!  I, in turn, screamed in their faces and laughed like a deranged hyena.  Oh yeah...and the blood looks like strawberry jam...mmmm!\n\nI'd go again if it was free or if the experience lasted more than 15 minutes but if I need to look at rubber body parts, I'll stop by my neighborhood Halloween store.  \n\nEli Roth, if you read this, holla!  You need my help.
