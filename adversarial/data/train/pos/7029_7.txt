Popcorn Girl is amazing! They have 50+ flavours and they do not disappoint. My friends and I sampled so many flavours: Dill Pickle, Loaded Baked Potato, Jalapeno Ranch, Pizza, Mac & Cheese, Kettle Corn, Caramel, Sea Salt Caramel, Wacky Watermelon, White Chocolate Pretzel, Strawberry Cheesecake, and Oreo. Thank goodness the employees here are so nice... we made the girl who was helping us go back and forth a few times ^^#\n\nAll the flavours were great (except for Wacky Watermelon, one piece of that was enough for me). The question was whether I could handle eating an entire bag of any of these flavours, and the answer to most of them was no. They were good for trying a sample for the first time, but I wouldn't want to eat more of them. A bag of any size, even the mini, would be too much.\n\nExcept for a select few... The ones that I ended up buying were Loaded Baked Potato (my boss really liked this one), Mac & Cheese (my other coworker and I really liked this one), Kettle Corn (my mum loved this one), and Sea Salt Caramel (gift to a friend, who also loved it).\n\nIn addition to these flavours, my friends also bought Dill Pickle and Pizza, and all of us were very happy with our purchases. And the prices are soooo reasonable! (Another plus: easy parking!) I definitely recommend Popcorn Girl to all popcorn lovers out there :)
