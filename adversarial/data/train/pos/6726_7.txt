Hired this company to help us to get rid of scorpions. While the initial conversations and customer service were nice (while we were deciding whether to sign up with them or someone else), the rest of the experience was a disaster! \nAfter 4 exterminations - both inside and outside the house - scorpions were still here, crawling on bedroom ceiling, sinks and all over the yard. Finally, we hired Preventive Pest Control who explained to us that the poison Progressive had used would not kill scorpions - it only kills their food supply, such as cockroaches, crickets, etc - but the scorpions are left unharmed. Preventive Pest Control got rid of our problem, and we are signed up with them now for regular exterminations. \nHowever, after we called Progressive to cancel the upcoming services, the problems began. They would not pick up the phone during business hours, so I left them a voicemail with all the info regarding cancellation. Weeks later, they are billing us for additional extermination that took place AFTER I placed the call. They are trying to insist that I never called to cancel and explain the lack of communication by \"being understaffed\". They are basically accusing me of lying and being extremely rude on the phone. \nClassic line from the phone conversation with the owner: \"I've been trying to get rid of scorpions in my own house for 10 years, and I still keep seeing them. We never said we would guarantee anything.\" Nice advertising for your won services!\n\nBottom line: horrible service, horrible billing and no help with the pests.
