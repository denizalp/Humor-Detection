I get my haircut here by Ramona.  My old stylist who worked here left 9 months ago and I was assigned Ramona.  She's a great stylist and cuts my hair the way I like it.  \n\nIt's very convenient for me as I workout at the 24 Hour Fitness next door and shop at the Von's in the same shopping center.\n\nI've been very pleased with the customer service here.  I don't have any opinions on the other services they provide because I don't use them.\n\nWill I return?  Absolutely!
