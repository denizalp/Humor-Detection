Ah State Street Brats. I've had many a curd and cocktail at this bar. Each one more delicious than the last. Staff is friendly and efficient and the place (overall) is kept pretty clean considering how busy it gets. Don't expect gourmet eats and drinks at this place, but expect to have a great time with your buds, likely watching Badger sports. \n\nAs mentioned their food is standard 'Sconnie bar fare - burgers, brats, cheese curds, etc. Word to the wise - get the curds. In my humble opinion they serve up some of the best in the area. In terms of drinks, the menu is pretty vast and you can always score a cheap pitcher of Spotted Cow or a Rose Bowl if you're feeling adventurous. \n\nWith two levels, a great patio, plenty of seating and TV's (plus a wooden cow upstairs), Brats is prime for many great Badger games to come.
