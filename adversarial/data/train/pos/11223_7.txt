This review is based on several visits without using any coupon or any discount vouchers (A source of discontent by many yelplers).\n\nA very good, contemporary steakhouse worthy of the Vegas Strip.  Comfortable for a guys steak nite; refined with healthy, pretty menu selections for the ladies.\n\nThe beef tartare is an excellent starter.  The earthiness of the truffle aioli provides a surprisingly different take on the classic.  The foie gras with candied apricots and vanilla gastrique is also a must try.  Vanilla with foie sounds disgusting but it really works, enhancing the full fat flavor of the foie.\n\nSteaks are good but not great.  The restaurant does not make any grading claims on their menu, nor do the serves openly comment on the grade. They are well trimmed and perfectly cooked.  The bone in ribeye and the Kansas city strip are very flavorful but are oddly one dimensional when compared to steaks from the \"elite steakhouses\".  Good beef flavor but missing the \"umame\" profile of good aging.\n\nThe veal chop deserves special mention (don't hate me).  It is surprisingly flavorful tasting more like free range pork than bland veal.\n\nSides are simple and meant to be shared.  The simple wild mushrooms are a perfect match to any steak.\n\nThe wine list is well chosen but not as extensive as other steakhouses.  Prices are in line with Vegas standards.\n\nService is excellent.
