I'm usually a pretty mild and reserved person. If you look at my profile, this will be the first review I've written on Yelp despite being a longtime user.\n\nI ordered from here two hours ago, and I'm still pissed enough to want to share my experience. The last time I was this upset was when I was in grade 2 and this jerk named François stole my only Pokemon card. I never got that card back. Fudge you François and darn you to heck. So why am I upset? Why am I writing this petty review? Its not about the food, so why do I feel the need to relate this to a bad experience I had when I was 7?\n\nI ordered the regular sized jerk chicken meal. After tax and an extra 25¢ fee to use the machine, the price was ~10.50$. Regardless if I'm dining in or taking out, I usually tip on my orders because I worked in retail for 2 years. I know what it's like to deal with annoying customers. For that reason, I am one of the most polite customers a restaurant could ask for. So for about 14$, I got rice, beans, 2 half sized drumsticks and 2 half sized thighs. After I got my stryrofoam takeout container, I realised I needed another pair of plastic utensils because I was sharing with my girlfriend. \n\nSo I ask, very politely, mind you, \"Hey, I'm sorry. Can I have another pair of utensils?\" What does she say? \"not really. it's only one per order\". I was dumbfounded. Are you really not going to give me some extra plastic utensils? I spent 14$. What does a fork cost, 1\/2 a cent? Interesting way to cut on costs. So go ahead and call me annoying suburban soccer mom, but atleast now I know why this place is called the JERK joint.
