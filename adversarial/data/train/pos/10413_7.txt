I'm not sure that I should be reviewing Hudson's, since I don't know how representative my feelings about this place are.  I had a throughly mediocre time here, but if I were to judge from the fact that there was already a lengthy line to get in at 9:30p, and still a line at 1:00a, then I have to admit that this place apparently resonates with a lot of people.\n\nIn any case, Hudson's is currently Calgary's resto-pub hotspot, with a thriving happy hour and an even more thriving night-out scene on weekends (and possibly during the week) .  The food is typical pub fare, the drinks are priced at a small premium, and the crowd is 20-35, 97% white, and 98% drunk.  The dance floor is small, and the music was poorly selected and even more poorly mixed (think bad frat party) on the Friday night that I was there.\n\nIf this were my kind of scene, I might rave about Hudson's.  As it is, though, I find it unimaginative, dull, and an unwanted throwback to my university days.
