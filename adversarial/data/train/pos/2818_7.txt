I have been coming to this exact same DMV since I got my learner's permit at age 15 and I can honestly say, things have 100% improved! In the past, it wasn't uncommon to wait 2 hours to be helped. NOW, there is an INCREDIBLE guy (I wish that I knew his name!) who I've seen the past few times working the lines\/flow and let me tell you, he is SO great for the job. I've been in a lot lately due to selling a car, buying a car, transferring titles, and my name change after our wedding and each time, he has been there with a big smile and SUPER helpful. Not only that, he makes sure that everyone is totally taken care of while somehow managing to keep things moving smoothly! Each time, I haven't waited more than 30 minutes to get what I came for! I also love that they have machines now to renew your registration (they literally print the sticker right there!) so you can literally do it in MINUTES and it has gotten rid of a MAJOR piece of what caused the long lines in the past. \n\nAnywho, i'm impressed with what they've done here and will not be as reluctant to come to the DMV like I was in the old days!
