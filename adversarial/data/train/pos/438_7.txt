I would recommend going to Christies cabaret 2 minutes away instead of this place...but if you insist on going here:  $10 topless dances out on the floor or $20 nude dances elsewhere. Both dances are no contact and they have signs saying \"if you touch, you go\".  Very uptight feel to the club, which made me feel uncomfortable.
