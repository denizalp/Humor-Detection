Even though my sewing machine could not be fixed,  Tom and Chris did everything possible to try and make it right.  They took the time to explain what the problem was and pointed me in the right direction to help me out.\n\nThey gave me a refund for the labor charged, even though they spent time on my machine.  I was very surprised. They are honest and trustworthy.\nI will highly recommend them to my friends and family.\nCindy M.
