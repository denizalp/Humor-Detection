I love this place!!\n\nWhat a refreshing establishment to add to downtown Vegas.  It reminds me of the cute outdoor malls in Southern California (think The Camp for example).  But with a twist since it's made out of containers, and this park has things to playyyyy with!\n\nLegos, slides, foam blocks, Neos, fire-spitting mantis?!  The kid in me just wet my adult pants.\n\nThat mega slide is best done at night.  It'll take you on whips and turns and leave you with a whiplash you'd never expect.  Legos and foam blocks?  Stack them up.. then plow thru them with your fierce moves, since we all know you're the next MMA fighter.  Just make sure the kids don't cry or you'll be dealing with their parents.\n\nNot to mention the array of food and booze!!  All these bars available one after another.. We had some local taps and the lobster grilled cheese at bin 702 and let's just say.. all I heard was ~ahhh~  voices of angels singing.\n\nIn front is a heart structure full of locks, which kinda is a rip off of Paris's Locks of Love Bridge, but ehh.. what else in Vegas isn't a rip off of some iconic spot huh?\n\nDT Container Park is great for modern-day kid (ie.  grown-up kid).  Games, food, booze.  But putting all these bars in such close proximity to a playground?  Now that's the most dangerous game of them all..
