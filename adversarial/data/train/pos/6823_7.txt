I have a 2003 Mustang GT with some issues but none that were a show stopper until yesterday. :^0\n\nThe diagnostics were kinda pricy BUT the cost is applied towards your repair if you decide to go forward with any repairs.\n\nI dropped off my vehicle late Friday about 4:30 and was promised a visual inspection and call back if diagnostics were needed: that did not happen, which concerned me. :^\\\n\nWhen I came in Saturday morning, my car was in the bay being looked at. I had only signed and authorized for a visual inspection but they had done some electrical diagnostics which I don't think they would have charged me for. :^)\n\nI don't know everything about car repair but I can tell most of the time if I am being B.S.ed. \n\nThey recommended about four repairs to fix one problem.\n\nOne repair they recommended I know was needed but I feel weren't necessary. In other words, I have been driving with this condition for some time (three years) and was told by another shop that the repair could be put off for a while but the condition should be repaired soon (that was just two months ago). \n\nDon't get me wrong: it is not like Meineke was doing wrong or even acting in bad faith: it was one shops opinion versus another's (along with my my previous research into the issue) that made me feel that the one repair could be put off for a while.   \n\nIt's hard to believe that the issue had contributed to my cars driveability  but I needed to get it done sooner or later so I opted to get it done that day because the cost was VERY FAIR AND REASONABLE AND I BELIEVED THE SHOP WAS ACTING IN GOOD FAITH.\n\nThey did recommend a spark plug change (as that could have contributed to my issue) but if they had actually checked the plugs, they would have seen that they were fine and recently changed.\n\nI just got the car back and did not check the invoice yet but I will update this review in a few weeks and give more feed back as the car's OBD calibrates.\n\n1\/1\/16 Update:\n\nNo problems with the repair and satisfied with the service: I have not had any more issues with my car so I have not been back which is VERY GOOD!\n\nI would recommend this place to a friend for sure!
