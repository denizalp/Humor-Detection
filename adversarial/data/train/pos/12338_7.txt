I've been waiting for this place to open. Like any other poke place, you get to make your own creation - bowl or burrito - or order something off the menu. \n\nMENU:\nFirst, you decide if you want a bowl or burrito. Options include white rice, brown rice, organic tofu, salad. Next, you choose your fish and mix it with extra toppings like masago and green onions. Then, you choose your toppings. Lastly, sauce is added. When I ordered, I got confused because I was asked about sauce after the second step. I originally assumed that the sauce was the salad dressing (which I always get on the side) but I think the sauce is meant to marinate the fish mixture. Anyways, don't get confused like me. \n\nFOOD: \nI ordered a salad with two scoops of salmon with crab, seaweed, masago, green onions, and creamy jalape√±o sauce on the side. **Side note for the business: you should always ask if the customer wants sesame seeds in their meal. Some people may be allergic and some people may not like the flavor. This concerned me when the person automatically poured in sesame seeds.**\n\nPRICING:\nTwo scoops of protein costs $8.99 and three scoops cost $11.99. Scoops are small in my opinion. Extra toppings like green onion and masago and avocado cost extra, I believe. \n\nQUALITY\/TASTE:\nI wasn't blown away by the way the ingredients tastes. It was just an average poke bowl to me.  \n\nCUSTOMER SERVICE:\nWorkers are friendly but also new to their role. I think they should ask the customer if they've ever been here before and if not, review the ordering process. \n\nOverall, I'll only come back if I'm in the area.
