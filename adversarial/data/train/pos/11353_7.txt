Like all Vegas buffets, this one has it's highs and lows, so for the sake of brevity I'll get to the point.\n\nHighs:\n- Prime rib. This was easily the best buffet prime rib I've ever had, so much so I indulged in a second piece. Extremely tender and very flavorful. Au jus was good too.\n- Warsteiner on tap. Can't go wrong there. \n- Grilled asparagus was definite highlight amongst a collection generally sad looking vegetables. \n- Cappuccino was very good.\n- If you leave without trying the creme brule you have missed out on the best thing there. \n\nLows: \n- Seafood. All of the seafood was sub-par. The crab legs were so skinny they looked like they were harvested from a snow crab labor camp. Oysters were horrible and probably poisonous. Shrimp were rubbery and about the size of plankton. The mussels smelled so bad that my survival instinct kept me from trying them. \n- Sushi. Jesus, where to begin. Let's just say I think I found out where all the expired sushi at Albertsons ends up.\n- Lobster bisque. I know what lobster bisque tastes like. This isn't it. Somehow I imagine giant, white, one gallon cans of ACME Lobster Bisque stacked in back.\n\nAll-in-all we managed to have a good meal and, more importantly, a good time. Trying to guess the cholesterol levels of the, shall we say, more calorically challenged patrons kept us entertained. For the price (87$ for 2) this turkey didn't fly for us and I don't see us coming back anytime in the next millennium.
