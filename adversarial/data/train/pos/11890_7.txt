Fantastic service, delicious food, and wonderful dinner experience. This is quite overdue for a review but I had to share my wonderful experience. They are located in the MGM hotel so parking is easy and convenient whether you choice valet or self parking. The restaurant seems to be set up interesting. There is a sushi bar area, an area for teppanyaki, and an area for regular dining. My girlfriend and I chose to do the teppanyaki. We were sat at a table with just the two of us, I'm not sure if this is normal or maybe because it was quite late in the evening. We both got steak and lobster which also comes with some shrimp, zucchini, garlic, and a couple other veggies. We also got friend rice which was delicious. The whole experience is quite similar to Benihana except a bit more intimate. For dessert there was a plate of three different things to try. Overall a great experience and I would definitely recommend. The reason it lost a star is because it is quite pricey.
