Last night I went to see \"39 Steps\". The show was starting at 7:30pm. We got there at 7pm to get drinks and dessert. I ordered Chocolate Turtle Mousse Pie. When they brought it out to me it was actually 2 very small pies. They were the size of a mason jar lid. The pies looked delicious. When I stated to eat the first the the crust was very hard. I almost needed at least a butter knife to cut it. This sounds very weird but the pie was more soupy than mousse and it had a very peppery taste to it. I didn't eat much of it and I didn't touch the second one at all. \nThe theater itself is smaller, more intimate venue. The play had 4 actors. In this show the 4 actors played about 20 different characters. The actors were very good but the story was hard to follow at times. The stage props were really cool and had multiple uses. The story was infused with comedy which kept us laughing. The party scene was pretty funny with the \"dancers\" in the background. \nThe service is slow. I was glad I paid for my meal with cash so I didn't have to wait to sign a credit card. One nice thing is that they have a full bar. This would be a nice Girls Night Out or date night.
