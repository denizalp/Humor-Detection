Decent spot where there is plenty of free parking. The prices are reasonable for the leather recliner chairs and space per seat. Went on a week day holiday. The staff there are unique. They provide the basic service. The popcorn is salty beyond measure. I understand making it salty so people get a drink, but it's almost inedible. Took the popcorn back to get fresh popcorn but it was just as salty. The place is about as clean as any other theatre you will find. The food station is different. They don't bring your food to you but give you a buzzer to pick it up. There aren't any medal detectors they are very trusting of people just coming in. Overall it's a okay place to go to not my fav so far, but I'll give it a try at another time and different day and see the difference.
