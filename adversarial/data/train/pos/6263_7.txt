I still really love coming to Salon 42 to visit with Erica P. She is so thorough and precise and asks just enough questions to see what it is you are wanting that day. I typically get two different blonde hi lights and a cut, sometimes mixing it up with some red. \nFor my wedding hair last year, she topped my gorgeous blonde mane with a peach glaze that looked perfect in my wedding pictures and even better on the beach on my honeymoon. She even custom dyed a hair piece I wanted to wear on my big day. \nAbove and beyond!\nThis time I got a dip dyed sort of look with a custom reddish pink blend and I love it lots. It was raining and Todd even grabbed an umbrella when I left and walked me to my car so my new locks didn't get all mussed in the rain. :\nGo check them out if you need a new salon and ask for Erica.
