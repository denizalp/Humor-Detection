To start off\n\nI literally go to KungFuTea at least 5 times a week. I've had a taste of all their drinks! All their employees are so nice! (:\nThe service is the best that I've had compared to all the other tea shops that I've been to. \n\n KFT has sort of a hip-bruce lee-alpaca vibe.\n(Props to whoever made that happen!) \nIt's a very clean place with a family friendly environment. \n\nMy favorite drink is the coffee milk tea with herbal jelly. \nAnd the white gourd green tea (which they can make into a milk tea!) \nAnd the oreo milk tea with little sugar.\nAnd probably also the hot green milk tea with nata jelly. \nRecently I've been a big fan of their always creamy taro slush!\n\nThey brew their teas fresh all the time, and their boba is nice and chewy, nothing ever taste artificial or old (like volcano tea, ew.) \nAnd they have this fancy espresso machine that makes the best smells.\n\n\nI would recommend this place to everyone's friends, family, & dogs!\nOn my most recent visit one of the employees (who seemed to be a big fan of singing) had much patience with me and adjusted my drink until it was to my liking! Don't be afraid to ask for adjustments!!\n\nTo finish, \nKFT is the place to satisfy tea-cravings.
