I have no idea how to rate this experience, because it was... an experience? \n\nA brief list of things that you will find at Giligins: \n- a very, very aggressive train ride \n- a very convincing electric chair that makes very convincing noises \n- a pole. \n- a table upon which you can play flip cup. no one will even think about stopping you. \n- plenty of places to hide, should your boss decide to use the restroom and your group decide to hide from him \n- fun??? i think???
