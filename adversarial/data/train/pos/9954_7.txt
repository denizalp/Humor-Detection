This is a fun place! I thought it would be much bigger, but it is literally the narrow space of land between Flamingo and The Quad. It is still spacious enough to squeeze in several, very exciting tenants. Right now, there's a couple really well-known retailers like Ghirardelli, Sprinkles, and Yard House, and New York's very own Brooklyn Bowl. These businesses alone are creating a lot of buzz for The LINQ. That and the monstrous High Roller, which will be the world's largest operating ferris wheel at an impressive 550 feet. Because of the \"open air\" environment, there was a lot of attention to detail on architecture and facades of the stores. The restaurants feature second-story patios and there's a dancing water fountain complete with colorful LED lights.\n\nIt's definitely a wonderful place to hang out, eat, get dessert, bowl, and catch a concert, just to name a few. It has many activities for tourists who don't want to gamble, drink, or club or locals that are looking for something different to do. It'll be very exciting to see what businesses will set up shop in this new lifestyle center. It is a popular model following the mostly successful Town Square and Tivoli Village.\n\nNote: Since there are convenient entrances to\/from Flamingo and The Quad, parking can easily be done at either properties. Also, there is self parking and valet offered for The LINQ, located off Koval Lane (near the High Roller).
