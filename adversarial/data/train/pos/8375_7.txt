Dish was probably one of the best dining experiences I've had since moving to Pittsburgh.  While located in South Side, it's comfortably removed from the chaos of Carson St.  The actual restaurant is a small, dimly-lit European style place in the first floor of a converted row-house.  As soon as you enter, you'll notice a fully stocked and nicely decorated bar area equipped with tables for those unable to make a reservation.  In the back of the restaurant there are 15 or so small tables.  Overall the restaurant is quite cozy and has a very intimate vibe.  \n\nWe started our meal out with the mushroom bruschetta, which consists of three different types of mushrooms served on ciabatta bread.  The appetizer was prepared fresh, brought out relatively promptly and was excellent.  \n\nFor the main meal I had the Rigatonia alla Scarmoza sans prosciutto.  This dish is essentially a rigatoni pasta dish with smoked mozarella, peas and crushed pistachio nuts in a heavenly Parmesan cream sauce.  The pasta was simply out of this world.  My girlfriend had the Grigliata Mista di Pesce which consisted of salmon, calamari and eggplant.  She recommends this for the fish lovers out there.\n\nWe capped our meal off with pumpkin flan: two thumbs up.  All this food with a couple of Peronis to wash it down...probably one of the best meals I've had in a good while.  The service was fantastic and I appreciated their willingness to accommodate us despite being 20 minutes late.  Give yourself extra time to find parking...\n\nLook, this place is pricey and probably isn't somewhere you'd visit often; however, if you are looking to go out for that special occasion, definitely consider it.  You will not be disappointed.  Just be sure to make reservations well in advance; I'd say at least one week or so.
