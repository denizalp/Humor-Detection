If I was ever diagnosed with a sodium deficiency, I'd high-tail it to Canton Chili. I imagine it would only take me a few bites before my levels would be restored. A few more bites I'd be suffering Lot's fate; turning into a pillar of salt from the inside out. I guess what I'm saying is: they serve powerful stuff here. It's Maximum Sodium Glutamate. Frankly speaking, it should only be doled out by medical professionals.\n\nCanton Chili is located near the north end of Chinatown. It's open late, decorated with ever-so-charming plastic tablecloths, and usually quite busy. The service is on par with Chinatown standards; largely indifferent with a soup√ßon of suspicion. I believe there is an aquarium here also, although it could have been a lobster tank.\n\nWe ordered the Hakka Chicken, Crispy Beef and a small portion of rice. The portions here are ENORMOUS so don't try to be some kind of Indo-Sino Cuisine Hero. Two of us barely made a dent in the piles of saucy meat before us, and there were plenty of leftovers. I wasn't too impressed by the Hakka chicken, which was more salty than spicy. The crispy beef was fun to eat but as others have mentioned, this isn't health food they're serving up. It's heavy and pretty greasy. I'll come back when I'm in the mood for a quantity meal, but I'm still on the hunt for solid Hakka in Hogtown.\n\nObligatory Title Pun: This place doesn't quite HAKKA it.\n\nMenu Readability: Features a spiciness scale (out of three chilis), informative pictures and cute misspellings.\n\nNeed to mention: The prices are dynamite. Dinner for two (four really) set us back a little over twenty bucks.\n\nWhat this place teaches me about myself: My tolerance for spice is up there. You needs to bring it!
