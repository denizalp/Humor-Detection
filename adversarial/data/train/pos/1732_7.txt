Disappointing delivery order.  I decided to have my food delivered so that I could watch the Chicago Cubs in the baseball playoffs. \nI went with the Singapore special, spicy curry chicken with onions. To treat myself I ordered an eggroll and also hot and sour soup.\nWhen the delivery came 40 minutes later, I was surprised that the eggroll did NOT have the typical packets of sweet sauce or mustard sauce, the chopsticks that I asked for in my special request were NOT delivered, and the spicy curry chicken with onions was approximately 12 ounces of brown sauce with some chicken parts in it that appeared to have been smashed with a sledgehammer.\nThere was no rice provided and there are no other vegetables in the dish other than approximately six rings of a sliced onion swimming in brown oil.\nThe chicken was skin and fat included. Bones were included as well, although they had carefully smashed each bone so that it was in multiple shards with sharp edges.\nThis may be the quintessential way that Singapore special spicy curry chicken with onions is served.\nSo shame on me if I just was not familiar with the dish. A little rice on the side would have been a nice treat.\nThe hot & sour soup was neither better nor worse than any other hot and sour soup I've had from any other Asian restaurant in Champaign.
