This is one of two \"Elite\" Golds Gym's in the country. What makes it \"elite\" I'm not certain; neither was the front desk rep. However it is pretty unique in design, setup, and equipment selection. I'll run a list for the sake of time (I'm short on it)...\n\nNo pool\n\nNo b-ball court \n\nPlush lounging \n\nCycling studio\n\nCardio Cinema \n\nGroup training studio \n\nFunctional training area (cables\/cross fit)\n\nBoxing studio \n\nPsychedelic lighting \n\nContemporary décor (I'm a softy for cool décor)\n\nSmoothie bar\n\nTowel service \n\nHot sauna & steam room \n\nPrivate restrooms \n\nFrosted glass showers with glass tile interior \n\nOn-site massages \n\nStupendous view\n\nand Christy!
