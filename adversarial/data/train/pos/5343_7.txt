I'm from Chicago & this is my go to spot when I need home food. The last 2x this month I've been there I noticed the service was poor, but tonight sucked. The girl standing outside in the drive thru didn't great me, but stood several feet away yelling what I wanted (what if I had never been there before?).I sat in line for at least 20 mins w\/ a mere 3 cars in front of me. Arriving at the window I asked what my total was & she looked at me like I was stupid. Next window got my food w\/out an apology for the wait. Got home, my food is cold & not a single napkin for a dipped beef! I will not be going here again & this location is giving Chicago a bad name.
