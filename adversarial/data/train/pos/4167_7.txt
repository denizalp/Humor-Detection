Stopped into grab some sundries after doing some shopping in the immediate area.  Pulling into the parking lot one can't help but know they are across the street from the Red Rock and in Summerlin.  Walking inside, I thought I was having an experience reminiscent of those in Hendertucky on the Boulder Hwy.  There was a rather eccentric chap chatting up a rather eccentric chap standing behind the counter.  I tried to remain friendly while maintaing a \"don't $#%& w\/ me\" demeanor.  The establishment is clean and offers pretty much what you need for whatever you need while on the road.
