Ordering online to this location was extremely easy and convenient since you can prepay for your meal and select the time you want it ready. My Arizona burger was made right on time and packaged very well with the modifications I requested (No onions to avoid stinky onion breath at work). The burger itself tasted like your usual Smashburger with great flavor and heat from the raw jalape√±o. Definitely a good place to get lunch!
