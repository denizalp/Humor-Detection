I cannot stress enough how GOOD their cupcakes are. My family and I have searched for 3 years and through many different states to find the perfect cupcake, and finally, we have found one. We have tried EVERY bakery in the pittsburgh area that sells cupcakes. Every single one either had a lack-luster butter cream, which either had way too much butter or tastes gross and artificial, and the cake part was either dry, or dense and spongy. Their cupcakes are absolutely perfect. The cake was light and airy, and moist. The buttercream was absolutely astounding, and it was a great bonus that they really towered that frosting on there. BEST CUPCAKES EVER!
