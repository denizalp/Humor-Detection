Came to Whole foods with hubby the Sunday before Thanksgiving as I'm notoriously the godesss of NON domesticity...aka a lazy slob!  \n\nI did do a semi-review of Whole foods a few months earlier and admittedly it was a bit of an angry rant; \nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.ca\/biz\/the-big-carrot-natural-food-market-toronto#hrid:bovbACyc0M9j3o9VrnBJ6A\n\n I should take it back because on Sunday I was like putty in Whole Foods organically able hands ... I mean you could spend the whole day there marvelling at the hard-to-find or unusual culinary wonders like Ewenity locally produced maple sheep's yogurt or my fave nosh the \"Food Should Taste Good\" sweet potato tortilla chips. The bread and pastries section is seriously my idea of a Red Light District. \n I highly recommend you indulge in the sins of the sour cherry danishes and the mini\/ one serving trifles complete with it's own retractable spork \"me love it longtime!\" \n\n   It certainly helps that the renovations have opened up so much more space, expressly in the brilliant prepared foods section where there is a bar\/station for virtually everything from pizza to olives, sandwiches, the Legendary salad and hot bar and they even have a stir-fry bar!\n\nGetting back to the business of feeding my guests for Thanksgiving, I picked up multiple pre-preped entrees like Turkey with gravy, ham with apple sauce glaze (because hubby is a dastardly pork eater!) ginger mashed potatoes, spring veggie medley and Brussels sprouts, plus an apple pie.  This cornucopia of a meal cost 63 dollars altogether, which is not bad as it generously fed 5 people plus enough for leftovers.\n\n Kudos to the uber friendly hipster-cashier, as he tried to give me my last chance to ditch the brussel sprouts (hubby's choice) and was super gracious that I wasnt feigning the usual Yorkville schtick because I packed my own groceries gasp!  I'm a bit obssessive compulsive about  packing groceries as I fear leaving it to hubby always results in broken eggshells or everything being smothered in nut butter? Cashier-Hipster went on this whole informative spiel about how the Asians are masters of neatness regarding food storage and taught us some Japanese culinary hygiene(?) terms that I have since forgotten.\n Wow an anthropology lesson and yummy groceries cool... very cool indeed Whole Foods!
