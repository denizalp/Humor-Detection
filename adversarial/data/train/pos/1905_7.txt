I'm really not a fan of this buffet restaurant.  Honestly the area the restaurant is located in is not that great.  I was dying to try this golden coral because I had eaten at two other golden corals in 3 different states and they were super awesome.   They were so awesome I had to pinch myself to make sure I hadn't died and gone to heaven.  \n\nThis golden coral I was disappointed in.  Number one it's the type of restaurant where you have to wait for your drinks.  They were crazy busy and it took forever for refills.  I hate it when restaurants understaff.  To me the food was bland.  The only think I really like was the steak.  The salad bar was ok.  It took me several weeks to go because it always looked packed.  Eventually I decided to go with my girlfriend during the busy hours.  Big mistake!  \n\nOther customers there were like packs of animals and when the staff set out new food they would load up their plates until they had to put out a whole new batch.  To me the franchise here in Vegas has just lost some of its flavor.
