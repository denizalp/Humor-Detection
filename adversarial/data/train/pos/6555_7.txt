This is more a review of the cafeteria of the hospital than the hospital itself. I sometimes stop in here to eat lunch (I'm often in the area) and it is hit or miss. Usually the daily special is bomb if it's one of the wraps- actually the wraps usually are a safe bet and they're HUGE!! oh and if you have scrubs wear em- you may or may not reap the benefits :) hahaha- if the wraps dont interest you I would say eat elsewhere, cuz the other food is pretty craptastic for the prices- youre better off at the Carls Jr, or Wendys.
