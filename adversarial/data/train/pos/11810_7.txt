If you're a fan of Joey's, take my suggestion and visit the one at Eatons instead. \n\nThe branch at Markville gives a bad impression of the Joey franchises, and the headquarters should consider looking into the reason why. Although the food and ambience was not bad - I went for desserts one night for the apple pie and the decor was pretty nice, especially the bar - the service almost turned me into Hulk.\n\nNot only did the food take literally forever to arrive, the service was painstakingly slow and the waitresses is in dire need of retraining on etiquette and eye sight. Needless to say NO tips were given at the end of the meal and they should think about why.\n\nWon't be surprised if this place closes down, but really surprised if it continues to stick around any longer.
