I would imagine that if you were to teleport someone from the Marshall Islands to Cleveland, Ohio you would need a steady dose of large-game tranquilizers to numb them from their own shock. Fortunately, the owners of this drinking establishment clearly understand that risk and spirit each drink they serve with enough alcohol to neutralize a 450 pound Samoan on the spot.\n\nBefore I left for Porco, I was a normal guy with a job and a small family.\n\nAs I write this, I'm nine hours removed from a visit to Porco -- which loosely translates in Polynesian to \"crushing your face with a lighted torch of fire water\" -- and I still can't remember any of my children's names or dates of birth. It got fuzzy after a few sips of a drink called the Zombie.  After that, I think I may have wrestled a tarpon fish in the basement of the bar and performed a Polynesian ritual sacrifice on the outdoor porch. \n\nI awoke in my own bed, which scores Porco a solid 5 stars. Don't know where the tribal warrior beads, Palm frowns and spear came from, but I'm sure the goat's blood will come out in the wash.\n\nPorco: you don't need the memories of the last twenty years anyhow.
