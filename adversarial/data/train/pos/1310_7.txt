A new breakfast spot for us! Yessss!\n\nI guess this place is a Hawaiian spot on the islands so I was introduced to this place by a Hawaiian friend. I been here a couple times and each time I got the crab cake Benedict. Bomb! It is fresh, made with so much crab, and it's real crab! I just get half order because that is all I need. \n\nI get their coffee, best coffee out there made just by them. If you like it as well, you can actually buy it from them, can't find it anywhere else. \n\nThe guava pancakes is delicious. But a warning, it is pretty sweet. The actual pancake is so fluffy though. I also got the pistachio pancakes, it isn't as good as the guava, and next time I will try the red velvet pancakes and see if that compares to Babystacks. \n\nMy beau got the prime rib loco moco and that thing is a huge portion! He loved it. He got it with gravy once and the other time he got it with au jus sauce and he liked it way better with the au jus. \n\nI'm not a real breakfast type of person but I do see myself coming back here soon.
