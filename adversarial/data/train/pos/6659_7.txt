It was OK, I guess. Probably will never go back because I don't live in the area.\n\nI felt about 10-15 years too young for the crowd here on a Saturday night (for the record, I'm 29). The band didn't play as many country covers as I would like - seemed more like a random mix of oldies and 80's covers rather than country songs (which I would have preferred). The band stops playing at about 1230am. $5 cover. \n\nThe crowd was mostly Real Housewives of Scottsdale types and their husbands in western regalia. It was a mellow atmosphere with lots of seating, not crowded at all, and some couples dancing. It was too mellow for me though - kinda boring. Perfect place for my parents though.
