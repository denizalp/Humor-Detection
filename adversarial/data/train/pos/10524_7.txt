Where have you been aLL my Life?? \nAfter our super duper Long waLk aLong the strip, hunger finaLLy struck and we just so happened to be waLking into PLanet HoLLywood. The amazing aroma coming out of this pLace is to die for and we didn't hesitate to make a Quick detour. \n\nPin Up Pizza is a teeny tiny shop offering up deLiciousLy GiNORMOUS sLices of pie!!! \nLocated in PLanet HoLLywood, right next to Pink's Hotdogs, this LittLe gem is a Life saver during those Late Late night munchies.\n\nHere's the rundown:\nNo the customer service was not good, in fact, it was pretty bad. They were rushing everyone and they seemed grumpy. That being said, it was Late and super busy so I'm sure they just wanted to get the Line moving.\nPie is 15 inches Long @ $7 a pop. The menu offered during the day seems a Lot more vast than what was being offered at night but that didn't bother me.\n& ALthough this isn't the best pizza I've had, the aroma is neckbreaking good. We were stopped by muLtipLe peopLe about where we bought this from and how they HAD to try it!!! \n\nFYI: if you want an order of wings, you have to order it at the Ringer (bar).
