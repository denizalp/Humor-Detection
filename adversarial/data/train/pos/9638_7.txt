Ok, here I am giving it 5 stars, but this is for their sushi. I'm happy I found this place for a little happy hour dining. I almost always order Japanese Lasagna, and this is the best one I've had anywhere. Also they have a citrus salmon that is really delicious. I've now been here 3 times, and Leo the sushi chef is really a great guy and very talented. I've seen some comments on the menu with the plastic sheets on a clipboard, but is that why you go to a restaurant? Not me, I'm there for the food first, and the atmosphere. I've been pleasantly delighted by both at the sushi bar. Prices even at happy hour are a bit high, usually 2 rolls and a sashimi, with beer, costs me around $25-$30.
