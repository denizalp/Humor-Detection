If you want to eat at a place where there's zero customers u should come here. Everytime I come here there is max 2-3 customers. The food here is okay, VERY LIMITED OPTIONS and they are nothing special. The only thing nice here is their fast wifi (cause no one is using it). They definitely need to expand their menu but overall it has a peaceful environment.\n\n***** they gave us the bill without us requesting for it while we are trying to enjoy our drinks. Like are u trying to kick us out??? ****** 3\/5 to 2\/5
