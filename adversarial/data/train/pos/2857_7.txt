So the boyfriend and I have been busy with moving into our own place in the area and we decided we'll stop by the Aloha Kitchen for dinner.\n\nFirst of all, we're not exactly new to AK.  We always grab lunch at their stand during the Aloha Festival.  With that said, this was our first time actually going into the restaurant.\n\nMy boyfriend got a combination plate of bulgogi and chicken katsu while I had the kalbi [short rib] plate.  For a $19 meal, I wasn't expecting too much --- maybe the same expectation as other Hawaiian eateries this valley is blessed to have.\n\nAnd I was wrong.  The portions are a bit smaller, the meat was a little dryer for the boyfriends plate, and everything was mediocre.  I must say though that my short ribs were delicious!  \n\nOverall, it wasn't that bad but it definitely doesn't taste like their booth at the Aloha Festival!
