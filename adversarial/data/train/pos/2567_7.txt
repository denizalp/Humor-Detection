We were in a rut when friends forgot to book a car service for around town all night for all of us, and the normal service I use was fully booked and didn't have anymore SUV limos, so Presidential saved us from having to take taxis, haha! When I called dispatch they were able to accommodate without any qualms, and the driver was friendly and accommodating the whole night, which is all you can really hope for! We were also upgraded for free, so it was nice to have so much space in the car and not be packed like sardines, haha I highly recommend contacting them if you need limo services around town!
