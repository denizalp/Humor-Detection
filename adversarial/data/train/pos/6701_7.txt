This is a little place in the metro and their pizza is surprisingly good. I had a slice of chicken pizza and was really impressed at how nice the crust was - light, not greasy and wonderfully crisp on the bottom (the good kind of crisp, not that cut-your-gums kind of crisp that a lot of pizza is.)\n\nThe seating area isn't the cleanest - the floor was kind of dirty and it kind of had the feel of a high traffic area, which I guess it is. \n\nThis isn't the kind of place to sit and hang out, but if you're in the area and need a quick, affordable bite to eat (less than $5 for two slices and a drink), it's a great little stop. They have several varieties available if you just want a slice and I think they also do whole pizzas made to order.
