Didn't make it down to the resto when I stayed here last year, hey, who would if you can get it delivered to your room?!?!  \n\nService:\nA bit uppity, like they are doing us a favor by serving us.  I also don't like getting handed off from one server to another without an explanation.  \n\nRestrooms:\nYay for being semi-close!  So many restaurants have facilities in common hallways.\n\nInterior:\nBasic Nobu design.  Nothing special really, chairs and tables are not the most comfy.\n\nFantastic:\n-Yuba New Style Sashimi, wonderful, luscious\n-Field Green Salad, generous portioning and with the ginger soy dressing\n-Uni and Oyster Shooters, loved, fresh and balanced\n-Miso Cod in Butterleaf, off menu, always a favorite\n-Pork Belly Miso, meaty with just the right amount of melt in your mouth fat\n-Yellowtail Belly SASHIMI, wow, best fish of the evening\n-Shaved Ice, SO freaking good, something I will order EVERYTIME, perfect\n\n\nGood:\n-Toro Tartare with Caviar\n-Tacos, didn't like the shell, greasy and thick\n-Inaniwa Pasta with Lobster, good pasta, it's from a package, lobster a TAD underdone\n-Salmon Belly Sashimi\n-Otoro, connective tissue, but still melted\n-Butter mochi dessert, became an afterthought b\/c of the shaved ice\n\nTerrible:\n-House Special Roll, wow SO much rice and it was gummy.  Gross.  \n\nSome really good and memorable items.  You will probably get sticker shock and expect to get hungry later.  Nobu dining is definitely something you pay a premium for. Thank you for opening up this location so I don't have to schlep over to the Hard Rock anymore.  I abhor that place.
