This place is terrible. \n\nPretty much every time that I have stopped by in complete desperation of hunger, I am even more disappointed and ripped off than I ever thought I could possibly be. \n\nLast week after forgetting half of my order (which I didn't realize until getting home (my own fault admittedly)), however, I promptly scoured the bag looking for the receipt so that I could 1) verify that my order was correct (even though I know it was given how much I paid) and 2) get the order number\/phone number to call and let them know their mistake. After no avail I had to get online to find the number -- calling -- no answer. I should have expected this, they don't care about customers here. \n\nThen my wife calls the Wendy's corporate line -- in a surprisingly quick amount of time she talks to an actual human that apologizes for the mistake and says that a \"case is opened\" and the manager from this Lawrenceville location would be getting in contact with us. \n\nYeah, that never happened. \n\nScrew this place. \n\nThis Wendy's has made my wife and I stop going to other Wendy's -- that is sad.
