Wish I could give 0 stars. I recently purchased a used BMW motorcycle from ridenow Chandler.  21 days after purchase and 6 days after the Arizona lemon law expires. The bike caught fire and burnt to the ground. Less then 500 miles on the motorcycle with 0 warning signs, I have been riding over 20 year's and I've never seen anything like it. The bike burnt to rims and frame in minutes. When I finally get a hold of there G.M. Aric Muse after a week of phone calls and emails. He offers no resolution and informs \"his team did everything that he expected them to do in the service of the bike before selling\" . Which leaves me out 100% on a bike that I paid cash for. \n   I recommend never buying from ridenow especially a used bike, and if you use there service department, get some fireproof gear!
