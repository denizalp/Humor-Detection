This store is truly incredible.  I felt like I was walking in to an Old World Hollywood dressing room.  There were soooo many different things in here, all beautifully arranged by color.  The era that the clothes came from varies greatly, so there is sure to be something to suit every vintage fashionista's needs.  My favorite items were mostly coats, some of which were refurbished and adorned by the owner herself, and others were just plain amazing.  I also had my eye on this crazy silver sparkly dress for only 13 bucks!  Unfortunately, my body would definitely protest squeezing into it.  The owner was incredibly friendly and chatty.  This is a fantastic store and I hope to come back and maybe add something to my closet!
