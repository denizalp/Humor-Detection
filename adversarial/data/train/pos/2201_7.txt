I went in with my boyfriend, and it seemed the service was less than friendly.\n\nI had the misfortune of going on a Saturday night, and having to bear witness to the \"entertainment\" of what I assume to be one of the proprietors.  Yikes.  The elderly people seemed to enjoy themselves, but this place just wasn't for me.  The food was by no means terrible, but I found it bland and forgettable; I  wouldn't call it any better than 'average'.
