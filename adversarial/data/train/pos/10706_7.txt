This must be the best chicken fried steak in Las Vegas.  I just can't imagine any better.  The delicious crunchy coating contrasts perfectly with the tender juicy steak inside.  It's a sizable portion;  I was pretty hungry but I wasn't able to finish it.   It's covered with a peppery country gravy made with copious amounts of sausage and bacon.  It comes with toast,  hash browns (or country potatoes) and three eggs.  \n\nCustomer service here is full on five stars. Full on!  Be ready when you walk through the door because you're going to be greeted immediately.  Table service was exemplary!  My waitress immediately ascertained it was my first visit and explained what I needed to know. I've got a thing about toast. I like it almost burnt.  I asked her to make sure it was dark.  She made sure I got it the way I like it.  Five star waitress!\n\nMikey C says: Five Stars! Mr. Mamas is outrageous!
