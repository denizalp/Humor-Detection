Super cool, eclectic, very old diner from the 1940's. I did not like the burger I got but to be fair I knew it was just me and not them. I got the PB Burger which I am guessing is an acquired taste that I have not yet acquired. Ha! So I wiped off the PB and devoured all the ingredients separately for this review. I was pretty happy with the results. All the ingredients were delish. The burger juicy and tasty. For some reason I was nuts about their pickles. lol. I love pickles but these were extra wonderful to me. I also liked their Brussel Sprouts. Super cool and friendly staff too.
