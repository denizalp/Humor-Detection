After having been a customer here,  for over 15 years, tonight was the last time I'm ever setting foot in this establishment. \nI think the restaurant has new owners and management,  and it shows in a really bad way. Gone are all the familiar,  cheery and welcoming staff.  I made an online order at 8pm, was told to pickup at 8.26pm. I arrived just shy of 8.30pm and paid for my order.  My pizza was nowhere to be seen because it wasn't even made. I waited till 8.45pm to  get my pizza.  I requested green peppers on half and obviously it wasn't that way.  The manager accused me of lying and said,  look at your order,  it does not say that anywhere.(in a very accusing and bad tone).  He then says,  I'll make you another one.  I said,  do you think I want to wait for ANOTHER pizza?  He didn't even apologise for not making my first pizza,  then wanted me to wait again.  This place has a terrible manager with no customer service skills and the other staff aren't any better.  A sorry would have sufficed,  my daughter could pick the peppers off but his attitude was terrible. I understand orders can get missed but his handling of the situation was bad.  I'm used to Chinese service that isn't very polite but at least  they're competent.  People here are rude and incompetent.  The food,  by the way,  was fine.
