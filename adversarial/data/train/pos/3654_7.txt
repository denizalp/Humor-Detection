Talk about a local hole inn the wall tucked away secret!\n\nNot only does Booming Spot have some great hot pot for amazingly reasonable prices, they add lemon or lime to their water so it tastes better. I know it's stupid to nit pick at the water they serve but it's this kind of attention to detail that wins me over. Dont know how many times i been to an expensive \"high end\" restaurant to drop some dough just to be served the finest of Las Vegas tap water that's been poorly filtered. \n\nAnyway the hot pots are legit. Only gripe i have is it's not the 'here's a bowl of boiling soup and here's some raw stuff, do your magic and we'll be here to clean up after you when we're finished' setup.
