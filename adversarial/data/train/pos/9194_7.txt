This place has great food and service. It's also huge and has lots of seats. \n\nDo yourself a favor and stop by for lunch one day. They have a large selection of food and even have burgers and cheese steaks if you have someone in the group that would rather have that. \n\nThe meat shawarma was pretty good and reasonably priced. I have not had a bad meal there yet.
