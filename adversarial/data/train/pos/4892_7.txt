Sad to say I like this place more than a mom and pop local store but, I do. \n\nThere's more selection of produce and groceries. Even a deli section for your meats, or should I say \"Asian\" meats -- oxtail, marinated short ribs.\n\nIt's closer to home than Greenland or Seafood City. \n\nPlus there's a \"food court\" in there with all your Filipino goodness ready made food needs.\n\nAlways get the VIP card if you can cuz that stuff adds up in the end! \n,
