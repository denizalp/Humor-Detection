I mistook the restaurant for this unimpressive bakery. I didn't eat at the restaurant so that was a check-in mix up. But this little bakery was right next to the elevator and we wanted a quick breakfast, so we ordered at the counter; Jackie the Turkey and Avocado sandwich and soup. Potato and Mushroom. I had the Tuna with the same soup. Our food was then brought to our table, and I thought it was rather subpar. One of the worse tuna sandwiches I've had in recent memory, with the soup being very bland. I've had better canned soup then this. But at least I requested my bread toasted for my sandwich, Jackie's untoasted bread was literally falling apart on her, and offering me some of it to dip in my soup, it had a taste that was very unsatisfying. Never again!
