The best thing here is the salsa and chips.\n\nI had high hopes for this place, I honestly don't know if it was just me or wtf. I ordered a wet burrito with chicken, no onion, no vegetables, and no salsa. I always point out the vegetables because, I don't like guacamole, I don't like tomatoes, and I don't like cilantro (although it's a herb, pretty much no green on my damn burrito)\n\nService was speedy and staff was friendly yes, but the combinations of enchilada sauce, chicken, frijoles, rice, cheese, and cilantro was not so great. \n\nThe horchata was good too. \n\nOverall I would make sure you are detailed about what not to put in your food.
