This jewelry store does custom designs. I've done a ring before with my friend (at Oakville location), which came out nice. Describing the design we wanted was difficult but consultant was able to figure out the style we wanted. It is time consuming because you have to go back to the studio multiple times to confirm the look. And everything costs money, ie design sketches, consulting, and so on and such. So it is better to get it over with asap even though it may not be what you pictured in your head. Though we think we spent a bit much we are very happy with the rings as we own unique rings that no one else has. \n\nJewelries from random brands are sold at the store too if you just want to walk in and buy them.
