I fell in love with Dutch Bros last year while Spring Breaking in Oregon. I loved the drive-thru concept with really friendly service. \nThe menu is way more fun than the usual coffee chains. \nAnd prices are reasonable! \nI was so excited when I hear that Vegas would be getting a Dutch Bros last year! \nI've been to this location a number of times and always have had a good experience. \nI only wish it was closer to home, as this isn't really in the usual route of stuff I do on a daily or weekly basis. But, when I have the time and want a treat, I trek over and order something like a decaf with soy w choc macadamia syrup, or just a decaf with soy. I love that there are plenty of vegan options for me drink-wise. \nMy daughter likes the Ninja Frost. She was a sbux junkie for years, but since trying Dutch Bros has sworn off sbux and this is now her fave coffee shop as well!  \nThank You Dutch Bros!
