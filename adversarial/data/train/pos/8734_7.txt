Really surprised with the overall average rating. Everything about this place was great. Awesome food and drinks, chill atmosphere and great service.\n\nThis place is the perfect brunch spot. They have a large variety of breakfast casseroles, delicious 7-8in baguette sandwiches, and some great breakfast platters. I had one of their breakfast casseroles (eggs, potatoes, mixed sausages and cheese). OMG, what a fantastic fully balanced dish. It lacked nothing. My boyfriend had one of their breakfast baguettes, complete with lettuce and tomatoes - which at first I found weird. But it gave the sandwich such a refreshing taste. The baguette was huge with crispy exterior and soft interior.\n\nThe mimosas were tasty and had a slightly different OJ but in a very good way. We took a caramel cronut to go and it was THE BOMB DOT COM. Flaky, sweet, tasty - perfection. \n\nService was fantastic. I'll definitely be returning when in town.
