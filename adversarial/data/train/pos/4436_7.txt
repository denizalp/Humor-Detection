First time in a JJ. I asked the guy what he would order... It was the Gargantuan. \n\nI ordered as is no onion. it was ready before i left the register. \n\nIt was huge, good and hit the spot. Enough for two for sure. \n\nThe best part was the staff. The actually were cleaning when no one was ordering. I mean wiping every inch of the place. I appreciated that.
