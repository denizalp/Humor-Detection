I refuse to settle for shitty things.\nI refuse to stay some place miles from the Strip, I refuse to stay in crappy hotels, and I refuse to pay more than $200\/night for such a room.\n\nPart of me didn't think that was possible when I was trying to find a room last week. It was the Monday before Memorial Day, I had five days until I was supposed to check in, and I had yet to book a room. I was resigning myself to the idea of disappointment when I found all of the above at the MGM Signature (thanks to the help of Yelp, of course).\n\nYes, you heard me, I got everything I wanted and more!\n\nThe rooms here can be very affordable if you book your room through VRBO.com. The Signature is actually a condo\/hotel so you can book your rooms through MGM as a hotel (and pay hotel prices) or book your rooms through the owner of the room (and pay ridiculously cheaper prices). How much of a price difference are we talking about here? MGM Signature website, Monday night - $300\/night for a junior suite. Though VRBO - $194\/night for the same room...and that was five days before Memorial Day.\n\n(Quick plug! The guy I booked my room with was amazing. I wrote him an email, got a response within the hour. He made the transaction so easy, no hassle, no problems, and gave me the best price ever. If you want his info, message me. He's seriously amazing.)\n\nNot only are the rooms at the Signature affordable, but they're also gorgeous and big. The Signature is an all suites hotel so you get the king sized bed, a jacuzzi tub, free wireless in the rooms, two bottles of free water a day, flat screen TVs, a DVD player, a kitchen with a stove, microwave and fridge, a TV in the bathroom...you get it. The room's freaking nice. And you get access to their private pools PLUS the usual MGM pools. Seriously, it's great.\n\nNow, to complete the trifecta of awesomeness, the Signature is close to the Strip. It's connected to the MGM hotel, but you can walk to the Strip easily (that is, if you don't mind walking).\n\nThere is a downside to the Signature though - valet is really slow and you can't self park. But other than that, it's seriously one of the best places I've stayed in Vegas!\n\nI think, from now on, the Signature is going to be my hotel of choice when I visit the City of Sin.
