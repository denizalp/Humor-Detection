Me shop at a thrift store.  I think not.  Well, think again.  I did.\n\nI needed to pick up something nouveau riche for a Yelp Elite event this week at Absinthe with a pre-show party at Central.  I went to Savers to look for some outrageous things to wear.  Flashy, bright jacket, frilly shirt, and a great bow tie.  The problem was--they had none of that.\n\nInstead, I ended up with a jacket and shirt (I won't describe it any more than that because I don't want to lose the surprise my fellow Eliters will have when they see me.  Rather than nouveau riche, however, it's more like gaudy, bloody awful!!  \n\nThe store is really well organized as others have mentioned and it was quite clean.  Check out was a bit slow.  It was also an interesting place for people watching.  It was the first time I ever saw a guy who had permanent sideburns--they were tattoed on.  Wow, different doesn't quite describe it!
