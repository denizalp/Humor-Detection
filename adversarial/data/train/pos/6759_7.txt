I found  Allure Body Bar on the internet and set up an appointment this week to lighten my skin in few small areas on my body. My bill came to $266.67.\nThis included a small tube of lightening cream plus a 5 MINUTES RUB on the areas I wanted.\n\n I felt cheated out after I left the so called spa, and wrote a review text when I got home. I received a phone call back in lieu of my complaint shortly after I filed it. \n\nIn my mind I wanted SOME of my money back, not all, to make it fair for all sides involved and was even willing to hear some suggestions of how to solve this problems. A few hours later the person that was on the phone with me, sent me an EMAIL saying there will be NO REFUND!!! there was no explanation and she\/they did not have the courtesy to speak with me directly. I sent them 2 emails since, but never heard from them since.\n\nI now have someone to represent me on this issue. My representative called the spa today, and yet again got no where. The lady at the front desk had told her that she was instructed not to give any information except this email address (marketing@allurebodybar) which in fact, is not an email address at all, and the owner is unknown hiding behind this email above .   She then added that my representative is occupying the phone line and asked her to get off the phone.\n\nThis review is for all people who are potential clients. Please Beware!! Something doesn't add up. My representative will conduct a full investigation into this matter. I will be more than happy to update customers from all walks of life about this situation. \n\nPlease beware!
