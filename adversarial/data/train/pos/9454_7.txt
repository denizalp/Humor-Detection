Wow.  A really really good sandwich in the LEAST place you'd expect it.  NEXT TO A CASINO.  And surprisingly affordable.  Don't think of this place as a budget eat.  Its a really really good sandwich.  But you can save some money by hitting this place up a few times if you don't feel like a full blown buffet meal.\n\nI was told this was going to be an amazing sandwich.  I'm always cautious about my hype before eating at a new place.  But this place delivered and then some.  If you've found this place on yelp mobile and you're trying to decide where to eat.  Just eat here, and thank me later.  You'll only be out $10 if you hate it...
