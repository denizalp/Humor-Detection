It's now 11:18 and the website says this place opens at 11. Sign says open but the door is locked and no one is answering the phone. What BS! I purchased a groupon to try this place out and now I'm outside waiting. There are no hours listed on the door or Windows. So now I'm hungry and upset I wasted my money on a groupon to\nTry this place out. This does not make me want to come back at all. \n\nUpdate:\nI went back on Sunday evening to use my groupon. Went trough the drive through cuz they have no indoor or outdoor seating. We placed our order for chicken fingers. I show the cashier my groupon she takes the number and marks it redeemed. A few minutes after she comes back and tell us they have no more chicken fingers. She did not know how to refund my money or give me a credit or gift card for my groupon. She took down my name and number for the manager to call me. 2 days later not one person has called me! Such lousy mismanagement!!
