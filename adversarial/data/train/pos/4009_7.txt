This place makes me wonder why we overpay to eat at buffets in the first place.  Main objective for a buffet is that you're hungry and want to eat a little bit of a lot of different good tasting foods until you get full and get your money's worth.  But my thoughts tell me that you're not going to fully enjoy your meal if you're eating a lot of different things, where chances are some of the things that you're eating don't taste that great.\n\nAnd I think it's scientifically proven that you're body doesn't tell you that you're full until like 15-30 minutes after you're really full.  If you're looking to go party at night and hit up a club, I suggest coming here at lunch time (before 3PM I believe) and getting a slightly cheaper price, plus you're gonna want to take a nap after spending a good hour to an hour and a half here anyways.\n\nBut this is actually one of the best buffets and if not thee best buffet I've ever grubbed at based on their selection and quality of food.\n\nKudos for their ALASKAN KING CRAB LEGS and cups of warm liquid butter (heart attack in the making), the variety of meat choices (nothing that juicy or great tasting), and their dessert choices (the creamy ice creams were the best), although I do think a lot of their desserts were too rich to actually enjoy the taste of them.  If they had some crawfish here too, I might have to give this buffet 4.5-5 stars.\n\nI did think it was funny that the people sitting next to us had a good laugh with us after looking at our mound of King Crab Leg shells on a plate in the middle of our table.  They were  probably thinking to themselves that we were 6 hungry savages.  Haha!\n\nThey need to add a couple kegs and have a beverage section here.  I'm sure their cleaning staff wouldn't mind cleaning up the crab leg yack left over by a bunch of 21 year olds.\n\nBut overall, I wouldn't pay $40 again to get full unless we were trying to come at the end of lunch time and just chill here for a good 1-2 hours again and have this be our only meal of the day until late night after a night of clubbing, when I can pay 1\/3 the price and still get a quality good tasting meal.
