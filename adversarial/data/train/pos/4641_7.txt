This place serves awesome food.\nA group of us went to savor the flavors on a Friday night at about 8 pm. The place was packed and there were two groups ahead of us. After a short wait we were seated in an adjacent room that felt a little like the family living room as it had great character.\nBecause the restaurant was so busy and it is a small family-run establishment we did not expect to be served quickly. Fortunately we were there to enjoy the company as well as the food so the wait for our food passed quickly.\nWe ordered five separate main dishes that were served in waves. We started with the noodle dish with beef that started our glands    palpitating in expectation of more succulent dishes to come. We then enjoyed a delightful barbecued pork dish and a fish dish with shredded mango (mmmmm).\nThis was followed by another beef dish (loc lac) that was melt-in-your-mouth delicious.\nFinally we had the crepe dish that was a mixture of flavors and fillings. The crepe dish was served last because it required two of the six kitchen burners to prepare and the restaurant wanted the food to reach us in the quickest way.\nWe were all very full by the end of our gastronomic feast. Definitely one of the best meals I have ever eaten.\nWe took at least two hours enjoying our meal. Don't come here if you are in a hurry!
