GREAT annual festival in late September.\n\nJudges are idiots!   There is an \"Artist Walk\" section, and \"other\" section.  I have no idea who the judges are, but they are complete IDIOTS, year after year.\n\nLet me clarify:  This is a \"juried\" art show, as are most decent art shows.  Artists must submit images of their work, and Artist's Statement, booth photos, etc. in order to be juried into the show.  Those whose work is deemed \"worthy\" are invited to exhibit in the Artist's Walk.  Those who don't make the cut are offered the opportunity to exhibit in the \"other\" part of the festival, along with the clowns, balloon artists, sand art, candlemaking, soap makers, etc.\n\nThe judge and jury consistently shun reputable, legitimate and full-time established artists out into the cold, while putting people who string a few beads together or do wire-wrapping in their spare time in the Artist's Walk.  It is mind boggling.\n\nAs an artist, I know of which I speak.  Idiots, I tell ya.\n\nP.S.  And who would put two competing artists of the same medium in booths next door to each other?!?  Sheesh...
