Figured I would try this place as I support all the other businesses in this shopping center.  Save your time and money and go somewhere else. Started out great, then I got my roll. Took one bite and knew something wasn't right. I looked at the salmon and realized it was farm raised vs fresh. Ugh. \nI picked all the salmon out of my roll and continued eating it. Wasn't great.\nNo one ever asked how it was. Everyone saw I picked out the salmon yet no one offered another roll, or even \"is everything ok\" (is know everyone saw bc I'm the only one in here right now) \nWhen the server came to clear my plate I said you use farm.raised salmon? He smiled and said yeah. I said I wish I knew that before.... he took my plate and left the check. \nWon't be back.
