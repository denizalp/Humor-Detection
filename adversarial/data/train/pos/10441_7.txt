Let me preface this by saying I couldn't be happier with this shop in terms of their selection of ejuices. They have an absolutely massive and diverse selection and a vape bar where you can try them all out. \n\nMy gripe with DashVapes is that some of the staff are less than friendly or, at least, they give off that air. The last three times I've been to this store I was neither greeted nor even addressed. Don't get me wrong but I'm one of those guys who likes to feel welcome at the stores I visit. I will continue to come here for cheap ejuices (I highly recommend MtBaker fruit varieties!) but will go elsewhere for transactions involving protracted human contact..
