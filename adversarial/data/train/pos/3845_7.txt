The address is wrong, or they have moved since they were listed - it's now and has been for 2 years in the heart of Yorkville. \n\nWe came here today with a mani and pedi with Fabfind.  After choosing the colours, we sat down for the pedis. The girls were efficient, but I found that even though they were fast, I felt they didn't perform the service long enough - like buffing my feet, and the massage. But it was still okay.  \nI also liked that the polish was applied well and quickly without fuss. \n\nThe mani was the same. She did a good job of getting rid of cuticles and the polish.  The only down side was they didn't have any quick dry sprays, and anticipating this, I brought my own. I think it saved the day, because there were no fans, or dryers, nor did they use quick dry top coats. \n\nI also got a eyebrow waxing. Ada was really good, and always asking my opinion. She also tweezed quite a bit. She was really cute with her handwritten name tag. \nThere was a sign in the room saying to refuse service if you see the her double dip the waxing stick. Not sure why. \n\nThe people who work here are chinese, and they are all really friendly.  They also had quite a few men come in, and male technicians.  \n\nThe owner is really nice. My friend was unable to get her paid for Fabfind, and she help by calling the fabfind customer service to get it straightened out. \n\nThe place itself was okay. It's not decorated fancy, and I wouldn't say that it looked spotless, but it was clean. \n\nPrices were a bit high tho ($25 for mani, $40 for pedi, $15 for eyebrow wax), but average. \nThey also have special deals during the week, check the website.\n\nI'd come back especially if I were in the area.
