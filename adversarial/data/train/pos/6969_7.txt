Back door entrance. Prohibition feel. Interior as far as the walls, are obviously artificial. Overall still provides an enjoyable atmosphere.  \n\nThe best part:  The live band gets an A+++++!  Current music with their own style.  Definitely had me singing along to songs I don't normally like. \n\nThe menu has great options and is affordable. Had some wine by the glass served in a personal carafe.  The truffle Gouda tastes so good. It is served on a platter with bread, apples, dried apricot, and nuts. \n\nDifficult to converse with friends during the band performance. I prefer to sit back snack and absorb the music.
