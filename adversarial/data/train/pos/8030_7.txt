So I'm Here in Pittsburgh for the week and decided to come downtown for a late night snack and drink with some co workers. We were going to some bourbon bar. Next door however... I see this funky dimly lit place playing notorious BIG and outside it says TAKO. Im intrigued instantly just by the music and the word Tako.. (I love tacos. For example if I was on death row and I could have one meal, it would be tacos.) so without hesitation or any permission from my co workers I just signal the \"hey we're going in here first\" face. Pretty packed but we manage a seat at the bar and we are just FLOORED by their tequila selection. \n\nSo this awesome bartender, Caito, makes us all these wonderful tequila based craft cocktails that we just absolutely loved! Then we order chips with a trio of salsas and Mexican corn to start. Both amazing! \nWe were so impressed and I was shocked there wasn't many yelp reviews so I asked Caito how long have they been open and she replies... \"Since Tuesday\" holy balls they just opened and I just happened to find it randomly?! I love random amazing finds!\n\nSO THEN THE TAKOS. We tried just a few; The carnitas, the al pastor, chorizo, and fish. Favorite was carnitas and al pastor. Amazing flavors, well marinated meat cooked to perfection, and fresh made buttery soft tortillas. Chorizo taco was good and had a fried egg which was awesome but it was just a little overwhelming and I wasn't in the mood for breakfast. Fish taco was good could use a little more flavor but I'm also not a big fish fan. \n\nI'm from California and I'm part Mexican and these were some of the best tacos I've ever had and in Pittsburgh. WTF. They were a little expensive but still very tasty. Very good quality and very good flavor. They come in orders of two and the price ranges from about $10-$14. We're probably coming back tonight or tomorrow. I can't wait!
