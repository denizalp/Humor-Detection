I was traveling over the holidays with my family when my car broke down.  I had my ford excursion there and they first charged my 625.00 do diagnose why it would not start.  Then proceeded to tell e it needed a oil pump and it was going to be 3800.00!!!!  I called three other dealerships and they all said the book they use shows that job at 700.00 plus parts... Another 1000.00. So it was1800.00.   Tis place down rot tried to rip,e off and I am sure they do this to others.  I would get your estimate from them then call liberty ford or someone else.  These guys will screw you once they have your car there,  it was worth it to have my car towed from there to another dealer,,,     You have been warned...
