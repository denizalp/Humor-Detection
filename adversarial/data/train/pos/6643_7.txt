Fail! We came in on a slow Sunday afternoon and ordered two sandwiches, chips and drinks. $23 bucks. That's a little high for a glorified Quizno's. Then they only gave us one sandwich. It was another 10 minutes and my partner had to go to the counter and ask where his sandwich was. They still couldn't figure it out. Turns out they made it and it was sitting there. No one called it out. They had NO clue. \n\nAs for the food, meh. Nothing special. The bread is just like any other chain sandwich shop, mushy white bread. Can't anyone make true Italian bread? Save yourself some cold hard cash and go to Jimmy John's.\n\nWe won't be running back here anytime soon. It's too bad I really wanted to like it.
