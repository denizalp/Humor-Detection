I thought the food here was fabulous. From the check in to the dessert I had a positive experience and highly recommend this place.\n\n Located inside the planet Hollywood casino I've always passed by this place but never tried it. I walked up and asked for the wait time which was 50 mins at around 8pm. The hostesses took my phone number and said they would text when the table was ready. Since we were next to the PH mall we did some shopping and gambling to pass the time. We got a text in 30 mins saying the table was almost ready. We took our time getting back to the hostess (10 extra min) and was seated right away. The waiter was very nice and most of the staff were really pretty people. He explained the menu and how to order and his recommendations.  We ordered a salad to start, I got the blue burger and shared some truffle fries. All of the food was amazing especially the French fries! Definitely try it and share it because it was so rich that we couldn't finish. I'll come back for the fries alone! Dessert was the toffee pudding pops which were ok. I also had a Boddingtons English bet which was fantastic. The ambiance, food and service was great and I believe I'll be back the next time I'm in Vegas!
