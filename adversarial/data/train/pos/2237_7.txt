Omg this Target is amazing. I've shopped at many Targets in my life, but this one tops all of them, even my favorite one back home in Vegas. Of course there are some awesome deals to be had; like getting a $10 giftcard when spending $50 worth of baby products. But here is why this Target is top notch. For one, they had a ton of clearance clothing for baby and adults, and it was all organized. The store was clean and the shelves were stocked full of product. ALL the employees were friendly and looked like they loved their jobs. All Target employees need to take note of this location. The employees on the floor asked me if I was doing ok and my cashier was smiling and chipper. There were sooo many registers open, which is a shocker to me because I'm only used to seeing maybe 3 open. I was also shocked to see a huge produce section with everything looking so fresh. And kudos for a Starbucks too!! Wish my Target back home was like this.
