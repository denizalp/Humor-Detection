Why not rename this place Comedy-Fail Sausage-Fest? A friend and I went in to see an open mic. It was lots of white dudes who think they're funny. Nope, they weren't funny. Also, I noticed that EVERY SINGLE one if their \"national\" acts on the calendar are... you guessed it... white dudes. Oh, WAIT: there's one black dude. Hooray, diversity! \/s \n\nYou know, if I want to hear a white guy with an inflated ego blather on about his life, I can sit in any bar in Madison--or anywhere in the world, for that matter-- and hear it (and be bored by it) for free. Incidentally, bar service was totally unprofessional and slow. After reading the flagged reviews, I see that there have been others mistreated by the staff and owner. This place is a joke-- and not the funny kind. Until I see even ONE female comedian on the calendar, this place is dead to me.
