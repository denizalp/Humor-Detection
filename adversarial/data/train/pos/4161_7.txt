I LOVE Sweet Tomatoes!  For the Vegans out there, for which I'm obviously not, or anyone looking for the healthier side of Vegas, this spot has been a go-to for years!  From the moment you walk in the line splits down a seemingly mile long salad bar that has anything you could imagine for a fantastic salad!  From some pre-made varieties, to everything you need to make your dreams come true, to housemade dressings you never thought existed!  Once paid and seated the selection of roughly eight different soups are there for the offering!  My personal favorites here include: mushroom, broccoli and cheddar, clam chowder, and black bean!  Sometimes you just need the healthier options to kinda cleanse your soul!
