Like a few others, I also don't get the hype over Shake Shack considering the west coast has a plethora of restaurants offering delicious burgers at varying price points, flavor, and quality.\n\nI ordered the double hamburger with no bun, as I tend to find the bun takes away from the flavor of a delicious burger. The burger patties were pretty small (see photo) and I requested for extra tomatoes and only received a total of 3 small slices. Their shacksauce wasn't memorable and I ended up excluding it from the burger. Sometimes I think, \"hmm maybe I just didn't order the right thing\", but then I remind myself that if the plain hamburger is lackluster, then they probably shouldn't have it on the menu. The crinkle fries were ordered as well done and were tasty, but I still prefer thin-cut fries (especially shoestring!). I skipped on their shakes as I didn't deem them worth of the extra calories, and my friends didn't either after consuming them.\n\nOverall the employees are friendly and there's plenty of seating indoors as well as on the patio area. The line appears long, but it moves fairly quickly and the actual turnaround time of your meal is less than you'd expect. I'd still prefer In-n-Out in SoCal or SuperDuper Burgers in SF because their sauce is delicious, their fries crispy and flavorful, and the burger meat stands out.
