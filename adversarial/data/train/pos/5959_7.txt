First, the good: it's a very pretty converted old mansion that now serves as a hotel. There's a small bar on the main level of the main house, and the bartender was very good. We also enjoyed the breakfast and the peaceful setting not too close to the city. The bad: we stayed here so we wouldn't have to drive around and could go out to dinner and have some drinks. Our cab never arrived, so we ended up having to drive anyway. They pulled our car around and didn't lock it, which wasn't that concerning given the area but annoying nonetheless. The real complaint: we woke up the next morning covered in ants. They were in the bed, all over the linens and swarming up the walls. We took photos and showed them at the front desk, and they didn't even apologize let alone offer us something for the horror of waking up in a bed full of ants. They said only: \"they spray every month.\" Never again will I stay here despite the otherwise pleasant atmosphere.
