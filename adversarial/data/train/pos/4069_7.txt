Bowling Review: \n\nWe walked in last Friday with a few friends to enjoy some bowling, I was looking forward to this since we had a great time at the Yelp event here a few months back.  \n\n0 stars for Jess Johnson and Geri who were manning the cashier desk in the front of Piedmont. Piedmont has some weird policies regarding their bowling service and these two were very unhelpful and quite frankly, rude. Geri was better than Jess, but dealing with them was a hassle and just put a damper on my experience. We had a big party and wanted two lanes, apparently this was a problem. A few wanted to pay for multiple people but, Jess (with an attitude) kept insisting this was impossible and that separate transactions were needed to pay for each bowler. I'm sorry (not really), but that is messed up..what if you brought your family of 6 and had to pay for all of them... you are telling me that I can not pay for all of them together and must swipe my card 6 times to cover my party.... get out of here. She argued with us for a good amount of time, my friend eventually got sick of hearing her argue and just swiped his card multiple times. \n\n4 stars for everything else. Other than that, we had a great time. The bowling was fun, the servers were friendly. Though was a little irked at the fact that a car bomb was $10 and no drink specials were available, but that wasn't a huge issue. \n\nPiedmont, check the attitudes on your employees manning the cashier desk. Especially Jess Johnson. I understand that Fridays and weekends can get hectic, but there is no excuse for treating a customer as poorly as Jess did.
