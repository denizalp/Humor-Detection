Let's start from the beginning shall we?\n\nAttempt 1 at check in:\n\nMy family's check in time was 3pm. Granted asking to check in at 11am was a long stretch, but please don't try to sell me another room. It'll just make you look bad, save yourself the embarrassment. \n\nBaggage drop off:\n\nI asked the counter if there was a charge for drop off as I scope the city. There was no charge but I was told to tip. Tip is suppose to be voluntarily based on service, telling me to tip is basically charging me... might as well just charge, no?\n\nAttempt 2 at check in:\n\nI booked two rooms due to being in a party of 6. Both were booked under the same name because it was all under one credit card. During the first attempt at check in, I was given a summary of my bookings (2 non-smoking rooms with double beds). So the computers at the hotel were certainly not going haywire. But can the second hotel desk clerk be anymore... what's a better word... um stupid? She gave us one room and I was a bit confused, thus I asked if the two keys were for two rooms. She spewed out a bunch of yes, dismissed me and moved onto other customers. \n\nFine. I was tired, hungry and wanted to shower. I headed to the 24th floor and looked in the room keys' envelope; one room number. Oh fuck my life. I headed back down to the registration desk (mind you, the walk was rather long) and was treated as if it was my fault; maybe 30% since I didn't fight it the first time. Though I specifically asked if the keys were for TWO ROOMS, was I speaking gibberish? \n\nFront desk lady proceeds to be rude and asks if I am sure, blah blah blah. Curses swirls in my head. I had 6 people! I wasn't even allowed to register more than 4 people in one room during booking! I told her I was sure and that there should be enough rooms if I was given two confirmation numbers. Wait for it... I got an eye roll. She's no longer stupid, she's a bitch. Phone calls were made; 10 minutes wasted and I finally got my room. \n\nRoom summary:\n\n-Sink was mucky.\n-Towels were dirty.\n-Towels were not replaced.\n-Nothing was stolen.\n\nAmenities:\n\nThe positive of this hotel is definitely the fact that it is an attraction. Discounts for thrill rides and unlimited access to the Stratosphere tower for hotel guests. Downside to going up was going down (like my pun?). Wait for an elevator is approximately 15 mins, if the elevators you are waiting for malfunctions.\n\nGym is small and limited.\n\nShops are limited and awkward. Though I loved the magic shop because of the friendly greeting I received and puns as I walked around the store. My friend and I spoke with Joe (I think that was his name) for a bit afterwards. Joe is the best and was willing to converse about anything and everything. If I wasn't so tight on time, I would have stayed longer.\n\nCheck out:\n\nSmooth.
