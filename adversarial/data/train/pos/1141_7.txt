Okay, I have not reviewed for quite a while now. Discovery Day Spa deserves the honour of having the best review for being the best Day Spa for the working people. Quick and dirty version is this: Affordable, knowledgeable, and damn good one-hour massage from \"Cookie\". Please pardon my language but all I can say on my way home is \"OH MY GO..SHH, I feel so efffffff-specially good right now. \n\nWhy should you take my review to heart? I have seen a mediocre, okay, good, and better massage therapist. \"Cookie\" is right at the top for me, now, right on par with my regular massage therapist. I cannot cheat on her because she is good too. \"Cookie\" is so knowledgeable about the body, knots, the circulation, and knew the pressure spots on the full body. Cookie imparted the traditional Chinese health knowledge about the body pains I have been feeling. I did not expect to have an incredible experience, as I was just looking to waste  an hour waiting for my other half. Wow! So good! I am so thankful from the minute she greeted me to the very last second when she cracked my neck. I LOVE IT, I LOVE HER. I sound like a stalker; that's how amazing the massage was from Cookie at Discovery Day Spa. As in, I \"feel\" so good from head to toe!!!!!! \n\nI want to tell you all that I learned from her, but I want you to meet her for yourself. I really hope that the next person she meets would feel the same. In any case, I will stand by my review for today's massage therapy. I never tip well. Guess what? I tipped WELL for her! She deserved it. Please never leave, Cookie! Okay?
