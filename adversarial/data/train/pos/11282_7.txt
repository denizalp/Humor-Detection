Two times have I gotten take-out pie from Angelo's, and two times has my mouth been happy with the choice.  As others have commented, their sauce is delicious, and the crust is perfect.\n\nA word to the wise, pizza is \"greasy\" when there is actually cheese and sausage on it.  Both of those items weep juices when heated, so it's not unheard of for a pizza containing those items (not to mention being a deep dish crust, which has oil in it) to be a little on the wet side.  \n\nAnother reviewer commented that they skimp on ingredients...if this is true, why did another comment on the grease?\n\nPerhaps it's the KIND of pizza each ordered?\n\nOn both occasions, the pizzas I have eaten had plenty of toppings that did not dribble off the crust when I picked up a slice.  This, to me, is perfect pizza.\n\nI can't comment on the service, because I've done takeout\/delivery on both occasions.
