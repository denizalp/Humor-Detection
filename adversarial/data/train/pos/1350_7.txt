Food is usually subpar, and I don't think I've ever had prompt service here. I mean, it's a bar, so I don't expect much. But when your first round is finished by the time the waitress brings out the chips and salsa you ordered with it... Well. \n\nSide note: Salty's is a horrible neighbor. So many late night noise complaints from the music (sometimes on weeknights). But who am I kidding, who doesn't love dubstep at midnight on a Thursday?
