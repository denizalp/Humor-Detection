I've been here twice and I've had nothing but great service here from the beginning to the end. The owner is also really nice. Both times my skin was great and felt so soft. I didn't even wear makeup for a few days after each time. I ended up buying a package deal they were offering and couldn't pass it up. It's a good investment plus it makes you feel good about yourself!
