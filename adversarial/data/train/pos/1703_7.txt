I finally decided to order from here last Sun Mar 19th. They always put flyers on my door even though there is a sign saying not to( in 2 languages) and I have called and spoke to a manger on two occasions about this. I ordered through Yelp! The delivery guy shows up I open the door & say hi, he hands me food walks off. He didn't even give me the chance to check my order or to hand him a tip. He never even spoke a word. He was cold and rude \nI ordered 10 piece honey barbecue 5 flat 5 drums ... I got 6 drums 4 flat. I only eat flat so I was agitated by this. The fries and mozzarella sticks were ok but not better than the ones at sonic. \nAfter them posting flyers on my door for 4 years almost every week I expected better for the amount I paid. I will not be ordering from here again and I sure hope you keep your flyers off my door.
