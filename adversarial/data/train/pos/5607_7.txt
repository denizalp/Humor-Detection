Why am I constantly watching good-charismatic-family owned places closing down just for another junk food chain to appear? I feel that lacking healthy options is worst than an insult for the community.\n\nSt. Clair Av. has been in constant trashy transformation. Here are your options to plug your veins, give you a further hearth attack, keep their workers on minimum wage, make you addicted, guilty, and make you think as if you had no choice. I don't consider necessary to write the names of those junk food chains that belong to people who wouldn't consume their own monster creations (enough money for manipulation have they been spending). \n\nWriting about Tantra Lounge gives me strength and empowers me as a woman. The two warriors who attended us reminded me of some determined women I've had the luck to share moments with. Even when their place was semi empty, they treated us like family.\n\nThe food was made at the moment without microwave.\n\nWe were told that they support artists, reason why their walls were full of culture. Being surrounded by itinerant paintings should be a must to visit this place. The ambiance was marvelous as well.\n\nMy advice: start supporting smart businesses because maybe one day you'd be on their quest.
