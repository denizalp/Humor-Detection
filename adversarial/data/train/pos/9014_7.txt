Not bad, but not great.\n\nWe were seated quickly on the patio, which was a good choice considering how loud it was in the inside. And how about the decor inside? It looks like an outdated funeral parlor.\n\nMy wife and I ordered breakfasts: she the blintzes and me the chicken fried steak and gravy biscuits, both had coffee. First off, the coffee is about as good as Folgers can offer. Blech. The food, however, was rather good. We were both happy with our meals.\n\nThe service was OK. Nothing to write home about. Our server probably had multiple tables inside and out, so we didn't see too much of him. He was adequate.\n\nNot sure I would eat here again, but I wasn't disappointed with the meal, just not \"wowed\" on any level.
