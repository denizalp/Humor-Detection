Cookie Monster\n\nIce Cream parlors\/shops (does anyone even use that word anymore) are getting so creative throughout the valley.\n\nI opted for an ice cream sandwich because the fresh baked cookie smell was amazing. These cookies are definitely some of the best cookies I've had in a while and Thrifty's ice cream is a double bonus (took me back to Rite Aid drug store days)!!! \n\nIf your in the area and serious about your cookies like I am check out this Sweet Addiction!!\n\nCookies 1 for $.090 or 3 for $2.50\nGourmet Ice Cream Sandwich $3.69
