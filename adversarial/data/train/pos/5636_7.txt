Awesome location in the middle of the strip! Beautiful decors and fantastic O theater.\n\nThe staff on the other hand is what lost all my stars.\nFrom cocktail waitress, dealers, to buffet hosts, I experienced the rude, cheap, and unprofessional. I did not enjoy the upselling (Fiji water all the time?!), the tip asking (black face dealers), or the cocky cocktail waitresses (uppity bitch).\nI thought it was a rather light crowd for a Sat night but apparently customer service is not a priority in Bellagio?\n\nAs an example, one dealer was bitching to her colleague in front of us for not tipping 10 minutes in a game. Gossip elsewhere please. Ruining the mojo.\n\nWorse were the cocktail waitresses and that one bitch who I wished I got the name of now. Basically I wanted a bottled water but no one came by and asked if I wanted anything for over 1.5 hours! I decided to walk around till I found someone. I saw this waitress with a tray of 3 bottles of water and I asked for one. She quickly replied they were all for someone else without looking at my direction. Then I saw her force the last bottled water onto someone who got a cocktail. His reaction showed that he did not order both but took it anyway. The waitress quickly walked away without bothering to ask if I wanted one.\nI hope you drown in Fiji water whoever you are!
