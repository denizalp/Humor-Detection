Horrible horrible horrible.\n\n- dusty room and old heating system\n- water sink, bath tub clogged\n- other guest room's sinks and toilet clogged led to  somebody calling my room to ask for a permission\n- thin wall - could hear noise from hallway, next door room\nto come in to my room at 9am while I was sleeping\n- front desk doesn't care all sorts of bad experience\n - far away from core $20-25 cab ride one way\n- after next door guest room's clogging situation was repaired, all the dirt came to my bathroom so gross\n\nAlso I paid $170 per night for this motel like rip off hotel - great! \n\nNot recommended
