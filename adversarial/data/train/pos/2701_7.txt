I dropped by this place with my wife and given the 2016 award for ramen on the front door, I expected quite a bit. My wife ordered the original and I ordered the Nishikawa Black. Both of our ramen dishes came out with overcooked eggs (a worrying sign for us).\n\nMy Nishikawa Black came with a piece of Chashu that was cooked decently and tender but not melt in your mouth. I wish it came with more as the piece was not very large at all (given the price tag of the Nishikawa Black at $11.95).\n\nThe broth itself was pretty salty and very spicy. I was not really able to taste the pork broth itself. \n\nI think the most shocking was the noodles themselves were not the typical ramen noodles that you expect, they looked a lot like soba noodles...\n\nOverall, I think I'll have to continue my search for a good Ramen place...
