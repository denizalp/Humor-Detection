This is my new favorite buffet in Vegas! Yes, it's around $35 for dinner ($44 if you come with a large group and added gratuity) and yes, there is a long wait, but it's amaaaaaazing.\n\nThis buffet is more creative than any of the other ones on its level. It seems to cater more toward foodies and people who appreciate well-prepared and innovative food, than to your standard AYCE buffer-goers.\n\nFrom the other reviews, it seems like the menu changes often, too. I was sad they didn't have the mac and cheese buffet, fried chicken, or more types of seafood. \n\nThe buffet offered:\n\n- sushi and made-to-order hand rolls (Sushi was just ok)\n-\"Angry\" Mac and Cheese\n- bone marrow\n- prime rib\n- ceviche (too spicy and everything was chopped up too small)\n- crab legs\n- tomato and corn risotto\n- lasagna\n- truffled scalloped potatoes\n- gnocchi\n- goat cheese and grilled peach bruschetta (among other kinds)\n- lamb ribs\n\nThe dessert section was one of the best I'd ever seen, including gelato (try the Almond Joy or salted caramel peanut!), fudge, chocolate-dipped strawberries with toffee, macarons, fudge, cake pops, and everything else you can think of.\n\nEverything is served in cute sample-size plates, mini pots, or baking dishes. \n\nThe staff was extremely friendly, pulling out our chairs for us and picking up plates for us. I can't wait to go back, probably for brunch.
