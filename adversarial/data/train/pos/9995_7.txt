DO NOT BUY A CAR HERE!!!  Jason the General Manager has 1 heck off an attitude,  We bought a new truck and car on Sat. After paperworked signed everything changed. They slipped in the Butler Guard for $700 didnt tell us and another $199 for IDS.\n\nThey were suppose to call me Mon morning to bring my trade in so come 10 oclock no call I called them no one seemed to know anything about my deal or my Truck and what needed to be done.   \n\nHad to keep taking truck back all week for issues that were not taking care of we were lied to by the salesperson both Scott and Tony. So the truck sat all day Mon nothing done they lied and said they were working on it. Tues they started on it got truck at dusk.\n\nNext day I saw they didnt tint ALL windows like they promised so I had to take it back, they didnt really want to do it but did it was in the deal! they tryed to say I didnt need it. But the fact is they tint all there car and truck! They just didnt want to do it period. And Jason made a smart comment about it!\n\nI noticed a sratch on the driver window on the 4th day each time the vehicle was delivered at night, Then they accussed me of doing it, A Big argument, they called the POLICE, Myself and Char are now banned from all Earnhart dealerships how nice, So what about our extended warranty we paid for, Such nice people They take your Trade stick it to you there then act like they owe you nothing after buying 2 cars and over $60,000 later\n\nDO NOT BUY A CAR HERE!\n\nJason is a complete J--K!
