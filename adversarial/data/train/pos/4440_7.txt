We went to Luciano's  the other day thinking this place was just a chain restaurant and similar to Carrabba's.  We were definitely wrong.  Luckily our curbed expectations led to a very pleasant surprise. (PS - There is nothing wrong Carrabba's)\n\nThe inside of the restaurant is very nice, and feels upscale.  Luckily the prices are not 'upscale' in nature for the food or drinks.  The BIG PLUS here is their SERVICE.  It was exceptional.  Everyone was extremely helpful, friendly, and polite.  The service reminded of something you would see at a very nice steakhouse.\n\nFor drinks, we tried the Strawberry Lemon Drop  and the Pometini.  Both were delicious, especially the Strawberry Lemon Drop.  My only tiny gripe is that they could have been stronger, but they were not watered down.\n\nIn terms of food, we got plenty of their bread, which was warm and delicious, with some kind of olive oil dipping sauce that had a tomato-y taste to it.\n\nFor the entree, we tried their Lasagna Coco Pazzo, which is much different (in a good way) than the traditional Lasagna that you would think of.  Great meat sauce and tons of cheese.  Also, a massive portion, so plan on bringing most of it home, especially if you get after it in the bread department.\n\nFor some reason, we decided to get a dessert, despite the mass quantities of food consumed 10 mins earlier.  We got the Zeppole, which are mini cinnamon sugar donuts with nutella and ricotta cheese in them. Very tasty, but I could have gone for some dipping sauces...because...why not.\n\nWhen we saw this place open up, I thought Carrabba's would have competition, but now we are thinking Sullivan's will have to step their game up to keep us from going to Luciano's for a nice meal.
