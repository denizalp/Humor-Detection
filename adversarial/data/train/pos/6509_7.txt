My first and only visit thus far was many, many moons ago as part of a large meetup group.  Many of us started to gather outside around 7p.  I arrived a little earlier since I planned on trying some BBQ at the stand located outside the venue.  The meat sampler I had was tasty, and it was easier to turn down the cornbread since it looked rather dry.  Instead, I said hello to a beautiful slice of peach cobbler :D  While I cannot eat raw peaches anymore (a pity really, since I only started eating fresh, not canned, peaches around 2 or 3 years ago and LOVE them!), I've found that cooked peaches are safer for me, which I am thankful for.  I recall thinking that the cobbler was good.  \n\nMusicians started to set up around 8, and the first band began playing at 9p.  I enjoyed the many bands that performed that night.  The acoustics of the room was very good considering the venue's history.  I did notice that the crowd here was an amalgam of various age groups, and everyone did seem to be having a lot of fun.  One downside I found was how busy the bar was, esp. since all I wanted was ice water.  Perhaps someone should install a bottled water vending machine.
