I struggle with the quantity of stars to bestow on this place. Maybe 2.5?\n\nI totally get that this is a dive bar. It is understandable that dive bars are suppose to leave residue on you when you leave. However, they shouldn't leave the lasting impression of scariness that this place does. \n\nI was greeted completely without any admirable candor (not that I should expect it). \"What do you want?\" doesn't exactly ring in my ears as an invitation of welcome. I guess I also picked this place when apparently no one comes in. There was one other dude there. He looked like Santa Claus' illegitimate child. So, I would hope a hipper crowd parades around when Trunkspace is rocking. \n\nI suppose my biggest complaints are the lack of welcome that the whole place vibed to me; the inability to judge based on clientele (given what was there, I would guess a village of elves); and the lack of any clean surface in the place. Perhaps I am hasty to judge, but I will sit on my 2.5 until a better experience can raise that. I will presumably be drunk for that to happen.
