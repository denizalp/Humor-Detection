If I were a prisoner on death row, Original Gyro would be my last meal.  The reason I would be on death row is for absolutely murking a criminal amount of gyros from this place.  If it weren't likely to make other guests uncomfortable, I would lay beneath the spinning ring of gyro and have them cut the meat directly into my mouth.
