This is a great YMCA with a positive environment. I am only making this review because I don't want them to slack on their customer service. I brought my son swimming here for the first time because he does not know how to swim. There was a male lifeguard in place who was very vigilant of everyone in the pool. He then switched out with a female. She was doing a great job until a customer came in and started distracting her by holding what appears to be juicy unnecessary girl talk. I watched as the lifeguard kept trying to hold the conversation looking eye to eye with the person and many times away from my son. Without exaggeration this conversation went on for about 13-15 minutes while my son was swimming. I think I am being nice because it seemed longer. I then broke my silence and yelled across the pool and said  to the lifeguard \"Helloooo...that is a gossip session....this here (pointing to the pool) is a life and death situation\".\n\nThe positive: I give this lifeguard a 1000% credit for getting out of bed on a Christmas Eve going to work to do that job. You have to have a big heart to be a lifeguard. I also thank her for not getting an attitude. She seemed like she understood where I was coming from. Furthermore, I sensed that the person she was chatting with was someone she knew and did not want to hurt their feelings. It seemed she just couldn't bring herself to say \"'Hey, no offense but can we chat later?\".\n\nTo the lifeguard, from me to you, let nothing and no one distract you. Have the guts to tell those who want to \"chit chat\" \"I can't chat right now, I am performing my lifeguard duties\". \n\nSincerely, \n\nKim. C\nMasters of Science Occupational Safety and Health
