This is a very nice ice facility! I've been to ice rinks in So Cal as my little bro plays club hockey and none compare to AZ Ice. The grounds are spacious and aren't freezing cold. The entrance area and sides of the rinks are wide allowing for adequate viewing of games while at the same time allowing for people to pass. Parking is ample as is the food situation with Humble Pie just across the lot.
