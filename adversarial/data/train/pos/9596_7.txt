NOT GOING BACK AGAIN!!!\n\nNormally restaurants offer all-u-can-eat using order sheets to order, but The One Sushi uses iPAD to order instead. The thing's it didn't save any time. Even you can just touch on what u want to order, it actually doesn't order automatically. You still need to wait for a waitress to come to your table and put in code to send for you.\n\nThe menu was too international, so it's more like buffet, not sushi all-u-can-eat. Especially when the sushi and sashimi were not good. The sushi rich was so so so sweet, I felt like I was eating sugar, a lot of sugar....And I think the way they cut the sashimi was not how the Japanese did. The hot dishes, basically almost all of them using the same ingredients, but just mixing with different sauces. If they're good I do not mind, but they were not.
