I just want to put a shout out to CBAM, they did my car inspection before I bought my vehicle.  The guys there are fantastic and really warm and know how to communicate car language to us mortals.\n\nBasically I was told the car I was buying was really good for the price and that there was nothing wrong with it except for replacing the tires.  Here I am a year later with no car problems, I have since replaced the tires and have done my usual oil change and point inspection and as predicted have no problems with my little rav 4.  \n\nIt was the smartest buy I have ever made, thanks to CBAM winter driving has been a breeze.
