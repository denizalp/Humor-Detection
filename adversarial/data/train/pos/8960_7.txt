it was good, the food was good service was ok.  It was noisy and the people beside us were loud and kind of ignorant asking why they dont serve halal.  They probably dont serve halal because they dont need your business.   If you want halal go somewhere else, otherwise shut up and let the rest of us enjoy our meal.    I will give it another try and hopefully its not as loud and i have different people sitting beside us.  Bottom line the food was good, the service was laid back, they are in no rush, but at the end of the day you got what you paid for.
