This was a great store I found inside The Grand Canal Shoppes at The Venetian!\n\nIt is very close to Lobster Me....  but upon walking around, I actually found another Welcome to Las Vegas souvenir shop, which looked more like the Las Vegas sign!!!  This shop sells a lot of Hello Kitty stuff, clothes, and more.  There is so much to look at and especially walking around everywhere.\n\n\nHere is a map to help!\n\nhttp:\/\/www.venetian.com\/content\/dam\/lasvegas\/venetian\/master\/main\/home\/hotel\/map.pdf
