Stopped at the Walnut Grill to give their breakfast a try.  I should have taken a few photos to prove that there is truly a place that serves worse food than Applebee's. I have never had lunch or dinner here, and based on my breakfast, I won't be anytime soon.  If you're into snotty eggs, cold fatty bacon, and burnt toast, come on down.  If you're looking for something good, give Eat N Park a go. I do not recommend this place. God, I'm still gagging just writing this review.
