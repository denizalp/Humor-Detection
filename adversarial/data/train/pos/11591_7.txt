This place is awesome- Friendly staff that allows you to try on the condoms before buying.... Amazing toys like Elmo- Lego and Ball Gags. they also have amazing scented oils with a few unconventional favours like smoked fish, curried goat and lavender. I also love the return policy - IF you get home and the condom doesn't fit they will gladly accept them used,  and ensure you are fitted properly! Thanks Condom shack!
