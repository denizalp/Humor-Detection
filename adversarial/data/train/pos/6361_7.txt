I have tried to love this place.  It's close to home so very convenient and they give you a loaner.  The problem is, they have to remember you are in the waiting room in order to figure out you might need a loaner.  The waiting room is \"No Mans Land\" to this place.  Once you go in, the odds are high you may never come out.  I spent 3 hours there one afternnoon.  When I finally got someone to talk to me they said they had to keep it overnight.  I have to wonder how long they would have left me there waiting if I hadn't accidently found a live soul to ask.  In fact, if you see someone wandering aimlessly in that area, you might ask them if they need a ride.  Their hourly fee is exhorbitant resulting in a drain on your bank account that you may feel for months.  There are other Mercedes repair facilities, and dad gum it, I'm gonna find me one!!!
