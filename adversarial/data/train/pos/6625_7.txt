Bar Bily Kun is an OK place, though more for the crowd that regards cigarette smoking as an intellectual pursuit.  If you prefer \"hibiscus beer\" to Molson Ex, you'll like it a lot more than I did.  \n\nI'm giving an extra star for two things that made my visit great.  One, a homeless guy systematically bummed nearly an entire pack of Export As off of an aging long-hair who was, apparently, eager to impress his companion by his spirit of generosity.  The entire transaction took about 11 minutes and raised my hopes that I'd do well in Montreal should beggary ever become my lot.  Second, the waitress was filled with the de Gaullist spirit, and resolutely ignored my butcher French malapropisms.
