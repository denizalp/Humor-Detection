These guys are good.  The Burgh Bites truck guys have opened little restaurant that is more take out then eat in.  Only one long table that seats 12 and a few standing places along one wall.  \nHad the Cuban of a chipotle braised pork should with ham, cheese, truck pickle and a great remoulade.  Wonderful sandwich which came with some signature Torts (flour tortilla chips with some seasoning..also very good.  Also, had a slice of Burgh Bites Slaw that is cabbage with some red and green pepper and some herbs.\nWill definitely be back to try the pizza and some more of the menu!\n\nFacebook page is: bricknmortarpgh
