it's almost been a year since my first visit to hash house. i have to say i've had a change of heart and i actually dig this hot breakfast joint now. \n\nto be honest, i've been back at least 3 times between this location and the new location in the M resort and have left each experience super happy and wanting more. i found a way to combat the massive servings, SHARE! ;)\n\nmy fav dish is simple and delicious. egg white and spinach scramble with country potatoes. \n\nfor the portions one gets, it's really affordable. this is the first change of heart i've had. i'm open to more. =)
