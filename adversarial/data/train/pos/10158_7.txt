This place is an OK little lounge, I've never been here during the day so I cant say much about the food. BUT at night when the lights go out, it's a great place to dance and smoke some hookah. The service is not spectacular- it's difficult lt to get a drink or when you reserve a table it takes forever to get everything set up. The drinks are disappointing too, not at all worth the money you spend on them ($12-$15). You are better off buying a shot to get your buzz going.\n\nThe only thing I llike about this place is the MUSIC. They play mainly hip-hop\/dance\/tech, which is why it's good for gettin yo grove on. PLUS, there are so many beautiful people there, it's definitely a mini club. The crowd however, is YOUNG. Probably suited for the under 25 crowd. None the less still fun. :D Reserving a VIP booth is not bad either, your not going to spend nearly as much as you would at a club since it's a lounge, but still. \n\nAnd crazy enough, the place stays cracking till FOUR IN THE MORNING. So you could probably check out some other spots and then come back for more hella late.
