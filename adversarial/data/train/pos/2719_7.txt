Best.Tacos. Hands down. '\n\nUnless you're in Mexico, you're not going to experience a better taco than here at Tacos El Gordo. We love the Al Pastor - it's perfection on a spit. The entire experience here feels genuine. \n\nIt's typically pretty easy to park, and unless you're in the touristy season, you can usually get in pretty quickly, although there are times when the line is out the door - which is insane. \n\nWe always head straight to the al pastor line and get three (at least) tacos each. They're served on small paper plates, double-corn tortillas, carved from the spit right in front of you. I love to watch the expertise, you can tell these guys have been doing this for a while, and man am I glad! The spice is on point, the sauce is heaven, and the size is perfection. \n\nInexpensive, perfect tacos is what you can expect here, along with Mexian sodas, horchata, and swift service. Yes, there are a ton of people here, but that's because it's incredible. Order more than you think you'll eat - because they disappear quickly from your plate. :)
