Called repeatedly yesterday to place an order around 8 PM. No one answered the phone, and there was no recording to\ncommunicate I was being put on hold. The star is because I liked listening to the thoughtfully curated vintage indie rock their phone line played to me instead of forcing me to listen to endless ringing.  Patronizing hipster \"businesses\" can be such an emotional roller coaster - every oz. of the energy goes to managing their online presence & various other aspects of an overall cooler-than-you image - then when it's time to deliver the service, there's just nothing left, & we're all expected to put up with \"the customer's always a pain in our supercool asses\" attitude.
