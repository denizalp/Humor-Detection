If there were minus stars thats what they would get.  One star is not what I would rate them.\n\nDO NOT DO BUSINESS WITH THIS COMPANY! \nTook my engine to them and $800.  They lost\/sold my engine and refuse to return my $800. 5 weeks later still no money or engine.\nAdrian, put the crack pipe down!  \nI checked the Maricopa County Records\/court records and this company is in the habit of stealing customers auto parts\/money.  Customers have to go to court to get money back.\nLaw enforcement\/Attorney Generals Office is watching\/investigating this company\/employees and anyone that does business with them.  Numerous complaints.\nAny good reviews on any web sites are written by owner's family and friends and employees, not by customers.
