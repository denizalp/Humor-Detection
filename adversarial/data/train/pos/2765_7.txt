Ehhh...\n\nI had just come from signing up at Las Vegas Athletic Club and was ready to get some tanning going. I recently moved from Seattle and was already tired of glowing white in smokey, darkly lit casinos. I saw Bodyheat Tanning within the club, and thought I would check out the salon. Can you imagine the ultimate convenience of getting in your workout and then tanning at a nice salon, all in one building?\n\nSadly, this was not going to happen.\n\nUpon first appearance, it seems like a nice salon. It has 5 levels of beds, including the typical stand-up option, and your orange Mystic spray tan booth. There are several packages and pay options as well. They also feature a decent selection of tanning lotions (all prices way marked up, of course) but then again, what salon doesn't do this? In addition, they feature a wide variety of casual clothing wear - shorts, tanks, basic workout gear, and swimsuits.\n\nI approached the girl at the counter to ask for a tour. She was furiously stuffing a hoagie sandwich into her mouth, with lettuce and gobs of mayonnaise flying everywhere. I was horrified and somehow managed to mumble out \"Sorry to interrupt your lunch?\" wherein she just shook her head, smacked all ten of her inch long acrylic fingernail tips and then said, \"What's up?\"\n\nI like good customer service as much as the next person, but I'm also not there to make friends. So while I found the sandwich massacre to be unprofessional, it wasn't necessarily a deterrent to signing up for tanning.\n\nYet.\n\nI inquired about prices. Their basic package for unlimited tanning in their level 1 bed started at close to $30, which is a little steep in my opinion, since most tanning places offer a $20 package for a basic bed. For use of the 1 & 2 beds, it would run you close to $40 for the month. Ouch. For their \"premium\" package, which is unlimited usage of all beds, $99. And this was only if you are LVAC member, I believe.\n\nNow I'm not an Olympic athlete when it comes to my tanning, so I would never use that premium package. I rely on the occasional upgrade to a higher bed, perhaps once a week or so. At this place, upgrades were outrageously priced and made the $99\/month package look cheap. Jeez.\n\nBut even then, I wasn't ready to walk away. A little pricey? Sure. But it all depends on the quality of the beds. So I asked to see a tour.\n\nShe sighed heavily and asked me to follow her. I was led through a long hallway and was pointed out beds quickly. \"This is a level one. That's a two. Four. Three. One. Five. Five again.\" And so on.\n\nThere's no nice way to put this: The beds looked awful. They were seriously old models that looked beat to crap. The *only* nice beds were the level 5 models, and I couldn't afford the $99\/month pass, nor the ridiculous upgrades.\n\nPlus there was no one in there. Not a single soul. I was there at prime time, as well. That's a sign I'm not the only one that was unimpressed.\n\nSo let's recap.\n\nHigh prices. Terrible beds. Reluctant customer service. Bare facility. Sandwich condiments optional.\n\nThat is enough to give it a one star in my book. However, I give it two stars here, sheerly for the convenience of being located in the LVAC building. Which is really only beneficial to you if you workout at that location.\n\nWhich I do. And it still isn't worth it.
