I had the pleasure of staying here for my birthday wknd and I must say: SIMPLY AMAZING. I'm not going to go into detail about the beautiful chandelier and the funky artsy stuff that you see as you're walking to the Wicked Spoon (the awesome buffet restaurant)... I think all the reviews on here have pretty much covered it all.\n\nI will just say that the Cosmopolitan has THE most amazing bed and pillows. If you don't come to Vegas to sleep at all, then don't waste your time here. I WANTED to sleep the whole time and just order room service so I can lie in on their delicious bed! \n\nThis place also has the secret hole-in-the-wall pizza joint behind STK. Best pizza I've had, aside from NYC, hands down.
