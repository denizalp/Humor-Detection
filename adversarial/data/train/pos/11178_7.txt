Hate to rain on anyone's parade here but the food at best is just average.  Called ahead to reserve table for anniversary party - then emailed to see if we could bring in our own wine.   They responded that we could bring in outside wine for $15 corkage fee which is a little high but we had a special bottle for the occasion so agreed.  We were seated promptly but as soon as the restaurant began to fill up, it was apparent the there were just too many tables in the space.  Felt cramped and little privacy for our conversation.  Split a house salad which was not crisp and fresh.  Lettuce had begun to soften.  Appetizer of calamari and zucchini was very.  Ordered 2 specials and lasagna.  Disappointed with lasagna - absolutely no flavor, dull marinara sauce - the entire dish was just bland.  Chicken special was very good and salmon special with blood orange sauce was also very good.  Our waiter went MIA right after salads were delivered.  Never once checked on our entrees.  \n\nGetting back to the interior ambiance - this space misses it by placing very tall centerpieces so that you can not see the person across from you.  This could be improved greatly by replacing the centerpiece with candles. \n\n Was disappointed after letting management know it was a special occasion that they never recognized it - a small dessert for the anniversary couple would have been a nice touch.\n\nAll in all, this restaurant did not impress me like it has other Yelpers.  Maybe I am just spoiled by Riccio's.  Sorry Rick - we went to the dark side but we are back!  Riccio's rules!
