Really upset that this place has 4 stars.  Very misguiding. Staff was sweet and the place was clean for the most part. \nThe one star is for the food. We ordered cashew chicken and yellow curry with chicken. I'm not sure what we were served but it did not taste like chicken. And ever since my first bite my stomach has not stopped turning. \nWhen the server came by she didn't ask how our food was but asked if we wanted boxes since we hadn't touched our food and the plates were 99% full. After we told her no she just took the plates and brought our check. No questions like \"was everything okay\".  Nothing. \nOn top of that their prices are out of line. $14.95 for curry... which is premade sauce and some vegetables. Really really disappointed in the $30 we wasted here tonight.
