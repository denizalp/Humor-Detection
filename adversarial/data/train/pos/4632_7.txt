My rating is 3.5 stars. I'm rounding up.\n\nAs usual, it takes me a while to get to a brand new, trendy store. Miniso has been open for business at Hillcrest Mall for a while. I finally got to visit it on Labour Day.\n\nIf you love Japanese products, particularly themed items, such as Pink Panther, Moomin, and Line characters, this store is screaming out your name. Prices are pretty reasonable for what you are getting.\n\nI got introduced to Brown, the bear in the Line group of characters, when there was a limited Lamy fountain pen of Brown a few years back. I then when to Shanghai and there was a Line store. I was pleased to see that you can get facial and eye masks branded with these cute characters.\n\nI like Pink Panther. I didn't realize how popular he still is until I walked into this store, and saw purses, phone cases, stuffed toys, and a ton more. Wow!\n\nThe plush, stuffed toys in this store are pretty extensive. Keep on walking towards the back of the store and see the large selection. They are adorable!\n\nAs a person who enjoys looking at electronic accessories, the variety is impressive. I loved looking at these heavy duty Moomin power banks for your cell phones, tablets, and more. They are heavier in weight than any of the power banks that I own, but they are cute, functional, and mightier in charge.\n\nI did not buy anything. My goal was to browse and then figure out what I'd like. From purse accessories to stationery, I can see myself doing a ton of damage.\n\nI like that Hillcrest is bringing exciting stores into its mall. Miniso is a perfect addition to the store roster.\n\n(336)
