Favorite coffee spot while my stay at the Venetian Hotel! I got my coffee here almost every morning. I was quite surprised that the sizes here a bigger than what I'm used to but I'm not complaining about more fuel! Coffee here is not cheap but quality is great for what you pay for! \n\nMy hubby and I pretty much tried all the iced coffees and cold brews. Our favorite had to the Iced Hazelnut Coffee. I love the strong flavor presence of the hazelnut. Coffee is bold as well. \n\nI love it!
