I'm really trying to just grin and bear it as I gradually perceive that the equipment isn't being refreshed and the locker rooms\/showers just aren't getting cleaned. I'm on the verge of giving up. Going there--no matter how convenient--is becoming a chore. \n\nThey need to steam-clean the showers and bathrooms regularly. The place isn't open 24\/7 so it shouldn't be a big deal. Most of the carpet also needs to be replaced following the pool leak. The musty smells are getting to be too much.
