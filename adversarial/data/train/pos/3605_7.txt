Now this is a nice place with a great concept.  Good drinks, food and plenty of board games.  The staff is knowledgable and if one doesn't know they find one who is to answer any of your questions.   The chairs and tables are set up to give you plenty of space while sill maiming close proximity to other people.  I had a great time, great date place as well.....that is if she isn't a sore loser ;). Luckily mine was terrific! \n\nWill repeat here for sure!
