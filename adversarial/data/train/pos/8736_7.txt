We came to Vegas with family, including 4 kids under 16. Needless to say, we needed some activities other than the usual drinking, clubbing, eating, and gambling. Enter Siegfried and Roy's Secret Garden. The kids absolutely loved it. The adults weren't bored out of their minds, but they weren't quite as entertained as the kids. Admission price is a little steep, especially considering we only stayed about an hour. $22 for adults and $17 for kids under 12. \n\nYou first walk in to a dolphin pool and underground dolphin aquarium. There isn't a dolphin show exactly, but you can watch the training sessions. The dolphins are so adorable and the kids really loved just watching them swim around. \n\nNext up is the jungle habitat. You get your picture taken on a green screen and then can buy a souvenir photo with different Vegas and jungle backgrounds. $20-something for one, $45 for two and get one free. There are several tigers, a lion, and a cheetah in the habitats. No shows here, it's more like a mini zoo. The kids went crazy over this! We also saw Siegfried just walking around which was kind of cool.\n\nPersonally, I hated it. I felt really bad for the tigers and lion being stuck in those mini habitats; they looked so sad. I wish they could be free to roam as nature intended and be the king of jungle, but that's the issue I have with zoos in general. There's quite a bit of literature about Siegfried and Roy's conservation efforts, so I doubt they mistreat the animals. Not going to dock stars for my own personal misgivings. \n\nOverall, very kid friendly and big hit with kids of all ages!
