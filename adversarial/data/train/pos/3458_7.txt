Furniture is nice to look at, but pricey.  Not too sure about the quality as only time will tell.  I've never purchased something from here.\n\nAnyway, I had a very unpleasant encounter here with one of their sales associates, a blond lady in her 40-50s.  I was sitting on a chair and she approached me and told me that I was sitting on a recliner.  Fine.\n\nInstead of being a decent, helpful person, she watched as I struggled to figure out how to kick up the footrest.  Finally, she condescendingly told me that the lever was on the inside of the side of the chair.  Like how was I supposed to know?\n\nTHEN, she just stood there and watched as I tried to put the footrest back down.  It was a good 30secs, at least, of watching me push down with my legs.  (I literally felt as though I was at the gym where the witch trainer, re:  blond saleslady, cackled as I was at the leg press machine that was set to heavy for me.)  She said, \"You'll be there for a while unless you pull down the lever!\"  Not in a friendly or funny way, but a mocking tone.\n\nI'm pretty good with judging people, but I think I was mistreated 'cause I look younger than I am and wasn't pushing a $500 baby stroller, and therefore, perhaps she perceived me as someone who did not have the money to spend in the store.  Think:  Julia Roberts in Pretty Woman when she goes into that boutique on Rodeo Dr.\n\nSorry lady, but even with money to burn at your store, I'd rather spend it elsewhere where each customer is treated with common decency, not judged based on appearance alone.
