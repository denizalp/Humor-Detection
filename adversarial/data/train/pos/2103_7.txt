They weren't serving mushroom quesadillas when I stopped by, so I tried a simple cheese one. The fresh corn tortilla was griddled with stringy white cheese, and I think I saw a little orange cheese in there, too. I really wasn't missing the mushrooms once I saw the extensive salsa bar selections, the most I've ever seen at a truck! They had two full rows of tasty taco condiments, including a chopped pineapple salsa and another featuring nopales (cactus), and a creamy avocado sauce. Estephanie's does attract a diverse clientele with those fresh, handmade tortillas. I opted to walk back to my car with my food rather than watch afternoon telenovelas in the taco tent with the gringa loca who was eating there and holding a conversation with an invisible companion (maybe the TV, but they weren't speaking the same language).
