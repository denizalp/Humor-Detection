Worst service I have ever experienced in my life!!\n\nI hate to be so harsh but this place has horrible customer service - Slow & Inattentive. This is the first week and this place is showing up lack of attention or missing orders. We ordered our food at 9 PM and at 9:45 they came back to us saying kitchen is closed and they cannot serve biryani but at the end they bill us for the unserved biryani.\nDuring dinner time in the whole restaurant they had only one person serving and we had to wait for 20 mins just to place our order and almost 40 mins to get out food ( with missing items).\n\nHope they improve their service quickly!!
