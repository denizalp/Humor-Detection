Surprisingly very clean, no resort fee, and conveniently located in the heart of Downtown Las Vegas.  There's nothing really amazing about the hotel... lobby is tiny, and parking is a bit of a struggle, but it does the job.  Nothing fancy in the hotel room, fairly standard with bed, desk, nightstand, and bathroom.  I didn't expect much as it's definitely not like the hotels on the strip.  Have low expectations and you won't be disappointed.  I was just happy the room and bathroom were clean and that it was fairly cheap!  It was perfect for us when we went to EDC (close to the speedway) and close to food\/shopping!
