Stopped by for dinner and wasn't disappointed. Been a while since going to one of these establishments and it was pretty busy but was seated immediately.. the classic cheeseburger was cooked to my liking and fries were much better than I expected. Sriracha shrimp n boneless wings for appetizers! Food was on point n attentive service was even better. Only thing I'd change is the timing between receiving food. Apps came out and entrees arrived about two minutes after.. other than that the dining experience was pretty cool, been a while since being here but impressed with the service, food, and dining experience.
