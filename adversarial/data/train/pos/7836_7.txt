I have waited for two years to write this review, for good reason. There is so much wrong with this university (loosely titled) that I kept wanting a reprieve from this post. However, I cannot honestly refrain any longer.\n\nI was bullied by professors. I was alienated by fellow students. I did not receive an education by any means. It was just easier to teach myself than disagree with the professors or challenge them on any issue. When I did confront a professor on their bullying behaviors, I was ostracized by administration and blacklisted by staff. DO NOT EVEN LISTEN TO THEIR RECRUITERS. When I tried to transfer credits to UC I was told I would only get half the units promised by UOP. What a crock. I wish there was a way I could have a larger forum to slam this organization, because they led me along just long enough to trap me into their system, and too late to start somewhere else. Trust me, and anyone else with similar posts...YOU WILL NOT LEARN HERE. You might as well go to the library and check out books. Nothing else will measure up.
