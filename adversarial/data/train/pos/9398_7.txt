This place went from really good to really bad after my second time ever being here. The stage went from being in the middle where it was nice and huge that you could sit around and throw money on it to becoming very small where you had to walk up every time just to throw money on. I also found it extremely rude that I had a smile on and one of the dancers just gave me a dirty look while shaking their head no to me. I guess fine then you don't want my money that's your loss not mine. Don't need to come back here again
