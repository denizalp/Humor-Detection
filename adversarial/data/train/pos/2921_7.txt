I would give it zero stars if I could.\n\nSigh.\n\nMy old friend was in town, and we hadn't seen each other in years.  We planned on getting together, having facials and massages, then laying around the pool all afternoon before a fancy dinner.\n\nI had a gift certificate from spafinder and thought that the spa at the Valley Ho seemed like a great choice!\n\nWe arrived 15 minutes early, were checked in, showed our robes, given lockers, and told to wait in the waiting room for our technicians to fetch us.\n\nWe waited.\nAnd waited.\nAnd waited.\n\nAfter approx 40 minutes (which went by fast as we're old friends and had a lot of catching up to do), I poked my head towards reception and was told \"We forgot you were here, we're sorting it out\"\n\nAnother 20 minutes pass, and employees start trying to devise plans to accomodate both of us and both of our appointments.  \n\nThe hour long wait cost us our much anticipated pool time, they put my friend in a hotel room with a mobile table for her massage, and my afternoon of relaxation turned to extreme anxiety and disappointment.\n\nThey did not apologize, simply took our money and turned their noses up at us.  \n\nThe worst of it is, I used my birthday GC on this piece of crap spa :(\nSuch a waste.
