Others have said it, and I agree: If you're coming to Vegas to prowl the Strip like a tiger on the hunt for trouble, booze and fabulous window shopping, then the Mirage has a primo location for a not so primo price. There is a whole star in my rating just for the location. If it were planted next to Mandalay Bay, it would be 3-stars. \n\nOn the surface, the Mirage is nice. There are just little things that make it not quite as nice as other properties. The bathroom is small without a magical garden tub that fills with scalding water in 3 seconds, and the shower head is quite sad. The blackout curtains are terrible! I always look forward to the power of a casino hotel blackout curtain, but these didn't really blackout much of anything. Plus, I have really been spoiled because I get frustrated when the curtains are not electric. You know you are bad when walking over to the curtain and pulling on a rod seems like an ordeal. \n\nThe decor was actually modern and fresh in a natural palette of colors. The bed was good. Everything felt clean and new with little sign of wear. \n\nFor some reason, I had decided that I needed a volcano view. Blame it on nostalgia because my first trip to Vegas I stayed at the Mirage with my now husband, then boyfriend, and we had a volcano view. However, on this trip, I was wondering what the heck I was thinking every time the jungle drums started up and fire starting spurting. The volcano view is not the same as a fountain view at the Bellagio, trust me.  \n\nWe had no problems with service, had a fun couple of dances in the Revolution Lounge, but we didn't really have an amazing meal on property. \n\nIf you are looking for a Vegas headquarters with the attitude of \"really how much time am I going to spend in my room\" but want a nicer place, the Mirage works quite nicely, but if you are really looking to go super posh, you may want to look elsewhere.
