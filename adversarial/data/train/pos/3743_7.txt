This is one of the best shows in Vegas, so they say. And it is good. Water, fire, hot chicks and dudes, and a stage that will wow you with it's fire and smoke. However, I will say, that if you have been to Cirque du Soleil productions, it is not quite as good. It does not have the finess that they do and it is in English, which is great if you are Beatles Love, but if you are a love story, it needs to be in French which keeps you guessing, or some other language.\n\nI would not recommend this as you first show in Vegas, but if it is your first, you'll probably like it. We liked Ka and O best.
