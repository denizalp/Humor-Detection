Decent enough froyo. The roadside signage is so nondescript that I drive past this place daily on my way to and from work and have never noticed it. The location itself, once you turn into the plaza, is hidden from the street because it is behind another building. Problematic, but alleviated with good advertising.\n\nWent in and there was another solo chick leaving with her cup of dessert. Layout of store is a little odd: cups and toppings by door, then yogurt dispensers, followed by more toppings and the register, where you are finally addressed by an employee.\n\nOpted to mixed a few flavors: the cookies and cream was on the bland side, but the Tahitian vanilla and dark chocolate were both very good. For toppings, I added strawberries (not many left), cherries, and a sprinkle of peanuts for crunch. Topping selection overall seems to be on the slim side, though I can't tell you what they were missing.\n\nService was polite. TVs inside were tuned to SportsCenter and the Spurs game. Now that this place is on my radar, it's the closest froyo to home. Will likely be stopping by on my way home from bad days at work.
