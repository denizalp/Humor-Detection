Five, impossible.\n\nFour stars for the interesting design of the place. \n\nThree stars for the fact they sell warm & soft pretzels at their concessions. \n\nTwo stars for the crazed Chief Illiniwek fans that still stand up during halftime - even though the UIUC was forced to ban the racist mascot from their games. (Yes, I just went there.)\n\nOne star for the lack of creativity with the cement interior and uncomfortable seating.\n\n\nAll that averages to about two and a half. So, I guess, let's go with three?
