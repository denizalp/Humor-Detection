If I could give this place 10 Stars...I would! I travel all the way from Buckeye a couple times a week to visit Butt Out. It is well worth the drive to receive quality customer service, great liquid, and a totally awesome atmosphere! The staff here always makes you feel comfortable and never rushes you. It's NEVER about them getting a \"Sale\", its about them getting what you need no matter how long it takes or how many liquids you sample. When I first started Vaping, I was really nervous coming into the shop,  thought I wasn't going to understand and feel awkward, the staff put an end to that feeling real quick and now I'm a regular customer! I see new comers walk in and look nervous like I did, they always leave with a smile and I'm sure they will be regulars moving forward. My advice is...go to Butt Out for all your Vaping needs, they're AWESOME!!!
