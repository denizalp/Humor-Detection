I went here with some friends for dinner since we were craving for some sushi and thought this would be a good place for that. Out of the few times I have been here for dinner, there has always been a wait so I guess that just shows how popular the place is. \n\nWe ordered a bunch of items, but I would recommend getting the Yuzu Hamachi and the garlic tuna nigiri! Both are really flavorful and delicious. I ended up eating like 4 pieces of each lol! In terms of rolls I would recommend trying the orange blossom roll (it is my favorite at the moment). I really like the citrusy taste along with the crunch from the tempura. I also got to try the ribeye appetizer along with the soft shell crab. My friend got ramen (IDK why he did that), but it tasted okay. I'm pretty sure the vast selection of appetizers you can pick from is just there to bait you, so I would recommend just trying 1 or 2 and focusing most of your energy and stomach space on the sushi! I would also get the 2 cucumber wrapped rolls (I think one is called the Naruto and I forgot the other, but they are listed next to each other). I have always wanted to try the chicken katsu, but I think that would fill me up relatively fast. \n\nYou can also order more than 1 dessert item here so I would recommend the red bean and green tea ice cream scoop. \n\nI would recommend checking this place out if you want a sushi place that has a decent selection of items that goes beyond sushi. I would give this place 3.5 stars, but since I can't do that, I will be generous and give them 4 stars lol!
