I went to Metrocenter Mall today because I am looking for a dog, and there was one particular dog housed at the Halo Adoption Center there.  I went to the mall with my wife, and there is not much there.  So many closed and abandoned stores.  Not many stores left.  I would not normally be shopping here.  \n\nEither this mall needs to reinvent itself, or it will be bulldozed eventually for something else.
