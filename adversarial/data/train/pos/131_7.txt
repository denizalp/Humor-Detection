Anyone who knows me knows that Im not usually the biggest fan of Italians or the culture but this place is not the loud, orange skinned, pinky ring types.  This is the old world, European Italians.  The building is over a 100 years old and second generation family still owns it.  Great old pics on the wall and cool stuff to look at!  Being from out of town we bough shelf-stable stuff to go but the cheese and fresh pasta look amazing.  Had we had more time I would of looked around longer.  Prices are great and selection is dizzing.  Even the checkout lady was fun and that Yinzer accent made my shriveled heart swoon....
