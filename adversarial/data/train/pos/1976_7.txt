Don't get me wrong.. Love the food, the food is obviously amazing, but I am not happy with the customer service. One night I went in and ordered the 8 piece family meal (to go) with 1 large side and 4 biscuits. When I arrived home, I was only given 7 pieces of chicken, instead of 8. It may not seem like a big deal, but it sucks if it's something you paid for. Let me give you an example.. It's friday night, you just had a long busy day at work, all you want to do is relax, eat some food and get the long weekend started. Now Imagine you ordered a pizza delivered to your house, you give the driver his 30 bucks including tip and hes gone. You open up the pizza, and you notice 1 slice of pizza is gone! Wouldn't that piss you off and be like wtf!? You are going to do something about that right?! So I called the place (I believe I was speaking to the manager) and let him know. He asked for my order # which would be on the receipt. He said without the receipt, their is nothing he can do for me. Well that sucks, because I was never given a receipt when I orginally made my purchase!!! I am 100% positive that I was never given a receipt. He took my order and gave me all my food right on the spot, it was really quick. Anyways, he basically did not believe me, was being totally rude, and was trying to argue with me on the phone. Why would I lie about something like this? I've worked many years in the customer service industry, and I would of handled it totally different. You know how much chicken these guys make? Just give me my damn 1 piece of chicken, and make me a happy customer! Or at least something to make sure I am satisfied with the service. Now due to this poor service, I am writing this negative review on Yelp, when it could of been a positive one instead. Obviously saving one piece of chicken is far more important than customer satisfaction. Sorry guys.
