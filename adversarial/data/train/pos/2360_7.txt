Uncle Joe's Pizza is a local staple and located in the non-tourist area of Fremont Street. It is legit New York. Big floppy slices and real ingredients. They have a one-topping carryout special for $10 (cheaper for a small group than the 2 slices for $4 special for individuals). I get a plain cheese... and fold those puppies up. \nHOLD THE PHONE... they DELIVER TOO??? My fat-girl quest to wash myself with a rag on a stick might hit sooner knowing this tidbit of information.... Mmmmm! Lazy + delicious + cheap = extra chins
