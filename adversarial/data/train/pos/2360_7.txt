Wow.  Found a location without a 2 hour wait!  We heard about AZ's love affair with DB and wanted to check it out.\n\nWe tried the Crazy Hawaiian Freeze and a Chocolate Banana Frost.  We both liked it and they had great flavor.\n\nThe best part was Haley.  So warm and loving.  She held our hand  and thoughtfully explained everything.  She is Awesome!\n\nWe will be back!
