If you like chocolate and alcohol, then you'll love this bar! It's a small bar located by the Hershey's shop inside the N.Y N.Y hotel. I got the caramel chocolate martini which was good It was made strong too-:) It's not cheap. I think that drink cost $15. There is a Reese's one too which I should've gotten instead, but oh well. \n\nI'll get that next time! There are only about 15 seats at the bar maybe, so this isn't a good place for large groups. That's O.K as you can walk around with your drink of course! The bartender made the drink really fast! I think that my drink was made in about a minute! While your there, check out the chocolate statue of liberty inside the Hershey's store.
