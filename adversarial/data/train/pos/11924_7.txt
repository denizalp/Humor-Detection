I am going to give this location 5-stars just to even out the idiotic people (Jeff G. and Mike K.) who reviewed the wait time of a restaurant that has just opened up.\n\nHere is a fact of life: when popular restaurants open up at a new location, said location will have extremely long and abnormal wait times for at least 1-2 months.  This varies depending on the restaurant and the area.\n\nI don't know why anyone would go to this Oregano's with the ridiculous expectation of being seated immediately and served their order within 15-20 minutes.\n\nThis place is brand new!\n\nPeople are still learning, it is incredibly popular, there are tons of visitors here for Spring Training, and there should be an understanding of what to expect.
