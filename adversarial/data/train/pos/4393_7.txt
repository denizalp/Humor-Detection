Excellent, authentic, hole in the wall Ethiopian joint!!!\n\nWent with some Yelp friends and had the Abugida feast (with Beef and Chicken)! A great way to sample a little bit of everything. The flavor of the beef was amazing but those spicy lentils were out of this world.\n\nVery helpful and friendly staff and very reasonable prices.\n\nGreat place for a food adventure to get you out of your comfort zone and try something new! I didn't know the names of anything I was eating but it was all good!!!!\n\nHear they have an awesome coffee ceremony!
