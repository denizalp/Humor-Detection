On Wednesday Sept 9, 2015 I called to see if they had a particular firearm. The rep on the phone said they did have it and gave me an unbelievable price for the gun. I then asked if it was the old or new model ( the old model had lot's of problems). Their rep said that the gun was the \"new\" model but that it had been shipped to them in the old style box from the factory. With the price and description I was given, I'd be a fool not to go right down there and buy the gun. I made the trip there expecting the gun I was looking for. Instead, when I got there the gun was clearly the old model. What a way to do business. Are they just hoping that their customers are stupid? Won't go there again.
