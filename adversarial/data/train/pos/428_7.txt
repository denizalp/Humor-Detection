Wow, I got to say this place has been gutted with all new furniture, which explains why they closed down.  When you walk in you feel welcom, it could be the attentiveness of the staff.  That doesn't stop at the door, they continue to check on you and ask if everything is fine.  Shocking right?!  That's a 180 degree turn from what I been used to at these establishments. \n\nSo since service was on point, you all probably want to know how was the food.  Well, let me describe each with a small description.\n\nRoasted hen with noodles - all I need to say is the flavor was non stop! A winner.\n\nRoasted hen with tomato rice - kids loved it and it came with pickled daikon and carrots - YES!\n\nBeef and broccoli with steam rice - healthy choice. Ok....\n\nRice plate with two items - egg meatloaf delish. Pork had alot of fat; bummer, planning to get the beef next time instead of pork.  \n\nWill be back as this might be my regular stop again.
