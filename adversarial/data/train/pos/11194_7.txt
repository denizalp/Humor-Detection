I love pomegranate seeds so why would Pomegranate Cafe be any different? \n\nThis little mix matched spot is adorable, it's what my Pinterest boards dream to look like. Wooden tables, chairs with fresh words on them, mason jars EVERYWHERE and all fresh ingredients to boot. \n   I've had a sun warrior smoothie and the Raw! Tacos which were to die for. The walnut meat was spicy and delicious wrapped up in cabbage leaves. I'm hooked on their food pairings and the vibe they give off. \n\nP. S. Their dessert selection is to die for. Lemon bars? Gluten free goodness.
