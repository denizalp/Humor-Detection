Didn't like the place walked out as fast as I walked in. Not much beauty supply's here, stock seemed low and I didn't feel welcomed no one greeted me just heard awkward laughing from employees in the back of store. Came in for a wig but although good prices didn't have a large selection. Place was a bit dirty. Took my business elsewhere.
