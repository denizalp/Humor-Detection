Wandering around Fremont, my friend and I needed, yes needed, a slice of pizza cap off our night.\n\nWe stopped by Pop Up Pizza, she ordered a slice of meatball with kalamata olives and onions and I ordered the eggplant with sausage, pepperoni and red peppers. They were warmed up quickly and I enjoyed the toppings and the dough was solid too, but I had hoped it would be cooked a little more evenly. My friends was nicely cooked and had a nice char, but mine was on the doughy side.\n\nOverall, I enjoyed my pizza, but found the dough to be a little inconsistent.
