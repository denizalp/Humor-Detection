This experience was really just EH.\n\nThe location is not in the best part of town and it's located in a strip mall so we didn't immediately find it at night because the sign out front is just a black poster with white letters. The building is kind of shabby and not somewhere I would normally go.\n\nThe main waiting area is nice enough and there's pictures all over the walls, and other photo albums filled with more pictures, of people who have done the various puzzles. I had to use the bathroom and I wish i had gone back at the hotel before we came because it was either really old or just dirty. The theme of dirty seemed to run throughout the rest of my experience.\n\nWe did the room that had the haunted daycare and yes it was challenging, but I really did not feel comfortable touching anything in there. The whole thing seemed thrown together and they got all the toys from people who did not gently use them. The dolls were dirty, the stuffed animals were dirty, and there were a lot of them. The whole room was dark and you had to use an old dirty lamp to try and see everything.\n\nHonestly I do appreciate that the puzzle wasn't too easy, but I would have appreciated it more if I wasn't afraid that i was going to touch something gross if I reached in somewhere or that I was breathing in mold and dust just by being in the room. \n\nSo yes the puzzle was challenging but I really don't like dirty things and places so I probably won't be going back.
