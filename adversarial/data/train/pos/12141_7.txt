The standard mix of Italian bistro foods, but everything's the most delicious version of it.\n\nThere has to be at least 20 different Wolfgang Puck restaurants along the Strip. I've tried a bunch of them, and so far Bar & Grill is the standout.\n\nJ'adore jdori chicken! This has to be one of the juiciest, best-prepared half chickens I've eaten in a restaurant maybe ever. It's so simple but great quality with a delicious crispy skin.\n\nThe upscale yet casual menu & ambiance give a great in-between for those looking for good food without the stuffiness of some of the fancier restaurants nearby.\n\n**TIP FOR THE SPORTS-HEAD** The bar plays the games at low volume, making it the ideal spot to catch a game & a good meal. Bartenders are friendly & attentive too.
