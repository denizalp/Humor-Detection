This place was cute, but pretty average.\n\nOur server kept trying to rush us to order because he had a party of 15 he was trying to help as well. We sat down and felt super rushed into ordering he kept saying if we didn't order now the part of 15s order was going to go in before ours and it was going to take way longer to get our food.\n\nThe food was nothing spectacular. Tasted like pretty much every other Mexican restaurant I've been to.\n\nWe ordered fried ice cream and bananas for dessert and to light them on fire they poured a full shot of tequila over it. All we could taste was tequila it made it pretty much inedible. \n\nDecent food but nothing I would recommend.
