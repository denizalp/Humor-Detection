I had some visitors from corporate in town - one for our annual operations inspection, one to have a look at some of the tactical marketing we're developing in my region.  Anyway, they wanted to eat here so...\n\nHere we were at Traders Vics.  The atmosphere is nice, island themed opulence and texturally pleasing.  We were greeted very warmly and sat in the bar for cocktails and a snack before dinner.  The drinks were tasty.  The appetizer \"tidbits for two\" varied from good to uninteresting.\n\nWe moved on to the dining room.  It was a Thursday night and the place was D ecidedly E mpty A nd D evoid (DEAD) of customers.  I tried one of the specials which was some sort of Thai inspired noodles with curry and some seafood and peanut and some mild pepper spiciness and...and...and...I frankly don't remember what it was supposed to be because it frankly wasn't anything.  Too many things going on, nothing made a big impression.  \n\nThe other diners apparently chose better because 2\/3 of them were happy with their dinner.  Wait, if there were 4 of us and I wasn't thrilled and only 2 of the other 3 diners were happy that means that 2 of the 4 or 50% of the diners were underwhelmed.  Now if Trader Vic's had been traveling north on a train at 75 mph and had 160 miles to travel...wait I think I just had a flashback to sixth grade math.  \n\nOk, my bottom line impression of Trader Vic's - kind of cool atmosphere, interesting history (I think they were owned by Merv Griffin) and the food was average at a premium price.   Oh and the bathrooms were very nice.
