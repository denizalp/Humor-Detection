HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE GOOD NAIL TECHNICIANS.  I like the girls that work here but the owners act like they don't need your business. I've been placed on hold and forgotten three time I've called, been told there are no appointments only to drive by and see the are not busy, once I even made an appt only to get there and be told they didn't have time to do what I wanted done. I really get aggravated every time I have to call, and just started going to Polished Too down the street. It's cheaper, nail artists are just as good, and WAYYYYY better customer service.
