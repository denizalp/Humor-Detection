My co-worker encouraged me to grab a drink here and see the show on the Lake of Dreams. I read accolades for their Coquito, but Coquito is a seasonal drink for December (I should have known) so grabbed a Sinatra Smash made with muddled blackberries, vanilla, and Jack Daniel's Wynn Single Barrel. This was very good and strong! Their Beets appetizer was delicious. The show was more like an exhibition and was over within 2 minutes. Pleasant experience. Both servers, Maria and Lucia were attentive, informative, and pleasant.
