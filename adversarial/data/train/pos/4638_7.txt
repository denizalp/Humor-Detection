Still by far an amazing place to eat when compared to Any of the restaurants in vegas. I have been here several times. Its one of the few places where people who love fresh fish and people who dont eat fish can still have a delicious meal. I recommend getting the blue fin tuna or the kampachi off of the specials menu . Its near impossible to go wrong with ordering anything here. I think its great for date night or even with one or two friends. Seating is limited, so its not recommended that you try and go without reservations. Definitely plan ahead and call but its well worth it. Great staff, great food, great atmosphere ...definitely gets a 5 star rating in my book
