Food: 2.5\/5\nService:2.5\/5\nAmbiance: 3\/5\n\nI was stoked when this new pizza joint opened and was dying to try the food here. I've enjoyed some of the best dishes in many parts of the Italy.  Italian owner from Amalfi cost + Authentic pizza = uber high expectations.\n\nWent for lunch on Thursday. Didn't make a reservation. Showed up at 11:45 a.m. and no one was at the restaurant- best time to go if you do not have reservation.\n\nI entered thru the Elm street entrance (there are 2 entrances). There's no sign from outside. You walk in to the YMCA building and the entrance is to your right. Note: You won't be greeted if you enter through Elm Street entrance. \nI got to pick where I wanted to sit when I walked in. \n  \nService: Server was very pushy- we needed more time to look at the menu but she kept coming back every 3 min. \n\nFood: We ordered linguine all scoglio (seafood linguine), quattro stagioni and napoletana pizza to share. \nQuattro stagioni: Who divides 4 toppings into 4 sections? I've never ever seen that anywhere. It was ridiculous and wasn't an enjoyable experience to share that pizza. \n\nNapoletana: Uber salty and unappetizing. All the toppings were on one side of the pizza. \n\nLinguine all scoglio: they skimped on seafood- tiny pieces of chopped calamari was sprinkled on top with couple of clams and mussels. Price tag $20.50. \n\nAll dishes were very very salty....all of us kept drinking water all day after lunch. If you are watching your sodium intake, this place ain't for you.  \n\nAmbiance: not very inviting. \n\nI was quite disappointed with the food and service. I'd rather spend that $60 somewhere else.
