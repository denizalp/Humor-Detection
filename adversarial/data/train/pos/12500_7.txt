I don't eat a lot of sugar, so I didn't make it a point to check this place out when it opened. And for that same reason, I didn't really expect to like it. So when my employer decided to show us some love by way of ice cream sandwiches (hold the wheat bread and lettuce), I had very low expectations.\n\nThat being said, this was a mf-ing TREAT.\n\nSnickerdoodle cookie, mint chocolate chip ice cream, brownie with rainbow sprinkles. The cookie was soft, the brownie was not too rich and held together nicely. I have zero complaints, even with the fact that it was transported to my office in a cup. \n\nEnjoy your sugar high!
