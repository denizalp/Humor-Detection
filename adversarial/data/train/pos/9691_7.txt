I love Jason's Deli! Perfect place where there is multiple items everyone in the family can get. Tons of menu options! The restaurant is huge and kept clean! You walk up to order, get a number and then they will bring you your food. \n\nThey have an awesome huge salad bar. You can purchase a 1 time trip to Salad bar or all you can eat. The salad bar has all the normal fixings and more...tons of dressing choices, pasta salad, corn, pudding, corn bread, you name it! \n\nMy husband got \"The Rachel\" sandwich and loved it. Nice size sandwich and a ton of meat. I got the plain Jane baked potato and the thing was MASSIVE!!! size of a regular size plate! Easily be an entire meal or split with someone. It was delicious though. \n\nThey even have complimentary soft serve ice cream to finish off your meal. We come here all the time and\nIt never disappoints. Great place to bring the whole family where you can get something tasty, something healthy, kid friendly and all. We will be back soon.
