It has been a couple of months since I have eaten at this Earl of Sandwich.  In planning my trip to Las Vegas next week, I am writing this review because I am eagerly anticipating eating here again. \n\nThis Earl of Sandwich at the Palms is much smaller than the other Las Vegas location at Planet Hollywood.  The options are limited, but they do have the primary menu items and has served me quite well.  I have enjoyed all of the sandwiches that I have tried from here, but my two favorites are The Original and The Full Montagu.  Both have excellent flavor and blend perfectly with the toasted bread.  I also always get a side of potato salad, which I love here.\n\nWhen I go to Las Vegas next week, I definitely plan on stopping by the Palms and eating at the Earl of Sandwich.  It is a must have whenever I am in town!
