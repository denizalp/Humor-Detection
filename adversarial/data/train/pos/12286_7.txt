After our first night of bottle service, our 2nd night we were not ready to spend that type of money again so we decided to just come early and try lining up.\n\nWe were there around 10 pm and the 3rd group in line.  \n\nThe bouncher came by and asked us if we had bottle service.  After we replied no.  He asked if we could step over the red rope so he could talk to us.\n\nWe were tricked!\n\nAs soon as we got out of line the guy was like I can't do a group of guys this big dressed the way we were.\n\nReally?!?!?\n\nI wasn't expecting to be let in right away but tricked to get out of line so there wouldn't be a scene.  Screw this place.
