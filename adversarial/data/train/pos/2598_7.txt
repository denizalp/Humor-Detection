Calling yourself #1 at anything just invites judgement, and makes the disappointment of dismal product even worse. I ordered a bento box to try several meats (pork, ribs, mahi) for a quick takeout lunch. Food took longer than expected to come out, and when I opened the box back at my desk, it was the wrong order. I had an overwhelming portion of chicken katsu. The chicken itself was fine, slightly dry but nicely crispy, tasty katsu sauce. But the mac salad was drowning in mayo, the rice was mushy, and oh yeah- it's totally not what I ordered. Didn't finish the portion, tossed the leftovers. I was one of two customers, not sure how the single front of house employee got so confused.
