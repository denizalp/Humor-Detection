Cheap but centrally located on the Strip. Otherwise, disappointing, mostly for their fitness center. I was expecting The Best from Bally's, whose health clubs were the state of the art. Alas, cardio machines with no individual TV's and no sound??!! and purple weight machines Bally's appears to have picked up from a second-hand sale at Planet Fitness!??? Why so sucky a fitness center?? MAJOR FAIL!\n\nThe room was a torture chamber of antique, ugly furniture from 1983. I could not use the desk. Also played, \"search for available plugs,\" a little game I've come to hate, and instantly dislike any establishment that makes me participate as the first thing I must do in the room in 2017. Bathroom shower curtain and fixtures were ancient, but matched the rest of the awful d√©cor. Weird elevators: You hear one arrive, but unless you're standing in front of it, you must frantically search for the open door! Another stupid game?\n\nIn contrast, Check-In and Check-out was State of the Art: Very easy, automated, and efficient. I also liked the option of having room service or credit toward purchases charged to the room for hotel restaurants. As with everywhere in Vegas, I found service in the hotel and casino extremely friendly and professional.
