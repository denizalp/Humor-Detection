Imagine a huge pyramid with no working toilet. This is the case with Luxor.\n\nLuxor is slowly falling apart from the inside and has the worst infrastructure I have seen in years. \n\nThis was my first trip to Las Vegas and with Las Vegas hotels. I got a fantastic deal from Expedia from Saturday night at December 28, 2013 to Monday Dec 30, 2013 for 2 nights. I have never visited Las Vegas so I was just going by the reviews and hoping for the best. Very Disappointed.\n\nHere are the things a normal 2 star hotel like, say, Comfort Inn has over overpriced Luxor.\n\nFree Wifi \nFree Breakfast\nClean Bathrooms - we found hair and condoms on the floor...really....\nProper Outlets - The plugs keep falling out of the outlets. We could not charge the iPhones because their outlet system was ancient and we literally could not plug in the chargers since the connection was too loose. We had only one proper outlet and for the others, we had to literally HOLD the charger close to the port. Can you imagine a Comfort Inn without a proper outlet?\nProper Wired Internet -  Our Wired Internet (for which we paid our resort fee)  did not work because of the room's ancient infrastructure. The man from the front office who had to fix this issue just peace'd out on us because it was late. We spent over 3 hours with his man. 3 hours we could have spent exploring Las Vegas.\n\nThe food for which we were given discounts for was overpriced.\n\nOur Last Day in Vegas, we shifted to a 2 star hotel. It was nothing much but it had all these things and it was much more satisfying. \n\nRecommendation: Don't. A star exterior with a D star interior.
