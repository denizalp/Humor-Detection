i just bought a new house at the beginning of the year. i purchased a home warranty when i bought the house and used it when i was having garage door issues. the company that came out was precision overhead door. the warranty company wouldn't pay for proper repairs. i checked reviews on the company (4-4.5 stars) and bought their top of the line unit. thankfully i've never had problems with the door opener. here is the problem with this company. they use their own name brand opener. i needed to have my key pad pin changed so that i don't have any unwanted guests (falling out with family). i was looking for how to change the code for the keypad online but couldn't find it. i called the company and they said that they would have to come out to reprogram the system. this cost about $100.00. i spent $900.00+- to have them put a system that they will need to service anytime i need to make a change. make sure to use a use a company that utilizes a name brand user friendly opener like a lift master. the worst part is they have several helpfully videos on how to change the pin on several different brands except their own. i called the local office and they said their is nothing they could do for me. beware
