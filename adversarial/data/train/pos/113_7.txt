It might be part of a franchise, but I prefer to rate the place based on the food. While I have had better, this place is good!\n\nWalking in for a late dinner at 9:00 tonight, we were warmly greeted and seated immediately. The waiter must be new, because he's a character. Lots of smiles and humor as he took care of us. Almost too much!\n\nI went with the all-you-can-eat ribs ($10.99) and they were fall-off-the-bone. Nicely cooked, my first plate had four of them. Very meaty, though perhaps not as hot (temperature-wise) as I expect. I decided to have a second plate, which had three large ribs. These were just as good and were served at the right temperature. The cole slaw seemed processed and the mac & cheese was only barely warm, but the cornbread was fresh and delicious.\n\nMy eating partner had the all-you-can-eat chicken ($7.99) with a baked sweet potato and baked beans. The potato was rather small and the beans had a lot of bbq sauce mixed through. (Other available sides are green beans, baked potato, fries, and others I can't remember.)\n\nThe ribs and chicken are only barely sauced. Instead at the table are four squeeze bottles of sauces - mild, smoky, smoky sweet and spicy. They're all good, but I prefer a mustard bbq sauce.\n\nAll of the sides are also included with the all-you-can-eat as are the drinks. They have a very delicious sweet tea, fountain coke products and Bud\/Bud Light on tap.\n\nWe skipped dessert, but did bring some bbq shredded pork home, which looks great. They put in two tubs of cole slaw and good sized packets of each of the sauces.
