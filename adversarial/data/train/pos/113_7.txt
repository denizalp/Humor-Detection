There are so many great things about Grinders!  Rotating Art from local artists (and not the ones trying their hardest to win the next hipster award), live music with great jazz bands, excellent coffee and tea reasonably priced. The fourth star is awarded for the pecan\/cream cheese Danish thing the server recommended. It was so good I couldn't decide weather to scarf it down or savor each bite.
