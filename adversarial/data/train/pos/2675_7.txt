The service was slow. I should have known after I stood at the hostess stand for a minute or three and was promptly ignored and so I took my own seat. A few staff went past twice or three times until one of them noticed that I was still hanging onto a menu. I ordered a soda and ten wings from one staffer and they were delivered by a different staffer.\n\nPositives\nMy drink was refilled when it was noticed to be down to the ice cubes.\nBlue cheese dressing was chunky.\nFree wifi worked nicely.\n\nNegatives\nThe \"hot\" wings seemed too coated in sauce.\nServices was slow to none.
