Every time I eat at Bo's, I remember Robert Murphy doing their ads on BIG WAYS radio circa 1979. He was the funniest morning DJ ever to work in Charlotte, a legend, really. We lost him to Chicago, but that's another story. His straight man of 1000 voices sidekick, Larry Sprinkle, is still doing weather at WCNC TV.\n\nAnyway, Murphy MADE Bojangles a success here. You couldn't hear his Bojangles spots without wanting their coffee and their buttermilk biscuits, their dirty rice and their cajun-spiced fried chicken. One mention, and I'd be heading that way... drooling on my tie.\n\nBojangles is our local phenomenon, started in a little restaurant in South Charlotte. If you're a visitor, this is our contribution to fast-food-chain America. Try it; it's a guilty pleasure. It's not good for your cholesterol level or your waistline, but it tastes like pure comfort.\n\nMost locations are great. Don't miss the buttermilk biscuits! I know Northerners and Westerners who have to pig out at Bo's or they don't think they came to Charlotte.
