I love In-N-Out Burger. I salivate over the Animal-Style double cheeseburger + fries and a diet soda. So bad for you, but so good. No, it isn't the best, meatiest, most original burger ever, and the fries are kind of soggy sometimes and forgettable, but all that is meaningless when you pull in, expecting to either stand around and cast a hawk-eye for any soon-to-be vacated seats in the crowded eatery, or resign yourself to consuming your greasy feast in your car, made that much better by In-N-Out's well-executed cardboard container trays. \n\nI like the reputation of In-N-Out for being a good company, who treats it employees well and pays them decently. I like how this reputation seemingly trickles down to my actual experiences with the employees, who are always chipper and efficient (sans Chick-Fil-A's sometimes eerily robotic, hyper cheeriness). I like that the restaurant I frequent when I'm in Vegas always seems to be quite clean, and that the price is so reasonable for a luscious burger and fries with a drink ($7 and some change). I appreciate the nifty cardboard container trays that display your food neatly so you can consume on-the-go, in your car, or if necessary, standing up because there are no seats available. And goodness, that legendary \"Animal-style\" burger is so, so delicious: two thin, crispily-laced burger patties, cool crunchy pickles, melty hot cheese, grilled onions that manage not to reek, and richly fatty sauce, all sandwiched between two warm, soft but sturdy buttery\/toasted buns. Add those little shoestring fries and an ice-cold Diet Coke and I am SO HAPPY. And, although the feast is a caloric bust, I don't feel gross and sickly like I do after eating at most other fast food chains.\n\nSO good, I guess it is a good thing for my waistline that there isn't an In-N-Out in my residency.
