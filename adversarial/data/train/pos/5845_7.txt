Domino's Fact:  There are more than 34 million ways to create a single Domino's pizza.\n\nI wasn't going to review a Domino's but I think this location needs a little love! Look at their ratings. Yikes.\n\nSo we stopped in after grabbing some hard ciders one night only to find ourselves ordering from a giant tablet. A short wait later, we were walking out with a piping hot pizza and some sizeable wings. I dig. Also, any pizza place that still uses cornmeal in their crust is boss in my book. As for the wings, they're pretty good. They a good size with just enough pucker.\n\nThe location is decently clean and the staff was helpful. It was a hectic St. Paddy's Day so service and food was more than fine. Are they a five star pizza place? Of course not! But comparing all the other fast food pizza joints out there, they're really not that bad. Toppings are plentiful and spread evenly, they're not overly greasy, and the price is decent. They always have specials going on so don't forget to take a peak before ordering.
