Sitting on the outside deck and enjoying an iced coffee in a beautiful Montreal day.\n\nLocated right around the corner from Hotel 10 where we were staying for the week this coffee shop is a wonderful reprieve to while away some time and relax under the shade while sipping on a tasty iced coffee.\n\nThey have one of those streetside outside deck seating areas which seems to be a really cool thing in Montreal. Wish they did this in NYC. We took our drinks and pastries and sat here for an hour or so conversing and checking our emails. Relaxing and chilling.\n\nNice inside decor, bright, spacious, clean, and quiet. Polite and friendly staff. Free wifi. Good prices on coffee drinks.\n\nVery nice coffee joint off a side street and in a great location by the hotel. Worth a visit if staying there.
