At first I was a little bummed when my husband picked the Residence Inn for our stay in Las Vegas but it turned out to be a very good stay for many reasons.\n \nIt was quiet at night so I could sleep and didn't hear the loud noises from the strip.\n\nThe bed was comfortable.\n\nThe shower was easy to work and didn't run out of hot water.\n\nVery close, easy and abundant parking.\n\nWalking distance to Monorail. (saves lots of $ on Taxis)\n\nFree Breakfast. (They offer complimentary dinner Buffet Monday-Thursday)\n\nThe full size fridge was good for holding gallons of water.\n\nDog Friendly.\n\nI do admit the decor isn't the most exciting but it seemed very clean so I wasn't afraid to sit on the furniture like I was at the Cosmopolitan where I thought I'd catch a disease or get pregnant from siting on the furniture.\n\nThe only downside I can think up at the moment was the free Wifi was slow in our room so we used a hot box.\n\nIt was a good stay I'd return!
