I was referred to Dr. Mosharrafa by my surgeon for breast reduction surgery.  I was impressed by his bedside manner and the office staff seemed very professional and friendly.  I told Dr. M. that is was important that he understand what I wanted from the surgery (small breasts) because my insurance was paying for it and I have had friends tell me go smaller as you tend to \"grow\" as you get older.  I cut out pictures, bought a size 36C bra, and I spoke with the surgery nurse to let her know how I felt.  I was told by Dr. M in my consultation \"I hear you loud and clear\".\nI ended up going from a 36DDD to a 36DD.  I still have groves in my shoulders, neck pain and told Dr. M how disappointed I was.  \nLong story short, don't use him if you know what you want, he will do what only what he wants and disregard the feelings of the patient.  His response to me was to redo the surgery and charge me $6,000.00 (a discount he said). \nI think if you are going to use Dr. M for a breast augmentation, you shouldn't have a problem.
