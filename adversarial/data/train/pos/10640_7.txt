Came here with a group of friends and was overall surprised with my meal. Service is what you would expect, good. You must order the grilled octopus! It was simple but delicious. The filet and rib eye were a force to be reckoned with. Almost as good as CUT. The whole fish baked in rock salt was suppose to be the star of the night but I thought it was just OK. Bread service kinda sucked lol
