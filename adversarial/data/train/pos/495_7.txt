If only I had read the reviews before I went to this place!  This was my first colon hydrotherapy visit and I sure hope they aren't all like this place.  Just a few of my complaints about this place:\n\nAs a first time client I expected at least some personal interaction and explanation of the process ahead of time.  She asked if I had any questions, but it was clear she had no desire to answer them.  \n\nI was extremely disappointed to discover that this is basically a do it yourself process.  I expected that the THERAPIST would act as such and be involved int he process beyond just checking in on me once and giving me instructions on how to turn the machine one. \n\nFor my second appointment (I prepaid for 2 appointments, always beware of any place that makes you prepay!)  I waited for 30 minutes past my appointment time and no one bothered to tell me how much longer it would be.  When I went up to the desk to check there wasn't even anyone there, forcing me to leave a note.  I left without having my 2nd session.  I have a schedule to maintain like everyone else and being made to wait so long with no explanation is unacceptable.\n\nAnd, having the televisions all tuned to Fox News and Court TV (with several notes placed throughout the office stating DO NOT TOUCH) during the sessions is probably not the best choice.  I don't think listening to details of a murder trial while having a colonic is a very health supporting practice.
