My friends and I were trying to figure out what show we wanted to see when celebrating our birthdays. Cirque de Soleil is great but we've seen so many of their shows and we were ready for something different. My friend suggested Thunder from Down Under. I was expecting lots of cheesiness. The thing is.... Vegas is cheesy - and that's why we love it. We had a blast watching the gorgeous Australian men in their magic and glory showing off their six packs and flexing their shiny gluteal muscles. It was a feast of the feasts. The kind of eye candy that will most likely cure blindness one day. Our cheeks and abs got a major workout from the excessive laughter. When the show ended and the lights were turned on, we just looked at each other, completely speechless. After a while, we picked up our jaws from the floor and joined the line to have a picture taken with the entire Aussie entourage. We usually joke around and flirt but we were like four mesmerized human robots who just plopped themselves on their laps, smiled for the camera and got our butt slapped upon our departure. It was magical and we spent hours staring at the pictures; some of them got posted on Facebook with tons of \"likes\" and I turned one of them into a Christmas card. We'll be back!
