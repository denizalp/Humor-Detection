Melrose Pharmacy in the past has been reliable but lately they have been sloppy and appear to care less and less about their customers. In the last few months I've had prescription refills not properly sent out to my doctor, prescriptions have been lost, I have been shorted multiple times on prescriptions with an IOU. \n\nThe final nail in the coffin of this once good pharmacy is that a good feature they once had, a charge account, is being limited more and more. Even though I've been someone that has paid their bill every month, even living paycheck to paycheck, barely getting by, I've been told they can no longer go past their ever shrinking \"allowable\" charge with the excuse that some do not pay their bill. I've been going to this pharmacy for 3 years and have been a consistent, reliable customer yet there is no flexibility or caring on their part for my financial situation and the fact that I need the charge account because I barely get by as is, 30-40 dollars (which is what my prescriptions usually come to every month) is a lot of money when you barely scrape by month to month. \n\nEver after calling and talking to an employee there, I was still basically told they will not be flexible even though I stated my next step was to regrettably take my business elsewhere (after paying my balance of $16 and my last remaining prescriptions) which is an indication they apparently no longer want my business, The next step will be to take my prescriptions elsewhere, I may not get a charge account, but when a place is already threatening to cancel it, what is the difference? It is too bad because they have good people working there, but they appear to be losing site of customer needs, especially a customer that has been loyal even with various issues.
