Outstanding Thai food on the East side and at the cheapest prices I've ever seen! Thank you to Yelper Shawn J's review for leading me to gold.\n\nNormally I wait to write a review until after I have at least two dining experiences, but today I can't wait. Zero patience when it comes to spreading the good word about good food.\n\n 5 STAR FLAVOR. $5.50 (Lunch Special Prices) Green Curry Chicken at 10 for heat level. Overall it was some of the best Green Curry I've encountered and the heat level was spot on. Nice balance of white meat chicken to vegetables and loaded with chiles. It's going to be hard for me to try anything else because it was that good.\n\n 5 STAR SERVICE. The lady who helped me gets 5 stars just for her smile. She lit up the small restaurant with her smile and positive attitude.  Her spirit is contagious and I wish my coworkers could be more like her. I had a real funny thing I wrote right here about that, but thought it would be in my best interest to keep it to myself. (That's growth)\n\nWhy only 4 STARS you ask? \n1. Because I've only eaten here once and I am not going to high five a spot until I have tasted more of the menu.\n2. This place is REALLY small. It was clean and bright, but it's just too small. Definitely not first date worthy unless the person is really cool and really loves Thai food and you. Then it would be ideal. \n\nI forgot to mention if you check in on Yelp you get a free Thai Tea if you are dining in. \n\nThai Food To Go is not to be missed. One of the most flavorful, top quality meals around for 5 bucks. I might go back tomorrow to try the Pumpkin Curry on special right now!
