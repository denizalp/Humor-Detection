CUTENESS EXPLOSION.\nBe prepared for teddy bears everywhere!! Teddy Story is the spot for superrr kawaii picz.\n\nPros:\n- New and clean!\n- Huge selection of teddy bears and teddy bear accessories.\n- Drinks made fresh to order.\n- Prices were decent for drinks\/food less than $6, teddy bears start at $30.\n- Not busy, it was completely empty when we entered.\n- I enjoyed their cheese cake and the strawberry smoothie, it was alright.\n\nCons:\n- Tables are small, so you can't play board games or stay too long.\n- It can be eerily quiet at times.\n\nDefinitely recommended! I live in the neighbourhood and really liked it here, but won't be coming back anytime soon...\nIt's a cute and novelty place - great for pictures and special events! They should consider hosting kids birthday parties, tea parties, baby showers, etc.
