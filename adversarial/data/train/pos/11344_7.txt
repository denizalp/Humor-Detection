North Beach Italian Bistro - Las Vegas, NV\n\nShort Review:\nNorth Beach Italian Bistro is a local spot in the Northwest that deserves a lot of praise for their excellent customer service, authentic Italian dishes, huge portions, and great entrée prices.  I'm a fan and couldn't wait to tell friends how good this place is.  \n\nLonger Review:\nNorth Beach Italian Bistro has been around for a couple of years now.  North Beach Italian Bistro shares a building with Bogie's Bar right off Ann Road in the Northwest.  The one thing that I immediately noticed that separates North Beach Italian Bistro from Bogey's Bar is the huge aquarium.  I didn't make reservations, but it's highly recommended since this restaurant is small and can fill up quick.  From start to finish, the overall service was awesome.  Our server gave us her recommendations, some insight on the local's favorites, and warned us that the portions are very generous.  Their small salad and a side of meatballs are big enough to feed two.  I got their Chicken Parmigiana, which is served with mozzarella cheese, Pomodoro sauce, and pasta. Our server wasn't lying about the portions for their entrees. The chicken parm that I got was 3 huge pieces of breaded chicken breast.  The meat was tender and the breading was on point.  My belly was satisfied with one breast, but I couldn't help myself.  I finished the whole thing.  Yes, it was that good.  North Beach Italian Bistro is one of those places where you cannot judge quality and portion size by their prices.  Most of their entrees cost around $15 and you get a lot for your money.  The portions are so big that I left stuffed and my fiancé took home leftovers.  Overall, I highly recommend.  Good Job, North Beach!!!
