This hotel and casino is definitely targeted for locals. The style reminds me of CA's casinos (ie; pechanga) where they have stations in the casinos that offers complimentary refreshments (self served). They also have better perks like if you sign up for their player's card, you get $2 off of their buffet price. \n\nThe interior and exterior of the hotel is clean (better be clean, since it's brand new) and it's very trendy \/ modern.  The slot machines are new, the chairs are comfy - the hotel smells nice; not heavy w\/ smoke. \n\nI have a few complaints about the staffs here. \n1. they're really slow. they take their time to ring you up at the buffet cash register. And there was only ONE cashier for the whole night!! wth?! if you see a long line forming, why not get another person open up another register to make the process go faster?\n\n2. POOR management. My family was there waiting in line for the buffet when the Manager came out and cut my family off and told us to come back at 7pm when the line will die down. He passes out \"150 tickets\" (per manager's words) and tells these 150 group of ppl to come back at 7pm to wait in line again. Now lets think about this for a minute...I get cut off from the original like.. therefore making me the 1st group of the 7pm line, right? But nooooo... it's a first come first serve basis when 7pm comes along.. people who were waiting in line last of the original line may become first people of the new 7pm line. Now tell me if that is fair or not? \nEveryone in the line shared the same view. Now by 7pm, there were mobs of ppl trying to get in line.. and angry guests because they have lost their original spots ... families were yelling at other families because now they're arguing about who was there first or who was standing ahead (original line or the new 7pm line?) \n\nAnd remember, the manager cut my family off first.. hence we should be the first people in line at 7pm right? nope!  other groups were ahead of us! \nThe procedure was poorly executed by the manager. Securities even showed up to break up an argument between two different families. \nSo what does this say? It was suppose to be a nice event for everyone. It was suppose to \"solve\" the long line situation, said the manager. But guess what? It didn't solve anything, instead it created more problems!\n\nI personally wanted to give this place 4 stars but after what I had to go through.. this place gets a 2!  It will have to take me awhile to let myself back to this casino - hopefully better experience. But i would like to stay at this hotel some day.. the pool and rooms look amazing.\n\nmy review for their buffet: http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz\/studio-b-buffet-henderson#hrid:_oYjcS_gJh2UxeFWI443lQ
