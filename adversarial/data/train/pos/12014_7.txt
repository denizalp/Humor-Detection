This is a State-of-the-Art Fry's Marketplace that provides everything you think you might need...and more!  There is a gigantic Kosher foods section titled \"Kosher Experience\", opening Jews and Goyim alike to delicious Israeli and Glatt Kosher foods.\n\nThis Fry's doesn't discriminate.  If you want to be a fatass, you can spend hours shopping at the snacks and soda sections!  If you're passionate about all things organic and vegan and whatnot, it's right in the front so that your anorexic self can prevent yourself from fainting on the journey to the center of the store.  If you live off of TV dinners, this is your place!  If you want a fresh snack to eat, you can get it here too!  Do you like samples?  Fry's will let you sample one of it's weirdo experimental salads (Grape salad??) to try.  Sure they aren't the best, but hey, they're friggin' free samples!\n\nDo you want to buy a whole loaf of bread and don't want to cut it yourself?  They have a BREAD CUTTING MACHINE that you can use!\n\nWhat is amazing about the Shea x Tatum Fry's--a serious gem of a Fry's, an oasis, a beacon of hope--is that the low prices Fry's is well-known for doesn't change one bit! \n\nI can't go to this Fry's without spending at least an hour and a half in there.  It's worth it because you can get gas rewards for shopping there.  The manager's specials actually help you double the points because you're willing to risk your life to buy almost expired food for 1\/3 of the original price.  They reward you for your ability to take risks.  Can I get a hallelujah!???!?!??!\n\nFIVE STARS!!!!!!
