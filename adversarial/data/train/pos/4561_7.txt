OMG... The restaurant that time forgot to renovate. \n\nWhen I was a small boy this was the biggest outing of the year. Did I love going to the Bar B Barn! The chicken, the frizzy fries, that gravy... Whaaaaaat. \n\nWell, 30 years later nothing has changed. The menu, the carpets, tables, plates, decor, even some of the staff is still there. It's sad to see. Someone needs to call \"Kitchen Nightmares\" and beg for help. \n\nI'll always have the memories. :)
