I had a delightful first time official visit at the Early Baker.  We were a large group so they put us In a private dining room.  We felt right at home!  Adam the owner was prompt at taking our food selections and memorized our names (17 of them).  I had their almond croissant once so l knew they had top quality baked goods (a friend brought us their croissants once). Today l had their mango smoothie, it was delicious! Ron had a plain croissant, rich in buttery flavors, big, fluffy and flaky.  In no particular order our group picked French Toasts, Lemon crepes, steak & egg, baked egg dish and a large dish of other pastries.  The big winner is... The Lemon Crepe! Oui, oui. Crepe oozes with a vibrant lemon cream, topped with lemond curd (l think).  Next runner up is the French Toast, a thick homemade brioche smothered in syrup. There were a few Turkish coffees at our table.  It smelled like cardamom and that enticing dark roast Arabica coffee grain. I skipped their coffee today as l had already infused my body with caffeine in the early morning.  The \"steak\" and eggs is in fact a roast beef. One of our friends at the table would not have ordered it knowing this.  I'm confident that Early Baker will edit this erroneous description promptly.\nWe paid for our breakfast at the counter. In return we were handed a card with 20% off at our next visit! I found Early Baker to be an outstanding new addition to Ahwatukee.  I took a look at their showcased pastries (watch my video), and l was very impressed by their pastry chef' skills. It looks like the perfect bakery to order a custom cake for a special event.  We were all very pleased and enthused.  Bravo Early Baker
