Novello Desserts is a small family owned bakeries in Markham area. It is nestled on the side street surrounded by auto body shops and industrial units. \n\nNovello Desserts makes all their offerings in house, that includes gelato, baked goods and hot food. \n\nThe Cappuccino is A-OK.. a strong roast. Tasted great with the little white chocolate nutty cookies I ordered. I told the lady I want my coffee to stay and when I was checking out their cookies, she already made that in a freaking paper cup... sigh.. maybe those mugs are for decoration only?? \n\nDrinking my coffee facing the Gelato is not recommended.. as fending off the temptation of having a gelato right there is not easy....... for $3.75 you will get this big cup, though I stuffed from my lunch and I know I can still eat that with no problem. \n\nThe sandwiches though are not as appetizing as everything is pre made and the server just snap them all together.. but the ciabatta buns they served on looks so good. I just watching a couple wolfed down their veal sandwiches in recorded speed. \n\nThe freezer does have pasta sauce, frozen cakes and other Italian food for purchases. \n\nI guess I have to come back to try their Gelato next time!!
