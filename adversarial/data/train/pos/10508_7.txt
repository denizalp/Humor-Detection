When considering the reviews here you should know that Townsley Portraits offers customers free prints in exchange for a positive review on Yelp.  For anyone who values Yelp and the integrity of user reviews... this is no good.\n\nI probably would've let it go, but I found their service average, including the quality of photos, which is not reflected in the ratings here.  They were pretty rude in all communications, and the process of actually reviewing and ordering photos was bait-and-switch upselling the entire time.   \n\nAlso, you're going to be forced to schedule an hour-long review in person at their apartment, presumably because nobody's figured out how to effectively share photos over the internet.\n\nAnd in case you're enticed by a deal or inexpensive photo shoot, wait til you see the prices for even digital copies of the photos.  Can't find pricing on their website, right?  Right.\n\nAverage photos, outrageous pricing and ordering process, and shady Yelp manipulation.  I have great respect for working artists, but no love for shysters.
