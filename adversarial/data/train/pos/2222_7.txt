Here it is #50! Wooohoooo feels great doing the review on none other than a Gordon Ramsey restaurant. For my 100th I vow it will be Gordon Ramsay steak, but for now...Gordon Ramsay's Burgr. Went to Vegas for the July 4th weekend, something I might not ever do again...wall to wall PEOPLE! So I just had to try it out located in planet Hollywood hotel & casino. It's 114* degrees outside perfect weather for ohh I don't know a giant ice cube strapped to my forehead...but I will settle for a tasty burger & a beer. If you are not a rewards member with the casino you will have to stand in line, took about 20 minutes to be seated. Prices are affected by $1-2 on burgers for not being a rewards member. Great server named Elijah, very attentive, charismatic guy he served us up. I ordered the uber cheese, & me lady ordered the special of that day the \"Gordon Ramsay\". The burgers are very good, hers was a ground pork patty with duck fat bacon & avocado. Mine was montag blue cheese, and I think feta, it was a very good burger and the bun was good too. We ordered a side of fries and a couple beers, I Tried the magic hat never heard of it before, and it was very good. The only downside is I think the burgers should come with they're own side of fries, everything else is spot on. Ambiance,service,food. The chairs at tables do sit a little bit lower than most restaurants but for me it was ok. Please get to Vegas and enjoy a beer & and a burger from Gordon Ramsay's Burgr.
