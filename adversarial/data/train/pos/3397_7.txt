I called this restaurant one time, asked a small question.  My first question was Is the owner there?  Some gentlemen on the phone started screaming at me with verbal abuse and degrogatory comments to me.  I only called there to ask what time they close or are they open late.  The owner I imagine was on the phone and was a complete tool and Pompous Asshole.  Don't bother coming here, I mean if you treat people on the phone like that, I could only imagine how you would talk to your guests in house or your employees!!  Bad owners, bad employees, bad business.  Go to Outback Steakhouse!!  It's better Ribs anyway!!!
