OMG, if there was ever a reason to give a restaurant a perfect 10, then Giada gets it!\n\nTHIS IS MY VEGETARIAN DREAM!  Through all of my travels around the world and back, Giada of the most fantastic restaurants I've ever experienced, hands down.  From ambiance to food to service, no detail has gone unnoticed. \n\nI'll start by saying that this restaurant is a ray of light in the dark underground-esque-walk-through-a-casino restaurant scenes in Vegas.  As soon as you enter the space, you're greeted by the aroma of delicious food, an antipasti bar, a wood burning oven, cooks in the kitchen and food & friendliness all the way round.  It's like walking into Giada's personal kitchen!\n\nThen, after checking in with the host, you'll walk into the dining room to find a GORGEOUS, sexy, ambient-lit space with a killer view of the Bellagio and that part of the strip (mind you, you're several floors up and the restaurant faces the Strip).\n\nYou'll get an interactive cocktail and drink menu, from which I would HIGHLY recommend starting with one of Giada's signature cocktails.  I already forgot what I had, but it's a refreshing summery whisky something.  \n\nOK, now I'm getting onto the food, which is still calling my name days later!  The first and foremost delicious thing:  they start with a freshly baked crucible (?) of focaccia bread, fully loaded on the side with any topping you would need.  For your courses, You gotta go for a little of everything.  It's all meant to be shared.  So I'll ramble off some of what I had...the compilation vegetable plate, flatbreads, a side of potatoes, two types of vegetarian pastas and DESSERTS.  Cookies are a must, especially the lemon Ricotta, one of my fondest memories.  Then try the polenta cake.  It has a delectable strawberry topping with a dollop of cream.  MMMM HMMM.\n\n****FINALLY:  Can I just give a shout-out to my server Nathan and our Sommellier (I forgot her name).  They were just so stellar and they're the kind of people you'd want to invite to your house to have dinner, chat, and treat really well b\/c of how nice they treated you.  REALLY FIRST CLASS!!! *******\n\nI gotta go back to Vegas in a month for round 2 so more to come then...
