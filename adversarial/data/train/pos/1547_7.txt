Dear Brides and Future brides,\nIf you ever dreamed of the day that you get to try on your first wedding dress, do NOT see Carol at Beckers Bridal on the Danforth.\nI had the worst experience of my life. Carol was extremely rude to my family and myself. She yelled at me for taking a dress down to get a better look. The dresses were all squished together and there was no other way to look at them. I tried on a dress I liked and she told me she didn't like it. She yelled at me because I had no idea what style I wanted. How would I know what style looks good when this is my FIRST TIME?? I said I feel bloated and she said \"no one cares if you feel bloated\" I would have cried if I wasn't so in shock by this bitter lady's attitude.\nI would never go back there, and I would never recommend going to her. The only thing I would recommend is for Carol to get a new job and maybe some anger management classes.
