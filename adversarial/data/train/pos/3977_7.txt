Thanks for the great tip Lindsey B. Gwin really does have the best Jesus juice. I do love Alex, Alex, Sean and Bella and we're so happy they decided to open this amazing wine bar (for us ) so close to home. Although they forgot our stockings, we forgive them and still believe they're top notch \nSo, stop by soon and you may just get to meet us #THEOGGWINJESUSJUICEDRINKERS
