Hmmm... I have such mixed feelings about this place. I actually want to say 3.5 stars. I guess I'll get the negatives out of the way since it's quicker.\n1. I don't think this place is a very good value for your money. It's a little on the high side and you don't get that much quantity in my opinion either.\n2. I have no idea what's going on with their website.\n\nThat's it for the negatives.\nThe food was very tasty. I had the beef with salmon bento with fried rice option and I ordered a chicken katsu bento to go. They give you a lot of delicious dipping sauces too which I love. Who doesn't love Garlic Butter anyways? And it was prepared very quickly. The staff is extremely friendly too but I'm beginning to think it's because they are trying to justify their slightly high prices. I was trying to get up to throw away my trash and they all insisted I sit back down so they could throw it away for me.\nThey also explained to me at length (without me asking) the quality of the beef that they use and the different levels they use relative to other places, which is why I believe that they know they are pricey and are trying to justify it to me so I'd come back.\nDefinitely give it a try for yourself at the very least.
