Beware of the deep tissue massage.  My friends and I travelled from San Diego for a girls weekend in sin city.  We decided we'd do the spa stuff off the strip to save some money.  I scheduled a deep tissue massage... and had the strangest massage of my life.  The massage therapist was male, which wouldn't have been a big deal except for his request that I \"get up on my hands and knees\" during the massage.  Keep in mind I just had a sheet draped over me and was only wearing underwear.  Weird!  He also had me start out laying on my side, and at one point massaged my stomach.  I've had quite a few deep tissue massages before and never had experiences like these.  \n\nOn the upside, my friend who had a swedish massage (with a different therapist) said hers was good.  And the lady at the desk was very nice and accomodating while I waited for my appointment.  This is why I rated two stars instead of one.
