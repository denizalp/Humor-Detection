Driving back from CA a guy I was traveling with said we should stop and have supper. We pulled in and noticed right away that the sign over the front of the building stated \"bad food\". Immediately we thought the food must be pretty good to dare put that out front. I had the olive and Swiss cheese burger with onion rings. I don't recall the actual price but it was around $15 I think. It was Thursday night that we stopped. At 4:16am I woke up with screaming diarrhea. How nice being I had to catch a 8 am flight home. Six trips to the airplane restroom and it seems I purged much of the poison they feed me that night. And by 11:30am I was feeling much better. Sunday now and I've lost 7 pounds as my system purges the food poisoning with wonderful diarrhea. Great cheap way to lose weight, have fun!!
