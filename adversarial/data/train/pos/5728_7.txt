Splendid service. Had a pedicure today and loved it. I have pretty rough heels and by the time we were done they were silky-soft. The service was lengthy and pampery. Go late in the day and you will feel like the only human being in the world. And the lady is so nice I've had pie that was less sweet.\n\nThe pedi also smelled delicious. I want to eat my feet. \n\nShe also does eyelash extensions ($3 per fibre), permanent makeup ($?), and eyebrow threading ($20), as well as facials. Recommended by all means.
