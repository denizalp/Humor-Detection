I've been twice and the second visit reinforced the flavorful experience of the first.  In fact, it was probably better the second time.  After hearing a decent amount of buzz about Bachi Burger, the time came to give it a try.  Very tasty and definitely satisfying.\n\nThe first visit I enjoyed a Spicy Miso Burger with a side of the Salt & Pepper Garlic Fries (with Maui onion sea salt and garlic chili aioli).  On the second visit I tried the Ronin Burger and had Just Fries (with sea salt & pineapple ketchup) on the side.  Both burgers were delicious and I can't recommend one over the other, although I think the flavor of the Japanese Cole Slaw on the Ronin makes it my favorite of the two I tried.  My wife had the Myiagi-San's Burger and Just Fries both times.  I loved the garlic fries, but also love the pineapple ketchup that comes with the \"Just Fries\".  I'll face a difficult fry choice next time!\n \nA burger and a side of fries is a very satisfying portion, so unless you have a huge appetite your tummy will be happy with these basics.  If you're at lunch with someone and want the same kind of fries, you may want to consider splitting an order to leave a little room to try something else on the same visit.  Needless to say, there's a lot left for me to explore on the menu:  an assortment of appetizers, Bao sandwiches and salads , and I intend to do it soon.\n\nThis location is in the Village Square shopping center located at the intersection of W. Sahara Ave and Ft. Apache Rd.  Because it's nestled between the Regal Cinemas and Rocket Fiz Las Vegas, there's tons of parking.  Hungry?  Swing in and give this regional chain (with locations in California and here in Nevada) a try.  It's definitely worth checking out the Asian influenced spin on the traditional American hamburger.
