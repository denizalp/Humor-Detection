Low key Larry's Villa is probably the best  strip club in Vegas. Usually there is  no cover, unless  its rented out for the night. It is reasonably priced  for a strip club, but keep in mind that it is a strip club. The girls rock and don't  hassle and haggle  you. Most provide good, quality conversation. To the tourists, this is a local favorite, and the neighborhood is not that bad. There are a lot worse \"hoods\" you can end up at here in Vegas. Of course  there is security if your worried. One last note it is open 24 hours because you can drink or play video poker, but  the girls usually start showing up about 6pm and stay til the money stops. ENJOY a local favorite. Trust me!
