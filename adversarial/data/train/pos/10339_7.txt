Yoooooooo!!!\n\nI'm just going to be real....this place is Fiyaaaaah!!\n\nNext door to costa verde (which is also fiyah) at keele and wilson is Best Kebab & Doner- a Turkish family owned restaurant that is just doing the most amazing things in the north west part of town. The furniture is not all that- but if you see the kitchen- you will realize where most of the money was spent for this operation.\n\nChar grill, Shawarma rottiserie's , stone oven's for turkish pizza's and glass displays for fresh meat. You know that you are getting some quality stuff just from the sight of their kitchen.\n\nMenu was also innovative- a 2 sided laminated sheet with items pictured and description below. It was very easy to pick what you desire- even if you are a novice to the Turkish cuisine. We ordered the Lazelar kebab and also a beef doner dinner.\n\nThe Lazelar dinner was an experience on its own. lamb skewer plated over eggplants and covered with cheese. My brain was amazed and confused. It felt like I had all my favorite things in my mouth. Am I eating BBQ? rack of lamb? Is that Baba Ganoush?? charred meat with melted mozzerala? what? So good....\n\nI cannot take anything away from the beef doner- however I would much prefer it in a sandwich instead of the dinner I got. The doner was a thing of its own. Ever walk in to a shawarma place and debate if you want a gyro or beef shawarma?\n\nsay no more fam- Booom! The doner at best kebab tasted like a combination of the both!! \n\nIm adding this to my top 10 list in this area of Toronto.\n\nI highly recommend it!
