I'm about to drop some fondue knowledge on you AND give Chez Suzette their centennial review? Now that's what I'm talkin' about...\n\nI was all about revisiting this place during my last visit to Old Town, Montreal. I have this on going joke going with my significant other that goes like this \"Have you been there before on a date?\"* The answer is sadly often yes, because we met in our late 20s\/early 30s and are both people that eat out way too often. In whatever city we're in. Anyway, when it was time to play this round I finally got to say \"only with my mom and my best friend's little sister.\" This was bittersweet, as I felt like I won, but then he didn't try to outdo any other scenario. Wow. Talk about TMI. Moving on.\n\nI know this is a creperie, but I disagree. Suzette's finest is her fondue. I've had the original emmental and this time the three cheese and pepper. Delicious. I know others say the prices are jacked up because of this touristy location, but I got a bottle of French merlot (No one is drinking merlot!!! -Sad Paul Giamatti) for under $20 and shared the gooey gooey goodness with my SO. The small is definitely enough to share, and they offer to bring you free bread when you run low. They respect bread to cheese ratios, thus I respect Suzette and her three floors of casual Quebecois dining in the heart of this cobble-stoned hood. \n\n*This game might sound really passive aggressive but it's actually not. It's more like, \"But did she have the bartender send you a flaming shot**? I think not! See I'm the best!\"\n\n**No flaming shots were done at Chez Suzette. She's too classy for that stuff.
