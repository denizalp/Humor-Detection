We took a little vacation over to AZ and this was home base.  We got a killer deal on Expedia and it was a nice stay.\n\nWe were greeted by a friendly lady named Amber who checked us in and told us about all the amenities that comes with our stay.  Free dinner and cocktails between 5-7 M-F.  We didn't partake unfortunately but that sure is a nice thing to offer.  They also offer free breakfast which we did use every single day if not just for coffee and juice.  The food wasn't the best nor did they have the widest selection, but it was free so you cant complain.\n\nThe rooms were nice and spacious.  They had a fridge, dishes etc.  This would be an awesome place for an extended stay.  They had a separate bedroom with a large bath.  The shower was kind of narrow and sloped weird but the rest of the bathroom was nice.  The bed was comfy and they provide you with a shitload of pillows which I love.  The only bad part about the room was the furniture.  The couch wasn't comfy at all, and they had this little old school recliner which wasn't too comfy either.  Dont know what kind of cable they have but it only had about 15-20 channels which was weak.\n\nThe pool area was nice and we swam pretty much every single night.  Only once was someone else out there.  The pool is small, but its perfect because nobody was in it and they always had a stash of clean towels.\n\nThis hotel is located about 5 miles up Scottsdale Blvd from all the hipster hangouts\/bars in downtown Scottsdale.  Free parking too.  And free internet.  Overall it was an awesome stay and I would definitely come back again next time we venture over to AZ.
