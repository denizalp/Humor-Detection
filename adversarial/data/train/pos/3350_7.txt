Does this place deserve a one star? Yes on many levels. Let's start with the price. $32 for dinner on a Monday night. OUCH! I immediately look around to see if it's the decor or view that I am paying for but disappointed to find neither. Keep in mind for this price I expect the quality to be on par with Belagio, Wynn, Rio, and the M. So you think my money MUST go to the food. No such luck as the courses are typical of all the buffets here in Las Vegas, but served colder and under-seasoned.\n\nThe bottom line is don't waste your money and your calories here.
