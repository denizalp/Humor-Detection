I have to up my review of the LVH by one star because they have moved the statue of Elvis back into the entrance of the hotel\/casino near where it used to be for years before they moved it outside.  I always enjoy watching tourists and now it's a bit easier with the statue in casino entrance.\n\nI hope the move was not for the month of August when there's a lot of Elvis interest because of his death in August.  The statue deserves to be in the LVH where he performed so many times.\n\nElvis hasn't left the building!
