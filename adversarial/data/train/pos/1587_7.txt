Never going back. Cashier was very rude. I was next in line and she said I can u-scan. I said I'll just wait. She started scanning my items and throwing across the counter for the other helper to bag. Never greeted us or smiled. She continued taking her frustration out on the groceries. My husband and I walked out and went to another grocery store.
