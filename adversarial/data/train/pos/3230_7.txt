I used to be a huge fan of Mitzi's. Their pancakes rock, or used to. There's been some ownership or staff change (as the waitress explained) and my last two visits have been very disappointing. Not the same Mitzi's. The last time they put sour peach candy on my pancake and black licorice on my friend's. Maybe this was because of Hallowe'en coming, but candy at 8am, not appetizing to all.
