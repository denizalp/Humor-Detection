First off , my husband I and decided to try something new since this restaurant is close proximity to our home. We ordered dinner and wine. The chardonnay tasted like it was purchased t from CVS. Yet, we we charges as though it was a $50.00 bottle of wine..Absolutely, terrible. In fact,  it was recommend by the waitress.In addition every table had a candle and was lite, However, ours was not.. Ummmm Maybe, because we were African American.. Not to mention,the pasta dish with chicken was overcooked and bland...Then to top it off,!!!  Our car was KEYED BY SOME Redneck raciest  bastard!!!! Who does that in this day and age??!! Really, just some jealous idiot!! go get a job and by your own BMW... As for the dinner and drinks it sucked! We should have went  to the Livingroom in Chandler where there are classy people... Instead it costed us $550.00 for dinner!!
