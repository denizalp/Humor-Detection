If you're interested in becoming a gigantic DOUCHE, then this place is your first stop in training.\n\nI understand that everyone has an off-day, but this was so bad I had to warn all.\n\nI wanted to buy a gift for my Dad (a new grandpa), so I went in bright and early one Saturday morning. It was 5 mins before stores opened but many stores at this point had their gates open and were accepting shoppers. I walked into Key Man Engravables two minutes before to browse. \n\nAlthough the lights were on and doors wide open, the manager, we'll call him 'John' said, verbatim:\n\n'We are not open. Leave.'  (Yep, that's what you read.)\n\nI complied and returned a few minutes later because I really wanted this gift. Upon return, 'John' just sat behind the counter reading a magazine even though I made it clear that I was there to buy. Every question was met with disdain and an annoyed sigh.\n\nAlthough he refused to point out items that could be ready the same day, he got mad when I brought over an item that wasn't same-day. \n\nOnce he gave me the order form, he snapped at me for filling out my name and address \"Don't fill that out!! Just the words you want engraved!\". Um, ok...why didn't you say that in the first place? \n\nWhen I asked how things can be positioned on the item, he retorted: \"YOU don't ask the questions, I ask the questions!\".\n\nI was very nice, bordering on pushover up until that last remark. \n\nI explained that I would no longer tolerate his disdainful disposition.\n\nI also suggested he consider a career move from retail to prison guard.
