I was taken by surprise by how great the food was here, and no, it's not just the beer talking!\n\nTruff Diver - mushrooms, arugula, cracked egg, truffle oil - I'm such a sucker for truffle oil and this was perfect on this pizza. \n\nFire burger - pepper jack cheese, roasted jalapeño, red onion, hot aioli. Really enjoyed this burger. Cooked medium as requested and served as ordered and full of flavor!\n\nHatch chili beer - spicy yet refreshing beer. I'm a sucker for spicy beers too, and this one was done really well! \n\nWith food names like \"truff diver\" and \"still jalapeño biznaz,\" I loved their creativity and cleverness. It seldom that I've seen breweries actually combine great beers with satisfying food. I usually just get one or the other but McFate pulls it off wonderfully. There's plenty of space for big groups like ours and our waiter, Garrett, handled our orders like a boss even when splitting checks at the end. I'm recommending this place to everyone!
