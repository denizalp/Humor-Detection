Really cool spot.  I came here for an event, not the normal crowd, but still had an eclectic mix.\n\nFYI:  It is a girl bar\/hookah bar\/dance club.  I never once felt unwelcome, but also I knew just because 2 girls didn't have any dudes around, didn't mean they wanted my company.\n\nThis night they had a dj in the front, a dj in the back, and even fire dancer way out back.  Friggin awesome vibe.  Really hard to explain the crowd, but all friendly.\n\nIf you're a little adventurous or this is already your crowd, definitely stop by sometime.  Although, you may want to see whats going on that night first.
