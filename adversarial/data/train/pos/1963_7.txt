It literally pains me to give a 2 star review but our service the past 4ish times have been utterly unacceptable. We tend to stay clear from the bar because the bartender Rob is such a degenerate mess. He is constantly gambling, slamming the machines, and going on a full roid rage. He's even broken machines before by slamming his fists on them after losing. All while bartending mind you. \n\nSo we choose to sit in the restaurant area. I'm not sure why the waitresses just can't get it together,  but waiting 20+ minutes for a side of BBQ sauce, then another 20+ minutes for our bill is rediculous. Don't even get me started on how long the drinks take.. tonight was an utter disaster. The ending was the cherry on top to a horrible experience  when the waitress disappeared with our credit card. When we couldn't find her I went to a tall blonde waitress and asked if she could possibly locate our credit card so we could leave. Before I even got the chance to finish my sentence she cut me off and said \"do you just want to talk to a manager?\" I said no, I just wanted to pay our bill. She stormed off and we never saw her again. Our waitress eventually came back but this turned into an almost 30 minute ordeal. \n\nLike I said it pains me to give such a bad review, the food is amazing (especially the fish n chips) and they have a great beer selection and we've been going to this bar for years. But the service just can't be tolerated any longer. I really hope this gets noticed by management because I would hate to see this awesome place go under.
