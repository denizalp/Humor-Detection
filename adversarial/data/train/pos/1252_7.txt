So my experience at the SLS LAS VEGAS RESORT. \n\nFirst off the hotel i liked the glowing lights upon the floor as you walk in from the valet, but what do those lights have nothing to do with anything else in the hotel? there is no theme to the hotel. \nThey obviously forgot it was Las Vegas and made it like LA. \n\nthe security wears plaid uniforms... theres ducks and monkeys as there mascots lil animals as decorative stickers on the glass and doors. \n\nNow lets get to the good stuff. \nthere furniture looks like it was from IKEA. \nInstead of putting wall paper they put decorative curtain around the room walls. \n\nThe phones didn't work in the rooms as well as the toilets. \nseems like they tried making this hotel very cheaply. \nbesides all that all weekend all i heard were complaints. \nfrom sitting in the vip to going over to the front desk to waiting for an elevator which made the hotel even more less attractive. \non top of all that. \nthey don't even have good desert for room service. \nthis hotel literally might be worst than flamingo and no offense to them i have never even been there. \ni really wish SLS took more time to figure out what there goal was in making an SLS in vegas because vegas is no joke and this hotel is.
