Oh F*CK yeah!\n\nOkay so Ive had Indian food before.. generally the stuff you can buy at Trader Joe's or make can make at home. However I have never been to an Indian restaurant before.. Ive always wanted to try but the health reports and the chronic cockroach problems always seemed to keep me and the Mr away. \n\nAfter seeing a write up on Chow Bella I decided that I'd take the plunge! It was SO worth the chance.. totally clean, super friendly staff, great drinks and delicious food! We ordered heavy to cross section the menu.. not one dish sucked out of the 7 dishes that we ordered. The rice pudding made certain parts of me stand on end.. it was that good! \n\nI'm very much looking forward to coming here again.. if I were into the ladies I would have buried my face right into the belly dancers boobs.. seemed like the thing to do after a couple of the best long island ice teas!!
