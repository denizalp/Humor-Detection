Wow, the best pulled pork sandwich I have ever had. I had the coleslaw as my side which was better than any other I can remember.     I've heard that the ribs and brisket are very good too.   Reasonable prices during happy hour.\n\nThey have a lounge\/bar\/dance club attached to the dining room and it was much nicer than I expected.  Our server said Tuesdays are their busiest nights in the lounge\/dance club area, (Tuesdays nights WTF?)    Interesting mix of people when I was there on a Wed. night.   Not the Tempe crowd, or Scottsdale crowd, or even the downtown hipster crowd.  It's the METROCENTER crowd which is just a mix of regular city folk.
