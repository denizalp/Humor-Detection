Out in east Mesa you are stuck in a barren desert of chain restaurants and diners that serve the needs of the Octogenarians coming down from the Midwest. Because of these conditions you take what unique and serviceable offerings are out there and you stick to them.  Alessia's is that option for Italian in the area.  The location is the classic strip-mall, something that Arizona has perfected,  and the menu contains the standard Italian dishes from up and down the peninsula.  Solid renditions of the old world originals with not too much in the way of American tampering.
