A great place if you are feeling the urge to splurge on some quality tequilas.  It has a great selection of tequilas and offers unique twists of classics such as grapefruit margueritas and straight tequila liqueurs.\n\nIdeal for smaller groups since the place is a narrow sliver, however the patio in the back gives it a more \"open\" feel.\n\nAlso not the cheapest place so if you plan on partying hard, do some pre-drinking or move on elsewhere to finish the night.
