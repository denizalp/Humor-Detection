It's....real.\n\nReal pizza...in Toronto.\n\nReally.\n\nI...review...food...good...now\n\nOh sorry for the rampant synaptic misfires - my brain had difficulty in processing the fact that my mouth had just ingested REAL PIZZA IN TORONTO.\n\nLibretto makes proper Italian pizza (NEW YORKERS - HEED MY WARNING - NOT THE PIZZA YOU'RE USED TO) in the true Neapolitan tradition.  These crispy, light discs of perfection are swathed in a sweet juicy tomato sauce, genuine Fiore Di Latte mozzarella, and a selection of toppings delivered fresh daily directly from Mount Olympus.\n\nAfter recovering from the shock of the amazing pizza, I returned to sample some of the other fare and was similarly impressed.  Honestly, every single item I've consumed at Libretto has been superb.\n\nThe 3 course lunch set has now been sampled several times...no, not enough to have had EVERY potential combination, but certainly a sufficient reference sample to prove my hypothesis of absolute deliciousness.  \n\nThe lunchtime service was great and it was nice to see the space with, well, some space.  Dinner can be pretty crowded - but that really just adds to the atmosphere.  Ignore any of the whiners and haters - this is the real deal, it's right here, so get going!
