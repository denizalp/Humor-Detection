The problem with this place isn't so much the parking that goes down the middle, it's all the anal drivers that wait for those parking spots.\nIt's the anal drivers that wait, block traffic and bump their music that makes the center drive way a bad idea.\nI personally think the drive way was a nice improvement however, I do understand how loud music can make sitting outside unpleasant. \nWhile everyone complains about the drive way that however isn't my biggest complaint about this out door mall.\nMy biggest complaint is how many people think they own this mall because of their color. I always get looks and bad attitude just because I'm a bit darker than all the pale people that make this location their mall.\nI get these looks in just about every shop I go into.  It's kinda sad that it's still like this, but then again Green Valley is pretty much like that every where u go. Takes some time to get used to. \nIf you don't believe me, Just look at the reviews below and you'll see what I'm talking about.
