So there I was, at home on a Saturday at around 12:30 AM. I see a commercial about a place that will literally deliver a piece of cake to my house and I had to check it out. About half an hour later a guy comes to my door with not only cake but ice cream and milk because Desserts Delivered is clearly ahead of the game. \n\nSeriously good dessert, awesome service, really fast delivery, and a polite delivery guy to boot! \n\nAlso the piece of cake was so big I couldn't eat it all that night so instead I ate it for breakfast because I have no shame.
