I've stayed at the Bellagio more times than I can count & have never had a bad experience. It's in a great location and absolutely beautiful. I prefer staying in the casino tower rather than the spa tower. The rooms are larger & are conveniently  located off the casino floor. The pool is great. They don't cram everyone together like a lot of places. \n\nBe sure to get a M Life card. You get points for gambling & dining at all MGM properties in addition to points for your stay. It won't take long to reach the card level you need for free parking plus you'll get lots of offers for future stays.
