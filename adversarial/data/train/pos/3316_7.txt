We went here just based on the hype around it.  We wanted to go last year and couldn't make it.  We figured going super early in the season would be better, with shorter waits and such.   \n\nWe went on a Sunday night at 8pm.  We bought the tickets with no wait  Got in line, and it looked very short, as it only had one loop around.  This still took almost an hour.\n\nThere were 2 guys walking through the crowd.  The one tall skeleton didn't say much.  He was about 6'6\" and was pretty cool to see.  The shorter guy carrying the wrench was obnoxious.  His idea of scaring people was to come up behind them and scream in their ear.  When we got to the front of the line, he was screaming at my girlfriend over and over.  He reached out and started to rub her hair. I told him that was enough.  He said, \"I am just petting her.\"  I grabbed his arm and told him that was enough.  I was honestly ready to hit him.\n\nThe entire thing takes about 45 minutes to go through.  The skits are pretty cool.  However, it is NOT SCARY at all.  All it amounts to is people coming out from behind doors and screaming at you.  Honestly, I would prefer to see it with the lights on and without the people just to look at the sets.  Again, not scary at all.  \n\nOverall....lame, especially for the price.  I would not recommend and will never return.
