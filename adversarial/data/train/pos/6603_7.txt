Who would've thought you could ever get any dirtier in VEGAS?!?!\n\nIf you plan on spending very little time in your room and will be inebriated to the point of not caring about the cleanliness of your room when you use it, this is not a bad choice.  It was one of the cheapest hotels on the strip and the view from the suites were not terrible. They are pet friendly and they did upgrade us to a suite. \n\nBUT if you look at the pics I (and many others) have posted you'll see how dirty these rooms are.  I found a damn croissant in the corner of my room from the previous guest or possibly even the previous, previous guest (ughhh).  The shower curtain was so moldy I had to keep on asking for more towels since water got on the floor because I showered with the curtain open not wanting the filth to touch my body. I even felt the need to shower with flip flops on because if the shower curtain is that gross who knows how important they think it is to clean the actual tub.  The sink had such a foul smell that I brushed my teeth and washed my face using water from water bottles I bought.  \n\nI was completely grossed out but I could see it working for some people going to Vegas... just make sure you get completely wasted before returning to your room so you don't get disgusted by how dirty things are.
