The Godfather is a great meatball sub.  I was just introduced to it at the Gourmet Food Truck Block Party held at Suncoast.  Two savory meatballs bathed in a rich and mild Marinara Sauce are nestled in a soft 6-inch bun, with Mozzarella Cheese melted over all interior contents.  I just wish this fine sandwich would be bigger, but one can always buy and down two of them.\n\nFrench Fries here are made with frozen skin-on potatoes, but they tasted very good with Heinz Tomato Ketchup drizzled on them.  The ketchup and napkins were thoughtfully provided by a Haulin Balls staffer.  Both the order taker\/money collector and cook were friendly and hospitable.  Ordered food was served up 10 minutes after the order was placed, but this will largely depend on how large the crush of patrons is.\n\nI like food trucks in general, and have very little of a negative nature to say about any of them I have sampled thus far.  But, from now on Haulin Balls and its delicious Godfather will be one of my favorites for mobile vendor comfort food.
