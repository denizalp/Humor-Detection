I will forever lement the loss of those amazing glitter dogs. Do you think they sold them? If you know what happened to them tell me cause I want one. I hated AZ88 for no aparent reason for a long time. I tend to hate things that young hip kids who live in Scottsdale enjoy, just as a rule, so I was sure I would hate this place. I totally didn't. Part of what I loved about it was those ridiculous sparkling dogs though. Seriously the food is super delicious and I always worry myself sick about what to order cause will it be as delicious as Elsa Chicken Sandwhich? Also, how much do you love waffle cut fries? Well I don't know how much you love them, but I love them a lot. And this place is a little classier than Chik-fil-a, the only other place I know that serves waffle cut fries. Even though it is in Scottsdale and hip kids like it, it isn't even retardedly overpriced. You should probably go here if you haven't yet. Those good for check boxes remind me that the Golden Gate cake thing is beyond delicious. Order it.
