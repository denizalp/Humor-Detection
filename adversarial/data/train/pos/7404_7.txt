My wife has seen Dr. Koon Desert West OBGYN for the past 13 yrs as her yearly woman's checkup. He is a good Dr. My Daughters also have seen him since they were of age. Today we called and there was a $47.16 account balance and wouldn't schedule an appt. Until that balanced was paid. I stated it will be paid at time of visit. They said they couldn't do that the balance was to high. So pay the $47.16 or no appointment. The most silliest thing I have heard. I think if they're worried about $47.16 when I also have to pay a $45 copay to see the doctor, then they have more issues at hand than patients care. They will now lose 3 patients who have insurance that they were guaranteed payments from due to an oversight and their policy!
