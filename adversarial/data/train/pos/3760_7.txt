On par with Cocos or Panera.   Some of the reviews of this place are hilarious.   This isn't a Michelin star rated place, guys.   Let's not take ourselves too seriously.  A good alternative to fast food.   Bread is great.  I normally just hit the drive through or pickup our order.  Everyone is always pleasant.  If you want something that is waiting under a heat lamp until you order it, this isn't the place for you.
