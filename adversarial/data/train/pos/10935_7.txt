Me prevouos review about 411 locals was short because I managed to scratch some notes about my experince with them on my mobile phone. However it is not so very convenient to write liong. \nAt home I can do better. \nLet start - they contacted me about 2 years ago. After some phone conversations and email communication I decided to buy a service from them web design and search engine optimization. They compleated the project. With the beggining of 2016 something strange and honestly very scary happened. My website dissapeared from first page, not form the map but form the first page. Being very angry and upset I decided to call them .... just to find that they have no 24hour service and no one is picking the phone durring the weekend.\nNot good and I get even angrier - I am paying my bills every mount and the service I am paying for is ruined.....\nWell, I am sure you can imagene in Monday how the phone call proceeded.. not need to explain to you what an angry and unhappy customer can sounds like. A customer service representative explained me the because of some google updates they are doing additional thing for my website.\n\nI gave them one more 30 days. And ...... they did it they restored the possitioning of my website. \nAs a client I am still not happy because of the missing sufficient service. But will not penalise them in yelp yet.
