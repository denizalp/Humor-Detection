I give it 3 stars for the food and view, but the service wasn't great.  \n\nBartenders and servers were friendly & helpful...once you got their attention.  The staff congregates around the pillar at the center of the bar and are so busy chatting that at least 3 times we had to wave someone down that wasn't around the pillar just to get them to get the bartenders attention.\n\nThe Vietnamese Rolls were crispy with a good amount of spiced meat and the sweet\/lightly spicy dipping sauce.  The Pork Belly Steamed buns were simple and good.  They had the Dr. Loosen Reisling for $35\/bottle.  \n\nThe prices are high for what you are getting, especially when the service is so lackadaisical.  \n\nThe outside area is nice to walk around and see the city and the mountains in the background, but the sofa seating outside isn't facing the view, but rather into the glass doors. If they're open it might be nice otherwise you're just staring into smoked glass.  There are some fireglass pits out there, but again, no seating around them.  Ladies keep those legs together if you're sitting down out there.
