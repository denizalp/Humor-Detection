It's Sunday noon, you're ready to do that long 4 hour drive back home and you're starving. You don't want to spend anymore money especially after a weekend of ASS kicking the casinos gave you. \n\nDon't fret, Sonic Burger will be there to comfort you. Try a double Sonic burger with everything. Or how about a Toaster Chicken sandwich? MMMMMM.......sweet onion rings and nothing like soggy chili fries.  Drown those sorrows with a Strawberry slush. \n\nAs you leave Vegas full, you realized you just gave up your last $20 and you fall into depression again. Raise your fist out your car window and scream: \"I'll be back bitches!\"
