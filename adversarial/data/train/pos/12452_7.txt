This is one of the trashiest Plato's Closets I've been to.  I moved to Chandler from Orlando, where there is a Plato's Closet every 5 miles but now there is only 1 within a 20 mile radius from me.  Next closest one is in Scottsdale. So I am forced to go here.  \n\nIt's dark, cramped, messy and dirty.  There are stains all over the carpet.  Many items are worn and holey.  I avoid going down isles with someone else in them because there is no getting around them.  The isles are so narrow.  \n\nLastly, they need to invest in a whiteboard like all of the other Plato's Closets.  Usually the sales associate will write your name on the board when they are done looking through your items but at this location, they expect you to guess when your items are ready.
