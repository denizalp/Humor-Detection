Went here with Rand H. on there opening day and its OK for a $4.99 buffet. The value is there but it does not measure up to most of the valley Chinese buffets. Some of the dishes were good ,like the crispy fish and some kind of mystery meat that was labeled fried fish but was not fish . Any way not to bad of a buffet for only 5 bucks.
