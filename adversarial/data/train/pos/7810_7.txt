I know, I know--shame on me for going to a chainy, corporate-Irish pub across the street from my hotel.  I was just setting off on a one-mile walk to the Distillery District, when I realized that, after eight hours already that day of tramping around the city, what I really wanted was to sit and drink a beer and read a book.  So that's what I did...for two hours and five beers.  \n\nI had my choice of three adjacent outfits, but I picked MacCool's because of the waitress uniforms.  Go ahead and bash me, but I have a serious weakness for lovely young ladies in plaid skirts and knee socks.  The skirts don't even have to be short (these were respectably above the knee).  Black t-shirts, black knee socks, black\/grey\/white plaid skirts?  Sold.  Okay, okay, I'm ashamed of myself...but not really.  My server \"Sarah\" was beyond adorable.  I just wanted to gobble her up.\n\nSo the beer selection is not stupendous but it serves the purpose, especially in summer (or maybe they're smart enough to be seasonal).  Erdinger and Hoegaarden are both great choices.  I moved on after that to Kilkenny, then Guinness, then a local brew called Alexander Keith.\n\nI can't vouch for the food, but there have to be much better choices in town.  Come for the patio and the skirts, stay for the beer,  The interior is charming too.
