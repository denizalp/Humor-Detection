I am in no way a vegetarian, but occasionally I get that little pang of guilt about eating an animal that probably had a really shitty life. Whenever I get that feeling in my gut, I just head over to the Healthy Butcher and grab my free-range, grain-fed chicken and maybe a couple cold salads, and my guilt is appeased.\n\nMy boyfriend has been loyal to their frozen stock for the past little while -- most recently he used the beef stock to make the most delicious French Onion soup ever, so maybe I can partially attribute the delicious taste to the Healthy Butcher. Although once he got the game stock and it had the most horrible smell to it that we had to dump it down the drain. Yuck.\n\nBesides that one bad experience, every other time at the Healthy Butcher has been pleasant and stress-free. They've got a great assortment of organic milk and other dairy products, as well as some spices and oils and cookbooks in the corner. Prices are what to be expected -- you're not going to get cheap deals like at M&M's or No Frills, but the meat is more humane, so it's up to you if you're willing to pay the extra couple dollars to support the people who kill the happy chickens and cows.
