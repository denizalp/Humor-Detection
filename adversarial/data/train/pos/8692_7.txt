Walked into their store last week and got prices for rims and tires for my 2013 350C Coupe. They quoted me 1,362.47  installed. They told me that they will call me Monday morning in order for me to come in and get them installed. No one called Monday , so i walked in on Tuesday and confirmed the order and told them that i will be coming Wednesday morning to get this done. They wrote down the price and everything and i made sure that this price was the final price. So i went to the bank and pulled out the exact amount. \n\nWalked in Wednesday, and they told me that they would like to settle the invoice after the tires and rims were on the car. I declined and insisted the bill be settled before the job was done. They then told me the price was now $1540. I told them that this was not the original price that was agreed on, they went to explain that the original price did not cover balancing or taxes....... that the price that was given to me was not the final offer and that i was mistaken....\n\nNeedless to say i walked out. Its not because i could not afford the difference its because when someone does not honour their deal and act all shady i will walk and find some place else who is honest and i am willing to pay more for honesty and a piece of mind. \n\nJust wanted to give anyone who is going there to make sure that the price their getting is ACTUALLY the price.
