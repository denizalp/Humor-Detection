Absolute garbage. I ordered the 3 meat combo, which consisted of pulled pork, brisket, and pulled chicken. Where to start. Let's see, the pulled pork tasted like taco meat. Looked like chewed up baby food, and tasted like taco meat. The brisket: cut into teeny tiny little pieces with no flavor. The chicken: Not too bad, pretty decent flavor, but a little dry. \n\nSides were cornbread, beans and potato salad. Corn bread was dry and hard as a brick, potato salad was ok. Mayo based, big chunks of potato. Beans were nasty. All I smelled and tasted were onions. Need more flavor and probably cook the onions first.\n\nNow to the good part: It's called Ric's SMOKEhouse. Where's the smoker? Nothing I ate was smoked. Walk in to the place and I dare you to smell smoke. You won't. As for the fresh bread? I don't know, maybe. I sure as heck couldn't smell anything baking. \n\nBottom line: Worst $15.38 I ever spent. I threw out all of the meat, beans and cornbread. Ate a few bites of potato salad. Spend your money on better food folks. If you are craving BBQ, there are better places out there.\n\nLook here on Yelp, you'll find them.
