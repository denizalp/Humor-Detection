As you can tell from my profile, I'm not one to write a bad review - if you don't have something nice to say...But I can't stop myself from sharing my experience at Quiessence - especially when considering the price.\n\nOn our anniversary, I thought it would be great to take her to a high-end spot like Quiessence.  I looked at the reviews (first time social media has let me down), it looked legit, and I set it up without telling her.  I made a reservation, let them know it was our anniversary asking for a nice table and offering to pay a little more if there was something special they could do.  For our near $300, here's what \"special\" means:\n\n- A table by the door. I seriously can't believe they cram a table there, everyone who walked in was basically on our lap.\n- After taking our drink order, it took 20 minutes before our waiter returned, and with just one of the drinks.\n- We ordered, received our appetizers in ok time, and then waited another 40 minutes until our meals began coming out (we ordered special courses - big mistake)\n- Each dish came out somewhere between warm to cold, for sure sitting around\n-  Even if warm, the quality was not anywhere near the caliber of what a similarly priced meal at any other high-end establishment around town would be.\n- Tip was included in the bill at over 18%\n\nSeriously, unreal, when expressing our disappointment, we received a \"sorry.\"  Even if it was an off night, there's just too much here to ignore. SAVE YOUR MONEY AND GO SOMEWHERE ELSE!
