Things you will need for this hike:\n\n- strong legs\n- strong arms\n- strong will\n- strong lungs\n- strong joints\n- shoes with good grip\n- probably gloves too\n\nThis climb is no joke. It's a \"short\" hike but don't get fooled; it's a workout. I'm an active person, fairly in shape. It didn't kill me, but it challenged me, which I loved it. Honestly, more than the level of difficulty, what scared me the most was the actual fear of falling. Some parts are literally lose rocks over lose rocks and the climb is so steep that if you slip and fall, you die. \n\nParking as everyone mentions is small. I went there at 9am on a Tuesday and had many options but it's easy to see how on weekends that could turn into hell. Do yourself a favor and catch a Uber. Well, as the saying goes, great things require work and this climb is as amazingly beautiful as it's hard. And yes, you read it right, this is NOT a hike. This is a CLIMB. You will use your hands almost as often as you will use your feet, I promise you. This is NOT a climb for kids or dogs. You WILL do bear crawling several times and you will feel muscles you didn't even know it existed in your body the next day.\n\nBut man, what a view! Great views all along the way, not just at the top. I'm so happy I did it and I'll keep doing it on a weekly basis because this is better than any gym.\n\nI finished the round trip in 1 hour and 45 minutes. But I didn't stop much along the way.\n\nGoing down can be just as challenging as going up, again, it's steep, and it's all lose rocks.\n\nWorth it tho. So worth it.
