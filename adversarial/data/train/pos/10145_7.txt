Pretty cool little place. They make your little pizza and throw it in the oven, all the while you can watch through the glass dividers, so of course you have your face pressed up against it and slobber everywhere and hover over the chefs. Which is a plus! It's like subway, except not depressingly dissatisfying. \nThe pizza is super delicious, and it's very quicky in and out, so perfect if you're in a hurry. \nThe only thing I have to whine about it the price. I mean, the gelato is pretty freakin good, but not $3-a-scoop good. A fountain drink is $2.50, so it's best if you hover around for awhile and keep getting refills to get our money's worth.\nSo if you're a hoverer and like to hover, this is the place for you! Get in your hovercraft and stop by this newish pizza place.
