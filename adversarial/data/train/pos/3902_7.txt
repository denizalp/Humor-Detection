Hubby and I are fans of Burger Priest because sometimes we like to indulge in a good burger, fries and a shake. Don't come here if you have health issues or are counting calories though; this is a place to have a major cheat meal. Maybe you'd feel better if you knew that their beef is free range, grass fed and ground in house daily.\n\nOUR GO TOS:\n- FIERY FURNACE Bacon cheeseburger with crushed hot peppers with added \"smoke\" (breaded deep fried jalape√±os). Not that spicy but flavorful.\n- THE PRIEST Cheeseburger with a portobello mushroom cap that's panko crusted, stuffed with cheese and deep fried. \n\nTried their Riggs and Murtaugh (vanilla ice cream with chocolate milk) shake which was thick and yummy!\n\nCombos come with their fresh cut fries and pop (they have Dr Pepper, plus points for this)\n\nWhen you venture further out of Downtown you gain elbow room and lines shorten. Staff are helpful and friendly. Located by the outlets on Orfus Road, it's a perfect place to grab a bite to eat after a round of shopping.\n\nINTERESTING FACTS: The founder had aspirations of being a pastor but things didn't quite work out they way that he wanted. As far as the name of the restaurant \"the restaurant name is actually Protestant in inspiration, based on the idea that anyone, anywhere can bring the sacred into the mundane.\" - excerpt from website.
