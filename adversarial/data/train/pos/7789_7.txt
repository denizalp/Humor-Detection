Owner seemed nice enough, if a bit smarmy\/haughty. I sold him a couple of records. Since there was no one else in on that saturday afternoon I had his full attention, so he gave me a run down on my records. Apparently 10\" jazz isn't worth much, nor are 78s, so I didn't bother showing him my Elvis, or Buddy Holly ones; I just threw them out since they're not worth anything.\n\nThe problem was, he gave me this rigmarole about fairest prices in the city and said no one pays better than him, but when I went to Grasshopper records just up the street I saw the same album he paid me $5, going for $75. \n\nsurely he could have given me a bit more than 1\/15th of the retail value on it. \n\nI won't be back, I'll be going to quixotic sounds, or Grasshopper.
