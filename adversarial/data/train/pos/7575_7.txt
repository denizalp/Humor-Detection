YOU MUST READ THIS! Cover: $45 (Price As Expected )it is because the dancers were pretty hot. Some busted ones but most were top shelf bodies with some exotic and homegrown beauties. You gotta pick just one to be honest and work that one. 2 if your pockets are deep. 3 if you're ballin! \n\nNow let's get to what is important. First: buying rounds with a credit card or debit? Huge mistake!!!! DO NOT DO IT! I repeat, don't open a tab. Your CC will get flagged for suspicious activity. They bang your card for every round. YES! Every round. Use a back up and the same thing will happen. Use a debit and you will have to use your PIN! It's 2016 but this club still has to collect money first so really it's \"fuck the patron, pay us!\" which I get but man Sapphire is one dirty run business. \n\nNext!!!!!! The ATM fees are sneaky. If you don't read the fees you're a dumb ass. Keep your purchase receipts and dispute the shit out of each transaction but don't throw away that receipt. HINT: the machine increments are in $20 so you should know the fees aren't fixed (they charge 15%).  I dropped $600 cash in ATM withdrawals in 4 transactions and they did not add up. The fees varied from $10-15. Then you will get an additional $2.50 fee from your bank. I was far from drunk with those little thimble ass examples of \"French Connections\" drinks. My dancer was a bad ass European chick so I just kept at it. I decided to go 30 min with 4 drinks in the VIP room and had to do a finger print, PIN number, Xerox ID, signature and LITERALLY that was the only  transaction that matched my actual purchase & receipt. \n\nLong and short, pay the dancers cash. Don't let the club take you for your loot. Don't have cash? Stay the fuck away! City of Lost Wages indeed!!!!
