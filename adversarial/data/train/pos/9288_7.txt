I have visited Harley's on two occasions and I was fairly impressed. Now, I know I'm spoiled because I've had some of the greatest Italian on earth, but Harley's is certainly a competitor. \n\nMy first visit, I had the tortellini with sausage. I wasn't thrilled with the Alfredo sauce that it came with. I wished for a little garlic or a bit of flavor in the otherwise plain Alfredo sauce. Overall, my food was ok, but I have had better. \n\nThe second trip was far more impressive and delicious. I had the gnocchi with a Rosa sauce (red sauce with cream) and a side of meatballs. The sauce was VERY good and flavorful. The gnocchi, again, not the best I've had, but pretty darn yummy! The meatballs were good, but I was disappointed to note that they were cold in the middle. That told me that they make their meatballs ahead and then refrigerate them, which made me question the freshness. On the upside, the meatballs were flavorful and well seasoned. \n\nI would definitely visit Harley's again and try their other offerings! The service is great and food prices are cheap and the meal is a-ok!
