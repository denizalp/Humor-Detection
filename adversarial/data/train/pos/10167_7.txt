How I ended up at The Markham Station Restaurant?\n\nNothing is open on a Sunday before 7 AM for breakfast!! I called Eggsmart....Cora's... nothing is open aside from The Markham Station.. but they never really close anyway??\n\n$4.99 All the Breakfast cheap...but not the breakfast I would like to have often.. maybe I might go to MacDonald instead.... yes it was that bad!!\n\nSausages dripping in oil... I guess they deep fried them?? When I bite into one.. the oil just dripping everywhere.... The roasted potato though reminds me of potato boiled with tomato paste....which my friend enjoyed.. \n\nOnly 2 free refills for coffee ($2) and minimum charge is $3 per person.. as I can imagine some customers might hang out for hours and try drinking free refills of coffee the whole day.\n\nServices here are lacking, the waitress were all so laidback..and has this 70s small town vibes, which definitely match the atmosphere of the place!\n\nWill I come back?? Probably not? BTW, there is a McDonalds that opens 24 hours just up the street.. just saying....\n\nFYI: CP 24 is ON!
