This has absolutely nothing to do with bad service, or even expectations about the food. It's a Denny's. \n\nHad a work breakfast meeting here last month. \n\nCase of the Mondays, meet MSG induced food poisoning. Can you guess where this review is going?\n\nMy boss got pretty sick. So did my coworker. Who knows how many others did. I know I did. Blowing out both ends . . . Ain't nobody got time for that! \n\nNever again!
