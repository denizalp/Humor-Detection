If there wasn't people in the room I would pick up this bowl and lick it. This place puts out European level Crepes. Seriously. I am already trying to plan my week to come back for bfast again. Holy S$&@. \nThe helpful cashier handed me some granola to try (she could see I was new) and it started there. \nWow\nWow\nWow
