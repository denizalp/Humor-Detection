Go somewhere else....anywhere other than Chandler Regional ER\n\nI had abdomnial pain and went to the ER because it was not something that could be diagnosed at an Urgent Care. I received a CT scan after several hours, which I understand is standard. They do nothing to make the ER a comfortable place and franklly seeing people in distress sitting in chairs in a waiting area or hallway doesn't build any confidence. \n\nOnce I was in the 3 person waiting area for testing, things did not improve. One person next to me had so much perfume on I started coughing which was horrid with my abdominal pain. The nurse didnt properly seat my IV for the contrast, the tech was unhappy about it when I went in for the CT and he warned me to let him know if I began to feel pain or numbness in that arm (great). The contrast worked in the IV, they took my images and took me back to the waiting area. A doc came in and told me I had an appendicitis and they were calling the surgeon. The doc said he would return and never did and a surgeon never showed up. I asked to see a copy of my CT report, which seemed to surprise the nurse but he did follow through and show me the report,  and it mentioned a gallbladder that I DONT have. How can you have any confidence in a hospital when they make decisions on such shoddy reporting?\n\nThe visit continued to be awful. I was in the telemetry unit...there are 3 walls and a communal bathroom. I could hear everything my very loud next door neighbor and his family said - there is No Way that affords HIPAA protection. Not to mention it made sleeping or resting next to impossible. No wonder they give you eye covers and ear plugs!\n\nNeedless to say, I did everything in my power to get out of that heinous place masquerading as a hospital. I contracted a virus while there...shock of shocks.\n\nThen came the battle of the bills...sadly health insurance isn't like a credit card, you can't dispute it with your carrier so the charlatans don't get paid!!
