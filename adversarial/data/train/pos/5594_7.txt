It was kind of hard to find a place that seemed appealing to us and open on a Saturday afternoon in down town.  We actually walked by here twice before we decided to come in.  So glad we did!  Easily the best restaurant we went to in our short stay in Cleveland.  I love Indian food and Desi really surprised me.  On the weekends they have a buffet setup for lunch.  It's not large, but I promise you everything is going to taste amazing.  There was maybe 12 items and every single one actually tasted fresh like it came straight from the kitchen.  The chicken in both the biryani and the tandoori were one of the most tender and juicy I've had in a long time.  The goat curry was falling off the bone tender, another rare finding at a buffet.  The butter chicken actually tasted like butter.  Even the raita tasted better than most restaurants I've been to.  The fried items were still crunchy and the rice was pillowy soft.  Loved it!  But what I loved the most was that the level of spice was really perfect.  Not hot enough to where you're begging for water, but hot enough to clear out your sinuses.  And when we sat down, the owner brought a fresh basket of straight from the oven naan, dripping with butter.  Crusty bottom, soft inside and oh so good.  Definitely worth stopping in for!  You really can't beat that for $10.  Honestly this little place was better than 95% of Indian restaurants in Chicago.\n\nThey've only been open for two weeks or so.  Show the new Indian joint some love, peeps.
