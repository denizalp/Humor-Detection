First of all... WHY THE CRAP WAS IT SO COLD IN THERE? Even my poor little Yelp hoodie couldn't keep me warm. I ordered soup just to keep me warm and that did not work. Perhaps that is because the soup was made out of a melted salt lick. \n\n\nThey did gave me a free cookie and have 3 different types of iced tea. The bathroom was very clean. Free internet rocks \n\nBut if you intend to eat here bring a snow suit. Or possibly a snow suit, pile of blankets, ear muffs and a space heater.\n\nAnd don't order the soup.
