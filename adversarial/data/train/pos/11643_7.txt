This is one neat place when considering a pool!  They have approximately 8 to 10 in ground pools of varying styles, sizes, and amenities to view.  It is a great opportunity to visualize pools and different colors of tile and pebble tech.  In addition, we were able to sit down with a pool designer as a walk-in on a Sunday.  Very informative trip and well worth the drive for anyone considering a pool!
