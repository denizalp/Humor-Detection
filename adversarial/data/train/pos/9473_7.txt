This place is a sensory sensation!  Its Adventure playground is MEDIUM SIZED (but expensive at 16 bucks per kid.)\n\nThe arcade has Skee Ball which works out to 55 cents a game if you load your card with the $50 best value option.  There are other games, like networked arcade Mario Kart, too.\n\nFish and Chips are tasty.  Most meals are around 8 bucks.\n\nAnd I hear they sell groceries too!
