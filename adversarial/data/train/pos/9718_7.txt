THIS REVIEW IS TOTALLY BASED ON HOW THIS STORE DOES SHOE RELEASES. \n\n\nIt's a first come first serve basis which sounds like if you get there early you have a real good chance  of getting the shoe.  That is partially true after experiencing it first hand camping out for the Jordan 11 playoffs.  The better way to describe it is.. who ever is the first 5 in line will get a shoe along with all their homies that they let cut.  There is no security guard or employee regulating the line.  Even when people from the back would tell the cutters to get to the back, they come up with some excuse saying that they've been there for a long time already or their spot was being saved.  It is pretty obvious and unfair after you see groups of people jump in front of you after you've been waiting for hours.  \n\nThis shoe store is not your Footlocker, Finish Line, Nike store, or Champs. They won't receive close to the amount the bigger shoe store will get.  I think they only had maybe 15 (or less) Jordan 11's today.  When we first got there, there was less than 20 people in front of us.  30 minutes before they opened the door, there was maybe 30-40 in front of us.  \n\nThat will be my last time camping out for a shoe here.  Your odds are better of dealing with the raffles or purchasing the shoes online when they release.
