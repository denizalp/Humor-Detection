Here's the thing folks, like with so many personal beautification services, there is a rapport you must have with the person who is working on you. Whether that be aesthetician, make-up artist, hair dresser, manicurist, or tattoo\/body piercer.\n\nI find with that latter it takes a couple of meetings to get to know your tattoo or body piercer well enough to build a rapport. Such was my experience at the Dawn of Evel where I had the pleasure of getting to know shop owner Evelyne and her staff!!\n\nThese shops typically have a reputation of employing staff that can \"appear\" hard on the outside, BUT after countless times chatting with the staff at TDOE, I feel like I'm walking into a friends place to hang out! Honestly such nice people!\n\nThat being said, let's get down to the details here. Dawn Of Evel is slightly hidden as it is a basement level studio located on the south-east corner of Lakeshore and Mohawk. They've got several artists and piercing specialists on staff and from the work I've seen in each of their portfolios - it's amazing (especially Evel, that woman can ink!!)\n\nThey jumped into the Passport to Port Credit promotion and offered piercings for a steal ($20 a pop) so I decided if anything was getting done anywhere it was here - I felt totally comfortable here. Rolled in today, at my appointment time and was walked through all the things I needed to know, should expect and had my sketchy nerves laughed at (which helped surprisingly since I was being such a wimp).\n\nAfter a short while I was taken in back and within moments, BOOM, I've got some new metal to show off (located on my delicate little schnozz). \n\nI sit here, nose still a touch sore, but man does it look cool! Like I feel like I did when I was 16 and sneakily got my nipple and cartilage done - such a rebel!\n\nI'm thrilled with the work that was done and the post piercing care explanations and when I decide to get my next piece of ink done, it will ONLY be with Evel and only at this shop!\n\nThanks all!
