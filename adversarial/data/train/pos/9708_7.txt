Winterlicious Review\n****\n\nThis was my one and only Winterlicious booking in 2015, and the only reason for it is that my friends were meeting up as a group for dinner already, so we thought we'd try a Winterlicious menu. I'm always hesitant with Winter\/Summerlicous because I know the service can be severely misrepresented...but I thought I'd give it a shot.\n\nCon:\nThe table. The actual table. The entire side on my end was that flap of the table, and it led to a knife and spoon to slide off, and us unable to put any sort of weight on the side. Kinda odd.\n\nCon:\nWe were a group of 7 (diners, not artists). My bf couldn't make the 6:30 reservation because work got busy, so I asked the server to remove one of the place settings, since we were 1 person down. But when everyone else arrived, I realized one of us had called ahead already to make the change in numbers, so asked for it back, and was met with some attitude. \n\nCon: \nWe weren't given a wine menu, so we had to specifically ask for it. The server also said \"I assume it's wine by the glass?\" well, no....We're ordering by the bottle, but thanks for that assumption! We had to pick the wine 3 times, because the first two were unavailable. Tsk tsk.\n\nCon: \nWhen ordering, everyone thought the first dessert listed was the best sounding one, but the server informed us that it was already sold out. It was 7pm only, at that point. I thought that was pretty poor preparation on their part. To their credit, they did come back with a substitute option, but it was a far cry from what was on the menu. \n\nPro\/Pro\/Con:\nI ordered the BRESAOLA, which was Smoked Cured Beef with Arugula & Grana-Padano Cheese for starter - nice presentation, good flavours. For entree, I had Papperadelle Con Anatra, Wide Egg Noodles with Duck Confit. Another delicious dish! Presentation was just ok, but definitely well done. Dessert was the biscotti, which was the poorest presentation of dessert I've ever seen. Literally 3 biscotti sitting on a plate. ALSO, my friends who ordered the striploin were not given an option for doneness - medium well for all!\n\nTo their credit, the service improved throughout the meal - perhaps our server got a bit of a talking to? She was a lot more pleasant and helpful later on, and was perfectly nice while helping our group take a picture. \n\nOverall - the service in the beginning left a bit of a sour note. It's the Winterlicious service, I'm telling ya! The food itself was actually a 3.5\/4 rating, except for the dessert. I really don't think the service is representative of the normal dinner service, but unfortunately, that's the experience I had.
