This was an awesome time! Dodgeball, volleyball, foam pits, free bounce and basketball are among the different activities at Sky Zone. The staff were great, there was a mix up with my times and the staff really went out of their way to ensure that we got the full hour we paid for, thanks so much Sky Zone. \nThe prices are reasonable and the fun is unlimited! Give it a try if you wanna do something new and oh, the workout you will have!
