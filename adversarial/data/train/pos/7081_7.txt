Marshall Park is an urban park.  There's a man-made lake with a cement bottom, a large grassy area that ends at McDowell Street and a smaller grassy area on the other side of the lake.\n\nThere's a fountain as the centerpiece and the concrete in front of the fountain is often used for festival stages.  The viewing area is on a hill which has 3 concrete levels for people to sit and view anything going on below.\n\nIt is a good park for a small festival or for an afternoon picnic on the grass.  Just watch out for the geese!  During mating season they are mean and that doesn't include the poop.
