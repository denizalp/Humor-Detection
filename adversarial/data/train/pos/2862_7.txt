I arrived to see 1\/2 the Veal Cutlet Panini leftover on my Plastic Tray.  I told my Friend I would arrive within 10 minutes and to go ahead and order!  I never expected within that time that the Panini would be ordered + prepared + EATEN.\n\nLesson: Never tell my Friend to order first!  She makes it all disappear!\n\nA few other Panini Shops in the Woodbridge\/Maple area are made to order.  Although that means the WAITING time increases, it makes for a better Panini especially if you order anything that needs to stay crisp such as a Veal Cutlet which is my standard comparison for Panini Shops.\n\nNo surprises here.  A regular Veal Cutlet Panini($6.15) and standard to most Panini places, some toppings are additional but my \"Friend\" got the Medium Hot Peppers so I wasn't able to taste their Marinara Sauce as-is.  Even at that it still seems like your run-of-the mill Sandwich that you can enjoy while watching CP24.
