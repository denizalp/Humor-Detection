Yeah...I'm not really excited about this place. In fact, I doubt I'd come back. My experience wasn't horrible, but I've definitely had better. Much better. \n\nFirst of all, the decor in this place is pretty hideous. The purple booths are forever ingrained in my mind. I'm not sure who thought that was a good idea. The restaurant is huge so I guess that's good news if you want to come here with a large group...I doubt they ever have much of a wait, but I'm really not sure. Second of all, my friends and I didn't exactly have the greatest service. Don't get me wrong, our server was plenty nice and very patient, he just had difficulty keeping up with us and forgot things throughout the meal. It seemed like he may have been new to the position and just became too overwhelmed. And of course, I have to discuss the food. I ordered a pollo fundido type dish and it was decent. It certainly didn't look very appetizing...the cheese on top looked greasy and plasticky, but it actually tasted okay. I've had better pollo fundido elsewhere, but my biggest issue was really its overall appearance.\n\nSo yeah, I'm not really feeling this place. We're in Arizona for goodness sakes...there are so many delicious Mexican restaurants nearby and unfortunately, Los Olivos just doesn't compare to so many others. Thanks, but no thanks.
