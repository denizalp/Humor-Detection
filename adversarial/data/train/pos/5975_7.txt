Bottom line; this pool sucks.\n\nIt's easier to get over just how much it sucks if you're drunk, but getting a buzz going at The Beach is going to cost you.  Their drink prices are ridiculous, even for a Vegas pool. \nThe whole place is just dirty, and the pool chairs look very old.  It gets so crowded that some people can't even get a pool chair, and just lay in the dirty sand instead.   It's impossible to get a cocktail server's attention, because there aren't nearly enough of them there.\nAlso, whoever's picking their music needs to get fired.  Who plays slow, depressing songs from the 70's at a pool!?
