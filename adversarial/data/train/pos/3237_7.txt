Great place to get rims and tires. \n\nRent N Roll is the Rent A Center of custom wheels. They have locations all over the country. This location is across the street from Golden Corral. You can rent rims and tires instead of out right buying them. I guess people do that now? Wheel rentals are either 52, 65, 78 or 104 weekly payments. They offer free installation, free flat repair, free rotate & balance and free locks & lugs. \n\nYou can just buy rims and tires too. The showroom is clean and spacious with lots of different brands and sizes all the way up to 30\". When you go ask for Danny. He will take care of you. \n\nI went to get my brake calipers repainted and they did a great job!
