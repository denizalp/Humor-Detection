Hello Auntie! Its like being invited by your cool Korean Aunts that prepared a delicious meal out of fresh ingredients. I first came across this family owned restaurant by chance with my sisters. We were formally greeted in Korean (-Hello)! Seated immediately with water and menus. One of the nice lady ask if it was our first time. She went over the Menu with us and explained about how they make everything out of scratch and recommended that we order their Mandu-Korean dumplings. Wow! The dumplings were simply delicious and consistent with flavors without being too soggy. They are available in 2 versions: Pan fried or Steamed. Both are delicious and great for sharing. Another item that stood out for us was the Kimchi Fried Rice, prepared just right without being overcook. The dish was seasoned and balanced with a good amount of heat. All meals are served with Banchan-side dishes. Each side dish was on point and lived up to being fresh and homemade. My sisters and I have been regulars here and never had any issues. Its been our to go place whenever we are craving for delicious Korean food.\n\nPro Tip:\n-This establishment is NOT an AYCE Korean BBQ.\n-Traditional Korean food in a casual family setting.\n\n2017 Yelp Review #41
