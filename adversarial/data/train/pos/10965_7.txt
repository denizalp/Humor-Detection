we came here once for happy hour sitting at the bar and enjoyed some chicken wings and potato skins, and a couple beers for a pretty good price.  wings and skins were 5 bucks each with the half off deal, which in my opinion is what they should cost normally.   both were tasty appetizers.  i do want to try the fried pickles.\n\nwe also came for dinner and actually sat down in the restaurant.  we had a $25 gift certificate from restaurant.com which always helps and we love to use when we come to vegas.  unfortunately our server was terrible.  he seemed really really flaky.  like someone found him off the street that day and said want to be a waiter and he said sure i got some time to kill.  in all honesty we were tempted not to use the gift certificate because we did not like the fact he was automatically going to get 18% tip because he didnt deserve that much.  but anyways the ribs i had were actually really good.  i love ribs, i get picky on them especially sauce, but it really came together well, and i would highly endorse ordering the ribs.  the prices are high of course, but we should know that when entering most strip restaurants.  \n\nif you want to eat a sitdown meal make sure to purchase the gift certificate during an 80% off promotion and get 25 bucks off for $2, otherwise i would stick to happy hour for economical sense.  ill probably end up making a point to make it a happy hour trip when im staying down towards that end of the strip.
