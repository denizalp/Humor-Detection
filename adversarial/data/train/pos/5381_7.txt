One night my friends and I were trolling Fremont St. when someone got a hankerin' for some breakfast.  After the Las Vegas Club disappointed us with closing its coffee shop early and thereby denying us the steak and egg fantasy we longed for, we ended up at Tiffany's.  Quite the brush with serendipity as I don't think I would have done so otherwise.\n\nI've seen this place for years.  Sitting across from the Olympic Garden in the White Cross Drugs, it used to be the Liberty Diner.  This is an honest to god drug store diner and it couldn't be any more awesome.  If you're looking for something sparkly, this is not your place.  But if you want a plate of eggs and bacon (maybe some pancakes, eh?) and a good cup of coffee, come on in.  I've not tried their lunch or dinner yet, but you can bet I'll be returning.\n\nThe best thing is, if you do happen to get indigestion, you can pick up some antacids at the same time.  How's that for convenience?
