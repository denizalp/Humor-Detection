* Good BBQ *\n\nAfter an incredibly disappointing BBQ plate at Palomino Smokehouse (http:\/\/www.yelp.ca\/biz\/the-palomino-smokehouse-calgary#hrid:ZQaY2hv7M8T7O0q_lWTHJg) I needed to try and have the Calgary BBQ scene redeem itself.  Enter Holy Smoke.  \n\nI ordered the brisket sandwich with a side of ribs for a total price of $8.99.  Hooray for normally priced BBQ.  But I would have been willing to pay more as the quality was very good.  \n\nHere is the tray:  http:\/\/www.yelp.ca\/biz_photos\/holy-smoke-bbq-calgary?select=vzG3OIgMs1a9CjJj0CW6Xg#vzG3OIgMs1a9CjJj0CW6Xg\n\nThe brisket was properly smoked, and very tender.  I personally prefer sliced brisket over pulled, but that is a regional difference.  The taste was spot on.

Good natural smoke flavour with properly rendered fat.  Excellent job on these.  They charge $1 a bone, but threw in an extra one for free.

Too bad it is in Alberta instead of here.  Perhaps they could expand??!?!?!?  (Hint hint, nudge, nudge)
