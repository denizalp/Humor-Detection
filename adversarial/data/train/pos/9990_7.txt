This place is so neat. I met a friend here for coffee and it took me some time to find it as I was in the shopping center south of here. There is a small fountain and lake next to this shop and it creates a serene and laid back environment.\n\nI ordered an iced latte with almond milk and caramel syrup and it was enjoyable, lots of caffeine of course but I drank it slow. I loved their outdoor patio, the weather was perfect and the seating comfortable. They do have food items but I didn't try any this time, maybe during my next visit.
