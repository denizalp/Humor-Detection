This was my favorite club of all time until tonight. We got bottle service for the night. 1k bottle service for a table outdoor. Our friends went to the restroom and they won't let them back into the VIP section of the outdoor section. (They got kicked out of the club.) the rest of us left and waited right outside of XS and trying to call our friends. The purple suit guys (the hotel security) told us \"you guys need to clear the place!!\" Wow really?? The place was empty and we were not blocking the way. It's not what you say, it's how you say it. \n\nMy friends are cops and we aren't trouble makers. We are just waiting for our friends and waiting in one spot so we won't get lost. The manager security of the hotel decided to be \"big man on campus\" told us we need to leave because we are trespassing. Like really? Trespassing? Should of told us in the beginning before you charge us 1k for the table. We were not blocking the exit at all. The security manager ask for my friend's ID. And he gave him the cop ID and he didn't even know what to do with it.  \n\nFor a high end club and hotel they couldn't filter out the guys that's trying to think they are \"big man on campus\". Being rude to people that doesn't cause trouble and not understanding the situation is never Ok. You cause yourself and the hotel drama that doesn't need to in the first place. \nThey totally had bad judgment. \n\nIt's sad when they don't know how to hire people with good customer service. \"Big man on campus\" attitude don't work in the customer service field.\n\nVisited (Monday night 3\/21\/2016)
