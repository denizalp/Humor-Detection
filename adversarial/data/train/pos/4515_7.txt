I wanted to love this place. It took several visits to actually find them open, and it seems their hours and menu have changed a lot over time. 8AM is a little late to open a coffee shop if you're hoping to grab neighborhood business, and I would think closing on a Sunday would cost them business from people exploring the cute downtown area.\n\nThey focus mostly on beverages, with some limited grab and go food items and pastries. Menu had wraps listed as \"coming soon\", but I saw no mention of the breakfast quiches and sandwiches mentioned in other reviews. \n\nThe coffee I got was decent- they have a few unexpected flavors for your latte, like mint, which is seasonal elsewhere. I don't know if they were out of nonfat milk when I went, or if they don't stock it, but they do have soy and almond available? \n\nIf you go in the late afternoon, they discount their pastries: cupcakes were BOGO when I went. The pina-colada flavor stuck to the wrapper and didn't wow, but the classic red velvet was well done and disappeared quickly. \n\nService was friendly. Space is large for groups, quiet for studying, and has a lending library available on site, which I thought was a great touch. Though it's on Water Street, it's not a particularly high-traffic area so it seems this spot is still fighting to stay open and find it's niche in the community.
