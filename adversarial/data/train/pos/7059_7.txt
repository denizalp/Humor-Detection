Las Vegas (LAS) McCarran International Airport has been nicely expanded, designed and renovated over the years. I arrived LAS to Delta's Terminal D. Delta does not have a Sky Club here, but, United Airlines President's club, which I am also a member is conveniently located near my arrival Gate D36 so I stopped in for some snacks and drinks. \n\nUpon my return to LAS at around 5:00am to return home (EWR) I found the UA club was already opened and operating with coffee and breakfast snacks so I was happy. The club had a nice selection of magazines, which I greatly appreciated. And then off to my 6:35am flight again at Gate D36 to EWR via SLC.\n\nLAS also features a very nice effective mono-rail between the main terminal and the sub terminals.\n\nThe baggage claim area is also quite large, but, effective.
