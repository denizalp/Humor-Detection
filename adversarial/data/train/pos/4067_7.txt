My first impression - \"Is this a strip club?\" The first thing I saw when I walked in Surrender was a bunch of stripper poles and gogo dancers dancing with dollar bills in their panties. Was totally NOT expecting that! \n\nI'm not sure what it is but this club was completely dead on a Saturday night. The promoters told me it would be crowded so they even convinced me to buy presale for my bf, even though when we showed up it was comped admission for both guys and girls and there was absolutely NO line at midnight.\n\nAfter checking out Light, the atmosphere at Surrender was definitely different. They played more hip hop than anything. Also, the LED wall and sound system was unimpressive compared to Light. I did like that there was more room to dance and the outdoor area provided a nice escape when my feet started hurting. They even have blackjack tables in the outdoor area for those who want to continue gambling in the club. I also loved that they gave out the colored LED tube thingys. That kept everyone entertained on the dance floor since we thought of some creative things to do with them.
