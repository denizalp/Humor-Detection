After a day playing in the snow up north and drinking coffee most of day, I needed something different to wake me up.  The location is so convenience, easy access off of the I-17 and next to Harkins Theater. \n\nIf it wasn't so cold outside, I would want to try their snow fluff.  I ended ordering just a hot basic milk tea.  The hot milk tea was decent but was on the sweeter side for me. I believe it was the owner that indicated no boba can be added with hot drink. If you want boba, stick with the cold drink. \n\nThumbs up for the friendly staff, clean restroom, and clean tables.\n\nThumbs down for lack of snack food items on the menu.
