The waiter second guessed my order because I was white and asked if I was sure I knew what Chirashi was. Excuse me I've been to Asia more times than I've done acid and learned to use chopsticks as a teenager in old Hong Kong. Also, my dinner was supposed to include the standard Miso and Typical Sushi Salad with Orange Coloured Dressing. I GOT NO SALAD!! Anddd they did not offer me a miso soup until after I was finished my damn main course!\n\nAND TO TOP IT OFF THE WASHROOMS WERE FILTHY. THE LIGHT DID NOT WORK SO I HAD TO LEAVE THE DOOR AJAR. THEN WHEN I REACHED FOR THE TOILET PAPER THERE WAS NONE AND I HAD TO HOVER IN THE DARK TO GRAB PAPER TOWEL.\n\nAnd then I am expected to return to my Okcupid date and pretend everything is going on as normal as it should be ?!
