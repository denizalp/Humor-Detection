I was in the area and I had skipped breakfast so I went in to grab an early lunch. I ordered what I normally order at the Courtney Park Osmow's (chicken shawarma pita with no olives or hot peppers) and today I opted for a \"little - one line\" of hot sauce since I wanted to take it easy on my empty stomach. But my hot sauce preference varies from medium to little depending on how I feel on the day.\n\nI don't know why I bothered asking for my toppings. It's like they took one look at me and thought, \"Yeah, we're giving her the white person special\". The toppings on my wrap were tomatoes, onions, lettuce, very light garlic sauce and no hot sauce - none. WTF! I could have gotten this chicken wrap from any place. This was not a Lebanese wrap. Where are my pickled turnips (which frankly is the best topping!), where's my garlicky garlic sauce, where's my damn hot sauce!\n\nDon't give me what you think I can handle. Give me what I goddamned ordered. And I was the only one in the restaurant at the time so they didn't confuse my order with some Becky's order. I was truly annoyed. It was so bland. So bland. I guess just as they assume we white people like. Well, Osmow dudes, I'm white and I didn't like your bland \"white person special.\"\n\nNeedless to say, I'm not coming back to this location. I'll stick with Courtney Park where the pickled turnips and hot sauce are plentiful.
