Stopped by for some ramen in the Valley...was pleasantly surprised about quality of ramen here!! Noodles were solid and very good consistency and miso and spicy ramen were both fantastic!! Think the miso ramen was the best ramen on the menu!! It was flavored perfectly!! The spicy is good but maybe Just a touch too spicy to fully enjoy...The age tofu was pretty good but not traditional way...octopus salad was excellent!! Drinks are nicely priced!! Overall excellent spot!! Will come back!!
