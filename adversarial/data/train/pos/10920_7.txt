Carnival World Buffet....\n\nIt lives up to the name, there is just about every category of food available at this buffet. I cant even name them all! \n\nChinese, Japanese, Vietnamese, American, Mexican, Italian, the list goes on and on and on! \n\nJust like your typical buffet, prepare to walk through the whole buffet line just to check out what it is they have to offer here. This place suits just about every nationality's needs if you limit yourself to certain foods like my dad does. He prefers Chinese food over all, so I would take him here if I was ever with him in Vegas. \n\nSeriously, if only my gf can find me the picture of me along with the 10 plates of food on the table that I just finished while holding my belly as if I was pregnant! \n\nI love food, and if you want to try out some ethnic foods, no better place to check it out, then here at Carnival World Buffet.
