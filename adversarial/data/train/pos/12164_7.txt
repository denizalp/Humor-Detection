Can a baguette change the course of your life forever? Maybe. \n\nWill Local Loaf's baguette give you an epiphany about how bread should taste? Definitely. \n\nParked in Fran's old spot in the 7th Street Public Market, Local Loaf is bringing artisan bread and sandwiches to the masses. \n\nI stopped by today to purchased a baguette and spoke with Adam, proprietor and chef. Oh holy goodness. \n\nI was going to wait until I got home to tear in and experience the crusty, fresh perfection. But the Mr stopped by and ripped off a hunk of the end. \n\nI'm glad he did, because we quickly enjoyed the crusty, chewy, fresh-from-the-oven taste and texture in its purest form, unadulterated and delicious. \n\nI guess I should stop gushing and just tell you to make haste and visit Local Loaf. Today. Or tomorrow at the very latest.
