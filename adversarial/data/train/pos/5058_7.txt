I loved Shake Shack in NY.\n\nThis one in  Las Vegas is just as good at the NY NY Hotel.\n\nI stopped for lunch and ordered the usual....Shake Shack Double Burger with Cheese Fries!\n\nAnother satisfied meal...no BJ needed until tomorrow night....\n\nThe Burger and Fries were so freaking yummy!  The Burger is THE BEST!\n\nThe Beef is so HUGE and SO GOOOOOOD!\n\nU must try a Shake Shack Burger either here or in NY!
