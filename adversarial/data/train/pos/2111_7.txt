There is nothing like delicious authentic Italian food and throughout the US, there is an abundant of family owned Italian restaurant. In this day and age, restaurant chains are a powerhouse in the United States. Olive Garden is no exception as it's one of the most popular chains with locations everywhere. Most of us are accustomed to their salads and breadsticks which is probably one of their main draw. Another, main reason is the value since most Americans are used to having larger portions at a reasonable price. My family and I, occasionally will crave Olive Garden or for the sake of just having Americanized Italian food. My parents are from the Philippines and Italian food is usually consumed by the wealthier citizens in the country. However, it's pretty much a middle class staple here in the States, LoL.\n\nThey have decent food and most times I do enjoy my order but this particular visit we had the privilege to be served by Luis, who was simply amazing. From the beginning to the end of our most recent visit was fantastic. Considering that it was a busy night and the staff seemed overwhelmed. He made sure we were ok and everything came out in a timely manner plus the food was hot and fresh which in most cases chain restaurants tend to forget. We will be back and will request Luis to be our server!\n\n2017 Yelp Review #77
