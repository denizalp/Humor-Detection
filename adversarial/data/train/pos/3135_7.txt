I swung by Super Burrito after I dropped the baby off at daycare this morning.  Figured I'd try a chorizo and egg burrito.  While it was greasy, I didnt think it was SO greasy that it would trigger a Non-Gallbladder attack.  I was wrong.  So. Very. Wrong.  \n\nIf I'm ever in the need of a full colon-cleansing, I'll return to Super Burrito.
