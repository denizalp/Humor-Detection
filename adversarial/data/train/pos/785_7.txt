SkinnyFats? Doesn't that cancel each other out? Anyways, I was in the area so I decided to stop by and see what they're all about since I seem to see everybody check in there almost every other day.\n\nFirst of all the place is kind of a bit hard to find. It's located in a suite amongst other industrial businesses in a pretty large sized business complex. Typically not a setting you find a popular caf√© in. Parking can get frustrating as well since you have so many other suites that equals to not a lot of parking. \n\nWhen you come in, you will see that there is only one register and I would say about 7 to 8 medium tables. If you don't see a line going out the door, then you got lucky and just avoided the lunch\/dinner rush. If you do get stuck in the rush, you better have a decent amount of time allotted not to have anywhere to go any time soon. Remember, you waiting in line, putting your order in, and waiting for your food to come put together equals a lot of patience because all those people that ordered ahead of you are in the same boat. So it takes time for you to get your food since everything is made from scratch.\n\nWith that said, I ordered the Burger Benedict, which has a half pound angus beef patty, lettuce, tomato, pickles, avocado, fried egg, and special SkinnyFats sauce. It was also accompanied by a side of truffle fries, which was a large enough portion to share with another. The fries were good with the two different flavored ketchups that were available on the tables which were Balsamic Vinegar and Jalapeno (refer to my pic).\n\nAll in all, what I had was very good. Its just the parking, location, and long wait that brought it down to a 3 star. I think a bigger place and more accessible location with a couple more registers would make it perfect. \n\nSidenote: They have free wifi. Domain is skinnyfats. Password is eatskinnyfats2.
