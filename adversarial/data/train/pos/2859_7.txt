I stopped in for a quick dessert before going to a show at Las Vegas Little Theatre in Chinatown.  I saw ice cream on a sign in the window and I went in for that.  I made my way to the area where the ice cream was and saw that they made ice cream sandwiches.  Pick your cookie flavor, then your ice cream flavor, and last one of the staff makes the ice cream cookie sandwich.\n\nI went back to the ordering area and it turned out that my first choice of cookie was not in stock.  Neither was the second choice.  (I got these choices from their sign).  The order taker went back and checked the cookie boxes and came back and told me what WAS available.  I went with the white chocolate chip cookie.  I got this with cookies and cream ice cream which I knew they had because I had seen it.\n\nThere was a bit of a wait because the boba orders were ahead of me and they were somewhat busy.  In due time, a gentleman came back and opened a new box of white chocolate chip cookies and removed two.  He then used a two-piece plastic gadget to make the ice cream sandwich.  First, he put a piece of plastic on top of one of the cookies and pressed really hard.  This plastic had a raised portion and it was in here that he scooped the ice cream.  Then the second cookie was placed on top and another piece of plastic was used to push very hard on the cookie to press the ice cream into the perfect sandwich shape it is.\n\nThe ice cream sandwich was placed in a paper holder and given to me.  The cookies must be specially made for this purpose because they were as hard as rocks.  They would have to be to survive the pressure placed on them by the person making the sandwich.  Optional dental coverage should be available!  The ice cream was regular C & C which was the best part of the sandwich.  \n\nI was less than pleased with my ice cream sandwich.  I'd been better off buying one in the freezer section of the nearby market.
