During the week, full of  the usual delinquents - pretty much exactly where you want to be after realizing how many years you spent in Vegas. \n\nOn the weekends, a trendy crowd full of UNLV students with fixie bikes. My point is there's really no way of knowing who you're going to meet. \n\nThe bartenders are excellent (except bill, he's kind of a dick and won't stop talking about the glory days back on the island - hope you like living in a landlocked state and watching surf videos). \n\nMegan is fabulous - super sweet chick that pours a strong drink. Pint sized but has a bigger set of balls than most of her male bartender coworkers. \n\nThe manager and the owner are both cool - recently making trips to improve the place. As to jazz up this local hole in the wall, keeping it's years of history preserved. \n\nAll in all, drinks are cheap, machines hit all day long,  and not a lick of judgement. (On sundays feel free to wear your pajamas in the morning.... I know I do),\n\nIn summary, great place to get hammered with friends. and f*ck, fun to get hammered with enemies too.
