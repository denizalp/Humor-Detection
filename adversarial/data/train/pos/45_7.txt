Awful! They stole my phone charger out of my car while I got an inspection. When I went back inside and simply asked if it had fallen out of the car, the guy who I suspected of taking told me they don't steal out of cars. He seemingly admitting guilt when I was implying it was only lost. Then he described the cord as a white iPhone charger but then said that he didn't see anything like that in my car. I'm outraged and will be contacting management!
