Yonge and Eglinton doesn't seem to offer much as far as falafel and shawarma is concerned but I finally found a place that has and does an amazing job with it. Cafe Gelato is located a bit north of Eglinton on Yonge and is right by the Capitol Event Theatre.\n\nJeff, the owner, makes almost everything from scratch from the marinating and cooking to the meat for the shawarma, putting together the ingredients for the falafel, and making the hummus and sauces.\n\nI also enjoy the BBQ chicken that he makes. Jeff takes pride in the marination process which includes saffron. This is not your typical BBQ chicken that's roasted and slathered in BBQ sauce, it is on a different level! It's actually my favourite sandwich there! (A must try)\n\nNow I've talked a lot about the sandwiches (also offered in meal plates) but there's a reason why the place is called \"Cafe Gelato\" and do I really need to say why?\n\nYes... In case you didn't guess, the place serves homemade gelato too!  I've only tried a couple of flavours and it's a welcome dessert to have after your sandwich.\n\nI will say that the place is small, has limited seating and does get a lunch rush but there's plenty of street benches you can sit if you aren't able to grab a spot inside.
