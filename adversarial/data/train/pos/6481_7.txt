My hair & makeup was the worst part of my wedding when it was supposed to be the best part that I was looking forward to...eye makeup made me look like my eyes were closed in EVERY single pictures we took because she put eyelashes too low, I told her I need to go darker than my normal skin tone since my body is darker but, my face was so white compared to my shoulders in pictures which I worried about and my hair was flat on top (the picture I showed her had perfectly round foof romantic half up) bottom curls were gone by 9pm (my wedding was still going on til midnight) when they arrived at hotel they didn't even introduce themselves to me n we just started getting ready right away I thought it was kinda rude even though they \"tried\" to have a small talk later on...I paid about $1,000.00 for 4 of us (1 was hair only) which all my friends think they totally ripped me off...did not remind me they accept cash only until it was time for them to leave then she said it was on the contract (I signed that contract like 4months ago and I was dealing with 8 different vendors at the same time do u really think I had time to go over or remember everybody's contract how they wanna get paid???) and plus I like having some type of copy of all the payments I made for the wedding anyway so, I ended up writing check...I solely picked them over \"yelp\" reviews from others but, wish I had enough time or extra money to do trials with other companies before made a choice cz every vendors play huge part in wedding...
