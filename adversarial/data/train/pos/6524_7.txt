JUST CALL NOW TO MAKE APPT. YOU WON'T REGRET IT!!  Stormi is a nail artist not just a technician. Look no further for high quality product and precise technique. Too many nail shops are full of rude, impatient, wanna be nail techs just trying to get you in and out. Stormi uses hard gel instead of acrylic..I was skeptical at first, but am now obsessed. It's strong and better for your natural nail.. also she drills it off rather than soak and scrape. I literally went 6 weeks before I got a fill and was still receiving compliments. She charges a little more, but you get what you pay for. So if you want to pay less and have a broken nail or chipped gel within a week..don't come here.  I am so happy I found Stormi which was through Yelp, so I hope my review will help others.
