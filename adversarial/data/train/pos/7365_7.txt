I gave this place a chance and was disappointed. My nail tech was just drama central. Telling me how the other girls hate her and how her husband has baby mama drama. You think after my \"yeah ok\" and \"sure\" she would get the hint I didn't want to hear it. My nails after two times of asking her to straiten them looked like a monsoon hit them. She kept saying it was my nails. Yet my new salon worked two hours on fixing her damage. They are now perfectly strait. Will not be returning. My best friend also will not return after they shredded her nails when she had them removed. Only reason I didn't give one star is for manager. He always fit me in last min.
