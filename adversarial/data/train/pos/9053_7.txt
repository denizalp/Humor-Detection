L'Opera Patisserie and Cafe is a nice little cafe along Yonge Street. \n\nNice and dark at the back of the cafe.. even in the afternoon so I guess you can take your date for a small romantic quickie doesn't matter when :P \n\nThe barista working alone here is a nice Asian man, since he is working alone, it took awhile to get our beverages. \n\nLove the mug it was served in... ceramic dark blue with golden patterns... and the spoon has this little X'mas theme. The cappuccino is not the best but the effort he put it makes it A-OK. \n\nI really doubt that the pastries and macarons are made in house... but they were displayed nicely in the cabinet... Even the macarons are all prepackaged individually or 6 in a bundle... and really they do look similar to the one at Tokyo Bakery.. but more pricey :)
