Still full of Awesomeness...no matter which waffle I try I have yet to be disappointed.  And you can get anything you want gluten free and vegan.\n\nOn this particular visit 3-7-16 I believe one of the owners was in the store because the staff was not as warm and friendly as in the past.  There was a totally different vibe in here then in the past 3 or 4 visits.\n\nNot sure what was going on but the food was still amazing, the drinks were amazing and this is a place I not only highly recommend but will come back to as well.\n\nTo me this is one of those places you just cannot seem to get enough of.  You can get breakfast or lunch stuff anytime and you always leave satisfied.
