Fat Choy is the prototypical old school Vegas diner hole-in-the-wall, but with an Asian twist. It's the type of place you want to go after a night of gambling and drinking. Regardless of if you've had a great night, or a downer of an evening, you can also end it right with a pork belly bao, or a juicy burger. \n\nAs I've been a huge fan of Chef Su of Flock & Fowl fame, I had to try his original brick-and-mortar spot. They have a bunch of bao offerings including the pork belly, peking duck, and tofu and mushroom for you vegetarians. Unlike Momofuku, you get way more bang for your buck with two baos per order. The peking duck bao had great flavor. And you can't beat that crispy duck skin.\n\nAs for the sandwiches, I couldn't pass up trying the shortrib grilled cheese sandwich. The onion jam with both provolone and cheddar melded so well with the short rib. Tomato dip included because it's a grilled cheese after all. Very reminiscent of the best grilled cheese you've had from your school cafeteria, but elevated.\n\nMy fianc√© tried the duck rice, which should more aptly be renamed duck and rice. I think we were both expecting a roasted duck fried rice, but it was more so a duck leg with rice. The duck itself was sort of bland, and I didn't care too much for the spring salad. After you get past the ginger scallion sauce, the dish mostly lacked flavor. \n\nLove the concept of of this place. You can also take a look at their mural which shows the timeline and history of their restaurants.
