Well I can say I am a frequent diner and very happy to say I will continue to eat here again. For a while I had been passing by now wishing i would have taken a chance on dropping in sooner. Groupon is what sold me. I got a killer meal deal which drove me to come in. I am surprised by the reviews as I have not had anything but great experience every time I have visit this location along with quality food. I don't eat Shrimp or Lamb so my reviews are on everything else. The meat is seasoned very well. The salad is amazing. It is not your typical mixed green salad they actually make it pretty loading it with the color veggies that make a mixed green salad taste well. I typically just eat there Champagne Vinegarate but they offer many other salad dressings. Along with the grilled tomato and pita bread make the meal even more enjoyable. \n\nMy last order was #19 the Chicken Kaboob Meal. This was Grilled Chicken, Rice, Salad, Pita Bread and a Grilled Tomato. Everything was perfect. Fresh flavorful and hot. They cook everything to order so be prepared to wait at least 15 mins but it is worth it for good food.\n\nAll the staff on deck are welcoming. It is a small little place with plenty of seating. Stop on in grab a drink and be prepared to enjoy.
