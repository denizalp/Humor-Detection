2 cents Tuesdays. Need I say more?\n\n4 stars because you get what you pay for.  This place was perfect because: 1) I'm not picky; 2) it's cheap; 3) it's centrally located on the strip; 4) they allow dogs; and 5) I won money.\n\nI think a lot of people failed to evaluate their priorities before they decided to stay here.  Were they expecting a Venetian quality stay for the amount they were paying? Again, read the first line.\n\nThe resort fee includes WiFi so I was able to get some work done.  The room was clean  and I didn't see any roaches. Sure there were some stains on the carpet and chairs, and sure it was loud as hell being right in front of the strip above Margaritaville, sure they decided to shut off the elevator located conveniently next to my room, sure they overcharged my credit card but later refunded it back after some effort, but hey, the room served its purpose.\n\nOn a side note, the sandwich trick worked here. Yes, I used the sandwich trick, here.
