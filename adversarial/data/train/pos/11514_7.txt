I can't even say anything about the food because I couldn't even get in the place. Pizza + beer + TVs for games + a bar...sounds and looks like a sports bar to me.\n\nIt was a Sunday and this area of Scottsdale was booming with football fans. All I wanted to do is get some pizza and beer before a show at Livewire next door. I never made it in, though--I got stopped at the front for wearing Jordan shoes. Even though girls there were wearing basic sandals and guys wearing what I could describe as flat skate shoes. Okay, so I guess this place is a club.\n\nNext time I will wear a suit with coat-tails, top hat, and a monical.  Wait, no I won't because I won't ever try to get in this place again.
