On a scale of 1-5, the food quality was at best 3.5 stars out of 5. I'm rounding it up to 4 stars because of their top-notch customer service. As times goes on, maybe I'll update the review in the event their food quality and taste become more memorable.\n\nLocated off the strip, the restaurant sits near Chinatown in Las Vegas and just recently opened. \n\nI ordered the Dry Noodle Soup the first time I went and wasn't too impressed. It didn't really have much flavor and oh my god... It had a pretty crappy portion size. The waiter came back to ask for feedback and I gladly told them the same thing. Usually for my dry noodle pho, the portion sizes should be identical, if not the same as the soup version. The serving size was at best 1\/2-2\/3 my expectations.\n\nI tried the egg rolls and they weren't too bad.\n\nI decided to check out this place again and went the next day ordering Combination Pho (with soup this time). The portions were better, but the soup was bland. My friends  ordered the Oxtail Pho and it was really good and tender. I highly recommend ordering that one. \n\nTL;DR: Very clean pho restaurant (which is a PLUS) with a good amount of options. I wouldn't mind going back! The servers left a great impression too.
