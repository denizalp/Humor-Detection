Eh, I'm neither here nor there with this place. Although the food and service did not blow me away or make a lasting impression, I will say that the ambiance and atmosphere is lively and fun. \n\nSingle ladies *side note* if you're looking for a MAN this would be the place to go, it's like a MAN cave in there! Lots of MEN Haha. Well in all seriousness we came here for a going away get-together a group about 7 to 10 people.\n\n We sat outside and loved the feel of it next to the fire pits they had. Almost everyone of us ordered drinks and either an appetizer of some sort or entr√©e and shared so when I say the food was just \"ok\" my credibility comes from that of being able to taste plenty of dishes. \n\nOur server was not the most friendly but not the worst either, but I'd imagine working at an upbeat trendy place like Distill She'd have a bit more of an outgoing personality or serve up at least a few smiles here and there but no luck. All in all a great place to grab drinks and have a good time with friends but not the first place I'd choose to satisfy any cravings but in the end it is called \"Distill-a Local Bar\" rather than \"Distill, a five star restaurant.\"
