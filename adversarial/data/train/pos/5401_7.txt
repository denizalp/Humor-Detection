The ambiance was disappointing, and the food was way overpriced. All of the promotions and photos indicate this would be a cozy restaurant with ample decor to support their \"sense of old community and public house vibe\", but this \"public tavern\" image certainly isn't what you get. There are white walls with a few collections of framed pictures. It reminded me of a Bar Rescue makeover, but Jon Taffer would certainly be impressed with the volume of business... it's like there isn't enough game in town.\n\nThe \"happy hour\" cocktails were essentially half-size, which negates the point of \"happy hour\" pricing. Even more disappointing, the cocktails weren't mixed. You could see the layer of liquor through the glass. Don't get me started on the $20 Chilean Crab Cakes that had a funky texture.
