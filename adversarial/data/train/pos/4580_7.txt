Best of both worlds!  Looking for a place to stay while in Vegas without all the noise, without the long valet wait, without the inconvenience of lugging your luggage across a busy casino, and without the stench of smoke?  Then Marriot's Grand Chateau is your place.   \n\nBut there's more. \n-The Grand Chateau is basically a condo or nice sized apartment located right off Las Vegas Blvd and Harmon. \n-The rooms are spacious and clean\n-Hotel is quiet.  It wasn't fully booked, but it also wasn't completely dead either.  I saw a lot of people entering in and out of here. So my guess, this is just one of those hotels that offers peace and quiet. \n-Full size kitchen with a dining area\n-Living room\n-Decent views of the strip\n-Nice lobby with a great staff at your beck\/call\n-Pool tables at the lobby\n-Cafe that serves sandwiches, Starbucks, and even gelato\n-Fitness Room.  \n\nBeing a resident of Las Vegas, it's easy to take the strip for granted.  Don't get me wrong, I avoid the strip at all cost to avoid the crazy \"Vegas Baby\" crowds.  Staying here, you'll forget that you're on the strip, but at the same time, get to enjoy what the strip has to offer.  We took advantage of our stay here and played tourist the night we had a room.  We walked the strip at night, did some shopping, visited a friend, and then the next morning went for run.  I had a great time and am sure it was due to my company and comfortable night.  This hotel has a lot to offer and even though we didn't take advantage of everything that a staycation is all about, I can say one thing...the Marriot Grand Chateau is a nice place to sleep at.\n\n\nYELP PERSONAL CHALLENGE 2013 - (498\/500)
