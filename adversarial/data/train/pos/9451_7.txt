When my honey decided he wanted to spend his birthday in Sin City...one of the places he said \"he always wanted to go\" is a costume party. Not just any costume party but a Fetish and Fantasy party. After procrastinating on buying tickets, I finally booked it and trust me I should have booked it the moment we decided we were going. After two weeks the price went up by $20, yup the cost for tickets are $100 each. A little pricy.\n\nNow we had to figure out our costume. We decided to go as the \"Johnny Depp\" Mad Hatter and Alice. Let's just say it was a hit. I made my honey's costume and did his make-up. We decided to just buy my costume online, which was ok but came in way too big.\n\nOnce we arrived, we got a wrist band and it's a one-time entry, once you leave the place you can't come back. Unless you bought VIP tickets which is like $200-$300 each, yup think not. We'll let's just say the costumes here, were very interesting. You name it, it was here. From sexy, raunchy, cute and scary. There is no nudity allowed at this party. So ladies and gents had to cover up their private areas, but that doesn't include the butt cheeks, because they were everywhere you turn.\n\nThe place was sectioned by 4 different rooms. We were only allowed to go into 3. The two rooms seem the same, just decorated different and all 3 played the same Techno music the entire night. I think I had a headache at the end. One of the rooms they had a BDSM station. Where people actually stood in line to get wiped, chained and all that other stuff you do. Trust me that line was long!! I guess people love that kinda stuff. I'm all for it, but heck do it in the privacy of your own home peeps. \n\nI did win a free bottle service and VIP upgrade at Larry Flint's Hustler Club for spinning the wheel. I guess it was a big deal because people were cheering and they said I was lucky to get it on my first try. Did I use it? Nope, we were already leaving the next day. Oh well!!\n\nThey also sold wipes, chains, lubricants, dildos and etc...you name the sexual accessories they had it, heck you can even order a bed that has chains attached to it. *SMH*.\n\nOverall the party was cool. It was fun to get dressed up. I was not a fan of the music, but meeting new people made up for it.\n\nAlthough I have tons of pictures, I would love to upload, unfortunately Yelp will not allow it. Total Bummer!! I guess you'll have to improvise.
