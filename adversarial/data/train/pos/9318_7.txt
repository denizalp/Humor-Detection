Didn't get my fix like everyone else.\n\nWhile driving by, my tummy encouraged me to stop by to fuel the soul. It was pretty busy too which made me even more eager to try their food. I ordered two Pastor tacos and one Carne Asada Burrito with beans and guac which came out to about $20. Yes, the tacos were bigger but the meat came out dry, tough, and were not seasoned well. My Asada Burrito was even more disappointing as I found out majority of it was guac and beans along with about 10 pieces of meat. Quality wise, I was only impressed with their tortillas to be honest.\n\nBack to El Gordo and Don Tortaco I go.
