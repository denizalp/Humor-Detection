Oh.  My.  God.  Yes.\n\nYou want lean meat?  F*ck you.  Don't clog up the line.  \n\nYou want your meat nice and buttery with tender melting fat, that has been smoked and seasoned, sliced by hand, and delivered to you on a platter with a stack of rye bread?  Come.  Come fast.  Come often.\n\nI was here twice in a three day trip to Montreal.  Get the large platter.  Get it half medium, half fatty.  Do it.  Live a little.  Get yourself a pickle and some cole slaw, the vinegar helps to cut the fat.  Get a black cherry soda, the bubbles and sugar help cut the fat and salt.  \n\nJust watch your waiters.  Mine was rude and terrible.  I was told by a Canadian friend, that I just received an authentic montreal experience.  But my waiter got everything wrong.  He brought me lean meat, and I wanted to stab him with a fork.  Luckily, he came back promptly with fatty meat.  \n\nBut you can't fault a place with such an incredible product like Schwartz's Smoked Meat on the basis of bad service.  You can't even fault them for being in Canada.  You can be resentful we don't have them in NY.  But we have good things in NY too.  Just sadly no Schwartz's\n\nN.B. Skip the cream soda... the house Canadian brand tastes like ass.  Really, it tastes more like bubble gum, but either way... it's just wrong.
