I will never go anywhere else for a brazilian.  Ever.\n\nI had it done at a different place when I lived in SoCal (before Pretty Kitty had locations in SoCal) and it took 30+ mins and I was cringing on every pull and practically in tears it hurt so badly. Jeannie is amazing at what she does: quick and painless. Really. She gets it all and has never pulled off any skin, unlike other waxing jobs I've had done.\n\nWorth every single penny...and more.
