After a couple of visits now I can safely say I don't see why the reviews of this place are so high. Sure it's a dive bar, so I won't dock stars for the decor. I can honestly say they got one star for having my fave beer in bottle, I don't think I'd want anything from the taps here. \n\nThe Jays game was on, bonus, the crowd was into it, being the first time we've seen playoff baseball in this town in 22 years I was happy to be here to watch. \n\nWe were sat quickly considering the crowd, wicked timing. We perused the menu, I decided on the steak quesadilla. Unfortunately that was where the good times ended as our food arrived and sheer disappointment as I ate my quesadilla. Bland at first, way to much cheese I realized the cheese was probably covering a poor cut off meat as my next bite was full of fat. I gagged almost vomiting if back out. Unfortunately for me, my wife likes this place, hopefully she won't drag me with her next time. I'd be really hard pressed to eat here again.
