My android Yelp app was kind enough to show me which cafes near my hotel were open at 7am, which wasn't many. Java Jive was closest and the name was familiar. Their vegetable omelette was a small step down from the Croissant Tree, but it was only $5 and that included toast and (out-of-a-bag) homefries. Coffee was really good and the service was pleasant and quick. They could have spent a bit of time before opening cleaning up the patio furniture. The table was covered in street grime\/dust and I leaned back into some bird brap (not sure why I didn't see it). Probably good patio advice anywhere: watch where you're sitting. (On my second visit the tables were all wiped and the chairs were clean. A sparrow sat on the table eyeing my toast. Disgusting and cute all at the same time.)
