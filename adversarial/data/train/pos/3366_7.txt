So disappointed I missed out on Grandtheft last Thurs night...but not as disappointed as I was in the service here. The staff here is out of control, in the worst way possible. Rude. Arrogant. Horrible...... I. Can't. Even. \n\nBasically, one of the bouncers here (Josh) snapped one of our friend's ID's bc he thought it might be a fake. Unfortunately, this was NOT a fake ID. And this friend was visiting from out of state. But not only did he damage a government issued ID, he tried to brush it off as if it was not a problem and told us that the TSA would still let them fly, but we couldn't come into the club. When we asked to speak to the manager of the club so that we could get a written statement, some random guy who was NOT the manager but said he was (Christopher), came over to try and work out the situation. Ultimately we went to the hotel staff and spoke with the general manager to try and work out a solution. It took 2+ hours to get written statements and supposedly Metro was contacted but never showed. The whole experience just left me with a bad taste in my mouth. \n\nHere is ultimately my problem. Not only did this guy damage property that was not his, there were NO repercussions, and not only that, there was NO SOLUTION. First off, there is no reason that he should have broken the ID. I mean, aren't there scanners that can check for fake IDs? But fine, it happened. Then what?!?! You're just gonna leave it and NOT DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT? We didn't do anything wrong, you did. FIX IT. There was absolutely no accountability on the part of the staff at Encore. \n\nI'm sure the beach club inside is great, but I can't say the same for the staff that tend to it. \n\nIf I could, I would give negative stars.
