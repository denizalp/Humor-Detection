Tell me why I'm not surprised by the low rating of this club?\n\nExtremely small club compared to others. \n\nI have never been at a club where they treat girls so shitty. A guy invited me and my friends over to their table to chill. So we did and right away the security told us to leave becuz we were Asian and we didn't look Armenian enough to be in that group. Are you kidding me? Racial profiling? Even the guy was like \"no they're with us\" and the black security kept telling us to leave. \n\nAlright then. I'm a local. Ima girl with a buncha girl friends. I'm fine with never coming here again. Other clubs HELLA appreciate girls in their clubs. So screw this place.  It deserves a low rating.
