this club is very big,for a stripclub. I came in there, very late. It was like 1am. They had some hot strippers in there, but I just didn't like the setup of the place. The place, was just, too crowded for me. Also, they give lapdances, on the floor, instead of in private.To go private, it's like $150 or something. That's way too expensive. I got a lapdance on the floor, and I just did feel comfortable. There was a black chick, that looked like Aretha Franklin, that kept looking at me, while the stripper was giving me the lapdance. She looked pretty pissed off. Maybe it was because the stripper was white, I don't know.This stripclub had more of a dance club atmosphere. I rather have a stripclub smaller, so I can get more intimate with a dancer.
