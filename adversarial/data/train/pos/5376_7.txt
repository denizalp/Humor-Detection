I've had the Artesia location bookmarked forever, but I was never able to visit, so as you could imagine, I was thrilled when I found out that Café 86 would be making its way to the valley! As a lot of Yelpers have previously mentioned, I too discovered Café 86 on Instagram where you can find hundreds of photos of their photogenic desserts and pastries!\n\nMy fam and I visited on a Saturday around 3pm, and to my surprise, a lot of their desserts and pastries were still available, if not all of them. It took me a while to decide on what I wanted since everything looked yummy. I ended up ordering the Ube Crack Cheesecake, an Ube Truffle, and an Ube Butter Bar. \n\nOf the three, my favorite was definitely the Ube Truffle. It's not the prettiest dessert, but the ube flavor was prominent and the fact that it was coated in Oreos made it even better! I wish I ordered more than one! The Ube Crack Cheesecake was nothing special. There wasn't really any ube flavor and the crust was a little too hard for my liking. It tasted like a normal cheesecake to me. The Ube Butter Bar was good, very rich and had a nice texture to it.\n\nI was able to try the Churrochi that my sister ordered and it was way too sweet for me. It'd be better without the caramel drizzle, but the fried mochi was good overall. The classic cinnamon sugar churro flavor and crunchy coating paired well with the chewy mochi. \n\nThe Ube Monster was just okay. It tasted like the slushes I've had at other drink places before. It would be better if the Oreo crumbs were blended throughout the drink instead of just the top and the bottom.\n\nThe customer service was friendly and the cashier was especially patient with us when we were still unsure of what to order! She was very helpful and answered all of our questions, even suggested a few items too! She also helped us to register for their rewards program which can actually be used at all locations!\n\nWe'll definitely be back to try more of the menu!
