Great fast casual spot with asian fusion chicken bowls. It's a small restaurant off of Decatur where you order at the counter and they'll bring the food out to you. I like that they have crispy chicken and grilled chicken bowls in case you want to eat a little healthier.\n\nThey've expanded their menu since opening with over a dozen sauce options. The house specialty Crispy Mochiko bowl is always a great option. The perfectly fried nuggets of chicken are covered in a  sweet shoyu sauce with plenty of furikake on top. I found the crispy Thai satay in need of more peanut sauce, but still a satisfying meal with the brown rice, green onions and added vegetables.\n\nIt's a great fast-casual concept and one of the better inexpensive meals you'll find in town.
