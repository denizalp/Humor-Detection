This was the highlight of my stay in Vegas! I love shopping at high end places, for some reason it makes me really happy spending loads of money. \nThe mall itself is kind of small, but it is really pretty inside. \nSome shops here include Fendi, Barney's New York, Cartier, Ralph Lauren (includes Black Label) and Michael Kors.. Among others! \nAll the stores are really nice with marble floors and such! \nThis is the best place to go besides Rodeo Drive and 5th Avenue in New York if you're looking for an upscale shopping experience!
