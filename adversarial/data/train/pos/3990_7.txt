The outside is defiantly leaves room for the imagination  and parking would seem it could be a problem during peek hours , but I didn't have trouble. GO INSIDE!!!  It's awesome, clean , organized, neat and has great music playing. Super comfortable with relaxing colors and textures on the floor and walls. \n\nAt first you might be a little afraid of what you mind find on the other side of the dark tinted glass outside.... I mean it's not on the best side of town -wow... what a surprise:) !! \n\nThe food comes out HOT in big black heavy bowls! Not plastic cheesy - actual lovely clean heavy bowls! \n\nThe staff is super nice and on their game! The kitchen takes a bit of time to get the order out... but it's worth every single minute! \n\nThe ramen I got was vegan. The noodles were light and fresh with the most delightful vegan broth! You can tell by the delicious layers of flavor that this place takes it's time and doesn't rush perfection! \n\nThey serve wine , beer and saki - so all bases are covered here \/) \n\nGreat job Shinya !! You have for my vote .... I'll be back and I'll bring friends!
