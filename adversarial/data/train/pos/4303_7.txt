It's hard not to compare #1 Pho to its neighbor, Superior Pho. Definitely a nicer restaurant with more space than Superior Pho but the food is also more expensive. Pho was okay and not as fresh which left quite a bit to be desired. The broth didn't measure up to other places I've been to (should I start it off with 30 sec of walking to Superior Pho?)\n\nPretty good ambiance but the overall experience was dwindled by sub-par service. #1 Pho? No way..considering it is outclassed by \"Superior\" Pho (as the name suggested) right next door.
