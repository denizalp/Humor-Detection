I love this place! I have been going several times at their old location and that was always an amazing time. Abby D. did a surprise B-Day party for me there and even had my cousin fly out from Florida so this place will always be special for me. \n\nI just recently had the chance to check out their all new location on Indian Bend and they improved on greatness. The track now goes indoors and outdoors which adds a whole new element to the race. The karts are all electric, accelerate faster, are quieter, don't emit fumes and run a lot smoother. \n\nThe new location also has an awesome looking outdoor patio where you can watch the races from. It was too hot to hang out there in August but I have no doubt I'll be drinking some beers enjoying the nice weather soon enough. \n\nI also can't wait to do a nice big event for my employees there because this place was made for corporate parties! \n\nSo for sure go and check this place out you won't regret it!
