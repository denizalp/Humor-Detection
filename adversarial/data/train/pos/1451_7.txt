Ok, so I discussed it with my dad, and decided to give this place four stars ( I was going to give it five stars, but he convinced me that it wasn't 'special' enough to get five stars and then I decided that I would need to go again before making that decision. \n\nAnyway, I met my dad here for lunch yesterday at around 11:30 and the place had some customers, but wasn't crazy busy. We sat outside, and that was very nice. We decided to split the caesar salad with chicken and the chicken sandwich with the goat cheese and fig jam. The caesar was really good, the dressing tasted excellent and was tossed perfectly, and the chicken was also very flavorful, but the whole thing still had a light quality to it. It was tasty. The sandwich was also very good. I could taste each ingredient, which I like, the bread was good, crispy but soft at the same time, and the combo of flavors was really great. Also, the service was excellent, my water was never empty. \n\nSo I would most definitely come back here. I just think I need to try dinner here and some more complex dishes than what I got before I can give it five stars, but honestly, as far as sandwich places go, I liked this very much, better than pane bianco.
