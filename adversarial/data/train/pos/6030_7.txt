Trust believe this review. \nBad. Worst. Terrible. Expensive. \nThis has probably been the worst experience of vegas this hotel has ever given me\n\nFirst of all, parking is sh** and small. Their hotel window bright red tint reminds me I'm looking out into mordor of lord of the rings.\nFront desk people were nice. But have the slightest of clue of what to answer me about prices I'm paying or more info about my room. \n\nCasino: (more like my living room on Chinese New Year)\nThere are So little selection of slots, tables were 90% Chinese games and high bets. \n\nThere were 10x more employees than customer playing at any table\/slots. You could count about 15 people playing at any given hour and all of them seem to lose their money. \n\nFood: (or lack of)\nThe restaurants there are beyond ridiculous. I understand it's Vegas and all but it is so damn overpriced. Only Chinese food available. The best value there was their Vietnamese coffee (which tasted terrible too)\n\n\nCaution: and the $$$$\nThere is a price to all that you use in the hotel. From the shampoo to their tea bags. Got charged $63 for shampoo?!?!\nThere was a tag on the water bottle for $8 (that I didn't use) but nowhere on the bag of the shampoo or tea were any tags of any prices\n\nSeveral charges were made on my bank account with no authorization or further info. I had to call in twice to clarify. \nAn amount for deposit, an amount for the two nights I stayed, and an amount for \"authorization\" \n\nSo in all...\nTwo night stay for MLK weekend ended up to be $405 for me. So f**** ridiculous. Could have stayed on the strip for a cheaper\/ more fun\/ less headache experience. \n\nNever ever coming back. They will go out of business anyways.
