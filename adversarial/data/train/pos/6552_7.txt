Looking for an A-MAZING vegan pizza (sans cheese)? \n\nFollow our formula at Barro's:\nOrder a veggie special pizza with no sauce and no cheese\nAsk them to use the white pizza mix as the sauce (oil, herbs and garlic)\nAdd a side of marinara sauce for crust dippin if desired\n\nResult = Stupidly awesome vegan pizza. We loved it.\n\nWARNING: It seems the \"white pizza mix\" may have Parmesan cheese in it. Not sure if it varies by location or not, but we've been given different answers at different locations. I suggest speaking with a Manager at the location you are ordering from to confirm this. We've had to ask for just olive oil, garlic and herbs as the base on a few occasions (rather than the \"white pizza mix\").
