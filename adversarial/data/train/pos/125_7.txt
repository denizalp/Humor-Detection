This is hands down the best breakfast place in town. They do a super lunch and dinner as well, but I usually can't get off the breakfast selections. The \"California Omelette\" (Avocados, Mushrooms, and Jack Cheese) is superb, as is \"The Volcano\" which is made up of three fluffy \/ yummy pancakes, sausage, bacon, and eggs. \n\nAs other reviewers have noted, portions are ginormous. Go planning to share a selection or take at least another meal home with you. There can be a wait on the weekend, but once you get seated, service is prompt and attentive. (Albeit the Fuzzie Bear that walks around can get a little creepy around the fourth table pass).\n\nBBD is supposed to be known for their desserts and they do look good, but the blackberry pie that I took home was more than a little tart and the crust was on the tough side. I wouldn't let this stop you from sampling as it could have been an isolated experience based on their reputation.\n\nThere are actually a few locations in the Phoenix area, so visit their website to see which one is closest to you. http:\/\/www.blackbeardiner.com\/\n\nThis definately isn't your parent's Denny's!
