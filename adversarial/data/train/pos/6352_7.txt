What a cool concept for food and drink on the go! \n\nThe menu at Chew and Chug is very simple. You start by picking a base, either fries or fried rice. Then move onto the proteins, Tenderloin or Ribeye from the land, and Scallops, Salmon and Shrimp from the Sea. Lastly, you pick a fountain drink, sweet tea, lemonade or beer (coming soon). If you want additional items, you can add onion rings, mozzarella sticks or even grilled veggies. I loved the garlic shrimp a lot, it's very flavorful. \n\nThey're currently having a grand opening deal so it's about $10 for a cup. Very convenient and great if you're walking around the strip looking for a quick bite. \n\nWould definitely stop by again the next time I'm in Sin City!
