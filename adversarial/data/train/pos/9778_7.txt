This is the best steak you're gonna find for under $20....for under $10 (6.99 + a $2 drink).  \n\nAlso, the beers are great tasting and you won't find a cheaper beer.  $1.50-2 for a tall one....just don't be a cheap ass with your tips...to get full and drunk in this place can be had on a $20 bill.\n\nBUT\n\nYou have to deal with a usually long wait for a table, even when there are tons of obviously open tables....\n\nBad service....this is hit or miss, sometimes you get great service, other times you get horrible service.  Your steak WILL come out underdone a degree, so if you are like me and enjoy medium rare steaks,  order medium.\n\nOld and smelly location....looks and smells like old vegas in here.  Reeks of smoke and old people.\n\nBut if you can look past all the good, the food and drink make it worth your while
