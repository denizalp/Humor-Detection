Best quicky wedding ever! The Little Neon Wedding Chapel is the go to destination for love birds! Beautiful decorations, flattering lighting, and friendly staff. The photographer right now, Isa, is amazing! Isa wasn't there for any of my other weddings but I believe her photos are all the good luck we need for a happily ever after! My one suggestion is maybe a punch card? For us frequent fliers? Thanks Little Neon! Ninth time is the charm! All my love, the brand new Mrs. Taylor!!
