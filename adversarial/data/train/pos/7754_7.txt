I sat down at the bar around 545p on a Wednesday. It was fairly slow. Bartender did not pay any attention at all. I asked a barback for menus & he gave me water. \n\nI continued to look at the menu for 15 minutes before the bartender came around to check on me. \nI ordered a glass of wine. By that time my friend had joined me at the bar. \n\nThings were way better when Jessica the bartender started her shift. She was very attentive and knowledgeable about the menu. She made some excellent recommendations. \n\nMy friend n I enjoy a few appetizers and couple glasses of wine. The apps were full of flavor. My favorite was the octopus. I didn't really care for the chicharones, it had good flavor but it was like eating dry fried chicken. \n\nThe menu is quit pricey though. Too bad they do not have a happy hour.
