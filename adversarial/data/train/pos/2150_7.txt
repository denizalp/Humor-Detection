Walked in to brothers three the other day, been there a few times, ya I kinda like dive bars it was dimly lit and looked like the 1970's in there. It was packed on a late Saturday morning, the people looked and acted like they could have been your neighbors ( if you have nice ones ). I got to tell ya the food is home cooking and in large portions, Prime rib sandwich is absolutely one slab of awesomeness. Meat hankerin taken care of! Walked out, man it's bright out here , expected to see Kawasaki triples ,hemi cuda's and chevell ss's , No just moped and eco Sh-t ,    I'm going back in!
