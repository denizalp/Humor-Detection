So.....I know it's opening weekend for the new Publix across the street from the Harris Teeter that I have shopped at for 8+ years, but HT was deserted and Publix was packed. There were more cashiers at HT than customers, and for the first time ever they actually had people to bag groceries. They still don't offer to take them out to the car though. I only went in because they had 3 items for free with the loyalty card. \n\nThen I went across the street to Publix. Parking lot full, cars circling to find a spot. I know there are many people trying out the new store, but I also saw quite a few full carts, not just people picking up a few things. The staff as usual was great, samples on every aisle, people stocking shelves and walking customers to the products they were looking for. At the registers, they had every line open, with of course somebody bagging groceries. The young lady that bagged my order was just starting her first shift, so a manager was giving her tips on how to bag. Then he reassured her to keep 2 hands on the cart, and to stay 2 feet back from the other customers as she walked. The cashier gladly accepted my Harris Teeter $10 off $50 coupon as well as the other coupons I had. \n\nIs Publix less expensive than HT? I'm a careful shopper, so I buy where the price is better, which sometimes is HT. But overall, the lack of service at HT will keep me as a loyal Publix customer, just like back in Miami.
