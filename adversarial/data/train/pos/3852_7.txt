Solid independent cafe amidst the sea of chain cafes in the area (Starbucks, Second Cup...). It's a little small and crammed inside. There's a communal table and a very narrow ledge with stools at the front, and a ledge at the back (for standing). But in the summer, the back patio is a great little spot to take a break. In the winter though, because the space is so small, beware the constant chill of cold air blowing in from the door. They put a curtain there as a barrier, which helps but doesn't totally block that Canadian winter... \n\nI like their espresso based drinks and they have lots of options for other kinds of specialty coffee drinks or tea lattes. If you want something cold to go, they have Village Juicery juices. They make their own bread! It's great. The baked goods look nice too although I've never tried them. Service is efficient and friendly. They have a loyalty stamp card. \n\nI would say this is a good place to grab a coffee if you need a quick break. But I wouldn't come here for an extended time (e.g. to do work\/read, or a long catch up with someone) because the limited seating and high foot traffic makes me guilty if I stay too long.
