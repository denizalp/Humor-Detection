I don't own any Hermès items but my best friend was in town visiting and we needed a little high end retail therapy. She has quite the designer scarf collection and was attempting to track down a specific jaguar print Hermès scarf so we stopped by the shop. \n\nAs would be expected in a fancy schmancy store like this, the service was aloof but friendly. Our saleslady loosened up a little bit when my friend started rattling off the actual names of the patterns of all the Hermès scarves she owns. They had one she loved so we made an easy purchase. The scarf was packaged with care in a cute little box and bag, and she was thrilled.\n\nThis store has a good selection of scarves, housewares, bags, men's leather goods, and saddles. Yes, even saddles. If you're a fan of the brand (I can't say that I am a fan of Hermès), then you'll probably want to make a point to visit this branch when you're in Las Vegas.
