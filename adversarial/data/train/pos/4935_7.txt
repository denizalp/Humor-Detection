I've been to this location a few times now, and I guess it's time for me to write a review of this place.  Honestly, of all the grocery stores big and small here in the Valley, Trader Joes is probably my least favorite.  Over the years, I've tried to like them..trust me, I've TRIED. I just can't get into the Trader Joe's scene.\n\nIt's not one particular thing that turns me off about Trader Joe's, but maybe its a variety of small things that irk me. For starters, I find thier food selection odd.  Mostly prepackaged stuff, with no deli, meat counter,  and very little name brand stuff.  I know I know, I don't need to buy every single thing name brand, but there are some things name brand that I prefer over others.  Plus, when I buy lunch meat, I want to go to a Deli Counter and get it, which they do not have.  Just prepackaged meats n cheeses.\n\nI tend to buy mostly sandwiches here during lunch hour.  Their fair priced, and right there.  The first few times I went here, I was getting a Tuna Sandwich on whitebread.  I liked it, and started buying it on a regular basis.  Then, they stopped making it.  Why?  I dunno, but I haven't seen it in like 3 weeks.  Just when I start liking something, it vanishes.  Now all they have are tuna wraps, but they arent as good as the sandwiches.\n\nAs for grocery shopping on a weekly basis, I will probably never be a regular here.  The reason I frequent this Trader Joe's is because its A) close to my office, B) there's a decent sandwhich selection readily available, and C) thier staff is always friendly and helpful.
