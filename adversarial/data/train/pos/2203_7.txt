You're kidding me, right? 5 stars? On a 50 point scale maybe! When I held up the pizza to the light, I could blasted see through it! If I want to pay $16 for pretty air, I'll come back. \n\nThe only positives were spending time with my colleague and Dave, our server - the nicest, fastest, most courteous guy in the joint. And is the only reason it got a single star.\n\nDon't know why this place is so overrated... Save yourself some time, money, and culture - order togo from Buca.
