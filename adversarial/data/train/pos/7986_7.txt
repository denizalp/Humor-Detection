Sweet Box and I didn't get off on the right foot. When we walked in it was a furnace because the A\/C was out. It was a hot afternoon so I was really looking forward to a tasty treat and some good ol' fashioned air conditioning. Thankfully the gentleman behind the counter was very friendly and apologized a million times about the temperature and that someone was on their way to have it fixed. It was cooler outside so we enjoyed our time on the picnic table out front.\n\nThe Sweetbox Coffee was rich and tasty and super strong. I didn't ask what was on top but it was like a rich cream that was so thick and delicious that it rested on top. We ordered the strawberry waffle too. There are a lot of really fun looking dessert and drink options on the menu but we went fairly basic and the waffle was simply that. Crispy but pretty flavorless waffle with loads of delicious cream and fresh strawberries.
