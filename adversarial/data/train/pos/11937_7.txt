Oh my, do I love this place!!!\n\nDo I only wish they had something like this in the bay area! This is sooo my kind of place!!\n\nLocated way off the strip in a  beautiful, new shopping center with tons of cutesy shops - The Blue Martini is located on the second floor of a clothing boutique.\n\nUltra chic, classy dimmed lighting, neon lit up bars, engaging lounge areas, classy pub tables and chairs providing plenty of seating, the lounge is extremely spacious with enough room to get your dance on ( which many were) they have 2 or three bars in the club, one main bar that's all neon lit up that has a stage set up right in the back for preformances and the particular band playing this night was extremely fun and certainly livened up the evening.\n\nOh and the Martini list?...Out of this world fantastic with just about every decadent concoction of flavorful drink's you can think of- all with a special Blue Martini touch!!\n\nThis evening I was a little stuffed from my previous meal so, I was unable to try all the Martinis I would have love too have though, I was fortunate to indulge in a few that were incredible.My first drink was the Blue Martini drink which is Van Gogh Blue Vodka, Citronge, Blue Curacao, Sour Mix, Orange Juice, served in an Oversized Snifter over Ice with a Glow Stick. This drink was strong though super delicious!!!! My second drink of the evening was The Skinny Bitch which was something I needed especially after feeling so stuffed the drink is Van Gogh Vodka, Tropicana 50 Blueberry\/Pomegranate Juice, and Blueberry Pur√©e which is only Under 25 Calories and tasted fantab and never would have though it was so low in calories.\n\nI had a really fun time here this evening especially with all the people watching of everyone dancing and having fun especially watching those who should not be dancing...lol\n\nDrinks are pricey at about $12.00 to $14.00 a drink though I heard they have a good happy hour with drinks at $7.000 half off on appetizers. \n\nI really, really look forward to my next visit,especially for there happy hour time....until next time!
