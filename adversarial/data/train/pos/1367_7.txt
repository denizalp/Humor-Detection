Where do I start........Sunday afternoon it was pouring rain and we all know that it's rare for it to rain in AZ. \n\nMy girlfriends and I decided to have brunch at Fame. I couldn't wait to taste everything on the menu.....\n\nFirst things first.....you have place an order before you can be seated so if your going to have a large group you need to have someone get there early to place everyone's order. \n\nAs our group trickled in each one of us had to wait in line to place an order. We had a nice waitress who let all of us be seated as she took our orders...\n\nLet's get to the food...... aghhhhhhhh I wanted to love this place, I really did..... but when I ordered the Huevos Rancheros... it was a soupy mess. Look I get it.... everything is organic. I love organic but I know organic taste good. This didn't taste remotely good. It was bland and the tortillas were hard and cold. The egg was cold!! I  hate hate, hate cold eggs..... \n\n\nStill hungry I reached over to my girlfriends plate to try her French toast..... what the @%#%...it was dry..... DID I CRACK A TOOTH....\n\nI took one for the team and didn't complain....I just continued to eat hoping it would get better. \n\nAs I'm washing down this meal with an blood orange mimosa which by the way was so tart everyone on the table had to add a package of sugar to it. YES....THIS WAS THE FIRST TIME IN MY LIFE THAT I EVER HAD TO ADD A PACKET OF SUGAR TO A MIMOSA!!!\n\nOkay..... so the vanilla honey latte was amazing and so was the bacon.  \n\nI actually place another order for bacon.....\n\nLook people love this place.... maybe it was a bad day considering it was pouring outside. \n\nFood should make you feel good and warm your soul....\n\nFame just didn't do it for me.... a quick latte, a muffin and scone. I'll show up but for brunch I'll pass....
