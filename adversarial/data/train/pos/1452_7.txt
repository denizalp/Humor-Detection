I'm gonna be honest, if it was my first time here id probably write a bad review but it isn't my first time so I can't. \nA couple years ago Swiss chalet was the perfect place that really 'hit the spot'. It was good chicken , the best fries and bomb Swiss chalet sauce. The right place for the family to come together and eat a nice meal together without hurting the wallet. But somewhere down the line things went wrong and everything seems different. \n\nThe chicken is still okay the sauce too but the quality of the fries are so much worse now. \n\nMy experience today: \nAs soon as we sat down the server came over with butter and ketchup I don't know why since we haven't opened the menu yet. All she said was \"can I get you something to drink \"\nSome servers are good some are not so good.\nAlso when we got our food she also brought the bowl with hot water and lemon.\nThe food was as it always was just okay .
