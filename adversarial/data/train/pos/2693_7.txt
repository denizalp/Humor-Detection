Loser O., you lose!  The statewide smoking ban is in effect, and nobody smokes in HH.\n\nI'm surprised that, with all the chatter here about the cheap beer, nobody's yet mentioned that Wed. is $6 steak night (steak & baked potato).  Before anybody jumps my case about this not being the most amazingly wonderful steak in the galaxy, pay attention -- it's a steak dinner (that's tasty), and it only costs six bucks.  What's the problem with that?  We can discuss it next Wed.
