I was passing by this old plaza and along the sudden I saw sushi place there, I was shocked that plaza can handle such a restaurant. Anyway we decided to stop and have a dinner. First of all we saw prices and we couldn't find all you can eat and we assumed it wouldn't be good for that amount of money but we were wrong, first of all we have been served with complementary food which made me half full already. We also decided to order sake and lady asked if we want medium or larger so we decided large, she brought us tea pot with sake WOW...anyway food came in and I was shocked of the potions, they were huge and good quality was amazing. It literally took us 2 hours to finish food we ordered and sake. I would recommend you to try sweet and spicy karaage, really tasty chicken! Other than that huge place, clean and big washrooms so go and try!
