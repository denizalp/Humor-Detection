Jacob's Field, you're killing me.  I was in town and visited you b\/c you and I haven't caught up since I moved away.  It was great seeing you again but let's talk about your bleacher seats.\n\nWhy do you hate the people who sit in the bleachers?  WHY?  Is it b\/c they have an aversion to seats?  Is it b\/c they paid less than other people in the park?  What is it?  What is the problem?  Tell me.  Tell me right now.\n\nMy buddies and I sat in these bleacher seats and tried to enjoy the game when we realized something very critical to the enjoyment of baseball was missing.  We had beer and food.  We also had a clear view of the gorgeous field and the not-so-gorgeous game of baseball which was presented to us.  We had all that.  What we didn't have were the vital game information telling us the inning, the pitch count or who the next batter was.\n\nIt took us a good half hour to figure out the only place that type of information was available in the ballpark was the HUGE screen that was right BEHIND US.  And here we thought we were drunk out of our minds.\n\nSo hey Jacob's Field - how about you show some love to the nice people in the bleacher section and have a place OTHER THAN THE BIG SCREEN BEHIND THE BLEACHER SECTION where they too can follow along?  Don't make a bunch of people break their necks trying to figure out what inning it is.\n\nGo Browns!
