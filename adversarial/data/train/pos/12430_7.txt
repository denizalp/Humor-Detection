Whenever I sit at a modern communal eating space, I like to pretend that I'm one of the characters in the Matrix movie.  I do this secretly in my mind.  No one else would understand my never ending battle to defend Zion from the horde of soulless machines.*\n\n*previous sentence was mostly a lie.\n\nThis place is definitely a bit odd.  It's what I would picture the Beverly Hillbillies would eventually build in terms of layout.  They'd hire some designer named Udo to distill what they love about bbqin', and stick it right next to the cement pond.\n\nThey have done this amazingly well actually.  Kudos to Udo, as it were.\n\nMy wife and I took some friends from out of town here after reading about it in an article.  It's the same awesome chef who introduced me to escolar tacos, and has opened Salt of the Earth.  That dude and I are on the EXACT same page when it comes to what I want to stuff in my face.\n\nAnd this place is no different.  Rather than the expansive, ever changing menu of Salt, this place has a sparse menu that focuses on pretty traditional BBQ offerings.  We had the pork shoulder, brisket, fried chicken, and collards, and then...we had fucking Meaty Mac.  I don't know why I never thought to just stick well cooked cuts of pig meat into macaroni and cheese, but I'll assume it's some defense shield that my brain made to make sure that my life's tale would be, \"Evan?  What's to tell.  He ate too much Meaty Mac and his heart exploded.\"\n\nEverything comes on a little metal tray with a little gingham placemat. (Rolls Eyes)  It can get to be a little too much.  Kind of like when you're trying to find the bathroom at a Renaissance Festival, and the one dude you asks refuses to understand you until you say whatever some dumb 15th century Florentine would say if THEY had to go to the bathroom.  I peed on that guys doublet FYI.\n\nSo, yeah.  I really, really loved the food, atmosphere, and it certainly didn't hurt to be there with awesome people.\n\nI really don't love sharing my eating space with strangers, but I must say that it does create a pleasant sense of community in this space.\n\nI have a feeling that this place is going to get really crazy packed in the summer, so I hope they have a plan to either expand or cycle people through with the utmost efficiency.  \n\nSalt of the Earth dude wins again.
