The worst, most boring show I've ever seen. I could have choreographed it better!!\nI wish I could describe better the dancing atrocity I saw last weekend. It was like they were moving in slow motio. It was super cheesy...giant penis prop and carousel horse were pretty bad. And all the REALLY bad lip syncing...Whatever, I guess it is at the Riviera, not the nicest Casino. At least it was topless.\n\nThe magic acts in between numbers were SOOO bad. Well, one guy was good, but it was seriously magic you can learn online or in a book, nothing too special. My friend got pulled on stage and ended up getting made fun of and getting a t shirt. That was entertaining.\n\nThe crowd was mostly 45+ couples! It was so bizarre! I felt bad for the dancers, the theater was only half filled. \n\nThank god I didn't pay for it.
