I really wanted a great burger and rings, which are so hard to find these days.\n\nThe Apache burger with cheese and bacon was ok.  Very limited toppings.  Given they only take cash and prices are the cheap, they could use more toppings, including real cheddar. \n\nOnion rings were terrible.  Very thick breading, but almost no onion in the middle.  The poutine looked reasonable, I wish I'd ordered that. \n\nDon't think I'll go back.
