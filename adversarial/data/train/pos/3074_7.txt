Okay, first of all this place gets major props for being in the same spot for at least 30 years.  I am guessing on the amount of years but it is a long time.  Dare I say a \"tradition\" in Las Vegas...\n\nAnywho.  I LOVE this place.  In fact it reminds me of home.  It reminds me of the local diner of yesteryear.  Try sitting in there facing the kitchen so you cannot see Decatur Blvd and you for get you are in Las Vegas!  I felt like I was sitting in a mom and pop joint in Idaho. (that's a good thing BTW).  This place has that mom and pop family restaurant charm to it with out even trying.  It is a real mom and pop joint.   \n\nI ordered the chicken fried steak and eggs.  The chicken fried steak was out of sight!  It was crunchy on the outside and tender on the inside.  It was thinner than other chicken fried steaks but it was huge.  They might tenderize real well that makes it wider and thinner, but that is only speculation.  It was smothered with gravy.  \n\nThe eggs, and I have said this before, a good breakfast joint has to perfectly baste my eggs.  This place served perfectly basted eggs.  Almost... almost... not quite as good as my mom does... almost.  I had the home fries with breakfast.  They were good.  It was just all around good breakfast food.\n\nThe portion was huge.  The prices were low.  Great value here!\n\nThe service was good. The waitress wasn't exactly warm but she had the diner waitress attitude that is borderline curt but at the same time likably crusty.  Kinda like Tommy Lasorda.\n\n\nSide notes\n** parking is bad - extra parking in the back\n**  Coffee was weak - next time I come throw an extra scoop in the hopper for me.
