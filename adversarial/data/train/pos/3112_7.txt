When you're craving a burger you expect to grab that burger with two hands. Unfortunately at Little big burger, you won't need two hands at all because it's actually a slider. \n\nThe burger wasn't a bad burger, but it's ridiculously tiny! For a minute I thought I ordered from the children's menu. Their fries are very good and I'd say they're shareable. I'm not a fan of fast food being A LA CARTE, but that seems to be the \"in\" thing. \n\nTheir prices are around 4-6 bucks for a burger and about 2-3 bucks for fries and another 2$ for a drink. I doubt I'll return.
