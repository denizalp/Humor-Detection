I was looking forward to checking out this place BUT I was VERY disappointed.... Went  on a Friday night with the family, the place was busy in the bar part of the restaurant.  Had to wait awhile before we were acknowledge and the girl server when asked about the beer selections did not know what they had at the bar.... We ordered the honey hot wings extra crispy which was the best thing of the meal.  It came with a side of ranch and two celery stalks. (see Picture) LOL .. I got a cheeseburger w\/ bacon ( see Picture) and my son got  a hamburger w\/ bacon. The burgers were bland and it came with SALTY fries.  My boyfriend got the pastrami.  Pastrami is salted when cured and added salt makes it very Salty.  It came to our table very SALTY.  Tried the cheese pizza from the kids menu for my 4 year old and it was bland and looked messy.  The cook added to much salt to our meal in the fries and sandwich.  The burgers had no flavor and  I will NOT be going back... Its not worth the price and irritation of a BAD meal.  The whiskey sour he had was also very weak for the price. Although the restaurant was clean and it look very nice in its renovated state that's the only reason it got a star.
