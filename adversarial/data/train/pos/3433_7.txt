Pretty nice festival albiet smaller than Japanese festivals\/gatherings than I'm used to.\n\nFood vendors, craft booths, stage competitions, bonsai showcase, live music and tons of cosplayers.\n \nThe setup is is pretty standard and was great to walk around to see what they had to offer. The crowds were definitely at it's peak by the time I stopped by and lines for food were massive. As expected food was also expensive, but appreciated that they took cash and card. It's easy to go through the entire festival unless you have live performances or shows to watch. Parking isn't that much of a hassle at all either.\n\nWish there were more to see and had more variety of foods as the only popular booths were that of ramen, takoyaki and boba.
