Seriously? One chef and maybe a little more than a dozen seats. Some couples were so desperate that they were willing to share stool space. (read 1 butt cheek per stool)\n\nI feel like this inefficient system was designed to increase the hype.\n\nMaybe I'm not a big enough glutton, but I don't think ANY food is worth waiting hours for.\n\nThis is also why I'd never care to eat a cronut.\n\nDidn't get a chance to try their \"magical\" pan roast and, frankly, I don't care if I ever do. You kind of wonder if all the rave reviews are actually due to delusions which are a result of hunger. Why anyone would subject themselves to the abuse of hours-long waits and slow, sub-par service for food is beyond me.
