I was last at MVM a couple of months ago for a Sunday lunch and the experience has stuck with me long enough that I can accurately recount my experience even now after all this time. \n\nLocated in the plaza at the north\/west corner of Rutherford and Bathurst, Me Va Me brings Middle Eastern cooking with an Israeli flare to the Vaughan Richmond Hill border with great service, class and a little casual sophistication.\n\nI began my brunch\/lunch with a Mojito, the ingredients were very fresh, and the drink was extremely well made, with great presentation!\n\nShortly after to follow I shared the grilled mushroom hummus (with grilled onions) appetizer with my DC.Served with fresh made pita with was an excellent starter for us both and its generous portion size was a sign of things to come.\n\nFor my main course I had the Lamb Skewers served with basmati rice and an Israeli salad on the side (similar to a Greek salad it was made with, cucumber, red onion and tomato chopped very fine, topped with fresh squeezed lemon). I could barely get through the entire portion!\n\nMy DC was sold by our server on their apparently famous chicken schnitzel entree - she really sold it well and her description had us both drooling. That said, nothing could have prepared us for what arrived soon after. A HUGE (likely 15-20 inches end to end) breaded and thinly filleted chicken breast, cooked to a crisp on the edges while remaining moist and delicious throughout! Shocking and amazing!\n\nBest of all was that they price did not reflect the portion size and overall was very reasonable considering everything that we got!. I'll be back again...maybe for dinner next time (Mojitos at brunch WAS a bit crazy).\n\nEat Crest OUT!
