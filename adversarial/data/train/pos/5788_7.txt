This mall is just ok.  I still prefer Chinook Centre and Market mall to be quite honest.  West Ed blows this place out of the water, still.\n\nIt got over hyped upon its opening and find that the selection of stores is just average.  Nothing to loose your top about.  \n\nI do like the fact that there is a wide assortment of private, non-chain stores and the Tim Hortons helps tremendously.  What I hate about it is if you get lost looking for a store, it is a long walk to get to the right \"neighbourhood\" and I never seem to be able to find a sign that points out where you are or a help desk when you need one.\n\nThe food court is great.  It is huge and there is something for everyone.  I also love that there are a couple of outlet stores but like another reviewer noted, just because it says outlet, doesn't mean that they have outlet prices.\n\nMy kids love the arcade\/theatre combo they recently opened up, but find you can never get a hold of anyone if you call in.\n\nReally can't stand the blaring music in the trendier stores, namely, Guess.  If I wanted to go to a night club, I would do so, I don't need your tacky-ass rave music blaring down my spine before I even set foot in the store.  Thanks.
