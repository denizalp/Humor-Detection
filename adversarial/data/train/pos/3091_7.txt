As soon as you enter from the parking lot, there is this nice little food court. (Check the Venetian Map for more accurate directions depending on where you have parked)\n\nThe first thing I thought of when I walked in was \"Dang! this looks like the food court at Brea Mall\". They have made to order or fast food, American or Ethnic, whatever you desire. \n\nPros:\nLots of options to choose from\n-Mexican\n-Italian\n-Indian\n-Traditional American burgers\n-Mediterranean\n-Japanese\n-Chinese\n-Subway, and\n-Desserts\n4 stars for having a Desi place (Curry Pot) at a food court! Unfortunately, the line was 30 Minute long, so we did not dine there.\nFinding seating could be a problem, however there is abundant seating to relax your legs before you walk another couple of Hours at this massive casino. \n\nCons:\nNo TV's, or good music in the background.
