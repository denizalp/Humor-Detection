I had a great time here.  Maybe it was the company, maybe it was the patio or maybe it was the cask beer but I enjoyed myself at Victory.\n\nThe good:\n- good beer selection and great prices\n- good looking menu \n- laid back staff (maybe too laid back) - but they let us bring over 4 chairs to a table for 2 with no problems or dirty looks\n- GREAT fries with dill dipping sauce\n\nThe bad:\n- our waiter was kind of a fail.  He took forever to bring us anything so much so that we went inside to pay at the bar because it was taking him so long.\n- The chicken wings were just okay.  They were crispy and saucy and came with veggies and dip but they were the wrong kind of sauce.\n\nThe EXTREMELY weird:\n- every single one of our wings was a wing.  There was not a single drumstick to be had.  It was eerie... but we didn't care.\n\nOverall, I would definitely come here again.  I would order something else and not be in a rush and it would have been great.
