The first time we went it was so good! The service was great, the food was some of the best I ever had. I went again and enjoyed the buffet at lunch - still a great experience. THEN we went last night and the food was awful! The service was non-existant and the worst part was the owner stood outside screaming at another man for over 10 minutes and then chain smoked for another 25. Did I mention he was our server? We had to refill our drinks several times and the other woman that was there just sat watching TV the whole time.\nI was so excited that there was a good Indian restaurant in Chandler and now I'm not so sure.\n\nIt's very expensive too!
