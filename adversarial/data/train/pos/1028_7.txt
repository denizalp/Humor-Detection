One day after a meeting my coworker and I stopped by this place to get lunch.  He said that this place is amazing, and he was right. \n\nThe restaurant was clean, the staff was super friendly and attentive.  The staff was very helpful in helping us decide what to get.  The service was pretty quick, probably because at the time it was slow.  And the bathroom was decent.\n\nWe ordered pulled pork and a pound of shrimp, which was absolutely amazing.  Super delicious!! The soda was refreshing, and the lemon that we got with our water was perfectly sour.  Good quality place over here.  \n\nOverall a good experience, we will definitely be back.
