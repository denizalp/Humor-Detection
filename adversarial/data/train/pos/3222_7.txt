Long overdue DOWNGRADE...\n\nLamar was our go to groomer...he is no longer here\n\nWhoever groomed Dolce on our last visit (about a year ago)is most definitely not qualified to be grooming ANY dog! She not only charged us extra on top of what we usually pay, but left both of Dolce's hind legs with furless with  pink patches. What's worse is that she was gonna just shave it all off without notifying us first. WTF!?!?!?\n\nHer reason? Dolce's legs were matted(we brush him out at least once a week)...yeah, always the excuse from previous groomers as well, because:\n\na) she was flat out lazy AF\n\nb) she didn't  want to take the extra time,  care, and pride in what Doggy Stylz does\n\nc) she's in no way qualified to be grooming dogs\n\nd) all of the above...ding ding ding!!!!\n\nTo this day, Dolce's fur on his hind legs haven't fully grown back like they used to be...Don't bother contacting me, because we've been done with Doggy Stylz for the longest time. \n\nShaka Meter: ZERO shakas, but one middle finger to the groomer who did this to our furkid
