Update Time\n\nGB is still a great spot to get your Greek food fix in Henderson.  I've been back for lunch multiple times since the first time I reviewed this place, usually for the chicken gyro and fries.  Today I finally switched it up, trying the avgolemono (egg-lemon) soup after some Yelp friends were talking it up yesterday.  Definitely lemony, this chicken soup with rice was a delightful accompaniment to the chicken salad, another first for me there.  Both are served with soft pieces of pita bread and it made for a delicious meal.  I took half of the salad to go since it's a generous portion and I was already a bit full with the soup.  This family-run business always has great service and I'm never disappointed with a meal there.
