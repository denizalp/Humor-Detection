I'll use this example of something I experienced last night to sum up my feeling on Hilldale.\n\nMy husband and I chose the wrong night to see a movie, the day after Christmas, so we decided to take a walk through Hilldale to kill time before our show. A gentleman in a Lamborghini is trying to find parking, and my husband jokes he must be looking for special rich man Lamborghini parking.\n\nHe then parks in a \"Expecting Mothers Only\" spot. \n\nI can't make this up if I tried.\n\nNow how does this relate to my overall experiences at Hilldale?\n\nSnooty, \"upper class\" patrons who shop at overpriced clothing stores like LuluLemon and Anthropology pretty much sums up my experiences. \n\nSo many a time I have come here to see a movie at Sundance, and I'm disgusted by attitudes of my fellow patrons, and the lack of stores that any normal person can actually afford. Am I faulting people for being well off and having disposable incomes? No, but I am saying that unless you have a disposable budget where prices don't matter, this shopping center is probably not for you.
