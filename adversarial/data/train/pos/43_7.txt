I used to come to this place before I found out about other Korean places around campus. Each place has their own specialties. I love getting the bibimbap and bulgogi from here. In my opinion, the soon du bu doesn't have much flavor. \n\nI started coming less and less because the owner at this place isn't too friendly. Also, once I came to get food and saw them refilling the water dispenser with a tub that didn't look so sanitary...made me lose my appetite.
