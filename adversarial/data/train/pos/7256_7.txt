Worst customer service ever. \n\nI came in and asked how much a polish change was for my previous gel manicure. $15. I showed the guy a picture of what I wanted done. He said, no we can't do that. He said they're stickers. I asked if they could draw it on. He said it wouldn't look like the picture. Then he just straight said we can't do it. That's it. Didn't ask if I wanted something else. Just simply no, we can't do it and was extremely rude about it.  Thanks. I'll be sure to tell everyone I know about my wonderful experience.
