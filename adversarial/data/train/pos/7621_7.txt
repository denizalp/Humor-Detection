Sometimes you just want to wander around a mall with your mom and little sister and try on summer dresses and buy socks and let mom look at strange crystal bird things. When I'm in a certain mental state the suburban mall has a weird appeal - all those things mall designers do to make you feel like time has stopped and like you could be anywhere in the world suddenly work for me: no street facing windows, just skylights; no clocks, just infinite intimate apparel options and Mmmmmuffins for miles. Fairview is staffed by it's target market: young West Islanders, so it is a little more fun than the stateliness of a Rockland and a little kinder and more interested in you than a mall downtown. End of the day, it's a mall, but for what it is it's plenty fine.
