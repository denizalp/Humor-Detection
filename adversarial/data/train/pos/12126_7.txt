The Welcome to Fabulous Las Vegas sign is a Las Vegas Strip landmark funded in May 1959 and erected soon after by Western Neon. The sign was designed at the request of a local salesman, who later sold it to Clark County, Nevada. The sign is located in the median at 5100 Las Vegas Boulevard South, north of the historic stone pillars of the old McCarran Airport on the east side, and across from the Bali Hai Golf Club and the (closed) Klondike Hotel & Casino on the west side. Some consider the sign to be the official southern end of the Las Vegas Strip. The sign, like most of the Strip, sits in the town of Paradise and is located roughly four miles south of the actual city limits of Las Vegas. However, such distinctions are usually ignored by both locals and tourists, who refer to the entire metro area as \"Las Vegas\".\n\nThis is a Classic and Iconic piece of Pop Art, and it was the first thing I remembered as my Dad drove us into Las Vegas sometime in the 1960s. The best knockoff (IMHO) was the Yahoo! sign, now departed from the approach on the San Francisco side of the Bay Bridge.
