BS +++\n\nCOT DAMN! I finally found  a breakfast spot here in LV that's worth  reviewing.  Coming from NYC breakfast is important.  This place is as good as it gets.  The hostess is super nice and cool.  The waitress is super nice and very attentive.  I ordered the XTRA protein breakfast.  The  cook kills it! Everything about this place is good.  I checked out the restroom and it's clean and  it has a slimming mirror.  Pajamas! They wear pajamas! How chill is that? \n\nI recommend to visit this place whether you are a local, a tourist, or just hangry like I was.  I saw check out the website before you come  so you can  set your target on your food and order ASAP!  And lastly, there is a big cock by the door and I'm not talking a rude  guy either.  It's so cool!\n\nFood is BOMB\nRestrooms are CLEAN\nTables CLEAN\nTable wait time NONE\nTake out wait time is QUICK\nMood is CHILL AF\nCustomer service is GREAT (super friendly and huge  smiles)\nAmbiance Super hipster like with upside down umbrella\nKitchen SUPER CLEAN\n\n* Boomsauce scale.\nBW = Dis $@% is BASURA! (Garbage).  Not recommended.\nBS = it's just O.K. (experience)\nBS+ = Yo! I like this place.\nBS++= That's Whoa! This place good.\nBS+++= Dayumm! This place is fkn DOPE!
