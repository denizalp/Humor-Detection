A place I would definitely go back! \n\nThis place has been on my to eat list for awhile. I decided to come here to celebrate CNY weekend. I had the early reservation and was lucky to get seated in the private dining room by the window. \n\nI've tried a few tasting menu in town such as e by José Andrés and L'atelier. This place is probably my favorite right now considered the service, environment and quality of food. \n\nA few of the memorable dishes of the night.\n\n1. Artichoke and black truffle soup. It was sooo good and it has no chicken stock or cream in the soup. Along with the toasted mushroom brioche, it was just amazing! \n\n2. Coconut tapioca dessert. It was not sweet. Just the way I like it. The flavor was awesome. I'm craving for it as we speak! \n\n3 Foie Gras. It was cooked perfectly and paired with yuzu purée. Excellent dish as well. Although I found the beets infused tea tasted funny for some reason. \n\n4 Chestnut all around. Flavor was awesome with mushroom on the side and inside of the chestnut shell. \n\nI will definitely visit Guy Savoy again. Maybe in France next time.
