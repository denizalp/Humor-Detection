I now understand why they call this place \"The Worst Walmart in America.\" During the short ten minutes I was in this Walmart, it certainly lived up to this title. If I could give this place zero stars I would.\n\nWhen you enter the parking lot, it's a total free for all. Everyone driving everywhere, honking, running into things, total chaos. The lot is literally covered in trash. From paper and packaging and moldy food to dirty diapers and medicine bottles, just trash everywhere.\n\nBut wait, it gets worse. You walk into the store and there's trash on the floor. Merchandise everywhere. There are tons of checkouts but only a few open. The lines look to be an hour long. The employees look miserable and unapproachable. Customers are yelling profanities and cutting each other in line.\n\nAnd then there's the bathrooms. Every single stall is trashed. Really destroyed. The toilet seats ripped off. Poop all over the floor. Clogged and overflowing toilets. Paper towels anywhere and everywhere. It looks like a war zone. \n\nNeedless to say, after seeing the state of the restrooms, the atrocious lines, the merchandise strewn across the floors, and truly feeling scared for my life, I decided it was in my best interest to just call it a day and get out of this pathetic excuse of a retail establishment.\n\nBottom line, don't go here. DO NOT GO HERE. It's not worth it. Not for anything. Go anywhere else.
