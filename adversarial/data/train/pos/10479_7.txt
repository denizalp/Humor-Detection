Took a sec to find as it is down a few steps in a row of cafes and restaurants. The menu was entirely in French and busy enough that I was overwhelmed for a sec, good thing Chicken Pita is almost a universal phrase. This comes in a thin pita that's more like a rough wrap and is accompanied by some cabbage, pickled something red, maybe beets and a light garlic type of white sauce. It was thin enough to manage but more than enough and left a nice drizzle of grease running down my arm, always a sign of a finger lickin good gyro. Thanks Yelp for pointing me in the direction of Boustan, Montreal.......PS I wound up eating a second one a few hours later....always a sign of an amazing pita.
