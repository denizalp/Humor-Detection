The food is great. I love the chocolate shake!  \n\nTwo complaints:\n1. I'm not a fan of it being a cash only place since I don't like to carry cash. \n\n2.this is not a place to take your kids. I'm not a fan of the nurse's outfits and the ensuing spankings if you don't eat your meal. I admit it made me a little uncomfortable. \n\nIt is also a pricey establishment, but I think that needs to be expected if you're eating in a location where it's at. \n\nI think this is a place you should go at least once for the experience, just don't take your kids.
