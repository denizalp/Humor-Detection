So it is the smallest Oregano's I have been to, and probably the one with the worse layout. But to finally have an Oregano's in Glendale within a 10 minute driving distance from my house is simply wonderful.  \n\nThus far, we have been lucky to have no wait.  We also get decent service every time.  And they usually have one or two decent beer on tap like something from Lagunitas or Four Peaks. Would love it if they can add more craft brews. \n\nWe had ordered the Big Beefstro salad, and it was not worth it.  But salad, beer, and pizza does not really make sense, so I say skip the salads.  Its always a bit of a wait for their pizza, so you might wanna order an appetizer + a pitcher of beer and just have glut fest.  That is why you are here right? \n\nMe and my hubby seem to always get the same pizza.  We have tried others but most of the time we get the Hawaiian style with an add of roasted garlic.  This and a pitcher of good beer = winning combo.
