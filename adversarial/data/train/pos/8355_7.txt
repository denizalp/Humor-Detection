Dear Fox Rent A Car,\n\nI don't care how low your rates are compared to other car rentals - I will never use you again, and here is why:\n\nWe had rented an SUV from LAX to drive to Vegas.  The LAX folks were really nice.  When we got the car, we did the inspection and found several, very light and faint scratchs on the side bumper.  We pointed this out the attendant, who was like \"yeah, those are so tiny, don't worry about them\".  Great!\n\nThe reason why we were doing this drive, is because we had just come back from another trip and were heading my super BFF's wedding and we wanted to use the car to drive around town to run last minute errands.\n\nNow, the original plan was to return the car that Monday morning (which is what I had the reservations for), however, a few extra errands came up and I needed the car for 5 more hours.  I called the main number (the 800 number) to ask what were the charges for this, and what did I need to do to extend my reservations.  I was told that it would be $40 more to keep it for 8 hours, provided that I returned the car by 9pm that night.  Awesome.  No problem!\n\nWe finish with the errands by 5pm, and at 6pm, we pull up into the Fox Rent A Car office...which is in the middle of nowhere (it's no where near the airport...what the hell???).  But it's fine.  As we pull in, the attendant IMMEDIATELY starts pointing out all the tiny scratches that were on the bumper (which were truly light - I tried taking a photo of it, and it didn't even come out in the photos)...AND even pointing out to DIRT STREAKS on the side of the car as \"damage\".  ARE YOU KIDDING ME???\n\nMy husband and I travel all the time, all over the world, and we almost always rent a car.  This was the first time - EVER - that we were treated like this.  I'm not saying that they shouldn't point out damage when it's there, but the attendant was rude, accusatory and wouldn't let us say a single word.  Everytime I started to explain what the attendant at LAX told me...she would cut me off and point out to another scratch.  When I used spit to clean up the dirt streak - she started to peer at it and stare at it...as if my salvia is magical camoflauge and she was waiting for the dirt to appear again.  WHAT THE HELL???\n\nBut wait.  This wasn't the bad part. \n\nFinally, after 30 minutes of explaining and arguing, the attendant finally decides \"not to charge us\" for the damages...but pointed out that our return was late (which I told her when I pulled up, but she clearly didn't want to listen to me).  I was like \"yes, and I called the main-number to notify them that it wouuld be late\".  She then pointed us to the office - since it was late, we had to check in at the office to pay the late charge.  OK, not a problem.\n\nWe head to the office, and I hand the cashier my credit card...to get a credit card slip that charged me $265!!!  The rental from Friday - Monday morning was only $150...WHAT was this $265 charge?!?!  Thinking that they must not have noticed that I had already paid the $150 for F - M, I point this out to them...and they tell me that the $265 was because the car was late.\n\nWHAT WHAT???\n\nI told them that I called the 800 number that morning and that I was told that it was only going to be $40.  The cashier rolled his eyes and said that this was the late charge and he doesn't know anything about $40.  Back and forth and back and forth.  \n\nMy husband asks for the manager - but when the manager comes out, he doesn't even let us tell him what was happening, he just looked at the screen and said \"you have to pay this\".  Um, NO.  I don't.\n\nWe were there for 90 minutes arguing with the manager and the cashier.  Neither of them could explain why it was $265 for the 8 extra hours and not the $40 that their main office told us it would be.  My husband finally started to call the 800 number so that he could get someone from the corporate office on the phone, but the moment the customer service rep heard that we were disputing something...they hung up on us.\n\nARE YOU KIDDING ME????????????\n\nFinally, after 90 minutes - where I finally told them that they could TRY to charge my card, but I WILL dispute it and I will happily show up in court to dispute this, the manager very condensendingly told me that he would \"waive\" the $265 \"as a favor\".  Um.  FUCK NO.  You are not doing me any favors, don't try to pretend that you are.\n\nSHADY SHADY SHADY.  Awful customer service.  Awful awful awful.\n\nOh, and that shuttle bus that will take you back to the airport?  Yeah, by the time we were done with this fiasco (we arrived at 6pm...it was past 8pm when we left the office), the shuttle was only running ONCE AN HOUR and we \"just\" missed it (we ended up catching a bus a block away).\n\nUh-huh.\n\nAssholes.
