Yeah, most of the one and two stars are sadly true, we ended up eating our sushi with nothing to  hold soy sauce in so we can dip the sushi in.  \n\nThe wait was incredibly long. Like long. Loooooooong.  It's a great place to have a date with someone you really like, like when you are on a dopamine rush and you can just stare into each other's eyes for hours, because it'll take that long to go through your meal. \n\nThe salmon sushi was pitiful. But the eel was good.  The sushi was not worth the money, it was pretty expensive. \n\nThe server we had was really nice and was apologetic for the wait, but I rather kofusion, I at least can get drunk off the white dragon there.
