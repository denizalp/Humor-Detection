Resting my head at Aria was not the most pleasant:\n-Bed was so uncomfortably soft, no excuse, these are brand new beds.  \n-ONE bathrobe?!?\n-Separate room for toilet, but c'mon it's not really private w\/the opaque doors.\n-Crazy board game playing guests next door, about TEN people crammed in 1 rm.\n\nPluses that propelled Aria back to 3-star status:\n-Competent staff: Housekeeping, Hosts & security.\n-Completely comped rooms on the any day, anytime I want.\n-Great smelling products.\n-Facial tissues in BOTH rooms, I get the sniffles in the morning.\n-AWESOME room control panel and door card reader.\n-Clean pool water, they don't allow drinks in the pool.
