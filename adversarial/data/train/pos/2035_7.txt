Not worth the hype! I went to check out this place based on a personal recommendation to do so as I love crafty cocktails and like to mix up the flavor combinations in my own drinks. They pride themselves on not being pretentious, but that's exactly how we were treated by 2 employees when we arrived. A complete disappointment right from the start. I had a mule and it was so ginger spicy that I could not finish it. I had a re-occurring thought while I was there watching people ordering and tasting their drinks 'sometimes classic drinks are fantastic as they are and don't need to be taken to the next level'. The nitro drink is a lot of hype and there is no extra flavor from all theatrics given. Look past the smoke and mirrors and you get high priced drinks for a hipster crowd. The upstairs area was closed off to us so we weren't able to move from the first floor and it got pretty busy at one point. I ended up having a few drinks but had no buzz when I left (I should have had a buzz). That means VERY little liquor in the drinks. I have had better cocktails (with liquor in them) in Madison. I really wanted to love this bar, but after that first experience I don't think I'll go back.  Huge bummer!
