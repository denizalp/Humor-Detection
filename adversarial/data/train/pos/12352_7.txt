How is this place even still in business? Hands down worst delivery service around. I was waiting around all day today for my parcel that was expected to be delivered today. I checked online and it said \"delivery exception\" and that I wasn't home or something. Ridiculous. I was home waiting all day.\nThen I get a call from fed-ex later this evening asking if I will be home Monday around the same time because I wasn't there today when they supposedly tried to deliver it. I checked downstairs only 5 mins after they supposedly tried to make the delivery and they hadn't even left a delivery slip.\nI explained this to the guy on the phone and he told me \" oh some of our delivery drivers are really lazy\". Seriously!!!????what kind of an excuse for a business is this? All of these people should be fired.\n\nThe worst of it is, if they don't bring the parcel to your home you have to drive all the way out to the airport to pick it up!
