This place is HUGE. I am pretty sure it's the biggest hotel\/casino on the strip(Or maybe I am making that up. WHO KNOWS). \n\nI stayed at the Signature at the MGM, which was a fantastic hotel, and it was linked to the MGM, so I spent a lot of time here at the pools, restaurants, casino, etc. \n\nThe hotel is pretty basic, but because it's so huge has a lot to offer. \n\n-MGM Garden Arena\n-Ka by Cirque du Soleil\n-Hakkasan- club that always has a huge line, and pulls in big name DJ's like Calvin Harris(who I have actually heard of)\n\nGreat restaurants, including where I dined Tom Colicchio's Craftsteak, which is fantastic. \n\nThis place really has a lot to offer, I just wasn't feeling it. \n\nI did like the fact that there were a few quick-service type food places open late, and the casino floor has a 24-hour Starbucks. . The Pool area, with the Lazy River was huge, and pretty awesome. Lots of bars, food, etc available there. \n\nThe shopping isn't great though, and none of the shows really appealed to me, and the casino, while huge, wasn't really that memorable. \n\nAll in all though, I wouldn't go out of my way to go to MGM Grand unless you want to check out the restaurants or shows. The MGM Grand does have a lot of great shows, and there are a lot of fantastic restaurants.
