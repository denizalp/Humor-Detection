Was in here last night for a regular full body massage session. \n\nWhenever I call in to book an appointment, it is always done with the same lady(Lucy). And I am pretty sure their order of business is as such(promotes client relationships etc). However, Lucy has now decreased her hours at this location (sadness), so I had to try a different person. \n\nThe tricky part is, I practically LIVE for massages so I was appreciative that they recommended me 2 different people with the same style of my previous masseuse.\n\nSince I buy packages (which aren't available anymore as of Jan 2012) I decided to use one of my appointments with \"Linda\". Now, I always knew a style of a masseuse is different but I never realised that having a different style also means a different order to how your service is done. With Lucy it was hot towel, acupuncture with a heat lamp, oil massage increasing circulation, deep tissue then medium to light scalp and forehead massage- which is what I have been used to for 5+years. \n\nI cannot even wrap my head around or explain how my poor aching muscles jolted to have this order changed on me. Coming here is \"me time\" for a much needed state of relaxation- to the point where I actually fall into short naps on the table. When I walk out I feel relaxed. Unfortunately this visit fell short of that.\n\nOn the way out the lovely girl at the front enquired about my session. I mentioned it wasn't the same and she immediately apologised and sent me back into a different room with another girl for a \"trial\" - which was about 15min comparing to the regular 60minutes. I had no idea that you could even do that!\na trial! cool! - After the 15minutes there was birds singing, muscle loosening, head clearing kind of feeling. Then I woke up   -_-\n\nThis visit determined my loyalty to this business. They really know how to take care of a client. \nAnd super bonus came when the front girl showed me the availability for appointments for this new masseuse. Not to sound cheesy but that really gave a spring to my steps  - left foot , right foot.......baah I tried.  \n\nxoxo\nM.
