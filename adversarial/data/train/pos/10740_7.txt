Came here on a busy Saturday morning. Our party of two waited about 15 minutes. The host and waitress were great - very friendly. Food was amazing, too. Wife ordered the blueberry danish pancakes with scrambled eggs on the side and loved them. I ordered the corn beef hash with eggs over easy and an English muffin. It was delicious! Coffee is brewed fresh and they also serve adult beverages, freshly squeezed orange juice, and iced teas.
