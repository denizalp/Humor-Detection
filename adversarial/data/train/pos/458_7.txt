Go for a sandwich...but don't overlook the soup, every one that I tried was delicious. (Butternut Squash with Ginger this time...amazing! ).\nAnd I can't leave without a muffin or 2 for later. \nMy husband loves the real Ginger Soda.\nStaff is always friendly!  And they are in the process of putting up a better menu on the wall.\nGotta love Baguette Cafe!!
