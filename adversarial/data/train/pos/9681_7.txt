From the outside this cafe appears to be very nondescript, when you enter through the side door however a trendy lounge unfolds. Rows of low contemporary couches and cozy table settings fill this multilevel cafe and lend for a casual environment, where one can grab a coffee or a full entree. It is unusual to see a \"cafe\" that serves such a wide variety of coffees, desserts and entrees. Their dessert counter was full of various delicacies and the three page menu lended to even the most colorful of palates. I was out with the girls for a late night chirp-fest, and thus iced coffees and appetizers were on our agenda. After the frothy frozen latte, I could barely consume the bruschetta and calamari. After a few bites however, I made room. The calamari were not your usual over fried mini bites, but rather large looping seasoned morsels. Homemade tzaiki finished the bite perfectly, as the greek yogurt cut through the light garlic and greek seasoning with ease. The bruschetta will get an OK only as the bruschetta itself was over chopped and parsley-d. It was a healthy portion and several members of the party thought that it was great. All in all the calorie-fest was worth every penny. The only thing that dropped this from a four to a three star, was the lack of reliable service. Though we were spoken to relatively quickly, our waitress left halfway through the meal, and her replacement was forgetful and a little bit dippy. She forgot several of our drinks, and all requests for refills fell on deaf ears. I'm sure that a different waitress may turn this 3 star into a 4. Bottom line, a return visit is in order, and hopefully the service won't be a mirage. (pun intended)
