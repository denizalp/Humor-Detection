Two words:  Catherine Deneuve.  What other Montreal restaurant (of any stripe?) can boast a photograph of Catherine Deneuve (and Leelee Sobieski [?]) on premises, and positively glowing after what was obviously another amazing Malhi Sweets meal?*\n\nMalhi Sweets has been my go-to Indian restaurant for well over 10 years now (even before Ms. Deneuve paid her fateful visit).  It's just wickedly, consistently good, and I've always loved the friendly, no-frills ambience and the grace and charm of the moustachioed owner.  \n\nFunny thing is, I was a vegetarian when I started going to Malhi Sweets, and I still tend to order vegetarian every time I go.  Standards include the pakoras, the dal makhni (with 35% cream), the baigan bharta, the channa, the vegetable korma, and the garlic nan.  If only they would bring back the malai kofta, which was my very favorite Malhi Sweets dish of all-time, the one that literally drove me crazy (I literally couldn't rest until every last morsel, every last drop, had been devoured).\n\nHot tip:  if you ever see a plate of chili pakoras on the front counter, order some!  They're awesome, and I've never seen them anywhere else in Montreal.\n\n* What I want to know is:  who's the genius who insisted that Catherine Deneuve visit Malhi Sweets?  I wish it had been me...
