Oh my gah! One of the chicest and most delicious spots on the strip for lunch! I am so glad my hubby and I dined here during our last trip to Vegas. From the decor, to the service, to the food, to the view, it was all so wonderful. We went straight for entrees this outing and gave the grilled cheese and arugula salad a try! Boy am I glad we did. The salad was so fresh, the vinaigrette dressing was just right and the chicken was to die for! It reminded me of the chicken schnitzel off of the streets of Israel! My hubby got the grilled cheese and \"shoestring fries.\" Toasted to perfection featuring succulent cheese and pesto sauce...need I say more?! The fries were crispy and lightly flavored with vinegar and salt. One word: DELECTABLE. Even though we skipped the appetizers, we sure did indulge in dessert! If you're a Nutella lover, go for the donuts. They come out warm, drizzled with powdered sugar and a side of Nutella. Aside from the stellar food, the service was fast and the server was very knowledgable about the food items. My hubby drinks a ton of water and not once was his glass left empty. Love a conscientious serving team. Do yourself a favor and book a reservation at one of Las Vegas' finest establishments, Giada, the next time you're in town. You won't be disappointed!
