Ugh....\n\nI went in humming \"I want my babyback, babyback, babyback\" and left wanting to give the babyback, babyback babyback.\n\nI'd never had the ribs before and since I had a 3 hour layover and a 4 hour flight I thought it was a good time to try a larger meal. Turns out it was a large meal of nothing. \n\nThe \"steak\" fries were the best part and they were just tolerable. Cut like McDonald's fries, I was left wondering what made them \"steak\" fries... a little seasoning? A least they were cooked correctly. Not the crunchy outside, vacuuous inside alien food you get at a lot of places.\n\nThe corn on the cob was actually gross. It had been cooked so long ago all the starch had turned to sugar. It tasted like cream of corn... too sweet, artificial sweet. It was also so water logged that water literally poured with each bite. It should be served in the middle of a kiddie pool with a headrest so you don't drown when you fall asleep from boredom. I couldn't take more than a few bites. \n\nThe Bar-B-Que sauce was extremely vinegary... pucker vinegary... and I like vinegar! It left little room for any flavor. \n\nUnfortunately, it appears the sauce and the ribs had only just met as the ribs had no flavor... none. This provided for some sharp flavor contrasts that were none too appealing. The meat wasn't quite tough.. but not falling apart either.... and they were well done. So well done that the fat and any natural flavor had left them long ago. \n\nThe service and management were very good. Seating was crowded for a normal restaurant and unbearable in a restaurant where everyone has luggage.... the physical kind... not the mental kind. That's another story. \n\nIf you're traveling through Charlotte my advice is to let your mom pack your meals in your carry on like she wants to and mortgage the house so you can buy a soda or two once past security.
