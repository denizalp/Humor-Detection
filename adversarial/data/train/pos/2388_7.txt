Where's the love for mint + chocolate, hello? \n\nI sampled \"The Grasshopper\" at the tail of Cupcake Crawl II: The Reckoning last weekend and it was by far my favourite cupcake of the day, and definitely one of the top minty dessert contenders in the city. I don't care what any of you naysayers say - mint and chocolate BELONG together, and they were paired together perfectly here.\n\nI adore FTLOCCC's cupcake legend, describing all of their flavours and accompanied by a photo and ingredients listing. A beautiful takeaway souvenir that's well designed and a genius idea altogether. They don't always have every cupcake (or mancake) available so call ahead if you're looking for something special.\n\nNOTE: This small shop is in Liberty \"We Want To Make It As Difficult As Possible For Customers To Find Us\" Village, so take note that it's in the sort of strip mall complex of stores - just follow your nose. An address won't help you here.
