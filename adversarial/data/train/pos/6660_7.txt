I have never seen MindFreak nor did I know anything about Criss Angel, okay fine, I knew he was 'seeing' Pam Anderson.  \n\nI have never liked magic or been interested in it, but I'm always one to try everything before spewing about it, so when I saw that the Modern Day Houdini was bringing a show to Vegas, I bought the tix online for the darkest, spookiest day of the year: Halloween.\n\nOur section was 103, but we were seated at 203.  \n\nWhy you may ask?  B\/c the 10\/31\/08 was canceled for 'Opening Night', invited guests only, just my luck.  \n\nWell we turned on a little charm and we got in, too bad the show was a let down, but hey, it was FREE and the drinks were FREE too.  \n\nI think the coolest part of the show were the disappearances and reappearances.  Everything else was so predictable and phony.  \n\nI noticed a lot of people were leaving early, but then again it was FREE and it was a tough crowd.  Barely anyone was clapping or laughing-it was Halloween in Vegas, people should be off their rockers at 10pm.  \n\nYou be the judge, or pay and see for yourself.
