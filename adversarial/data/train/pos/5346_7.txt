BCCC is located in an older building behind Tower of Jewels.  It's not fancy, or well decorated inside, but it is well organized, and clean.  There were only three other patients there when I came in, which was kind of weird, because similar establishments in town tend to be packed.\nI filled out some paperwork, and was taken in for my appointment right on time.  Due to some complications, my procedure required some extra time, and effort from the medical staff.  It also required an ultra sound.  I wasn't charged extra for any of it, although it isn't something that's generally needed.  I still only paid the flat rate, which was less than half of what a-z, and planned parenthood quoted me.  The doctor, and nurse that I had were both great.  Very professional, and caring.  They were great at making me feel comfortable, and answering questions. I would not hesitate to come back.
