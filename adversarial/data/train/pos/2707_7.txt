Well, you had me at fried chicken. Who doesn't like chicken? especially fried chicken? It's something that I will always have love-hate relationship with. Why must they be so delicious yet packed with so much calories? Cause life is unfair, you can't have everything.\n\nAnyways, Paulette's Original has been open for couple months now and I finally jumped on the bandwagon to check it out. It is close enough to where I live, yet I don't go east of DVP much to venture out for food. But it was the long weekend and I couldn't think of a better time to drop by and see what all the fuss was about.\n\nPaulette's Original is a small store so it's easy to miss even with it's bright mint colored store front.\n\nOnce I walked in, I was greeted with 2 girls dressed in diner style uniforms. How cute is that? thanks for making me feel so unattractive with my bare face and asian framed glasses, hmph.\n\nSince this place is strictly designed for take out only, there are just few chairs along the window (assuming it's for people to sit and wait for their food).\n\nThere is nothing to be confused or cry over what you want to order at Paulette's Original, it's either chicken or donuts! Since I was getting take out for my family, I decided to get 2 of Combo Chicken and some donuts to try everything they got.\n\nOrdered: Combo Chicken #1 3\/5\n\n* 2 pieces white, 2 pieces dark, dipping sauce or rub & 1 small side for $14.95\n* I picked honey mustard dipping sauce and Mac n Cheese as a side\n* I read so many reviews on how crispy the batter is for their chicken\n* Indeed, chicken had very crispy batter which I loved\n* Chicken wasn't hot since it was probably fried in the morning\n* But it was still very juicy and tender\n* Batter had seasoning in it, so I found dipping sauce to be unnecessary\n* Honey mustard dipping sauce was made with grainy mustard\n* I couldn't really tell which pieces were dark\/white\n* Mac n Cheese was a huge disappointment\n* Pasta was over cooked, so it was too soft almost very mushy in texture\n* Cheese sauce was bland and didn't have any flavor\n\nOrdered: Combo Chicken #2 3\/5\n\n* I picked Tandoori BBQ dipping sauce and Rapini + Butternut squash salad as a side\n* I thought Tandoori BBQ dipping sauce would be an interesting mix\n* Yes, it was interesting but I didn't think it went well together\n* It was very heavy with 2 flavors and it didn't work for me\n* Rapini + Butternut squash salad was very refreshing\n* But it didn't do anything as a side\n* Overall the sides were quite disappointing\n\nOrdered: Cornbread 2\/5\n\n* 1 pieces of cornbread for $2.95\n* My parents love cornbread so I ordered one as a side\n* This is made with chopped up red peppers and more\n* Overall it was a savory corn bread\n* I prefer regular corn bread over the savory kind\n\nOrdered: Fancy Donuts 4\/5\n\n* Full size donuts, 7 different flavors a day, $2.75 each\n* I ordered Mojito, Raspberry Rose and Cinnamon Latte\n* Even for 'fancy donuts', I found $2.75 a little too expensive for a donut\n* Their donuts reminded me of denser Krispy Kreme donuts\n* Very soft and overall shortcake like texture throughout\n* Mojito donut was a little too sour for me but it did taste like mojito\n* I found the Raspberry Rose donut to be a little too sweet for me\n* I personally liked the Cinnamon Latte donut the best\n* Cinnamon Latte was probably the most regular flavored donut out of 3\n\nSummary: Throughout my meal- I couldn't help but think about what the difference was between their chicken and fast food franchise chicken (KFC, Popeyes..). Don't get me wrong! the chicken was good, but I didn't find it to be anything special. Were the donuts delicious? Yes it was, but did it blow my mind? Nope. I am glad I gave Paulette's orginal a try before the hype died down...but the question is, would I go back just to get their chicken and donuts. I highly doubt it.
