The people who work the late shift here deserve a medal. Or holiday. Or the biggest hug ever. Seriously, how would you feel if you were at work and an army of blackout drunk people stormed into your office? They deal with it every Friday and Saturday night.\n\nI'll be honest... I'm usually not sober when I end up here. I'll make fun of the other drunk people and act like I'm completely fine. I dunno if anyone buys it.\n\nMy go-to order is the buffalo chicken loaded with some type of combination of mushrooms, jalapenos, banana peppers, insert whatever veggie I'm feeling and a bunch of tzatziki. \n\nI usually take it to go so I can eat it at home in pajamas. However, if you can snag a seat sit and stay for the show of the endless parade of the inebriated.\n\nI have to give props to the workers here. They handle it all in stride and are pretty good sports about everything. Don't be discouraged by a long line. Pita Pit can pump orders pretty quickly so they wait is never all that long. If you want to avoid the madness, make sure you get here before 2am to get there before the rush.
