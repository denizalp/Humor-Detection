5 stars for a fast and high quality breakfast that was close to our hotel in downtown Calgary! We were looking for breakfast sandwiches and outdoor seating and Holy Grill checked off all boxes.\n\nA little more on the fast casual side, you can order up at the grill and then your food gets delivered to the table. On a Friday morning there was plenty of available seating outside. We caught the tail end of breakfast - at 11 am the grill menu switches over from breakfast to lunch! \n\nI ordered a bacon egg and cheese on an english muffin and it was perfect, simple and delicious. I also threw in a side of home fries which came with frizzled onions and parm cheese - interesting way to serve them but delicious nonetheless. The breakfast paninis looked tasty but way too big for breakfast, I'm glad that I stuck with a sandwich. \n\nNot much more to say because this is a quick and easy trip, but I highly suggest for breakfast or lunch if you want a fast and delicious breakfast or lunch.
