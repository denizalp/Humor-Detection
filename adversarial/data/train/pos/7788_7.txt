How could you not like an airport that has slot machines? Didn't lose all of your money at the casino? Don't worry, you still have time here. Now, who do I need to speak with about getting some blackjack tables added?\n\nThe other big bonus here: the people watching. It may be the best airport for it. Why? Well, there's really two sides of the spectrum here. The people who arrive are the happiest and most excited folks on the plane. Those who are leaving, look kind of like a scene from the walking dead. Between this and gambling, you've got plenty to keep you entertained if your flight gets delayed. \n\nThere are plenty of charging stations throughout the airport. If you're a smoker, there's an enclosed slot machine lounge. Smoke 'em if you got 'em. Plenty of shopping and food options. There's a tram to take you between terminals. \n\nUntil next time, Vegas.
