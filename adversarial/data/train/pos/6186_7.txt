Good for a full course dinner!  Especially when there is shrimp and steak.\n\nNot good for lunch, where selection isn't really that great..  You know where there's a lot of food but nothing to really eat?  Like opening your fridge, seeing all the food, but shutting it anyway.  That's what lunch felt like.\n\nAlso, I definitely don't think it's worth waiting in line.  \n\nRecommended for: No lines + dinner [without high expectations] + lots and lots of hungry guys\/girls + affordable price.
