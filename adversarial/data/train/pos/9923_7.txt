Palace Station really isn't so bad at all. \n\n- Plenty of parking, whether ground level or in their little parking garage.\n- Rooms aren't brand new or fancy, but they were definitely clean and suitable for what you pay for.\n- Starbucks right across the (slow) elevators, so you could dip down for a morning coffee and head back up.\n- There's Oyster Bar! If you're staying at this hotel, there's no reason why you shouldn't be down here at 7AM beating the lines for seafood! \n\nI always enjoy coming here. It's nothing fancy, but it's a good time for good value.
