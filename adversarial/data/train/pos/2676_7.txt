If you're looking for a new dentist, check these guys out.  As soon as you walk in the door, you feel good.  It's clean, modern and everyone is so nice.  Beth (front desk girl) was so nice on the phone, and in person - even nicer!  Michael is the one that helps you if you have any questions - also really nice.  And Dr. Koerperick is also, of course, really nice and a terrific dentist.  All in all - amazing place to switch to if you're looking for a dentist!  Great job, guys!
