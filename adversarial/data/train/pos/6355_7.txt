No stars the meat is cold dry  enhance the taste of chemicals not wood the sauce all 5 6 7 of them are absolutely hideous not a one tasted good they're baked beans are horrible mashed potatoes aren't any good either and I love instant mash potato mash potato run over by a truck any kind of mash potato I like and these are horrible the macaroni and cheese has bread crumbs on them and I don't like that and they are way too expensive you better on two banks to go here if this is the way barbecue is in the Carolinas I never want to go they should name the place old meat not old Carolina have absolutely nothing good to say about this place the ribs from Sams Club are better than this and they bake them do yourself a favor and stay away from old Carolina it's a mistake hiding under a big corporate name the McRib is better look elsewhere not here buyer beware dry turkey dry brisket cold pulled pork what more can I say just stay away
