My overall rating for this place is 3.5 stars due to their pricing and selections.\n\nThe food is a tad bit overpriced and I felt the selections were a bit limited or I just didn't fancy the selections that were available. When I'm faced with that dilemma, I usually go with a steak.  \n\nI must admit, their American Wagyu steak (7oz) was amazing!! You would expect nothing less from a $90 steak!  I do recommend this steak if you are dining here.  If you are a fan of truffle, then I would suggest the artichoke puree with black truffles - that was yummy!  The side of spinach was too salty for my taste buds so I didn't have a good experience with that dish.  As for the appetizer, I was very happy with the foie gras prepared 3 ways.  It was DELICIOUS and left me wanting more!\n\nThe service was great and the decor was modern\/elegant.
