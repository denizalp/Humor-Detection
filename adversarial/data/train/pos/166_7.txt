Luck was on our side! We struck great service when we dined here around 2 am this past Saturday.  Our server, a lady with shoulder length dark wavy hair and a little on the plump side, was friendly, helpful and attentive.  I ordered hot water and clam chowder.  My clam chowder arrived hot and had plenty of cubed potatoes and clam meat.  It was also not overly salty or creamy.  The clam chowder was filling and satisfying. I also had a taste of my friend's chicken tenders and it was also not overly salty! The crunch was perfect and the chicken meat was moist. \n\nI'm glad this cafe is open 24 hours because I plan to come back when I get a late night craving for soup or chicken tenders!  The price was reasonable for the portion and taste.\n\nWould be back!
