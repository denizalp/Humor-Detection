I'm with Jason C. on this one.  Given the price for the cheeseburger I bought, I was a little \"Meh,\" about it.  It did taste pretty good; it was pretty bomb but it I've had cheaper and better.\n\nThe fries, yeah, are pretty damn good too.  \n\nThe decor is alright.  The line to get your food and the actual dining area is divided by sacks of potatoes.  Yes, it's tacky but I thought that was cool.\n\nOh, and free peanuts.\n\nIf you ride a bike, DO NOT use the bike rack right out in front.  Don't do it.  You see all that bird shit everywhere?  If you, for one minute, assume that you're not gonna get shit on, you are incorrect.  I was lazy so I chanced it.  Unlocking my bike to go home, BULL'S EYE.  I got poop right on my eyebrow.  Gross.\n\nThis is a decent place.  It's worth trying out if you're in the area of if you're curious.  Three stars, I like it but I'm not crazy about it.
