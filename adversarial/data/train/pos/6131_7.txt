The last time I was at Times Square it wasn't the best, so when my friends said they are headed back there for a birthday dinner celebration I was very tempted to just say I can't join you, but I didn't and set off to meet them on a Sat night.\n\nWe were a party of 8, and I have to say, service was delightful, I wish I remembered her name, she was quick witted, polite and just fun to have around, she made sure our cups were always filled and that we didn't want for anything.\n\nAfter checking out the menu, I went with the Fettuccine Della Casa, it was fettuccine noodles in a white creamy sauce with mushrooms, peas and bacon, and let me tell you, even with the peas, this dish was delish! I almost licked my plate clean haha. So good!\n\nFor dessert I went with the Cream Brulee, I don't know about you, but I live for the sound of the sugar cracking and that's exactly what this did! Perfectly browned sugar and great tasting vanilla custard, I do love a good Cream Brulee! \n\nHappy this turned out to be a good evening!
