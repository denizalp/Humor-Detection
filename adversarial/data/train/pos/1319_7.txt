If you haven't eaten at Diego Pops yet then you are probably not that cool..  All the cool kids are def eating here so if you're trying to score some cool points then you know what to do.   Brittany was my server and she's obvi the best...  Ask her for Sangria it's her fave drink to deliver and it's now my go to here...
