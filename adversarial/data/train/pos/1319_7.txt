If someone could harness the power of Ansel Adams turning in his grave from this gallery, we could stop importing oil from the middle east tomorrow.\n\nPassing this gallery and watching people talk about spending tens of thousands on a print of one of Jeff's pictures made me cry inside. And if at any point Jeff tried submitting his pictures to National Geographic or any reputable travel magazine, I'm sure I'm in good company. While some of his pictures aren't bad, the majority are derivative and bland. You can find similar (and better) quality shots on postcards or browsing flickr. The one feature that stands out best about this collection of cliche landscape pictures is the price: not even the masters would charge $30,000 for a reprint.\n\nThe worst part is that almost every picture suffers from amateur-hour post processing, resulting in extremely oversaturated colors and blown out highlights. Jeff clearly had thousands of dollars and entire months to spend on capturing his pictures in the first place, so it boggles the mind why he couldn't find the few hours necessary to correct minor technical issues like these. Ultimately, it speaks to the essence of what this gallery is about: not good photography, but extraordinary commercial exploitation.\n\nSome examples of landscape photography done right: http:\/\/www.luminous-landscape.com\/techniques\/cycling.shtml
