Just say NO to this dealership. Twice I've come in to take advantage of their sales ad, and twice they have pulled a bait and switch. Most recent interaction was exactly the same as the previous one. \n\n\" I saw your ad for $10000 off, do you have any of the sales cars in stock?\"\n\"Yes...do you know which car you are interested in?\n\"Yes...this one (shows ad from their website)\" \n\"Great I'll bring it around\"\n\nCar that shows up is different. I decline and am only interested in the exact car I showed them. But now that car isn't on sale...in fact the \"list\" price is $3000 more than advertised price or msrp price.\n\nIt's a gimmick, a scam, a waste of time and money. Sales people are never the same as of 3 months prior, can barely speak English, and obviously untrained so it's better to deal directly with the money guy. \n\nTrust me...no deals here. If you are ok paying $3000 or more over msrp than by all means shop here. There are better dealerships than Towbin or Prestige.
