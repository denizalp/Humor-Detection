Update.\n\nSo I braved the parking again and actually tried this place.  I figured I had to try this place as pastry is what I do. :-)\n\nIt was ok. The concept is cute. And they finally got a sign!!!!!!! \n\nEdible menu was just rice paper with Raspberry Sauce.  I guess if you've never seen rice paper it's amazing but I see it all the time so nothing special for me. It would have been nice if the sugar ring was flavored and not just pulled sugar. \n\nOrange Sorbet.... too much air worked into it.  Otherwise, the flavor was good. \n\nI had the Angel something.  It was good and very pretty. Flavor wise....I wished that the pear flavor was more forward.  It was light and creamy but really nothing stood out. \n\nAlso had the strawberry Tiramisu. This one was much better.  More forward flavors and it felt like a complete dessert with the different textures in the dessert.  The cake part of it was my fav. :-)\n\nThey called it hot cream puff but I guess I like my cream puffs a little softer.  This one was rock hard.  The chocolate custard had just the right amount of bitterness to it but the blueberry jam inside threw me.  I would have just preferred it to me plain chocolate. \n\nWould I come back.  No. Was it a good experience to have yes. \n\n~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nThis review is just based solely on parking and the lack of signage for the restaurant.  \n\nOk. If this was a brand new restaurant I could understand why there are no signs for the restaurant.  BUT really??  They can't spend the money to put a sign up to let their first time patrons know where they are located?????  Really????\n\nAnd seriously, parking or rather the lack there of parking? What's the deal?  You can't let your first time patrons know that parking is bloody murder? To add on at least 30 minutes to try and get parking or tell them to park at another plaza and walk over?  Is that so hard to let people know? \n\nI called to ask them where they are located while I was sitting in front of Raku(which had a sign). The girl on the phone laughed and said yes no sign like that was a good thing... and then when I mentioned the parking she just laughed again and said to just drive around and look for parking.  Nice.  No help at all just a lot of laughter.\n\nThis pretty much makes me not ever want to try this place.  If I ever do want to face the parking again I will update this review with what I thought of the food. From what I read... mixed reviews.
