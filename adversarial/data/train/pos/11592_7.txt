The most popular in-n-out in the LV by far! Though there are often long lines they've figured out how to turn that into only modestly long waits. Pro tip: when you pull in head straight to see the line for drive-thru. It's not a counter clockwise rotation like most other spots. Also, there is plenty of parking (they own the building and lot next door too) so if you can't stand the wait, head on in. There will probably still be peeps in there, but at least you can fill up some ketchup cups while you wait. If you still choose to eat in your car, they give you placemats for your lap, so no worries about getting some animal sauce leakage on the pants. Speaking of animal sauce leakage, get this on everything. Fries and burger alike. Then again, you know the hype, you see the reviews, do you! A solid fast food burger awaits you any which way you order. Enjoy!
