This place has broken me, as I quite literally can't eat a burrito anywhere else now.\n\nHands down the best red or green chile this side of Albuquerque. \n\nI could literally create an entire lifestyle around eating these things. Sure, I would be dead of gout in a few years, but it would be totally worth it.\n\nIf you read any negative reviews on this place, they are all from Gringos, complaining that their \"California burrito\" wasn't up to their expectations. (Hint, if you are ordering a \"California Burrito\" your credibility as a food reviewer is pretty much shot) \n\nReally, from someone who actually knows what Mexican food is supposed to taste like (Hint #2, it's not supposed to taste like a cob salad wrapped in a tortilla), don't listen to any of these uncultured nitwits. \nThis is the real deal. \nOh, and you know why they charge for extra salsa, fatty? \nBecause it is that good. \nComing from a world renowned salsa master, that is something. \n\nThis is the best spot for a burrito in the entire valley, but, I will warn you, don't do the green chile if you don't have the cojones to go all in, because it will put you down if you underestimate it.\n\n\nUpdate:\nApparently Gringos with no taste get offended when there is a good review of a restaurant across the street from a more trendy place. Don't get me wrong, that other place is okay, but just because Guy Fieri ate there, doesn't mean their tacos are worth waiting in a 30 minute line for.....\n\nOh, and if the Red Chile here was not good, then you literally have no tastebuds......
