Got on guest list. Said it would be reduced cover charge for guys. Tickets online for guys were $50. We get to the club and even with the Guys being on guest list, it was NOT a reduced price. It was even more. $70! Never coming back here again. Just for the false information. We wasted our time in line for nothing, and the lady at the ticket booth was rude and tried arguing with me when I asked her why ticket prices were even higher. All the guys around us (that we didn't know) were also pissed cause they were told it was only going to be $40. Shady club.
