This review is for a *wedding* held at Pioneer Living History Museum that I attended. \n\nParking\/Accessibility:\n-one large dirt parking lot, only available parking. I believe there are some handicapped parking spots near the entrance.\n-meandering sidewalks\/pathways are used to traverse the acreage, but alot of the terrain is just dirt (noted for those in wheelchairs, etc). You will need to walk approximately 1\/2-3\/4 of a mile to get all the way back to the chapel-- prepare to sweat.\n-for those who need transportation directly to the chapel, there is a small access road that leads back to the church, but vehicles will need to be parked to the side after unloading.\n-there is only one set of bathrooms that I was made aware of. There is no sidewalk directly to the bathrooms from the Opera House, sidewalk goes out in front of entrance and around to the bathrooms. This caused problems when it was pouring rain for people who were in wheelchairs.\n\nChapel:\n-quaint and small \"old-west\" chapel, can seat at least 100 people from my estimate.\n-elevated altar area, great for showcasing the whole wedding party.\n-some flower\/wedding decor in place year round (bannister flowers, aritificial arrangements)\n-large windows on both sides of the chapel allow ample sunlight, somewhat blinding as the sun is beginning to set.\n-uncomfortably warm, with only airflow from vents on the exterior walls (we stood in front of them to cool down).\n\nOpera House:\n-small \"mud room\" entrance, where appetizers and dinner was served buffet style, as well as where the bar and NA drinks were stationed. A bit cramped.\n-doors were blowing open and slamming shut (due to the storm outside), nearly knocked several people over, including myself.\n-just a rumor I heard, but beware of bats. Make sure the manager\/event coordinator has cleared the area prior to your guests' arrival.\n-no bathrooms\n-small patio area out front with benches, is not well protected in the event of rain.\n-interior of opera house rather small, but with high ceilings and a stage (for DJ, lights, etc).\n-can fit approximately 8-10 round rables with 8 chairs at each table.\n\nFood and Drink:\n-the appetizers (Babybel cheese, crackers, fruits) were tasty and were ready upon arrival.\n-bartender was stationed upon arrival, she was really sweet. There was a \"margarita fountain\" that literally tasted like there was no tequila in it. I had 5-6 glasses without a buzz. Also had champagne, beer and wine. \n-complimentary NA drinks (water, tea, lemonade) with ice were available for self-service.\n-dinner (catered by Pioneer Village) was spectacular. There was salad, rolls with butter, mashed potatoes and corn, and a choice of beef brisket or pulled pork. BBQ optional. \n\nStaff:\n-as I said before, the bartender was very friendly and polite. But the manager\/event coordinator, who I assumed worked for Pioneer Village was rather rude. My fiance got very sick prior to the wedding ceremony and left the chapel. As he had been gone a long time, I peeked by head out to check on him and was bluntly told to \"go back inside.\" \n-additionally, as I went to use the women's restroom, I noted that there was a male maintenance worker inside. I announced myself to him, he left, and then came back in when I was in the bathroom stall. I believe this was a mistake on his part, thinking I'd left, and he promptly exited again.\n\nI'd recommend this venue for a wedding, their catered food was awesome and overall, the buildings are in good shape. However, I'd recommend it for a fall\/winter\/spring wedding, and seriously consider who will be coming and if Pioneer Village will be easy for them to navigate.
