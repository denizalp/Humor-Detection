With over 1500 reviews (mostly 5 star), this is no longer a secret.   When you come here, there will certainly be a long line, but it moves fairly quickly.  The reason is simple:  this is a solid lunch or after-club option for cheap eats.   Their sandwiches are about $7, their hot sandwiches are very flavorful, and their meats are great.  \n\nTheir full montague is their most popular sandwich.  I've also tried their carribean jerk, which has a mild spice to it.  This visit, I tried their seasonal turkey sandwich, which had stuffing and cranberry sauce.  The turkey was moist and it was just a well made sandwich.\n\nThese are flavor-packed sandwiches and a solid option for cheap eats in the middle of the strip.  If you're looking for other cheap eats on the strip, I'd recommend that you venture to the \"Secret Pizza\" place in Cosmopolitan, to Chipotle by Harrah's, and to the food court at Excalibur (where you can find Quiznos, McD, Pizza Hut, Krispy Kreme, and Baja Fresh sans markup).  On the other side of town, then you could go to Circus Circus, Tacos El Gordo, or the Fashion Show Mall for budget eats.  (Downtown is a different story altogether), \n\nHowever....in looking at this list....Earl of Sandwich, Tacos El Gordo, and the Secret Pizza place are clear standouts and you should consider checking them out if you're looking to seek great food options under $10.
