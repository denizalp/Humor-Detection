Total waste of time and money. The only reason it got 2 stars was because the back up dancers were great and salvaged the poor performance of Britany. I would describe Britany's performance as awful. Her dancing was more like a shuffle and her lip singing was so obvious. At times I felt like I was watching a Saturday Night live skit. The worst was when she was riding a giant guitar like a oversized wiener  during I love rock and roll song. It even spurted out fireworks as it \"came\" to the end of the song.  I was so looking forward to this show and it was such a let down. To top things off a woman in my row was totally passed out unconscious and my wife had to climb over her in heals and a dress while staff stood by and did nothing. The onlooking staff apologized but did not remove her drunk passed out butt.
