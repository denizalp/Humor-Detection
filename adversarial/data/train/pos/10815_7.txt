Well! I booked a table for 2 at 6pm for Winterlicious very very last-minute. Luckily, we were the 2nd last table, I didn't think I'd be able to book one for such a popular time too. On the night of, we were late and I had to push the time to 6:30. She very politely allowed that.\n\nSo... I usually have alright things to say about Winterlicious restaurants. Food is alright, portions alright, service alright. If the restaurant is terrible, I don't even write a review for them.\n\nBut oh here! We were well taken care of. It was a bit cramped though, I didn't like being so close to the other tables. The food wasn't too small, the steak was wonderful, and the desserts were really great too. \n\nI also had a Freezie Martini $7.95 (Raspberry Sour Puss, Banana Liqueur, 7-UP) and it's my favourite now. The restaurant is dimly lit, with romantic by-the-window tables, and many group-size tables. There's lots of energy around you... usually just the friendly waiters making their guests laugh.\n\nOur waiter was so awesome. My boyfriend ordered the same dessert as me, and the waiter jokingly said, \"Don't you want something different to share?\" and then looked to me, \"Gotta watch them straight boys.\" HAHAHAHA!!!!
