The Good:  Plenty of parking in this strip mall 24.  It seems older, not only the equipment, building, and clients but it has a large single floor design that is spaced out and more towards my liking.  Plenty of equipment, without somebody standing right right next to you.\n\nThe Bad:  Is this the senior 24 Hour Fitness?  Where did all the women go?\n\nThe Ben:  Even though there is not eye-candy here I really like the floor layout and this would be the gym I would go to if I was living in Vegas.
