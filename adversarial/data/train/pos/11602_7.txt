these people are fantastic. you can walk in with absolutely zero knowledge of firearms and they are glad to offer help to you and your particular wants\/needs. i will admit i felt a little intimidated when i walked in due to bad experiences at other guns shops but that changed immediately as i was greeted with smiling faces the moment i walked through the doors. the best part is they dont try telling you what you need but rather give full of knowledge of the firearm youre interested in and their opinion if they think it will suit you.\n\nhighly recommended!
