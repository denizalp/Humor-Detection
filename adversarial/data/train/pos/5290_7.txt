My youngest daughter and I stopped in here after spotting it as we were driving by with an eye peeled for something for dinner that was:\n\n1. Not fast-food.\n2. Not a chain.\n\nI consider Mimita's a find.  Service from our waiter Ty was very good.\n\nHe answered many questions that my daughter had and helped ease her comfort level about Cuban food.\n\nWe started with papas rellenas which are essentially big balls of mashed potato that are filled with creole ground beef, rolled in some light coating and fried.  So fried meat n' potatoes.  Tasty.\n\nNext we shared a sandwich, the pan con lechon.  It was pulled pork, sauteed onion and mayo in fresh bread.  Also quite tasty and large enough to share.\n\nWe finished it off by sharing an order of dulce de leche.  Wow. It is not a very large dessert but the 2 of us could barely finish it, it was so rich.  Great caramel flavors with wholesome vanilla and cinnamon, perhaps a hint of rosewater or something else.\n\nPrices are good.  Our app, sandwich and dessert cam to about $20.
