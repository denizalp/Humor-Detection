I Like not LOVE!!!\n\nI came in last week and I will say this place is sooo much bigger and shinier!! They sat us right away and we entered the second dining room with the garage doors! Very cool, and yet a little too cold inside maybe the heat wasn't working all that well but still I can see the appeal to sitting here on a nice day\/night out!! \n\nWe started with the Waffle fries with Pimento- Soo Good!! The fries were cooked perfectly with just the right amount of cheese on top!! I then moved on and had the Pterodactyl Burger with Cheese and Bacon- Meh it was good but the one at the Penquin was better (could've been the grease from all the years)!! I also had the Hotdog with just Sauerkraut-Good!  My Man Friend had the Buffalo Shrimp Tacos- Also Good! \n\nThe service was just like it was at the Penguin and Im glad! It wasn't like some restaurants you go to and your server really hasn't a clue as to whats going on, so I was happy that everyone felt at ease with this new place just as much as I did. I will be back soon and look forward to trying other things on the menu!
