The place seemed pretty nice at first -- but then that's more the Old Port ambiance, I think.  \n\nThe hostess was always nice.  The other waiters (manager\/owner included?) didn't seem to care.  We waited to order -- and many of the meat dishes weren't available off the bat -- we waited for our soups, we waited for more water, we waited for the main course.  They were prompt with the bill, at least -- in fact, they asked if we were ready for it before we got our meal!\n\nReally, the only saving grace is the food itself -- the lobster was very good, and the scallops didn't suck.  But that may have just been because we were that hungry after waiting for it so long.\n\nOf course, scallops was my second choice -- after the list of other unavailable dishes, I tried ordering the steak tartare, only to be told the chef was \"too busy\" to make that.  Wait, what?\n\nAnd the reason for the poor service -- gratuity is automatically added to the bill, even for small parties.  After overhearing some of the other customers complaining about that and the service, we were able to get it taken off to leave a proper (for our experience) tip.  And no customary offer to split the check any.\n\nWhile waiting for them to take our money, I noticed the hostess trying to sell a young couple into the restaurant.  I've never had to resist so hard the urge to loudly channel Admiral Ackbar.
