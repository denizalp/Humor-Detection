If you ever wondered what it might be like to live the good life and be filthy rich, you can start by visiting The Chandelier to sip on one of their elegant cocktails and enjoy the view from inside biggest chandelier I've ever seen in my life! Settle into a comfy couch, bask in the pink lighting, relish the fancy flavors, and pretend it's your everyday life. I make a stop here every time I'm in Vegas! \n\n3 Levels to Drink:\nThat's right, three floors of awesome! Each floor is open at a different hours of the day, and different floors serve different specialty cocktails. The third level is open in the mornings, the second level opens at 6pm, and the bottom level (casino floor level) is always open!\n\nDrinks & Pricing:\nYou pay for the Vegas life you live. Be forewarned: drinks are expensive. They run $16 per signature cocktail and a couple dollars cheaper for glasses of wine and such. If you're looking for a vodka-cran or some other basic type of drink, just find a different bar because it won't be worth the price you pay here. That being said, they have some great cocktails worth stopping by for!\n\nPro-Tip #1: It's not on the menu, but if you visit the 2nd floor bar and ask for a Fireside Delight, they'll make you this DELICIOUS s'more martini that's AWESOME.\n\nPro-Tip #2: If by chance you don't finish your drink by the time you're ready to leave, ask the bartender for a plastic cup & take your leftover drink to-go! Don't let the rest of that expensive drink go to waste! It's Vegas, carry that drink around like you own the place! \n\nService:\nMinus star for this one. I don't know if it's that I look young by mainland standards or if I don't look like I'm ballin' outta control, but waitresses tend to give me awful service here. The bartenders, on the other hand, have all been relatively friendly!
