Ok so who goes from California to Scottsdale and ends up at a Sprinkles? That would be ME. \n\nIn search for a cute independently owned cupcakery to test how AZ cupcakes stack up to SF Bay cuppies... we headed to downtown Scottsale. WELL, not really for the cupcakes, but just to check it out. However, seeing there were a handful of cupcakeries nearby, we had to try one.\n\nBUT the reviews of 2 and 3 stars for some of these places seriously put me off. I hate dry cupcakes and I was not eager to spend precious calories on something that would not satisfy. Sprinkles had the better reviews and whala it was open after all the other places closed. (Note to self, who closes a bakery at 6pm? Cupcake freaks come out at NIGHT!)\n\nWe have a Sprinkles about a 15 min drive from us@home, but have I ever gone??? NO. So yes here we are at Sprinkles in AZ. The gals are friendly, they answer my questions tirelessly. I end up with 2, lemon and chocolate marshmallow.\n\nThey stay overnight in our hotel room since our dinner left absolutely no room for cupcakes. I was worried they'd be dry and stale the next morning when I busted them out at 7am before my workout. Gotta get some carbs in so I can burn them off right?\n\nBottom line... Sprinkles may not be a cute little indy shop any longer but their stuff is solid. No mixes, the dark chocolate cupcakes are the perfect combo of dark, bitter, and sweet. The lemon was dense, I think mine is better, but the chocolate marshmallow OMG. It was like a grownup version of a Hostess cupcake, MY FAVORITE. Despite their overnight rest, they were not dry, the result of a fair amount of oil if the residue on my fingers was any indication.\n\nPlease send me three dozen of the Chocolate Marshmallow please. I will love you forever. Thanks.
