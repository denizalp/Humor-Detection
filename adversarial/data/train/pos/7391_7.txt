Oh how sweet it is to have a Chinese place that's open seconds from home.\n\nThis place is tiny, and only take out or delivery. By far the fastest service. Pick up is ready in 10minutes. No lie. Every time we have parties at my place, we feed the hungover folks with this the next day and it's ready within minutes. \nTo be frank, the thought of how fast it's ready scares me. But also makes my tummy quite happy. win win?\nAlso, open on every major holiday. xmas and New Years included ^_^\n\nMy go to order\n\ndinner for two: $17.95\n2 egg rolls - not the greatest.
