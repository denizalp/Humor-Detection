They need a better rain policy.  Standing in an exit line... i mean mob with 7 kids in lightning and pouring rain is not only unsafe but inhumane.  You want us to wait in the rain for 15 to 45 mins to see if it stops raining before we can get a return pass... really?!?! Why do you really need to retrieve an armband in the midst of a monsoon storm?!? Tacky corporate greed... Get a clue Golfland.  Very disappointing first experience!
