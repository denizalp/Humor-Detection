The Miracle Mile Shops are located inside the Planet Hollywood Resort and Casino. Why Miracle Mile? I guess because the enclosed mall is actually spans 1.2 miles that consists of 200 shops, restaurants and entertainment venues.  Walking through the mall, I saw a merchandise store that sold merchandise\/memorabilia to performers at the Zappo's Theater, such as JLo, Brittany Spears and the Backstreet Boys. \n\nIf you're an AAA member, show your AAA card at the information center for a free coupon book for discounts to shops and restaurants in the mall.\n \nBut we were here on a mission to get some Garrett's Popcorn from Chicago that has a store in the mall.  The AAA coupon book has a coupon for a sample popcorn bag and check in on Yelp for a bottle of water. \n\nA nice mall on the Strip!
