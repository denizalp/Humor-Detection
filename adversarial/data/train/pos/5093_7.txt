I stayed here for an event at the Las Vegas Convention Center. Fellow convention goers beware! Wi-Fi does not work and cell phone coverage is terrible. Even the television barely works if you can get the remote to change channels. This toe fungus of a hotel is not suited for business in any form.\n\nAesthetically the place is a total cornhole, the lobby looks like it's maintained by an 80+ aged crew and the carpet is disgusting. I recommend shoes when walking around this place especially if you're coming from or going to the pool. It attracts a much younger, ghetto and less experienced Vegas crowd due to its lower prices, with this also comes a less quality employee crew however.\n\nI booked my room 3 months in advance thinking \"how bad could this place be for 1 night\", cheap and close to the Convention Center. I get into the line and I'm told I could use the \"express check-in\" by 2 attendants. It didn't work for me so the attendant checked my room which wasn't ready so she changes my room, OK there's a little bit of \"service\" there I thought.\n\nI get to the tower and it already smells like a donkey farm, the elevator seemed like something out of a Final Destination movie. Once I get on the floor there's phone books in front of the doors all along the hallway to my room I'm thinking \"is this the prostitute path or something\"? I get to my room which smells like smoking monkeys had been living in it, the ashtrays confirmed it was a smoking room. \n\nI call the front desk who helps me out with a \"regular\" non smoking room which was better. However feel free to look at my pictures from the room (e.g. the neverending toilet, the \"beautiful\" views and the mystery wet spot).
