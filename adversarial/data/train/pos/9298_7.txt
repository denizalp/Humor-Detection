Wow so cool!!! We opted to come here since we wanted to check out some local events. We were staying in downtown Phoenix and it took us about 30 mins to drive here. Open until 10pm supposedly, we decided to make the trek. It was a weeknight so there wasn't a lot of people, which made it more fun because we got to really look at the pumpkins and talk to some vendors. \n\nThis garden is in the middle of a shopping center (so don't expect an actual pumpkin garden). Lots of parking surrounding the garden and you can walk the paths that leads to you lifelike pumpkin heads all around. I just wished there was more lighting. It was hard to see out after 9pm. \n\nThere are a couple of food trucks and a beer garden for the adults. You can even walk around with your beer. The staff and those who volunteered were all very friendly and nice. If you are in the area during Halloween season definitely check the garden out!
