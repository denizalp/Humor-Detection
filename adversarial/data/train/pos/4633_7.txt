I generally think that casinos offer the best buffets across the country (especially vegas) and the wandering horse buffet is no exception.\n\nI would highly recommend going for lunch during the week for around $12 as the best deal in the valley.  You get a few Asian options, a few grill options, Italian food (pizza and pasta), soups, salad, a few Mexican options, and a huge desert bar.  Of course, they have a carving station with 2 types of meat, and hot grill items which may include some steaks, burgers or pork chops.\n\nAt night they add a few more items such as crab legs or other seafood but it is around 90% of the same between lunch and dinner.  Also, check their website for theme nights as well.\n\nThey run keno on the TV screens in the dining area and have sports games playing at the bar in the center of the room.\n\nThe staff is very friendly and attentive and you can pretty much ask for anything you want and they will get it for you.  If you are into buffets, this is a great one.  If you lose a few bucks in the casino, I'll give you 50\/50 odds you can make your money back and the buffet!  ha ha
