There is no other place in Charlotte making frozen treats like this. \n\nMacaron ice cream sandwiches, yum-ee buns (aka donut ice cream sammies), cookie dough pops, crazy creative milkshakes (including cereal ones)- it all makes Charlotte feel so trendy in the ice cream world. If you're looking for a place to grab a cheap ice cream cone, this isn't it. Expect to pay more for the novelty. \n\nThe biggest surprise for me was how delicious the macaron was on my strawberry shortcake sandwich. It was actually better than a lot of ones I've gotten from local bakeries. Bravo Ninety's. \n\nIt's definitely worth the trip. Make sure to snap a pic before you dive in, these treats are totally 'Gram worthy.
