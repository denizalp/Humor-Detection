We went here for my bachelorette party and had a blast with my girls. Everyone in my party lost their voice from screaming. Not only are their moves sexy, the show itself was very entertaining and funny. Major props to Adam, the sexy MC!\n\nDefinitely a must see when going to Vegas! It was one of the biggest highlights of my bachelorette weekend. These men are smoking HOTTTT. I could not look them in the eye when talking to them. Thank goodness I was mostly drunk.\n\nWent to the bar downstairs afterwards to hang out with the guys and they bought us shots. They're all very friendly and down to Earth guys. 10 out of 10 would recommend friends to go see them.
