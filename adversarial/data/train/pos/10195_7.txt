No.  We went here, since we had a group of 8 and it was late on our first night in Vegas, and it was close.  What a mistake.  This place is so overpriced it is laughable.  Paid $23 for cheese tortellini with \"meat sauce\".  With that you get a salad, garlic bread, and their house wine (red wine vinegar, perhaps?).  My pasta had clearly been sitting in a vat too long, and there was no meat to be found in the sauce.  I could have done better with a bag of frozen pasta and a jar of Ragu, and I hate Ragu.\n\nSeriously, I don't know why anyone who reads these reviews would come here.  Dining in Vegas can be pricey and it can be bad, but at Battista's you get both in one visit.
