My husband and I recently had \"the best sushi of our lives\" and this place doesn't compare. As another reviewer said, it was pretty average. It's cute inside, very modern and upscale looking. The staff was very friendly and the service was fast. The menu is very large but it's really just reiterations of the same stuff. The location is decent but the parking lot is insane and very hard to find space since there are so many other businesses sharing the same lot.\n\nMy husband, my sister-in-law, and I arrived around 1:30pm on a Thursday and the place was pretty busy. We all ordered off the lunch menu - two of us ordered bento boxes and one ordered their lunch trio of sushi. We also ordered a fried pork belly appetizer to share. That was a mistake because it was literally just a bowl of rice with small bits of semi-crispy pork on top and half a hard boiled egg with slivers of green onion. For $5 it was ridiculous. (My bento was $9.50 and had WAY more food. The $5 price tag just didn't match up with taste\/quantity.) \n\nI ordered the salmon bento with edamame and a spicy tuna roll. The sushi was okay. It was what I expected - spicy tuna wrapped in rice. Very average and nothing special. The edamame was cold - not sure if intentional or an accident. The teriyaki salmon was the star. Very flavorful and cooked perfectly. I'd order more teriyaki salmon and be very happy.\n\nSis ordered the beef bento with goyza and a CA roll. She said the beef wasn't very good but everything else was fine.\n\nHubs ordered just sushi. He complained it was average and nothing compares to the \"best sushi\" he recently had. He also ordered a miso soup on the side (our bento boxes came with miso soup). I thought the miso was good, average but good.\n\nOverall, it was pretty average. For some cheap eats, check out their happy hour menu or go with a lunch bento. You can get full for under $10.
