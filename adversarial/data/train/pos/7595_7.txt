As I waited for the doors to open, because I wanted to visit this place that bad-I mean the name is awesome, I was greeted by the owner: Audrey. What a pleasant surprise!\n\nWalking in, we found ourselves in a hip, open and inviting space. Great selection of alcohol, with a nice pour. \n\nThursday's, Friday's, and Saturday's have a live DJ that gets the party started at 9:00 pm. \n\nAs of 12\/18, they are going to offer happy hour and will be open at 6:00 am.\n\nThis is definitely a place to visit! For the community, for the amazingness, come in and show your support.
