I had high hopes for Kung Fu Tea.   Another tea place opened up in my area and it was time to go check it out.   They had the BOGO promotion o and me and my friend decided to order the Mango Green Tea.   As advertised on their promotional picture,  there are big mango chunks in the poster and I expected it to be there.   The retail price of that is $5+tax.\n\nThe cashier took our order.  Everything went down from there.   He didn't even ask how much sugar and ice.   When the drink came and I realized it,  I asked them to redo it with less ice and less sugar and they refused.  Seriously?  Some people can die from diabetes.\n\nThe next part is the scam part on them.   When I got the drink,  I noticed that there was no mango chunks in there!  I asked the cashier where is the mango???  and his explanation was \"the picture is just for advertising\".    why even sell this drink if you are going to lie to your customers?  There is no mango chunks.  There were a few strands of mango in my drink and that was about it!\n\nIt is unbelievable that at this stage of the game, they are willing to scam their customers to save a few dollars on ingredient cost.   I will not go there again ever!
