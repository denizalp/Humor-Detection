Tried the basic Margherita pie; it is a small 16 inches (only one size available), and is, by design, millimeters thin at the center (the dough is pressed\/tossed far too thin to hold even sauce and cheese never mind any additional toppings or flavor). The crust is ok. Yes, the pizza is \"different\" than anything else you can really get in Charlotte and the craft is respectable. But, the pizza is just not impressive and it costs a truly unbelievable $18. For a pizza that you order at a counter (and are prompted to add a tip before you eat), and by their own suggestion is barely enough to feed one adult man. So your looking at potentially $18 per person minimum and you eat off paper plates at community tables. This is just insanely overpriced; maybe if the pizza was $12 I'd have a different feel but the pizza's not great, the place was overhyped by Charlotte Agenda, and is a terrible value to boot. Staff is extremely nice, but I definitely won't be back. (Removed any references to other [better] derivative styles of Neapolitan pizza because people take Yelp reviews super cereal).
