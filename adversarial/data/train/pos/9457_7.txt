Let me just cut straight to it. Hospital cafeteria food taste better than the sea bass and pasta I purchased this evening. Trust me, I work at one. Absolutely no seasoning. Chef boy would be considered gourmet compared to this pasta. On top of the terrible food, the server was horrific. Please save yourself your time and money. Go to Ruth's Chris or etc.... I don't even know how this place is still in business.
