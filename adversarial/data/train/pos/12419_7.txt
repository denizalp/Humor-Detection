All you can eat Meat. ALL YOU CAN EAT MEAT... and All You Can meat... did I say this place has all you can eat Meat... and oh ya... all you can eat Sushi too...\n\nBut really you come here for the All you can eat Meat because the Sushi is subpar at best. I would describe it as kind of like going to a Chinese Restaurant and ordering a Burger so you can have it but...you already know it wont be good. Haha!\n\nThis locations service is Much Much better than the location in Mississauga and the servers here are quick, attentive, and they bring out the food and drinks right after you order! I mean really how hard can it be to bring out Raw meat for you to cook yourself right?\n\nThey have plenty of Protein options such as Beef, Lamb, Chicken, Pork, Shrimp, Squid, Mussels, and tons of other items as well. O yea... they have veggies such as Zucchini, Bell Peppers, and Pineapples which are so yummy on the grill!\n\nI come here every single time to feed my Bodybuilder Style Arms and Legs after an intense workout or helping my friends move into another one of their 5 houses.  Come here if you need to bulk up and make sure you ear your $30 worth and make those servers work! Work! Work!
