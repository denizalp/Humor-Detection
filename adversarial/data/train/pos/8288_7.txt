When I go to Vegas, all I REALLY need from my hotel room is that the bed is clean and comfortable, clean working bathroom, blackout curtains, AC, and a mirror! If you're sitting in your hotel room watching TV or reading a book, then you're wasting your precious time in Vegas! That being said, Harrah's filled my basic hotel needs.\n\nThe Good:\n1) Super awesome location right in the middle of the strip!\n2) We somehow got our room for less than $100 a night without a resort fee when we booked online\n3) They gave us a late check-out without any extra charges\n4) They've got a bag check at the bell desk in case you've arrived before check-in time or won't be leaving immediately after check-out\n\nThe Bad:\n1) No fridge or wifi. It's because we had this deal and didn't have to pay the resort fee, but the room was missing something that I guess I've taken for granted at other hotels.\n2) The hotel overall was pretty mediocre. Other than to sleep & shower, we didn't spend any extra time in our own hotel as there is really nothing else to do besides gamble (and me & the bf don't really gamble).
