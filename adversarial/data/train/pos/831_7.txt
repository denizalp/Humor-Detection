Wow what a bummer!! We used to really love this place and would take people here all the time.\n\nThis last time the owner really dropped the ball by super inappropriately handling a situation, embarrassing our table and being confrontational over how a steak was cooked!\n\nBottom line is 4 dinners ordered, 2 steaks came in beyond rare, blue rare we will call it. Sent them back and assumed they would fire new steaks like most decent steakhouses would. They did not. They retired the same steaks (which had mushroom sauces all over them) and burnt them. They tasted like ass. So we told the waitress the deal, she went and talked to the owner and came back and said \"the owner is taking care of your meal and a new one will be out\". Cool. No problem, things happen.\n\nOut comes a perfect steak but unfortunately everyone was done eating. Took a few bites and put it in the to go box. We all know how awesome a reheated bone in ribeye is. Not.\n\nBill comes. Nothing taken off. Even charged more to add peopercorns to the steak! \n\nTold the waitress. She got the manager, Mandi. Who was about as helpful as boobs on a log. She literally said to us \"I came over because the owner doesn't like to deal with these situations and talk to people directly\". LOL! Wow. Ok Mandi, just take this off our bill. She couldn't and had to get the owner. This is where it got stupid.\n\nOwner comes over and is confrontational. Says the first steak should have been perfect since it was medium rare. Everyone at the table agreed it was rare beyond belief and cold in the middle! We weren't gonna agree so avoid having an argument with the owner on a Saturday evening!\n\n I just said \"look I wouldn't have waited to eat after everyone else did if the server didn't tell me you were taking care of it\". Then he told me basically why should I buy your steak if it finally came out great at the end. Uh....because you're in the f'n service industry jackass and I send people here all the time and live in the neighborhood. The whole table couldn't believe it.\n\nThey literally took the to go container we had with various leftovers, removed the Offending Ribeye in question and then gave it back and removed it from the tab. No apology, nothing.\n\nTip for the owner: Look up \"cost of doing business\" you lost 4 regulars last night that spend $300 each in your bars on a regular basis each month. Over a $10 food cost. As a business owner myself I think you're a damned idiot.\n\nWill be back, once, to use this groupon. Then we will start trying other places. If it's amazing the way it used to be next time I will put the review back how it was.
