Awesome food! Nice decor! Great service at the bar! Nice craft beers! Cool Vegas dining experience! All of this comes with a nice price tag, but you know that already as your in Vegas baby! Appetizers and drinks for 3 with a tip was about $125.00\n\nOne night after our conference we were searching for a cool place to chill in the MGM! My Yelpy friends guided us here and we loved it! \n\nWe ordered the French onion soup, sliders, shots, mixed drinks and beers. I don't recall what else went down as food was great and errr body in Crush was getting tipsy!\n\nFor us the staff was awesome as we sat at the bar and decor was somewhat posh lounge ish. I would return here if in back at the MGM and I hope you have as much as we did!
