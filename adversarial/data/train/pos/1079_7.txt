Had the 16 course meal.  By far the most epic restaurant dining experience I've ever had.  This place set a new standard for me.  \n\nHighlights:\n1.  30 minutes before our reservation, the restaurant calls and asks for our location so they can send their limo to pick us up.  Brings us through the back \"Mansion\" part of MGM (where Joel Robuchon and whales stay), with a mini tour\/pictures of the gardens, living areas, and stuff.\n2.  Restaurant is gorgeous.  Tasteful colors, themes, great environment for different types of dinner engagements.  \n3.  Service is excellent.  Waiter was attentive, but not intrusive.  Even had a pleasant voice and way of talking.  When we first sat down, apparently there was some drunk chick being a little loud at a table nearby that just left.  Our waiter comes by apologizing and asking if there's anything they can do.  I joke around about getting a free bottle of wine and they actually gave us one!  Not only that, they actually chose one that would go well with what we ordered.\n4.  16 course meal changed the way I view food.  It's not just about how good something tastes when it goes in your mouth.  But there was actually a progression of tastes and balances throughout the course of the meal.  Each next course complimented or contrasted really well with the previous one.  So much art and complexity in this meal.  \n5.  Chocolate cart is pretty amazing and I don't even like sweets.  But we already had too much to eat and drink by this point.  They gave us some boxes so we could take a bit of everything to go.\n6.  Dining experience took the whole night.  I think about 4 hours long.\n\nGoing into it, there was no way I would think a $1000 dinner would be worth it.  I changed my mind after.  \n\nThanks for an unforgettable experience, Joel Robuchon.
