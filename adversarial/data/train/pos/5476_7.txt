This week seems to be the week of \"I need a twenty minute meal.\" Twice this week I have walked into a place and asked: \"Do you think I can get my food and be outta here in twenty minutes? I have a meeting to get to.\"  Today, I was planning on running in Chipotle to grab a couple of tacos, but the place was overrun with UNLV students. There was no way I was going to have twenty-minute tacos there. I spotted a completely empty El Patio and decided this was promising.\n\nWalked in and stated my demands. They were agreeable. I asked for one chicken taco, and then realized I needed more. I ordered another, and then, the waiter suggested that I just get the lunch special with rice and beans for $6.50. I was an easy upsell, so I ended up with the whole sha-bang. \n\nThe meal came out quickly as promised, and I must say it was pleasing. The tacos were a little small, but fresh: warm, soft tortillas doubled up and filled with white-meat chicken. The chicken was not seasoned or swimming in sauce. The beans and rice were good, not greasy or heavy. The chips and salsa were not disappointing. It was the perfect little meal to get the job done.\n\nThe d√©cor and atmosphere are very simple. There are some classy college humor signs on the wall, including such gems as \"No shirts shoes skirt: no problem.\" The server was friendly despite the fact that I had on all three clothing items. \n\nWith $1.95 margaritas for UNLV students, I don't know why the heck all those kids were over at Chipotle. Since when did college students start valuing chains over cheap booze? Kids today--I just don't know, but I do know that El Patio was El Soliditito. Next time, I will have to dedicate a bit more time to actually looking at a menu. With such a drive-by experience, I feel as if I am only qualified to give a solid three stars.
