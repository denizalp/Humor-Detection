I just finished reading a bunch of reviews of this park. It's amusing the things people complain about. \"My dog got dirty\" \" there's a water fountain, but there should be more\" \"other dogs start fights\" \"parking is too far\". Unbelievable. I've been taking my dogs there for five years, and it is by far the best dog park in Las Vegas. Reality, it's a DOG PARK. There will be dog fights. If you're not happy about the location of the water fountain, maybe you should ask yourself how much it cost you. If you don't think your dog is going to get dirty, well you're just not too bright. If you think it's too far to walk from the parking lot, you are just plain lazy.
