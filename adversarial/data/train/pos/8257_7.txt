I'm surprised to see such mediocre reviews. The sandwich I had was among the best I've ever eaten. (Perhaps partially due to my ingredient selection ;) The accompanying salad was a welcome surprise. One of my office mates got a salad the size of his head and could barely finish it.\n\nHowever, now that I've heard of Sandwich Box, I'll have to check it out to compare!
