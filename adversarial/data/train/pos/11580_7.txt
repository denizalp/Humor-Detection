This is the food I want as my final meal when I'm sentenced to death or have hours to live on my deathbed... someone better bring me 300 EAST to ease my final moments! \n\nI literally dream about eating here. When my boyfriend and I have dinner at 300, he taunts me for sitting across from him with my mouth open, eyes glazed in the middle of a food-gasm.\n\nThe prices are way too expensive, but they're totally worth it... This just means I'm only capable of visiting every few months because of the $$$.\n\nThe service is good. Most of the time our servers are attentive and friendly, but recently we ending up waiting for over an hour for our entrees... something to do with the ticket printer?\n\nNow let's talk about the good stuff:\n\n-Baked Marinated Goat Cheese: Holy moly this appetizer is amazing! Rich goat cheese with whole cloves of garlic and sun-dried tomatoes.  This dish totally melts in your mouth. I recommend substituting the crusty bread for soft pita. Mmmmm.\n\n-Sweet Potato Ravioli: I DIE!! They only give you 4 pieces, but this stuff is so rich I'm not sure you could eat more than that. The Gorgonzola cream is what makes this dish, if the restaurant wasn't so classy I might pick up the plate and lick it clean. \n\n-Fall Salad: BEST SALAD IN MY LIFE! Hands down. Greens are super fresh, port-wine soaked cherries are the bomb, yummy pine nuts, and goat cheese a plenty.  I substitute the pancetta dressing for balsamic.\n\nPROS: heavenly food, fresh ingredients, diverse menu selection, vegetarian friendly\n\nCONS: too expensive, limited parking, limited seating
