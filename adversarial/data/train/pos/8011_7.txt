Oh thank the Lord and Baby Jesus for this store. When a fat kid like me forgets his toothbrush and deodorant before a business trip we are all in trouble...But Walgreens to the rescue! This is an actual Walgreen drug store, complete with pharmacy, makeup counter and such. They have everything you need without having to pick thru the 3 personal hygiene items they have at your hotel's \"Gift\" store.\nThis Walgreens in situated as part of the front of the Venetian hotel, just around from the fountain. Well worth the walk from most anywhere on the strip...And a little secret; They have a HUGE Vegas gift and novelty selection...Most every Las Vegas themed item you would want, at half the price of that pesky gift shop...Trust me!
