Venue is beautiful, Heart was fabulous.  But the venue sucks for concerts. I couldn't see anything because everyone was standing and I was too short to see over them. Needs more rise so everyone can see or a higher stage so people in the back can enjoy. If I want to watch a concert on a lousy screen, I will rent a DVD and play it on an old TV. \nThere is also a serious problem when a girl is so drunk and annoying that you can't enjoy the music and everyone that works there just stands by and allows her to drink more.  It is always annoying to listen to drunk singing, then realize that no one stops it.  They just stand there with their head up their backside  I just hope no one let her drive!  Many people left before it was over because it was not an enjoyable experience.\nOne of the questions is about smoking.  There is no smoking in the pavilion, but again, the employees stand there and do nothing.  The smell was obvious and the employee was less than 3 feet away.  He still did nothing when he was told the person was smoking.
