This place is horrible!!  With recently moving from another city, I made an appointment here to get a new primary care doctor.  Once I arrived for the appointment, the secretary told me the doctor decided he didn't want to have me as a patient after reviewing my chart and medicines.  I could not believe my ears.  I don't have any problems and don't take any medication out of the ordinary.  AND she decided to wait until I got there and tell me this with a room full of people.  I called back after I left, hoping for an apology and all I got was a \"yeah ok\" when I told them how they embarrassed me.  Never in my life have I heard of a practice not accepting someone for medical care.\nI wouldn't send my worst enemy here!
