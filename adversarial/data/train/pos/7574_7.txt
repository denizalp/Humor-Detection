We purchased a membership for our family of four. I am so thrilled that we did. We get little discounts on the carousel, giraffe encounter, early entry, etc.\n\nAside from seeing the animals, it is great exercise for you and the little ones. I love that you can bring your own beverages and snacks as there are so many places on the trail to stop and take a little break. \n\nA minor annoyance is having to whip out your membership card AND ID when taking advantage of their discounts once inside the gates. Maybe having membership cards with your photo on them (like Costco!) would be easier and faster.  Also some of the stroller caravan moms get aggressive, oh and the bathroom....let's not block all the sinks ladies. I don't enjoy having my ass smacked by every stall door on the way out because y'all don't understand bathroom line etiquette.
