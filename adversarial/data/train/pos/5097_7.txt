Fathers Day is coming up, so I call up some Apple Stores looking for an Ipad, and almost every representative I spoke to was not courteous. \n\nMe: So how many IPad's do you have left?\nApple Store Rep: A few.\nMe: OK awesome, can I reserve one?\nApple Store Rep: No.\nMe: .... so how many did you say you had?\nApple Store Rep: A FEW.\n\nYou know what? If you can't tell me how many you have left, just say so. No need for an attitude. \n\nWorst service ever.
