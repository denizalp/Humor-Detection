I agree with Dave R. about almost everything. Not a lot of selection, extremely oily and bland, and more expensive than what you could get at a lunch buffet. The reason there is always a line is because it's inside an office building, very convenient to people working there.\n\nI will not give it the extra star though, because even though it is presented as \"fast food\", there is no excuse for it to taste this bad. They really cut corners on the quality and quantity of the ingredients, and it shows.
