This is the worst hotel in Las Vegas.  The cost is over priced, the rooms are very old school and the staff is not accommodating.  My boy friend got injured from the stupid revolving door and he got a black eye and was bleeding.  They didn't even cover any medical costs and just provided ice packs.. Shouldnt they have at least comped our stay or given us a free nights stay for next time.  Even if they did provide me with a free night i probably would have not came back but at least I would not be on Yelp right now giving them this horrible review!  The T.V's in the mirrors are pointless.  There is really nothing to do at this hotel... NEVER going back.
