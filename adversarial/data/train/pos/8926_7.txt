I wanted to like this place. I really did. \n\nI went with a group of 13 and we were quickly seated on a busy night. \n\nMy friends had the deserts while I had a main since I was starving.\n\nI had the Pesto Salmon which was unimpressive. I barely tasted the pesto and the salmon left a lot to be desired. I was also disappointed as the menu indicated rice as a side and I got fries instead. I would have mentioned something to our waiter but hew was almost non-existent to our table so I just sat there and ate it despite it not being what I ordered.\n\nI also had their cafe mocha which wasn't something that was great. It was average at best.\n\nI will say that the decor and mood that is set in this place is great and its one of the few reasons as to why I really wanted to like this place.\n\nHere's the kicker though. It was mainly 2 things that ruined this place for me. The bathrooms were small and lacking the facilities to support the amount of people in the restaurant. The floor was slippery when I used the washroom and felt like there was a thin film of oil on the ground.\n\nBut the worst part of what happened that night was that my friends ordered a pitcher for mojitos and they found a live earwig in their pitcher. Naturally the staff replaced the pitcher and didn't charge us at all for it. But that should never happen....ever.\n\nTheir deals look great and I've heard their breakfasts are pretty good. I'm just not sold on it from my experience.
