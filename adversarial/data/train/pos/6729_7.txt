I had heard nothing but good things about this restaurant so finally on November 30th of last year I took my daughter there for a special birthday dinner.  That's how long I have been trying to connect with management at this restaurant.  The only thing worse than the service we got from our server Ronnie was the treatment I got today from Valerie.  Admittedly, she did call me back soon after the incident but I was out of town for a family death and her call went to voicemail.  Today, after my many calls Valerie finally called me back and she insisted that we had spoken previously since she was familiar with my situation.  Yes, she was probably familiar with it because I had spoken on numerous occasions with Jessica, who was always friendly and professional.  \nSo yes, once they re-did our over cooked steaks the food was excellent, the service? hmmmm not so much.  \nWould I be so brazen to think that maybe this manager Valerie is a family member?  How else could one be so bold to verbally assault  a customer fearing no repercussions.  To the owner: if she's not family you need to be aware that she is doing you a huge disservice \nThe one star is for the great food, but staff can take away from what should have been a joyous experience.  How does a business maintain a 5 star rating?  By remembering what it took to obtain those 5 stars and do not ignore the one star customer experience. People will always remember a good experience but a bad experience will be forever etched in their mind and their word.\n\nUpdate:  now I ask you given the \"owners\" response.  Who sounds crazy in this equation?  Who wants to eat at a restaurant whose owner responds in this fashion?  Is it any wonder his staff behaves as they do?  Look at his example.  If it wasn't so pathetic, it would be hysterically funny.
