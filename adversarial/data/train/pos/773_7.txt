This place is funky, and fun, and I have no idea why I hadn't been there until last week... \n\nI came here the other day for a birthday, and my god, am I glad that she chose this place!! Its got that indie boho feel, which I love, lots of hanging lights outside and the most powerful misters in the entire universe... So what if my hair turned to a frizzfro, i was sitting outside, for hours, and was not even hot. The waitstaff were awesome, and really really ridiculously good looking, super fun, almost to a point where I almost asked one of the waitresses to sit down and shoot the shit with us. Our party of about, 20 ordered a mix of things ranging from the cheese plate, to paninis, to bottles of wine to pastas, and everything I ate and drank, was super delicious. I myself didn't order any food, but I am super excited to come back and actually EAT here, hell, im excited to come back and drown myself in wine, all over again. \n\nThe only complaint I have is that there was a huge pool of water in the entrance, near, and in, the bathrooms.. I had on flip flops and wanted to projectile vomit when I stepped in whatever the hell was floating in that pool of gnarly. . I dunno what the deal was, leak? Spill? It was everywhere, and no one was cleaning it up.. other than that, I like you Bomberos.. What a pleasant surprise for a place located in Sunnyslope!!
