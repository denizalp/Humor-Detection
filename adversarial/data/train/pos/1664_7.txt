If I were to be particular, then I would say this is about a 3.75-star establishment, but in this instance, I suppose I will round up. :-)\n\nNo really, this is a great little place inside Market on MacLeod. They have a great variety of traditional pies (such as sheperds or pecan) but they also have a bunch of non-traditional varieties, such as taco pies. Not all of their pies are made the same and some of their rice dishes could use a bit more flavor, but all-in-all this palce is delicious for either a quick snack there or great meals to take home. Also, if you go on a busier day (like a Saturday) then they have many of the pies to sample. \n\nI notice that there are some reviews that are pretty negative and I think maybe it might be a case of inconsistency. The last time I was in the Market, I purchased about 12 pies, but I did so all at the same time. Therefore, maybe I was lucky enough to get a good batch. However, I love that you can get them in smaller sizes and there is such a variety. For instance, we got Moroccan stew, thai beef, taco, shepherd's pie, jamaican beef, and a ton others I can't remember. We have been really happy with every pie we've had and like I said, we were able to sample them before we left. \n\nThat day there was also a chili cook-off at the Market which was also delicious. Therefore, maybe if you don't like their pies, you might want to try their rice\/chili\/etc instead. In general, if you're skeptical, I recommend checking it out on a Saturday and see what they've got. The staff were also incredibly helpful and nice and they might be able to direct your choices to something more palatable for you.
