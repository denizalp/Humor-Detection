This Starbucks is pretty awesome! It's located right near my gym and is my go to place whenever I need a quick pick me up.\n\nThe biggest benefit that this Starbucks has compared to most others is that it is almost open 24\/7. I can't remember correctly if it's either Sunday and Monday, or Monday and Tuesday, but during one of those couple of days every week, during 1am-4am, they are closed to do a deep cleaning of the store. I appreciate that so that it doesn't turn into a complete sh*tshow!\n\nAnother great benefit is that this Starbucks is HUGE! It's not your typical small intimate coffee shop. This place is large... and in charge!! (like Charles - Scott Baio) ((not the Fonz, but still pretty good))\n\nGreat location, great hours, convenient, clean, the employees seem well trained. Can't really find any faults with this one. Way to go! (But I save the 5-stars for the local spots ;p)
