What can you say about a gas\/convience store..\n\nI like QT. Gas is generally better than competiive for the local area. This one in particular is in SC with lower gas tax so if you are in the area, you can save a bit.\n\nRestrooms are very well maintained and if you are looking for Coffee or a snack, this place is a good choice. Depending on how long they have been out there, the hot dog\/sausages can be very good or an experience you don't want to go there.
