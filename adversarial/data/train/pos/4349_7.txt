This place is a recipe for fiscal disaster. It's a cafeteria style buffet, where you are charged by weight (your foods', not your own). This is easily forgotten as you pick out nibbles and soon you are walking up the cashier, hefting your plate --as if that tells you anything-- and wondering, sweet God how much am I going to pay for this tofu?\n\nAs it turns out: quite a bit. With a Blanche de Chambly my total came to $18 bucks, and I didn't get THAT much food. But what I did get was quite tasty. There is too much to list, but I'll point out the Seitan Bourguignon, it's delicious. The selection is fantastic, but I can't see myself going back soon. It's just too expensive.\n\nObligatory Title Pun: VEG out at Commensal!\n\nMenu Readability: All the buffet items are clearly abelled, so you know what contains eggs, dairy, and what is 100% vegan.\n\nNeed to mention: So, they have two plate sizes here, but it didn't look like they had a clear way to tare the scale for plate size.  So.... get the smaller plate. (Correct me if I'm wrong.)\n\nWhat this place teaches me about myself: Commensal teaches me that I could probably live as a vegetarian, but it would require a supplemental income.
