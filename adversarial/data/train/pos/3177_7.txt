I ate too much sushi, as usual and needed to get some exercise, my friend somehow convinced me to go rollerblading. Ok, so we drove here to get me a pair since I left mine at home. \n\nThe store manager was super attentive and helped me find a pair that fit well, AND b\/c it was the demo pair, he gave me a 10% discount. SCORE!
