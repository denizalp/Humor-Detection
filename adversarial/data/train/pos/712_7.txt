I've been thinking of starting a Lunch Special list, and no better way than to start it with a sushi lunch special review :)\n\nHere goes, for $13.99 you get 4 items. 3 of 4 you get to choose & 1 being Miso soup. \n\nYou get to choose from and extensive well proportioned List of: \nUdon Soup\nRamen Egg noodle w\/Vegetables, fish cakes\nGyoza Soup\nFried fish bowl\nTempura Bowl\nSpicy Chicken Bowl\nSpicy Pork Bowl\nBeef Teriyaki Bowl\nChicken Teriyaki Bowl*\nSpicy tuna Bowl*\nSpicy Salmon Bowl*\nSpicy Crab Bowl\nUnagi Bowl\nCurry Rice Bowl\nMystery Bowl\nTuna Sashimi* \nSnapper Sashimi*\nAlbacore Sashimi*\nSalmon Sashimi*\nCalifornia Roll\nSpicy Tuna Roll*\nSpicy Crab Roll\nSpicy Salmon Roll*\nEgg rolls\nFried Scallops \nKroket\nEdamame*\nSpicy Tuna Salad\nSpicy Salmon Salad\nCucumber Salad\nSalmon skin Salad\nSeaweed Salad*\n\nI've Starred the items I've tried....\nThe rolls are very mediocre and don't even try the spicy tuna\/salmon bowls. Its basically a roll with more rice. The sashimi is very fresh but It's such a small dish to waste a whole order on since you only get to choose 3 items. The chicken Teriyaki bowl was very tasty, but its hard to go wrong with chicken teriyaki.\n\nDon't get me wrong its a GREAT DEAL, but you get what you pay for.  I still have hope for this place, so I'll continue to dine here for lunch when I crave sushi. Next time maybe I'll grab a noodle dish :)
