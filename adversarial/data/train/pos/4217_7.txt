When I began my search for the perfect home brewing kit I checked countless websites and message boards on what to get and how much money to spend on the ideal home brewing kit.  After a month or so of research I had a pretty good idea of what to get in order to make the perfect batch of sh*t face sauce.  When I got there I realized all my careful weeks of research and  planning had been in vein.  The dude that was there, who I think was the owner, was more than helpful on explaining every bit of the home brewing process along with some of the science behind it.  He informed me that a lot of the things being sold in some of the home brewing kit were unnecessary, which in the end saved me money.\n\nSo I've been successfully home brewing and even when I ran into a little stuck fermentation problem I walked into Vegas Home brew and quickly got an answer and some yeast activator on the house to fix my problem.  They have a great supply of grains and extracts as well as a full refrigerator of different yeasts.  I plan on going back any day now to start another batch of brew. I encourage every body to visit Vegas Homebrew and start brewing their own beer.  Not only is it fun, it will get ya drunk.
