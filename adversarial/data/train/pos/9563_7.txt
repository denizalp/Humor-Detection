Verrazano Pizza is a hole in the wall pizza joint that my family and I have been going to for many years. Depending on the time of day you stop in, unless it happens to be a Monday (they are closed only on Monday), you might have to wait for a seat unless you are getting your order to-go. I was telling my friend about this place and suggested it for lunch just over a month ago. When we walked in I noticed every table was taken. Luckily it didn't take long for a table to open up. I do wish they wiped up the tables more often during the busier times instead of us customers just taking over a table that is whatever way the previous person left it. When I stopped by for lunch last week, I was the only person there, so you just never know when they will be busy as this is a popular spot.\n\nI usually just have the cheese slice special unless I'm picking up a whole pizza to take home. The special is $5.29 and you get 2 slices of cheese and a drink. Each additional item is 50 cents. The sauce has a nice sweet flavor and the crust is thin yet has a slight crispness on the bottom and holds up cheese and toppings well. If you like to \"fold and eat\" then this pizza is perfect for that. I like how they aren't stingy with the cheese. Solid lunch spot indeed. \n\nThey also offer hot and cold sandwiches, chicken wings and fingers, pasta, calzones, salad and fried foods like mushrooms and ravioli. I have had some of their sandwiches and just found them to be okay. Here it's all about the pizza for me. They have a pick-up special for $11.99 that will get you a large 16\" cheese pizza during normal business hours.
