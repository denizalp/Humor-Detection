I left my contact info on their website today for a quote. I did receive a text message from someone named Eric Nyugen asking how he could help me. I told him I had an IPhone 5c with a broken screen that I needed repaired and was trying to find out how much they charged. I even included a photo of the phone and the damage to assist them in providing an accurate quote. That was at 12:42pm today; it is now 8:18pm and I have received no acknowledgment of my text, no further information... Nothing from this person... I would not recommend this company based on this negative correspondence and poor customer service.. I see no reason for the non response unless he was in a car accident or some other tragic event occurred (god forbid).. Regardless someone from the company should have continued to correspond with me as a business.
