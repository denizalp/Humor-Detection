some gouddda pizzzza, though expectations were high so ehh.\n\ningredients are fresh, kept simple. all about minimalism. \n\nclassic thin crust dough. twas good, but didn't blow me away. although I've never been one for thin pizzas (unless it is Ian's..they do their crust so right: crispy, yet doughy, so good). dough here was a bit on the gummy side?? if that's a thing. \n\nwe tried:\npizza bianca - olive oil, basil, garlic, fresh mozzarella\npizza rossoverde - basil, prosciutto, parmesan, arugula, mozzarella\ncustomized pizza of mozzarella, parmesan, fennel sausage\n\nalso ordered the caprese salad - tomatoes, basil, housemade fresh mozzarella, olive oil, sea salt\n^^delicious.\n\nnot sure which pizza was my favorite. all were pretty aight flavor wise. \ntheir pizzas are on the smaller size, so if you are starving, you should order six of them and you could probably polish them off just fine..*exaggeration*\n\nI'll be back to see if they can't impress me more next time.
