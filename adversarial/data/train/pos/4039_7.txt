Don't bother moving here it's a waste of time. Way to many issues. Over priced and painted way to many times. The kitchen cabinets squeak. The extra small bathroom is just that. Forget putting down ANY size rug. The tub is fit for a person who weighs no more than 200 lbs cause turning is a joke. \nDon't waste your hard earned money in this place. \n\nDenver mom
