The Orleans is a great place to stay if you drove to Vegas. For all you non-CA residents...the Strip is probably a better place to stay if you're going to be taking taxis everywhere. Although, if you insist, the Orleans does have some sort of shuttle to the Strip. \n\nNevertheless, good clean hotel rooms that were surprisingly spacious. Thin doors make for being awakened by noisy neighbors or jabbering maids (\"Hows-keepeeeng?\"). But if you're doing Vegas right....you'll probably sleep through all that nonsense anyway.  \n\nHotel boasts its very own movie theatre, 24 hour and 60-something lane bowling alley, multiple bars and restaurants including a 7.50 buffet! Dammit...that was a good deal! We ate all kinds of greasy comfort foods and didn't feel ripped off.
