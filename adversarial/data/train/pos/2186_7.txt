HAHAHAHAHAHAHA\nWhat an awesome time.\nI didn't even know I liked stand up comedy until I went here.\nThank you Kris and Yelp and everyone at the Port Credit Comedy Festival for such a fantastic time.\n\nI was KILLING MYSELF laughing.\nI think I was crying at some point.\nI was actually WARM because I was laughing so hard (this is big for me because I'm always cold).\nSuch hilarious acts.\nI'm so glad I was introduced to this through Yelp. I would definitely love to go again.\nStellar way to spend a week night!!! :D
