Another bookmark unchecked \n\nWith so many popular brunch spots in town, its hard to get to them all. This ones been on my list for awhile, first thought...this place is definitely different in a very good way. \n\nUpon entry your greeted by a nice 4 foot tall alien figure..yup! Say hello  then as you walk in you realize just how unique this place is. Let's start by the writing on the wall..literally, there is writing all over every wall. Want to add your mark? The sharpies are at the front desk...tag away. Now onto the decor, let's talk about complete randomness...snowboards, Elvis pics, more aliens, a curtain to the kitchen that's definitely from the 50's. Its awesome at how unique this place is. \n\nLet's move on to selecting your seat. Every table and chair is different! Yup! Talk about shopping for things that don't match at all. It's like they went to every garage sale they could find, bought one piece and creatively decided to use it as peice in the restaurant. I LOVED how the tables\/chairs were all mismatched. \n\nService, 5 stars! You definitely got the small family owned feeling with how attentive, friendly, down to earth the people were. It wasn't the robotic greeting, suggestive selling, touching the table and exit. \n\nAs for the food, I had the So Cal Low Cal and the alfalfa sprouts were a very nice touch.  They have a few celebrity chef created items so I'll be sure to try it next time.
