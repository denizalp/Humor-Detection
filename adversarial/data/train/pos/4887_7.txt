$1 beer.\n\nThis is a casino that belongs on Filmore with it's smoke filled slots and Subway in the back but hell, they have beer for a dollar. \n\nWhen I go in, I buy four beers and then put a dollar in a penny slot. After ten minutes and drinking two of my four beers the waitress would come around to take my order. Works out well. Before you know it, it's 5:30 and you have to head back to the hotel before your GF wakes up.\n \nI'd never stay here though.
