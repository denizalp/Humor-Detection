The person who designed this club could not have been thinking clearly. The ceilings in the VIP area are so low you don't even want to take advantage of the bottle service you ordered because you feel like you could die of claustrophobia at any moment. \n\nI did get enjoyment out of their policy that entails rolling drunk folks out of the club in wheelchairs - apparently drinking really can create a handicap.
