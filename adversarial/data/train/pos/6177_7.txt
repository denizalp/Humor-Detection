I wandered in here while waiting for my lunch next door...\n\nSome Sales Lady asked me, \"What can I help you find?\"\n\n\"Uh, I dunno, I just walked in here....\"\n\nShe turned to help other customers and never spoke another word to me ever again.\n\nNot my style, maybe this would be nice for a Mrs. Roper type of lady. In fact, I only saw older ladies shopping here with chunky jewelry, plastered face make-up, and apparel made of flowing fabrics.\n\nMaybe 20-30 years from now, I'll be part of the Chico's clientele...heaven forbid!
