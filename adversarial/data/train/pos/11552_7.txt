Thank you for ruining my Saturday afternoon.\n\nIt's been 15 hours since I ate here and I am just now starting to feel normal again.  I've been eating tums and chasing them with soda (to settle my stomach) as well as making several bathroom trips.  I have never been this sick from eating anywhere.  I think Taco Bell would have been far superior and they don't even serve real meat!\n    \nThe chips and salsa were okay.  My bf and I split the cheese crisp with beef (first mistake).  The beef looked grey  and the cheese looked old and overcooked. My entree was the chicken burrito,  I think they use chicken in a can b\/c the meat was so dry and shredded.  The waitress offered a sauce on top and good thing I accepted b\/c otherwise I would have had to choke down the dry burro.  \n\nGordon Ramsey needs to take over and revamp this place.  The location is prime but it seems like they were just being lazy all around.  I think they need to pare down the menu because there are too many choices and most of it is the same crap just re-worded.  Also, I kept seeing so many servers standing around shooting the shit.  If you don't have any tables you could be helping out in other ways.     This place really lacked warmth from the staff and I think it's important to make your customers feel welcome. \n\nI really don't see myself coming here ever again unless they make huge changes.
