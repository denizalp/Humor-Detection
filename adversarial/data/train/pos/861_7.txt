Unbelievably Tasty\n\nMy friends and I went to the Cornish Pasty Company for a bite to eat, and  all I can say is; the food was unbelievably tasty. Everyone cleaned their plates and wished there was  more.\n\nEach person in our party ordered a different flavor, and each bite  was better than the next.  Lets face it, what's not to like?  Take flavorful meat, cheese, unique vegetable combinations, wrap it up in a flakey pastry, then bake it until hot inside and crispy outside.  Serve it up with a side dipping sauce, it doesn't get much better. While your waiting  for your delicious entrée, take advantage of the great beer selection the Cornish Pasty Company has to offer.  Sip on a ice cold draft from a great selection while your delicious entrée is baking.\n  \nThe Cornish Pasty Company has a great atmosphere, very casual and comfortable.  Wish my phone wqs working because I would have taken pictures. I would  definitely go back to the Cornish Pasty Company again and again.
