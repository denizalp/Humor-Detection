Absolutly HORRIBLE!!!\n\ndo not go here!\nI went in to get my roots touched up before my best friends wedding (that I was in) and thought that since i had heard about how \"high end\" they were they would do an amazing job.\nSurprise surprise...They fryed my hair!\n\nthe roots were almost purple because they had to tone it 4 different times, then I had a big orange band from ear to ear from where the bleach didnt process enough.\n\nAfter the wedding, i went back to get it fixed and they were soooo RUDE about having to fix what they messed up.\n\nthey ended up having to Re-Bleach my hair and now my hair is breaking off despite them assuring me that it would be \"just fine\"\n\nif you love your hair like i do, NEVER GO HERE!\n\nthey are rude and have no clue what they are doing!
