Gosh, I can't believe I haven't written a review of this place. I've been here off on for my husbands annual hockey tournaments for the past 13 years. We used to come here with his teammates in San Jose many years ago so we have lots of history with this place. Good times and good memories for sure.\n\nThe hockey tournament they put on from a spectators stand point is done really well and seems very organized.  There aren't a ton of families in the stands because let's face it, men use this hockey weekend in Vegas as a boys weekend and the families are usually left at home. Fortunately for us hockey wives, it wasn't this case this year because with the exception of a few, we all came. \n\nThe rink itself is well maintained. The stands are pretty clean and comfy but wish they would put heaters up above to keep fans warm. Most rinks are doing this now. There is a snack bar in the center of the building joining the two rinks that serves the usual junk food but with the bar across the way, I think these snacks are tailored to the kids that come for the ice skating. \n\nOne of the games we had on Friday night we walked out from the ice rink and this placed was storming with lots of young, loud teenagers...so beware.
