My darling husband had the brilliant idea of going to get Mexican for breakfast on Saturday.\n\nHe had stopped here during the week one day while we were moving and was pretty impressed.  I couldn't wait to try it. \n\nWe arrived bright and early, since they open at 9:00am.  \nWe were greeted right away, and shown to our seats. \n\nOur server, Jesus, was fast, polite, and very friendly.  We liked him a lot.  \n\nThey bring out chips, salsa, and refried beans, which were all awesome.  The salsa had this amazing smokiness to it, with a good heat, and nice, thick (but not chunky, if that makes sense) consistency.  \n\nI ordered the chicken and beef enchilada, served with beans and rice.  \nThe enchilada was great.  Both meats were shredded, tender, and full of flavor.   Smothered in delicious cheese, too.  \nThe beans were good too.  The rice wasn't anything to write home about.  Kind of bland, and they put lima beans in it, which is really weird.  \n\nFella had a chili verde burrito and chile rellenos.  WOWZA.  Both of these were delicious.  The Chile relleno was a little too spicy for me, but he loved it. \n\nWe will most definitely be back, I need to try a margarita!!
