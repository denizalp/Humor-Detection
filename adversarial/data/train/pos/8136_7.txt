TERRIABLE PLACE TO GO!! I was walking through the store texting on my phone to my wife because we where looking for some stuff that they sell and the damn lady try's to yell at me across the store and make a big scene saying that I am taking pictures of their prices and tried to kick me out of the store!!!! TERRIABLE CUSTOMER SERVICE!! All they care about is money could give a damn about your pet!! I don't recommend them at all. Find another high quality pet store like Noble beast etc. hope this place fails!
