Alright, so I understand that while in the Dollar Tree, one must not expect to be mingling with residents from the Hamptons. I've accepted this, but my most recent visit to this location left me wondering if there's even a \"You must be wearing clothes!\" rule for entering here. \n\nAs usual, this place has tiny aisles and a mess of boxes of stuff being put on display along with items thrown everywhere by rude people who are too lazy to put something back where they found it (I worked retail, you jerks know who you are). Walking around this store a few days ago, I came up on an aisle that (no joke!) was about a foot wide. I can only hope it was temporary, but who knows. I also heard the familiar \"Dollar Tree sound\" of a child screaming for something their parent won't buy them. This time it involved a Sumo toddler female weilding two rolls of wrapping paper, named Marisa (I know this because instead of reprimanding the child, all the mother did was whine this name over and over). \n\nThis was the fattest child I have ever seen in person (Maury show doesn't count as \"in person\"). I try my hardest not to judge people, but this was awful. This poor little girl was barely two feet tall, MAYBE two years old, and about 70-80 pounds. She wasn't wearing shoes (though I'm not sure any would have fit her) and she was stomping on rolls of paper. Then, she was running down the aisle pulling stuff off the shelve and whining\/screaming because she wanted candy. I thought this was the worst of it. \n\nThen, I went to pay.\n\nThe woman, who I can only assume was the child's mother, was stuffing items all over the place she suddenly decided she didn't want (again, I worked retail, I know these people suck). She moved slightly while hiding a bottle of Mountain Dew behind a row of batteries and I saw the most disgusting thing I'd seen all day. She had another child, this one slightly less obese than the other, a girl with no shirt or shoes and covered from head to toe in what I can only hope was chocolate. I didn't know whether to report this woman to CPS or donate my .65 cents a day to these Save the Children escapees. \n\nNo one working there did anything to keep this woman's two older children (there was a boy who was about 5 pulling balloons down and punching them along with the older girl) from destroying the store. And good Lord no one had the nerve to at least double check that the brown goo covering the smallest victim was at least chocolate before she let the child touch everything in sight?! Customers were staring, but apparently being passive aggressive wasn't working because the woman didn't seem to notice. I'm not sure if the stares were merely out of shock from seeing a child who could barely walk & breathe due to her size. Poor thing.\n\nThe cherry on top of this \"experience\" was the meth addicts ahead of me directing check out line traffic; \"You.. you, you go over there and I'll--well, I'll stay right here, maaaan.\" They were overly excited to buy a giant bottle of orange soda and generally gave me the creeps the way one of them kept calling me, \"Babe.\" The woman ahead of them paid for their soda, so lucky me they weren't in front of me longer than they had to be. \n\nThe only saving grace about this place was the cashier. I've been helped by her a few other times and she's geniunely friendly. She seems to wear a look about her that says, \"If I could, I'd do something about (insert: aged druggies\/screaming babies\/children running & playing near glass objects), I totally would.\"
