Ok I've only been once but I already love this bar. Easy walk from the metro along a part of St Catherines that is seeing some new fun life with restaurants and bars and clubs all bumping at 5pm on a Friday. The bar is dark but not seedy, there's a low stage, big screen and second level mezzanine that looks down on the action below. The layout is great for visibility - lots of low tables around the stage, high tops in the back, plus the mezzanine. And the waiters are amazingly fast and efficient, they move through even a thick crowd smoothly delivering fresh drinks before you can blink. \n\nFridays they show RuPaul's Drag Race to a cheering passionate crowd and the vibe is delicious, can't wait to go back!
