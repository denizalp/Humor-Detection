I've tried this place for the first time many years ago and I remembered it being tasty, hardy and a great value. \nWell this past weekend I finally got around to going back and eating the food again and it was exactly how I remembered it. This joint is at an extremely convenient location and the whole places gives off a down-to-earth and friendly vibe. \n\nOn to the food:\nI had the home burger, the wrap (shared it with a friend) and the poutine. \nThe burger was very good and fresh. I love burgers that taste home-made! It was a huge burger and I couldn't even finish it on my own. The patty was definitely my favourite part, it tasted well balanced and reminded me of summer bbq's. \nThe pita wrap was very good for a place called village pizza, it was again large in size and the meat was cooked very well. \nNow the poutine was definitely my favourite! I loveeeee thick fries, and these ones were definitely cooked to the perfect texture! The gravy combined with the cheese curbs were well proportioned and it was very delicious.
