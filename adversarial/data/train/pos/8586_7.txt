Within a week of returning from Kuala Lampur, I found myself with a desperate craving for some KL Hokkien Mee and made my way here as quickly as possible. If you're looking for delicious, authentic Malaysian cuisine, this is the place. The menu is small, as is the space inside (with limited seating), and they're only open from Thurs-Sun, but this place is definitely worth a visit.\nThe Hokkien Mee is on par with the ones I tried in KL during my visit, and can even be made with chu yau cha on request! (BELIEVE ME, this is one request worth making!) The Wat Tan Hor is also delicious, noodles cooked perfectly in an egg sauce. Also love the chicken curry (creamy and flavourful) with the roti canai (perhaps not AS good as in Malaysia, but it's close; light with a little bit of a crunch) - no matter what you order, you can't really go wrong here.\n\nThe service here is incredibly slow, so be ready to wait for your food, and there really isn't much room to wait. If you're planning to eat in, seating is limited but there's also free (self-serve) tea\/water. \n\nThere is no better place for Malaysian cuisine in Toronto. Trust me.
