My daughter is dancing with them for more than 4 years now, since she was only 4; she loves this place and the instructors; she has tried few different dance styles and loved all of them; the facility is just newly built( they were in 2 separate locations before but combined both into this new location); front staff are friendly, welcoming and attentive to your needs; instructors are fun, energetic and very attentive to the needs and preferences of the parents\/kids;\nThey have great Year End Shows, and I have seen them through years how much effort they make in preparation for these shows.\nWell done Alive Dance Works.
