My hair was ruined. Immedietly i went back to get it fixed, the first day after she fixed it it looked great, as soon as i washed my hair the red started showing back through by dark brown hair it is horrible, i had to box die it back to a normal color. I was at the salon for over 4 hours for simple highlights and color. I went once before and the service was great, the girl that cut my hair the first time is gone and i had a new lady who did not know what she was doing. would not go back have lost my trust
