Lover Nails and Spa\n\nDon't you just love the name of it? Lover nails, I know I did. It was the last Sat of the year and in my normal totally unplanned style I wanted to get a pedicure.  I used my handy Yelp app, and found Lover Nail, and just by the name I was sold so off I went!\n\nI was greeted right away, asked what I wanted and told to pick out a color, but I already had my color, to match my NYE outfit, in hand and was directed into a chair.   My nail tech was Andy, and he was cool, great personality! Great foot massage too!!\n\nMy toes came out sexy like I wanted, enjoyed my time while there. Great service, prices are reasonable this might become my regular goto place!
