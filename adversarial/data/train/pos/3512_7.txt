I really wanted to enjoy this, I heard a lot about it this place. When I saw it arrived at kierland in Scottsdale that was my chance.\n\nStrike 1 \nSomeone at kierland decided that a 15th burger place in 2 square miles was worth removing the sprinklers that the kids played in during the summers. Bad move\n\nStrike 2\nWent ib on a Friday night longer move quickly, order was a burger, fried and a drink. 21 dollars please, wait what? Did I heard correctly.. 21 dollars please. Ok pay the bill\n\nStrike 3\nOpened up my togo order. And what I saw was an in and out burger ...except the fries where crinkle cut.\n\nSo exact same food as in and out for 3 times the price\n\nHuge disappointment
