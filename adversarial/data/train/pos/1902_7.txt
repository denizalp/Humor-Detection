Before I start my official review, I must address Yelp.  \nDear Yelp,\nI do not recognize the terms 'Happy holidays' or 'Holiday season'.  I live in Canada, and here it's Christmas, not some silly politically correct nonsense.  So don'ta maka me smacka you while using a non pc and very stereotypical Italian-esque speak. \/endrant\n\nLocated on the very busy Stephen Ave walk, Milestones is easy to find, situated right on a busy corner.  \nThe decor is decent inside, there are plenty of places to sit and it doesn't feel cramped.  I ordered myself a prime rib beef dip.  It wasn't too bad.  Tender and juicy.  Unfortunately, it wasn't nearly worth the $14 it cost as I didn't start crying from complete happiness after eating said sandwich.  The server was friendly, however she seemed to be over-burdened during the busy lunch rush and I didn't see anybody else serving tables in the lounge.  I maya trya this place againa, however, the food should be worth the cost next time.  I demand it! Bwahahaha
