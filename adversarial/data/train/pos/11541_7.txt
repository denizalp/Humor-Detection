Nothing but lies!  I've had Charter for over a year and for the most part didn't have any major issues.  The internet speed was inconsistent as anything, there were times when we had atrocious speeds and other times when we were over 60 mbps.  I've dealt with four different technicians and not a single one was able to figure out how to get the connection to work from anywhere but the damn closet.\n\nSeveral of the techs told me they couldn't do anything about it and I'd have to ask my landlord, but my landlord said that was BS and THEY are the ones that have to do it because they own the wires.  Never got this problem resolved and pretty much gave up on hoping that maybe one of the guys would know what the hell he was doing.  They were super friendly and I enjoyed talking with the techs, but I'd rather have competent people.\n\nDealing with Charter itself was always a nightmare.  We decided to try out Spectrum and have all three services, but after two weeks of having cable we came to realize that we don't really watch TV enough to justify paying so much.  So we cancelled that out and went back to internet only.  Charter was a dick about it and refused to give us the promotional price we had on the internet back -- they gave me some BS about only being able to do it every 3 months.\n\nSo we decided to jump ship to AT&T.  The cancellation process with Charter took longer than it should have because the douchebag representative I got was really tenacious about trying to keep us by telling lies about AT&T charging $15 a month in random fees alone and doing nothing but trashing their service.  I set him straight and told him that he should probably retake the course that teaches them what AT&T is doing.\n\nThe only way I'll go back to Charter is if they're my only option.
