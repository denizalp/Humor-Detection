I must qualify this review right away: \n\nWe stopped there in the afternoon, soon after they opened.  Maybe when it's busier the vibe is better and one has a better time.\n\nThat being said, our drinks were enjoyable, though they were expensive and a little weak. I think in the business they called that \"balanced.\" I'm not about a balanced drink, I'm about a drink that's going to be worth the $18 I'm paying.  The bartender was friendly and tried to accommodate some requests. The bar itself is beautiful and pretty tiny; I can see it getting packed very easily. \n\nMaybe we'll drop in and try it again? I'm not in a hurry back, but maybe later in the night it'll be more entertaining.
