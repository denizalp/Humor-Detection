I'd like a corn dog with a side of hearing loss please.\n\nI came to this Hot Dog On A Stick for the first time today.  It was about 11:40 AM and there was nobody inside.  The drive-thru seemed to be a little more busy.  There was only one lady working here today and she was focused on the drive-thru people.  Poor girl was working the drive-thru, the front counter and the fryer.  Things were backing up.  She had to apologize to everybody for the wait.  She acknowledged me a few times while I waited for her to bring the car line down a bit.  I give her credit for that.\n\nThe worst part of what seemed to be a very long wait was the alarm that was going off the entire time.  I know exactly where it was but I cannot say for sure what it was.  It was a device in the ceiling that reminded me of a dying battery in a smoke alarm at home.  But this beeping was not in any sort of sequence which made it all the more irritating.  It was so random.  I could not wait to get out of there.  With my food of course.\n\nI ordered two corn dogs, two fries and a lemonade (not all for me).  This came to over $12.  That is steep considering I can go to any Rebel Gas Station around town and get twow corn dogs for $1.  And I wasn't really even that thrilled with the dog.  The batter was too cakey for me.  The fries were good.  I like that they use seasoned salt rather than the standard table salt.  I wish they hadn't used so much of it though.  The lemonade was really good.  I like the hand churrned stuff.  That was probably the best part of lunch.
