So in THEORY, this is an amazing idea for a bar.\n\nAll your favorite games, from days, months, or years past, all in one place, with drinks, and fried food.\n\nJust like when you never left your room for hours and hours on end playing FFVII or Resident Evil as a kid.\n\nExcept it's more like those days when your older brother spent hours and hours on end playing Golden Eye and you just prayed he'd have to at least leave to use the bathroom long enough for you to swap in the Playstation and get one friggin' chocobo race in.\n\n(Oh! and there are STILL no girls in sight. that part's the same)
