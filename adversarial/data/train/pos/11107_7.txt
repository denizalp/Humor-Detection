Thai Country Kitchen has a great lunch special with lots of delicious and staple Thai dishes only for $9! I got the pad see ew with chicken (the only protein option is chicken) and it was delicious! It came with a fried vegetable spring roll and a sweet sauce. Only complaint was that I wished it was a little hotter. Other than that, delicious!
