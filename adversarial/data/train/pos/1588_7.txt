Great location in Caesar's Palace right in the middle of eateries like the Bacchanal Buffet, Payard Patisserie and Bistro, Beijing Noodle No. 9. Nice variety of liquor. Open bar area with seating and poker slots. Standing area around the bar. Of course there are a variety of cocktails that come with a pretty price.
