When you think hot dogs, what comes to mind? Those nasty things rolling around in a gas station? Burnt sticks served at every cookout you go to? Rubbery, tasteless non-descript meat? Well, let JJ's change how you think of hot dogs. \n\nThey use quality encased meats (hot dogs & sausages from Sahlen's in NY) and top them with well thought out combinations of ingredients, ranging from ordinary to extraordinary! You can get a plain jane hot dog, a Chicago dawg, or many other signature creations. Don't like what they have... fine... make your own! They also offer sausages, chicken options, and vegetarian options. \n\nService is great and they always have some sort of special going. I'm just waiting for them to add sweet potato fries or tots... \n\nDon't miss out on this spot!
