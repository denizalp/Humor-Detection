Plopped into The Host Friday night in serious need of Indian Food. My date and I got right down to business (food-wise). We started with the spinach chaat, with potatoes, chick peas and spices.  It was a bit sweet for a chaat, but still pretty decent. For dinner we shared Lamb Roganjosh, Mutar Paneer, Jasmine rice and a single garlic naan. As to be expected with The Host, the ingredients were all top quality.  You could taste the crunch of fresh peas in the mutar paneer, and the lamb was soft and tender.  The portions were pretty solid and our single naan easily fed both of us. But ultimately, there were no real standout flavours.  Everything was pretty mild and it all kind of blended together. I'll be back of course, but there are better Indian food options in the city for less money.  (Like at my mom's, for example.)\n\nObligatory Title Pun: HOST-a la vista, baby. (WTF?)\n\nMenu Readability: Elegant.\n\nNeed to mention: Even though the washrooms are in the basement, they are super classy.\n\nWhat this place teaches me about myself: It's sometimes hard to pay for Indian knowing my mom's cooking is only half-an-hour away.
