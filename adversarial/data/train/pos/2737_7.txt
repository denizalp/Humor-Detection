Placed an order for pickup, and either they filled it incorrectly or their sauces just don't have much flavor. The combo bowl (pork, beef, shrimp) is sufficiently fresh but I opted for spicy garlic sauce and it didn't taste spicy or garlicky, and seemed to be a regular light teri glaze instead. The shrimp and veggies were fresh, which is a plus. The $2 upcharge for brown rice is annoying, but slightly offset by their \"2 free egg rolls with bowl purchase\" offer online. I guess I expected it to be a bit better.
