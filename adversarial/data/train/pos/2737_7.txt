My most recent Dim Sum excursion to Dragon for Dim Sum has it landing at a solid 5-stars from me.\n\nThe restaurant is a little bit hard to find and even a little bit harder to get to. It's on the corner of 5th Ave and Centre - just as you're about to take 5th Abe over the flyover, there it is in the NE side, on the second floor, next to a National Car Rental. Not exactly where you'd expect to find some fine, authentic Chinese, right? Well that's just the beauty of it.\n\n1st time - Chinese New Years with Terrence L. and friends. A bunch of delicious different courses including lobster that I absolutely loved. What did I eat? Who knows?! I didn't ask and I didn't care. All off it was exceptionally tasty for the amount we paid. Can't remember the exact figure, but I can't remember paying that little for this extensive of a meal, ever.\n\nThe 2nd time I visited was for an Unofficial Yelp Event, arranged by none other than Ange T. Our group went to town on this Dim Sum, eating every steamed bun this and that we could get out hands on. Total pice - $29 per person including tax and tip. For an all-out, no holds barred Dim Sum extravaganza this struck me as pretty good.\n\nThey do dim sum via a sushi style check menu instead of a cart. You don't get to see what you order before hand but it comes out piping hot and extremely fresh tasting. I'll take the mystery with the freshness any day.\n\nNotable items - the rice of all things: plenty of seafood mixed in. A surprising amount.
