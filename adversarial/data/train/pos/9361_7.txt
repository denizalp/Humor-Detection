Whoever decided to put this mountain here sure did some quality research. It is in a great location to suit the community's hiking needs.\n\nI don't know how to rate the difficulty, but I saw a lot of fat people at the summit. I empathize with the fat community and I must say that this is a great hike for fatsos. I also remember one really obese man pouring out two gallons of water at the top. He was cursing the water's weight. And that was on a pretty hot day (go figure). Normally I would strangle someone throwing away water, but it was much more natural to just push him down the rocks at that altitude. I was too busy enjoying the sightseeing from the top to do anything criminal. It's a beautiful view and worth spending a 20 minute cool down once you finish the ascent.\n\nI was stung by a bee the first time I did the hike. I was pretty pissed off but I'm not allergic so naturally this hike gets 4 stars. There are few bees up there just in case you're allergic. Also, it was an unprovoked attack. I was just a victim of a bee gang initiation or similar.\n\nI did this hike when I was carrying a few extra pounds. On my belly and my back. Don't overpack. You won't need a multi-tool, Grizzly Adams. Just take plenty of water as it is Arizona heat. Don't do this hike between May and September unless it's very early morning or late night. I don't want you getting hurt!\n\nYou can take kids. Most grandmothers can do this hike. ROTC kids are known to run up and down this hike. As an overweight male I did this hike on 2 hours of sleep. You won't get hurt unless you do something stupid or walk carelessly. It's fun and I hope you enjoy it.\n\nOh, and final note, there's different trailheads for this hike. If it's your first time, do the less steep side. I hear it's easier but it will take you longer to get to the top. Head down the way you came. Do some research before you head out. This is just a review of my experience, and I'm not a hiking guide. Bon voyage.
