I think of myself as one who likes a good scare just slightly more than the next and I am highly fascinated with blood, guts and gore, however, Eli Roth you failed to scare me! \nThe sets were fashioned in typical Vegas style (which is better than some scary sets I've experienced, and the actors were enthusiastic enough, but I didn't jump one time- My heart didn't race, I wasn't afraid to enter the next room and I was bummed out by the DISCOUNTED rate of $25 bucks that I paid. \n\nI was more afraid walking through Downtown Vegas during the day than I was walking through the Goretorium. \n\nOh... and the bar you exit into was quiet - not happening at all. Took in the nice view for a second then was outta there.\n\nIf you're a horror fan, like to be scared, fascinated or intrigued by death, go on a ghost tour or something but don't spend your money here.
