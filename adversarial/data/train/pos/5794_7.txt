I was here earlier in the week and have mixed feelings.  I ordered a glazed old fashioned and a chocolate glazed and when I got home found two glazed old fashioned in my bag.  The first one was absolutely delicious and the second one was wet in the middle.  Not sure if it was undercooked or saturated with the glaze?\n\nAlso, I wanted a simple cup of drip coffee but they don't do this and offered me an americano or latte instead which I declined.
