Really interesting spot with a four room space featuring the works of many local artists.  Friendly staff and a truly rustic feel not nearly as scrubbed or sterile as other galleries in the area.  While I personally would have preferred actual prices on the works as opposed to a number requiring me to request more information from the staff this is a small quibble as the prices were actually rather reasonable for the quality of the worksmanship.
