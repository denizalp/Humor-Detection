My last experience was very underwhelming. The hygiene seemed to be an issue. We ordered two dishes and found hair in both of them. However, they apologized and replaced both of them. \n\nBoth the dishes were very spicy. So, my non-brown friends - this restaurant may not be for you. \n\nThe taste was good. The price point was good. The restaurant is located very closely to TechMahindra office, so it'll do well. They'll get a lot of customers during the lunch hours. But they need to get their act right if they want to get customers drive up to them from far away.
