This gas station has been around for a really long time. However, it has recently turned into a Circle K. I thought that it would let me change it to the correct name, but it did not. It's still finds it as Valero. I will check again when I stop by tomorrow.\n\nI was glad to see that the gas prices in this location within a shopping center in a pretty busy neighborhood worth $.10 less than other gas stations within the area. Waste gas prices being what they are, I thought that this would definitely be within the competitors prices. But on a Saturday afternoon it was definitely a nice surprise.  \n\nThere's plenty of lighting late at night. The convenient store is open late and the air pump it's free very close to the gas pump so you don't feel like you're so far away off by yourself. The convenient store of course has everything you need and a quick run to the store. And there's also plenty of parking even though it is actually a smaller station compared to others within a mini mall area. There are several businesses around that can accommodate everything else that you might need All in one stop.
