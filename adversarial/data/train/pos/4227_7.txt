This place was the most horrible pizza hut I have ever been to.\nFirst there was no one to greet anyone when I walked in, and there were already 2 people waiting, I asked if they have been helped and they said no.. Seriously someone could have walked out with the register and no one would have noticed...\nFinally after 10 mins..( seriously) a girl walked out and instead of asking who's next, she just helped whoever was standing I almost walked out...she went Togo help me and I spoke up for the other people saying you should ask who was here first... Horrible servIce, just horrible, my chicken wings looked like they were deep fried in acid.. My pizza cheese looked like brown spotted burnt cheese, service was the same as the pizza terrIble! Never ever going back there, you can't even pay me Togo back there!
