The Sunday morning hangover brunch crowd Nside Ncounter was almost exclusively sorostitutes and their frat bros wearing outfits that made me increasingly nauseated. ...We were off to a good start.\n\nI ordered the carbs bonanza, aka the granola pancakes, aka two very large, plain pancakes with granola sitting on top of them, served with fake maple syrup. I was hoping they meant the granola was Nside the pancake, but sometimes my menu Nferences stem from too high of expectations. It was not impressive, if you hadn't deduced that from my tone, but it was made of enough wheat to soak up Nything you may or may not have consumed the night before.\n\nWould I recommend Ncounter? Not N particular. But if you're N the area? It does the trick.
