If you go to a place called Nacho Daddy, you deserve what you get, don't you think? After all, who's your daddy anyway? Dining options were rather slim when we were strolling between the Fremont Street Experience and the Mob Museum. We noticed too late that Tony Gemignani opened one of his pizzerias, Pizza Rock, smack in the middle of the area, and we were already in shock over the sight of the Heart Attack Grill where they let people weighing at least 350 lbs eat for free. We were grateful we didn't meet that threshold.\n\nBy comparison, Nacho Daddy seemed like a downright demure dining destination in the middle of downtown Las Vegas. It's really just as much a bar as it is a place to eat although the menu is pretty robust with not only nachos but also breakfasts, burgers, wraps and other Mexican dishes. Jamie W. was hungrier than I was and ordered the $13.50 Vegan Burrito, which was a flour tortilla stuffed mostly with wild rice with bits of Cajun-spiced tofu, black beans, vegan cheese, diced peppers and onions, mushrooms, fire-roasted corn, avocado salsita and pico de gallo (photo: http:\/\/bit.ly\/1ZiHHn2).\n\nIt was quite a pile in there, but it wasn't overly flavorful for all the ingredients. I just went with the $9.95 Flour Quesadilla which was just a flour tortilla with mozzarella cheese melted inside accompanied by a mini-scoop of sour cream and pico de gallo (photo: http:\/\/bit.ly\/1RZtC8F). It was alright though something I could have made on a dorm hot plate a hundred years ago. We noticed the place start to fill up with regulars mostly around the bar, but I have to give props to the manager whom I think was the one serving us since the younger server was keeping busy entertaining the bar patrons. \n\nFOOD - 3 stars...middling Mexican food maybe more satisfying after a stint at the bar\nAMBIANCE - 3 stars...nothing special, kinda Tex-Mex in feel\nSERVICE - 4 stars...for the unexpectedly efficient server\nTOTAL - - 3 stars...now who's your nacho daddy now?
