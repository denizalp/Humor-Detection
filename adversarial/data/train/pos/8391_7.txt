Tried this a second time yesterday because I was carless and its walking distance to my office.  \n\nIt was better than the first time but still kind of disappointing.  I hate to say that because the guys that work there are all really nice and I'd like to see them do well.  I ordered a chicken bowl and the quality of the chicken definately seems better but its still not great.  There were a few pieces I wouldn't eat and the ones I did upset my stomach.  And as others have mentioned the bowl alone was over $7.\n\nI would rather go to Panda for the same amount of food, with a better quality, and a cheaper price.
