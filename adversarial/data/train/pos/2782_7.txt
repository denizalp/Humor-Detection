Very trendy spot downtown for apps and drinks!\n\nLocated right next to Vanguard, Therapy is in a prime spot downtown by all the fun bars and restaurants. Love the interior - it's extremely open with high ceilings. There's plenty of seating inside both on the ground level and upstairs.  \n\nThe menu is unique and enticing for foodies - I wouldn't recommend if you're a picky eater or looking for something plain and simple (burger and fries). I haven't explored their menu too much but have tried and really enjoyed their Filet Tartare. It was probably one of the best steak tartares I've had in a while! Very soft filet served in a miniature glass jar topped with cheese and egg yolk... absolutely delish! It also came with toasted bread and a few types of pickled veggies (pickled anything are my fav!)   \n\nI've only sat at the bar the few times I'ven been and have had excellent bartenders. All quick to refill waters and offer additional drinks.\n\nWould recommend Therapy for a nice date night or a night out with girlfriends!
