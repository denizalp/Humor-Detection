After a nice first visit about 3 weeks ago, I trek over from CenPho to Ken's in Arcadia to get a pedicure. I am looking forward to getting the knot out of my shoulder after a long first week of teaching.  \n\nIt was an a-ok pedicure. The results look nice. The ripoff at the end, however, ruined what was supposed to be a relaxing pampering session. Around 1:30-ish today when she walked me up front she mumbled a price. I handed her my ASU grad student ID (opting to use that instead of the yelp check in) and she didn't realize it was an ID and tried to swipe it. After getting that cleared up she said \"$24\"... hmm... ok. I had handed her $23 because that's about how much I remember it being last time with tip. I asked \"after the discount\"? She said $24 again. So I handed her $26 and picked up a brochure on my way out. \n\nSure enough, a regular spa pedicure is $22. I walk back inside and talk to the nice lady who greeted me when I initially walked in. I told her I just got ripped off. I was nice about it. Maybe my tech was confused about the discount... or something. But then she came back (of course my tech is now hiding in the back) and said the tech got confused and thought I was the other customer she had that got a callous treatment. Um...no. I did not get a callous treatment. I said I will take back everything over the $22 I handed her ($4). \n\nI got that back, but was reeling in the car. I swore I had a $5 in my wallet. Had I been that stupid (read: exhausted) to get doubly ripped off and get the old switcheroo? I don't know. But it doesn't feel right. \n\nI wish I would have taken back everything over the $20 that the pedi should have cost. Why I even gave her the $2 tip is beyond me. Apparently I should have asked if they could have written 'door mat' on my forehead. \n\nI will not be returning to Ken's. I will advise my friends to do the same.
