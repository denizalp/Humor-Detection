When I first ordered flowers from Thimbleberry the customer service was exactly what one would want. Joy earned my trust in complete customer satisfaction. Things have since changed.\n\nI have ordered from Thimbleberry 3 times since, once for an elderly patient where flowers were wrong, flowers for a friend who was ill ( we picked those up), then we used Thimbleberry for my daughters wedding.\nFlowers were wilting rather quickly it seemed, but  made it through the ceremony so I never said anything, and finally we get to today. *Sigh  Again I'm disappointed with Jan's could care less, and what I feel is an  \"Oh well\" type attitude.\n\n When I have been displeased with something and brought it to her attention like the flowers not being what I wanted, her response is the recipients should be satisfied. NEVER has she apologized for not getting it the way I wanted or just trying to make it right!! Flowers may be beautiful, however so are the ones at Albertsons in the same plaza.\n\nI ordered flowers yesterday for our neighbor who had a heart procedure . I explained to Jan that later in the day the delivery should be made, because the patient had to be discharged from the hospital and I had no idea how long that would take etc. Around noon flowers were delivered and a family member of my neighbor texted me asking ME to check on flowers left by their door. They had received a message that's where they were left!!\n\n $150 total cost PLUS $5.00 delivery is reflected in total and it's less than half mile from shop. This is the service I received...\n\nI called Jan and her response was \" I heard after noon, so that's what I had my delivery person do. \" Deliver after noon!\"  She said the delivery person said the flowers were safe by the door and they should be happy with the flowers. Still no apologies!! I said \" Ok Jan\" and hung up, because I will NEVER use this place again!! The arangements are very pretty, but customer communication\/ satisfaction should be key! \n\n I spend ALOT of $$$$ per year on flowers and I expect good to great customer service for my money!!! I will be taking my business to a flower shop that knows how to treat their customers!!\n\nWe work too hard for our money. I still believe in manners with excellent customer service for customer loyalty. That's my opinion.
