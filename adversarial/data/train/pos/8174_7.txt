My girlfriend booked the Escape for an oil change and I had the pleasure of taking it here for the first time. Upon arriving at 6:45 am there were already 5-6 people ahead of me waiting for them to open at 7am. Shortly before they opened someone came around to collect names and to ensure we all had appointments. Promptly at 7:00 the service area doors opened and everyone started to drive in. \n\nThe staff worked to take everyone's information and ask what they would like done. Those customers that weren't waiting for their vehicles hopped in the service shuttle and were taken away to an impending doom, or maybe just work. As I was just in for an oil change, I waited for the vehicle to get its business taken care of.\n\nWhen it was my turn for the tech to take my info I confirmed that I was indeed there for an oil change but that I would also like the tires rotated. He informed me that this was included in their \"Works\" package which was also the same price as just an oil change.\n\nOnce the tech had all my info I was sent inside to the service counter to tell the ladies there that I would be waiting for the vehicle and not taking the shuttle. They have a comfortable lounge with arm chairs, gourmet coffee machines, a TV, and newspapers. Of course you can also wander the showroom and let the feelings of inferiority sink in that your car isn't as shiny and new anymore.\n\nI had to wait just shy of an hour for the \"Works\" to be completed. While this isn't a quick 20 minute deal like Mr. Lube, and the dealership does their inspections, tire rotation, and oil change, an hour is a little long. Sure I wasn't first in line, but none of the people ahead of me stayed to wait for their vehicle so you'd think they'd give a little more of a priority to the people that would like their car back before lunch time.\n\nWhen it came time to pay the bill they called me up to the counter. They walked me through the bill showing what they did and what I was paying for. The total came to $117. I signed on the dotted line and drove home.\n\nI was later informed by my girlfriend that the Works package costs $60 and she \"politely\" asked why I had payed double that. Looking at the bill there didn't seem to be anything out of the ordinary other than the usual \"shop materials\" line for around $12. \n\nSo I hopped in the car and went back to see what the deal was. When I brought in the receipt, the lady behind the counter took a look and went off to talk to the tech that was responsible for my vehicle. When she came back she said there was no reason for the extra charge and they just mis-charged me. WHAT?! They accidentally charged me an extra $45?! How many other people do they \"accidentally\" charge extra for on an oil change or other service?\n\nWhile there were no questions or issues getting the refund, make sure you know what you're supposed to be paying before you sign on the line to take your vehicle back.
