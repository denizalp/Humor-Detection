I'm not the hugest fan of Jersey Mikes (My wife is though!), but whenever I eat one, it is never bad, and actually tastes pretty good for a chain type sub shop.  I was undecided on what to get for lunch today, but then I checked my Facebook page, and saw that today, March 30th, Jersey Mikes was donating all their proceeds to local charities (Phoenix Childrens Hospital)!  We had\/have so much love for Children's Hospitals (Radys in San Diego, mostly!), I knew that I would have to come down and get lunch.\n\nI went with a regular #13 (Italian Sub), chips (Doritos) and a drink (Wild Cherry Pepsi).  My total was just over $11.00.  The sandwich was tasty!  I had them hook it up with extra oil and vinegar.  The bread was soft, the meats were plentiful, and I loved the extra oil and vinegar.  It made the bread really soft and provided great flavor!  It definitely hit the spot!  Doritos are always good, and the drink was alright (Coke fan, here).  \n\nService was friendly and I enjoyed my lunch.  Super awesome that all of todays proceeds are going to a great cause, too!  I hope they do this every year!  As long as they do, I will definitely be back!
