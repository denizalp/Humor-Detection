5 Star theme restaurant if you don't count the actual food. Our nurse was amazing. The decor was great. The location was great. The parking was easy. The menu was clever. The hospital gowns are a special touch. The spanking is kinda scary, but a unique thing. But the food was pretty gross. I couldn't finish even half of my fries or shake because my tongue rebelled. The chili on my burger tasted a little like dirt, no a lot like dirt, which ruined the burger for me, too. \n\nNot positive or negative, just things you should know:\nThey do NOT give tap water upon request\nThey only accept cash\nIf you don't finish your burger they will spank you (not like your grandma, like a principal from the 1950's)
