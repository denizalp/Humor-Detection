We enjoyed a relatively late new year's eve dinner (10:00pm).  The top reasons I made reservations for Morels a couple of weeks before were:\n\n1. Proximity to the strip.  It's right by the Palazzo entrance.  Easy for us to run out and see the fireworks in 30 seconds.   \n\n2.  They were serving the a la carte menu unlike a lot of other restaurants that night doing some $250+ per person prix fixe bs.  I'd rather just do the full meal deal at Joel Robuchon instead paying that kind of money for overpriced NYE menus at Comme Ca, Koi or holy crap god forbid Sugar Factory.  \n\n3.  STEAK\n\nOur starters were the \"Onion Soup Gratinee\" and the \"Pan Seared French Rougie Foie Gras\".  The soup was a 3 out of 5.  We prefer our onion soups a little more robust and wine flavored where this was kind of sweet.  It was a hearty portion as it should be for $10 but not worth ordering again.  \n\nThe foie gras on the other hand was deeeeeelicious.  It was accompanied by caramelized red onion, candied apples and balsamic reduction.  There's just something about the fatty and unique flavor of the duck liver with fruit that I can't get enough of.  Restaurants in Vegas like Andre's and Gordon Ramsay Steak do it really well and this was right up there.  \n\nFor the entree, we chose not to mess around and just went with the 32 oz porterhouse for two prepared rare.  They served it tableside and it came with roasted rosemary potatoes, fricassee of baby turnips, sauce Bordelaise, onions & carrots.  We asked to keep the bone as always either in hopes of being ambitious a few days later and using it to make beef noodle soup at home or just gnawing at the bone while walking down the street like a couple of insane canines later in the evening.\n\nThe steak was very good.  32 oz is a monster cut and we were only able to finish half and box the rest.  I actually preferred the sirloin side over the filet this time around which was kind of surprising for me.\n\nAll in all a very solid choice for steak but still not close to the best steaks in their own building thanks to Mr. Batali and Mr. Puck.  I would come back here for happy hour and also when it's warmer to dine outdoors.
