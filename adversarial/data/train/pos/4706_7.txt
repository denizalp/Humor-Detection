Went here several times during stays at Sheraton Wild Horse Pass; it is also the source of poolside food and bar service. Casual patio dining complete with umbrella covered tables which are scattered around the center bar and overlooking pool; birds will join you at the table, it happens. \n\nTypical fare: burgers, sammies, chicken, salads, and bar bites=AOk; drinks were good and refreshing on hot days; servers were friendly and efficient. Perhaps I'm easily amused, but the 'flag system' (a flag at your poolside lounge chair which you raise for service) was ingenious to me, especially considering how many times I've languished at Las Vegas pools waiting for Holly, Bridget or Kendra to even TAKE an order! \n\nI digress, we enjoyed our food, beverages, and service at Hanyo and will absolutely be back for pool season again. 3.5*
