I frequent this joint all the time... But one thing I have to mention is that HOLY Shit! This place has the WORST service ever. Great food, but DO NOT and I really emphasized this, DO NOT expect any service. The servers aren't rude, they are polite but don't give a fuck.\n\nIt's a great place if you want some food asian comfort food. My friends and I always split a superbowl between the 3 of us with the fried bread. It's pretty filling and ends up costing around $6 per person with tip. Try the cantonese chow mein or the taiwanese stir fry. Those 2 my favourite dishes besides the congee.\n\nThe service is deplorable however. One time it took us 27 mins to be served after being seated. We got bored so we actually timed it. Luckily we all have phones so we were playing on them to pass the time. After all that time the manager actually came over and asked us if they've taken our order. We just laughed (What else can you do) and he gave us a discount. This place is the only asian place that does not want to take your money. It takes them forever to give you the bill, and even longer to bring back change.\n\nHey if you want some good congee, or decent chinese food this is the place to go. But be prepared to disappointed with the service.
