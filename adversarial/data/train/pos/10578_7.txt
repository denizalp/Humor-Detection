This is probably my favorite Indian restaurant I've been to, since moving to phoenix! I found out about them during the Asian Festival the other weekend, and am so glad I made the drive to their location \n\nI tried their lunch buffet, which had a 4 veggie-friendly options, a few different choices in meat (chicken, lamb, etc), and lots of desserts (the best part, yay!) Plus the buffet comes with complimentary garlic or regular naan, as well as chai tea.. \n\nI sampled pretty much everything, and could decide on my favorite dish, it was that good! The servers and owners were very welcoming, and quick to answer any questions. It was a great experience all around, and I'll definitely be back when I'm craving Indian food again!
