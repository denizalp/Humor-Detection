I went to see Mahira here to get my hair colored. Ombre to be exact. After washing my hair, she told me that if I wanted to get my hair dried then ill need to wait since her next appointment is here. So I waited. When I saw my hair, the left side of my hair was fine but the color on the right was uneven!! Her next client was waiting to get her hair washed so I told Mahira I would call her since I didnt want to complain in front of her customers and needed to get something to eat. When I got home the damage was much worse than I thought! There were missing pieces of hair that wasnt colored and the rest of my hair just had random blonde chunks. I called her right away and she told me to come back in an hour then calls me 30 mins later asking where I am since she needs to be somewhere.\n\nWhen I arrived, I showed her the mistakes and she tells me thats what ombre is suppose to look like. This was the last straw. I told her she can keep $40 for the hair supplies but I want a refund for the rest. She started arguing with me and saying that im trying to scam her. I mean come on! Look at my hair! SHE is the stylist and knew it wasnt suppose to look like that! She then told me that God is going to judge me and im going to get what I deserve. Well... she was right. I got my refund.
