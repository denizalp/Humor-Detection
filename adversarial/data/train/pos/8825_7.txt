I have to say the food is gross, but the concerts are fun, and the beer in the concert venue is cheaper than on the grounds, but either way- no beer for me. We went on the ferris wheel which only suceeded in scaring me. This fair gets 4 stars for the free on street parking, some guy who gave us free tickets to get in, and for inspiring my fiance to adopt a chicken. Yup. You heard it here first- we're officially urban poultry keepers.\nIts a hen actually. I'm from the midwest, were County fairs and the Quarter Horse Congress are more my speed. I will say a big thanks for the little 4-H ers who do a great job!
