I have been dying to try this place out and I love it!!! \n\nPoke bowls are wonderful because you can customize it to include everything you love. They give you options of using rice, greens or a mix of both for your base. The fish was all fresh and the selection of ingredients was pretty large considering. \n\nThe prices were reasonable and makes it affordable compared to other places that offer sushi concoctions. My only gripe about this place is not having a menu to follow with you as you go through the assembly line. I luckily found one that someone forgot but it makes it hard to remember all the things you could add. \n\nDefinitely go try this place, its refreshing, healthy, and delicious!!
