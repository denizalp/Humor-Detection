Vegas has this weird asian thing going on. It looks as if almost every thai restaurant offers Chinese style food. I am a food purist and find it somewhat crazy and bewildering that you can get pad see ew and sweet and sour chicken at the same place....end of rant.\n\nThe king and I delivers.....I like that when I am lazy. Is their food amazing no:...especially compared to Thai restaurants in San Francisco, Boston, Los Angeles, or Seattle.
