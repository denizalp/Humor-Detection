Slick's Garage Bar and Eats is a Fun New Restaurant that just opened in P83 across from the Peoria Sports Complex (where Satara Thai used to be). They serve mostly New Mexican Style Foods ( that means much of the foods offered include Red or Green Chiles) They offer Happy Hour Specials M-F 4-7, they serve bar grub, sandwiches, burgers too and more. The atmosphere is interesting it's like a fun Auto Collectors Style Man Cave. I saw a big Harley Davidson in the middle of the floor surrounded by lots of antique toy trucks. There are gas pumps, gas signs and lots of trucks and more. \n\nI tried a sandwich called a Service Car that translates to Turkey, Avocado, Green Chile, Provolone, Grilled on Sourdough Bread that includes a side. I have to say it was a DELICIOUS Sandwich! It was a tad shy with the turkey meat but those CHILE Peppers with the creamy avocado made this sandwich amazballing delicious to me. It was so tasty that I didn't lose a thing by leaving out the cheese. For my side I picked their house made potato salad and it was seasoned just right like it should be. They offered some other interesting sides like waldorf salad that I could have went with and a $2.00 extra option of Fries topped with chiles and cheese too.\n\nMy husband had the Carne Adovada Enchiladas. It more like a lasagna style New Mexican Plate. The Corn Tortillas are stacked like Lasagna. My husband got his plate Christmas Style with 1\/2 Red and 1\/2 Green Sauce. His plate contained a generous amount of nicely seasoned red chile pork, cheese and their delicious sauces with rice and beans.\n \nWe had a terrific lunch in a really fun atmosphere. I enjoyed looking at all the collectables. Service was warm and friendly.\n\nI'm so happy another nice eatery opened in this part of town. This is another unique (not a chain)  restaurant that's just what we needed in this part of town.\n\nGive them a try if your in the area if you like New Mexican Style Cuisine.
