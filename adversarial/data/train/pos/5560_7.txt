This place sure does have San Francisco prices down but lacks the San Francisco flavor. We ordered 2 BLTs BACON, LETTUCE & FRIGGIN TOMATO! And our bill was $45. I'm like ok this better be the best tasting BLT in the WORLD for $45. NOPE. Not close. The bacon was over cooked hard AF, the lettuce was, well the lettuce was lettuce. The tomato tasted like it was frozen then thawed out. (If that's a thing) but for $45 dollar BLT I expected my mouf to orgasm. Nope it was like getting a hug from a hooker. You pay for the good stuff but end up with blue balls.  \n\nI'm done.
