Living in Summerlin and having a revolving door of guests, I end up making my way around the local hotels and casinos.\n\nThe last time I was here we came to play some table games with some friends. Since all the card tables were full they were nice enough to open up a table up for us.  Our friend Don assured us that \"you can't lose\" in Pai Gow Poker. Well, I'm here to tell you we did!  But my friend Jesse won $200 so at least someone came out a winner!\n\nWe came back yesterday and since this casino is attached to the JW Marriott  we thought we'd stop in and try the hotel restaurant for lunch.  \n\nWe valet parked and the valet attendant had a frown on his face, no welcome, did not ask us if we needed directions and looked at us as though we parked in his front lawn. Some advice? Get a new job.  \n\nWe asked where the restaurant was and he named a few that were inside. \nBut really offered nothing helpful.  \n\nThankfully, when we left we did have a more pleasant valet attendant.\n\nWell, we went inside and never found the restaurant for the JW Marriott, if we parked in the wrong spot I would think the ding dong valet would tell us, but he was worthless.\n\nGot to see the casino in the daytime and oh my goodness, wow, like a nursing home in here, lots of walkers and canes everywhere!  \n\nIt's nice inside and they have a buffet and an Irish Pub, a nice date night restaurant and a lounge. Not sure I would coming running back though.\n\nUPDATE: I did hear back from a manager who apologized for my experience so I added a star which shows me Rampart cares about their customers:)
