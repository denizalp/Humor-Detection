So far my last 2 birthdays have been spent here. and both times were the best bdays ever. My fiancee has taken me to celebrate my birthday. We loved gambling and drinking there. Plus the room was gorgeous. It was the first time Id stayed in a Suite! We will be back next year as well! \nThe bed was extremely comfortable, and loved relaxing in the hot tub. Bathroom is plain but...come on...its just a bathroom...only time you will be in there is to get ready for another fun filled day and to puke your brains out from too much drinking lol\n\nlove it!!
