Driving up to Bonnie Springs Ranch, you see the beautiful backdrop of the Rainbow Mountain Wilderness. The land is prickly with mesquite trees and a variety of cacti. \n\nFor Halloween 2016, my in-laws wanted to take us and our toddlers to the petting zoo here. We didn't arrive until after noon which was a mistake not because it was crowded (it wasn't) but because the midday heat seemingly zapped the energy right out of some of the animals.\n\nThe nice girl at the entrance charged us only $7 per person - a Halloween treat?\n\nThe zoo was okay. Mostly clean. Not really set up for \"petting\" many animals except a mean rooster, a beat up peacock, and the annoying deer. You can reach through the fences and pet a handful of others. Bring quarters to buy some food if you don't mind pushy deer.\n\nThe staff is not engaging at all - at least if you have younger kids, I guess. They're too busy cleaning up and chatting with their friends who come in.\n\nWear comfortable shoes that you don't mind getting a little dust on - and leave the strollers and anything else with wheels in the car. The road coming in is paved, but the parking lot and most of the walking area at the ranch are not. Plus there are not many ramps. There is an outdoor sink well-stocked with soap and paper towels at the entrance\/exit.\n\nThe train is operable only on weekends. Fail!\n\nWe missed out on the melodrama. Bummer because I like live shows even if they are \"cheesy.\" Didn't stay for the Halloween festivities, but it might be fun once they kiddos are a bit older. There is a restaurant next door with decent food and a nice bar with dollar bills hanging from the ceiling. The staff, though, is not all that engaging or attentive there either.\n\nLots of tourists and motorcyclists flock here. (FYI - motorcycles have a separate parking area with a few concrete slabs.) Red Rock Canyon is only five miles away from the entrance. \n\nMaybe the experience will be better next time.\n\nReview #515\n'16 Challenge #81
