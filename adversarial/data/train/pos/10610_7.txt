This place is very similar to Carmel by the Sea in California. This particular part of Scottsdale is filled with tons of art galleries in a very small vicinity. Within a walk of the Valley Ho where some friends were staying we walked down through this area while on the way to the Farmer's Market and then looked at the different stores on the way back. We saw some beautiful art work from Russian and Japanese artists\/ themed to glass blown pieces. A good way to start your vacation.
