This place is super neat and clean and perfectly organized. They carry a decent variety of cosmetics, hair and care products ranging from Alba to Burt's Bees to grocery store brands, such as Revlon, NYX and other similar brands.\n\nThey also have a huge wall of travel size products by the register. The prices here are pretty similar to what you would find at Target, so if your looking for a deal or cheap, this store isn't for you.\n\nI walked through the store to get some nail polish and lip balm and most items were as marked and seemed a little pricy. So from the looks of it, it seems that Face Values don't do sales.\n\nThey do however have advertisements that say you can save a dollar if you have a coupon from their weekly mailer, which I haven't received yet.\n\nI'd say that from my first visit here, this place is great if you happen to be in a bind and need to buy something in an emergency. \n\nOther than that I'd probably stick to shopping somewhere else where items are better priced.
