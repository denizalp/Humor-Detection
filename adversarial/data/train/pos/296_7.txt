Cheap place to grab yourself an ice cream sandwich on Mill Ave!\n\nThe shop serves student friendly priced ice cream and ice cream sandwiches. The cookies themselves were soft, but basic in flavor and the ice cream filling is equivalent to a single scoop. I got the Snickerdoodle & White Chocolate Chip Cookies with Triple Caramel Ice Cream and enjoyed that the cookies were soft and chewy, not hard or crisp at all.\n\nService was a bit rushed as they were close to closing and there wasn't much cookies to choose from. The cookies weren't spectacular in terms of flavors, but great texture- the ice cream was good though, but for price point the quality and portion was reflective. A good place if you're passing through and you want something sweet and cheap. Unfortunately, not open late for college students experiencing drunchies!
