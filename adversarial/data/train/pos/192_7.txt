I stopped in to check out the 75% off sale. The place is very fragrant with all the scented soaps and lotions. The store is well organized and the sales people are knowledgeable and friendly. I was hoping to find something without coconut in it as my wife is very allergic to coconut. Most everything is made with coconut so I left empty handed. What can you say, 75% off you can't pass by without looking.
