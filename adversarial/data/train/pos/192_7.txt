The MGM Grand Conference Center has to be one of the best facilities I have attended for conferences. There is ample parking for attendees in the garage and the conference center is on the 3rd floor that's right across the garage. There is active construction going on outside the conference building. I can't wait to see the results!Â The only downside to this is that MGM Resorts International just implemented a parking fee of $12 to self-park in the garage and $20 for valet. Thank goodness the Children's Heart Conference is always FREE to attend!\n\nThe conference space assigned has the capacity to house the 1200 attendees this year. The room is well lit, has good seats, comfortable temperature, and the free wifi speed was above average for a conference room. The restroom is not too far from the conference room and if the rush hour creates a long line, you can go one level down the escalator where additional restrooms can be found. The staff always maintains the restrooms in pristine condition.\n\nThe entire staff that works the conference center is remarkable! I can't emphasize enough how well they place and maintain food from hot and cold beverages to breakfast and lunch meals. The staff is well organized and very professional. This is my 3rd conference and every year they still manage to amaze me! I'm looking forward for 22nd Heart Conference next year where you can be well informed from some of the renowned pediatric physicians as guest speakers! Priceless!
