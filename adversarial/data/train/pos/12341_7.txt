I love these bagels, they are soo delicious and are amazing when they come right of of the oven. I tried them here because I usually go to Sunrise on Sheppard  and I wanted to see if they taste different comes from the actual store rather being frozen. When they are ready to use them they just pop them in the oven. My opinion they tasted the same, doesn't matter where you go to get Gryfe's bagels, are seem to have the same get deliciousness!
