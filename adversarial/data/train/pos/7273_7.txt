In summary: simply outstanding night at the Bremner! \n\nThe night actually started with a hiccup as we had to wait 20 mins past our reservation time to be seated and then some more for our waiter to come tend to us. However, once he did and greeted us with a 'welcome to the bremner' the night sailed oh-so smoothly from there on. \n\nThe wine list: great wine list for every price point (40-1000$ bottles) as well as a short but very well diversified wine by the glass options.\n\nWe ordered based on many Yelp reviews and started off with fresh scallops from les Ã®les de la Madeleine. This was the first time we had scallops still in their shell; really fresh, super well cleaned and surprisingly very meatly in consistency.   \n\nThen came the appetizers which consisted of fried quail and lamb heart in celeriac remoulade. \nThe fried quail was delicious! The batter was perfectly seasoned with some heat and so crunchy! Think the best fried chicken you've ever had but better since it's quail which is a more tender meat. \nThe lamb neck was surprisingly good. My partner's favorite dish of the night. Didn't taste gamy at all and sliced so thinly that you don't get the usual pasty taste of heart. It paired perfectly with the mustard seed dressed celeriac remoulade it came with.\n\nFor mains, we opted for the lamb neck cavatelli and the whole sea bream. Again, both outstanding dishes but the sea bream was the bigger star out of the two. Just a delight to filet yourself and work a bit for each bite of perfectly seasoned and cooked fish. \n\nAfter all this, we were so stuffed that we had no room for dessert. \n\nWe have to make a special mention to our waiter, Nate who provided us with such an amazing service that we had forgotten all about out initial wait delay. \n\nYes it was expensive (100$ pp without tip), but this was a good example of 'you get what you pay for.' From its eclectic decor to its outstanding service and food (even the music was an awesome mix of 90's rock which then turned into 90's R&B later in the night) this was one of the best dining experiences I've had in a while!
