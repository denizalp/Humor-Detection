This is my second time coming here, located inside Luxor Hotel.\n\nOne of the restaurants who closes later as they have a full menu and bar. \n\n-Customer Service-\n\nVery welcoming host and waiter. Our waiter was very attentive to our table and was professional yet friendly.\n\n-Drinks and Food-\n\nOrdered a Strawberry Mule, suppppper tasty as this is my first time having a Mule. It's very similar to a mint mojito. \n\nAlso ordered a Cesar salad which came out as a big order. To go is a must but wish they had slices of cheddar, other than that great experience
