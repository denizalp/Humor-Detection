This is a entertaining burlesque show that has Holly Madison as a side interruption. Holly Madison truly has no talent...she cannot act, she cannot sing, and she even has a gut compared to the rest of the dancers. \n\nMy favorite dancer is the girl in green, she is by far the best pole dancer and can accurately perform all the numbers with ease. The second is the \"Teddy\" bear dancer, well, she can dance and sing really well! \n\nthe show is for a fun, light hearted evening and not for the people who are looking for deep plot or great acting. Is just for fun not a show that will leave you thinking about the ending! cough up the $100 and have a good time...don't expect more than that. Your in Vegas, baby!\n\ngood for kids? OH Yea!! bring your kids and get them started on the birds and the bees a little earlier in life to reduce future confusions.
