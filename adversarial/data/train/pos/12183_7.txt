We phoned our Pizza and wing order in at 3:30 for a 5:30 pickup\nAt 5:40 we were told \"5 more minutes\". This was repeated 6 times \n  at 6 pm we told staff we had enough and we're leaving\nA cold pizza was found somewhere and wings were half cooked and given to us\nWe were too tired and hungry to drive back with the news that it was not even close to what we ordered\nWe try to give local independent places our business but this neighborhood pizza place should be closed
