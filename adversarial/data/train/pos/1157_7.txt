What better way to enjoy your lazy day off than kicking back with a bunch of your favorite movies and chowing down on Chinese take-out? I decided to go to Red Shrimp Co. so I didn't have to suffer through the horrible Chinatown traffic. Their food is average at best, but nothing too spectacular.\n\nI ordered the Mongolian beef and scallop fried rice. \n\nThe Mongolian beef's sweet chili sauce was pretty good. Not overbearing and goes great as a drizzle over the steamed white rice they give you with the order. Unfortunately, there were WAY too many leeks and white onions than there was actual beef. It was also soaked in an unappealing orange-tinted oil. \n\nNot many Chinese take-out places offer scallop fried rice as an option, so I went with it. The scallop fried rice was a bit bland for my liking. They were super sparing on the scallops as well (I saw a few scallop bits in there, but it wasn't that many). \n\nHere at the Red Shrimp Company, they give you a lot of food for an okay price for what it's worth... I think this place definitely has the \"quantity over quality\" ideology here. I'm a little bit disappointed that their dishes were like 80% \"filler\" ingredients, but I can't expect too much from a run-of-the-mill Chinese take-out place...\n\nHey, at least they saved me from making a trip into the heart of Chinatown for take-out!
