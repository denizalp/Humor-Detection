Checker cab with license plate K 57339 - the driver last night is nothing short of a disgusting pig and I did report this to the police cruiser parked a block away.  I was parking my car before dinner and I see a man peeing in the parking lot.  I assumed he was homeless and thought nothing more - that is until I see he is peeing all over a newer Jeeps front bumper.  \n\nBefore I had a chance to get out and say something he runs across the street and jumps into his car.  He was the driver and was waiting in line to hopefully get a fare from the hotel.  Instead of using the public washroom inside the hotel which was even closer he thought the front of this jeep would save him time and still allow him to stay in the line up of cabs.\n\nSome lucky customer handed him a credit card to pay not knowing that this guy just pissed in a parking lot over someone elses car and didn't wash his hands.  \n\nI know first hand that 1 bad apple can ruin it for the bunch in a customer service industry.  This review is not knocking the company or other cab drivers whom I have had a pleasant experience with however the 1 * rating is directed towards the despicable actions of the 1 driver therefor it also attaches to the company whom employs him.
