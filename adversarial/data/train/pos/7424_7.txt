If you are wanting to read a review regarding any type of wedding plans for Rhodes Ranch please refer to my review on the Rhodes Ranch Club House Restaurant. \n\nThis review is for the beautiful Rhodes Ranch community~ My boyfriend lives here so I am pretty much here all the time. There is really not much to complain about. \n\n-24 hour guarded security: The security actually writes down all visitor's info and calls the resident to get approval! Super safe neighborhood! This is great for those who have crazy ex girlfriends! And all of the security peeps are super nice. \n-Beautiful community: Very well kept, clean and the golf course looks great in the sunset and sunrise! Great place to jog~\n-Amenities: club house, gym, pool, mini water park, basketball courts, volleyball courts, billiards room..and so much more!\n-Nice people: the people are really nice here haha everyone waves at everyone!\n-Get togethers: We have thrown plenty of little get togethers and gatherings with our friends and have had no complaints. Just remember to let the gate know.\n-Weather: My boyfriend is convinced it's cooler here and the air is not as dry due to the golf course HAHA \n\nMy only complaint would be parking. They are very strict about street parking through the night. They put an annoying violation sticker on your car that is a biatchhhhhhhh to get off. Easy fix though, just ask the gate for an overnight pass.. They are valid for 3 nights~ \n\nVerdict: great place to live for everyone~!!!
