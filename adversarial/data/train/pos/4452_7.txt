Tokyo Cafe is a win!\n\nI'm not usually on this side of town, but I was out here visiting a friend and wanted to pick up food on my way home. With the help of the Yelp app, I found Tokyo Cafe.\n\nLocated in a small shopping center, Tokyo Cafe can be difficult to find at first. Once you park, you might try to rethink your decision if this was a good find or not. This place looks nondescript for a place called \"Tokyo Cafe\". Decor is not fancy by any means, but sometimes those are the most delicious places and in this case, it is true!\n\nThe menu is simple and straight forward. I ordered the steamed gyoza, the tonkotsu ramen, and the chicken katsu curry. The person who took my order was quick and friendly. I only waited about 10 minutes for my order. While I was waiting at one of the tables, I saw someone eating their order of fried rice. My mouth started to water so I jumped back in line and ordered a chicken fried rice to go. Don't judge me.\n\nThe gyoza was good. They come either steamed or fried to your liking. The ramen was really good despite some of the questionable pictures that I found on yelp. The broth was delicious and the toppings were generous. The chicken katsu curry was huge! The katsu was crunchy and the serving of rice was heavy. The curry came on the side, which I appreciated since my food was to go. The fried rice was flavorful and also a very generous serving. \n\nThe food alone was tasty which would be a solid four stars from me. The extra start comes from the price. All of this food for under $30 was a steal. Even the two of us couldn't even make a dent with these crazy portions. Talk about leftovers for lunch tomorrow. I can dig that.
