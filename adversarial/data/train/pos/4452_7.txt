The service was quick and Mike the plumber, did a good job. He repaired and  improved my outside plumbing for the irrigation \/ hose.  Unfortunatly, I purchased the deal promoted above, pay $100.00 for 200.00 worth of services at Alaskan Home Services. When presented with the bill, I gave the voucher.  Mike called his office but they did not honor the coupon.  They said it was for HVAC only.  But the voucher does not state that.  I have asked for a refund on the coupon.
