I stopped into Pita Jungle on a Sunday afternoon to grab a gyro to go for my drive back to San Diego.  The gyro isn't what I would call \"authentic\"...the flavor seemed off a bit, but I did like that they grilled the pita bread so it was a little crispy.  \n\nThe inside of Pita Jungle is very unique...very hip and very un-Greek.  Most everyone working was white including the amazingly cute blonde hostess at the front.  Wow.  Five stars...but deduct one for the lack of fries.  I tried the garlic potatoes and though they were okay I'd rather have fries or wedges.\n\nI'd come back for sure for the well, scenery, and maybe even some food.
