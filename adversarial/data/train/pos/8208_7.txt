If you are drunk and anywhere near the Cosmo, this is the spot. Their pizza is amazing! I love how thin and crispy it is. This last time I came the guy didn't toast my pizza so I made him make it crispy and it was perfect. It's really over price for a slice so if possible get the whole pizza and share it. But then again it's Vegas and Cosmo so what do we expect.
