Found out about Grouchy John's through their food truck at a local event. I decided to stop by their brick and mortar and it is pretty big. The atmosphere had a comic book, movie, board game type of vibe like the names of their drinks. I really love the honey latte with soy milk! Don't forget to get a stamp card and check in! You get the double the stamps when you check in! =D
