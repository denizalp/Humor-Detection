I've been here twice now and both times the food has been mediocre. Last time\nI had the red curry with chicken and my friend had the pad Thai with chicken. Both dishes were a bit boring- needed something else.... more spice? Peanuts? Cilantro? ... something. The time before I had the papaya salad, and again it felt like it was missing something. \nOn the positive- the prices are reasonable and the staff are very pleasant. They've done a great job with the interior, and I think it's a great addition to 4st dining.
