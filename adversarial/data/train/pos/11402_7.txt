If you haven't recently been to Fremont street in Downtown Vegas then you don't know what you've been missing. There are so many freshly remodeled hotels, and new bars etc .\n\nThis place for instance, I actually don't even remember what hotel this used to be. All I know is that I'm diggin it now. The exterior entrance looks great,........ Humongous red neon \"D\", ....very eye catching. Then you walk in and you forget that you're actually on Fremont anymore. It's totally nice inside,.....very modern. The layout is great and it's definitely got that \"cool\" factor going for it.\n\nI haven't actually stayed in this hotel as of yet, but I'm definitely planning on it for the next time I visit..........Then I will have to update and add that to my review.
