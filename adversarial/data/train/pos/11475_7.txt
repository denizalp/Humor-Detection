Just take my money!!!!!!!! \n\nTarget is my happy place! I love how they have promotions, especially on baby items. I love their Cartwheel app that saves me even more money. I love the Target debit card that saves me 5% on every purchase. \n\nAlthough there is another Target closer to my home, I'd much rather come to this location. First off, they have a Starbucks inside to help me fuel up for my shopping trips. The employees are much nicer here. If I have a return to do at customer service, the employees aren't rude about it. The layout of this store is much more organized and the items I need are always in stock. I've never had to wait long at the register since they always have more than 2 open. \n\nThank you for being my peaceful getaway from crazy mom life. But dang you for taking all my money.
