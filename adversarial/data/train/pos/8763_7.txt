This restaurant does not have the capacity to serve a large party (20+ people) in an adequate time frame, has abysmal service, and mediocre food. \n\nMy friend hosted her birthday here and it was for a large party of around 20 people. The restaurant was not busy for a Saturday night and there were maybe 3-4 other tables. Everyone arrived by 8:15 and we ordered by 8:30........only for our food to arrive around 10:30. What really gets on my nerves is the servers, they gave us ZERO reassurance about our food. They just came, filled our glasses with water and left. Nothing about getting some more appetizers, or apologizing for the delay, or suggesting that maybe some people can get there food first? When asked, they simply said \"soon\"...which meant waiting for another 1.5 hours. I think the strategy for the restaurant is to starve their patrons so the food would seem to taste better.\n\nAs for the food, the pizza wasn't bad, but not good either. Thin crust, little sauce, little cheese, non-existent toppings. The taste was good, but for the value...not worth it. Some of my friends ordered the pasta and I have to say that it was the worst pasta I have ever eaten. The carbonara linguine was overcooked and every bite left this powdery residue in the mouth. It also had this terrible after taste to it...simply unpleasant.\n\nI really wanted to like this restaurant especially because of the unique look. I have also never heard an accordion been played so well, although it was disruptive at times. At the end of the night, the 18% mandatory gratuity was not deserved. Will not be coming back
