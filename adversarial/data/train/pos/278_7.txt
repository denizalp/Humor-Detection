This has to be one of the \"better\" Home Depot's to shop at in the Phoenix market.  This big orange home supply store has almost everything you need for those weekend \"honey due\" projects. \n\nIt's in a great location that's easy to find.  The inside is very clean and well organized as far as Home Depot's go.  This location is not as busy as the other Home Depot's due to it's location yet they offer all the same product selections and seem to be always be in stock with the things other Home Depot's may run out of.  \n\nTheir paint, wood, plumbing, appliances and out door areas are top notch and staffed with knowledgeable experts.  Can't say the same about their lighting, electrical and power tools which is keeping them from getting 5 stars.\n\nThe next time you need supplies for your home repairs, this is the place to shop!
