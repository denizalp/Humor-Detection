I hate doing the 1 star thing.  But there was nothing about my experience that would make we want to give this place another shot.\n\nIt was rainy out, I was feeling lazy, and just wanted some delivery.  I called and was instantly kind of put on hold.  Not totally on hold as I could hear everything going on in the restaurant.  When she came back to the phone she asked me what I wanted(in very broken English).  I gave my order and mentioned a coupon, but couldn't get a total out of her.  I should have just gone with cash at that point, but still gave my credit card.  She then decides to tell me it will be over an hour after she runs my card.  I had some snacks around the house, so I figured I would just deal with it.\n\nA little over an hour later my food showed up.  I tipped 20%+ as it was raining pretty hard.  Then I look at the receipt.  Not only was my coupon not honored, but they put on a $3 delivery fee without telling me.  I asked the delivery driver about the coupon and he said there was nothing he could do and agreed that the person answering the phones didn't speak English very well.  He could have at least pretended to make a phone call though.\n\nThen onto the food.  Hibachi Steak, chicken, and shrimp with white rice.  Well, they gave me fried rice instead after I was specific.  Then the meat...... EWWWW.  The shrimp smelled really fishy and had some weird slimy coating on it.  The chicken had quite a strange texture.  The beef was at least edible, but barely, and the texture there was off too.  My dog wouldn't even eat it.  I ended up just making fried rice with the veggies and the rice and threw everything else out.\n\nWith sooooo many Asian spots in the area, I doubt I'll ever give this spot another try.
