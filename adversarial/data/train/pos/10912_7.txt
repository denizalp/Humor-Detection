First off, I'm glad my mom dragged me around bargain shopping with her when I was little. Start em off young, they say. I love bargain shopping now, and Last Chance? No sweat. This is what I do when I need to de-stress.\n\nI haven't had the chance to really fight for a deal yet. Meanwhile, I'll watch the worst in women come out in this survival-of-the-fittest environment. I have war stories to tell for each time I've gone in. Friendships broken. Alliances and enemies made. Children abandoned.\n\nI have found some pretty amazing deals here, this is the bargain store I can go where all the clothes\/shoes on the medium\/7\/8 racks aren't taken. I always leave having bought at least 1 thing. Designer brands for pretty much nothing, compared to their original price. Just beware of damage- that's why most of the stuff at LC's there in the first place.\n\nWord of warning for bikini shoppers (or two-piece anything)- you'll go through hell and back more than once to find the right size and match. I have bikinis without their other half because I couldn't pass up the chance and hope to god I'll find the other half someday- even something that remotely matches or from another store. I walk around with them in my purse just in case I come across something that looks like it matches so I can try it on together. I have a BCBG bikini bottom that I bought one year, and finally found the matching top the next year.\n\nJust to reiterate what everyone else has been saying: If you don't like to get down and dirty to find a deal, steer clear, because you'll get eaten alive in here. Stick to the Marshall's just outside.
