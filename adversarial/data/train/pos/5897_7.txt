Do it. Do the dumplings. Now, not later.\n\nLook, I'm not qualified to judge the 'authenticity' - I get that these are soup dumplings. And apparently that is something that needs a panel of critics to assess. All I know is that there were amazing meats and seasonings encased in dumpling material. Delish.\n\nIf you're not intrepid enough to chance liquid spewing all over you, I would recommend ordering the fried dumplings - they are less likely to end up on your clothes, and they are also probably closer to what you think of when you think \"dumpling\".\n\nWe got three orders of dumplings, for three people, and it was so much food, finishing up the last few became a test of courage, a challenge of endurance. What I'm saying is that these are delicious and filling.\n\nCan't wait to go back for a very wallet-friendly lunch!\n\nTaking a point off because the restrooms were kind of a mess, and that's one of my huge pet peeves; plus the service was, well, lack-luster: \"Hello? Helloooooooo...\" But all in all, a great time was had by all.
