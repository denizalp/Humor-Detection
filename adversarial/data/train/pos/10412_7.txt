Weekend before last, I went in and saw a sign that said they had stopped selling for the night, so later that week, I called to see what the cut-off time was for bringing in clothes. I was informed it was 6PM and because I practice yoga in the evenings, it's difficult for me to make it there before that time. So I waited until the following Saturday, only to be informed that they aren't buying again until Monday. At this point, I was starting to get irritated, as I've sold at this location as well as the other two without this issue before. Anyway, I decided to stop in tonight because I was not going to yoga. I got there well before 6, but was faced with that familiar sign that they were no longer buying for the night. As my annoyance mounted, I patiently waited at the counter until I caught someone's attention. I was informed once again that they would be buying on Monday. So I explained how I had been in previously and called ahead and the owner piped up saying, \"I am the owner and I set the hours.\" Oh no she didn't! So I let her know that she might want to inform her staff to explain the stipulations over the phone. She then ranted on about her inventory and how she's getting ready for 'back to school.' And i care because??? And as I turned on my heel to leave, the young, messy-haired girl at the counter said, 'Here's a coupon.' \nRight. Like I'll be back for a 4th time; Three strikes - you're out...and outed on Yelp!
