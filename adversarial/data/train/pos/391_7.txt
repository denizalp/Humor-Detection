First timers, driving around the Summerlin area looking for something new. Heard about this place from many people, so we thought we'd give it a try. \n\nFOR HER: I ordered THE BLUE RIBBON -- the original with their special sauce. Came with lettuce, tomato, and pickled cucumbers (which was quite interesting). Wasn't too much of a fan of the signature blue ribbon sauce. It has a tinge of a mustard type taste... I also felt like the contents of the sandwich made the crispness of the chicken and bread go very soggy incredibly quick. Definitely no chik-fil-a. \n\nFOR HIM: He ordered the TENDER SUPREME -- 3 boneless tenders with a generous amount of skinny, crispy fries & a cup of coleslaw. The flavor of the batter was very tasty and paired very well with the variety of sauces, particularly the chipotle honey. I found all the sauces to be very interesting too, especially the wasabi honey and the brbbq sauce. If we ever come back, I'll probably opt to order this instead.\n\nBottom line: Not something I would go out of my way for, but their variety of sauces definitely was a nice signature twist. We are interested in trying the pulled chicken sandwich and the liver & onions next time if ever.
