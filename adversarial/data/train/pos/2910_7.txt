This place lost a star for their ridiculously limited delivery area. I live 1.2mi away and they won't deliver. I really don't see why, just add an extra dollar to the delivery charge. Ohio City problems.\n\n\nAnyway I ordered online with a coupon I was sent via email. It was SO cheap for so much food. You can track the progress online. So we saw that it said : \"Abigail put it in the oven\". Lol cool. Then less then 10mins later it was done?! I thought no way. So I went down there, sure enough it was all waiting for us! Thanks Abigail ;). We had a great girls night.\n\n1 medium pizza+Parmesan bites (really good!) + cinnasticks =$10.00!!!\n\nAbigail needs to put a tip jar on that counter!
