I was lucky enough to be part of the Groupon deal (thanks Christina P.) and picked up a Premium Pork Package at the Ahwatukee Farmers Market on Sunday.  The $50 package includes 2 pkgs (4 chops @ 1 inch thick) of Pork Chops, 1 pkg of Ham Steaks (or sliced for sandwiches), 1 pkg of smoked pulled pork, 1 pkg of bacon (choice of Regular, Peppercorn or Cottage).\n\nSeeing as how patience is a virtue that I do not have much of, that same afternoon, we made B.E.L.T.'s using the peppercorn bacon.  Wow-wee, was that peppery (i.e. not for the weaklings) but it sure was tasty!! \n\nA few days later we had pulled pork sandwiches for dinner.  Just as easy as the guy made it sound; defrost, warm, serve.  Quick and delicious, perfect for a weeknight dinner.  \n\nUp next the ham and the pork chops.  I can't wait!  Next time, I'll have to try some of the bratwurst (flavors include original, jalapeno, pineapple, garlic, and tomato basil).  Or maybe the breakfast sausage . . . \n\nLocal products + fresh food = money well spent, even if it is a little more expensive.  In the end that makes me slow down and appreciate my food a little more, which is another good thing! \n\nThis is win-win-win-win situation!  \nWell, maybe not so much for the pig.  :-(
