Ok let's start out by saying that this is a BBQ JOINT...there are not a lot, if any healthy options here...thank the Lord. If you want healthy...go somewhere else. \n\nWe came here for father's day and were in the mood to grub on some meat (the west wasn't won on salad...just sayin). Steven was our server and was very sweet, attentive and my little girl thought he was the bees knees. \n\nWe ordered quickly because we were starving and the attention span of a 3 and 2 year old is a bit much to be desired. \n\n-The burnt end appetizer was so yummy. Bits of brisket that were crispy and soft at the same time over a piece of white bread with their original BBQ sauce. Definitely recommend you start out with this. \n\n- Kids Mac and Cheese...the kids liked it...and that's all that matters :)\n\n- We each got a two meat combo...both with beef brisket, he got hot links and I got pork shoulder. I am not much of a sausage fan (hehehe...my dirty mind is kicking in) but it was pretty good. The pork was soft and shredded. Very flavorful but not healthy in the least (please refer to the top of this review). The beef brisket was yummy but it could have stood to have a bit more marbling (I am used to Texas brisket). Still very good. \n\n- The creamed corn is amazing...sweet, salty and creamy. A must have for the sides. \n\n- The mint chocolate chip brownie was very good...not earth shattering (this isn't Max Brenner when it comes to desserts) but definitely worth it if you have the room (the kids faces were covered in hot fudge). \n\nOverall a great time with my family. The prices aren't super cheap but the portions are good and the service is wonderful. Thank you Steven for a great time and we will be back to visit you for the country breakfast that you had mentioned.
