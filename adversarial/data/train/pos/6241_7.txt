It's extremely hard for me to give ONE star, but this Barro's makes it easy.  I'm actually planning to bump up my only another ONE star to a TWO star just to make this Barro's the joke of AZ.  But that would be dishonest and I don't do sh*t like that. \n\nTo the experience.  Came here one night for dinner with a former co-worker to eat and catch up.  This place was messy... what the hell is the staffs doing?? Talking about their crushes and gossiping???  Do they even work here?  Let's not even talk about the restroom.. I was once told how restroom is...usually tells you a lot about the kitchen, they're usually not far off from each other........GROSS!  Had I known this sooner I would have left before ordering. \n\nThe pizza was greasy and oily!  And with all that grease you would think the pizza would not feel and taste like cardboard with Campbell's Tomato Soup spilled over it....it did.  That night I starved, we could not finish a slice and didn't bother taking it home! \n\nDo all the other Barro's a favour and close down, if you keep up with this crap you'll drag them all through the mud.  This to your \"no firearm\" sign ::middle finger::\n\nOhhh and consider yourself lucky that my phone was dead, or I would had pictures!!
