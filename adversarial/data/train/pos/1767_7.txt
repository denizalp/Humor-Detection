Since this is the latest club in the latest and trendiest hotel I expected a lot more.  I got there around 1 am (pretty late) so here was no line.  I went to ask the bounce how much it was going be to get in and he said it was $20 for ladies and $40 for guys.  Standard pricing for Vegas so i didn't mind.  When we got inside I was not impressed by the decor, or lack of.  I am used to clubs like Tao, XS, Rain and Tryst where there is a theme decor or a pool, or some sort of view of the strip.  This place looked like an underground shipping warehouse.  So far, not pleased.  I went to the bar and ordered 2 drinks that cost me $35.  Seriously?  All you have to do is pour Grey Goose into a shot glass and you're charging me $35????  That is way steep, even for Vegas.\n\nAfter we were there for about 20 minutes, Timbaland started performing on the tiny little stage they have in the middle of the dance floor.  OMG did that system SUCK?!?!  I guess the DJs use a different set of speakers than the performers do.  It was fine when the DJ was spinning but when Timbaland was performing the speakers sounded like they were blown (I'm in the audio\/video industry, I know a crappy system when I hear it) and the amp on the sub was cranked up way too high.  If I was a performer there, I'd be insulted and walk off the stage.\n\nUsually I love live performances but honestly, the sound  system was so bad I couldn't wait for the performance to be over.  The DJ came back on and we headed out to the dance floor,  It is the size of my living room.  Sad. \n\nDo yourselves a favor folks.  Don't come here.  Vegas has so many better clubs this one,  Don't waste your time.  Go to XS.
