Used to be Oggie's Pizza. Same place, just a little touched up. Went there for lunch on a Saturday afternoon. Nachos were more of a salad concoction, like a taco salad, with the most bland salsa I've ever tasted- Tasted like thick tomato juice! Had a roast beef sandwich, which was toasted and I was never asked if I wanted it toasted, which I would have said no! In fact, it was burnt, I mean black! Couldn't taste the cheese, was dry as a board, had no sauce, lettuce, tomato, mayo, etc. etc. Wife had a antipasto salad with really vinegar-y vegetables, very little lettuce, and a bunch of cold cuts wrapped together with cheese. It was hardly a salad. I'd have to say the food was less than mediocre, verging on pretty bad! What's a bummer is that the pizza joint on Mcdowell Mountain ranch that  changed locations was actually pretty good, and this place simply isn't any good at all. Blecch! The bar is nice, there's lot's of room, space, and plenty of TV's. I might go back here to have a beer & watch a game. I'll never eat here again.
