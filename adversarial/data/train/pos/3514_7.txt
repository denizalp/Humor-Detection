Definitely a cute cute cute atmosphere. Nice big veranda with couches tables and chairs. Have not even seen the inside yet. \n\nBut I ask you Island Cafe, why are the grilled cheese sandwiches ONLY for children?? But if you add a tomato slice onto the sandwich and a dollar onto the price (you seemed to just make this weird rule up on the spot) then it is suddenly fit for adult consumption? This is wacky and makes no sense. I hate things that don't make any sense!
