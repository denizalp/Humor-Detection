Came here on a Sunday.  Place isn't very inviting from the outside.  Couldn't even tell where the front door was.  Bartender was super nice but definitely catered to the regulars at the end of the bar.  Ordered wings and a mid-well burger.  Everything was undercooked.  Burger was still bloody inside.  I like that but my lil one doesn't.  Hence, the mid-well ordering.  Wings were still rubbery.  Sent em back to get cooked longer.  No biggie, but they didn't re-season em when they came back out.  So, dry wings it was.  Yumm.  Charged for extra sauce which I thought was kinda lame but whatever.  Only thing that would keep me coming back was a pretty damn good beer selection and the bloody marys were killer.  So, just do Sunday Funday with the booze and eat at home...
