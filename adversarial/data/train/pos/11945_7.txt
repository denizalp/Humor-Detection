I was surprised by how small this store is.  I guess I'm used to mattress stores that carry many brands and need more space.  But the store was big enough to hold all the models they sell.\n\nThe mattress we've been sleeping on is only about two years old, bought at Sears, high-end, one of the S brands (Sealy, Simmons, Serta - I think they're all one company now).  It's just awful, and Sears won't do anything for us.  \n\nWhen we got to the store the lone salesperson was wrapping up a sale to a couple who was attempting to apply for financing for the mattress they were buying.  It took an inordinate amount of time, and there was nothing we could do except hang around and wait, since we didn't know how the system worked.  Once they left, the saleswoman was very helpful, knowledgeable, and patient.  We tried all the models and finally settled on their middle grade, which felt more comfortable to me than the highest-priced one - still no bargain :(  \n\nI sure hope that once it's delivered it'll be as comfy as it seemed in the store.  I collect mattresses like shoes, and have a warehouse-worth full of mattresses that seemed oh-so-comfortable until I got it home.  Unlike shoes, however, mattresses cost a lot more (unless you're into Jimmy Choo or Christian Louboutin, in which case it's debatable).  If they'd had another salesperson working in the store, I would have given this five stars, but they didn't.
