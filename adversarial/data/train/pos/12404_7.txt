Saturday night, prowling around the Mekong Plaza. I was sadly disappointed by the Tet festival. Determined to have fun regardless I decided to check owhat else the plaza had to offer. I'm glad that I did because this place is filled with hidden gems.\n\nI was drawn in by the window advertisement for boba\/bubble tea. I had seen this before on one or another of the discovery\/travel channel shows.\n\nAfter staring at the board forever and asking the poor kid at the register for recommendations I grabbed a honeydew with boba. \n\nThe drink was very fresh and did not taste as if it had added sugar. The boba was a fun experience with a hard to explain the texture. I would say its almost like gummy bear texture but in little round balls. After a few drinks of mine I recruited a friend to come and try another flavor. He got the coconut\/pineapple which was the other flavor I almost got. He had zero complaints about his and liked it very much.\n\nThe food the other patrons ordered looked and smelled amazing. I wish that I had some more room in me so that I could give it a try. Their menu is HUGE and the prices are very reasonable. I want to get back here sometime with a decent sized group to get a large variety of items.\n\nThe front of the store was manned by a Mom,son, and daughter team who were all very nice. The lady even gave this little girl a free bubble tea while I was there.\n\nThis could easily be upgraded to a 4+ star if the food tastes as good as it smells.
