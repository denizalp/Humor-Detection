Okay I want to like this place and only giving two stars is really hard! The sushi was fresh and nice portions and the wildfire and sweet tomato are my new fave rolls.... But....\nThe service was below average. Felt uncomfortable there. And it didn't help that the guy, who based on other yelpers picks might be the owner was rude! I ordered a Snow White to him, he took my order then walked away. 10 min later I realized he wasn't coming back and didn't tell other chef about my order so I had to order it again. Our rolls were good but based on other yelpers picks who know him, we got short sticked on our presentation... I like the radish noodles with my sushi! \nThen they don't do half rolls and with all you can eat there are so many limitations. I agree with other yelpers that with all those limitations I can go somewhere else! Only certain appetizers are included in all you can eat, you can only do one each of the rolls with no rice, and because of those rolls I had to pay dinner price at lunch time. \nI really want to like this place as they had good selection and all. But I didn't feel comfy... When chef gave me attitude when I said most places have a tiger roll and it's good I was like what??? And they weren't very nice to my kid who loves sushi and loves sitting at the bar cause most places make it fun for her! So due to all that I gave two for quality of fish and selection but when I go out I want to enjoy myself!
