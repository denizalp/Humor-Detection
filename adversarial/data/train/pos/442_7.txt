This is one of those places that you wouldn't think might be kind of questionable, but is actually pretty nice.  It's right next to a gas station which doesn't help with that image, nor does the parking situation. but once you get inside it has the atmosphere of a neighborhood diner.  The food was very well done, very fresh and tasty.  The chicken club was very good, with the cheese melted all over it.  The only thing that could have really been improved upon was the service.  The girls looked bored and like they didn't really want to be there.  But then again they also looked like they were in high school, and trying to make teenagers happy is a pointless effort.
