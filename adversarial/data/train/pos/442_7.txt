This building used to be a karate studio. The building is very unique and always appealed to me. It is now a classic Neapolitan pizza place. The pizza is excellent. It is nice to not have to drive to the east side for Crostatas or Vero for a good pie. I highly recommend coming to Harlow's. Happy to see Madison being developed with great businesses like this instead of empty karate studios.
