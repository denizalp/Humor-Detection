Surprising it the best way to describe Lobster Me. Not sure but this seems to be a food truck concept that is now brick and mortar ? This walk up mall location offers a wide variety of all things Lobster indulgent. \nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/lobster-me-miracle-mile-shops-las-vegas#JDyPbRNg_ctDq6kfOnkx5g\n It's like Forrest Gump for Lobster. Lobster Rolls,Lobster Mac'n cheese, Lobster grilled cheese sammie,   Lobster Bisque, Lobster Tacos, Lobster deep fried, Lobster salad and what ?  Lobster ice cream( oh yes that too).  \n\nTo be clear even though it's a walk up order counter, don't expect cheap prices. The 2 Lobster taco combo will set you back $17 but the are well worth the splurge for fast casual dining. Large and fluffy chunks of freshly steamed lobster meat fill the taco. \nThese are not \"langostinos\" or left over rubbery stuff often passed off as lobster, this is bona fide lobby goodness. Squeeze that lime onto the sweet spot of the taco with the cabbage, pico, and some of their chipotle cream sauce and oh my. \nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/lobster-me-miracle-mile-shops-las-vegas#XGE7RtVxumyCtrmgyAxwhw\nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/lobster-me-miracle-mile-shops-las-vegas#9yhob1WCQSRGkIa5x2RWjg\n\nSurprising to say the least. I wish I had a bigger appetite when I was there but this was mid afternoon, pre-dinner snack that two of us shared and it was perfect.   I will go back and try the other goodies next time I am in town. Wonder when these are gonna make their Cali debut?
