If there was an option for zero stars, I would have used it. This is without a doubt the worst experience I have ever had with an accountant. They had my taxes for over a year and not only did nothing with them, but were unreachable 99% of the time I tried to get any answers. When I finally got a response, it was always \"they will be ready next week.\" I can not stress strongly enough to stay away from this 'business'.
