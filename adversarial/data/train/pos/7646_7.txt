I'm so unbelievably annoyed with Macy's. Particularly this Macy's and the absolute lack of knowledge by their sales people. You would think people dealing in fine jewelry would know what the F they're talking about. \n\nMy mom bought me these diamond hoop earrings for Xmas and I took them to exchange for a pair of diamond earrings. The sales lady was nice (kinda pressured me..but in a nice way..she dealt with all my going back and forth). Ultimately, I opted for some diamond earrings that were on clearance (they were still $400 so it's not like I'm not droppin bills). The lady convinces me to buy the extended warranty specifically saying that it covers my earrings being converted into screwbacks - a necessity for earrings. So I finally said okay. I told her I'd bring them back to get them done since I wanted to wear them on New Years and my bday. \n\nSo I take them in last week and the ladies working the counter were nice enough to help me out. I'm pretty sure she even confirmed that my earrings would be taken care of FREE of charge since I already purchased the extended warranty. \n\nFast forward to today. Joyce calls me (I'm not sure if she's the one who took my earrings when I came in to get them serviced) to tell me she has an estimate. What?  Estimate for what? My earrings?!?!?! Well apparently Macys will only cover the screwbacks if the earrings are over $1,500. Why the F didn't anyone tell me that before? So no. I don't want to pay $130 for my earrings to be serviced. I'm sure I can find somewhere far less expensive to get them done. Oh wait, so now I'm not going to have my earrings back for another week. FUCKING A. I'm beyond irritated. \n\nMacys has been steadily declining over the years and this has just been the icing on the cake. This is why I will always shop at Nordstrom. Their customer service is far beyond any other major retailer. Macys can keep their stupid sales and their stupid customer service. I'm over it.
