New place!  Don't bother it was horrible. \nThe only thing that was good was the cole slaw.  I ordered the white meat chicken plate. It looked amazing but it had no seasoning whatsoever.  The potato salad was polluted  by sugar.  Who puts sugar in potato salad???  My son ordered the shrimp platter and it was ok but the hush puppies and fries also very bland(do they season anything). The kicker was the banana pudding...... OMG it was absolutely Horrible. It was fake flavored  jello pudding.  Not a banana in sight. Hate I wasted my money.   #Oneanddone
