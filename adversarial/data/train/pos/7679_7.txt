There is nothing better when you are hungover than a trip to Monterrey Mexican Restaurant. Chips + salsa + cheese dip = miracle cure.\n\nIn terms of the Monterreys here, I would rank this one second behind the Matthews location. I still think that one has better salsas than the others. This Monterrey does have a good sized patio, though.\n\nMonterrey has a lunch menu that runs from 11am-3pm. They also have different specials every day. I pretty much order anything that's covered in cheese dip.... chimichangas (I recommend getting them soft instead of fried) or pollo fundido. My friend Andrea always gets fajitas. That's pretty much her go-to at every Mexican restaurant. Starter wise, you get complimentary chips and salsa. I go cheese dip over guac because I feel like their guac doesn't have that much flavor. \n\nIt by no means is the best Mexican food in Charlotte, but it's a solid option for the price. It's not fancy. You'll smell like Mexican food after you leave. It's a big hit with the college kids in the University area. The last time I was here, a party of about 30 sorority girls came in for dinner and drinks. The staff didn't miss a beat with the large group. \n\nMy only complaint about Monterrey is that there isn't a convenient location for me. I'm near uptown, so I have to drive to Matthews or Monterrey to get my fix. Monterrey, if you can hear me, feel free to build in my 'hood. And by 'hood, I mean my front yard. Hell, you can even set up shop in my garage.
