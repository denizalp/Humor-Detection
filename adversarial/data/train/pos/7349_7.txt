DISGUSTING and UNSANITARY!!!\n\nIs it possible to give a restaurant NO STARS?\n\nI've gone to this restaurant a few times since inception at the Puente Hills Mall location and the more I come to eat, the worse the customer base becomes and the more disgusted I get.\n\nWhile people were standing in line to be seated, they have already started eating with their hands - that means that bacteria they have on their hands will transfer to the serving spoons when to go for their seconds, thirds, fourths....  Then there's these people who are so happily thinking how cool it is to hold their strawberries before sticking them to the chocolate fountain... AGAIN, it's called \"spreading germs, people.\"  The staff sees these issues and don't correct or replace the food.\n\nI will never go to this place again.\n\nManuel R. is correct, their name should be changed to GHETTO CORRAL.
