When I drive by my girlfriend's work, my heart breaks a little bit every time. My favorite bbq of Arizona came to a quiet end a few years ago and my stomach has never recovered, and at times I want to refuse Jruggs ever shut down.  I had dreamed of filling the wall with notations of the times I had finished multiple full racks of their ribs with photos of my gluttonous glory, but alas, only a single lonely notation remains upon the walls inside dated February 12th, 2010.  Sometimes I drive by at night and hold a candle in memory of all the good times there.  This grown man has no shame in crying over his lost bbq love!\n\nSo with that said, I'm not entirely sure how I feel about Dickey's.  I feel like this is sort of like how you break up with a totally awesome chick, and if you fly solo long enough you start counting nickels as dime pieces.  The first time I went, the ribs were fatty, godawful, completely lacking in any sense of smokiness, with their redeeming items being their fried okra and decent, tangy sauce.  Subsequent visits have discovered the wonder of their Spicy Cheddar sausage, Onion Tanglers, Waffle Fries, and other sides, with their ribs still being hit or miss.  If there were other BBQ places in the vicinity I'd probably be eager for an upgrade, but with this being whats available I come here once a week with my gf.  They seem to have replaced some of their more slow working employees, with service being much faster than previously.  \n\nAll in all, lots of places can do better, but lots of places do worse, and no other places are in a comfortable vicinity for a work lunch break, so if thats what you are doing, then this is a good place to go versus the plethora of other chains in the area.
