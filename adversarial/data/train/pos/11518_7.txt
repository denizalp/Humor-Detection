I randomly ended up in Cave Creek one day and being vegan, I was very excited to stumble upon this place.  I'm happy to check out any vegan restaurant!  Yes. the food is good.  But for the amount you get, it's really over priced.   Over prices and pretentious.  It's also not too fun being handed a binder for a menu but being told you can only order from the back cover of 5 or 6 options.  The meal sizes are appetizer size at best.  I left feeling so hungry and unsatisfied after spending $15 for the \"pizza\".   I had to laugh at the Life's Paradox essay all over the walls - they're all misquoted as being said by the Dalai Lama.  The person who compared this place to a bad episode of Portlandia is dead on!
