Great chocolates and so much to choose from!! The chocolates are made in town. My guy and I always get the box of chocolates. It is worth it because you get to try a variety of the truffles, the caramels, and their signature pieces. They are great for presents too! I want to go back and get their dark chocolate bars and hazelnut chocolate!
