This spot kind of let me down.  Don't get me wrong the space is cool and the employees are awesome but the food just was a bit underwhelming.   I was staying near by and they open early so with the great reviews I decided to buy a Yellow desk (damn spell checker Yelp Deal argg) and get $20 greenies for $14.  Sounded good so I walked in and looked over the menu and decided that a juice and açaí bowl would be perfect.  They also had a special where you could get a $2 power bar if you ordered a bowl or juice so basically I got that all for $14.   \n\nI got the beetle  juice first and it was kind of small for $8-9 bucks but it was tasty.  It had beats and carrot ginger lemon celery and apple.  Sucked that puppy down pretty quickly before I got the açaí bowl number three that had coconut milk and strawberries with the açaí and coconut and blueberries on top.\n\nAgain I was surprised how small it looked when delivered.  It felt more like I was getting more of a gelato cup size than a bowl.  My smiley face sunk a bit but then I realized I got a Yelp deal and I want starving or anything so I would survive.  \n\nThe açaí was a bit too soft for my taste and it seemed a bit watered down, the pineapple was a little droopy. The Rawnola bar was the best part of the meal.\n\nOverall I'm not sure I'll be back with the many juice options in Chandler.  They did have a Bloody Mary type juice that looked interesting and I may try that out sometime but the Bowls are no bueno..:(
