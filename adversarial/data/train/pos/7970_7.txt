I love this restaurant, it's authentic, it's a no frills, good food deli.  You can't go wrong, every visit I'm greeted with sour pickles and speedy service!  I've only eaten the Reuben because I can't order anything else when I sit down and a big basket of French fries!  Fresh cut potatoes, crispy fried, cooked to perfection and served piled high!  Hell yeah.
