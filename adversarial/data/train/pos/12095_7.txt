Love this place! My only regret is that it isn't located closer to me so I could go more often! Also, the location is pretty shady so I'd only go during the day and if you have a nice, fancy car, better opt out to ride with a friend (you'll see what I mean when you go there lol). My favorite items from here include the curries, crispy chicken, and green tea buns. \n\nI've tried the yellow, massaman, and panang curries and I highly recommend getting them if you love curry and coconut milk. The flavors are much more apparent in the curry compared to other Thai places I've been to and this is an example of a situation in which I rather get less in quantity, but more in quality. A to go order of the curry is good for 2 meals (and trust me, I eat a good amount) and the dish still retains its good taste even after being subjected to the microwave!\n\nIf you haven't done so yet, you gotta try the crispy chicken! I've ordered it a couple of times already and it was almost always super crispy and yummy. The most recent time I ordered it, the shell wasn't as crispy and the flavor wasn't as strong. I'm going to give them the benefit of the doubt and say it was an off day. \n\nLast but not least, the green tea buns! I haven't seen it listed on the menu, but I always ask for it when I'm there. The bread is fluffy and pairs well with the light green tea cream in the middle. I normally don't like cream since it is usually thick and overly sweet, but the cream they make here is so good! I could easily eat 2-3 of these in one sitting, but I usually buy 4-5 of them and eat one after each meal. They cost $1 each. \n\nOverall, I highly recommend checking this place out. The staff is very nice and the food is awesome! What more could you want?
