One of the best restaurants in Scottsdale. The private booths and the views of the city are breathtaking too. We loved the Alaskan King Crab Legs which are already removed from the shells for you and served in a huge heap. The Scallops and Oysters were top shelf. This is a romantic spot that requires you dressing up just a little. Pre-dinner try the bar, hit the Casino after dinner if you're feeling lucky.
