Stayed here for one night while on a road trip.\nThe size of the rooms were ok. Not the cleanest, but not unbearable.\nThe problem was the smell. A mix of old cigarettes (yes, it's a non smoking room) and perfume. It got even worse when we turned on the air conditioning.\nThe walls are so thin that you can hear the neighbors snore.\nDo not try to wash your hair if you have long thick hair. The pressure in the shower is so low, that you will miss out on the rest of Vegas while trying to get the shampoo out.\n\nThe pool is very nice tough!\nAll in all - you get what you pay for.
