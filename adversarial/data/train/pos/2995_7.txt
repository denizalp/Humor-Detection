Five guys offers a basic selection of burgers, sandwiches, and hot dogs, with a plethora of toppings to choose from, free of charge! You can choose between a two patty burger (The regular size), or the \"little\" one patty size. Fries can either be plain or tasty Cajun style. \n\nI went with a \"little\" bacon cheeseburger. Don't let the moniker fool you- there is nothing little about this burger! It was a sizable portion of beef, with fresh, tasty ingredients. We also split a medium size order of Cajun fries.\n\nI went with \"all the way\" minus mayo, and added jalapeno. \"All the way\" means basic ingredients you would typically find in your burger, outlined in black on the menu board. Such ingredients include mustard, ketchup, lettuce, pickles, tomato, grilled onion, grilled mushroom, and mayo. The more non-traditional toppings are outlined in red on the menu board, and include jalapeno, relish, and A1 sauce. \n\nService was fast and friendly, and my burger and fries were made in no time.\n\nThe burger was nicely grilled, and the veggies were fresh and crisp. Even the jalapeno was fresh and thinly sliced. It packed a punch! The bacon was the equivalent of 1 strip on the burger, which was cooked nice and crisp. The grilled onions were a nice addition, but if you order them on your burger don't expect a lot of caramelized flavor on them since they'll taste a little more steamed than grilled.\n\nThe fries were delicious. The Cajun spice mix dusting them were a good addition. The medium size is a good size if you are sharing with someone.\n\nThe drink fountain is the cool \"create your own\" soda machine, with a multitude in diet and regular options. Orange flavored mello yello? Lime ginger ale? Vanilla diet barqs? Yes please!\n\nPlus, any place that plays The Ramones in their restaurant is A-OK in my book!
