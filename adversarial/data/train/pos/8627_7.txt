I had such high hopes for Matt's Big Breakfast, but I left unimpressed and really disappointed.\n\nWhy only 3 stars? Service, food options and coffee. \n\nService\nMy sister and I visited at 9am to avoid long waits, and it was perfect the entire restaurant was pretty much empty. With that being said, I expected decent service but nope. Our waitress, Michelle, wasn't very kind and didn't welcome us when she first arrived to our table. She also never once checked on us during our meal. And instead of saying thank you when she dropped off the check, she just put it on our table and walked away. I wish I could've given the tip to the manager, I think his name was David, instead of her. He checked on us AND picked up the dirty dishes. \n\nCoffee\nOh my god, the coffee was just terrible. Very bitter, I couldn't even finish half the cup. \n\nFood options\nEverything has Pig products and you can't substitute anything for those products. We had to say no bacon and pay full price for another side (hash browns). Instead of just switching them out like they do at every other restaurant. \n\nSo.. why did I even give them 3 stars instead of 2 or 1?\nThe manager did a great job checking on us, the whole place was spotless, the food was good (especially the strawberry jam) and I feel like being nice.\n\nWould I recommend Matt's Big Breakfast? No way! And I will NOT be returning.
