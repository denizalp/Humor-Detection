Introducing me to Swatow was one of the best things an ex-bf has ever done for me. I've been frequenting Swatow for over 15 years and it's never let me down. It's basic and to-the-point Chinese food with no nonsense service. It's oftentimes busy so don't be alarmed if you're asked to share a table. I'd rather share than wait. \n\nGet the Shrimp with Lobster Sauce, Shrimp Wonton Noodle Soup, Stuffed Tofu, Stuffed Eggplant and the General Tso's Chicken. \n\nThey don't take Debit or Credit here so make sure to bring cash. Also, don't be surprised if you see Susur Lee here late at night. He comes here often and he always gets the noodle soups.
