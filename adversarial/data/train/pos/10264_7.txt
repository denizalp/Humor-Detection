This company did work on my house.  I was unhappy and they were rude when I stopped any future work. They threatened to sue me if I left a negative review. I even received an email and a letter from their law firm. They offered me $500 if I would be quiet.  I did not take the money.  My lawyer informed me it is free speech. They charged me over $18,000 to remove mold from 2 very small bathrooms and 1 wall, and  1 double cabinet (bottom section of cabinets only) in the kitchen (all 3 walls backed up to each other).  They did no replacement work.  I would never use them again.  It was a very bad experience for me.
