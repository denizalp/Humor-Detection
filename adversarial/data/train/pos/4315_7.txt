So I've been here a couple times and also did a full size blog praising The Yellow Chilli and how I felt it was one of the better Sanjeev Kapoor restaurants. But last night at TYC changed everything. I take back my words and possibly also going to edit my blog. \n\nThe chicken that we ordered (lazeez murgh) was extremely dry and chewy. I've had the other chicken dishes earlier and felt the same thing. Too dry. It was totally overcooked to the point where the pieces had shrunk. We sent the chicken back and the manager who also calls himself a chef gets all defensive and says that it's dry cos the pieces are breast pieces. \n\nOne advice on cooking:  maybe next time use a whole chicken or cook with the skin on. Go boneless and skinless, and you're basically asking for a dry, stringy piece of meat.\n\nAnother piece of advice: maybe next time accept your mistake, say sorry and try to correct it instead of getting defensive and giving lame excuses. \n\nThat was not the first excuse of the night. When we asked him to get use garlic naan instead of the Pyaaz Mirch ki Roti cos the roti was too hard to chew, he responded saying that is because we let the roti get cold before eating. \n\nForget correcting their mistake, at the end of the night when I had to pay for the meal I see that I was charged full price for having literally two bite size pieces of chicken and also the roti.\n\nEAT AT YOUR OWN RISK
