Been looking forward to the opening of this place since Zen 32 closed and had lunch there today. The atmosphere was modern and airy, and service was very good.  It would be a cool place to have a drink at the bar later in the day.  Nice patio and lots of big windows that were open to let in light and fresh air on this unusually overcast day in Phoenix.  I thought the food was decent, but not remarkable, and it's a bit pricy for lunch.  It is however, a great spot for business lunches\/drinks. \n\nI wish them well but unfortunately I won't be dining there again as long as they continue to serve fois gras. If you're not  familiar with fois gras, I won't elaborate; just know that it's a delicacy so cruelly-derived that it's banned in many countries as well as the state of Califormia and the city of Chicago. It's my personal decision to not support restaurants where it's served.  \n\nMake a small change to the menu and I'll be back....
