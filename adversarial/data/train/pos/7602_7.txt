YUM FREAKING OH MY LORD.\n\nWe ordered a cake online to be delivered over the weekend...but then the delivery cost double the cost of the cake, so we went in store to pick it up. \n\nWe strolled in, and it was empty. As soon as we spoke to the ...person? baker? girl? shop keep? ..it suddenly brought in like 12 people behind us. We got a cake, and we also decided to have a cuppa and a tart.\n\nWe chose the key lime tart, I had an earl grey tea, and my friend had the peppermint. Delicious tea. But who cares. THE TART WAS FREAKING AMAZING. The creme was delicious. The chocolatey base was heavenly, and who wudda thunk to put em togethz?\n\nAnd on to the cake. We ordered a large chocolate truffle cake, which is 44 dollars. WORTH. EVERY. PENNY.\n\nI've attached it to the photos, but you can't really tell much.\n\nLemme just break it down for you. Cake. Ganache. Cake. Ganache. Cake. Covered in Ganache. Then dipped in like chocolate or something. Covered in truffles.\n\nYes.\n\nMagic.\n\nChoco-overdose? Please, that ain't possbile, but came pretty close.\n\nCan't wait to try everything else on the menu.\n\nAlso, its so cheap imo.\n\nTHe total bill (with the cake, tart, 2 teas) was like 52.\n\n\nYes dufflet. Yes.
