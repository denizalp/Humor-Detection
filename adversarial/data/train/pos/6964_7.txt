My favourite uptown bar.  Some of the reviewers have missed the point:  it IS MEANT TO BE a gathering place for hard-core soccer\/football\/futbol\/fussball\/voetbal fans!  We're loud, we're partisan, we're involved--and if you're not, DON\"T GO THERE!  That's like spending the evening at \"Uptown Cabaret\" if you're offended by nearly naked women!\n\nThe beer list is as large as it needs to be; Christian and Mark are friendly, are very capable owners\/bartenders and are very knowledgeable about the game!  For a soccer fan--what more is there?
