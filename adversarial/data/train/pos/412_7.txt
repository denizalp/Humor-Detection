Coffee is good, service is good.  The food looks good too.  This has more of a relaxed feel than Starbucks and as pretty full at about 10:30 am.  There are regular tables and couches set up which make it easy to get to meet new people.  I saw several people introducing themselves to the person next to them, asking where they were from, etc.  This place is pretty cool in the fact that it has this friendly atmosphere.  Just a nice place to hang out, meet new people, bring your own group or just relax and read the paper or do some paperwork.
