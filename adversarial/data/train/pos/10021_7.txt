This is a tough one.  I think this place is more like a 3.5.  Service is very competent.  It didn't feel very welcoming last time, but it was ok, nothing bad, just kind of cold.  I love the salad, but I can also get it at their sister restaurant. I have been here at least 4 times and it has all been good, but not enough to make me want to drive this long.  My husband had a humongous burgers, he liked it.  I had a bite and it was very good.  The margarita they have on HH is a little weird tasting, so we won't have that one again.
