Fantastic drink menu. Very well thought out and lots of attention to detail.  I was there last night and the drinks were amazing.  I just saw a few negative reviews below, but I don't think you can judge a place on it's opening week.  A line out the door and a 5-deep bar with people is a good problem to have, albeit an initial inconvenience.  Things will calm down after a few weeks.  They should give it another chance.  \n\nSo, glad this bar is finally open!  Phoenix needed a place like this!  Thanks, Ross!
