I probably shouldn't be allowed to review the Western given how, um, inebriated I was when I was there last February. But actually, inebriated is the best way to experience the Western. This ain't the kind of casino that you come to Vegas for, but if you're an aficionado of \"dirty Vegas\" like I am, it's the kind of casino that keeps you coming back.\n\nThe Western is a few blocks from the Fremont Street Experience on the other side of the new \"Fremont East\" district. I highly recommend a few drinks at the Griffin or one of the other bars before you head to the Western. Get a nice buzz on, amble over to the Western, and play some $1 blackjack. The drinks will keep coming pretty regularly, and if you've had a few before you come, you won't notice how bad the well liquor is. \n\nOh. And wash your hands when you leave. Seriously, you don't know where those chips have been.
