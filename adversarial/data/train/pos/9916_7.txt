If your nickname is Summer's Eve because you're that much of a douche, this place is for you. This hotel was made for douchebags. A douchebag hotel has receptionists that only talk to you if your breast are hanging out and at their eye level, table limits that start at $25, $50 but has more penny slot machines than Binion's, and charges $40 a ticket for a concert where you are standing in a drained wading pool with no way for the patrons to cool off in the hot vegas weather.  \n\n\nThe only redeeming factors of this hotel\/casino are Holsteins Shakes and Buns and Skins 62.
