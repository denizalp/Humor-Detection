Ok so this streetcar sucks, primarily because it's slow as hell but I don't think it's worst than all the other routes. The 509 Bathurst makes my skin crawl, the 506 College is non-existant and don't get me started on the newly rectified 504 King which now actually runs without shuttle bus.\n\nI don't know... my experiences with the 501 have been not so bad in comparison to those other routes but by no means is it perfect. It's notoriously packed, the clustering is laughable and since it's such a long route when it breaks down everything seems to be at a standstill.
