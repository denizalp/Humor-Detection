So healthy, Doctors want you to stay home......\n\nThere is a great variety of healthy foods and beverages here, and an incredibly nice owner.  Yes, Daily Kitchen is in the old Rachel's spot, but it is not Rachels.  The decor has been updated and the seating in the room has been efficiently designed.  \n\nA huge draw here, is the seating outside between The Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf.  If you have a really nice car, chances are you probably come here (Judging by the parking lot)  If you don't have a nice car, come here anyways, the food tastes good, even in your rusty El Camino.\n\nI enjoyed the spicy Thai Chicken Wrap on my visit.  The dressing was so wonderful.  It had great flavor and heat, and was light.  My only complaint about the wrap, was that the dressing was all at the bottom, and the way the ingredients were mixed in, there were some bites which didn't feature all the fillings.  I love Cilantro, but a few bites were pure Cilantro which was overwhelming.  Still, I felt healthy while eating it, and it filled me up.\n\n\nCome check out Daily Kitchen and Wellness Bar, your body doesn't need another McGriddle....or does it?
