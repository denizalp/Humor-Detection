So Ive been to Chilli's several times, and I am not a big fan of there food! \n\nIve ordered several different items such as there mouth bite burgers, there chicken fried steak, and the ribs...So Ive definitely given them plenty of chances every visit I have been disappointed!!! It taste like a microwavable dinner! Food is rubbery and tasteless! YUCK \n\nOn the other hand I do still return for the bar! \n\nI must admit I do LOVE there appetizers\/drinks!!! \n\nI LOVE there Southwestern Eggrolls mmm mmm good so yummy!!! There stuffed with chicken,black beans,corn and jalapeno jack cheese, and is served with this delicious avocado ranch dressing. \n\nI also love there Crispy Onion Strings & Jalapeno Stack very very tasty especially after having a few Presidente Margaritas! MMMM I love the Presidente Margaritas they come in a shaker and you can poor as you go and there very delicious! \n\nSo overall this place is great if your just coming for some snacks and some drinks, unless your a fan of microwavable food!
