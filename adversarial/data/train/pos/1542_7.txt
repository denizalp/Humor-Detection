So disappointing, it states that McFaddens is a 49ers bar but then they play the Colts volume in game on the big screen and refuses to turn the volume on for the 49ers. And I've had nothing but issues with food 3 weeks in a row Joe the manager did make the food right took a couple of tries. Just so disappointed will not be back if your 49ers  Niner fan don't come here.
