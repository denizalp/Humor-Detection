Fitness Center: Nautilus strength equipment. Nautilus and Matrix cardio.\n\nHotel: I have to preface this review: this hotel should come with a note before you stay here, there will be kids running around - people that are NOT dressed in Gucci - room that do not have refrigerators - rooms that are outdated yet comfortable. The other reviewers are probably looking at this hotel as a luxury hotel from where they live, but if you want to experience Vegas stay on the strip and spend more money to stay near the action. This hotel seems more like a Holiday Inn than a Vegas hotel...
