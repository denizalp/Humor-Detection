READ THE WARRANTY!!!  We had a pool installed several years ago and the Pebble Tech cracked.  The warranty was only for FIVE YEARS and any other company is for the LIFETIME of the pool.  We were responsible for the cost of the repair, which was several hundred dollars.  Now I am concerned about the rest of my pool due to this installation issue that showed up later on down the road.  I would have thought for the cost of the pool that they would have been a stand up company and taken care of it.  I could not even get a return call from the owner.
