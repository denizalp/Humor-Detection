Alright so I decided to check this spot out it's nearby my house and I'm kind of into the whole vaping thing right now. So I stop in to try some flavors check the shop out. So first when I walk in I see the little koi fish pond don't quite understand why that's there but it's cool. Then I notice an empty dish looks like someone had lunch and forgot to pick it up. To me that's kind of gross I understand if you're the only one in the shop someone  comes in whatever but it shouldn't just be sitting out. Whatever I get over it. We tried the flavors out. I personally am a fan of the space jams so I saw they carried them cool. However they were out not a big deal those flavors always sell out. I try the other flavors. A few weren't that bad but I didn't find one not even one where I was like wow I liked it. Extremely disappointed. I didn't bother to check the prices on the mods had some nice mods on display. Nice selection of drop tips. Customer service was standard. Probably not going to stop in again.
