Omg what a great restaurant!! I am in awe with this place. No wonder that they are among the best restaurants in Canada(no 34 out of 100 in 2017). Hubby took me here for my birthday. We took the 5 service tasting menu with wine pairing. We could of gotten the 8 service for a little more but I don't eat that much and most of the time, Felix helps me finish my plates lol! Our waitress Marie-Alex was extraordinary! She was so amazing that it only made the evening so much more memorable. For example: there was a course in the 8 service that we really wanted to try and she made it happen for us for only a 10$ extra (for both. Not each!). EVERYTHING was on point and delicious. From the bread and butter to the last crumb in the dessert! This restaurant is a \"special occasion\" restaurant for us due to the price. But boy it's so worth it!!!
