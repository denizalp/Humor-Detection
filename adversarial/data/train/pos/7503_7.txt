Magic show? No. I think there were a total of 4 tricks during the whole 1.5 hour show...and I'd seen them all before! On top of that most were easy to figure out how they were done. \n\nThe show consisted mainly of weird dancing and horrible little plots with bad acting. I was expecting some unique and awe-inducing tricks but was left thinking \"what the hell just happened here?\"\n\nWe did, however, get the tickets for free after a grueling 4 hour time share presentation. It sucks that we spent so much time doing that, but I'm extremely relieved that we didn't shell out any dough to see this crap!\n\nTo top it all off I had an actual nightmare about the show that night! I woke up with my heart pounding and scared out of my mind after having this freaky nightmare about the fake bunnies that were used in the show!\n\nSave you money and time, and skip this one.
