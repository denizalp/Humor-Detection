This has got to be hands down the best sushi I have had in Pittsburgh. They have a great happy hour 7 days a week (available in the bar only). I went twice last week because I just couldn't get enough. On the first visit, I had a selection of sushi and seaweed salad, and on the second, I had a kitchen entree in the dining area (not hibachi station).\n\nThe Y2K roll is just divine. It has tempura shrimp (the shrimp was fresh, crunchy, and still warm when the roll arrived to me), minced spicy tuna on top, and it's drizzled in eel sauce. It is just so so good. \n\nThe spicy California roll is the freshest tasting sushi roll I've ever had, and the spicy sauce on top is out of this world.\n\nThe seaweed salad is also the freshest-tasting seaweed salad I have had, and it is not completely drenched in sesame oil as some can be.  I got a rather large portion of it (about the portion of a standard side salad). \n\nThe Shogun Chicken meal comes with clear soup AND a side salad with awesome ginger dressing, with a side of white rice as well. The chicken is supposed to mimic general tso's chicken; it was a bit different and not as spicy, but delicious nonetheless and a very large portion size. I decided to upcharge my rice to fried rice, whose portion is also a bit larger, and I ate the entire dish of rice, forgetting about the chicken entirely. Whoops. :)\n\nDon't write this restaurant off just because it's in a shopping mall. The decor is beautiful, the happy hour is great, the employees are very friendly and very much on top of things, and the price is not bad for how much food and freshness you get in your meal. Also, no need to visit the hibachi; I think it's a bit weird unless it's a special occasion, as all items are available in the dining room and taste just as hot and fresh off the flat-top.
