Char Kitchen and Bar recently opened and serves American Food laced with touches of the Mediterranean and Europe. The atmosphere is sort of Modern Farmhouse style with comfortable booths and also tables.\n\nWe started with the Chicken Lollis (3@$9.00). They quite small but were cooked just so and were delicious. The Chicken was covered with a Pomegranate, Harrisa BBQ sauce with Feta Cheese and Pickled Onions. The Harrisa was barely used so I didn't taste it but still the Lollis were very tasty.\n\nFor my meal I had the small Santorini Salad with added Chicken. All the vegetables were nice and fresh. The Pink Goddess Dressing was unusual but tasty and the white meat chicken breast was very good with a nice CHAR on it. I thought it was generous in size considering that I ordered a small size salad. ($7+$5)\n\nMy husband had the Choban Lamb Burger ($13.). They prepared it just how he asked and he said it was a very delicious burger with what he thought was a Greek kind of seasoning and a yummy CHARred tomato Chutney. The side order were fingerling potatoes that had creamy interiors and were seasoned with fried herbs.\n\nAll the food we tried was delicious and service was really great too! It was our servers first day and she already knew the menu well enough to answer any question we had.\n\nThis is a nice restaurant that I will go back to.
