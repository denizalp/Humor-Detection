I was in a hurry, but I still managed to pull off a meal here in just over half an hour.\n\nMy friends and I wanted to meet up for lunch, and they picked Pho Annie in spite of having just come from Southern California, which is one of the great centers of Vietnamese cuisine in this world. Another friend had previously told me to try it, so I agreed. It's a nice, traditionally decorated shop on a relatively remote stretch of Rainbow Blvd. It has comfy, clean seats and tables.\n\nDue to tight scheduling, we didn't really share lunch. I had to head to work soon, and they were running into all kinds of traffic and construction. Oh well. I ordered early when the server kindly asked me whether I wanted to order food. I had the pho dac biet ($8.25), my standard order these days.\n\nI definitely enjoyed the broth (better without lime, after experimenting), the noodles were fine, the lime and Thai basil were fresh and tasty, and most of the meats were great. I only had a bit of a faux pas with the \"tai\" meat, the one that's served raw and cooked in the broth). It was bland before it fully absorbed the broth's flavor. Also, the portion size seemed a little bit on the small side. I might have been especially hungry, which could have biased me a bit, but I generally like to have large bowls of pho.\n\nOverall, it was a good meal that I wouldn't be against having again in the future. I won't go out of my way just for this, but it'll certainly be an option if I'm in the area.
