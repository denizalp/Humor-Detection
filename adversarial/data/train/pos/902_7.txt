COVER:\nafter it being $100 a head at XS, we rolled here. home girl of mine hooked it up FOR THE FREE for our entire 10+ entourage..\nI know Surrender is dope and it's in las vegas.. but shit, Marquee is only ranked #84 on the top 100 best clubs list and not only is it brand, spanking new but its THREE STORIES...\n\nMUSIC:\nCALVIN HARRIS was spinning that night, kid has BARS on the turn tables and was absolutely SLAYING our ears!\n\nAMBIANCE:\n-1 star, its entirely outside, no air conditioning and it gets pretty hot in LV... no fans? no girls swinging palm tree leaves to cool down the high rollers? the majority of the middle is the pool area and it takes up a huge amount of space and walking around it is such a buzz kill!\n\nCROWD:\nsome dumbass drunk hoe tossed a drink on me and some of my crew, mid calvin harris set.. for no reason at all.. as shes trying to run, homegirl of MINE yanks the shit out of her hair. as we're all cussing her out her friends pull her away. hoe comes back AGAIN and tries to start shit, so homie of mine gives her a healthy facepalm straight to the middle of her forehead.. no, FIVEHEAD! I was going to subtract a star since security didn't bounce her out ASAP especially since everyone in the area witnessed it and was telling her to GTFO cause bitch was CRAZY.. but they were too dumb to find my homegirl and bounce her out for slapping back so I guess its all G? whatever, we didn't see her after that so she can kiss my fat ass! :D\n\nMORAL:\nthough I didn't pay, i'd only go back again if I got in for free, or it was an absolute last resort. they covered the middle of the pool to create a dancefloor but it was tiny. who's gonna swim that late? just cover the whole thing and make a bigger dancefloor! I accidentally stepped into the pool towards the end of the night and half of my leg was soaked haha!\n\nnext time, get ready early, find the hook ups and hit MARQUEE or XS!\n\nall in all, encore and wynn are nice as hell and you can't go wrong.. but if you want the best and will never settle for less.. don't surrender to Surrender!
