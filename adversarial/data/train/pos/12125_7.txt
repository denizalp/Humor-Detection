I have to agree with a previous review written by Rocco, the staff is rude and they think that being jerks is the way proper customer service should be provided.....ahhhhh wrong! \n\nI have taken my son to Bouncy World twice. The first time it was a very pleasant experience and the staff was very friendly. My son had a blast running all over the place. When we were leaving  I was approached by a man whom I believe is the owner and he asked how everything was and if my son had a nice time, I  told him I would definitely be back again. \n\nSo here is where everything goes down hill, I took my son for the second time. When we walked in the guy at the front, I like to call him Slick, the type the person who thinks that gainful employment is for the peasants and he is just too cool to be working! So slick asked me how old my son was and I said 19 months, so slick decides to roll his eyes at me and say \" God I wish parent would stop telling me the age of their kids in months, I hate it, and I suppose to guess how old he is, so how old is he?\" Ok, slick sorry that basic math stumps you, but there is no need for the attitude. I politely smiled and told him wait until your parent and told him my son is not 2 years old yet. \n\nSeriously, you hate when parents tell you their children's ages in months, but yet you work at place that is for kids? In addition the other staff members are on their phones, try asking them a question and you get attitude back in your face. \n\n\nI really hope that the owner realizes what a detriment his staff is to his business and perhaps he should hire people who actually like children, who want to work and are courteous. Make these changes I will be back again, for now I'm sticking to Kangamoo!
