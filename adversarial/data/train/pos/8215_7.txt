It's no stunning revelation newspapers in it's physical form are in troubled waters. Technology, namely Kindles and the instantly updated internet have been the major reason. I've been a long time print media supporter though and would hate to see our local paper cease to exist or even transform into an online only source. \n\nReading the PD has become an important part of life. A local newspaper unites us with the community, provides us with a days worth of entertainment, news & opinionated columns written by seasoned professionals. And I truly think Cleveland's version does it better than most cities. \n\nWhen I moved into my first house, the very first thing I did before anything else was call The Plain Dealer and set up a subscription to deliver the newspaper every morning to my home. I wanted to be able to wake up that first morning in my new house and walk outside to pick the morning paper out of my driveway. \n\nMaybe there's something nostalgic about the newspaper, spreading it out like an ancient war map and reading it over a cup of coffee in the morning. Call me old fashioned, but staring blankly at a 12\" LCD monitor just doesn't replicate the actual process of reading a physical newspaper. Needless to say, if this routine ever ended, I'd be completely lost.\n\nLong live the newspaper!
