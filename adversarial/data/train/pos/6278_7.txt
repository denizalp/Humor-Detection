Authentic Home Style Cooking from El Salvador with a great tasting selection of delicious items to choose from their fantastic menu. Seafood, Meats, Appetizers, Salads, Pupusas and Traditional Entrees as well as Tasty Desserts. They even provide pictures that you can see of each of the dishes on the menu. Nice!\n\nInside is clean and tidy with fun items on the walls that give you the sensation of being in a little tucked away place in El Salvador. The service was very friendly and helpful when I arrived and when it was time to order. I saw some photos on Brother Yelp and showed a few to her and said I want this one and one of your famous Pupusas to test out.\n\nOrdered the Churrasco Salvadoreño plate which is Steak, Shrimp, Sausage, Black Beans and Rice, Queso Fresco, Fried Plantain, handmade Tortillas and then some. Had to get a Pupusa and asked her what she recommend. She happily replied Pork, Beans and a Cheese or Revueltas con Chicharrón,Queso y Frijoles as shown on the menu. It comes with a delicious side of spicy cabbage and a very tasty red sauce that you put on top for some extra kick. Hotter sauce also available on the table if you are crazy like me.\n\nEverything was packed with flavors and super good. This is not your typical Mexican style food. You must check it out to experience it. In the same complex as Family Dollar store in the deep corner. Yummo!\n\n4.5 STARS
