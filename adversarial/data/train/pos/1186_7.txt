So, me and 7 friends were driving down this road and our van ran out of gas. Which was very frustrating. And I'm like \"hey guys, there's a cabin up ahead.\" \nSo we go in looking for gas, and the friggin door locks behind us. So we're all like f@#$!!!\nSuddenly this ghostly little girl appears and tells us that if we don't get out in an hour we are gonna die!!!\nWhat kind of crap is that!!!\nEverything in this damn cabin is locked. JESUS, IT'S NOT THE BEST NEIGHBORHOOD BUT YOU DON'T HAVE TO LOCK EVERYTHING! That's not very helpful scary little girl! So we start looking for clues to get out. We make it out of one room and there's a damn torture chamber in the next room. Wtf is this all about! We find some keys, find more clues, find more of things that make no sense... and in 56 minutes we find a gas can and make it out alive. We all assumed Jeremy would die, because he's black. Carol would have gone next, but she kept her shirt on. We all lived, somehow. I kinda wanted to kill kevin myself, but that'd make me \"the bad guy\", and i don't need another bad review on my work record.
