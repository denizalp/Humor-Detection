I have never seen more useless customer service people in my life. If you work at an electronics store dont you think you ought to know the difference between a phone and a tablet? Or where the hdmi cables are?\n\nAlso i had no less than FOUR salesmen NOT help me, then try to write up my ticket so theyd get their commission. If even ONE of them had helped me Idve been glad to give them a commission.  But no one did. Guess what? I left the \"write up sheet\" in an aisle somewhere. Note to salesmen: dont be pushy or youll get no commission AT ALL. \n\nWhat REALLY set me off was the cashier who told me Id get a rebate but then didnt bother to tell me i needed a rebate slip, which you need to print out AT THE STORE, WITH YOUR RECEIPT. so if i hadnt noticed this on my rebate receipt, I'd've been SOL. What a scam! \n\nIt'll be a cold day in hell before i go back to this store. Really. \n\nGet your act together people!
