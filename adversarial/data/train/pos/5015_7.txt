I'll start out by saying I hate country music, I was very sceptical when my wife drug me to this.  But it was very entertaining.\n   The guy is funny as hell, a good voice and good guitar player. And when I read on yelp that it's just him and his guitar, I thought it would suck, but it was the perfect fit.\n    Not a lot of people could entertain a crowd that good for nearly 2 1\/2 hours (!)\n    Subtract one star because he bashed some of the music I grew up on.
