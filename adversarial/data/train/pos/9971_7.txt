Had always seen this place when I'm at Stacks and Yolks so I was more than eager to try it. \n\nHonestly, it was really just like any other terriyaki\/hawaiin\/japanese fast food restaurant. The food wasn't bad don't get me wrong but nothing really stood out about it. The price however did, its actually a little bit pricey for what it is. \n\nSo there really is only 3 options on the menu but the concept of picking your own protein and side adds a little fun to the process. What I liked however was their \"sauce bar\". They had quite a few different sauces to pick from to add to your meats. My favorite the wasabi sauce, DELICIOUS! The sauce bar definitely made the experience different and worth the trip.
