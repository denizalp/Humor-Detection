I liked this place even before I ate my turkey burger because:\n\n1. Their menu items use organic, locally-sourced ingredients and are catered to omnivores, vegetarians, vegans, and even gluten-free folks. \n2. Large paintings hang on the interior walls, but there is also an alien theme here--the tip jar is decorated with a green alien face and the chalkboard sign outside reads \"Aliens Eat For Free.\" That's pretty funny. \n\nThere's a juice bar and take-out \"counter\" up front and plenty of tables and seats. For a 1:30pm lunch, there were a good number of empty seats. \n\nThe turkey burger was something else. I've had my share of flavorful turkey burgers, but they've often been flavorful because of a sauce; this turkey burger actually had herbs and seasonings packed into the thick patty. It came with a side of ketchup, but it was unnecessary. The soft brioche buns soaked up the juices of the patty well.\n\nMy friends also enjoyed their salmon burgers and flank steak sandwiches.\n\n\nLikelihood of another visit:\nI'm definitely coming back here again. I've actually heard good things about the gluten-free stuff here! Their No Noodle Lasagna with tofu ricotta and their Beef Ragu Pasta Bowl with gluten-free brown rice penne both sound great.
