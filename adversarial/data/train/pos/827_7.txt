Wood fired pizza cooked to perfection. \nThin crust, not burnt but caramelized brown, crunchy and flavorful. \nYour taste buds will delight, having their own little food orgy of sorts with the personal white with garlic. \nThe house pinot noir is above average too. \n\nNow let's talk about why I rarely visit. \nDC Ranch seems to be littered with these really obnoxious creatures some people like to call 'children'. \nThey're everywhere and it's enough to make you re-think your dreams of ever having a family. \n\nTry to have a nice conversation with your wife as some out-of-control bugger circles your table, looking up at the both of you with both arms raised as if he's some kind of tribal chief leading an attack on you both. This as his mom and dad seated at the next table look on with loving adoration. \nI suppose they're looking to see our reaction....validating their kid's cute factor or something. I hate that.\n\nListen up DC Ranch thirty something's with 'children';\n     \n              YOUR KID ISN'T CUTE. HE'S ALARMING. \n\nBecause after my third glass of wine and without notice, I go to scoot my chair back to make a restroom visit and knock Chief Circling Diapers to the floor while his parents, the people who only a moment ago held a look of  loving adoration, now hold a look of contemptuous hatred.\nLike it was my fault, right?\nWhy couldn't you have simply left him strapped to his high-chair and ignored him like every other parent in there? \nNo, you have to turn him loose so everyone can see his spastic, just-learned-to-walk dance moves. \n\nMaybe the kid will learn something from this. \nMaybe you'll learn something from this.\n\nLike how your kid is cute and all, but  how turning him loose on the other diners for a few \"Oh..look how cute\" compliments is going to send him down for the count faster than Mike Tyson in a Xanax funk.\n\nOrder out next time, please?\nArghhhh.
