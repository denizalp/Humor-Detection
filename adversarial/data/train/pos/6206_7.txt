Got ice cream with wife, dog, and yelper @#!! No pistachio, boo. But the coffee flavor ice cream was good. They even gave us free vanilla cup for pooch. They need some outdoor seating. Otherwise, glad this is right in my hood. Not much going on on this block. Except weirdo people watching. Wife had Superman ice cream, her fave. Why is there no Daredevil cherry or Aquaman kelp flavor? Just wondering.
