Coffee shop thoughts from a non coffee drinker:\n\nFirst things first, check the menu for all non-coffee drinks....no ice tea but they have hot chocolate hmmmm...maple latte, maybe that'll be sweet enough to balance out the coffee taste..... goes with maple latte.\n\n*takes first sip* where the maple at tho. This just tastes like a latte, albeit it does go down smoothy for someone who doesn't like coffee.... acceptable but still would've liked the maple taste.\n\nThe cafe is quite small, lots of people on laptops working. I wait for a table to open up and sit down. Success, a plug right next to me. \n\nBut then... the horror. NO WIFI. *sighs* \nInner struggle: To stay or not to stay.\n\nAll jokes aside; I know it is quite possible to get work done without wifi, it's actually better for concentration but sometimes I need to google stuff and if there's no wifi.... I flounder. Typical millennial behaviour to be quite honest. I fully own up to it. \n\nI was meeting someone for coffee so I didn't really need wifi anyways but I was planning on staying longer after my meeting to study and write a paper.\n\nBut aside from that it's a cute cafe, I managed to finish the latte (an accomplishment), I had a good chat and the seating was quite comfortable. \n\nIt is very small though so don't expect to walk in and get a table right away. Also it gets quite drafty inside so if you're looking for the perfect winter cozy cafe experience TM, not the best of the best.\n\nBut big props to them for having the most convenient plug locations. Truly excellent placement. I changed places twice waiting for a table and both places had plugs.
