Once a year is in Vegas locals and tourists alike can get there gear and extra goodies for all our raves and odd concert venues will attend. I am glad to see this store again, since the glasses that I use at the club broke and I cannot see in rainbow swirls when on the dance floor. Until now! \n\nYes, I ended up finding Hello Kitty rave glasses, and a couple extra in purple and solid black just as a backup. The staff here where the neon green shirts and are so helpful with any questions. The music in the store is awesome since it is so high energy anyways. The people in the store break out into random dancing which can be spontaneous so if you feel like joining in it is encouraged.
