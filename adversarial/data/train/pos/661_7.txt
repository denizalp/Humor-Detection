I want to give Djanel spa a 3.5 star rating however Yelp doesn't allow half stars, I'm rounding down due to the randomness of the place.\n\nI purchased the groupon for a 50 minute Swedish Massage, the massage was great. Djanel is a pro and knows what he's doing, it's just everything else around the experience that left me unsure if I'll return any time soon.\n\nFirst off Spa is an overstatement, it's technically a room in the timeshare, they took the bed and furnishing out and replaced it with 3 massage tables. The room is very relaxing, but it's almost like a semi private hospital room (they even have the track curtains). \n\nWhen I booked my appointment he told me to wait in the lobby and he'd come get me. I waited patiently in the lobby, a few minutes late (nothing too bad) Djanel came down and met me. He then had me follow him up to the \"spa\". On the way to the treatment room we swung through the pool area so he could grab a few towels and he pointed out the pool\/hot tub that I could use if I wanted (nothing fancy but a nice added bonus).\n\nWe then walked to the treatment room, as I said before it's pretty much an empty hotel room with massage tables where the beds should be. He pointed a few things out and then left so I could undress and hop on the table.\n\nThe massage itself was really good, he obviously knows what he's doing, after the massage he offered me a coupon for a discount on my next visit. I'm not much of a massage\/spa guy but if I'm going to book another service I'll probably do it at a bigger place that has all the facilities in house and make a day out of it.\n\nThe services offered were great, Djanel was nice and friendly, but the set up is odd and is probably what will keep me away from future visits.
