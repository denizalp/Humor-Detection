This shopping center is located on Las Vegas Blvd South at Sunset. \n\nPlenty of parking around but it's nice to get a spot on the interior near the stores. You don't have to put money in the parking meters but they may put a fake ticket on ur car. But drop a few in for charity in the one that will take it.\n\nThere a bunch of restaurants, dessert and treats, shopping, people watching and entertainment options. The Rave theatres are nice too.\n\nI go here a lot but it's really hot during summer in the daytime even with the water misters all over. Its really nice at nighttime to walk, shop, hit a few bars and just chill outdoors wit your people.\n\nThere are club bars for nighttime action too. Really nice at night even just to hang out.\n\nRecommended.
