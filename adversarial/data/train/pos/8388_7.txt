So I bought 1 item. After payment went through I remembered I had a coupon. I asked the cashier Susan if I could use it. Susan said \"but it's done already.\" I asked if she could void it. So she voids and asks \"so you don't want it anymore?\" I said that I do but I just wanted to use my coupon. As she is ringing me up again, she tells her coworker next to her \"she's just doing this to get another extra care buck\". I did not even KNOW that another one would print out. She could've waited til I left the store to talk smack about me instead of me standing 2 feet in front of her!
