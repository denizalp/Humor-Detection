Super pissed off that I drive almost 30 miles to get my tax transcripts. They say they're open until 4:30 PM. So I drive and I get here at 4:17 PM and it takes literally three seconds to print off a tax transcript. But the douche bag there said sorry you're not here by 415 so we can't help you. This is after getting patted down for five minutes. Five minutes for the IRS!!! Yes you can get your transcripts online however it wasn't working so I made the trip out here and of course got what I needed from the IRS which is nothing.
