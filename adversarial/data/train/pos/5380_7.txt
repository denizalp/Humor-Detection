This is one of the lowest ratings I've ever given and I would definitely never come back. I gave this place one star because the food was still edible, but the service was mehhh and it made me sick enough to not feel like eating dessert (which almost NEVER happens). \n\nI ordered the fish taco, with a side of caesar salad. The caesar salad was the best thing on the plate. The fish tacos, on the other hand, needed a lot of improvement. There was a strange-tasting bright orange sauce that covered everything in the taco, which made it very hard to avoid while eating. The sauce also soaked into the soft taco and the lettuce. The best word to describe this taco: soggy.\n\nMy friend got the All-Star burger and a strawberry daquiri. She took one sip of it and regretted ordering the $6.99 drink. Her burger looked really sad and after she ate it, she was sad too. Her drink also slowly separated into two distinct layers, which may have been exactly what was happening in her stomach.\n\nI do not recommend this place because it is overpriced and it makes you physically incapable of eating dessert :(
