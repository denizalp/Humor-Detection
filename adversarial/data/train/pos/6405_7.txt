I don't see a single \"negative\" review.  zPizza is the best gluten-free option in the Phoenix metro area!! It's a small family owned business in the heart of Central Phoenix. If you don't live close, come anyway. The food and service is worth the drive! While you're there, try a dessert at the Pink Spot next door. Yummy!
