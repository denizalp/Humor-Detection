Expensive drinks.  Loud.  Themed.  Kinda gross.  \n\nMy real problem with this place is that they do not let you sleep on the floor of the patio, and sometimes when you're in Vegas, that's really all you need.  Not a long nap, but just 3 minutes - power nap.  But no, not at Jimmy Buffet's.  Within seconds there is a team of security around you asking you to take it elsewhere.  \n\nWho wants to go somewhere like that?  Not me.
