If you want to change it up from the Foggy Dew a block away, Old York is a nice alternative. The food is more authentic and tasty anyhow. The burrito and bruschetta are amazing, and my vegetarian ex-girlfriend could always find good options (though the burrito finally came between us).\n\nFrequented by hipsters, knitting clubs, and baseball teams, it can fit more people that you would think.  Go early and get a spot on the patio though, and watch all the pig delivery trucks going into the slaughterhouse across the street (YUM!).  Oh, and you'll probably be killed in the basement where the washrooms are.  But like I said, the burrito is probably worth it.
