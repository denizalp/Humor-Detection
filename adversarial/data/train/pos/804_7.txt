DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY!!!! I hired this company to move my 4 bedroom home and they showed up with a 25 foot truck and what they call a caddy truck, which is about 10 feet..NO WAY WAS THIS GOING TO MOVE MY ENTIRE HOUSE...and i was right..many boxes and items were left behind, furniture scratched, brand new refrigerator dented and scratched..had to rent a U-haul to move the rest of my items...Ive called and spoken with Bernadette,(the owner) and only got excuses and arguements from her. She said she would speak with the movers and review my complaints and call me back. It's been 30 days since that conversation and I've received NO CALL BACK...The worst moving company I've ever come across..SAVE YOUR MONEY, THIS MOVE COST ME OVER $1,600 .....NEXT, BBB
