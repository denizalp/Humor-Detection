Met a friend here for breakfast so I can't tell you anything about the rooms. What I did experience was a friendly check-in clerk and a large roomy parking lot that is right around the corner from the airport.\n\nFor the breakfast, at 8:15 on a weekday it was very well picked over. White bread, gone. Scrambled eggs, gone. Bacon, nearly gone. Sausages, nearly gone. They were probably cooking up more in the back, but what I saw was disappointing.\n\nIt's probably a really nice hotel (my friend said good things about his room) but the breakfast let them down.
