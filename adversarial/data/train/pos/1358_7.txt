It doesn't get much better than this! My husband and I were offered an upgrade to a corner balcony suite on our trip. We were placed in a high room with the most incredible views of Las Vegas! The room itself was comfortable, but it was nothing compared to the balcony itself and those views. Helicopters would provide tours and were flying lower than our room, where we could watch them. \n\nMy love of the Cosmopolitan did not end at the views from the room, it also involved the use of the private spa suites with amazing copper side by side bathtubs, Jose Andres private dining experience at e' (and yes, it is just e'), and the other details such as the chandelier bar with it's amazing crystals, the finds in the luxury vending machines and last but not least the secret pizza place! \n\nI have a few places I adore in this city, but I overall the Cosmopolitan is my number one or at least number two...it's so hard to decide! Check out my photo of the view!
