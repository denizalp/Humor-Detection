LUH me some Cane's whenever I visit my good friends in Gilbert. This location on Val Vista is nice. I wish we had one near where I live in the Los Angeles area. I luh the chicken fingers. I luh the Cane's sauce. I luh the sweet tea. I luh the crinkle cut fries. \n\nWe decided to come here after the Lantern Festival in Queen Creek and were all super hungry. I got the Caniac Combo to share. In fact, we ordered several Caniac Combos to share amongst our group. The Caniac comes with 6 chicken fingers, crinkle cut fries, 2 Cane's sauces, cole slaw, a large drink and a texas toast. The chicken is tasty, the sauce is great, the sweet tea was good, the fries were just ok. Good stuff. Everyone enjoyed the food.\n\nCustomer service especially from the young lady at the register was very nice. Pay at the counter, your name will be called and your tray brought to you. All the staff were super nice. I will for sure be back the next time I'm in town. Cane's!
