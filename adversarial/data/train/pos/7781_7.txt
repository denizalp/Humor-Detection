After a weekend of cleaning, I had some stuff to donate here at the Goodwill.  I had to get rid of a desk in my place, to make room for other stuff, and thought that donating it would be the best thing.\n\nThis particular Goodwill is located in a shopping mall, and is easy to see from the road.  The donation area is located behind the shopping strip, and it states that so you dont actually have to get out of your car and walk inside.\n\nI drove around, and the donation area was quite efficient.  There was a line of cars (I was #4) and there was plenty of people waiting to help you unload your car of stuff.  I waited for my turn, and the nice man unloaded my stuff for me!\n\nAfterwords, I went and cruised the store.  They seem to have regular sales on stuff, and a garden variety of items for sale.   Mens and womens clothing, Lamps, household items, ETC.\n\nI gave them 5 stars becuase A) they serve the community to those who are less fortunate then us.  B) the donation area was efficient C) giving back is important.
