Stellar! And in the heart of Mississauga. This spot is located half a block from the Northwest corner of Hurontario Street and Dundas Street (just north of the Cooksville Colonnade building). As others have said, parking can be found behind the building. \n\nFirst, environment and service. Clean, welcoming, with visible effort to make the place look nice. Very warm, pleasant atmosphere, nice music - everything together made for a great dining experience. Thanks to Sophia, our server, and the restaurant owner who took care of us so attentively from start to finish!\n\nSecond, the food. In short, everything we had was DELICIOUS! Truly exceptional, and there was evidently careful thought put into meal preparation. We ordered: Empanadas, Plantain Chips, Arepas with Chicharron, the Paisita (rice, beans, various meats), and two Colombian fizzy sodas (Postobon). Everything was so, so, so, good - I can't emphasize that enough. Bursts of flavour. Good portions. Reasonable prices. The Chicharron (reminds me of Filipino Lechon) was so crispy. The empanadas were crunchy and stuffed generously. There was nothing we didn't like, and everything was a treat to taste.\n\nThey really make you feel welcome here. They don't make your dining experience a disengaging one - if you're unfamiliar with Colombian food, they talk to you about the menu, they get to know your likes and dislikes and recommend accordingly. \n\nAn absolute gem in the heart of Mississauga and we'll definitely be back. This place is great for group dinners, family dinners, and makes a great date spot too - a restaurant for all ages and occassions. For two people, with tax and tip, our total came to around $47.00.
