Scott Thompson, otherwise known as the famous \"Carrot Top\" puts on a great show. He's full of energy and non-stop miscellany jokes. It may offend others. However it doesn't offend me. I think he's freaking hilarious. Alcohol IS available and so is popcorn. Have an open mind, it's a show for everyone to watch that is over 18. Dress up or dress down, just let loose and have fun.
