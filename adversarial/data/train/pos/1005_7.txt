I have been to this station a few times now, since I have spent some time in this area lately.\nShell is usually good gasoline so I like going there and the price is quite decent.\nThey are clean and I get a receipt at the pump, which I have found lately I have to go into places to get the receipt.\nThey have a car wash which is another plus(I love a clean car).\n\nThe little shop inside has about anything you could want when you are in a hurry, which is also nice.
