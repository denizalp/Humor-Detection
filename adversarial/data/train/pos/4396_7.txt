love love love the clothing.....great prices, fashionable clothing, great styles!  however they have horrible customer service & are completely prejudice! if your not latino they don't like you and are very rude! They only talk to people they believe has money! i walked in ready to spend $300 one day and walked out only spending $60.00 because the girls are such bitches! I would never go back to that store, I'd rather spend my money elsewhere with exceptional customer service!\n\nCourtney\n\np.s. Once I find the corporate manager or owner I'll give them suggestions on some people I know around the Las Vegas area that would absolutely turn that store into a customer orientated store & sales would sky rocket!
