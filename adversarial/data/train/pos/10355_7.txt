I love Yafo Kitchen! When I was an amateur I ordered wraps. THEN I realized if you get a bowl, it comes with that lovely laffa bread on the side and you can make your own wraps out of the contents in the bowl. The bowl also holds a lot more than a wrap will and you can get things that would be funky in wrap form, like beet salad or chickpea salad. Just order the bowl, okay??\n\nThe falafel is fantastic and the real unsung hero is the mushrooms! Get them on your bowl, trust me. I don't know how they're seasoned but they add an awesome flavor to the bowl. \n\nMy favorite bowl:\n1\/2 and 1\/2 bowl with greens and cous cous \nHummus and baba ganouj \nBeet salad \nChickpea salad \nTomato\/cucumber salad \nPickles \nKalamata olives \nSumac onions \nCabbage slaw \nFalafel \nMushrooms \nAnd a side of schug! \n\nI can easily make two meals out of this. \n\nMy only gripe with Yafo is that they were careless with animal products, twice. \nOne time, they were scooping chicken for another customer and dripped the chicken liquid across my wrap. \nA second time, someone had spilled feta into the pickles. When I asked if she could try to avoid the spilled feta and just give me pickles, she replied \"we cannot guarantee our ingredients will be vegan\". I just replied, I get that but as you're scooping can you try to avoid the feta that fell into the pickles? \n\nI'm still giving them 5 stars because the food is so good! But if you are vegan, just watch for the potential cross contamination.
