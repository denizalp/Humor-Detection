Let me provide the setting: \n\nSaturday evening a couple hours before a play....\n\nNow the cast of characters:\n\nThe manager at the door taking names and numbers in party has no business a) talking to patrons b) managing a floor in general. He came across rude to us and to others walking in. He said there was a 15-minute wait for a half-empty restaurant that stayed half empty the entire wait and time we were there. \n\nThe staff, including the manager, we in their Sunday's best....and by \"Sunday's best\" I mean mom jeans and disheveled wrinkled clothing. It's not that jeans offend me, or even a polo or something like that....heck, even a t-shirt. It's just like people were taken to the local GoodWill, given 55 cents, and 2 minutes to not only choose and purchase their uniform for the evening, but also put it on. \n\nSeriously, I'm not a dick, but the guy even managing had that 80's I'm at the bar wearing my British Knights and have a pink comb in my way-too-tight back pocket thing going on. \n\n\nJust weird.\n\nAnyhow, the waitress was friendly enough.....but they are slow....very slow. We weren't the only ones complaining. It wasn't a matter, seemingly, of her not caring but just no one knew what was going on.....very very very bad management and training. Food was just OK and the price should be a little smidge lower for the quality of food....let alone lack of good service.
