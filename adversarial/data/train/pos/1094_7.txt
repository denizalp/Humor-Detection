This place already has a plethora of reviews so mine really isn't needed but since I'm a hot dog fan I had to say something. The Chicago dog was amazing as expected, all the fixings on a steamed bun! The fries were underwhelming and needed more seasoning. The Chili Cheese Tamale was surprisingly good but you feel guilty with each bite ( I swear that thing has to be a million calories alone and only God knows what they are using as the filler!). The stand out thing here for me is the service. This place has excellent customer service, from the time you walk in till the time you walk out their employees make you feel at home and that's something I really cherish. In this day in age when most establishments are only concerned about your money, Portillo's goes the extra mile to make your overall experience great.
