Hotel rooms were super nice, But they took all of my money and I couldn't get over the fact they didn't have any Redbull!\n\nVery nice place, I'm happy I can now say I've been there. But I have experienced better.\n\nBar:\nFresh off a flight from Detroit I arrive at the HRH around midnight. I'm greeted with a drink (Vodka & Monster) and plenty of handshakes from  a large group of fellow co-workers and friends. The drink was horrible, thinking maybe somebody was being cute and tainted my drink with a complimentary Vegas party favor I ordered another. Tasted equally as shitty. that was last drink I paid for there. \n\nHOTEL:\nThe room was awesome, great view from the Casino Tower facing North. You could see the pools below, and the northern end of the strip. Beverages that came in the fridge were a little over priced... but thats Vegas for ya.\n\nCASINO:\nEvery dollar I won on the strip I lost here at Hard Rock. I've never seen dealers pull the hands they were pulling. Nice big spread out floor, managed well. During the week it was down to only a few open tables. The weekend is when the place was rocking though! every table filled, mass groups of people checking in, checking out, coming and going from the concerts, and the line outside the club in there was crazy. \n\nPOOL: We all went to the Paradise Beach North pool. Took a while for us to get organized in finding what we wanted. Place was busy and all of the good cabanas were taken (before 11am). Cabanas were expensive and the only ones available were away from the pool (away from the action). We finally found what was an oversized ottoman we rented for $500+ for the day. Drinks (Vodka & Monster) were around $36 a piece. The pool was frigid, but entertaining. Some of the most beautiful women in the world sun bathing. But there were some of the world's \"people that shouldn't be in a bikini\" there as well. All together we blew thousands there in drinks and from renting the ottoman\/ couch.\n\nBottomline: Bring a thick wallet and plenty of  KY
