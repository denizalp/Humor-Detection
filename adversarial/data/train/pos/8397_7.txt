We have been to Ferris many times and it had been good. Tonight was a disaster. We took our 13 year old son out for a good steak. The service was slow as people who sat before us were served ahead of us. Our steaks had to be sent back twice as we watched my wife go on and enjoy her meal.  We had to wait for over an hour for our meals. When I asked to be comped for our two meals, the owner would only comp us off one dinner saying that we \"ate the steak\". He was not very accommodating. My son got a real lesson in how not to run a business. Needles to say, we will never be back.
