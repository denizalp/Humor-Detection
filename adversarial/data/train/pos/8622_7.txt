Everything that James W said...seriously. Great place to go if you are looking for an alternative to the chain coffee places you find everywhere. NJC does not have comfy seats, board games, multiple people working behind the bar or any kind of corporate feel. This is a place you go to when you want a coffee that is not only tasty and strong but also art. It's a wonderful yet different feeling of being able to chat it up with the person making your drink. See something on the walls that you dig? Pretty much all the art work is for sale. Go support your local business and find out that it's not just about coffee.\n\nPS-Get whipped cream on your drink, it's laced with magical crack. Ok, not really, but it is damn good.
