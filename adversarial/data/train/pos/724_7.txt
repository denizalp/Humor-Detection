so continuing on from previous post.....\n\nAnyways after arguing with them i have a friend fax over a copy of a non- see through card and FILL OUT a freaking AUTHORIZATION form since it was her name not mine. So whatever a hassle but its over...now onto enjoying the WYNN.......\n\n\nwe put our\" maid service please\" sign up in the morning and when we return at 9pm......still messy. we call down and they apologize- we tell them to just forget it and bring towels. \n\nthe next day we go to get our car from valet (which has been sitting there for 2 nights now) get in drive out of the driveway onto the street- when it feels like ive all of a sudden lost control. I pull over at a gas station as soon as there is one available and notice a HUGE SCREW in my tire. WTF?!??!?! after allllll this and now a screw in my tire???\n\ni call the hotel immediatly to let them know what happened. They want me to drive back and make a claim - they want ME to PAY for it and then they would \"possibly\" reimburse me after they investigated. No freaking way! \n\nif i had done that to my tire it would have been totally or at least partially flat 2 1\/2 days later. I asked for a manager.....\n\n\nhe told me the same story. I explained to him this whooooole situation over the whole course of our stay and he tells me well you can get it fixed and we will figure it all out when you get here. UM excuse me??!? how unprofessional is that?!?!?\n\nwe happen to be at a gas station thats also a shop so they fix it no pob for $20. I go back storm up to the front desk ask for the person i spoke with on the phone and hand them my reciept.\n\nokay miss we will give you $20 credit as a courtesy to your room. NO! i tell them you will effing not you will give me $20 cash right now \n\n\n3 managers later i tell them look- im not tying to swindle you there is the reciept its $20 not $1000 wtf is the problem? they finally just give me the $20 to shut me up.\n\nwe had put the \"do not service\" sign up this time and when we get to our room........its clean. \n\n\n and let me just mention that when they went for another mngr i took a peek at the screen \n\n\nthat \"upgrade\" we got for our troubles- yea it clearly stated upgrade due to overbooking.\n\nniiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiice. oh and did i mention that after booking a smoking room over the phone and confirming it at check in our \"upgrade\" was a non-smoking floor.\n\n\noh and btw everytime i was up there complaining - so was someone else. It seems like i am not the only person in the world who has had so many problems with this place!\n\n\nIDIOTS!\n\n\ni would except the best staff at a place this highly reccomended and this expensive but no. \n\n\ni told them straight out i felt like they were not helping me at all because \n1- it was a comped stay\nand\n2- because i am 23 and not some 50yr old buisness man\n\n\n\ni will NEVER EVER recommend this place to anyone anytime.
