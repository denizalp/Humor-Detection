A damned fine slice of NY Pizza, with a pretty decent list of toppings. Got delivery from here today- it was prompt, the pizza was tasty, the price was right, and it's good for what it's good for. NY Pizza isn't my favorite, but that won't stop me from giving this place a solid rating. They do what they do, and they're doing it well. I give them props for that.
