I have been going to Yama for a long time...recent visits have me concerned. While the food quality is still good, the service leaves MUCH to be desired.  My husband and one of our daughters went here this past Saturday evening.  Wait time was 20 minutes- much better than other restaurants we called.  As promised we were seated within that time frame.  Only problem was that we waited 1.5 hours for our food! And parts of it were missing.  The waitress was sweet and apologized several times. However, she then started avoiding us b\/c I suppose she knew there was nothing she could do.  When we finally ate and received our check, she and the hostess apologized and said they took a couple things off the bill (the two cheapest items- edamame and one of our salads).  That would have been a nice gesture if we had received those items to begin with!  Done with this place until I consistently hear things have improved.
