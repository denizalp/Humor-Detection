Finding a good drycleaner is like finding a good man...JUST KIDDING. It's actually like WAAAAAY more important than that! All it takes is one time and one expensive designer silk dress that's carelessly ruined for you to be terrified to ever go to a drycleaner ever again. \n\nFear not! This place is great! Very quick, nice staff, inexpensive, and I've never had an issue with a garment here. Plus, your clothes don't come back with that weird \"drycleaner smell\" which is nice and they put these none slip foamy thingys on all of their wire hangers so nothing slips off. Aww how thoughtful! I mean, there's nothing more swear-word inducing then a freshly laundered drycleaned item falling onto the pavement due to slipping off it's hanger. \n\nMy only ONLY bone to pick is it's such a bummer that they are closed on Sundays. It's inevitable really on Sunday I will a.) Crave Chick Fil'a something fierce and b.)need something drycleaned. Sigh*
