I am a Pittsburgh native who comes to Primanti's *maybe* once a year when I'm doing my holiday shopping in the Strip. It's always about 90% tourists when I'm in there, and I'm unsurprised to see that the reviews are also mainly touristy types. I think many people have a fundamental misunderstanding of what a Primanti's sandwich actually *is.* Their cheesesteak is not at all like a Philly cheesesteak (God forbid!) and the meat in general is weirdly ersatz, with some selections usually not seen in a modern restaurant setting (knockwurst? whatever the burger patty on the cheesesteak is made from?) Primanti's originated as working-class trucker's food, designed to be held in one hand while driving (hence the purpose of having the fries INSIDE the sandwich and the 'round-the-clock hours). So yeah, there's something a little gimmicky and pass√© about it now, particularly when they have a location in Florida and everyone and their mumma is making a \"Pittsburgh style!\" sandwich. But it does have its origins in the Rust Belt, slap-it-together-and-make-it-work culture that makes Pittsburgh unique. IMO it's worth it just to stop in and experience, if only for the 15 minutes it takes for them to make your sandwich and you to eat it, some truly vintage P-burgh culture.\n\nSo how is that mystery meat on the sandwich, in this townie's opinion? Well...it's pretty good. I actually like those weird burger patties and sometimes crave them when I'm not at home. The sweet sausage and kielbasa sandwiches are also pretty excellent. Don't drink an Iron City (it's disgusting for real) and have a Yuengling instead. Have a boilermaker if you're feeling especially touristy and ready to get drunk. Then stumble out into the Strip and enjoy your uniquely Pittsburgh experience.
