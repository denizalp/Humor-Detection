I'm pretty sure that Fukuburger has replaced dirty street tacos as my favorite post-libation-snack-while-you-sober-up option.\n\nFriday and Saturday nights they can often be found in a parking lot off of 6th and Fremont these days...and I completely support this decision. \n\nMy standard these days is the #2 Tamago and their Jazz fries!  They do a great job with their burgers here...always cooked to a wonderful med-rare every time.  They have a couple house-made sauces that are spot on for burgers.  I would be confident ordering any of their items though.
