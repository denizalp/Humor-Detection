ER Nurse: \"So what happened\"?\n#1 Son:   \"Dad took a header\".\n\nWhat actually happened was we went on a hike and #1 son tripped. Dad (that would be me) was following too closely, tripped over #1 son and dislocated two toes, broke one of them and got some nasty trail-rash on his left forearm. #1 son - a small scratch on his hand.  \n\nUnfortunately I came to the ER around the same time as a number of other people who were much worse off than I was.  While I didn't like waiting I was also happy that my injuries didn't warrant a higher place in line.  Everyone from the woman who checked me in, the admitting nurse, the ER nurses, the medical assistant, the xray tech, the PA who made my toes straight again and the doctor who popped in to say hi were very professional, caring and friendly.  They even went out of their way to amuse my two sons who were bored beyond tears.\n\nNot a good day but if it had to end in an ER, I'm glad it was this one.
