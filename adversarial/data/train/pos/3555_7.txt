I met a friend for a cold brew and opted to bypass Starbucks to try something more original. I just had a huge lunch which I regretted when I saw the ice cream selections.\n\nJust OK because the cold brew was more cream than coffee. I had to have them remake it so I could actually taste coffee. \n\nI'll go back and try the ice cream and update this review.
