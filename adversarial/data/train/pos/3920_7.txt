I have discriminating tastes when it comes to Italian food and despite the less than favorable reviews listed here, I decided to try it. It was relatively quiet and intimate and has a unique style about itself (hence \"Garden\" in the name).\n\nI found the pasta to be cooked very well. However, the meat sauce was a bit runny. If they had less water in it, it would be perfect. The time it took for the food to be served was good - not rushed and not unnecessarily delayed. \n\nThe waiter service was great. Again, not being super-busy, this is expected. They delivered and I was very happy with it. \n\nThe critique about interior d√©cor is a hyperboles at best. Simply, the floral patterns on the booths are a bit dated, but this has no bearing on the dining experience. By the description of the reviews from others, I was expecting to walk into sea-green and puke-yellow color. It was nothing of the sort and I found the interior calming and quiet - the way an Italian restaurant should be. \n\nWhile I'm still exploring about additional sit-down Italian restaurants across Tempe, I will keep this on my short list of places to hit. \n\nOh yeah, friends don't let friends go to Olive Garden or Sbarros. Shop local! ;-)
