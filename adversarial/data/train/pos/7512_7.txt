Aloha Specialties makes some of the best Hawaiian type food outside of Hawaii.  It could be because most of the customers come from Hawaii so they want to make it as authentic as possible.\n\nFirst off, when you go here, order the Korean Chicken.  It's a bit spicy but if you like the heat like I do then \"you will love this.\". The more people the merrier...so you can try some of your friends dishes as well, like their Local Plate that comes with Spam Musubi.  What is Spam Musubi?  Well, it's spam sushi-style.\n\nIt's CASH ONLY here so bring some greenbacks with you.  It's located inside the California Hotel & Casino.  Parking is free for 4 hours after validation near the cashier cage.  Aloha Specialties is a great place to try out some Hawaiian cuisine if you've never had it before.  Enjoy!!!
