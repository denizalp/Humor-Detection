I am a religious Raku go-er so there aren't many places that will impress me. Yonaka was pretty good, foodwise and ambiance wise, service wise was lacking and slow a bit but I won't hold it against them. \n\nFusion japanese food at its finest I guess you could call it. Ordered a variety of dishes ranging from hamachi kama to fried brussel sprouts. It was very tasty, but I found that things were on the more well-cooked side, personally I like things cooked just right or on the raw side a bit. Sushi was ok, the nigiri was well-thought out and different but they didn't taste as good as they sounded. \n\nWe came with a few out of town friends and they really liked it, it was a good meal. I wouldn't be jumping with joy to come back here, but maybe I'll give them another chance to impress me more.
