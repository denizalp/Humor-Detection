This bar is a great down to earth place to stop and have a drink.  Most people are blue collar regulars and are friendly and welcoming.  The crowd is mixed and features all colors, sexual orientations, and incomes.  Everyone blends together very pleasantly.  This is a shot and a beer joint.  Don't come here expecting to order a pink squirrel and sashay around a dance floor.  It's bare bones decor, but nicely decorated around holidays.  The neighborhood is a bit seedy but use some common sense and carry a sidearm and you'll be fine.  Prices are very reasonable.  Drinks are strong.  It's a gay bar but you wouldn't know it when you walk in.  It looks like any other bar in Cleveland.  The difference is the people, they're down to earth and friendly.  If you're a snob and have the habit of looking down your nose at everyone else, you might want to try twist, as this is not a fashion or model event, although sometimes a young fashionista scarf model may prance into the hawk.
