I called in and asked the guy who answered to look and see if he had any \"Lord of the Unreal\" in stock. He told me it wasnt worth his time to be bothered to look up 4 $2 cards, and that if I wanted to see if they where in stock I had to drive in and look them up myself.\n\nI didnt bother with a store whos customer service was so terrible, and instead went to Henderson to Action Comics. (I spent $200 there that day.) Not only was the place 5 times the size of Little Shop, the owner and his wife go out of their way to get you whatever you need, even if they have to order it.\n\nAction Comics has triple the card playing space, and triple the card playing player base.\n\nIll never step one foot inside Little Shop or spend even a penny of my gaming dollar on those jerks, true story.\n\nBig Villain
