O's bastard cousin.  Impressive and intricate circular staging and choreography with the water.  Visually affecting and interesting but less impressed by the acrobatics\/athleticism (been there, seen that).  Plus, too disturbed by the tall man with exposed female boobies parading around and all the bald men flying around in long red skorts.  Maybe I was too distracted, but what plot?
