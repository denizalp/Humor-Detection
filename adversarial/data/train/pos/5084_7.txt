Voodoo is one of my favorite breweries, I've even made the happy pilgrimage out to sleepy Meadville to enjoy their ambrosia straight from the source.\n\nImagine my delight upon discovering that they were opening a new brewery right in my backyard in Homestead.  It's nearly within stumbling distance of my house, and offers a huge number of award winning craft beers and barrel aged heavy hitters.\n\nTheir decor has a ton of character including wooden shipping palette tables, intricate chalk art on the ceilings ranging from portraits of Nicola Tesla to Sistine Chapel recreations, and massive graffiti pieces covering the loading docks.  Their eclectic mix of art styles is as diverse and inspired as their beer.  \n\nVoodoo is a welcome addition to the neighborhood, and while we have many fine breweries in Pittsburgh, none are as uncompromising in quality, as unapologetically zany, or as over flowing with character as Voodoo.
