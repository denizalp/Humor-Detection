It's good but you have to pick the right menu items. Some they execute better than other Thai restaurants and some they don't.\n\nThe interior looks bizarre. Like somebody made a trip to the community garage sale to buy some stuff that might make sense separately but together? Not really. Stage for karaoke + Christmas tree lights + sparkly hearts + license plates on the wall + Home Sweet Home wall decor + Bob Marley. If you think about it, it's genius! You don't have to change decors for certain holidays. Christmas, Valentine's Day, 3-11 Day, etc - they celebrate everything everyday.\n\nThe place was empty when we came here for dinner. We got free egg rolls and a small Thai iced tea for checking in on Yelp. Their spicy scale is from 1-5 and 3 was pretty spicy. My eyeballs and pretty much my entire head were sweating uncontrollably.\n\nTom Yum Soup:\nTom Yum with chicken and mushrooms. A little salty, citrusy, sweet then the spiciness punches your taste buds. It's a little sweeter than what I'm used to. 3\/5\n\nNam Tok Beef:\nSalad with lettuce, roasted rice powder, grilled beef, mint, chili and lime juice. Great flavors: the acidity intensifies the heat from the chili. Spicy level 3 but felt way spicier than that. 4\/5\n\nCombination Pad Thai:\nThis had the same issue as the Tom Yum soup. It's sweeter than what I'm used to. 3\/5\n\nBeef Panang:\nCreamy curry and coconut sauce. They're not too generous with the beef but it was still good. 3\/5\n\nSweet Sticky Rice with Mangoes:\nCute presentation. They look like sushi. The rice is perfectly cooked. Soft and it absorbs the coconut milk. The best version I've had. 5\/5\n\nThai Tea Ice Cream:\nGenerous portion and has sprinkles on top. I hate sprinkles but I love Thai tea ice cream so much. 4\/5\n\nWe also tried the grilled squid and fried rice. Too much food!
