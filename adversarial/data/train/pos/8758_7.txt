Oh god, no more poutine.  I feel so heavy, but I'm really hungry.  Why is everything closed on Sunday?  WHY why?  It's s... s... so cold, can't feel my feet.  Oh!? It's open!  One large bowl with everything on it please.  (eating pause)  Let's go to the top of Mount Royal guys!\n\nA bowl of pho can really lift your mood, even after pounding your body into submission with beer and poutine for three straight days.  It is right on par with almost every other pho restaurant I've been to.  This one just happened to be open on Sunday and in the direction we were walking.  For that, I am a fan.
