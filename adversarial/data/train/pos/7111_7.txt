Ordered 2 lunch specials: chicken gyro with fries and pepperoni pizza. Both cam with drinks. The chicken gyro was packed with chicken, tzaziki sauce, cucumbers, and was very good. How does this place do pizza this well? Yeah, the pizza was good, just the right amount of cheese, pepperoni, crispy crust, a solid pizza in its own merits. The service was excellent! Unfortunately, they ran out of their famous rice pudding. I'll be back to try that!
