Pho Kim Long, Vietnamese with a Chinese menu.\n\nI've been to PKL a thousand times. Nine times out of ten, its 4 am and I'm really drunk. They're 24 hours and one of the few affordable restaurants close to the strip. But seriously though, food is supposed to taste better when your drunk, isn't it?\n\nPHO: Sometimes my soup comes a little greasy. On occasion, noodles are under-cooked and I feel like their beef and other fillings could use some improvement. Also, pho is served with \"rare steak.\" So why is my beef tai 100% cooked when it gets to the table?\n\nCHINESE: I came here a lot with someone who didn't like Vietnamese food. He ordered off the Chinese menu because lets face it, who doesn't like Chinese food? The seafood combination pan-fried noodles and the beef stir fry with broccoli are pretty good. Entrees are usually served with steamed rice. The fried rice here is flavorless and not worth the $8. If you like Mapo Tofu, skip the mapo tofu here, it tastes strange!\n\nAPPETIZERS: Spring rolls are pretty good. But they're raw and  you drench them in peanut sauce--can't mess those up. Egg Rolls taste good but they're unusually small... For the same price, I can get decent size ones down the street at my favorite pho joint. \n\nCREDIT CARD FRAUD: A day or two after one visit, I realized I never got my card back from the server. When numerous fraudulent charges came up, I had to assume a shady server swiped my card. They ordered things online and sent them to a local address. PAY CASH. Can't trust shady asians.\n\nSERVICE: The service sucks. It's god awful and when you really need water, don't expect them to give it to you on their own. Don't be shy, flag someone down and demand what you need.\n\nNothing to rave about but not a bad place to eat when your wasted and in desperate need of food.\n\nDon't forget to RATE & FOLLOW! ;)
