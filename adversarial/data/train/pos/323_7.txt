This is a mom and pop's restaurant. Their food has a very good home taste to it. However, you can tell they lack some business experience. When we arrived the older lady was arguing with the person who was taking our order. I felt a bit awkward and surprised that they were running a business that way.  In regards to the food, the spaghetti was awesome. The meat sauce had a lot of fresh tomatoes which were delicious.  We also had the fried catfish which was crunchy and perfectly cooked. The sides were very average. The coleslaw had very large pieces of cabbage. The mac and cheese looked dry and lacked some flavor.  The prices were reasonable and the overall taste of the food was good. I can see why some reviews are only one star and why some others are four stars. The food is really good, but the customer experience is not that great.
