So let me address the obvious: Aussie Heat is hands down the BEST male revue show in Las Vegas!!! Ready to hear why?!\nFirst, the talent level is just absolutely insane. Seriously! This is the ONLY male revue show that I've ever been to that has guys who are ACTUALLY talented!! I've been to several other male revue shows and they're like robots who don't want to be there. Not these guys! These guys have GREAT personalities and they look so excited to be dancing and having fun! Which brings me to the next point-\nSecond, they're actually SUCH NICE GUYS! No listen, hear me out. I've seen the eyes roll when I tell everyone I know how great the show is that the guys are super sweet. \"It's all an act\" they say- not true!! I've seen the show at LEAST ten times. (Yeah, that's how much I love it) and the host ALWAYS remembers my friend and I BY name, and the other guys get SO excited when we chat. Other male revue shows leave you feeling weird or bothersome when you want to chat after the show. Oh! My next point!\nThird, they come hang out with you after the show! And they actually take the time to talk to you! After seeing them over 10 times and comparing to other male revue shows, it's just obvious that these aren't just regular performers. They're COOL guys with TONS of talent and great personalities! \nOk so what are you waiting for? Go see them! And do yourself a favor and give Adam some love, because he has to be the most awesome genuine guy ever! I love Aussie Heat!
