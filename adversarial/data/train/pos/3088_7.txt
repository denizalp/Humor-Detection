i dont really have loyalties with airlines...esp these days with prices, fees, etc thru the roof. it might *appear* i have it to southwest, but thats really only because they are usually the lowest for the places i go.\n\nwell, us airways won last time around. and since it was a quick weekend trip with a carry-on bag (since every airline BUT southwest now charges to check), why not.\n\nmy thoughts on this airline:\n\n- Apparently I was lucky my flight wasnt massively delayed. It was delayed about 5 minutes and they made up the time. I've heard from mult. sources they have a history of being massively delayed (esp. out of their hub, PHX)\n\n- Though you get assigned seats, the gate area is a chaotic mess. People were crowded in a big herd while lets see.... gold class, silver class, bronze class, cubic zirconia class, tin can class ALL get to go before the plebeian coach ticket holders.\n\nand though i had an assigned seat...my overhead area was full :-| had to put my bag way ahead of my seat.\n\n- The staff is MEAN. they kept yelling at everyone like drill sergeants - \"seat up!\" \"device off!\" \"sit straight!\" \"march march!\" - ok not that last one.\n\n- They only offer Coke, diet coke, coke zero, sprite and diet sprite. HUH? horrible options. i miss my dr pepper of southwest sigh...oh and forget peanuts or pretzels.\n\n...in the end, i got home in one piece and on time. but seriously, where is the incentive to fly here when there are other options? oh yeah, they can be the cheapest flight. \n\nwell, there you go.
