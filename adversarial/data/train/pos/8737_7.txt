So... I was invited to go to a birthday party there w\/ a friend; close as family. All seemed well until I actually got out of my car. The parking lot smelled of raw sewage. Made me sick, but I thought, \"It's Vegas.. It always smells like raw sewage.\", so I moved on. Walked into 'Rendezvous' and the smell was just more concentrated; I had found where the smell was coming from. Now, one could understand the circumstance of the situation, the toilets having problems, grease traps; It happens, but this place looked run down, old, and dirty and the vibe was awful. As I looked for an employee I saw none, so I just went to my assigned seat. My aunt comes up to us to talk arrangements and she is furious w\/ the lack of communication from the staff leading up to the event, so much so she can't even concentrate on the task at hand. We settle down, finish our discussion, and move forward. Keep in mind the smell is so strong at this point it just makes you almost sick. I look around only to see a few girls in black throwing cheap air freshener all over the room, which makes for a wonderful packed-litter-box\/8-different-cheap-smells kind of aroma. -_- Looking for water and I notice that 2 out of 9 tables in the room had water. Had to get my own water. The DJ was AWEFUL, and yet a great photographer?? Our family had cameras. (Keep in mind ZERO service for 3 hours and smelled like *#^&!) Come to find our family is billed gratuity for no service. It was a JOKE!!\n\nThere are countless other cons and disgusts that my family and friends have to say about this place. It was also their experience, so it's not my place to put them all here in this review. All I can say for that place is I hope It gets shut down. It's a waste of space. \n\nUPDATE: Just received this private message from the DJ. Pull yourself together, Rendezvous.\n\nMichael L: \"you suck to we were short of staff and i even let u guys play ur own music too and ur going to say the dj is aweful ur stupid you dont even know whats going on behind the scenes dont come back again pls\"\n\nNeedless to say I gladly won't be back.
