The manager had asked me to give them another try so I did.\n\nI was VERY impressed and VERY happy with the service.\n\nTips\n- Make sure to reserve through their site and enter a coupon for 5% off\n- Try to rush out of the bus and rush to the line.  Getting ahead of 1-2 people may save you 5-10 minutes.\n\nChecking-in\n- A worker is dedicated to making sure the line is in order.  Asking non-drivers to step aside and asking people if they have reservations\n- There were 3 workers checking people in\n- Kimberly was EXTREMELY friendly and speedy\n- They asked for three options\n\"Would you like to upgrade to a ____\"\n\"Would you like full protection or basic protection\" - they are a bit pushy on this.  They'll ask you what your deductible is and they'll try to sell you by using fear.  Just say no.\n\"Would you like the gas fill up service\"\n\nPicking up the car\n- After you check-in, they ask you to go downstairs where you line up once more to get your key and a form to check off anything wrong with the car.\n- Then you have to return to the line to give the signed paperwork acknowledging any damages\n- I reserved a Hyundai Accent, but they gave me a Hyundai Sonata!\n\nReturn\n- This is VERY fast and the best part.  Come in to the returning entrance and your exit will be the very last one.  Once you drive in, just hand the worker your keys and you will get a receipt in your email\n- They do add $200 to your total but it's apparently the deposit.
