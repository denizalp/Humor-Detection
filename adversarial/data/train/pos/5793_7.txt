The reason we are giving one star is that we had a do not disturb sign on the door, despite that they woke us up by calling over the phone, to ask if we need the room to be cleaned.! \nWhen I tried to explain to them that was wrong action, the front desk worker kept arguing with us that do not disturb sign only mean: do not knock on door, that's why they called over phone, so we were disturbed in another way, thank you Delta Hotel for disturbing your customers !
