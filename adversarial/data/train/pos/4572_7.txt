I love the location and atmosphere but wasn't a big fan of the coffee. I ordered a plain full fat latte and my partner went with an iced drip coffee. Maybe I ordered too basic of a drink and should've gone with something fancier, but I was just wasn't blow away. Crazy because they are using Counter Culture coffee which is delicious! I was very disappointed with the ice coffee, it wasn't good, definitely not what I would've expected from a place specializing in coffee. The latte was good, but just that. Very average for a latte. Maybe I should've ordered a nitro coffee, that seemed super fancy and I have never seen anything like it before! Since the reviews are SO positive, I'll give them another shot in the future, but was fairly disappointed during my first visit!
