I went to dinner on a Thursday night with a group of 9 fellow Yelpers to celebrate a special occasion. Glad we had reservations because the place got packed in just a few minutes. It was very dark and very loud. We spent most of the night yelling, \"WHAT?\"  across the table. Some even ended up texting each other during dinner. Our service was pleasant and all of our food came out in under 10 minutes. I ordered the hot and spicy soup and the veggie dumplings. Everyone at our table was pleased with their orders. The drinks were typical Vegas Strip prices, but I heard that they were delicious. Our waiter brought us a HUGE dessert tray to share in honor of the special occasion. I think the dessert plate may have been the highlight of the evening.
