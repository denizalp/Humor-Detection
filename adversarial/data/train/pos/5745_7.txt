I came here with my nephew! Super excited to have lunch. Until something bad happened. I have salad with moving. There was a grasshopper in my salad!!! Yes. You read that right. I freaked out.  I didn't know what to do. I didn't want to scare the customers in the restaurant. So I nonchalantly grabbed the bowl of salad and brought it up to the front. I showed her. She automatically apologize. Took the bowl and gave me a free coupon for my next meal. I don't want a free coupon. I'm appalled... Does this mean they don't wash their salad?
