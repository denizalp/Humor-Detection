This is such a hidden gem in Montreal. They make one of my favorite cappuccinos in town. I really enjoy the decor of the place. It is a great location to drop by to read a book or study. Sometimes, it can feel very busy as it is a popular spot. It is highly recommended as a great date spot as it's got the perfect mix of uniqueness and busy environment of a coffee shop with special decors. I always recommend the treats as well, baked goods are worth it to compliment your cappuccino.
