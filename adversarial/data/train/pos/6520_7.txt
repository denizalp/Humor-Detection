The Persian Saffron and Rose Water ice cream with crushed pistachios and their Persian Rose Water iced tea here at Flame Kabob are the stars here. Im a fan of rosy floral notes in my teas and dessert. So my attention was paid more to tea and ice cream! I haven't had the chance to try the meats or have a full meal just yet.\n\nI was originally introduced to Persian ice cream back in the 80's.The one I had here was just as authentic as how my friend's mom made it. Big plus ice cream is made from scratch! Saffron and Rose was fragrant when I took off the lid of the cup. The two flavors go well together.  \n\nThe placard signs on the street advertising Gyro lunch special for $5.99 is what caught my eye and lead me here initially. Besides Gyros,Beef,Chicken and lamb kabobs, they have 3 different kinds of soup, sides like Babaghanoush, Hummus and Dolmeh.\n\nHummus was good, spiced just right for me. Texture, smooth hardly any graininess, almost whipped light, wasnt the thick pasty kind. The flat bread tasted good too. It was made to order,so it was nice and warm when they served it to me. \n\nDolmeh was perfect snack size portion. Served chilled on bed of greens topped with a sliced tomato.\n\nThe menu prices varies here from the deal mentioned above, to reasonable under 10 dollar combo meals up to the pricey (IMO) $20 for 2 lamb combo deal. Yeah..dunno about that.  \n\nIt's a small fast\/casual restaurant. No table service. Order and pay at counter. Dining area is simple set up down one side of the wall with couple tables and 1 long table for larger group. The place was fairly clean, but felt a bit cluttered. Food prep area appeared to be clean as well. \n\nStaff friendly. Everybody knows what they are doing. My order came out fairly quick.\n\nThis new Flame Kabob location is: Warm Springs Promenade. The backside of the restaurant faces Marks St near Big Lots. \n\nSo far it's A+ ok for me! I know I will be a bigger fan when I get around to trying the kabobs!
