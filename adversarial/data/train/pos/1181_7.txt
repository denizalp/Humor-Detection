I am not a Haunted house person. They really scare me and i do not like to be scared. However, this one is quite different. They have a lot from different movie sets.  It is dark, but bright enough were you trip or get hurt.I have been to some places where you cannot see in front of you.. I did have a few small freights and a few bigger ones. But, since my boyfriend was there i felt OK.                                                                                                                            It smells clean,which may sound odd but, some of those places smell gross.                               I think that it is really good for older children as well. Maybe like 12 and up. Depending on the child of course.  Lots of parking in the back and at $2.00 very reasonable.  I highly recommend for your Halloween fun!
