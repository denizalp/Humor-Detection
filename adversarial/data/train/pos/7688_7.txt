Spread, apply, breathe, RIPPP -- ouch! That's how a typical brazilian wax goes down. No pun intended. I am bad at maintenance and consistency, so sometimes that can mean a task fit for a weed wacker rather than a waxer.  I am also a groupon groupie, so I love flash sales on top of groupons. (Hello $10-$13 waxes!) \n\nSkintastic Studio is actually just a single room inside Canyon Falls Spa+Salon and there's only one lady that does the waxing, Raj. When making an appointment, be sure to leave a voicemail as its her personal cell phone. Also, when you do your undressing, she stays in the room with you, but the lights are dim enough so that it's not as awkward as you think. There are no prep wipes either, so if you're self-conscious, do a little check in the bathroom beforehand. \n\nThe wax literally took 5 minutes. It's the fastest Brazilian I've had. I had a lot of hair, so it was also the one that hurt the most. I noticed she didn't do any tweezing of strays like other waxers tend to do. At the end, she applied grape seed oil and powder, but I'd stay away from the powder as I wasn't sure if it contained talc or not. (Talc=bad for you)\n\nI wouldn't say this is my favorite waxing place in town, but Raj was definitely efficient, friendly, and didn't force too much conversation. I was in and out in no time.
