Well... The food here is good.  I like the chicken quesadilla for sure.  But the real reason to go to this place is the cookies!  The best cookie ever made is sold here : an oatmeal butterscotch chip masterpiece.  Also--an white chocolate chip pecan craisin cookie.  a legendary gingersnap--and I hate gingersnaps.  lemon bars!  five layer brownies!  chocolate creme cookies!  pumpkin bars which my god are ridiculously good.\n\nit's very mesa-y and homey (not like hardcore homey, come on now) and the decor is countryish.  but if you want good cookies\/desserts and decent food, go there.\n\none more thing--they have this frosted sugar cookie which everyone claims is the best thing in the whole place.  lofty assertion, indeed.  you should make your own decision...
