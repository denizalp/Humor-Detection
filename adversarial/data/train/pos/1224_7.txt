Both Paul and Rebecca did a wonderful job in our condo for the bed bug problem. They guaranteed results. Rightly so, we didn't have any sightings after two treatments. \n\nPaul and Rebecca understood our concerns about having children around during the treatment. Assured us the spray they use is safe and odourless. They used the dry steamer to treat the upholstered furniture like mattresses and couches. \n\nThe three-months warranty Armour Pest Control gives is real. They are available, trustworthy, respond promptly and deliver as they say. Thank you so much Paul and Rebecca. We are glad to have reached out to you.
