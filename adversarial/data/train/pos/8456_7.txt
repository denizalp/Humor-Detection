I've never been to an ENT before, but...as far as doctor visits go -- I had a great experience here today. \n\nMy new doctor had recommended that I see an ENT - - severe nasal issues caused by my allegies. The Dr's asst recommended that I call Dr. Baldree among the list of all the other recommended ENT's. Dr Baldree's listing had a website, when others did not... so of course I checked out their website. \n\nOn the website they state that they're the \"Official ENT Dr for the AZ Diamondbacks\". I figure they must be good for me too. :)\n\nFirst of all, the receptionist Dee... was a delight to chat with when booking my appt. Very friendly and professional.... she guided me to where I could print out some forms online, to save time during my visit. \n\nAnd then... I was even lucky enough to get a next day appt. Sweet!\n\nWhen i arrived, Dee was just as pleasant in person as she was on the phone. :) And also Dr. Baldree was great - - super compassionate and caring. \n\nThe office was very nice and comfortable decor. \n\nThe doctor gave me a couple nasal spray samples... and thankfully the tools he used didn't make my nose tickle as much as the regular doctors. ha!\n\nIf you're looking for an ENT physician, I would highly, highly recommend Dr. Baldree.
