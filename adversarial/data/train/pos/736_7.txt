I had a gift card. \n\nAnd a hungry almost-3-year-old. \n\nSo we had ourselves a little date. \n\nJust Mommy and him. He had the corn dog. Mommy had the bleu cheese burger. (Which didn't taste very bleu to Mommy.) \n\nBaby boy enjoyed Red the Robin (clever name, that) who was walking around handing out high-fives. \n\nTotal kid-friendly chain. Loud. Very loud. Almost unbearable. Hard to hear my kids \"NOMS\" and \"I wike dis corn dog, Mommy!\" from just across our tiny table. \n\nMy kid was angelic compared to some of the others in there. That was a first. (I ain't all high and mighty. My kid is a brat sometimes, too.) But yeah, totally take your kids here if they're unruly little shits in restaurants. It will go almost completely unnoticed. The wait staff have adjusted and even fine-tuned themselves to it. \n\nBottomless fries for fat, American asses. (I didn't get a refill cuz I'm not THAT fat.) \n\nIn closing:  Typical chain. Greasy burgers. Sensory assault from all angles. Nothing special. At all.
