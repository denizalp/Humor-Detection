-----------------------------\nCause I gotta have Spice...\n\nBrunch at Mesa sure was nice\nIf I can thank you Bobby\nI know not everybody\nHas got a Bloody Mary like you\n\nBut I figured I'd find vice\nInstead you knocked me out my socks\nI know it's not nice to gawk\nBut the presentation was so good, yahooooo!   \n\n'Cause I gotta have spice...\nMmm, I gotta have spice\n'Cause I gotta have spice, spice,\nMm 'cause I gotta have spice-a-spice-a-spice\n----------------------------\n\nBobby Flay threw it down and the earth shook my friends... like an old man returning cold soup in a deli....  I bow to his domination of southwestern cuisine and his ability to harness all of its great flavors.  \n\nCame to Mesa Grill for brunch and the Spicy Chicken and Sweet Potato Hash with Poached Egg.  All the many flavors blended so well into a spicy hot sweet twist on an eggs benedict which left you wanting more.  I also had a large chunk of the Mesa Burger (thanks Michelle T.) which was a ginormous piece of meat perfectly cooked w\/ a nice pinkish hue.        \n\nThe Spicy Bloody Mary was the best I've ever had.  You can tell this \"wake-me-up\" concoction was all muddled from fresh ingredients because...  it just tasted sooo good especially after a late night of gambling and drinking.\n\nThe cornucopia of corn breads are to die for (all free w\/ meal).  From corn cranberry currant scones to savory jalapeno, sweet pepper, onion breads.  A \"wow\" is the most fitting word to describe.\n\nIf you go to Vegas and don't eat at Mesa... you never really went to Vegas (period)\n\n***Thank you Lauren B. for being the \"purveyor of fine foods on Yelp!\"***
