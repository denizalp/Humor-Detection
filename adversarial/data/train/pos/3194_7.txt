I really liked our experience.  Our salesman, Brad, never once pressured us.  We told him what we were looking for, he pointed out where they were and waited until we had questions. Every other furniture store we had gone to that day the sales staff hovered, pushed, pressured and wouldn't leave us alone. \n\n And when we didn't like the product, they would try to get us to sit on it again and try it again.  I'm sorry, but I know if it isn't what I'm looking for. I don't need someone who doesn't know how we live or what we like telling me something that sucks is great.\n\nThe store had Despicable Me playing on multiple televisions and my daughter was just in heaven. She could help us pick a sectional and still watch her movie.  Or she would stay at a display while we discussed an item and she was only a few feet away where we could watch her the whole time.  Genius, Mor!!! Absolutely genius.\n\nWe left happy, and unlike other experiences I have yet to feel an ounce of buyers remorse.  \n\nThe delivery for the sectional went quickly, smoothly, and at the time they said.  And the product is exactly what we saw in the store.  It looks great and I really feel like it will last us for years.
