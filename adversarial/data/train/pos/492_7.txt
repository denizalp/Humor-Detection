I have had the opportunity to work with Carolinas Metro Realty several times now through out the years. I highly recommend them they have helped a friend with a short sale, and I recently have hired them for the property management of my house in Charlotte. \n\nThe staff and owner Yuriy are so friendly and easy to work with. They get back to me immediately with any concerns I might have and have answered all my questions (and trust me I had a lot) when it came to my house.\n\nMy house was rented immediately after they took it over and I know that it's in good hands. The best part is they have taken all the worry away from me as a homeowner now landlord.  I don't have to worry about a thing and I know my house is in good hands.\n\nWhether you are selling, renting, short sale, or any other kind of real estate transaction you can count on the team at Carolinas Metro Realty.  They take their business seriously and treat their customers right.
