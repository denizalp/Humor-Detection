I've been a member to this gym since the beginning!\n\nIt's a great place to train and not worry about crowds of people standing around doing nothing, taking up every piece of equipment.  If you are serious about getting in shape or training hardcore, this is the gym for you!\n\nBe sure to ask for my good friend Erin, she's an awesome trainer, very knowledge about fitness and nutrition, always willing to go the extra mile for her clients. She's also a fitness competitor as well, so she practices everything she teaches, she'll get you in shape, that's a fact!
