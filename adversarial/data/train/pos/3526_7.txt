I didn't think I'd find a better place than Andy's Foot Spa(which is closed now), but boy was I wrong. I've been to reflexology places all over but I think this is probably the best one I've been to this far because I feel like they really do focus on that. It's not just massaging and getting the knots out. I don't know, maybe I'm looking to deep into it lol.\n\nAnyways, it is located on Spring Mtn kinda in the cut. Small building but it's actually HUGE inside. And hella dark too. But it's cool cause it's all divided off and shit so it's kinda more \"private.\" There was about 2 beds to a \"room.\"\n\nSo they start off with the tub of water and for some reason, I felt like my feet were in there for quite some time. Lol. He started with my head. Then my neck. Then my back. All while laying on my back. Then he moves to my feet and legs. After that, he tells me to turn around and take my shirt off. And then he undid my bra, luckily the place was all bordered off, otherwise, acca-awkward. So he starts massaging my back and my arms, and even my ass. But it felt nice. Then came the hot stones. LOVELY.\n\nAll in all it was a great massage. I walked out feeling like a new person. And I even slept hella good. Seriously for 20 bucks an hour, you really can't go wrong. And don't be a douche when it comes to tipping. Even $10 ain't gonna break your wallet.
