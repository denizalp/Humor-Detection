Positives:\n-gall darn ENORMOUS. (no, I don't usually say things like \"gall darn,\" but the cheesiness of this place makes my inner Midwesterner come out.)\n-really great beer! Especially the Stone Age Imperial Stout, but the Goggle Fogger Hefeweizen (which sounds vaguely dirty) was not bad either.\n-pretty good food -- GREAT fries.\n\nNegatives:\n-Super saccharine wait staff. This guy was like someone straight out of Tchotchkes' from Office Space: \"Yo duuudes! How about some pizza shooters, jalape√±o poppers or extreme fajitas?!\"\n-the menu is blindingly busy and made me wanna barf it was so childish. It had little lame catch-phrases that didn't make sense, such as the long-winded explanation about why you could only get fries with the burgers and chips with the \"sandos.\" (- much like THIS long-winded sentence.) I used to love menu features like this when I was, like, twelve.\n\nboth positive and negative:\n-it's waythefuck out in an area I never go to, ever. This could be annoying, but it's sort of fun to have a destination to go to for good beer.\n\nI'd go back for sure, so long as I'm drinkin'.\n\nP.S. The \"Damn Straight\" burger is pretty damn good.
