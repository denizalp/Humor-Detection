Im a gold member with hertz. Yet again, another great location. (So im thinking)\nBooked my vehicle online for the Phoenix Nascar race, flew in and had to go to the little hut in the parking garage and stand in line. WHY!! \nThen the gentleman was gonna put us in a midsized chevy malibu when i was paying for a full sized vehicle. Walked back and told the guy this was absolutely not going to happen. He then put us in a minivan.\nThis location has issues.\nI dont think I will use Hertz again at this location.
