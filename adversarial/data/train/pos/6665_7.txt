I have a friend who is a big oaf.  One day, the oaf managed to get a .357 round lodged quite soundly in his handgun.  As I saw him head to the drawer full of hammers, I proposed that we take it to a local firearms dealer, since they must deal with this scenario often.\n\nLucky for us, ATF was conveniently located down the street.  The gentlemen behind the counter took a quick gander at the fastened firearm, and then headed for their drawer full of hammers.  Using a piece of wood dowel, they dislodged the shell without a series of unfortunate events unfolding.\n\nThe charge for this service?  A hearty handshake.\n\nSo, we visited for a spell and found out about their CCW class, which led into a big discussion regarding their Machine Gun Safari.  This sure wasn't the kind of colloquy that liberal bedtime stories are made of.\n\nAs soon as I get the time, I'm rounding up a few acquaintances and heading to ATF for a day of male bonding and firepower.\n\nIn other news... I can see where the ATF Girls could be offensive to some, like Misty, whose point of view is completely valid.\n\nPersonally speaking, I have a penchant for girls in tight shirts, breasts peeking out the bottoms, all holding guns and posing for the camera with a come-hither look.  As Jim Carrey would say (in Dumb & Dumber), \" I like it a-laht \".\n\nBut not to worry, I'm seeing a therapist twice a week.\n\n~Swoop
