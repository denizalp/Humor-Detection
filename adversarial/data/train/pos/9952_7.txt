3.5 stars. \n\nGood alternative to overpaying for a round of golf in Vegas. This nine-hole, par-3 course is a fun, no-frills track that's perfect for squeezing in a quick nine before the rest of your Sin City activities. \n\nMy brother and I stopped in after 4pm and the starter gave us the last tee time of the day. He said the lights would be going on and that they'd be closing soon, but we'd have enough time to finish our round. True to his word, we were on the ninth green just as his assistant was pulling up to take out the last flag for the day.\n\nI enjoyed my round here. Although some of the fairways and rough were dried out due to the winter cold, the greens were in decent shape. There were some nice elevation changes between some of the holes and bunkers on a few. Most holes were between 110-120 yards, with the 9th being the longest at 170 yards. \n\nThis course was a nice change of pace from the typical Vegas action. The starter and his assistant were friendly. It's definitely more of a locals-only than tourist trap and it's only a 15-20 minute drive from the Strip. Since we were there on a weekday, my brother and I paid $8 each and I \"splurged\" for a pull cart for an additional $2. This reminded me of home in SoCal, where I can get my golf fix for less than the price of a movie ticket. It was a welcome relief to my wallet after a few days of paying regular Vegas prices for food, drink, and entertainment.
