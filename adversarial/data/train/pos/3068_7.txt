WHAT A HIDDEN GEM. \n\nThis property is truly a hidden gem in every sense of the word. I am typically a Vegas hotel snob, but for Labor Day weekend my friends and I decided to try something more budget friendly, and I was able to get an amazing rate through Booking.com. \n\nFirst and foremost, not only is this property recently renovated, it is CLEAN, and the staff was extremely friendly.\n\nOur room, was a bit small, but for the price, and the location, I couldn't have complained even if I wanted to. The room had a Keurig Coffee Maker and decent bedding. \n\nLOCATION: Amazing.  Situated right across from Mirage and right in front of the Venetian, with your room door about 300 yards from the strip (through a security locked door) you can't go wrong. You don't have to go through a maze of a casino or trek an elevator 24 floors. Just a quick walk and you are on the strip. This was especially useful because we typically go to the clubs at Encore and Wynn, which were walking distance from the hotel. \n\nBasically, this property, was a steal of a deal, with a great location. And while I always prefer to live lavishly at Aria, I can't complain with a great deal, at an amazing price on a holiday weekend from Booking.com. #fantastic
