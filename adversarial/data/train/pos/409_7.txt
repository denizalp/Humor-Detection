WARNING: DO NOT get your wedding flowers here...\n\n...you're better off to go to a convenience store.\n\nI recently got married and hired Pink Twig to do my flowers.  I was pretty specific, even providing photographs of what I wanted.  I had been a customer for about two years, buying a few random bouquets here & there and even though they were a bit pricey and had no customer service skills I thought they'd step up for a wedding. Wrong. \n\nI was a busy bride on the day and didn't see the flowers until two hours prior, what a mess, they were the wrong colours.  I mean wrong, as in they should have been white & pink and instead they were orange & purple.  I had my girlfriend run to the nearest flower shop and buy a bunch of neutral flowers, whatever she could find last minute and went on with the day.  When I got back from my honeymoon I went by the store to ask them what happened, I figured my order obviously got mixed up and someone else got my flowers.  The owners, Amy & Tanya denied they'd gotten anything wrong and actually got aggressive & angry with me for even questioning them.  After I showed them the photos stapled to our original agreement they still wouldn't own up.  \n\nWhen I told them I was very disappointed and was going to review the shop they threatened to call their lawyers and sue me for slander.  They are crazy.  Do yourself a favour, just stay away.
