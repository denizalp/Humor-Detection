I was in the area, and wanted to check out something other, than the regular places I go.  So I used my fabulous yelp app.  And found this place.  I go in to check it out.  As I'm looking at the menu, the girl that takes my order stands there.  I told her I wasn't ready yet.  She still stood there.  I took at least 5 min.  So I decided to go with a salad, with the Carne Estada.  But as I looked around, I see they don't have a Salsa bar!  Whoaaaa, are you serious, no Salsa, no Jalapenos\/Seranos.....Ok, would have given 5 stars.  So my salad came, and it looked yummy, and it was!  I just wish I had some Jalapenos\/Seranos, and Salsa!
