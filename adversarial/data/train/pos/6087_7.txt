I usually don't like writing reviews for places that already have a ton of reviews....unless it was just a horrible, horrible experience. But Yelp won't stop putting it in the corner of my home screen because I made a reservation through the link they provided. So, here we go. \n\nThis place was a lot better than I expected. I've always heard it was a cool place with belly dancers, and of course, guys love it. I appreciate good dancers, but I always found it awkward when I'm eating my food for a girl to come up and shake her body around me. I actually got up and danced with her...the powerful influence of beer. Only one, might I add. Yes, I'm a lightweight. \n\nThis is the course dinner they give you. \n\n-Lentil Soup & Bread - I normally do not like lentil soup, but theirs was made very well. \n-Shrimp Scampi - I don't know if this is really a Moroccan dish, but it was amazing.\n-Hummus & Zaaluk- Both were okay, they give you pickled veggies to dip in it. \n-Beef Kabob - the meat was good, but not very tender. I wanted to eat the pineapple it  was served with more than the beef.\n-Chicken Platter - It was served on top of cous cous and cabbage. The cous cous was my favorite part. The chicken was very tender and seemed stewed for quite some time. It reminded me a lot of Filipino adobo. I enjoyed this dish. \n-B'Stilla - this was a crisp pastry filled with the same ingredients as baklava. It was okay for me. I'm not very big into Baklava because I hate nuts in general.\n- Mint Tea - They give you an entire pot of this hot tea. \n\nI think the service is good and you should usually come with a group of people. A lot of people like this place, and I can see why just for the atmosphere. It is good food, and they are quick to serve you. It is a lot of food, so go hungry. The prices are a little too much in my opinion, but this is close to the strip. It's hard to find a good deal with food that's worth the price they're charging. *ALWAYS make a reservation*
