Okay, my friend and I were looking for a place to eat lunch. We read the reviews claiming this place has the best tacos in laveen. \nOur first clue should have been that we are the only ones inside on a friday at lunch. I had carne asada tacos and friend had shrimp. \nI have to say I take a joke pretty good. I thought about posting a great review, kicking back and laughing at the poor guy who enters after us. I can in good conscience do that to another human.\nAfter being over charged by a buck our food came out. My first bite and I thought I was eating road kill from out on baseline road. Wow I will need to gargle with acid to rid my poor taste buds of this flavor. \nThe shrimp were covered in a dough, next time hide the shrimp better, we managed to find them in the dough this time. The flavor was bland.\nHey the soda fountain worked well and produced good flavor!
