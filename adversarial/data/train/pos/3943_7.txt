When our Italian friends who own a pasta company in NJ suggested we come here for dinner, I had to trust them! And boy did this place deliver a fine evening. The food is served family style, so coming with a group of six was perfect! Here's what we shared...\n\nBread Basket - It featured an assortment of three different breads with olive oil and butter to go with it. Two of the breads reminded me of focaccia - one with onions and the other with tomato. These were my favorites! They were light, fluffy and moist! The last Bread was one I didn't try, but hubby sure seemed to enjoy it!\n\nCaesar Salad - Ever since giving birth two months ago, I have constantly craved the crunch of romaine. So this salad was particularly attractive to me. The croutons were huge, but there weren't too many to be overwhelming. There was just the right amount of dressing so that everything was covered without being soggy. A plate of three anchovies were served on the side. I think our moms were the only ones to indulge in those. \n\nShrimp in Red Sauce - I'm not a seafood fan at all, but I had to at least try this. The shrimp was quite firm and didn't have the unappealing fishy taste. And I really enjoyed the full sized cooked tomatoes that were in the sauce!\n\nVeal Parmigiana - I've never had parmigiana in my life and I'm so glad I finally have! The crispy breading provided a nice texture with the melted mozzarella. I think this was the most flavorful of all the meats on the table. \n\nPenne with Ragu - The meatballs in the ragu were probably the next most flavorful meat. The sausage and pork were a bit more simple and took a back seat to the delicious tomato sauce. And I was crazy for the past! It was cooked perfectly and seasoned perfectly. \n\nWhat a wonderful evening of sharing with friends and family. This is such a great place for a special evening!
