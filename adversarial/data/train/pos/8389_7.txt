Wow. You want a \"locals'\" casino? Here it is. Nobody in their right mind would venture to the Poker Palace while here on vacation. It's like they took a flea market, shook it up, and dumped it into a casino-shaped building. *shudders*\n\nI have to say, though, they have an excellent-for-beginners No Limit poker tournament here at 6pm nightly, for an affordable buy-in of $25. There are rebuys, though, which is very frustrating when you're playing your best game, and some yahoo is going mad, doubling up then going out then buying back in over and over and over again. And, like I said, it's a locals' joint, and the locals will let you know how they feel if you're an outsider and you knock them out.\n\nThere's a little concession stand near the poker room that sells pretty good bugers, dogs, and cheese fries, which can be a nice consolation prize when you're standing on the rail.
