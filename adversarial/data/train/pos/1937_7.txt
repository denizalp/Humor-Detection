My fiancee is going to be EXTREMELY upset. I came here sort of by accident, but if it worked out, how can I complain?\n\nMy first Chicago-style food experience was in a small hidden place in Tucson during my undergrad years. My fiancee and I went every Wednesday for wings. Having moved away from Tucson, we have been constantly searching for similar style food.\n\nI just found it, and my fiancee is all the way in Taiwan right now.\n\nFor me, one of the particularly unique and amazing Chicago-style dishes are their hot wings. They don't use the boring old \"Frank's Hot Sauce\", they have their own proprietary blend that seems to have the perfect blend of spicy and savoriness. While most places use 100% Frank's, which is a little too vinegary for me, this place has their own unique style. Seriously, their wings are really good.\n\nWings are no good without pizza, so I ordered a slice of cheese pizza too. Again, very unique pizza. The crust was extremely unorthodox, giving the pizza a \"new-car feel\" to it. The sauce was also a bit on the sweet side, but overall, everything played out in perfect harmony.\n\nTo top off some really good food, the service is really nice as well. Very helpful people over here that genuinely care if you enjoyed your meal.\n\nI'm really excited to go back and try some of their other food. I seriously can't tell you how excited I am that I found this place. Life is going to be much better now.
