It's a fast food type of place but it doesn't seem like the other fast food establishments. It's clean, modern, spacious and it smells good. They even have good handwash.\n\nFor bulking season, I tried this place and got me a chicken tenders combo with fries. You get a sauce but you can get more sauces for extra. I tried the garlic sauce and ranch. The garlic sauce was sweet and didn't taste like garlic. The price isn't bad. The chicken was not mystery chicken parts. They have sandwiches, salads, burgers, shakes, etc.
