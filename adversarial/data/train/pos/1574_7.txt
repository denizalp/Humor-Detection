Why is this place so cheesy?! It's like a satellite of the distant suburbs where only chain stores and primary colours exist. And yet, they show great movies, and they are located close to delicious pre-movie dinner options, and the chairs in the cinema are comfy and always clean, and they still have 7$ movie Tuesdays. I wish we lived in a golden age of cinema where excellently curated films showed in beautiful venues with delicious food and drinks served, but we do not and therefore the Forum is top of the local movie pile.
