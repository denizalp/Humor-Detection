So you say you want to hear about this steak...well let me indulge you\nin this experience... 14oz Bone-in Filet Mignon!\n\nWhen it first arrives it seems a bit intimidating, bulky even. You see\nthis piece of meat and think, I see nothing special or glorious about\nthis, let alone why it would cost $57. If anything, this chunk of meat\nwould be thought dry due to being over-cooked, or too bloody from\nbeing too thick to cook properly. So you first cut into it with your\naverage steak knife, and what do you find? \n\nThis knife, though somewhat blunt, seamlessly slices through the thickness. The tenderness is AMAZING!! Not only that, there is no trail of blood typically found with such large portions of meat cooked over a fire. \n\nThen comes the first bite. Words can not truly describe the sensation, but the closest I can come up with is that it feels like a meatgasm in your mouth. Hahahaha but seriously, the flavour from the seasoning of the steak was phenomenal, robust and savory with a hint of a wood burned taste. Once you've slightly regained consciousness from the amazing flavour of the steak, you then realise the meat is moist and tender that it literally melts in your mouth. You chew with little to no\npressure and it still falls apart in your mouth, then mixing\ncompletely in your mouth. \n\nBut when you think it can't get any better,\nyou continue to chew thinking you never want this feeling in your\nmouth to end. You eventually realise that it does need to end, that\nyou will need to swallow. It then becomes a bitter sweet moment, when you think of how you must end it by swallowing, but knowing there will be another to come soon afterwards. Yet when eating, the following bites are never as wondrous as the initial...except for this steak.\n\nEach bite was as good as the first. Every single bite left me with the\nsame feelings as the first. And no matter how full I was becoming,\nthere was no hesitation in each bite, no thoughts of stopping due to\nover-consumption. There was only one thought in mind...ME WANT MORE STEAK NOW!!! Even to the last bite, which I then cut into 3 more\npieces to try and extend this experience, it was wonderful throughout.\nI will be back for this steak...
