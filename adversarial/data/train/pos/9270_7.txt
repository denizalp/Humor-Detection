I havent made it to too many breweries in my drinking days but this one is a must if you are so inclined. It really has it all. Its tight outside of main city Pittsburgh in a smaller town called Homestead which makes it super convenient whenever you're in the Pittsburgh area. \nThe brewery resembled an old warehouse but had all tge fixings of a local bar type feel. \nA favorite of mine was the cowbell nitro stout. A milk stout infused with chocolate and oatmeal hints but not too filling although it tasted like a yummy chocolate milkshake. \nAnother notable mention was Voodoo Lovechild. A fruitier Belgian Ale that taste more like a refreshing beach cocktail than a beer. At a whopping 8.5% alcohol content be careful not to drink too many of these unless of course you brought a designated driver. Hahaha...lesson learned. \nThe atmosphere was super friendly and super cool. Everyone mingling and acted as if we were all good friends. \nProps lined  the walls and corners all within a voodoo type darker theme. But were interesting and sometimes hilarious to notice. The ceilings had great paintings and were well decorated\nService was super. I cannot comment on the food selection as my belly was reserved for all beer on this particular day. Although they had a chicken and waffle truck right  outside the building that many bar dwellers seemed to be enjoying. I will def save some room for this novelty next time. \nClassic games such as Clue, Scrabble, Checkers, Yahtzee, and Candy Land were offered for play if the mood so struck\nBe sure to take a friend who knows how to have a good time like BJ A and I and your day\/night cannot go wrong.    \nDefinitely cannot wait to return!!!
