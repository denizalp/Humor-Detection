Instead of going anywhere fancy for my birthday this year, I was really just craving some comfort food with variety and creativity.  It was this past Saturday, and they only take reservations after 9pm.  It was packed when we went in, but no line.  The owner managed to squeeze the two of us in at the bar.\n\nEven snuggled in the corner right at Baldwin and McCaul, it's a great location for this little place!  The decor is a split between Guu and Kinton, but much... cozier.  The big PLUS, is the two plasma TVs they have on the walls.  I heard they usually play Kpop repeats, but that night they were playing the football game (Go Vikings)!\n\nLined up behind the bar are 3 flavours of mixers for your choosing, ready to be mixed with 3 oz of soju.  They also have different soju cocktails, beers on tap, and several wines on the menu, all fairly priced.  I opted for a boring glass of pear juice from the carton.  Really, I wish I wasn't so hungover from the night before 'cause it definitely suppressed my usual appetite to get EVERYTHING on the menu.  Instead. we got...\n\nKimchi Poutine: $5.95 (4\/5 stars)\nSo for those who know me, or at least read my reviews, you'd know I would have to get this! I mean, it's a POUTINE!  My date and I are not usually a fan of kimchi, but this was really good, with actual cheese and gravy.  Too bad they weren't actual curds, and definitely NOT ENOUGH CHEESE!!! (I think I've said that in EVERY ONE of my reviews by now).\n\nKimchi 3 Ways: $4.95 (2\/5 stars)\nThis is not the same dish as the kimchi flights.  This is a trio consisting of ssam- 2 mini packages of pork wrapped in cabbage leaves, 2 mini takoyaki balls, and a mini dish of kimchi over a little bit of cold tofu.  It was ok, not really worth it.\n\nPanko Cod: $9.95 (1\/5 stars)\nBiggest disappointment of the night.  I really wanted to get the Bulgogi burger or the Kalbi philly cheese, but being a sucker for fried fish really screwed me over this time.  Cod filets fried probably ahead of time so that it was cold, dried, and NOT crispy, over a light smear of egg salad (yum), sandwiched between 2 slices of boring white bread that was barely even toasted. Shootballs!!! Consider yourselves warned.\n\nGrilled Beef Tongue: $5.95 (4\/5 stars)\nI LOVE tongue!! Oohhh yyeeaaaa!! Pretty good portion too! Some places braise it to its max tenderness, they grill it here.  Still super tender with thicker pieces.  On it's own it's bland, but I guess that's why it was served with 3 dipping sauces.\n\nSquash Duk Bok Ki: $5.95 (5\/5 stars)\nBy far my favourite here! Novelty, taste, spice, rice cakes, CHEESE... This one WINS! Baked with oozey cheese inside a squash, cut and served tableside. The only thing that MIGHT make it better... maybe, just MAYBE if it was bacon-wrapped, then deep-fried, then drenched with gravy... am I the only one in another world?!\n\nPEI Mussels: $5.95 (4\/5 stars)\nCooked perfectly, a small portion of mussels in a gochujang sauce (although it tastes very similar to a red curry broth). Simple pleasure.\n\nService: (3\/5 stars)\nVery pleasant and knowledgeable servers.  However, the food does take quite a long time.  The server although very nice and all, did forget a few simple things such as water, side plates, etc.  \n\nAll that for two people only came up to just under $60!! I really wanted to try a couple yakitori and the chowder, but they ran out!  So of course I have to come back... also for the bouillabaise, the pork kakune, the gochu rellenos, the burger, the kalbi philly cheese!! Oh, and next time, I'll definitely booze it up!  Anyone??
