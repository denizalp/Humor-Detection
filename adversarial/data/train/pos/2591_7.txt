Wow, what happened to this place? The food and service were once so fantastic I couldn't wait to come back! I brought friends from out of town as I had been raving about it for a while. Boy, was I embarrassed. Our waitress (who needed to sit down or 'squat' beside you to get your order) seemed, umm, stoned? Had a hard time remembering our orders, and we waited ages for everything. It was over 2 hours for dinner and we didn't even have a dessert. We asked 3 times (different staff) for the bill and it finally came 40 minutes later. I've never had such slow, uninterested services, and it wasn't only us that were affected. The heat was so hot in the place they had to crack the doors open as we were literally sweating (it's February). And then there's the food.... the appetizers were decent. The sunday roast took nearly an hour to arrive at our table and it was, well, average to good I guess. The once fabulous steak and ale pie was now about as good as a frozen one from your grocery store, dry and quite salty. And where is that beautiful gravy they used to serve? They now have overly-saged, bland gravy. SOOOOO disappointing, we wont' bother returning ever. I'm guessing either the owners changed, or the chef left with his recipes and cooking skills. It shows.
