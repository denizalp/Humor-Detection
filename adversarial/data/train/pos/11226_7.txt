I went here the other with somewhat high expectations. I've heard a lot of people say that they liked the show. Now, these are people who have never seen cirque du soleil shows and people who have. I thought it'd be at least a decent show. I, however did not like the show that much. Maybe because it's not my cup of tea? I'm not really into sensual shows or things like that. There were only 2 acts that I enjoyed, and they were the hulu-hoop girl and the girls in the water bowl. Those were the only 2 acts that had any acrobatics to the show. All of the other acts bored me, and I just wasn't interested. I believe the couple behind me actually walked out of the show. \n\nIt was funny because I did laugh during bits and pieces of the show.
