It's like dreaming about your crush, but when you finally talk to her, she is just a basic girl... speaking specifically about the $450 A5 Black Tajima-Hokkaido Prefecture, Japan. For months on end, I was dreaming about this special moment... when that piece of premium Wagyu melts in my mouth. In reality, what I got was an overwhelming amount of fat that just clogged up my arteries and left my mouth with a really disgusting aftertaste. I could not eat more than 2-3 slices. The sides of spinach, mushrooms and brussel sprouts were also quite average. One saving grace about this restaurant was the Mashima reserve striploin, which was absolutely delicious (5\/5 stars) and the only cut I will get next time.
