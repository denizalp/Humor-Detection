I'm an oyster eating fool. I don't know what took me so long to get over here, when Arvin T came up with the brilliant idea of stopping in after the Zarkana event, I think I was more excited for dinner than I was the show! \n\nWe show up around 9pm on a Saturday night and there were only a few people ahead of us in line. With only 20 seats at the bar, you're left staring in envy at the people shoveling spoons of goodness in there mouths. You get excited when someone is handed there check, oh good, they're leaving, we are next! \n\nWe are seated and are anxious to order, both of us were so hungry, we contemplated finishing the stew the guy next to us left (just kidding, well maybe) we are given a sourdough roll and some butter, oyster crackers and water. I need food, not fillers. \n\nWe start out with a Caesar Salad (this was really, really good by the way) and an order of Fresh Lump Crab app. We were like scavengers trying to find the last pieces of meat on the plate, it was so good! We then had an order of oysters of the half shell, that night it happened to be Gold Band Oysters from Louisiana. They were enormous, and I wasn't a fan. They were served with cocktail sauce and a dollop of horseradish. I'm generally a lover of smaller oysters like Kusshi and Kumamoto or Fanny Bay, I'm not holding this against them, just wasn't a fan of the taste of these oysters. \n\nThe finale....the Combo Pan Roast. Served with a side of rice, this was the table favorite. Chunks of crab meat and huge pieces of shrimp throughout the stew. The flavor was unreal. This has been haunting me for two days now. \n\nWe were already planning our meal for when we return. I want to come back for the Bouillabaisse or the Cioppino. Arvin has his pick of the Gumbo. Hopefully they'll have some better oysters.
