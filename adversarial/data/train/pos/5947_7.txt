It pains me to give Nove 2 stars. It use to be my go to for fancy Italian. My favorite place in Las Vegas. I would have given every experience before this one 5 stars. Now, I will never return. \nMy first time here was for my boyfriends birthday a few years ago. Since then we had been back for a Chef's tasting with Chef Geno with 15 courses. A few of our favorite dishes included the risotto of the day, Nana's meatballs, chicken Marsala, and the death by potatoes. This was my first and only time dining here since the chef I had grown to love moved on to other ventures. \nI still had faith that Nove would be a great place without Chef Geno. The menu was almost the same. The crowd wasn't. The waiter even mentioned when we asked, that the new chef was \"completely different\". Not bad, just not the same. \nWell I think he was being polite. The exact same chicken Marsala dish looked the same but tasted totally different. The meatballs and potatoes were still decent. The gnocchi was too mushy. And the risotto, oh I wouldn't know as they offered it as the special, and then ran out. I waited 20 minutes and ate my entire appetizer before my drink arrived. And there was no new chef coming out to check on us, see how we liked the food, or introduce himself. This always happened in past times when Nove was not busy. Considering we were there late, and the Chef was in view- it could have happened. \nMaybe my expectations were set too high, but I have had totally different experiences in the past. All of them made me feel great about spending $150-300 for dinner for 2. \nRight now I am thankful I had a discount on my tickets from the Lisa Lampanelli show, because I would have been mad to pay full price last night. \nI really hope N9NE group and Nove figure out a way to put the pieces back together. Chef Geno, we miss you!!
