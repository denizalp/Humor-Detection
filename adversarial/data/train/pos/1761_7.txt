DO NOT EAT HERE, I got the worst FOOD POISONING I've ever had. I would rate zero stars if I could. I had a burritto bowl here last night with steak and pulled pork and in the middle of the night I woke up puking and having diarrhea at the same time. I'm certain I got food poisoning from Chipotle as it's the only meal I ate differently from my family yesterday. I've literally been spewing from both ends at the same time, no exaggeration. I won't be going back to any Chipotles ever again.
