I've never eaten inside the restaurant, and usually pick up food on the way home from work. \nYou can order from Yelp, or use their app (10% off the first order), and they send you an email  to confirm what time your order will be ready. This is really convenient and the ordering process takes just a couple minutes max. \n\nThe staff at the counter are friendly. If you do plan to eat here, there is seating. \n\nWhat to order, you guessed it... Curry. \nYou can have it anyway you want with all the options they have: Chicken, Pork, Vegetables, Noodles, Rice, and so on. \n\nWhat we get is: \nChicken Katsu \nSpicy 5-7\nAdd fried egg, vegetables, extra sauce, and almond slivers & raisins on the side. \nWith all of this food, it is enough for 2 people to share, or you can just save for leftovers. \n\nWe'll be back this soon since this has become a weekly pick up staple for us.
