I really dig the concept of Bulk Barn but usually avoid them because of the nasty-a$$ people that go there and stick their dirty paws into the bins and eat out of them. It really grosses me out and pushes me to buy fully packaged goods, wasting both money and unneeded packaging. \n\nBut I went into this BB because I was in need of some spice jars. I love the simple ones they carry at all of their locations and they only cost about 50-cents each. \n\nWhile I was in this location to pick up the jars, I noticed that it appeared well kept and clean. There were only a couple of other patrons in there at the time and they seemed sanitary, using tongs and scoops. \n\nSo I might give this location another go in the hopes that the funky-folk don't shop here.
