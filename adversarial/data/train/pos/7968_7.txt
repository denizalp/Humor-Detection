Upon pulling  in the parking lot and walking threw the blue door you do not expect this little hole in the wall place to have such wonderful food!  Me an my friends decided that we wanted something different for breakfast then our usual place.  We are willing to try any place once, but this place you can't just try once.  The plates look like something you would get from a fancy French bistro and the quality was excellent.  I had the French toast which was delicious and my friend had the grilled cheese which by the way looks nothing like grilled cheese but still great. This place is definitely a diamond in the rough.  Can't wait to go back!
