I'm giving them a one star and that's being nice. They are terrible !!!! Customer service is HORRIBLE. And they do not know how to make the drinks. I got a French vanilla iced coffee. NOT HARD. It's vanilla and hazelnut!!! I know the drink and they made me latte . Really guys . That's a disgrace. And I've gone there 3 TIMES. Been disappointed all three times. Cmon guys someone needs to go teach them how to really make the drinks. NEVER going there again !!
