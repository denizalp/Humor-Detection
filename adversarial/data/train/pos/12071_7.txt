Noodle Asia is great when it's the wee hours of the morning but you can't handle the idea of going to Grand Lux or a similar casino cafe. I couldn't have handled more eggs by that point! So the noodles and soup were a welcome sight. (Not to mention they sopped up all the alcohol in the stomach). \n\nThe food isn't spectacular by any means but it serves a purpose. A few steps above the take out place in your hometown it works when you need it to. At about 2 am.
