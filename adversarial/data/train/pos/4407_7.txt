EW!!! Avoid this dirty horrible establishment at all costs!! The food was mediocre, the restaurant was empty, and the booths were from 1975. We got chicken curry (meh, watery), pad thai (unmemorable), and crab Rangoon (not bad except ummm no crab or crab flavor), and dynamite rolls (weird, mediocre).  \n\nThen, my boyfriend got FOOD POISONING for the first time in years. We eat out all the time, we eat at Thai places frequently, he didn't not order anything unusual for him. I called the owner to inform her and ask for a refund. \n\nThe conversation with the owner was unbelievable, laughable at best. She kept repeating she sold so many curries last night and no one else complained. She demanded to know what else we ate. and if he was allergic to anything he ordered. I proceeded to explain we did not eat anywhere else and the timing was about right for salmonella. \n\nShe was defensive, argumentative, and inappropriate. At one point she HUNG UP ON ME! She states because she didn't hear me speak. Because I was stunned for 3 seconds at something incredulous that she had said, don't remember what bc there was so much. When she told me salmonella only takes 2 hours, I informed her no it doesn't, and I'm a physician I know it takes about 8 hours onset. \n\nShe then proceeded to mock me and say that what kind of doctor are you? You should be nice to the people and high degree you should be professional. She kept interrupting and at one point, OUT OF THE BLUE, she asked me if I was married and had kids! I told her that was irrelevant and inappropriate and she said something to the extent of, \"you're mean and that's why you're divorced\". \n\n!!!!?? \nI've never been married or divorced and I'm not sure how that comment is allowed from a business owner to a customer. ?!\n\nAnyway, reporting her to the health department. Can I report her to the police too for verbal assault? Haha.
