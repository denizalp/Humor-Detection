Yes there are merchant and business centers with better designs out there.  But this place is here and will be here for a while.  I have enjoyed the conveninece of having the AMC across the street and most of the restaurants within the center offer pretty nice happy hour deals or incentives if you have you movie ticket.  \nI do feel the AZ Center is under appreciated and under utilized.  The restaurants may not be stellar but most of them are good.   \n\nMy favorite part is the more lush park area with the water and the falls adjacent to Sam's Cafe and My Big Fat Greek.  I have seen weddings and parties hosted in this area.   There have been nights where I am restless and can't sleep and I walk over here and sit and listen to the water and zone out while staring at the lights wrapped around the trees through the interior of the park area.    It also makes patio dining at either of these two restaurants quite enjoyable (along with the heaters they provide in the winter and the misters in the summer).
