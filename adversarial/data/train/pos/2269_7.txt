Popped in toward the end of their brunch and it was still pretty crowded, but we managed to snag a table for two by one of their cute little windows.\n\nThe space is great. Chalkboards with doodles and menu items cover the walls and the cute cafe by the entrance has some goodies for sale. The space gets crowded quick but it's a lively atmosphere. In the summer, there's no AC but thank the heavens this is a corner location and the open air windows let in a slight breeze.\n\nOnce seated, our server informed us a lot of the menu items are done for the day since its the end of brunch but the options left sounded just as delightful. I had the mixed salad with chicken and my boyfriend had the Cuban sandwich. Both were SPECTACULAR. Although it was a different take on a classic, this was probably the best Cuban I've ever tried. The pesto mayo made this dish! The mixed salad sounds so simple but it was SO good, the toasted almonds and the chopped chicken gave this salad the kick it didn't even need. I loved how light but tasty the dressing was. I wanted to come back the next day to have the same meal again, even though I don't like visiting the same restaurant twice while on vacation. It was that good.\n\nThis place isn't overrated or as pretentious as it sounds or looks - go check it out!
