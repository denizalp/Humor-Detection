Went by last night for dinner with my son.  I had not been there in YEARS!  \n\nLet's talk about the good stuff first:  \n - the MEAT is magnificent, especially the beef tenderloin.  I did not go there for chicken, sausage or turkey, so I stuck with beef and lamb.   Each variety was done perfectly and spiced just right.   \n - the SERVICE was excellent.  The waitstaff kept our drink glasses filled and regularly offered \"fresh\" plates.   The meat servers were friendly and helpful in explaining the various cuts.   \n\nThe mediocre:\n - the BUFFET seemed tired and less-than-fresh.  Maybe it was because it was a Thursday night.  That's a possible reason but not an excuse.  We were paying $42 per person last night just like someone would on a weekend.   The food bowls were half-full, at best.  The lettuce was wilted.  The sushi tasted FAR too cold, which led us to believe that it had not been fresh that evening.  The vegetables were soft.  The shrimp was rubbery.  Not much in the way of salad condiments, either.   You would think that the owners would load up tons of great, fresh (and relatively inexpensive)  food on the buffet as a way for us to take up space in our stomachs.  The more we eat from the buffet, the less we consume of the expensive meat.  Oh well...\n\nThe poor:\n - the DECOR isn't just dated, it's non-existent.  It feels like a cafeteria with the lights turned down low.  The chairs are institutional.  The tables are bare (but painted, I assume, in some kind of festive Brazilian folk style).  You're unable to get any sense of intimacy.  Nor does it feel \"classy.\"   If they can't afford to go contemporary upscale, then go for Brazilian rustic. \n - the DESSERT was awful.  Just plain awful.   My son ordered a piece of chocolate cake that came as dry and hard as drywall.   The icing had a thin layer of film on it that hinted to us that it'd been in the frig too long.  \n  \n\nUltimately, in spite of the great meat, we were disappointed.   I might have been LESS turned off had we not been charged $42\/person plus the cost of drinks and dessert.  With taxes and tip -- and no alcohol, mind you -- I dropped $120 last night on this dinner.   I don't mind paying that kind of money for dinner for two, but I expect -- and get -- more for it.
