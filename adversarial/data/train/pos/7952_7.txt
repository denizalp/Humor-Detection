Went to Vegas for the first time and on my list of things to do was get my first tattoo. After doing some research I decided on going to Counts Tattoo Company. Dealing with Shane the shop manager was great, he got my ideas for my tattoo and assured me all would be ok. I was set up with Dave Lue as my artist and Dave knocked it out of the park ..I got a very high quality tattoo, and everyone at the shop was great, I couldn't ask for anything more. If you go to Vegas and plan on getting a tattoo, this should be the place to get it!!
