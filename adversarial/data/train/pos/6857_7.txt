Ill be honest.\n\nI wanted breakfast.  But we planned the brunch for noon, so noon it was, and apparently its not a breakfast all day kind of buffet.  That's just too bad I say though because my three mimosas would have tasted much better with a do-it myself omelet or a waffle bar.  They were good regardless, but the delicious bacon wrapped pork, or the fried shrimp just didn't do to my belly what i had wanted to happen.  I wanted magic.  I wanted taste explosions.  I wanted my stomach to thank me personally.  But all that happened was a too full belly, $20 i'll never get back, some wasted food on multiple plates, and some nasty gas.\n\nThree stars for each of the mimosas.
