After a Sunday Yoga sesh with the Yoga Master David V., we met Alison Hakan, owner of She Bakes, a small operation bakery which specializes in gluten free and vegan sweets and snacks.\n\nShe was nice enough to have cookies for us to try, and WOW! I've never tried a gluten-free peanut butter cookie that was this good! With a pastry background from Le Cordon Bleu, and a passion for using the best natural ingredients available, Alison's products are not your typical healthy made, not-so-good tasting cookies. The bag of Gluten-Free Peanut Butter Cookies was gone in seconds!\n\nBummer that there is no storefront(yet) but you can find She Bakes items at Sambalatte in Summerlin. For those of you who are trying to live a healthier lifestyle, or are seeking very tasty gluten-free\/vegan baked goods and sweets, give She Bakes a try. You won't be disappointed!   ALOHA!!!
