Worst service ever. \n\nA few friends and I ordered two pizzas and some bread sticks for delivery and after an hour and a half, still no pizza! We called the restaurant and the staff told us the pizza was on it's way. We waited another 45 minutes to no avail. The pizza had still not arrived. We called the restaurant once again to cancel our order and they decided to mock us by saying they would check the oven and cancel our pizza. Great way to keep customers.
