Well, the phrase: \"it was worse than a root canal\" is about to take on a whole new meaning, thanks to Dr Madder and his wonderful staff.\n\nNo, I'm not masochistic.  I don't even like flossing, because it stings my gums.  These guys (mostly women) are that good.\n\nLet's start with the reception area.  When I walked in the front door, I was immediately greeted by a beaming Tish, who warmly welcomed me in.  She is hot, and has perfect teeth.  Go ahead; try to find a flaw with those beauties.  Tish also has a sick sense of humor.  She proved that by laughing at some of the comedic remarks I penned on my new patient form.\n\nWhen my time had come, Cherie escorted me back to my recliner... the recliner I was destined to spend close to 4 hours in.  Yes, this was no mere mortals visit to the dentist.  This was to be one of the greatest marathon sessions the world had ever known.  And Cherie made the time fly by.  She was attractive, witty, funny, charming, and not afraid to get down and sing to George Michael's version of Last Christmas.  Looks like somebody has a new admirer!\n\nAre you needing a cleaning?  Then Aimie will do the honors; and she rounds out our trio of beauties.  I don't know how she does it, but she makes me feel completely at ease, and she's got some pretty good stories.  Ask about the Starbucks\/Trader Joes incident.  And guess what?  She called to check up and see how I was feeling after my deep cleaning.\n\nThen there was Dr Madder... a handsome young man of GQ'ish stature.  I felt like I was on the set of Melrose Place.  The Dr was skilled in the art of injections.  Had I been as accomplished with a hypodermic, I'd probably be \"chasing the dragon\" today.  I really appreciated how he would tell me what to expect, before doing something.  No Surprises!  That's my motto.\n\nMy root canal was virtually pain free.  It went very smooth, and I couldn't have been happier.  I left with a numb tongue and an unrequited crush.  But I will return, my friends.  I will indeed return... to get my six month cleaning... and my crowns (king me baby).\n\n{04\/29\/08 Update} Sad news, Cherie no longer works here.  :-{
