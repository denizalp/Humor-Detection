Buddy, for ffs, extricate your head from your ass and fix this place up!\n\nHave spent around $75.00 per visit at this location for the past three years based upon the Lobster Tail pastry being excellent and then rounding it out with some dark chocolate mousse cake and maybe some cannoli, even though they sort of suck compared to anything I ever had on the East coast.\n\nSo, picked up four Lobster Tails, a hazlenut Lobster Tail, a dark chocolate mousse cake and a chocolate mousse cheesecake for my wife on 1\/20\/17.  This was gonna be epic!\n\nExcept, the Lobster tails were flat....as in the puff pastry never puffed....nasty, chewy, awful pastry experience.  If this was my pastry shop, whoever ran the product that day would disappear in the desert, or at least be fired, depending upon how passionate the proprietor was about quality product, but hey, what do I care?  I got a \"free\" Carlo's Bakery water bottle because I spent enough......areyoukiddinme?\n\nVery sad, but was informed by the recipients that the dark chocolate mousse cake was still delicious.....in a previous experience, the Lobster Tail was one of the top five pastries I have ever had in life, growing up on the East coast, that is a bold statement, and I own it, but not with this one, it was total crap and expensive.\n\nBuddy?  Come on....wake up and own it or close it up and move on!!!!!
