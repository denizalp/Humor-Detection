This is pretty little golf course! \nI generally prefer a course that doesn't have a million houses surrounding it, but there is some architectural diversity in the homes around Gainey, and the course itself is very appealing.\nI played the Dunes\/Lakes rotation today (Gainey Ranch has 27 holes, which is great from both a variety and pace of play perspective).\nThe course has a nice variety of terrain and is well kept and lush. The Lakes has water in play on several holes, and requires accurate approach shots on a number of holes. The Dunes, while somewhat drier, has its own difficulties to navigate, with a number of dry washes, and desert terrain, as well as a narrowing of the landscape in the driving areas for the big hitters.\nIf you tend to leak your shots (or somewhat more than leak) this will be a difficult course on which to score well. It is hard to start a shot at a house and hope that it slides back to the right and in play!\nThe course is very well maintained and the service is first rate (it is a country club, after all). Beverage carts are plentiful and well stocked, so that adds to the fun!\nThey have a nice patio for a beer after the round, and it's a pleasant 19th hole, to sit and recount the good shots and forget the average after the round. If they would let me walk the course, it would be just about perfect!
