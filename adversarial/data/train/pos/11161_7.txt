This was my first time at this branch of TJX, and what a breath of fresh air!  Usually I shop at Marshall's, because several are close to where I live; I have to travel to get to a TJ's.  But my doctor moved to Warm Springs, so here I was. And this store has every other TJ's beat.  It's big.  It's clean. It's bright. It's well-laid-out, and the check-out line isn't outrageous. \n\nYears ago Marshall's used to be the poor cousin to TJX, but in recent times, they have pretty much the same stuff, with Marshall's winning in the shoe selection.  But T.J. Maxx always had a leg up with the jewelry, which Marshall's never had.  And therein lies the danger.  For me.\n\nI've got too much.  I always swear I will never buy another piece.  \"I'll just look,\" I said to myself....  And there they were, a beautiful pair of earrings, seductive in their uniqueness, surprisingly priced in this era of precious metal inflation, and just the right length.  They called to me:  \"Oh, Sheila G., Sheila G.\"  And I answered the call.\n\nAt my follow-up appointment with the doctor, I swore I wouldn't go into T.J. Maxx.  This time I went to Glazier's, and the pastrami-seasoned Boar's Head Turkey will taste great with my new earrings on.
