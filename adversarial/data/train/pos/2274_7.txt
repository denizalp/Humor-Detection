So I've been coming here every week for the pase 2 years or so\n\nOrder\n#25, 26, & 28 for sandwiches 10\/10\nTom yum seafood 7\/10. Still better at Komol and Kinnaree Thai\nMango slush 10\/10\n\nOver all, this place is great for a quick bite. Have not tried their pho, but will rate soon as I do. Coolest thing here is the bread. Baked fresh, and I believe if you come in the morning they sell the rolls for a dollar for 6 pack. Service is a bit blah, but sandwiches make up for it. They recently expanded their menu adding more Thai food, but nothing compares to the famous Komol restaurant and the new Kinnaree for authentic. Still a great sandwich shop.
