Major fan of Ulta right here, and this Ulta location in pretty Westgate Plaza didn't disappoint.\n\nI'm obsessed with dry shampoo and swear by Sexy Hair's version of the stuff, which is fantastic for simultaneously freshening the hair and adding volume.  The major downside of dry shampoo is that it's not conducive to flying:  dry shampoo is an aerosol powder, and pressure changes associated with flying in an airplane ruin the product the majority of the time.  Thus, if I'm flying somewhere and staying for more than a couple days I hunt down a place to buy Big Sexy Hair Dry Shampoo.  \n\nEnter Ulta.\n\nStopped by this Ulta location while in town a couple weeks ago to score some dry shampoo.  Was interested in a travel size version of the stuff, but an Ulta employee informed me that the only small cans of dry shampoo in the store were Oscar Blandi brand.  Alright, I'm down to try new things.  The employee explained that the Oscar Blandi product specifically for brunettes is great because it doesn't create the fine white film associated with most dry shampoo brands (true) and adds serious volume (not true at all).  I paid $11 for the little can of Oscar Blandi product but in hindsight would gladly have paid $16.95 for the full-size Sexy Hair dry shampoo that I love so dearly.  The Oscar Blandi dry shampoo frankly didn't do its job, and I didn't like its lemon Pledge-like scent.\n\nThough the advice I received regarding the dry shampoo was inaccurate, the service my friend and I received in this nice clean store was overall good and friendly.
