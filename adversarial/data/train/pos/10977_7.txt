Delicious mini donuts out of a food truck? Ah, yes please!\n\nThe line was long but, went very quickly. You have a choice of plain, powdered sugar, and cinnamon sugar. We all went with the cinnamon sugar. They were fresh and hot and melted in your mouth. They were spectacular!\n\nIf you see this truck be sure to follow it to wherever it is going so you can try these tasty little balls of happiness!
