Negative -5 stars if I could! The only thing that made up for the one star is the duck burger and the their infamous salad. Others than that we had a horrible server, we had specifically RSVP'd for my husbands b day and when the server came he seemed as if he was on drugs, he kept acting strange, and when he saw good looking girl he would talk to them the whole night and forget he had other tables. He shook our hands, because he was introducing himself and if I recall that's not proper etiquette especially when your hands are sticky from spilling drinks all night. He also would ignore us when we had to leave urgently. I would highly recommend to spend your money elsewhere the negative reviews don't lie. I RARELY give a negative review, this place definitely deserved it!
