I have a new favorite restaurant and it is named Kabab Palace.  \n\nOk, so I was expecting your typical Middle Eastern fare.  I was pleasantly surprised.  All of the food was outstanding.  The afgani ravioli (aushak) was especially delicious, if I go back I will probably order it as my entree.  The server and everyone else there was so nice and so helpful.  I want to go back and try the buffet but I'm afraid it can't compare to the amazing dinner I had there with friends.  I wish I was closer to this restaurant so I could eat here more often!
