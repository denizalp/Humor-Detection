This airport is HUGE!\n\nMake sure that you take the extra time to check-in because it's easy to get side tracked at their indoor mall on the way up to security. \n\nSecurity line was a bit large but they had lot's of lines open so it moves pretty quickly\n\nMore restaurants once you get passed security, they kept it very clean and neat. No complaints here!
