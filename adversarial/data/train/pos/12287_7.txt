To be honest, I was a little dismayed when I opened their brunch menu and was faced with a list of 'complicated' choices. None of those straight up 'Two eggs with bacon and sausage' fare here, nope.  \n\nI tried to find the simplest thing to order, but everything looked equally elaborate and foreign. I was lost. So I settled on what sounded somewhat familiar, which now that I think of it, I must have once had for breakfast on a plane trip: breakfast burrito.\n\nWhen it arrived shortly after - this huge log of of a thing in the middle of a plate - my suspicion only grew larger. And then... all negative thoughts in my head went silent. The thing tasted fantastic! I couldn't believe it! I think my pupils dilated with excitement with each bite. \n\nI would have given the place five stars if it had not been for the slow-ish service when we got there. I think we sat idle without a menu, without any water, for a good 5 to 10 minutes before a waitress noticed us and signaled, \"I'll be with you in a sec.\" Granted, the place was busy and they seemed understaffed.\n\nEverything else seemed fine though. The decor is hip and feels so 'right at home' with what the St. Henri neighbourhood is becoming. The white and blue landscape painting hanging on their wall is a great pick and very gorgeous. The price is comparable to what you'll be paying at popular brunch places in the Plateau. Definitely will drop by Mariani next time I'm in St. Henri.
