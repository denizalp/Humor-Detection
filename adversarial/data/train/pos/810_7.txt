If I could give this place 0 stars I would. I made an appointment for a consultation a week ago on hair extensions. I specifically asked that it be with someone who knew how to do ethnic hair as I am mixed. I get there and the girl looking at my hair basically had no clue what to recommend for me and referred me to another stylist that wasn't in. So I go to the front desk to rebook a new consultation with the correct person only to call and confirm my appointment and discover it wasn't even booked. To have the nerve to ask me to come back AGAIN after you screwed me over the first two times and wasted my time isn't acceptable. Learn how to listen to your clients needs and requests and book appropriately and accurately. I wonder if they're just typical racist assholes who don't cater to mixed clientele or anything other than your average Scottsdale industry girl which would explain my poor experiences with them. So glad I didn't let anyone in this place touch my hair considering they can't even figure out their appointment book. I would stay far far away from this wannabe high end salon.
