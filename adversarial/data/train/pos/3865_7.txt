We went here with friends and the person taking our order seemed to \"prefer\" our friends over us. They received way better customer service after us with the same employee while we were standing right there. Im not sure if it was because my husband and I were just sharing, but that shouldn't matter. It ruined the experience for us knowing that people get treated very differently there. The employees seemed overworked and too busy to pay attention to customer service. We will not be returning.
