This was probably one of my most disappointing meals during my trip to Montreal. I mean, the price is good for $25\/person but the trade off is quality. \n\nI prevented myself from giving them 1 star due to their exceptional customer service. The servers were really kind and offered to clean our grill multiple times. They brought out orders in a timely manner and always smiled when we had a question. \n\nThe food HOWEVER, is another story. The meat brought out was partially defrosted and some of the meats had brown streaks in them (not fresh). I was happy with the pork belly though. Thankfully, the menu had lots of traditional Korean side dishes and sauces (sesame oil and salt & soybean paste) for me to make yummy lettuce wraps. I ordered the rice cake skewer and only got 4 FROZEN rice cakes slathered in some sort of sauce all stuck together with NO stick. Why call it a skewer then? The fried chicken was quite dry, and the kimbap was very JUICY (crab meat was defrosted and had lots of water in it). \n\nAll in all, the unlimited drinks they offered did little to appease my disappointment in the quality of the food at this restaurant. I will not be returning anytime in the near future.
