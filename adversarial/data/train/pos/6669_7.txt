I have come in here several times over the years now.\nI happened to be the hood, so I thought I would pop in.\nAs always I found things I did not come in for, but then forgot the things that I did come in for.\nIf I would stop rushing around I might stop to think. But, the smell at times in here is a bit much and there is always so much commotion.\nNever mind all that. They do carry a lot of really cool things and all for for a screaming price. So I am happy to come here and buy a little.\nLots of parking in the lot, but always a lot of people trying to get you to give them something in the parking lot as well.\nHey, if I had extra $$ to throw around I wouldn't be coming here.Sorry. But, back to the issuse at hand. Good stuff, cheap price, check it out!
