My husband has been coming here for many years, but hasn't been here in a little over a year for an adjustment. After filling out some updated paperwork he was good to go and able to see the doctor. \n\nThe receptionist was super friendly and the waiting area is nicely decorated and included a tv to watch while you wait. Several customers were coming and going right after 8am, so they must offer early morning appointments to fit your work schedule. \n\nThey are located right off the highway in an easily accesible parking lot behind the Auto Bell. \n\nI cannot review the actual appointment since it was not for me today, but my husband said he feels better already and plans to get back to regular appointments!
