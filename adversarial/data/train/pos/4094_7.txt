Loved the fresh baked items my husband picked up this morning for breakfast. The chocolate croissant was just out of the oven - warm, flakey and delicious with just the right amount of dark chocolate. The organic coffee was tasty (so happy to find a place with good coffee near my house that's not Starbucks).  Can't believe we never knew this little gem was in our neighborhood. Excited to go back and try other goodies!
