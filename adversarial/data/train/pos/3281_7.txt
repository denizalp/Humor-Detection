Looking for a warm plate of HK style pasta the way your mom used to make?  Craving that cup of HK milk tea that you had during your travels in Hong Kong?  Just looking for a bite on the fly, but you don't want to drop more than $15 on a meal?  Well Big Papa George just might be your jam.\n\nThis place is similar to any staple HK cafe you have been to, except the quality is a bit better.  The milk tea is great, and the selection of dishes certainly keeps you coming back for more.  I usually order the spaghetti and the rose sausage pasta in particular.  It's good and fills you up, I mean it's not like eating at Scarpettas in NYC or anything, but what do you expect for under $15.\n\nCome here if you're hungry and don't mind the crowds.  This place is relatively new to the area so it gets packed quick.  Also it closes mad early, at like 6pm or so on weekends (weird I know), so make sure you come for lunch and don't stay for dinner knowmsayin?  \n\nI love it when we eat at Big Pop-pa.
