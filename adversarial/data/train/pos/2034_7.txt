So went to Benny's Burgers for the 1st time just because its right down the street from me and the wife wanted to try it out. \n\nWe both got the pulled pork sandwich, it was kinda greasy but good. The frys were ok and my son liked his burger. \n\nThe DB behind the counter on the other hand acted like he wanted to get my fist down his throat!!! He was dressed like \"The situation\" and had the hair of \"Pauly D\". He is lucky my fam was there or he would have gotten the beating of a life time!! \n\nProb will go in again to try something else on the menu and to see if DB wants to rumble!!! (family not included)
