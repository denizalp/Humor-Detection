Don't come here when they open cause the doctor isn't even here till after 2!!! So you're have to wait 2 or more hours even if you're the first patient that day (me)!!! \n\nUpdate:After two hours of waiting in the room, I walked out to see what was going on. The nurse that checked my vitals in the beginning was shocked that I was still not treated, and told me the doctor probably went to the wrong room. Interesting
