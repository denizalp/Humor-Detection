They have bagels & blandwiches...someone pass the rooster sauce!  Stale, flavorless, dry overpriced  bagels.  Weak \"shmears\" as well...they need to double or triple the portion size of the \"shmear.\"  \n\nWhat really pisses me off is whenever I leave, my clothes reek of the place for the rest of the day...I don't get it?  I actually use to like Einstein Bros years ago, now they are dead to me.
