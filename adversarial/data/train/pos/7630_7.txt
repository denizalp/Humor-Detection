With Ritz-Carlton partnering with Marriott, I would expect the Cosmo to be a classy hotel, but it is anything but that.  Though I have not stayed at the hotel, I have been on the casino floor many times, have seen a concert there, and have eaten at Wicked Spoon, so this review is about the hotel as a casino and not about the rooms. \n\nThe vibe in the hotel is definitely younger and hipper than a lot of other hotels on the Strip. This also means that there is a much higher number drunks to deal with. Nowhere else is this more evident than in the public men's rooms where one constantly watch his step avoid stepping in vomit, urine, or feces that has been kindly placed on the floor and not in the toilet. The bathrooms at the Cosmo are consistently some of the filthiest I encounter in Vegas. I understand that customers can be pigs, but there should be janitors to clean them up. In other hotels, there is almost always someone cleaning the bathrooms, but I cannot recall ever seeing them cleaned at the Cosmo. \n\nChelsea was a decent concert venue, though security had no idea where to send  people. One person would send us in one direction, and then other security would yell at us for being there. There was a lack of training and\/or communication. \n\nThe Wicked Spoon was very disappointing, but you can see my separate review for the details. \n\nI much prefer being next store at City Center.
