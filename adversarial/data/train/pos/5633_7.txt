Brunch at the patio on a sunny Saturday with live music? Yes, please!!! It has been long since my last not-so-good experience at the Herb Box in DC Ranch, I finally decided to give it another chance at this location, well, I'm glad I did. This one definitely gave me a much better experience and a happier day later (maybe because I didn't order any egg-related items like last time? check out the review for the DC ranch location and you'll know what I'm talking about, lol)...\n\nAnyways, we had to wait for about 25 mins for a patio seating which was expected since everyone wants to be out with the sun. Service at this location was great, very attentive, the waitress of ours was just friendly! We both had a salad (Market Sunflower Salad and Coconut Shrimp Salad), both were very flavorful, I'd definitely order it again! :) Looking forward to the next outing at this place!
