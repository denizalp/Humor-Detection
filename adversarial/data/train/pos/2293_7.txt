Alright, best way to describe Dave & Busters is that this a Chuck E Cheese for bigger kids and adults.  In other words a cash burning machine.\n\nUsually when we go we just come for the games when we are near by IKEA.  This is a huge all in one American complex that houses a restaurant, a sports bar, pool hall and of course the arcade section.  We've been to various ones in the States and its pretty consistent with those ones.\n\nNormally we don't get the food and only buy tokens for the arcade.  But today we had Xmas dinner (Yes, you heard me, Xmas dinner, it wasn't my call so don't judge me!) so can comment about the food.\n\nIt's basically pub\/chain food with burgers, pasta and the like and overall not really good.  The steaks were dry, ribs a little hard but the burgers were okay.  The only redeeming feature is that they have arcade combos for about $20 that includes the meal and $10 worth of tokens.  But the real value is if you add $5 you get unlimited arcade (non ticket dispensing games) for the entire day!\n\nThe arcade itself is very good and there's a ton of TVs for sports games.  \n\nAt the end of the day I would say the food is 2 and the venue 4 so in total 3\/5 overall.   Just not my first choice for Xmas dinner:)
