The desserts here are delicious!!! We ordered the frozen hot chocolate and the red velvet sundae! I think I'm obsessed with the red velvet sundae!the reason I'm only giving 4 stars is because the food wasn't up to par. We got the the pulled pork sandwich, portobello mushroom burger and onion rings. Don't get me wrong, it was good... But I just expected better!!! \n\nEnjoy the sweets!!!!\n\nXo, \nNaomi!
