We went there on Friday night with a group. \nFirst 10 people arrived in time.\nThe friends came back to back after and the girl who took the orders started complaining... She couldn't follow the orders. I know it's not easy but pls don't do it front of the customers. \nFirst of all it was a reservation so I didn't really understand why they couldn't put someone there who is ready for this kind of job and pressure also. \nThe girl was nice except when she was making faces...\nAfter the drink which was good (cider and Grand Marnier) I got my Murph burger. It was really disappointing... Thanks god I got with poutine. It was ok. \nI really like Irish pubs, but it's not gonna be my favourite.\nSorry but it's maximum 3* from me...\nI don't think so I'm coming back.
