This buffet is ridiculous! \n\nWe hit dinner in time about 630 where we were pretty much at the beginning of the line. When we looked behind us my eyes lit up because wholly pack was the line packed. It was stretching a distance for sure. Had we come Filipino time and saw the line...I would've about faced. We did have to wait a bit. Itd be too lucky of us if we walked in like king and queen. Since that's not our story, once we were in I was all ready jitterbug in excitement as every true fatass would. It was seriously busy in there! \n\nThey had every culture imagined in there and the options were endless for anyone who is carnivorous, vegeterian, and vegan. It'd be insane to list every item and comment on it, but their cannolis really stood out dessert wise. It was super good! Poke was pretty decent as well. Their desserts are definitely not the cheap dry neighborhood buffet kind. Service was great! It's a buffet so there's that buffet type service, and we didn't feel neglected at all. \n\nTheir buffet price to the ridiculous options is well worthed!!! This has got to be my favorite buffet of all Las Vegas. In fairness, I haven't been to a few of those popular ones on the strip, yet! So, so far..this is it. Like I said price value...it's awesome! Sure beats having to be at the strip.\n\nHighly recommend! Nice vibe and views! Definitely kid and stroller friendly! \n\nDon't forget to wear sweatpants or something gartered! Hahahah.\n\nEnjoy!
