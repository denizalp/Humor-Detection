Yes Circus Circus is kind of a mad dump.  I only go here when I have to, which I did last week because of my presence of Frightdome this month.  Otherwise, I would never come here, although I still do think their steakhouse is pretty good and cheap.\n\nI stayed here many years ago, and remember this place fondly as a kid in the 80's when it was actually a happening place.  It's sad how MGM Resorts let it go to pieces, and I'm not sure why they haven't tried to class it up a little, but I guess they want this property to stay cheap and attract the undesirables, like gangbangers, and mix them up with families going to Adventuredome.  I'm not sure why they don't clean it up and make it more family friendly and safe, maybe that is what security is for.\n\nAnd one more thing about this Casino I hate - the parking.  It is worse than Hooters Casino, which I thought was the worst until I came here.  It's like everyone turns their brain off when they go in the parking structure and drive like idiots.
