Amazing goat cheese french toast!!! Yeah, that's right, they serve french toast with goat cheese inside!! It might sound gross to some but I loved it!!! Fabulous combo of sweet and savory! Genius!!! I give 5 stars for the goat cheese French Toast!!! I almost gave up on trying it when our waitress forgot to bring my order but I'm so glad I didn't!!  Although I was already full from Challah French toast which was dry and not memorable enough, and from just \"A-OK\" avocado omelette, I decided to wait for another 10 minutes because I chose this cafe specifically for this goat cheese french toast!!! I wasn't going to give up easily because not only I spent 30 minutes on Yelp website trying to find a cool  brunch place in this small town where \"non-Sunday brunch\" is a foreign concept (we came on Saturday morning), but also I drove all the way from NJ (6.5 hrs!!) to meet my BFF in Pittsburgh, and the chance of me returning here is very unlikely especially now that my BFF is moving back to the West Coast. My patience paid off!!! However, I can't believe how much I ate in one sitting..... I probably consumed like 2000 kcal!! DOH! \n\nCheck it out if you are in Pittsburgh. It's located in relatively more hip and artsy part of the town, and the cafe itself is cozy and reminds me of cafes in Lower East Side\/East Village. Although the waitress forgot my order, she was nice and polite, and she rushed my order for me. They also serve good cappuccino too!
