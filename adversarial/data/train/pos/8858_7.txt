Decent admirals club. Lots of seating, plenty of electrical outlets, and clean restrooms. A word of warning - if you're going here for breakfast - it's continental only. I've been in some clubs where they have hot breakfast, but this isn't one of those places. Still better than sitting in the terminal for hours.
