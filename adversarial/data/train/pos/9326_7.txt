If you go here and have the Filet Mignon or the Stroganoff, that also has Filet Mignon as the beef, and you don't like it...I'll pay for your meal. The only exception is that I get to punch you in the face as hard as I can. Why? Because you suck. If you don't like this then chances are you don't like bacon or good cheese or success or America and I have a problem with you.
