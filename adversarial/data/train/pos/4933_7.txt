Muscle Maker Grill....Their motto \"Great Food with Your Health in Mind\".  So, let's see what's really going on.  \n\nI had a co-worker rave about this place years ago and at the time; they were just based on the East Coast.  Well, now they're here and I was curious if my bud knew what he was talking about. Their menu consists of wraps, soups, salads, burgers, sandwiches, pastas, protein shakes, and smoothies.  Also on their menu are the total calories for each dish.  \n\nI had two meals.\n\nMeal #1:  Premium Burger, Baked Potato, and an extra Chicken Breast.  There was nothing really special about the baked potato.  It was on the small side.  I thought that the burger was as juicy and as tasty as it gets for a 90% lean burger.  The highlight was the chicken breast. I eat a lot of chicken throughout the week.  In my opinion, Muscle Maker's was one of the best clean chicken breast that I've had in a while.  The meat was thick, plump, and grilled just right. \n\nMeal #2:  Rocky Balboa Wrap.  I only got this because one of the regulars and the employees suggested it.  I'm glad they did.  This wrap had chicken breast, turkey meatballs, cheese, and marinara.  This isn't the cleanest meal on their menu, but perfect if you're trying to up your calories and at the same time get your protein in.  Taste wise, this was pretty good.  \n\n\nThe restaurant is clean and they should be since they're new.  The staff is great and there are a lot of them.  This Muscle Maker is located near the 24 Hour Fitness, which drove a lot of post-work out diners here. So, it can get busy. Overall, I'm a fan will come back.  I have an office just 5 minutes from here and when it's time to pound some protein, it's nice to know that there's a place minutes from me. \n\n\nTIP:\n-They deliver ($2.50 charge)\n-Recommended by HealthyDiningFinder.com\n-Prices are average
