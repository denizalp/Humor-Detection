I'll be frank - this is the only buffet that I've ever been to in Las Vegas so far at the time of this writing, so I don't really have anything to compare it to (*yet*). Speaking to people I know who have more experience with Vegas buffets, the consensus seems to be that Wynn's buffet is not quite regarded as the best one (or even *one of* the best ones) in the city, and the experience seems to generally be one of being underwhelmed.\n\nHaving said that, I consider my experiences here to have been positive, overall. I was pleased with the great variety of food that was available, and the quality (while varying from dish to dish and not always the most mind-blowing) was largely satisfactory. The service was consistently friendly and attentive, and the dining atmosphere was quite pleasant.\n\nThe pricing was $27.99\/person for lunch (before tax\/gratuity) - I should disclose that as I was staying at the Encore for 5 consecutive days, I was completely comped (along with my companion) for my 3 lunches at the Wynn Buffet as part of the on-going promotion when I had booked my stay.\n\nThe line and wait time varied during all 3 visits, as we went during different times of the lunch period. In one case, I recall us getting in after only about 5 minutes. I think the wait time was closer to 20+ minutes the other 2 times.\n\nAll things considered, I'm 100% sure if I'd come back here again on my own dime, but I say give it at least one try if you've never been here.
