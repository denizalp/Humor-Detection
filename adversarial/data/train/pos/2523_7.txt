Chocolate who does not love it?\nI know there are a few folks that do not. I myself only like the Dark Chocolate.\nMy girlfriend likes it all, except truffles are the last on her list. \nI will eat Truffles but, only dark chocolate.\n\nShe loves Godiva and I have to say that I do have a new favorite here and that is the dark Chocolate Pretzels.\nThe service is very nice here. They always give you a sample and if you have their card,They have a lot of surprises for you on each visit.    \n\nSince it is now after Easter there are even a few good deals on marked down Chocolate. Even a good deal on coffee, 3 for $37.00. We do like their coffee.\nLots of parking, it is at the mall.
