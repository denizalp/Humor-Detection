Can't believe that I haven't written a review for this place considering how often I go. Hands down, THE best croissants in the city...there, I said it. They constantly have a new batch in the oven and the place smells divine from afar, like a siren calling me to 'eat more butter.' The people complaining about lack of variety, WTF? You go for the croissants and the Kouing Aman...what else do you need?!? Damn, now I' hungry.
