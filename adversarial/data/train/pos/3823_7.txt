I have been using the Good feet support system for over 10 years and use it all the time when I go running.  I went in to get some more athletic cushion pads as many marathons have taken its toll on the cushion pads that I have.  I saw on Yelp, the deal where you can buy for $50 a voucher that is good for $75 to use in the store or you can redeem on the phone.  \n\nSo I went into the store and showed them my phone with the yelp deal. The salesperson didn't know anything about this promotion and neither did any of the other sales staff as one of them had to call the owner about it.  So after a little bit of fussing about the deal that they didn't know anything about, I finally got my cushion pads. \n\nIt's sad to see that they only have one store in the valley now, but I am happy that they have not closed down completely.
