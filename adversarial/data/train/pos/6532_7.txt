Winner, congratulations you have earned one star. If this review was just for the food I would have given them 4. Guess you don't want to catch them on a bad attitude day. Shame how one experience can lose a customer. Long story short (after a bunch of hassle and attitude) they left an item out of our to go order. Went back and they pretty much called us liars. We have eaten and enjoyed several of their pizzas. Threw the menu away and won't be going back. Fortunately there are lots of pizza restaurants in town that serve pizza without the attitude.
