Conversation with my husband as we're walking from the car into the outlet store:\n\nMe: \"Thanks for bringing me here, they have a pair of shoes that I'd like to....\"\n\nwe open the door and enter.\n\n\"...buy for work\" (unable to hear myself think.)\n\nHusband: \"What?\" \n\nMe: \"Shoes for work\"\n\nHusband: \"Say again?\"\n\nMe: \"Work shoes\"\n\nHusband \"WHAT?!?\" \n\nMe: \"Nevermind\"\n\nWhy in the WORLD is the music so loud in this store?!?  It's a shoe store, not a club!  \n\nAnyway, the first thing I noticed when I walked in was the fact that music was a number of decibels louder than anything I want to hear while shopping.  And the second thing I noticed was how freakin' huge the store was!  Holy shoes!  Aisles and aisles of skechers and all I could think was, \"please turn the music down\" and \"I didn't know Skechers even made this many shoes.\"  \n\nAt the front of the store they have a popcorn maker and workers were prefilling paper bags with popcorn for customers to grab.  Yes, please. \n\nSo I boogied my way to the work section and pick up the shoes I wanted, eating popcorn along the way.  The aisles were very well organized and I found my size without a problem.  I got the shoe for about 20 bucks less than I had seen it for online.  Score! \n\nThen I realized they were having a buy one get one 50% off sale (some of the shoes, including skecher work and their \"dressier\" shoes were not included).  So I decided to walk through aisles and aisles of skechers, surprisingly liking a lot of what I saw.  Decided to get a pair of sneakers as back-ups, you know, just to kick around in, walk the dog to the park in, etc.  My husband found a pair of casual brown shoes that he liked.  Then I saw a pair of outdoor shoes good for short hikes.  Figured I'd grab those too and now I realized we could get another pair at half off so I sent my husband searching for a second pair... loudly.  Because the music was still blasting.  \n\nMe: \"You need another pair because you can get them half off.\"\n\nHusband: \"Huh?\"  \n\nMe: \"Go get another pair\"\n\nYou get the idea. \n\nOh boy.  That moment when a consumer takes a good deal way too far.  Yup, that's me.  I'm that consumer.  So we left with 5 pairs of shoes.  I know.  I have a problem.  \n\nAt the register they told us about their skechers elite program.  Free to join, earn 1 point for every dollar spent and earn $10 for every 100 points.  I went for it and I'm already out on top with my first ten bucks and halfway to my next.  Please.  Don't let me go back.  How many skechers can one girl own?  I now own 3 times the amount of skechers than I ever did in my lifetime.  \n\nAll in all a good shopping trip, and the popcorn made up for the headache that I left with.
