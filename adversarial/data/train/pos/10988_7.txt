I really don't understand all the hoopla about P F Changs. I first visited the location in La Jolla, CA as my business was across the street. I remember how unremarkable they were. I had a hellacious experience there and never set foot in a PFC since .... Until yesterday at Happy Valley.\n\nIt is amazing how things haven't changed - still mediocre food and stupid high prices. A least they keep the dining room so dimly lit you can't see the food they serve.  I can't recommend them unless you prefer to have a few cocktails before dinner is served. At least your taste buds will be numb. \n\nI've had the best elsewhere ...... Save yourself a lot of money and go to the little express fast food joint with the bear - its a whole lot better for the price paid and the quality received then use the money you saved and go to the movies.
