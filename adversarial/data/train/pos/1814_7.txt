Acanac should go out of business. We live in Kitchener and this is the worst experience with customer service I've ever had.\n\nWe joined and they took our credit card information no problem and billed us for the year. What we realized later was that they did not schedule a Rogers representative to visit our home (simply confirm that the modem is connected by cable, send us a welcome package) or send us a modem. \n\nIt's now a week later and 700 dollars later - no internet, no rogers rep and the WORST customer service ever!!! If you want to wait 4 hours to talk to a representative, email back and forth with various representatives (being bounced back and forth) then this is your company. We'll probably go back with Rogers now after this nightmare experience. \n\nBonsoir!
