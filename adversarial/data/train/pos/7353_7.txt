Ghetto is as ghetto does, you know you have  a problem when there has to be at least one parked Port Authority police car parked across the street from the T station when the high school kids get out from school.\n\nThe T-station is a hang out for some of the dirtiest, worse most disrespectful city residents to congregate and cause a disturbance. That probably is not the Port Authority's fault but it's still awfully annoying and a little bit scary. \n\nThe two stars is for the fact that this location has a PNC atm that dispenses $1 dollar bills , yeah!!!
