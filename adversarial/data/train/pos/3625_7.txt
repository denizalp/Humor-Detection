They have an amazing variety and the owner was really helpful and friendly. The quality and freshness varied a bit across the items; however, the pieces that were really fresh were delicious. I will definitely come back and try out some of the other pieces; it seems the cake slices held up better than the smaller individual miniature cakes.
