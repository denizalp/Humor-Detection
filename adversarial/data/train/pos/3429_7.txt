Super disappointed. I was really excited to try this place. \n\nThe enchiladas were super small, and bland. Yes, you can add hot sauce but shouldn't there still be flavor? It literally looks like it came out of a microwaveable meal. I feel bad giving it a review like this but this is my honest opinion. Maybe after some time they'll improve the food and this was just because they're getting use to things but for the quality of food and having to pay ~$8-9 for two small enchiladas with a small portion of rice and beans, this is not worth it. \n\nThe rice looks like it would be seasoned but it was extremely bland. Not enough additional hot sauce can hide this. \n\nI've shown this picture to several people who all agree that it looks like it could be a frozen meal.
