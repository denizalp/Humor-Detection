Well, sometime between last week and now, George was terminated.  So a young lad of 20 named Mitch was assigned to me.  If he had blond hair and an extra 40 lbs, he'd look a whole lot like Dolph Lundgren from Rocky 4.\n\nMitch kept the workout moving quick, and kept it heavy cardio.  I got my money's worth.
