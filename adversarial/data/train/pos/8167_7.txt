I was hoping when I walked up to this place and saw boards in the windows that great things awaited inside. Unfortunately no. This is a bar with board games that are the condition of what you would expect to see at a YMCA summer camp.  Half the pieces gone, just sprawled out all over the place. \n\nIt seems as though the management has tried to divide the bar and the game room, but the game room is so messy and unkept that no one wants to be in there. Also no waitresses in there so you have to get up and go to the bar anyway, so people just sit at the bar with board games. This is fine and all except it makes getting a drink difficult because you are calling to a bartender over a hipster couple engaged in a deep game of Candy Land. \n\nThey do have a cool idea of having old school gaming systems at the high tops surrounding the bar, however we went on a Friday night and despite every table being full, not one person was playing a video game. We couldn't get a table, couldn't get a drink, and just left.  \n\nAll in \"A\" for idea \"F\" for execution.
