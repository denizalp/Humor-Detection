I visited this restaurant on a Saturday morning. I came for their Thelma's special, but I also wanted to order the adobo fried rice omelet. However, the lady wouldn't let me order the Thelma's special a la carte. She was also rude & rushed me even though there was only one customer behind me, and I was the first customer of the day. The food itself was a DISAPPOINTMENT. I usually visit their original location back home in Waipahu, and that location is WAY BETTER than this one even though this one in Henderson is bigger & nicer.\n\nOverall, a very POOR experience. If the cashier lady didn't rush me & was more flexible with the menu, I would have given this place 3 stars. Nevertheless, I'm never coming back to this location (as if they care). I don't recommend this place at all.
