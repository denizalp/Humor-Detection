DUDE, I would TOTALLY go back. The atmosphere of this place is absolutely awesome. You walk in and it feels like a modern, classy lounge. The first thing I noticed was the ridiculous amount of beers they have on tap. As I sat down, I proceeded to count and they had 40 different beers on tap. FORTY. I've NEVER seen that many in my life!! That's raw -- way to go Delux.\n\nDELUX BURGER (the first one on the menu) - Um, YEAH IT HIT THE SPOT. I wasn't brave enough to try the cheese that was on the burger so I swapped it for some melted cheddar. The waitress even suggested I do that if I wasn't bold enough to try this two cheese mix that was supposed to go on the burger. Shrug. \n\nFRENCH FRIES - Kinda tasted like McDonalds...so it was GOOD.\n\nSWEET POTATO FRIES - This is a MUST ORDER.\n\nAnyway, your fries come in a cute small shopping cart w\/ a side of ketchup and I believe what was a chipotle mayo sauce. It was tasty nonetheless and the chipotle mayo sauce tasted magnificent on your burger.\n\nThis place can get somewhat pricey but it was $10 for an orgasmic burger. YUM. Definitely a cute place to go on a casual date.\n\n(Photos uploaded)
