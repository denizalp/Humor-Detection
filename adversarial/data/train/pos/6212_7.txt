It is thursday, march 26, 2009 and I am currently at Tryst sitting on the side with my friend who is a girl, next to the left gogo dance, and it is 1:31am. I have a couple things I want to say that I am noticing at this elite nightclub in the whynn. \n\nSo here the lowdown on attire:\nif you are a muscle head with a tight graphic tee from express men.... You're in.\nIf you have oversized watches, huge rings, a new era hat, supra high top SNEAKERS, you're in.\nIf you're a girl looking to get pounded by sleazy middle aged wealthy men, you're in.\n\nBut you know what, these type of \"people\" have connections.\n\nI feel like i'm back in an 18 and up club serving alcohol with the \"cool fellas\" on the sideline watching the  groups of lionesses doing their thing on the floor. Hm like an elementary garage party hosted by the parents.\n\nYea, i'm hating right now... Because we got in for free as well. Thanks clubzone.com\n\nThe dj is good... The bartenders are nice, well at least mine, melinda?? Tall blonde?? Props for handling a so-called \"elite\" crowd like this.\n\nBTW, i'm a fresh 21yo since February, haven't experienced too many clubs. Probably don't know any better, but I do know when I want to dance, and here at Tryst, sorry, i'll have to be quite buzzed to come back in again for free.\n\nHope this helped.
