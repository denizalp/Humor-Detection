Only auto parts store in town with a '70 Pontiac points set and points condenser in stock. Love their ability to look up parts in the parts books as well as on the computer. They found the exact distributor wire I was looking for and also had that in stock. It's impressive how Charleston Auto Parts always seems to have the part you need on hand, time and time again. \n\nLast night I went to AutoZone and O'Reilly looking for these parts and neither of the counter persons even knew what a points set was - the 22yr. old AutoZone guy had the audacity to say \"I've never heard of a points set and I've been working on classic cars my whole life.\" OK, whatever dude, just find the part...
