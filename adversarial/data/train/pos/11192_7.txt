This location has been remodeled. They have a PINK location too. The employees were so nice and willing to help you. I knew what was on sale and where to find it. The store was busy but it wasn't messy. I do not like messy stores. Keep up the good job. \n\nThe PINK location sells ASU merchandise which is awesome. The employees greeted people at the door and were not pushy with trying to sell you stuff. Plus they checked back with you to see if you were still doing okay.
