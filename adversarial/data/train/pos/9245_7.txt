So I call to make an appointment for my unrluly brows at a Wild Hair for J-Byrd and she is gone, however the receptionist was nice enough to give me her cell phone number. I am not going to call someone's personal cell phone just to get waxed so I went on Yelp to find someone new. I ran across Wax in the City, it was way across town but for good brows nowhere in the valley is too far to drive. So off I went without an appointment, I figured I would just play dumb about calling for an appointment and just assume that it was a walk in type of place. Plus if I came early enough maybe I could be seen without having to wait too long. So I went in at about 11:30 am and asked if anyone was available. I was looking forward to seeing that Evanka chick but beggars can't be choosers & I was a walk-in after all. The receptionist kind of looked at me strangely  when I said I had no appointment (it's always funny how the people who do the least amount of work in an establishment always give you the most attitude). So while she was trying to figure out if I could be seen (no one was even in there) Kelly came out of her room and saved the day, she said she could squeeze me in before her next appt. at 12:00 pm - yay!!! She was very good & quick and I was out of there before her next appt. strolled in. See? No friggin' problem, receptionist lady.
