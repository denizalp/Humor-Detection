Nice rooms, very nice pool, enormous hot tub, and a safe, and convenient location by lots of restaurants, bars, coffee, and shops were the major positives for the San Marcos Crowne Plaza. \n\nThe building itself is older, in need of a little freshening up, and is not designed well which leads to really long walks from the car or lobby.\n\nI am also not a fan of the additional $8 a day 'resort free' that everyone is required to pay in addition to the room rates. It covers parking, wi-fi, and a free bottle of water. I was hoping for gold chips in the water but no luck. \n\nI rarely order room service but did here. We placed our order for breakfast the night before. Our food arrived 45 minutes later then it was supposed to and tasted average at best. I don't recommend their room serves, especially with other nice restaurants around, both on site and in walking distance. \n\nI give them 3 stars as overall, it is a nice hotel.  However, there was nothing outstanding other than the huge ostrich statue in the lobby.
