Stopped in here after refusing to wait for Guadalajara and Gallo blancos wait times on a labor day weekend. We tried this place after passing by it twice. What the hell why not. Got inside and the atmosphere was less than desirable, felt like I was at work in a warehouse with shitty ventilation. Chips and salsa arrived, half chips half crumbs, and the salsa appeared to be a bowl of canned stewed tomatos, which in my mind trying to figure out how to dip this chip into this thick salsa that looks like it's just chunks of tomato. So the entrees come and our waitress as serving us spills hot water off one of the plates on my girl, and doesn't come back with any towel or ice, while my girl believes it was accidental, I think waitress did it on purpose because my girl appears to be a snobby bitch all the time. (She can't help it, it's just the way she comes off)  so while enjoying our entrees, yup I said enjoying, it wasn't all bad food was okay except the enchiladas, the tortillas seemed stale like the plate was made 2 days ago and reheated just for me. The ticker was when were watching the game 2 angry roaches came out of no where fussing and arguing about who was gonna win the game, not bugging any one else while they did their debate (ha I said not bugging any one) my girl whose got a serious disgust and fear of roaches fled the restaurant and waited in the car on this 100+  degree that day. Cashier was curious about the situation and took care of us otherwise after explaining what happened. That would be my last time visiting, wondering what the roaches do while they aren't fighting over sports, probably using huge chunks of tomatos to float on in the thick salsa to keep cool while inside.
