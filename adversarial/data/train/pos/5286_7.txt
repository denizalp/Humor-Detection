Not to be confused with Nuru  -  Nuro Bistro delivers silky smooth Hainan Chicken paired with a trio of house-made sauces which is probably just as good as a Nuru you can find on Spring Mtn -  but don't ask me b\/c never had a true Nuru but I imagine it would be as delectable... \n\nVegas is lucky to now have a pair of stellar Hainan Chicken purist options along with Flock & Fowl.   I'd go to F&F weekly if I could -  if I had to rate it I would rank Nuro slightly behind.   But that's not a bad thing.   This is like a 9.2 Vs. a 9.8-9.9.   Venus to Serena.\n\nIn true Asian form, there is a $1 upcharge for dark meat which has less meat.   We got both but it would be nice to be able to get a combo of white and dark.    The trio of sauces consisted of a sweet dark soy, your traditional ginger scallion, and a SPicy Nuro which was more vinegar base.\n\nService was great, food was probably 15% cheaper than F&F.   I will be a Nuru regular since it's much closer to where I live.   Next time will order the Chicken Soup and wings but based on how the Hainan Chicken is I wouldn't expect anything less than pure delish.   Between 2 people and a toddler, we ordered 3 orders of HN CHicken and some pig ears and we devoured it all - it was so good!
