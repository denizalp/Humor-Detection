So Bill's is old, kind of dingy and there is no short of creepy looking gamblers\/pimps\/hoes roaming around the casino...but I still have a special place in my heart for it. \n\nJust because Bill's isn't the Bellagio or Palms, that does not mean it is not awesome. I kareoke'd my heart out to Blondie, hit up their late night club down below, Drai's, and played roulette until 7am. Nothing says Vegas like walking out of a casino at 7am to go to bed. Amen.
