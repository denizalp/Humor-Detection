***YELP 100 CHALLENGE 90\/100***\n\nWe used to live in the apartments nearby, many moons ago and have seen this particular space cycled into different restaurants. For the past couple of years it's been home to Ross J's. If I had my way, I would come here everyday but alas, we reside in the other side of the valley now.\n\nWe wanted Hawaiian food when we woke up Saturday morning and was debating on either going to their California Hotel location or Henderson, the latter was decided on as we remembered the HI vs UNLV game was this weekend and most likely downtown would be insanely busy. I like coming here better anyway, it's more laidback. \n\nHubby opted for the breakfast fare: Hawaiian fried rice, eggs and Portuguese sausage. I was jonesing for a fix of their Spicy Korean chicken, man was it good! With just the right amount of heat for my liking, so flavorful and moist and the crispy skin just puts it over the top. They have the best Spicy Korean chicken in town imho! Kids shared a Chicken Katsu plate as their portions are so large. Everything was on point! Prices are very affordable, would definitely be willing to pay a couple dollars more for the quality and portions we get. Weekends can get pretty busy and there might be a little wait here and there but believe me, it's WORTH it! Don't forget to grab a bag of their delicious cookies by the register for dessert $5 a bag ;)
