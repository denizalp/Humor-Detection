I have been feeling this way for a while that the Hash House has really gone down hill. We were very surprised to see how empty the place was for a Sunday night during happy hour. They only had one server so they didn't expect more than they had either. \n\nThe food: First of all I was very happy to see we were given a full menu. We could order anything even breakfast. The biscuits with honey butter (free appetizer) shouldn't even be served. They were hard and crumbled hardly warm and definitely not worth eating. Just really pretty to look at. My crab cake sandwich was delicious! His stuffed burger want really what we expected. It's not really a stuffed patty as we were thinking it just a burger with a lot of add-ons. He wasn't that impressed with it. My plate had a small amount of fries where his plate had a good amount. The prices are very reasonable! Definitely a plus.\n\nThe service: we were seated right away. Then giving this while run down on filling out a card and getting a free meal and a free meal for birthdays. The server was nice but either had too much going on or just not very good at multi tasking. He told us he was bringing out biscuits for an appetizer. We got kinda upset waiting for that. Finally he walks by and says the biscuits are coming out soon they are being made hot and fresh. They ended up bringing out the biscuits with the meal. So a fail there. Then it turned out to be a lie. They were far from fresh. When we finished our meal we waited quite a while before seeing our server again and when we did he just brought us our check. We were going to order dessert to go but got over it as soon as he did that. \n\nSo all in all the prices are great three food is good just don't expect too much from the service or expect the meals to be as they were a few years back.
