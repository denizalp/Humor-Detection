Shark bait, hoo ha ha!! \n\nA: We're walking into an aquarium where we can technically be bait. \nJ: Yes, we are...so dangerous!\n\nOk, not really but after a few frozen hot chocolates *wink wink* it can be a scary adventure. Just kidding, maybe. Anyway, as big as this place may seem, I was a bit disappointed that it was a but mediocre and small. Don't get me wrong, it was cool to see all these seafood, I mean sea creatures such as a dragon, piranhas, and of course sharks! It was cool getting see these creatures and learning about the facts, but also to support wildlife. The best part was having the opportunity to touch the sting ray...so cool! Make sure to wash your hands after though, infection control not just for us humans, but for the fish too! I can see why this place seems so big because it's supposed to be like a sunken pirate ship! Argh! It's a great place tourist attraction and a place to feel like a kid! The staff is friendly and know a great deal about sea creatures and wild life!
