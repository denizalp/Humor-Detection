I can think of no reason to give one more penny of my hard-earned money to Mastro's. Our anniversary dinner was supposed to be special - it wasn't.\n\nService was rushed. \nWe were a two top at 5:15 - the waiter had the warmth of a stop sign; his demeanor rushed throughout the visit. An unsolicited 'reminder' about how entrees take 25 minutes upon delivery of our appetizer \"and to order soon' only signaled their wanting the table for another cycle, so we'd better hurry the fuck up!\n\nDrinks are overpriced.\nTwo cocktails came to just under 50 bucks. A glass of wine with dinner was 23.\n\nStop pushing the seafood tower for Christ's sakes! \nWe were two, not twelve. When I bring clients in, it's a consideration. Not a $300 pile of shellfish for two, however. I heard our server offering the damned thing to an eighty year-old couple seated next to us, thinking; \"Now just how - IN THE FUCK - are these two old codgers going to wolf down a hundred pieces of shellfish, pre-meal no less!\"\n\nOysters didn't taste fresh, making me wonder if they use canned oysters and re-use the shells like so many other chain seafood specialty restaurants.\n\n\"Black truffled mushroom sauce\" an optional side for the steak topping, was anything but. It was white in appearance and had no detectable smell or taste of truffles - only high levels of sodium. For fifteen dollars, save your money. I had to scrape it off and loathe a little white pile of salted, shitty 'gravy' throughout the meal.\n\nLobster in their signature mashed potatoes were like bites from a rubber chew toy; overcooked and flavorless. (I think someone finally found the Busy Bee) Potatoes had a film of grease - butter I presume. Someone should have thought to give them a quick stir, like I had to do in order to make them visually pleasant enough to want to take a spoonful. Prior to my doing so, I watched as a small yellow puddle developed at the edge of the dish. \nThis was concerning.\n\nWife's drink was returned twice, both times too strong - overpowering the cucumber in the martini. Bartender must confused her with Amy Winehouse I suspect.\n\nSix ounce filet ordered Pittsburgh style - no detectable char anywhere. \nWife's was ordered medium - nothing even mildly resembling pink.\n\nIf it wasn't for the tasty bread basket and plate of semi-soft butter, the dinner would have been a complete bust. \n\nWe stopped at AJ's on the way home for dessert. \nAfter fooling us on every aspect of the meal, we weren't going to get fooled on another disappointing menu item. We skipped their dessert offerings.\n\nWhen I told my wife this morning how the dinner was less than memorable for such an important anniversary, she disagreed, explaining; \"Negative experiences can be just as memorable as can good ones.\"\nShe's right.\n\nWhen so many things go wrong as quickly as last night, ie; the returned drinks, the small flavorless oysters, the salted 'truffle' sauce, you (as in me) have to decide how many times you're going to send stuff back before it returns with a hidden present from the chef. \nI realize this isn't likely at Mastro's, but I didn't want to be deemed the 'difficult' couple at table 31  and take the chance of pissing off the staff. \n\nSo we stopped sending stuff back after the drinks, took our lumps, and got the fuck outa there asap.\n\nGoodbye Mastro's and good luck.\nYou will never have to endure another of my Yelp rants - unfavorable or otherwise.
