As someone who's worked in this neighborhood since the 90s, I'm happy that we have a coffee spot again, something that's been sorely missing for a while. We used to have one across the street from where Public Works is, but that was years ago. Now that Public Works is here,  City employees can rejoice again because the location near the corner of Water and Basic is walking distance to Henderson City Hall and the Henderson Justice Facility.  What's also great about this cafe is that it's open after work and serves adult beverages for those who want to indulge in a beer (they carry local brands!) or some wine for happy hour without having to travel too far.  The guys who run Public Works are so friendly and the space is modern and spacious.  My favorite drinks are the London Fog and Matcha Honey Lemon Latte plus they carry pastries from MadBatter Bakery.  There are also sandwiches and salads on the menu but I haven't tried those yet. All in all, this is a welcome addition to our neighborhood.
