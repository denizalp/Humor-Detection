Just let me shop and no one gets hurt...\n\nWhen I'm out of town I'm always looking for the tourist spots, obviously, there's a reason they're popular. However, I found this place is not only popular with tourists but it's also popular with the locals.\n\nIf you're looking for tons of food choices...I mean, of course, any foodie would be...then you're in a good spot. If shopping is your thing, they have tons of that too. They have lots of fresh produce and a variety of different food cultures to choose from. I saw a Jamaican restaurant that looked delicious. I wanted to try it but it looked too busy, and I didn't have much time. I also had my eye on a Mexican restaurant and their taco plates. However, being the dessertarian I am, I ended up going to get dessert. I found a churro from Pancho's Bakery which was good! I was really hoping to try more desserts but I needed more time to explore. Unfortunately, I got there late so a lot of places were closing, not leaving me with many options. \n\nKeep in mind parking can be a little bit tough but not impossible. I found a lot for $4 after 6 PM. If you're in town it's definitely worth checking out. If you're a local it's definitely worth checking out! Kensington Market is right next Chinatown so you can head there next! You're welcome! ;-)
