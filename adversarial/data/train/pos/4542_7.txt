Okay, so silly me was in a hurry to get to the office, tried going through the Starbucks line {I know, I know. So. Not. Right. but there is a drive through!} However, the line to get in was INSANE so I quickly Yelped the next nearest coffee shop and this gem came up!! \n\nHoly coffee lovers paradise! I ordered their cold brew with whole milk and some vanilla sweetener and I can honestly say, it was one of the best cold brews that i've ever had! You know you're at a true coffee place when the only sweetener they offer is vanilla and the only creams they have are whole milk and almond milk. Not to mention, it is a cozy atmosphere right in the heart of Old Town Scottsdale. \n\nWhat the heck was I thinking when trying to go to Starbucks?! This place is totally worth the extra few minutes to get out of my car and not be lazy! ;) The only thing is that it is a little pricey! A large cold brew was $4 and some change but like I said, quality is fab and so worth it.
