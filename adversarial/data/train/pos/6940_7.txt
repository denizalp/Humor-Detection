I came here to replace a lost SSN card.  Prior to my visit, I had dowloaded the application from their website and filled it out before I arrived.  That seemed to be my saving grace for a visit that lasted exactly 13 minutes once I got in the door.  But, I did come here on a Tuesday morning at 8:30am, 30 minutes before they opened.  There are two lines here, one for SSN benefits and another one for SSN cards:  make sure you're in the correct line because I was in the wrong one for about ten minutes.  Thankfully the one for cards was shorter.  At exactly 9:00am, the doors opened and those with applications filled out already were directed to windows where clerks were ready to process your paperwork.  The other folks, I assume, had to get info and then fill out their apps because they went to another line.  I went to window 13, a friendly gentleman took my paperwork, processed it expediently, and I was back in my car by 9:15am.  My replacement card will take 7-10 business days to arrive in the mail.  Overall, I was surprised by how easy and painless this was to do.  If I had read Norm K.'s review before I went, it may have been even easier because apparently you can call and make an appointment!  Good info when I need to do this again for a future name change.
