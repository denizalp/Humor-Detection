Always on the lookout for for good grub to enjoy with fitness, we found ourselves at D Pinoy Joint last Saturday for lunch. \n\nWe ordered a number of classic dishes and many were hits and many weren't. Some of the highlights were the fried pork belly and eggplant, corn dessert and the kare kare. The rest was forgettable but I'd be interested to check out the rest of their menu.
