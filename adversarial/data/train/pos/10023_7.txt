I happened upon this place when Groupon had an offer going. I thought it was crazy at first, voluntarily jumping out of a perfectly operation airplane, then I thought it would be cool, just like the guys on Point Break! \n\nWell, not really. First of all, those guys jumped solo. Second of all, I wasn't robbing banks. Third, I landed in Boulder City, not near the beach.\n\nRegardless, the experience was awesome. I walked into that place confident as can be. Then they have you sign the waiver telling you it's your fault if you die, lots of people get injured, lots of people break things, some people die. If you're ok with that, then you're clear. They teach you a really short lesson on how to jump, how to set up your body, how to land, and how to be safe all around. They also have you watch a quick video clip, where they (jokingly?!?) suggest you give your tandem guy a $500 tip for his hard work.\n\nOnce that's all done, they set you up in your jumpsuit and start getting you all harnessed up. Then you meet the guy you're jumping with (tandem jump) and you guys chat for a minute. After that, you board your shiny airplane, get harnessed in some more, and there you go. \n\nFor whatever reason, I was expecting to be on the ledge of the plane and hearing \"3... 2... 1...\" and then falling. I mean, don't we always count down before crazy things like this? Not this time! I remember being on the edge, and then being in the air. That aside, the experience was amazing. Just falling like that was absolutely amazing, and the coolest thing I've ever done. It's such a rush that everything else fails. \n\nIn the spirit of full honesty, I should also disclose that when I landed, I needed a minute. I could not stand up. My legs were gone, and I was WIRED at the same time. It was a strange combo. Still, I would come back and experience this in a heartbeat.
