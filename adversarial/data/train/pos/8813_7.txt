Graffiti has the patio game on lock in the CLE. Really, I LOVE this patio. It's a true hidden gem. By the exterior of this restaurant, you would never guess that a tastefully decorated, twinkling and spacious patio exits in the backyard. Coupled with a large art mural, heaters and exposed bricks, it achieves a modern and cozy vibe.\n\nI stopped by here for drinks and a late dinner with a friend. After perusing the drink menu, I settled on the house made Watermelon Sangria. It hit the spot fully, and had the most refreshing, non-sweet overload quality to it. It's all too easy to have a few glasses...be careful! I could sit on the patio on every breezy night getting lost in that wonderful sangria. For dinner, I ordered the Shepherd's Pie. The lamb was indisputably tasty and tender. I have to agree with some other Yelpers--the portion is a bit small compared to the price tag. The Pie was definitely quite savory, but I wished I could have had a little something to go with it.\n\nRegardless, it was still a nice experience with friendly service and high quality food. Graffiti is perfect for a romantic date night or evening with friends.
