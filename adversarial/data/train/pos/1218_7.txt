Holy beer and vodka. This place is ahhh-mazing. Wall-to-wall of wine, beer, liquor from around the world and across the USA and the state. So many people have told me I needed to stop by; a pool party with BYOB was the perfect reason to make my first stop! I was sad I didn't have enough time to just take my time looking around and ask the employees more questions [I need to order some out-of-state beer!]. \nDuring my first trip I encountered a few sample stands around the store, as well as employees at every turn who looked eager to answer any questions. I also noticed that for a lot of the more national-brand\/well-known liquors, Total Wine carries a variety of sizes. At checkout there are a few tubs of the $1 shots for last-minute preparation. Although the focus is on wine [alcohol that I need to drink\/learn more about], the selection of everything is just crazy varied. Prices are what you'd expect across the board. The checkout gal was helpful and helped me sign up for the rewards program -- something I know I'll definitely take advantage of in the future.
