This is a Super Target and it's way better than the regular Target at Arrowhead. Grocery selection. I like their Archer Farms brand. This one is much cleaner, they have self check out too!\n\nI drive further to visit this Target. Pretty good selection of merchandise and plenty of parking too. The few times I interacted with an employees, they seemed nice and helpful. This one is further, but is worth the drive.
