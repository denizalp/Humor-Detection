Marvelous stuff at Matcha House. I've been here several times with friends and recently I persuaded my son to make the trek out to Henderson to try it.  He had a pal with him and I treated them both to their first experiences with the cheese mousse tea lattes and popcorn chicken, both of which I highly recommend. That popcorn chicken is an inexpensive and addicting snack which everyone can enjoy.  The cheese mousse is quite fabulous with my favorite drink so far being the strawberry mousse with Imperial uji matcha. The menu has several other options which include soft serve and honey toast so there is something for everyone and almost a guarantee that you can try something different each time you visit. But, for me, I love me some cheese mousse and I'll be sticking to that matcha drink for a while.
