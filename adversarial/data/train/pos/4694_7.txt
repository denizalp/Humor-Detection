Food: 4. The steak was good but it really didn't have much flavor to it. I've been there once and I had expected there would be some kind of marinade. It was cooked exactly how I wanted it to be. \n\nService: 2. I know this is a place for old money (the restaurant literally looks like it came out of a Mad Men restaurant scene), but our waiter was insanely snobby. Nose in the air, never smiled... not sure what his deal was. Considering it was Mother's Day I wish he was kinder for her sake.\n\nOn the fence on if I'd go back again-- I've had better steak elsewhere at a better price.
