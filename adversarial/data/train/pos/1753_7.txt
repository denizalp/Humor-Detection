It had been a while since I had a Brazilian.  I only ever really get them for vacations or special occasions.  I was suddenly in the market for getting one as I had not only a special occasion to attend, but also a vacation coming up, each thing a month apart.  I needed to find a place in Vegas that was reputable and the apropos named Box got some high stars from the Yelpers and so it was.\n\nIt had been a long time since I rock and rolled a Brazilian, so I did what I've always known best to do before getting one: pounded back a couple of Ibuprofen and washed them down with a 4 ounce bottle of Cabernet (thank you Barefoot wines for making those deliciously convenient glasses of wine in the 4-pack bottles).  I was nice and relaxed before entering the waxing den which is richly decorated in laid back.  The gal behind the counter offered me some water while I signed my paperwork.  She was also my lovely wax technician (is that what they're called?) whose damn name escapes me right now.  But she was a sweet baby and completely professional and personable.  We chatted about growing up in Vegas particularly about the strip mall where the shop is located (I shared that the now closed Boarders is where I met Anne Rice many moons ago) and the Huntridge Theater when it was the hottest venue to see a show.  She was awesome and being at ease with your wax tech is something everyone needs as you're getting the short curleys ripped from the pink parts.  \n\nI immediately scheduled my next appointment and I plan on taking my sister-in-law, who has never had a wax down there before, for a visit to Box.  I highly recommend Brazilian virgins visit Box.
