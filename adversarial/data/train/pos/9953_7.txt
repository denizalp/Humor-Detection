I am writing this review on behalf of my sister who lives nearby and have frequented them several times (every other weekend or so since June 2016).  She enjoys the food, that's why she ordered from them and eaten with them several times.  Finally though last night (Friday) she called me up and complained about the Asian lady (older) that answered the phone to take her order.  She was leaving work and had no access to a menu and tried ordering from memory.  She was ordering several appetizers and multiple sushi roll for her family of three.   \n\nSister said that the lady was so rude and not helpful at all.  She already ordered several items and just needed help with the sushi portion of remembering.  She asked the lady to name several of the sushi items when the lady basically told her that she doesn't have the time to read the menu to her.  Sister says I only need the sushi side.  The Asian lady kept on cutting her off when she had a question saying she doesn't have time for this and that she's busy. \n\nThis wasn't the first time this has happened.  Sister said she called them once along with her husband and they were both on the Bluetooth speaker in the car when the Asian lady told them that she needed only one of them to speak the order.  How rude is that?  \n\nSister ended up ordering from a sushi place near her work and spent over $60.  She was fed up with this restaurant that she called them up and told the Asian lady that she was rude and has lost a customer.  \n\nI love sushi, but this will be one place that I will not visit.  Food can be great, but service is key and customer appreciation is lacking with this restaurant.
