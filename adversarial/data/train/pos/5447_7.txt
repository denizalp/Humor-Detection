I've always heard that In-N-Out Burger is supposed to be so amazing. If this is amazing, I don't want to know what's bad! I tried the cheeseburger and fries and everything about them left something to be desired. The burger consisted of mainly lettuce...which I would've enjoyed had their been any meat on it. The fries were also bland. I've made a better burger at home...but then again I'm from Texas and burgers don't taste or look like that here. \n\nI wouldn't recommend this place to anyone.
