Freaking loved the entire meal.. spaghetti and meatballs ...simple and perfect. \n\nThe meatball was not a pile of mush like so many other places. The pasta was cooked correctly and there was flavor to the sauce. Weird right?\n\nThe free bread and attentive service made this a great lunch. \n\nPS I think the pasta was like 6 bucks.
