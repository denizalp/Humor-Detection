Today I got this message which is related to the review I wrote about this business. It looks that the owner got one of his friends or he did a new profile with a false name so he can email me with rude comments. Still very childish. One more reason why nobody should go to this business. This is bullying. \n\n\"Hi Eli,\n\nMench M. has sent you a message on Yelp:\n\nOnce a moron, still a moron \n\"E O S\"\n\nMy answer:\n\"I am sorry that you are a Moron and you can not change it.\"
