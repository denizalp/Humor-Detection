I do not know how this place got 3.5 stars. Well I just finished my dinner here and I can say if you are looking for sushi stay far away from this place. My bill came up to around 85 dollars after taxes and I can tell you its the worst sushi place I have ever eaten. \n\nI ordered 5 oysters to start off my meal and it literally as small as a ginger slice. Then came my salmon sashimi which was warm. Finally the sushi, I'll let the photos explain for itself. In the end if was not worth the money. 3.5 stars average is way to generous, I honestly can make better sushi myself, that this! The rice was ROCK SOLID. I havent tried their korean food, but if you want sushi or oysters stay FAR AWAY from this place.
