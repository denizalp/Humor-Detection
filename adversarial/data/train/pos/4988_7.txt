Apparently this is the new kick it spot for college kids.  If you're wondering how a bar can be so appealing, like I did, think of it as Commonwealth-like with cheap drinks in a more centrally located area. \n\nDecided to check it out on a Friday night because my friend won open bar for herself & half off drinks for her friends. The drinks... Blechhh. The bartenders must have heavy hands, the drinks were way too strong to consume. I asked for a Vodka Lemonade and had to toss it in the trash midway. \n\nThere's plenty of space- a patio in the back, loads of booths and tables, dance floor, an area for BP, and 3 bars scattered around. Despite all the space, this place was still packed! It's hard to get around.  And ladies, don't think you can rush to the bathroom when you had too much to drank. There's always a line of ~5 girls, so plan your bathroom trips accordingly. \n\nOne thing I did love was the music selection! They played everything, old and new. Weird that they place that Blue da ba di da ba die song, but it was pretty cool when they played The Outfield's \"Your Love\" and everyone busted out singing, \"and I don't wanna lose your love toniiiiight.\" Who knew college kids could jam to the old school stuff too.
