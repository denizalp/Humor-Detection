We were here for a Whitney Houston tribute show.  Before even entering this dump of a place, we had to wait in a line that moved one foot in one hour.  I am not exaggerating.  The will-call had only two windows open.  After that hour, a suit came down the line and explained that they had a problem with their computer system, which wasn't generating the tickets.\n\nThe theater itself was fairly comfortable, but it apparently was the show promoters' people who were taking tickets and seating us; they had no clue where any of the seats were, and it was like bees swarming in a hive as people were lead literally all around the theater with the ushers trying to find the seats printed on the tickets.  Not that it mattered - the theater was half-full, so everyone moved over and down.\n\nWhile the show was very good, this review is for the theater, and the experience of attending a show here was a trying one.
