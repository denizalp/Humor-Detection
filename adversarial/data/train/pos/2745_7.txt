My adventure to get to Ellis Island was quite memorable. \n\nMy friend and I were on the search for food and wanted steak and eggs. (who doesn't love steak and eggs at 4AM in the morning??) I started yelping stuff and we ended up at Gold Coast. Couldn't even find steak and eggs there! It was a TGIF (major fail and a waste of a taxi ride!) \n\nI yelped again and found Ellis Island so we decided to take another taxi ride over there. This place is right behind Bally's (where we were staying) and definitely walkable. Service was nice and the food was definitely worth the $6.99 (?) we paid for? haha that night is still a little blurry and I can't remember exactly how much we paid. But it was definitely comparable to Bill's steak and eggs (our usual spot). \n\nNow that we know where to go for late night steak and eggs in Vegas we won't have to waste taxi rides driving around looking for one. And the plus side is, they're open 24 hours!!
