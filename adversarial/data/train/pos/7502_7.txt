I find myself here nearly every other week because of the Target\/PetSmart combo conveniently located by my job. I really loathe it. Overdone design, creepy constant music, the fact that the mall's outdoors, terrible parking lot planning....\n\nOh. And it shoots lasers.\n\nSeriously.\n\nLasers! Are you freaking kidding?!? I guess this falls under \"overdone design.\"\n\nI have had surprisingly good experiences at the movie theater here, though. There are a lot of teens, but for some reason they seem to misbehave less at Tempe Marketplace than at Chandler Fashion Square. Maybe I've just been lucky.
