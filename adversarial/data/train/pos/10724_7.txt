Wow! Gastonia really needed a place like this. I remember dining at the same location about two years ago when it was a steak house and was bummed out when it closed. This new recreation\/reincarnation blows away the old one. Same great space but with a very different, more approachable vibe!\n\nOur waiter L.A. did an amazing job taking care of us during a relaxed multi course lunch. He was friendly, and very attentive without smothering you.\n\nVery glad to see local beers on tap - a select few ones, even more by the bottle and a nice wine selection. I'm always ready to enjoy a pint of Triple C 3C IPA.\n\nWe probably ordered way more than we should have but the menu really makes it a difficult decision; there's a lot that sounds goo.\n\nThe 3x Onion Soup and Wedge Salad were the perfect starters for us - that Blue Cheese dressing is heavy, creamy and addictive.\n\nBoth main courses were good sized portions, and in retrospect we woulda, coulda, shoulda split one after the big starters (but I'm glad we didn't). The Braised Ribs were tender, well sauced and served over mashed potatoes. The Crabcake sandwich was the same width as the very large bun and about and inch thick with a decent ratio of crab to filling; I can appreciate that you could have a proportionate bite of everything with each bite. The Remoulade was tasty especially with the zucchini fries, one of their most popular sides.\n\nHad a very nice dining experience here - definitely recommend it. We did drop about $60 on lunch (cough, choke) - but we literally ate our faces off and had a couple beers to boot.
