Love them. It's just suck-y that their location is the mall....... because we all know how the galleria can get. Especially in the summer, with the middle school-ers being dumped off by their parents.\n\nAs soon as I walk in, I am almost taken to a different place. The music, is..... intoxicating. I feel like I am in a Bollywood film with the music, the henna art, and other beautiful things that they sell in the case under the cash register.\n\nI can never remember mine of course, but they do have a \"punch\" card system, where if you buy 5 services, you get the sixth free... A plus.\n\nI have been threading for the last year and a half... I had a bad waxing experience in a Henderson \"salon\" where my eyebrows got thin, and then I broke out from the wax itself... which had never happened before, and my co worker recommended them.\n\nThe feeling is really something that you never get used to. It hurts me more than the birth of my daughter did. But that's just me. haha.
