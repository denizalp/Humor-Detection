Stayed here in Dec. Better half used his charm and scored us a suite (big upgrade from what we booked) with a 20$ bill between ID & credit card. \n\nWe stayed an extra day and had to switch rooms but it was nice as well, with a different view.\n\nStaff was mostly friendly. Limited amount of rude F's at the cab stand but the bell stand gents were knowledgeable and helpful. Rooms were clean with some minor-moderate decor issues and some of the electricity plugs didn't work which was annoying. VIEW = AMAZING!!! Both times around. First was strip view, second suite was High roller view. \n\nWe stayed at the Monte Carlo in July and there was a noticeable advantage to Flamingo : 24 hour food court!!! You don't realize how important this is until it's 4 AM and you need a hamburger and your hotel stopped serving at 1pm or 11pm. Johnny rockets was delicious! (vegas expensive but delicious.) Wanted to go to margaritaville badly but did not make it this time.\n\nCasino had $3 bubble craps and a range of black jack mins... their roulette dealer told my hun that she wasn't responsible for keeping track of the bets... (wut?) So he cashed out asap.\n\nThey have penny hundred-line video poker that treated us well. \n\nBUFFET = COMPLETE CRAP. But you'll eat there anyway.... but trust me, crap. (for reference we have also eaten at the Bellagio's buffet but preferred Ellis Island prime rib.)\n\nThey have a bunch of huge parrots you can take your pic with - amazing! But each time we walked by they were on break ... parrots beautiful though ... and we did get to see the habitat, so that was nice.\n\nTheir tag line is something to the effect of \"the strip was built around the flamingo\" and learning that the Flamingo was the first really enhanced our stay and I was glad we got the chance! \n\n******do NOT check in at the kiosk - it will give you some rando F'd up room with no TV at the very end of a long hallway, far from elevators and ice. Bell's promptly fixed for us.
