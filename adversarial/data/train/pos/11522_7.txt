One of my favorite places to get tasty Thai Food in NE PHX. Normally come here on the weekends and bring the family and kids. Food is always good and the service is quick and friendly. Best of New Times.\n\nInside is both fun and inviting with some really comfortable booths. One is right next to a very cool looking fish tank with a lot of eye catching activity. Those crazy little critters are really flying and bouncing all over the place. The wife has to remind me that they are plastic fish and not to get too excited. Ha!\n\nNice selection of all your Thai restaurant favorites and more. They even have pictures on the menu of several dishes. This is always good when you are wanting to try something new and feel shy.\n\nLike to order my dishes Thai SPICY Hot. The family members just laugh and prefer it more in the Medium range. You can always ask them to bring out more chilies if you want to start off with Mild and work your way up.\n\nSome of our favorites are the Tom Yum (Hot and Sour), Tom Kra Gai (Chicken Coconut Milk) Soups. The Appetizers are all really good as well as any of the Noodle dishes, the different colored Curries, the Spicy Garlic versions, and the many BBQ items.\n\nBring the crew and ask for Thai Spicy if you dare. It is hotter than the 1-5 scale. Located in a small strip mall and easy to drive right past. SIMPLY YUMTACULAR!
