This is a pleasant riverfront park with bike trails.  It is the site for some nice 5 K races which are  desirable because of the relatively flat terrain, rare for Pittsburgh races.  I like the park but it is a bit crowded and the scenery is just OK.  It is not sufficiently isolated from the busy Southside for my taste.
