It's barely been open for 6 months and is super easy to find! (right next to Omnia and the sportsbook)\n\nbut 5 Stars for HAPPY HOUR! It runs from 4:30pm-6:00pm Monday-Friday.\n\nIf you want to sample many of their dishes without paying the premium prices! I suggest stopping by for happy hour. Be wary, it's only in the bar area so if the hosts walks you over to the dining area, just let her know you're there for happy hour and drinks.\n\nThe menu has about a dozen items and it's significantly discounted! Food comes out \"shared\" style but to be honest, the portions are fairly large compared to other \"small plate\" or tapas style places.\n\nWe had the:\n\nFarm Bird Lollipops - Chicken meatballs that are seared on a stick. You get three per order and they serve it over an arugala and bleu cheese salad!\n\nCaesar Salad - MAN as a \"side salad\" this thing was HUGE. Only $6 well worth it.\n\nSpicy Squid - Lightly battered squid in a hot and sour sauce. Pretty tasty, but I wish it was more crispy. \n\nShort Rib - Super moist braised short rib over mashed potatoes. If you're buzzing and need something warm to sober you up, this dish will do the trick. $10 but portion size is fairly decent.\n\nThe cocktails and drinks are also discounted too. Most of them are under $7-$8 (marked down from $12-$16). \n\nService was great. Well worth it! We had all those dishes mentioned and 2 drinks each..came out to about $70. Definitely stop by if you're looking for a good experience!
