I didn't go inside, instead taking advantage of the mini rib fest going on in the parking lot that happens every day in the summer from what I've seen. Going by how great the ribs and fries were, I can imagine the quality of the meat here is second to none. If you need a half a cow, for example, this would be the place to visit. There are semi trucks constantly moving stock into this butcher shop so you know they must be doing everything right to keep this level of business. \n\nBack to the ribs. Old school sauce brought back good memories and the styro container they use could hold a meal big enough to feed a family. I've never seen a a takeout container that big. I opted for the 'small' $5 half rack portion which was two sizable pieces of ribs plus a load of fries to go with it. Wow, that's value! The full rack would be perfect to share with someone. The meat was tender and the sauce was bold and delicious! Fries were good too. See my picture.
