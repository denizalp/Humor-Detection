Oh RuRu's... Meh is as good as it gets. I love your space. Your patio is absolutely killer. But there is as far as my love for you will go. The food is a total let down. Bland, boring, and overpriced. It is so disappointing. I'd love to see you bump up the quality and the flavor of your food. I don't think it is going to happen because you don't need to. Your space is always overflowing with young, hip folks that don't have taste buds. Oh well... I'll take mine elsewhere.
