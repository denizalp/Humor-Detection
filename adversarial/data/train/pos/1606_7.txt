Ahhh... Apollos.... \n\nThe little gay bay down the street... Apollos has evolved over the years... I've had some good times here... and now that their makeover is almost complete ( bathrooms to be renovated soon I understand...SOON I hope! ).. I might be going back more often. \n\nThe surly bartenders have long been replaced and a huge patio constructed... although I no longer smoke, its an enjoyable area. \n\nAlthough its not my first choice of bars, I stop by from time to time to enjoy a \"well made\" (read: strong) cocktail, and catch up with buds. The best nights (my opinion) are Karaoke nites, when the place normally packs with a very diverse crowd. \n\nAside from my issues with the men's bathroom... (only the padlocks were worse) and the overly bright lighting, this bar is getting better! After chatting with the owner ...Its great to know that they are \"in touch\" with their patrons and will quickly address any issues! \n\nI'm really looking forward to the completion of the renovations!
