This is my happy place!  I could get lost for hours there and buy from about every aisle.  I have been coming to Lee Lee's for years for several reasons:  l can find about anything l am looking for that is out of the ordinary, call it then extraordinary!  For instance when l need a jackfruit l find it there, fresh, in brine or in water.   If l want a fresh fish, it's swimming in their aquariums not frozen then defrosted then frozen again.  \nSpice.... The final frontier....  There are so many spices at Lee Lee's from different origins, like the Middle East, various parts of India, Africa, Europe and naturally from China, Japan, Korea and many more regions from our earth.\nThere l find rice, pasta, flour, tofu and kitchenware.  There l will keep on shopping for quality and rarity.
