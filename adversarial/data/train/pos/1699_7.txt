Came for lunch & it was not busy at all!\n\nWhy 2 stars?  There was a hair in my food & unfortunately, you cannot recover from that. \n\nHowever, the service was *incredible*!  Very friendly, attentive, quick, and provided great recommendations.\n\nI ordered the Ocotillo chicken, which is beyond spicy. This was so hot, it was unpalatable (for me).  If you like hot & can handle it - get this, it is very tasty.\n\nFor drinks, I had a lemony Martini like drink, which I think was called something Buddah..?  It was FANTASTIC!  A very nice quality cocktail!\n\nThe outdoor seating is nice and relaxing.  This is a dog friendly establishment, so be prepared for the residual hair.  The bathrooms were clean and stocked.
