OK - Normally I'm a fan and, well, an all around positive person. I can almost always find the silver lining in any situation. \n\nBut today at Edgewater was just out of control. \n\nFirst of all, trash everywhere. And not the normal \"Oh, we live on Lake Erie and it just naturally ends up there since it's sort of a basin\" kind of trash. This was just laziness on the park's part and all around gross. \n\nSecondly, there are four lifeguards on duty literally 25ft from each other. Is there any particular reason why you can't tell the 75 year old man in womens, lacy underwear with a walking stick that his attire is inappropriate? There are kids everywhere and he's stopping them to talk. Seriously? I'm all about freedom of speech, but that's indecent exposure and there were parents freaking out. He seriously looked like a frog standing up. \n\nStep your game up, Edgewater.
