Another lunch delivered to work.  A few pizzas & a couple salads.  I had starved myself by skipping breakfast so I was on those pizzas like a horny dog on your leg.\n\nChicken Carbonara pizza? Interesting.  It tasted pretty good.  Petros Special was a mess and not too impressive on taste.  I skipped the vegetarian.  I'm allergic to meatless pizza.  The salads were alright, but a salad is pretty difficult thing to screw up.  None of the crust on any pizza were in the least bit crispy.\n\nThe delivery guy seemed to have quite the attitude.  Perhaps a smile and some semblance of personality need to be injected into him.  Overall a very average experience.
