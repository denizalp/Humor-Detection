Wolfgang Gartner and Sunday Swim each had their highlights, but I have to say that Sunday Swim took the cake of going the f*8k off. The people in the pool, combined with the splashing to the beat and the music pumping was a pretty awesome visual experience. \n\nHonestly I wasn't so impressed with the interior of XS; it smelled like barf covered up with peachy disinfectant. Yuck!  The lay out was also nothing special.  \n\nWhat made XS is the indoor outdoor feature.  It is just stunning with the shimmering Wynn and Encore towers, and the beautiful pool and \"garden\" areas. Warm nights, beautiful sky, excellent sound system, etc. The gambling poolside was also such a nice touch.  \n\nOnly I noticed on Sunday Swim the clientele wasnt up to par of Saturday.  I am paying out the wazoo at a 5 diamond resort to party; please keep the riff raff out of the club...\n\nPretty cool club over all
