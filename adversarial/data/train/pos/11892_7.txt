This was the very first In-N-Out burger I ever visited.  It was 1992 and I was 12 and new to the West Coast.   We waited in line for over an hour to get that first cheeseburger and fell in love on the spot! This day changed my burger life forever more.\n\nNow to the present...I don't really visit this location often since I no longer live in this part of town.  When I do visit, I am usually pleased with my experience.  The food is consistent with the other In-N-Out locations, the service is the best, and the staff is unbelievably happy.  And yeah, the foo is totally delectable!\n\nI do wish the parking situation was better at this location.  It is always really crowded and it is hard to find a spot.  The parking lot is also usually dirty with trash scattered everywhere.  This probably isn't In-N-Out's fault and more so the shopping center where it is located, but it is still a bit of an eye-sore.  Other locations I visit seem to always have someone out there picking up the parking lot, but I have never seen anyone doing that at this location.  \n\nAlso, I am really not comfortable leaving my car in the parking lot at night.  This neighborhood has just gone down a bit and there seems to be some shady looking people hanging out in the parking lot after dark.  If I am here after dark, I do the drive thru and head out of there ASAP.  \n\nThese last things are the only reasons why this location doesn't get 5 stars from me because I am still in awe of the work of art that is an In-N-Out cheeseburger.  Yum!
