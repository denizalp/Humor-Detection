Another great meal at cheddars! However, this time we also had GREAT service. Michelle was our server and she was awesome! She was such a hard worker and very good at her job. I hope we continue to get Michelle as our waitress when we come here! Again, the food is very consistent and very good! Love the margaritas ( so cheap and good) and the chicken tenders, steak, and Cesar salad are also great. \n\nAlso just an update from my last post. I posted about a waitress and she found me on Yelp and commented on my post! (I didn't approve the comment because she just made excuses). I thought that was soooooo unprofessional! I am not sure if she still works at cheddars but it does seem like they are better off having employees like Michelle anyway:)
