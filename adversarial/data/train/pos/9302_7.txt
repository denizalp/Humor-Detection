Casual, fast, fun Asian fusion lunch spot. Worth the drive over. Customer service is genuine and fun. I think they like working here. Go ahead and ask for recommendations. Here's what I've tried so far:\n\nThai Clam Chowder- Pretty good and plenty of clam chunks. Not too spicy and exactly what I was hoping for. It's like a Thai curry in flavor and also because the potatoes. I do wish they were cooked more. I would eat this with a meal if I was super hungry, but I could be full if I had it with an appetizer. \n\nDragon Breath Fries- Skinny fries tossed in chili oil and a mess of other stuff. Even though they look kinda naked each fry has something on it. I'm sensitive to spicy so I was sweating, but I still really enjoyed them.\n\nChicken Salad Sandwich- The chicken still had the skin on, mmmm. It looked like dark meat too, yay! Whatever it was tossed in was delicious. What a fresh and light sandwich. Plus, dat bun! Love the buns here! Served with furikake chips.\n\nSloppy Joe- This is my favorite thing here so far. Even though the meat already tastes great the hot sauces complement it well. Drippy and full of shredded short rib. Great harmony in this sandwich. Served with furikake chips.\n\nFurikake Chips- Sweet and salty. Check your teeth when you're done for seaweed flakes.\n\nPho Dip- In theory this sandwich is cool. Red meat strips and sprouts in a baguette that you dip in pho broth. But I wish I could pour a ton of hoisin and chili sauce in the pho. I mean, that how I usually eat it so that was missing for me.\n\nShort Rib Red Curry Flatbread- So cheesy. It's drippy and rich. I loved the burnt parts of the crust contrasting with buttery cheese. I couldn't finish it either so share with a friend.\n\nCold Brew Coffee- They use local fresh roasted beans. Smooth and roasty. I love cold brew because it's less acidic. I would come here just for coffee. Drink it black!
