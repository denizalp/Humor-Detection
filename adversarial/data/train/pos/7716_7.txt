This is the coolest and most comprehensive Harley Dealership I've ever been too. \n\nAnd with my father, every new city we go to, we check out the Harley dealership. \n\nThey have a full retro dinner INSIDE the show room. \nOf course, they have a ton of bikes to look at. \nBut they also have the showroom set up as a mall. \nWant boots? \nEnter the boot store. \nHelmets? \nEnter the helmet store front. \nParts? \nAccessories? \nLOTS AND LOTS OF CLOTHES!!!! \n\nMy 9 month old little girl came out of there with a complete Harley wardrobe. My favorite, a pink onsie that says: GRANDPA RIDES A HARLEY. \n\nThis place was just so totally awesome. If you are near Cleveland and you like to ride, this is a must stop.
