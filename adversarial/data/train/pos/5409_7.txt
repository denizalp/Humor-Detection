0. That potential client was not using foul language and your customer service was being rude and not letting your potential client finish her sentence and as you indicated to her that you have your calls recorded without even asking or informing your client that all calls are recorded.  \n 0. We do respect and understand that emergency situation arise, trust me I'm in the medical field and we see it all the time.  \n 0. I'm not trying to tell you how to run your business but knowing that you have an employee calling off and knowing that person has an appointment scheduled, all we are asking is a courtesy call.  We waited and waited only to find out that you guys weren't showing up until we your client made the initiative to call your company.  You guys should value our time as much as we value your time by giving your potential client a courtesy call.  She had to take the time off because you guys \"confirmed\" that you will be there at a specific time which she was there and waited.  Again poor business on your end.
