After supper one night, a buddy and I ran out to the convenience store on Delaware for some ice cream, when I remembered just across the street beside Sardinha and Bloorcourt Cafe was a brand new little bakery.\n\nI'd wanted to try the ice cream for some time, but I just happened to be in my pajama bottoms and thought I'd be ridiculed as per the note below about pretentious staff.  But it was one of those nights where I was doing instead of thinking.\n\nSo we crossed the street and made haste to the ice cream shoppe that will be a new destination for my neighbourhood from here on out.  Bakerybots did not laugh or seem overly snooty as I walked in with blue checkered pants and a Raptors jersey.  No, as a matter of fact I walked right up and asked, what would you recommend and the marshmallow ice cream was served up sandwiched between a peanut butter cookie!\n\nNot only that, he charged us less because it was our first time there!  \n\nWe went on charming little wood chairs outside the store and dove into the ice cream sandwiches - which were heaven.  EFFING HEAVEN PEOPLE!  Like, Angels dancing the waltz on your tongue awesome!  Best ice cream I've ever had! \n\nNeedless to say I'll be heading back to Bakerybots Baking very soon!\n\nThe moral of this story, be awesome and awesome things happen in return.  EFFING HEAVEN PEOPLE!
