Happy Hour Daily 3-6pm \n\nWe came in for Happy Hour on Fat Tuesday.  They were packed but we managed to squeeze in at the bar.  The normal HH drinks are $5 beer, $5 wine, $5 shots and $6 cocktails.  We ordered two of their Fat Tuesday cocktail specials Bayou Punch and Big Easy Breeze.  Drinks were delicious.  I could have drank them all night.  We also tried their snack size bbq chicken wings, bbq nachos and buttermilk biscuits.  The wings were my favorite they had a great smoked flavor but everything we picked was good.  The snack sizes are pretty small so if you are in a group or have a big appetite opt for the larger size or select several of the snack options.  Food and service was a bit slow but it was understandable since they were so busy.
