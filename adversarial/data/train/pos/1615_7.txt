By the time we decided to do a cookout and make a list of things we needed to buy when we were at West Side Market, all of the bakery stalls were out of hamburger buns. \n\nThankfully, Dave's is just down the street (and in route towards my friends' house) so we popped in for some last minute items. When we reached the bakery section, we found they were too out of rolls! I popped my head around the bakery case and noticed they had some freshly baked rolls sitting on a tray. All we had to do was ask and they bagged them up for us. Sweet!\n\nWe also picked up some semi-soft cheeses and crackers, (yes, more cheese) to snack on while we prepared dinner. We bought a spreadable gorgonzola and a 4-pepper chevre which were both awesome. The gorgonzola was my favorite of the two and I could have eaten the whole container by myself.\n\nYay for carbs and cheese.
