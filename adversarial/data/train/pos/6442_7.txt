Came here for lunch and decided on having the battered fish sandwich with french fries.  My sandwich came out and it had three layers of crispy fish!! Whoa!! The fries... Yuck.  Soggy and flavorless.   I removed two layers of fish and thoroughly enjoyed the sandwich.  I recommend trying the fish sandwich it's good! If you don't have a big appetite, I suggest you tell the waitress you don't need a triple layer of fish.  This goes for all sandwiches and burgers.  Apparently, Zipps gives you double or triple layers of meat on the burgers and sandwiches unless you request otherwise.
