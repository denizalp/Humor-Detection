This rating could be anywhere between a 1 and a 4, and I will explain why, later.  \"Secret Pizza\" was all I was hearing about ever since I booked my room at the Cosmopolitan.  I am a pizza fanatic, and was excited to try this place out to see if it was \"all hype\" or \"legit\".  \n\nMy wife wanted a little midnight snack, so I walked down here to get her a couple of slices.  When I arrived, there were maybe 15 people in front of me.  The line was moving along though, so it didn't take too long to get up front.  I arrived at the counter and went with 2 slices of veggie (these were the only 2 slices of veggie sitting out, and they did look a little bit old....this will come into play later).  $13.00 later, I had my slices and was on my way back to the room.  About that....if you ask them to take it \"to go\" they will put another plate on top of your slices, wrap it up, and put it in a bag for you to carry while keeping the pizza still warm. \n\nI got back to the room and my wife started to eat the slices.  I was pretty full from earlier in the day (once again, this will come into play later), so about halfway done with her first slice, I ate the other half, and she started in on the 2nd slice.  The crust was great!  It had a nice crisp crunch, and a good chew to it.  The cheese and toppings felt kind of \"greasy\" though (once again, this will come into play later).  I ate my slice, but didn't feel too great afterwards. \n\nAround 20 minutes later, we went to bed.  I was laying there in bed and could not fall asleep.  I was hot, my stomach was growling and I didn't feel good at all.  About an hour after I had laid down, I had to rush up and head to the bathroom.  Barfed up all of that pizza.  It tasted really sour coming up, too.  As soon as I was done puking, I felt 100 times better and went back to bed.\n\nAbout the \"incident\"..................\n\n1.  I was pretty full to begin with already, and probably shouldn't have ate that piece of pizza.  Did it put me over the top?  \n2.  I had smoked a pretty strong Cuban cigar about 30 minutes before I went down to get the pizza.  Was it too much nicotine that made me feel woozy?\n3.  I said earlier that the slices looked like they had been sitting out for a bit, and they were the only veggie slices in the case.  When I was eating them, they felt \"greasy\".  Could these slices have been sitting out for hours? Did I choose the wrong slice?  \n\nSo bringing into account those 3 things, it could have been a perfect storm of the combo of factors coming into play, or it could have just been bad pizza.  My stomach is pretty strong, but if something doesn't sit right with me, I know almost immediately (within 30 minutes or so).  The fact that it tasted horribly sour when it was coming back up, leads me to believe that the pizza was the overwhelming factor of my stomach issues.\n\nWould I try them again?  Um...maybe?  A little too pricey for a few average size slices (I mean, it IS Vegas, but still......), and factor in the bad memory of throwing up within an hour after eating here, that puts me at a crossroad.  Try it again, get a \"good\" slice and have some of the best pizza around?  Or steer clear, save some money and avoid any possible chance of barfing?  Tough call...........
