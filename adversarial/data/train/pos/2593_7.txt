Original price is a little much, but luckily I got a good deal on the City Room and then got upgraded to the Terrance One-Bedroom.\n\nThe Terrance has a queen pull-out couch and also a king bed which faces the bathtub and shower for some added fun. A wonderful balcony is included with a gorgeous view of the city (we were on the 47th floor). There is a microwave but no fridge, just a minibar. In the weight-sensored snack area, you can find binoculars... I find this humorous because from our balcony you can see into the rooms of Aria.\n\nService was excellent and you can save a lot of walking by staying in the same hotel as Wicked Spoon and Marquee.
