I feel like I need to give an updated review as it has changed and is going through some heavy renovation.  We stayed here and were given an upgraded room in one of their newly renovated floors.  Whoa, interesting upgrades!\n\nThe bathroom is spacious.  No longer beige and ugly with their out-dated shower\/tubs and towels smelling of burnt popcorn, now they have a large roomy shower with red tiling.  The sinks are modern but I didn't like them.  The water pooled and cleaning them must suck for housekeeping.  The beds were soft but pretty low on the ground.  There's no conventional desk for your laptop but a long couch by the window with a standing table serves to remedy this problem.  Other than that, those are all your major furniture bits.  The WiFi is TERRIBLE! In this day and age, that's unacceptable.  I was pretty much using data in my room.  Um, no, I don't want that.  Give your guest a password safe network like all the other hotels.\n\nThere are no dining options besides their food court in the hotel at the moment due to construction but they're a short walk from The Park and is still accessible to Aria.  These new renovations have potential though.  I can't wait to see how this place ends up looking now that the T-Mobile Arena is next door and they house the Park Theater.\n\nThey have some low table minimums so that's always a plus if you don't want to break the bank. Cocktail waitresses are always walking around.\n\nMonte Carlo is still a great central location on The Strip.  Everything is within walking distance and if you're too lazy to walk, take the tram!
