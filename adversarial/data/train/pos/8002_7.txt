I'm not one to write a review, but, it seemed necessary for what happened to my sister today at the Mermaids casino. My sister is muslim and wears a hijab on her head. She wasn't in the casino for more than a minute when she was told to \"take this off\" while making a circle with his finger around his face. She said no, that it is a part of her religion, and he persisted by yelling \"take it off or I will throw you out.\" She said no, and he grabbed her, picked her up off the ground and carried her outside forcefully. We went inside to talk to the manager, but he insisted that they politely asked her just to take her hood off. These people are racist pieces of sh*t.
