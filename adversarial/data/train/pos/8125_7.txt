Over rated. Pittsburgh? Your idea of what is classy and worth the money? Jaded and skewed you are.\n\nIn a nutshell, a place with ok food and butter served in individual plastic containers? Like a Denny's? Needs to have an attitude adjustment.\n\nThe high end wines? Cakebread? Overpriced. The corking fee is ridiculous.\n\nThe big white room? Feels like your eating in a cafeteria and the flatware and plates have the same feel.\n\nNo matter where you are you can hear the dishwashers banging plates.\n\nThis is a three star review only because my swordfish was really pretty good.\n\nMy martini? Had lame olives.\n\nWhen we finished eating no one offered desert. Wait, let's make this two stars.\n\nThe guy sitting next to us who had a fake tan and an orange shirt to match his skin? Got better treatment.\n\nI have eaten at the best places on this planet, this isn't one of them.
