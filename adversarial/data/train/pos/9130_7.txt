Capriotti's Sandwich Shop has always and will always be the legend of the best sandwiches! I have been coming here for over a decade now dating back to when my family decided to move out to Las Vegas. This location was on my radar being that I was on a stay-cation across the street at the Hard Rock Hotel & Casino. \n\nOne night my friends and I were hungry after so major gambling and drinking so we decided to eat something outside of the choices that the hotel had to offer for us. Of course I was left with the duty to find us all something to eat so what did I do? You got it.. pulled my phone out and used my most trusted resource.. YELP!\n\nWhen we arrived on a late Saturday night to our surprise there really wasn't much of a wait! Score! My taste buds were pushing towards an old fashion Philly Cheesteak so I went exactly with that. Everything on it you know grilled onions, peppers, mayo the usual. I knew I wasn't going to be able to finish the monster size 14inch sub so I took it a notch down to the 12inch. One thing I've always appreciated was the decent pricing that they offer on all of the sandwiches! While waiting on my sandwich I held a convo with the cashier who was super friendly and really provided great customer service. \n\nListen, when you couple great customer service along with great food.. that's a 5-star type of visit! Subway what?! Nah it's all about Capriotti's Sandwich Shop!
