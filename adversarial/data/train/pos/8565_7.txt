This Homeowners Association is run by a bunch of annoying idiots!!  My wife and I own a house in Las Vegas through Rhodes Ranch and we have decided to sell it soon and Rhodes Ranch is one of the reasons why.  They are on your every move and will attempt to fine you $50 at every possible chance even if you do not breathe correctly according to these losers.  Other examples would also include palm trees not growing correctly, garbage bins and recycle bins being left outside by your garage door, and of course paying their crappy monthly fees in the process!!  It's always a great feeling to take away the power from a piece of crap company like this one (Rhodes Ranch).  This Homeowners Association can go choke and fall off the face of this planet and take their rules and their policies and shove them!!  They won't be able to harass us any longer with their worthless garbage.  We are selling our house and leaving Rhodes Ranch in the dust where they belong.  If you are interested in buying or renting in Las Vegas, then stay away from Rhodes Ranch.  There are plenty of other nice areas to go to in Las Vegas.  SO LONG SUCKERS!!!!
