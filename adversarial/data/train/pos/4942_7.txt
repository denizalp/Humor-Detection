Go for the drinking atmosphere, not the food!\n\nGreat neighborhood drinking spot. Big porch with many TV's and corn hole.  I don't think I've been inside with the exception of using the restroom.\n\nWednesday night Trivia at 8 pm is always a good time. Great beer specials (all draughts $3) and burgers are half priced, though, I don't think they are that great.\n\nParking is usually a pain, but you can get away with parking across the street.\n\nAgain, this is a fun place to grab a drink with friends, but I wouldn't expect a delicious meal.
