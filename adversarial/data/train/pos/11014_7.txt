After debating it for a few weeks, I sent in an email to their customer service rep to complain about Lillie's Noodle House. Because Grotto Ristorante had remedied their service and went out of their way to do so, I grew more and more angry at the pathetic experience at Lillie's. The only way I could get in touch with Lillie's was to email the hotel (big surprise, a shitty excuse for a restaurant has no way of getting in touch with them). I emailed them with a copy of my Yelp! review about two weeks ago and a few extra words of disappointment and have yet to receive anything.\n\nWay to take care of things Golden Nugget!!!
