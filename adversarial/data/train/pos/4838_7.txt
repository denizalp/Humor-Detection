I accidentally used these guys because I thought they were the company I had dealt with.. similar names. \n\nThis review is based on thinking I was using the same company, but was using this one instead..\n\n...However the past couple times this company seemed to contract their drivers.  This guy who looks like he just got done doing crack, showed up with a helper (who looked the same).  When I asked if they could add a couple items that weren't on the original list, they looked as if they were about to cry.. seriously?  I hate moving like the next person, but if this is your job, try not to whine about it.\n\nSo they got all the stuff packed up, moved it and seem to take forever to get to the new place.  I asked them to hook up the bed and entertainment center and when I got there, they were gone, and guess what wasnt done.. the bed and entertainment center.\n\nWould I use them again? Oh hell no.
