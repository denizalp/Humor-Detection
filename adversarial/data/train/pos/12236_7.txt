Okay, this review is long overdue.\nWhy?\nBecause Bumpy's has long been my favourite coffee shop in all of Calgary!\n\nThere is SO much I love about Bumpy's. Too much! This review could go on for days!\nBut let me sum up ...\n\nAll around, Bumpy's is the undisputed king (or queen) of all coffee shops in my book.\n-The interior is so fun, colourful and adorably kitschy.\n-The food is delicious and comforting\n-The staff is friendly, funny and helpful (not at ALL snobs, like you may experience in SOME OTHER coffee shops in town)\n-The espresso ... oh the espresso ... maybe not THE best in town, but certainly tied, or up there with the best, and oh so unique ... an almost \"toasty\" quality to it!\n\nBumpy's is so great. \nWhile I am not OFTEN in the Beltline, any time I can find an excuse to visit Bumpy's, I am more than happy to comply. I love it.
