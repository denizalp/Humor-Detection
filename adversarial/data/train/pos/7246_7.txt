With the weather heating up in Vegas, I figured it would be a good idea to get the air conditioning tuned up. I had replaced the filter myself recently and thought it would be necessary to have the air ducts cleaned. I also knew that the foam insulation on the cooling pipes needed replacement.\n     I  set up my appointment a week in advance over the phone. When the time came the technician arrived within minutes of calling. He was very polite and answered my questions. He told me the duct cleaning was not needed. The quote for the tune up was on special $39. Included was the pipe insulation replacement. At the end of the work the price quoted was the price charged. That's honesty no up selling or overcharging.\n      Now my air conditioner unit is cooling the house down faster. I had called another company to get a quote before calling Air Supply. These other folks wanted $220. I am definitely calling Air Supply again. My technician told me to save my invoice in case I have any home warranty issues in the future. He also gave me a business card. Very professional service all the way around.
