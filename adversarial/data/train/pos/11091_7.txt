Reflexology is not for everyone. \n\nWith that said, I have enjoyed the services here once and I intend to do it again. My feet take a beating on a regular basis, and I don't know how to deal with it unless someone really get into them. For $30 bucks your therapist (and I use this word very loosely) stretch, pull and squeeze both arms, legs and more (no not that).. It can be uncomfortable at times due to pressure, but if it only feels good - then it's it only for relaxing, not for benefit. \n\nThe negative reviews usually are people that didn't know what they were getting themselves into, and for that no blame can be put on the establishment and only on the patron that does no research. \n\nI felt at ease the whole time in here, and it was quiet and relaxing. My legs and feet were sore when i walked in, and felt so great when I left. High returning-factor.
