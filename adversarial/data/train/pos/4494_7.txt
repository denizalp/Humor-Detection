Cheap and good.  Their sushi is decent but I would stick to the cooked rolls.  I remember we got 6 rolls for take out and bill came out to $21 including tax.  The California roll was like $2.95.  You can't even get supermarket sushi for that cheap.\n\nBut their BBQ is by far the best.  So far I've had the chicken.  It's inexpensive and so flavorful.  I love the male server with the flower apron.  He seems to let the dirty dishes pile up at the tables, even when you push them to the edge.  He also can't grasp the concept of carrying more than two plates at a time.  He'll make a million trips just to deliver a few dishes.  But he cracks me up every time.  His floral apron makes me smile.
