On a recent holiday in Chandler, I was fortunate enough to sample Whataburger's bacon and egg \"taquitos\" for breakfast, which seem more like burritos where I'm from but whatever. I appreciate the server bringing the condiment tray to the table. Make sure to ask for some salsa, which they shrewdly keep hidden under the counter. That's some good stuff, man!
