Over all, I am disappointed in our evening. We went on a Friday about 5pm, or 5:30.  We parked across the street at a lot for $10. We waited just a few minutes to be seated.  We had to share a booth-like table with another couple, which means they had to get up to let us in.  I don't mind sharing a table, but not being able to get up without disturbing strangers was ackward.  We ordered a pretzel with beer cheese, and two beers.  The beers were great, thoroughly enjoyed them. The pretzel however had no flavor.  We both ordered the grilled chicken with potato salad. I expected the hot potato salad but that is not what came with the chicken.  This potato salad was ice cold, too cold to eat.  Even after it warmed up a bit, I didn't like it. Potato was the only flavor it had. The chicken itself was good. \n\nThey had two accordian players performing. They were good but you could barely hear them.  \n\nI've been to the Pittsburgh Hofbr√§uhaus many times and I really expected a similar experience, but unfortunately that was not the case here in Cleveland.
