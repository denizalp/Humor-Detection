We got delivery from our local Indian restaurant Kothur for the first time. Tucked in  and camouflaged next to the Panasonic theatre, we had never really given it a shot before. It's easy to miss when the eyes are drawn to the classic and blinding Mirvish light-and-poster display. I was excited and hopeful that we'd have another great restaurant in our neighbourhood. Our order:\n\n1. Aloo Gobi (Spicy curried potatoes)\n2. Veggie Kurma (Cauliflower in coconut gravy)\n3. Veg Paneer (Giant cheese cubes in spinach sauce)\n4. Garlic Naan\n\nThey were all delicious. The paneer cubes were perfectly shaped and would not have looked out of place in any cube-based films:\n\nCube\nCube 2: Hypercube\nCube Zero\nHellraiser\nStar Trek: First Contact\nAnaconda\n\nThe Aloo Gobi was as good as any I've had at Amaya (and 2 dollars cheaper) and my first experience with Kurma was postive - it was the only dish there was 'naan' leftover.\n\nSpeaking of, my only complaint was that the two orders of naan could have yielded more. We definitely ran out of bread before we ran out of dishes. Thankfully we had supplemented our meal with some extra pita, and weren't hung out to dry, having to drink the remaining sauce out of takeout containers like common vagrants...I would suggest getting one order of naan per person at a minimum. Otherwise, I had a great delivery experience with Kothur, and look forward to giving them a try in person.
