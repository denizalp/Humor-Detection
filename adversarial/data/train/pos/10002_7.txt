This is the beginning of a beautiful relationship. I had the pleasure of visiting St. Francis with fellow Yelpita, Teresa F. We were searching for a place to eat after discovering that the Parlor was closed on Sundays. What a lucky find when we checked in on St. Francis! \nI was immediately struck by the fantastic \"open air\" design of the restaurant. We were waited on by a very friendly, knowledgeable server who did not hesitate when asked about their offerings and daily specials. \nWe decided to start with the Baked goat cheese which came with tomato, walnut herb pesto and toasted. It was so tasty! It could easily fill up a person! I had to hold back on devouring the app so I could still have room for the main event! \nFor the main dish I chose the evening's fish special which was halibut with vegetables. I was so glad I went with the fish. It was so good. It was juicy and tender, with a flavorful pan seared crust. The vegetables that came with it weren't just an afterthought. In this case I had a green mixture that was fresh and complimented the fish perfectly. I was very impressed by my meal! \nWhile St. Francis is a tad on the pricier end, it is affordable, accessible cuisine. I really look forward to my next visit. The food was fresh and flavorful. The staff was friendly and knowledgeable. I'd pray to that Saint!
