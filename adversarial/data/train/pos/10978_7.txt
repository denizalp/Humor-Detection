This place was awful and a horrid waste of my money. I wish that I'd called a cab, paid them to take me anywhere else, and paid whatever the cost was when I got there for any other food. I shouldn't have been lazy. I shouldn't have thought \"Hey, I'll just drop into the hotel restaurant for a quick bite before turning it for the night. That will be fine.\" I was wrong to think that. My wallet and my taste buds still have not forgiven me. \n\nI went simple. What's something that's hard to mess up? I ordered a burger. It actually sounded pretty good too. Some kind of house-made Jack Daniel's barbecue sauce on a burger, topped with onion rings and cheese. Side of fries. I've been down this road. What could go wrong? Everything. It was awful. Please use the image I've posted as a reference. The burger was way overcooked. The cheese was not even melted. It was like they put cold singles on top of an already cooled down burger and they just sat there, perfectly geometric. The \"onion rings\" amounted to a single \"I totally came out of a frozen bag\" pathetic onion ring that didn't even look appetizing or add anything to the burger because of how unsubstantial it was. The house-made Jack-Daniel's barbecue sauce that was championed on the menu as the flagship of this masterpiece? Almost non-existent! Where is the barbecue sauce?! There was a dusting at best on top of the aformentioned abysmal onion ring! It was as if the onion ring accidentally came into contact with a dab of some barbecue sauce and the frantic cook wiped as much off as they could before sending this monstrosity out into the world. \n\nAnd the fries were disgusting. I didn't even finish the first one I tasted. Soggy. Revived frozen food that was bad even before it was frozen. Awful.\n\nThis was one of the worst meals I have ever had the unfortunate luck of paying for. Don't go here. Go anywhere else. McDonald's could be a James Beard Award winner, comparatively.
