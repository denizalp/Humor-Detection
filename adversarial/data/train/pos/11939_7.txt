I went here on a Saturday night for a birthday. The party I was with (the people) were great and I had a good time with them but the place itself was sort of a disaster. First, they can't decide what they are - restaurant, lounge or club and it's weird\nDuring dinner, the music was blasting - making it almost impossible to talk to people at the table (not sure why the music is so loud since noone is dancing during dinner - there isn't any space) then around 11:30, it turns into a club - you know this because the music becomes much louder and they start getting rid of chairs, but not tables, so you get to dance around the tables, which they keep for bottle service (this is very weird to me) and they just start letting in tons of people... All to dance around tables... They also don't do a great job with the bottle service - there were no lemon or line wedges, after the place turned into a \"club\", our waitress\/ shot girl was nowhere to be found and we ran out of glasses. Also, she would take away half finished drinks - great way to make everyone drink more and waste more alcohol! \nThe doors to the women's stalls are also a bit transparent so you can see the person in there which is super weird - can they not afford opaque doors?\nThe food was not good - soggy pizza, it took almost 2 hours to get entrees (they had some big parties and were running low on food or something) - when the food came, the portions were tiny and uneven - 1 guy got half a shrimp with his salmon, I got 2 mini potatoes cut in half with my steak and 1 piece of a leek, another person got asparagus with her steak (no one else did)... Clearly the kitchen doesn't really know what they are doing \nThey're just trying to offer everything and are failing at it - wanna be a club? Be a club! Wanna be a restaurant? Get some chefs and be a restaurant! Wanna be a lounge? You can do it buonanotte!
