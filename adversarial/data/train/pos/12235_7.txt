Cute apartments that are conveniently located within walking distance to 35th ave and greenway rd bus lines, grocery store, fast food, gas station, restaurants, and more.\n\nA very quick drive to even more options!\n\nThere are a lot of beautiful trees and grass, 2 pools, and adequate parking.\n\nThe office staff is friendly, and the rates are reasonable.\n\nA 2 bed, 2 bath floor plan that I've seen has a great layout and decent space. Best part in the kitchen is the pantry!!\n\nThe grounds are kept up nicely.\n\nI'd recommend checking out the apartments to anyone seeking in the immediate area. There are a few complexes around, but this one definitely has charm.
