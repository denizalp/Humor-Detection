This school is a scam!! don't waste your money and go here! I attended this school in 2010 and I wasted a money and a whole year of my time. They were suppose to help me after graduating and never did, I had all A's and finished all my internship hours, and I had to chase after them in order for the school to talk to me. Still to this day I do not have a career in the medical field all I have is a stupid piece of paper telling me I graduated the program, and debt to my name! DON'T GO HERE!!!
