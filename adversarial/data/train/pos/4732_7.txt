Tech sent had to come back and fix his work. Both times the same tech was a total schmuck to my wife. condescending, not very good at quality... mostly if they replaced the dirtbag late 80's ex rocker for a tech, i could deal with the work. But until they get rid of the singular tech that is running their company into the ground, their review will not improve. \n\nAfter investing thousands with this company, i would never return to them again. Lesson = learned.
