How does this joint stay in business?!?!\n\nI've never actually eaten there because of the incredibly rude and seemingly incompetent staff. My second attempt was today. After order a roll and waiting twenty minutes to be served, I approached counter to let the server know that I would not be waiting any longer (I took a second to look at the grill - there was zero sign of my roll being prepared). The server was on the phone - when I told him that I was leaving after he paused his conversation for a second - he said \"Yeah yeah yeah\" dismissingly. \n\nPlease do not waste your time, energy or money on this establishment. They do not deserve it.
