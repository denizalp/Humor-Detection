First time visit to this location, second visit to a First watch resturaunt. I have to say they are consistent, great food and spotty service. The atmosphere in this location is pretty bland to the other one we were in.  \n\nWe ordered the Pork Belly & Grits, smoked salmon frittata, biscuit & Gravy and the super food kale salad. All the food was great from the flavors to the texture and seasonings very delightful. The dishes presentation was nice and the food did arrive quickly, but the server for some reason could not remember to refill our drinks but was quick to give us the bill to pay and leave. As much as their service needs work we will return because of the food.
