Are you a bootlegger?\n\nNo I don't mean from the prohibition period when alcohol was banned, and the art of making brewski's had to move underground, away from prying eyes (and thus the evolution of something like Henry Weinhardt's root beer for that pseudo foamy bubble drink, not talking about \"bubble tea\" (aka tapioca milk tea) either).\n\n\"Bootleggers' is actually an aweful word, but for those not quite in the know, it can mean those who enjoy live recordings of music so much to the point where they must collect it to enhance their music collection and appreciate the performances that take on dimensions of further enjoyment beyond dry and stale studio albums once they go beyond rotation on ipods and cd players. This is why good talented musicians can go beyond re-creating the album listening experience, and maybe no two live performances of the same song are identical (unless we're talking synthesized and pre-programmed and sequenced muzak).\n\nAnd Edge102 is one of the best radio stations in my live music collecting history, in that not only do they have to accumen to treat their listening base right, but they go to great lengths to promote the big name acts in town, even helping the artists to create buzz about the latest releases. My favorite part is of course when they have the artists in the studio doing interviews and also live sessions (sometimes acoustic), or they flat out broadcast a show that is happening in town, live when it is happening without commercial interruptions or annoying DJ interruptions and jingles (Spanish and French radio are ridiculous for doing that during live broadcasts!)\n\nHere are some of Edge 102's glorious moments of live music broadcast history (also big thanks to director Alan Cross for making this happen)\n\nThe Cure Curiosa 2004 Toronto at the Molson Amiphitheater - the entire gig was broadcast live, the only FM broadcast of the tour.\n\nColdplay Molson Amphitheater 2003 - Canadian fans got a bonus encore of Lips Like Sugar (Echo & The Bunnymen Cover)\n\nGem and Noel of Oasis did an intimate promo acoustic gig 2 years ago at some club in Toronto (promoting greatest hits disc and played a ton of b-sides and rare songs). \n\nBlack Rebel Motorcycle Club (aka the Jesus and Mary Chain cover band) did a killer but short acoustic set to promote their debut album, and I'm sure they came back again for the last few albums.\n\nAnd the cooooooooooooolest broadcast of all?\n\nI flew up to Toronto August 03 to see Radiohead at the Molson. 3 days before the gig, one hour after getting out of the airport, the whole city all the way down to New York suffered a massive power outtage. The band had to rescheduled the gig to October, and had played Montreal the night before (unaffected). Edge102 and Radiohead worked out a deal to broadcast a good chunk of an hour of the Montreal broadcast for Edge 102 and Radiohead fans as a consolation price.\n\nIn the lyrics of Radiohead's Creep, \"you're so fucking special!\"\n\nThanks Edge102 for showing these artists and more so much love.
