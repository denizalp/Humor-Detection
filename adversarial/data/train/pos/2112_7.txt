Wait ... no. Parking is free*. (*As of the date of publishing.)\n\n- They will lie to your face. Don't gift me with a voucher to a closed show in exchange for purchasing gift cards. I am not a tourist and I will one-star yo' ass**. (**raises brow.)\n\n- They don't even possess the decency to permit indigent people to lay around as in real town squares. Is it a town square or not?\n\n- Yuppies. Too many yuppies. Yuppies will be offended when reading this***.

I don't ever forgive. \n\nI distinctly recall purchasing two gift cards (that I still fucking have, goddammit!) with a value of 250$ or 350$, or some nonsense like that, for vouchers to tickets to shows. One of the vouchers was for a show that was closed. The goddamn show was closing within nights of my purchase, and actually within the window that you were running your fucking promotion\/scam. I don't forget Town Square Las Vegas. I never forget. \n\nHere's your much deserved one-star after all this time. Moreover, Rock of Ages wasn't even that good anyway; especially when accounting for the fact that I purchased in excess of 500$ in useless gift cards for the privilege to attend that show alone 'free' of charge*. \n\n(*For that amount, Tom Cruise better be in the cast. And, he might have to give me an additional favour as well.)\n\nFirst hand customer experiences: \nCheck the check-ins. First of all, there is tons of parking (and it's free!) as well as a RTC stop right along LV Blvd. where the SDX stops. There are stores, bars, a movie and stageplay theatre, faux parks, et. cetera. I have been in several of them -- and even reviewed a couple (see below) -- and \"primarily relevant\" to a consumer experience is presumably engaging in that activity. I have watched shit, eaten shit, drank shit, bought shit, taken a shit ....\n\nThe above paragraph is included because Yelp HQ is figuratively braindead and cannot distinguish \"Real People, Real Reviews®\" contributions from whatever reviews they should actually be removing via moderation with their power. I have been to this fucking glorified strip mall and ...\n\nIndividual stores reviewed\nAMC Town Square 18 - Two-stars\nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz\/amc-town-square-18-las-vegas-2?hrid=5TY65dA91ds3YhBrvj_S9g&utm_campaign=www_review_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct)\nBy the way: they maintain prices as if they were a premium theatre.
