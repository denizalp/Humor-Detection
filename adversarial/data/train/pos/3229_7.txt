What female doesn't enjoy the pleasures of experimenting with all kinds of pretty lipstick, blush, eyeshadows and nail polish.  A true playground of glamor!\n\nThis store is very large and well- stocked with said products and then some.  It can be very intimidating at first.  It was for me, but I chose to hang out at one chunk of the store until I had my bearings!  I did look for some guidance from one of the store clerks, but they were nonexistent for the most part.  I even found it odd they didn't greet their customers, or ask if assistance was needed as they passed by.\n\nCustomers are left to roam and freely touch and play with all of the displays of cosmetics.  I am not so sure I like to see this much freedom given, since good hygiene habits are not practiced by all.  In fact, I wasn't all that impressed with the general condition of the store.  Cleanliness did not seem to be a priority.  For instance, the bathroom soap dispenser lid was broken and very little soap was making its way out.  How does this get overlooked by staff?  Especially when all they need to do is walk out into the store and grab a working bottle off of the shelf!\n\nOverall, I found some nice products to try, and was able to make a purchase based on the benefits of try before you buy.
