I love coming here for their lunch specials! Luckily, their lunch specials run from Monday to Saturday until 3pm :) \n\nMy favorite dishes to get from the lunch special menu include: hot and spicy beef noodles, savory herb beef noodles, and tonkatsu. \n- I absolutely love the beef noodles soups. They're so rich in flavor and keeps you warm during those cold Cleveland winters :) \n- The tonkatsu is also freakin delicious! The porks are just the right amount of crispy and their sauce is amazing! \n\nThe servers are always very attentive and checks up on you every so often. I definitely recommend trying out this restaurant if you're in the area!
