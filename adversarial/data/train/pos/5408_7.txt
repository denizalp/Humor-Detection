My big complaint... OMG!  The benches outside the office which is in Costco are ridiculously uncomfortable!\n\nThe exam and paperwork were fine and I liked the doc.  They didn't accept VSP but made sure I had the paperwork necessary when I left to make a claim.\n\nThe best part was walking outside and being able to get really affordable glasses at costco. (which does accept VSP)    Between $85 exam and cost of glasses it was probably half of what I paid last time in regular doc office.
