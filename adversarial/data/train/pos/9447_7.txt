To all the haters: Let me start by putting the B.S. rumor about, \"lack of flavor\" to rest. I came here today with the initiative of getting 2 of these bad boys and I left with one...and one was PLENTY! Soooo freakin good! I had the salted caramel sandwiched between 2 double chocolate cookies and it was bursting with flavor! So rich and tasty! Seriously, if you think these delectable sandwiches lack flavor, then you should probably avoid eating Texas sheet cake for breakfast and brushing your teeth with high fructose corn syrup. \n\nIt's dangerous how close this place is to my house...I almost asked for an application just so I could enjoy the benefits of working there.
