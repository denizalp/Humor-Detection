Always been a fan\n\nQuick Trip is always a great gas station to refuel, as well as freshen up and who doesn't love the soda fountain station and multitude of snacks. \n\nI have to admit I am hooked on the soft pretzels from the QT kitchen, I always seem to find myself ordering a fresh hot pretzel before I leave the store.\n\n Cheap gas, ice cold drinks, and snacks. Does it get any better.
