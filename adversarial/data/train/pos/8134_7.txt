Well generally I don't like going to the dentist. And this place isn't really any different. You still feel ripped off and don't really know whats going on. I don't like dentists.\n\nWhat they do right:\n- Very friendly, helpful and polite reception staff. For me all dentists are pretty much the same and its the front staff that make or break the experience.\n- Clean, well kept space with TV's in all the check up rooms etc. (fancy!)\n- Early morning appointments (7am!)\n\nWhat they do wrong:\n- They're dentists
