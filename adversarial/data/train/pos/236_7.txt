Uncle Sam's is huge. And on the day I went, Uncle Sam's was freezing cold. So cold that I think I saw a polar bear run by. So cold that I had to zip my jacket all the way up and wear the hood.  Does it cost too much to heat this joint or what?\nOther than that, the pizza was good, our server was great and the portions were huge.  I'd say the food is pretty inexpensive for the amount that you get too.  \nIf I watched football or basketball, or actually any sport at all, I'd definitely come here for that. Plus I've heard that you won't find a better Philly cheesesteak in Arizona- if you're into that kinda thing.\nAll in all, Uncle Sam's is a fairly cheap, fun and casual spot to come for dinner or lunch.
