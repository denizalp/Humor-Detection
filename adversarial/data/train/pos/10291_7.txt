I've been working with Pro-Tect Security for a couple of months now for one of my HOA's and so far they are doing a great job. Jason recently took over as VP and he is pro-active, solution-oriented, and very good on communication. He is right there to resolve issues and work with my Clients on requests which caters to their needs. This company is great business partner to have for security services!
