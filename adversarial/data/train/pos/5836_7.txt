The Beautiful Carin and I stepped out a little bit on Saturday night. I had been out of town most of the week and it was really great to get back to warm evenings and happy smiling people.\nIn effort to get out of my rut of thinking that I only need to go places that I can walk to, Carin and I went over to Sunnyslope and the Art Walk on Saturday evening (thanks to Christina P. for putting this up on Yelp! : )\nIt was really nice event and we enjoyed walking around, talking with the artists and crafts people and a couple of fellow yelpers. We were looking for something to eat. Based on several reviews and some word of mouth at the Art Walk, we were going to try Bombero's...no dice...they were at capacity and it didn't look to be getting better, so we strolled a bit farther south to Corbins.\nIt's a nice little place! We walked in without a reservation, and we were greeted by one of the managers (owners?) and they found us a table on the patio right away. Clearly, they were just slammed by all the people form Art Walk, but the service was really very good, esp. considering the workload (by the time we left, people were piled up waiting to get in).\nIt was nice warm evening, just right for a little cocktail (vodka martis) and some spinach dip (they do a nice spinach-artichoke heart dip...they crisp up their chips in the wood fired oven just before they bring the order out, so...nice touch!).\nCarin had a pulled pork salad, which was inventive and tasty...barbecued pork with just hint of healthiness! I had shrimp and pesto quesadilla...pretty good and very crispy, with plenty of shrimp and great pesto flavor...but more like a pizza than a quesadilla.\nWe only made one mistake at Corbin's...we should have had dessert there, instead of what we chose...oh well, live and learn.\nCorbins is a nice choice for good eats in Sunnyslope, esp. on the patio on a warm spring evening.
