I decided not give a single star since the granite dude didn't actually work at my house. The reason I gave such a low number of stars is this. I do most of my repairs through the reviews I find on Yelp. Usually this works out great. unfortunately this time that is not the case. I have a piece of granite that was installed incorrectly when I bought my house. The piece is severely cracked and needs replaced. I contacted the granite dude and left my number. He called me back and asked that that I text him a picture which I did. After a day or two with no follow up I called and left a message asking for my quote. No response. I then texted the number a few days later again no response.  It would have been nice to have been called to let me know the price or if they weren't interested.
