We visted this place several years ago and throughly enjoyed it. I would have rated it 3.5-4 stars back then.  Oh how the mighty have fallen. On our recent trip we had dinner here and it was bad!  Alot of the food was old and cold. The king crab legs tasted like salt licks and a large number of other dishes were too scary looking to try. The prime rib and desert section was Aria's only saving grace. The gelato was housed in a revolving freezer that sort of reminded my of a Ice Cream Pistol LOL.  Avoid eating here as this is no longer a good buffet.  There is an all you can drink option for beer and wine for $12.99.  I suppose if you drink enough the food might taste better LMAO\n\nThe lobster shown in photos is availble on Fridays and I think Saturday, the price is considerably higher and you are limited to 1\/2 lobster tail per person.
