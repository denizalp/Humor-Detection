Warning: I'm not a buffet person, nor will I ever be. The concept of unlimited food disturbs me so read on with caution... \n\n\nKind of a scary place but if you want a salad and lots of it, I guess its a good choice. I love the name 'Sweet Tomatoes' which is why I came here in the first place but there really isn't much sweet about watching a slue of morbidly obese children return to the ice cream machine 5 times for refills.
