This is a dive bar that serves up some above average food and some below average food. The atmosphere is dark with many stuffed hunted animals decorating the wall.\n\n I tried the walleye pike. They coated the fish with a cornmeal kind of fish fry mix. Traditional coating for a sweet mild meaty walleye pike is a cracker crust or a beer batter so the corn meal was unexpected. Most of the fish was good but the ends were a little dry and chewy. Possibly from being microwaved or maybe from being freezer burnt. The kitchen is open so I did see the microwave oven getting a lot of use here. My platter also came with sweet but tasty cole slaw and shoe string fries that were very similar to Burger King kind of fries.\n\nMy husband had the French Dip. The beef was roasted in house and was very good but they served it topped with processed Swiss cheese and served it on a budget squishy soft roll.\n\nIt would take very little work for the food to be four stars here with some of the above average food they serve like buffalo burgers, walleye pike and the very good house roasted beef but the subpar bread, fries, processed cheese, cornmeal fry mix and heavy use of microwave cooking brings the level down. \n\nService was above average and was thoughtful and welcoming.\n\n2.5 stars
