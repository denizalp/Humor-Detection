Huge bar, crazy party-people in the house 110%\n\nTake your out-of-towner friends here when they come to Toronto to party-party-party. Otherwise Stay Away Joe! Local Torontonians, I say come here for:\n\n-Summertime patio beers at sunset.\n\n-The piano bar on Thursday (Matt and Mike, either one kills it!)\n\n-If you want to try and pick up 18-year-old drunk chicks.\n\nOtherwise, Stay Away Joe!
