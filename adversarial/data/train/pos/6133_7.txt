ONE WORD! FILTHY!  Place should be closed by SNHD. Guess what no one cares either. Staff is miserable, managers don't care. Food is unavailable. Dinning areas are a giant mess. Half the games are broken. Great concept lots and lots of work to make it better. For 10.99 you can get a crap buffet any where in this town with many more options that are available. Endless lines of empty trays. Here's an idea pay more staff and cook more food. Clean your floors and bathrooms. Just close and start over.\nI attempted to talk to who I believed to be the GM. Tall and gray older man. He said what can I go for you sir. I explained I was at the establishment with 19 other people. Business owners in the food industry as well. I told him the place was messy, no food, rude staff, and down right filthy. He said I'm sorry you feel that way and he walked away. Really what a bum.
