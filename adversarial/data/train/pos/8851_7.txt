More of a 3.5 star, but a solid lunch option!\n\nI had a SALAD which I thought was really good value. It was $8, I had the barbacoa, it came served with lots of lettuce, salad, fresh guac, tasty black beans, a good portion of meat (I skipped the sour cream and cheese). The portion was large. Nearby customers eating burritos looked like they had an adequate portion too.\n\nMy friend had the crispy tacos, she tried shrimp ($8). They didn't come with any sides and although she said they were super tasty, the portion size was tiny compared to my salad, as the 3 tacos didn't come with anything. (They should add a small side salad or something to make it an adequate lunch).\n\nToppings were all very fresh and they had some interesting menu items. We waited about 5 mins for our food, not bad considering it was 12:15pm, prime lunch hour.
