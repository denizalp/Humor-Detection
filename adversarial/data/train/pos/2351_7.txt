With the soap container were replaced with ketchup bottled, the bathrooms were quite nice. There are 3 bathrooms : men, women and both : ) \n\nIf you get bored of washing your hands the conventional way, there is the giant water fountain to clean your hands that is reminiscent of a school time when everyone used to wash their hands together. \n\nThe crowd was mid 20's to 30's, it was a good looking variety of men, mainly French men , lots of French friendly men,  enthusiastic happy bunch of people. More men than women \n\nMy friends told me the drinks were great and the price was reasonable. \nMaybe it was the youthful decor but this place reminded of the high school spirit  without the awkwardness that I always felt being labelled as a nerd. Nerds are considered cool over here. \n\nA quick tip: get there before midnight or you will get caught in the line.
