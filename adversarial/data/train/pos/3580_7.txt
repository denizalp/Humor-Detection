Popped in here to pick up a few things for my camera before my trip to Spain.   After a bit of wandering semi-aimlessly in an attempt to find what I was looking for I finally gave up and found someone to assist me.  [I can be worse than a man sometimes when it comes to asking for directions or assistance.]  \nI finally found what I needed, plus a few more trinkets and gadgets that at the time I felt I couldn't live without.  But that little LED flashlight keychain came in handy when the electricity went out on us at the hotel in Spain one early evening.  \nIt pays to be prepared....;)
