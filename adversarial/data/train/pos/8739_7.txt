I LOVE Clearly Contacts, and NO I did not at all know they had a physical store! HELLO, STORE!!!\n\nIt's the only place I'll buy my glasses. I don't take care of my glasses, I'm very lousy. And it hurts me to pay $500 for a pair that I'll destroy in a month. So I don't buy. I would instead wear contact lenses for 18 hours just to avoid glasses.\nENTER: CLEARLY CONTACTS .ca\n\nSo I bought my pair online over a year ago. The service is fantastic.\n\n365-DAY RETURN POLICY. \n\nWho's going to beat that?\n\nAnd yes I've taken advantage of the return policy. VERY EASY to deal with!!! \n\nNow, I love them. Yes. \nBut the actual store? OH, MY. ALSO 5 STARS. \n\nThey had SO many people to help. Everybody is friendly, we didn't at all feel pressured to buy. AGAIN: SO MANY PEOPLE TO HELP! They're just EVERYWHERE! And they're super friendly! \n\n- The store has about 30% of its actual inventory. If you find something you like online, they can order it for you to try in store. No obligations, no shipping fees\n- If your glasses' arms are too long, they can adjust this to fit you better (they did mine!)\n- At the moment it's 15% off the pair you buy in-stores\n- But yes, you can still buy yours online at your own time.\n\n\nTHIS IS PROBABLY ON YOUR MIND: UH, THE QUALITY OF MY GLASSES?\nI took advantage of the \"first pair free\" promo -available only on selected glasses of course. I was looking for something simple anyways. The first pair had a slanted bolt, which made the glasses look stupidly slanted on my face. I had this for 8 months because I was too lazy to return them. In the end I did return and received a new 100% perfect pair.\nI paid $30 total for: shipping, the lenses, and anti-glare? Something like that? It's like $10 for each \"service\" you need on your lenses. I didn't pay return shipping.\nThe first 3 months of owning this frame, it was heavy (I bought big ones) and sat on my cheeks uncomfortably. I reminded myself that they're cheap, deal with them. A year later, my face gets tired after a long day (20 hours) of wearing glasses (before, I'd be tired at hour 6). But I love them a lot! They look great, they're a tad heavy still (I'm -4) and they slide down my face often. But whatever! They work, they're pretty. My friend's glasses (from Clearly) broke :(\n\nFor the glasses snob out there, I'm actually a makeup snob. So I get you. I buy NARS. I don't buy L'Oreal. But for glasses, I really don't want to spend a fortune. Clearly Contacts sells brands like Kate Spade and Armani as well! (Mine, unfortunately, are the cheapest kind. But I get compliments all the time when I wear them. SO HA.)
