Paul Hillier is one of the best event photographers I encountered in the numerous events I attended.\n\nPaul doesn't only take awesome photos, but I love how he interact with his subjects.. the results are photographs that are full of energy and positive vibe...\n\nI do wish he let me look at some of my own photos before publishing... a little photo shop might help?? \n\n** Why are my eyes CLOSED!!!
