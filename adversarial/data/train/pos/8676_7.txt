Ever since this place opened we keep coming back for more. I can't believe I haven't reviewed this place yet! When me and my husband eat out we prefer to eat somewhere that is relatively healthy and this fits the bill. Grilled food and salad is the way to go.\n\nThe staff are friendly, cheery and helpful.\n\nThe store is cute and clean. It was on the food network as a plus!\n\nThe food is beyond delicious. Our fav go to light dinner place that's for sure. Their chicken is tender and moist and their tikka kabob are such tender cuts of beef. Their rice is fluffy and delicious and their naan is to die for.\n\nTheir pricing is average. As of late they have been relatively busy and we like to order for pickup because it is becoming harder and harder to find a place to sit.\n\nTheir washrooms are clean (although located in the weirdest spot!) and that keeps me reassured of their kitchen cleanliness practices.\n\nOverall DEFINITELYYY go here. It will keep you coming back for more.
