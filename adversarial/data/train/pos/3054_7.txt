Fun spot.. here before the official Grand Opening. This place has the charm in the decor as it's brother establishment - CommonWealth on Fremont Street, but in a slightly understated - streamlined and still eloquent version. \n\nBlvd. Cocktail Company is clearly designed to serve the masses. Comfortable seating, open building front that faces the Linq walkway.. the whole area is a bizzaro universe, upscale version of the Fremont Experience downtown Las Vegas. \n\nThey have many reasons for me to visit every once in awhile ...so updated reviews to follow! Happy Drinking!
