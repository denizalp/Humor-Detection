Horey crap this place just made me explode!! My tastebuds that is! ;) man oh man this place just went down in my books of good eating. This is THE place! \n\nThis fine place is a bar type restaurant hence the name, oyster bar. I thought it was a restaurant type setting but I was wrong. There isn't a lot of seating so There's always a LONG line for it but believe me. It's worth it!!! \n\nThe food: \n\nLOBSTER PAN ROAST 10\/10!! - SO amazing I can't even explain it. So creamy, flavorful, explosion. Lobster cooked perfectly. Tender, buttery and plentiful :O NOODLES cooked to perfection!!! O god.. I can taste it now!! \n\nOYSTERS: fresh, succulent. Delicious! \n\nService: friendly service from the guys behind the bar. Thank you!!!!
