I've been putting this one off for a while. It's hard because I love Meat and Potatoes, their \"sister\" restaurant. And while they are very similar in terms of food, I just don't think they're quite there yet.\n\nI've had the trout, which was good, but still not on par with M n' P. I've also dived into their breads, which are very good. But I feel like I'm still looking for something to set them apart. I know it will happen... or hope at least!\n\nBut the drinks... Oh the drinks! They are spectacular! I mean, I want to drink there every night. Which would probably mean I have a problem... but it's just so good. I'm so into the Boulavardier. I can't help but get that every time I'm there. I know I need to branch out though, I realize I'm tying myself down. But sometimes I can't help myself!\n\nThe attention to detail in decor is incredible. It makes me feel like I'm in a secluded writer's cabin, if you ignore all the people eating and drinking inside. I love the squirrels on the wall and the little corner with the desk and typewriter. Every time I'm there I find some other little bobble or decoration to admire.\n\nThe one negative is the bathroom. As everyone else has noted, it is... interesting. I get it. It's supposed to be like stalls in a barn. I know, you can lock the door so that no one can get in, even though there's two stalls. But you don't learn that you can lock the door until you've been in there a handful of times. If you're the lucky one who doesn't know, you're sure to get a peak at something you might not want to see or someone will get a looksie at your goodies. Just bein' honest folks. \n\nMaybe that's why you need to just have bother drink there??
