Good price and I appreciate the 2 Free luggage check in with 1 carry-on. However, bring rubber gloves and a degree of separation from the seats. Absolutely disgusting! Tray tables clearly don't get whipped down well. There is a build up of food and dirt around the edges, booger smears on the back fo the seat in front of me. There is face grease all over the windows.  I really am grossing out big time
