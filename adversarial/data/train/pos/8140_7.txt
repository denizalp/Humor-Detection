We had a great experience at é.  There are only 2 seatings per night and each seating only serves 8 guests.  We were served 19 dishes at a counter top.  Every dish was beyond delicious.  I recall having thoughts like \"This is the best bean I have ever had!\" or \"This is the best calamari I have ever had!\" or \"This is the best ___ I have ever had!\" dish after dish.  Molecular gastronomy is fun, and it takes food preparation onto a whole new level.  I still highly recommend é based on the complexity of flavors though, not based on the creativitiy of the foams, alginates, and other chemical reactions I cease to understand.\n\nSome of the other reviewers commented on the fast pace; I thought the pace was great.  For me, I just want to EAT, so I do not want to wait forever between courses.  For 19 dishes, it took us about 2 1\/2 hours to finish.  The couple next to us got the additional wine pairing.  I can see that they were a little rushed to finish chugging their drinks with each course.\n\nMy only feedback for é is to talk more about the ingredients and preparations to the guests.  The chefs plated in front of all the guests, but did not explain anything until they finished plating.  During the entire time, all of us were silently thinking, \"What the heck is that now?!\"  To make the dinner more interactive, it would be great that the chefs do a little more teaching.\n\nThe dinner is $250 per person, but I thought the price was worth the experience.  Others gamble away their money, I eat away my money!
