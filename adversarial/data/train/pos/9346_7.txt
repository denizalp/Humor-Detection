5 stars here denotes \"Woohoo! As good as it gets\".\n\nAnd that really IS the case with Savera. My partner and I (TH) recently had our second visit.\n\nOur first visit was a smashing success, with friendly service and absolutely wonderful food (and contrary to her review, I don't remember the service being slow - but my memory might fail me).\n\nThe second visit was more of the same. The Malai\/Paneer Kofta was fantastic again - completely consistent with the first visit. \n\nThe only Malai Kofta that compares, is the 5th Element Kofta, which is COMPLETELY different, thus I can appreciate them both for their uniqueness in the same way that I love both Tim Burton's Batman and Christopher Nolan's.\n\nI just compared Savera to Batman... I mean seriously, do you need a better endorsement?\n\nWhy are you still reading this? Aren't you hungry yet?
