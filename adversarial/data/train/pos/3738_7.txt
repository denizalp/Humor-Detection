8\/11\/11\n\nAfter reading so many reviews about how great Maggiano's happy hour was, I decided to check it out myself and use a $10 gift card that Maggiano's had sent to me in honor of my birthday.  [Yes, I'm writing this review almost two years' later... I am that backlogged with reviews and photos- bear with me.  I don't think that these should be discounted based on how long it's been since these visits, because I (and others) could use these observations to see if the restaurants and their service and products have improved, or in some cases, worsened.)]  \n\nWas going to try a couple of the apps when I spotted the Four-Cheese Ravioli http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/maggianos-little-italy-scottsdale-3?select=GzMWRgNr3Im5eTXGK5rFiQ#GzMWRgNr3Im5eTXGK5rFiQ on the dinner menu.  The description mentioned ricotta, cream cheese, mozz, and provolone in a pesto-alfredo cream sauce, and I was hooked (\"ricotta,\" \"pesto,\" and \"alfredo\" hook me in 95% of the time).  Unfortunately, the dish was a HUGE letdown... http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/maggianos-little-italy-scottsdale-3?select=dMECY1zFqidngRglm1e3sA#dMECY1zFqidngRglm1e3sA  All but two of the ravioli were half-frozen (especially at the edges), and the flavors?  All of the cheeses, marinara sauce, and pesto-alfedo cream sauce tasted the same!  All bland, without any distinction between them.  I tasted samples from allover the plate, from all components, separately and together, and couldn't discern any difference.  Even the entree's appearance was subpar.  Suffice it to say, I have not stepped foot into another Maggiano's since.\n\nThe two good comments I could say are that the restaurant was quiet (no one was there) and the plates were quaint-looking, with that old-fashioned rose-and-bone tinted floral print.
