Came here the other day for lunch with my mom. Wanted to check out a new spot for us in the neighborhood. \n\nWe ordered a bunch of different items on the menu as we were really excited to try a new place. Shrimp tempura, chicken katsu, shrimp fried rice.\n\nFood was okay. I didn't care for the sauces served with the shrimp tempura and chicken katsu.\n\nOwner was really nice and our boba was on the house.\n\nNot sure if I'll be back.\nLoved the interior. Parking lot makes parking easy.
