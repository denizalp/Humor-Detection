Wow- what a let down. I went there with my best friend hoping for a nice afternoon. The girl who did my friends nails was pretty rough and agressive with her. My experience was nice, until came time to pay. I've been getting my nails done for TWO YEARS STRAIGHT, and I usually ask for a gel refill, and pay that set price. This time, I get to the cash, 63$ for my refill!!!! Turns out I was being charged 20$+tax extra for the polish i chose. WITHOUT being told until it was too late. This was really unfortunate because I could no longer afford to treat my friend. The woman working there was rude and blaming me, saying I should have known, despite the fact that it literally says POLISH INCLUDED under gel refill. She said if I didn't like it I could sit down and she'd take it off. As if, after I'd spent 1+h sitting there getting it done... anyway, seriously disturbing and disappointing experience. Do not recommend.
