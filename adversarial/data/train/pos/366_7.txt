Butterjoint wasn't on the top of the list of my places to check out in Pittsburgh, but it was Monday and a lot of places weren't open. That ended up being ok, because our experience there was pretty good. \n\nWhen we arrived there was a wait, but they have a tasteful beer selection and it was still happy hour. Eric was our server; he was very professional and friendly. No issues with the service at all! \n\nFor an appetizer we ordered the pickled radishes. We wanted something that wouldn't fill us up too much before dinner. This was a very simple appetizer with some amazing, bold flavors. The radishes were lacto-fermented and served with a perfectly contrasting creamy chili mayo. \n\nWe ordered the pierogies which were served with caramelized onions, sauerkraut (our choice), and sour cream. A good chunk of the menu is taken up by pierogi options which was surprising to me at the time, but then I finally put it together given the strong Polish roots in Pittsburgh. These pierogies had a nice chew to them and all the components worked nicely together. Would I order it again though? No. I was curious to see if there was something I was missing out on. Don't get me wrong, who wouldn't like potato and cheese stuffed dough? I just have a feeling there were stronger, more interesting menu items that should have been had. \n\nThe other item we ordered was the hamburger with Goot Essa cheddar. This was prepared well-- and you can tell that it is ground in house. Really good flavor. \n\nI'm giving Butterjoint 4\/5 stars, but I have a feeling if I chose more adventurous menu items it could have easily been 5 stars. As far as food that I had on my recent trip in Pittsburgh, it definitely was at the top and if in town again I would definitely go back. Little side notes: atmosphere was hip and who ever was playing the music was playing some excellent tunes.
