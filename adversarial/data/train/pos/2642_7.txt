If I could I'd give it a -1 star!  Sat there for an hour went to have a tooth extracted.  When I was given a consent form to sign I said I have a couple questions for the dentist first.  His response was what questions its self explanatory.  I said well maybe he could at least look in my mouth before yanking my tooth out of my head.  Very unprofessional dentist.  I got up and walked out before the butt every came in to see me!  DO NOT GO HERE!!
