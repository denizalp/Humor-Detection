It would be so fun if we could have a big Yelp hide and seek event here.  I found some good places I could hide at!\n\nBut anyways, I had no idea what IKEA was about when I got here, all I saw were arrows on the floor and displays with barcodes.  So here I was taking pictures of items I wanted or possibly wanted, looking at places I could hide, and was wondering damn these items were cheap as hell.\n\nWhen we got to the end, I found out the hard way that these things were unassembled.  No wonder they're cheap.  So 8 heavy boxes later we were off to go.  Didn't even get to try the food.  Ugh, I'll know better next time.  Dang I also looked silly pushing around a push cart a quarter of the way inside the store. You don't need it at all.
