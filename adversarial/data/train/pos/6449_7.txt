Taking days off are a rare occasion for me.\n\nVery long lunches? Yes. Leaving early? Most definitely. Holiday weekends? Guaranteed.\n\nTaking a whole day off, with no plans and no work? Preposterous!\n\nIt was a beautiful spring day, and I decided to take the day off to enjoy the beautiful weather. I took the convertible out of storage and braved  the endless throngs of people out there.\n\nPoor souls. They were rushing to work. While I was simply driving around looking for a place to enjoy a nice quiet breakfast, in stellar surroundings.\n\nThere's no better place to enjoy such a marvelous day than the Arizona Biltmore - one of Arizona's hallmark destinations.\n\nAs I pulled into the entrance, I was warmly greeted by the duo of Valets eager to park my car. It is always so refreshing to be greeted by folks that enjoy their jobs, and it showed on their faces.\n\nI walked through the entrance, made a right, and instead of going to my typical destination here (Wright's restaurant), I went to Frank & Albert's. \n\nThis establishment was definitely bustling with golfer's and other guests that morning. Nearly every seat was taken, but since I was running solo, they didn't have any difficulty in promptly seating me.\n\nAs I was perusing their menu, I had great view of their open view kitchen. It appeared to be well run and efficient.\n\nSpeaking of efficient, I had no less than 3 servers check on me on a regular basis. There was nary a moment wherein I was outside of anyone's view or care. They certainly proved that they take breakfast seriously here.\n\nSpeaking of breakfast, I opted for one of the heavier dishes on the menu. I had a long day, and I didn't want to be distracted by pangs of hunger by the time mid-afternoon rolled around. I scheduled a last minute major medical visit, and I was already anticipating that this was going to be a long day, devoid of any fun or sustenance, even if it was my day off.\n\nNonetheless, my day started off well at Frank & Albert's. I chose the Blackened Steak, accompanied by Over Easy Eggs, and potatoes. \n\nThe Blackened Steak was quite juicy. I detected a hint of tartness with the sauce that enveloped it. Yet, it still was delicious and satisfying. I will note that I wasn't entirely a fan of the mushrooms that were laid on top of the steak. I am not a fan of raw mushrooms. They were covered in the tart sauce, but it didn't cover up the sooty taste of the raw mushrooms.\n\nThe eggs, on the other hand, had a marvelously prepared exterior, with a very tasteful yolk that is sure enrich one's bad cholesterol count. However, bad cholesterol is not my issue.\n\nThe red, steamed potatoes were delightfully prepared. The interior was both soft and moist. I enjoyed the crisp skins and their salty taste.\n\nAlong with the stellar service, and the great food, the view of the grounds made for a wonderful breakfast dining experience at this resort. It was a great way to open a day off that maybe wouldn't have been so great otherwise.
