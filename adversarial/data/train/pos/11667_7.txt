If you are afraid of biting your fingers off, don't go to this place, it is really that GOOD!\nThe overall decor is relaxingly (that's the word) rustic, small and filled with constant buzz from all the conversations happening simultaneously. Tall and handsome Sous chef\/DJ spins vinyl records while preparing pig ears, so sexy! All chefs wear white t-shirts lovingly hugging every biceps curve on their working hands so capable of producing culinary orgazms, servers are friendly, attentive and full of knowledgeable recommendations.\n\nThe food flows nicely with the atmosphere, saucy ribs covered with crusty peanuts, crispy but fatty pig tails, delicious hushpuppies and OMG banana cream pie that's to die for, am I in heaven already?\n\nGo and discover for yourself the feeling of vivifying electricity running from your eyes to your guts to the fingertips, just be careful not to bite off the latter.
