This is the first Firehouse Subs I have ever been to.  Hard to fathom, I know.  But I did some research online and ordered the sweet and spicy meatball, which appears to be a semi-secret off-menu item.  It was pretty good!  Nice amount of spice and yummy melted cheese on top.\n\nHowever, this location's claim to fame, so to speak, and the reason why I went to this location specifically, is the soda machine (see pic).  Very high-tech, but when I actually used it, I realized that they just have a bunch of flavored syrups which you can appropriately, or inappropriately, mix with your favorite soft drink.  Some combinations are pretty gross, in my opinion.  Who wants a vanilla-flavored Sprite?\n\nI appreciate that they have non-caffeinated, no-calorie sodas like Sprite Zero and Dasani Sensations.  But keep in mind that if you add the flavored syrup, you will not have a diet drink anymore.  Plus, it is hard to figure out what you are getting, if you are a drink nazi like me.  For example, Dasani Sensations with Lemon - is that the no-calorie version or is it with the lemon syrup that has calories?\n\nFinally, people get enamored with the damn machine and stand in front of it, taking sips of every possible combination.  They only have one machine so it gets super annoying.\n\nBut enough about the drink machine.  The cashier and food prep people were friendly, the food was good, I'll be back.
