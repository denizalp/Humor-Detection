I had to update my review for Zafran's after last night's chicken tikka masala takeout. We just ordered a chicken tikka malasa with a Peshwari naan just because we were close and craving Indian food. We got home to find a thick, viscous layer of pure OIL on top of the chicken tikka masala. GROSS....I have eaten a lot of Indian food but, this was the first time I have seen this. I sat there spooning oil out of my curry for a good 5 minutes and even then, I couldn't get it all. BLEH...The chicken tikka itself tasted ok, it was just an illegal amount of oil. \n\nI doubt I'll be back.
