Ok, forget my old review. Do not go to the Bagel Factory. Even with a groupon this place is a rip off. The past 3 times I have been there they messed up my order. They are not friendly AT ALL. AND apparently it is the new thing to burn everything.\n\nToday, I got 2 sandwiches with lettuce, tomato, and onion, which they charge for, NEITHER OF THEM HAD IT. And then they fight with you to get it. Last time my BF ordered fried french toast and asked for the whipped cream that was supposed to come on it (says it right in the menu he was holding) and the manager refused to give it to him and tried to charge him for it. Effe this place, seriously.
