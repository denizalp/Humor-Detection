What a joke! The sales man didn't see our NO SOLICITING SIGN!!!!....He knocks on the door very hard and plays with the door handle. I called the police! Sure I didn't know who it was at the time, so I answer. The dude smells like rat piss, I almost threw up but he starts telling all about their company..blah blah blah..I read the company name off his sweaty shirt...I tell him several times I already know about this company, I met the lying owner. What's funny, he agreed. I said well get off my property, the police are on their way plus I don't need your outdated shit on my home. I also told him that the company is a scam and the sales people in the company videos are selling products to their own family members trying to trick people but you can tell..they all have the same big nose and foreheads. DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME!!
