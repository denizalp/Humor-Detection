I'm disappointed. \n\nI came here last year and had a good time. Granted it was the weekend. \n\nToday, a weekday, my bf and I came to drais looking for a good time. There were 7 people other than us in the beach \"club.\" \n\nWe grabbed some drinks (60$) and proceeded towards the pool. \n\nThe two \"security\" kept staring at us in a really uncomfortable way. We were standing together, with our arms around eachothers necks enjoying our week away from work when the security came up and told us to separate because we were too close. \n\nWe immediately obliged out of respect of their authority. But for the remainder of the time there we laughed and questioned why we were asked to separate like junior high students.  \n\nWe left after we finished our drinks because they kept starring at us the entire time we were there. Just an fyi to the security working today 10\/12\/16, we weren't having sex or anything near it, we weren't drunk and still aren't writing this review, and you guys are kinda assholes for just standing there creeping out paying customers to the point that we felt we should leave ;( \n\nTwo stars only because I had fun a previous experience. Today = 1star
