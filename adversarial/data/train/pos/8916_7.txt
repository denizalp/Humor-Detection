Since moving to Phoenix a bit over a year ago, Angel's Trumpet has become my favorite place to grab a craft beer and a bite to eat. \n\nIt's a great spot to meet with a group of friends or to just belly up to the bar and try a new beer. Be prepared for a possible wait if you want a spot at the bar though. I've rarely come here when it's not hoppin' (no beer pun intended... actually that's a great beer pun).\n\nSince they regularly change taps, you'll never get bored of the beer selection. That's truly what keeps me coming back again and again. The atmosphere is laid back and the service has always been friendly as well, so that doesn't hurt the return factor either. \n\nAaaaaand that's my no non-sense review update, Cheers!
