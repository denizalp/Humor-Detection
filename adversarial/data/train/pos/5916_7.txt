These folks are CRAZY rude!\nIf you don't kiss their ass when you call they will block your number as they did me after one mere call and simply because I asked one question which was if they had a sauna. Barton Gym, life is short, so many thanks for the phone block and showing your true colors sooner than later. With your nasty, crass, unprofessional attitude your purported \"staff\" will soon be unemployed!
