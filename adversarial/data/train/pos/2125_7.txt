First time trying Guamanian food, and it was a treat. \n\nThe red rice Spam musubi is definitely the highlight here. The red rice makes it unique, and it also has furikake flakes and pickled daikon to give it more tang than your usual spam musubi. I wish the rice was spicier, but it does have an adequate kick to it. I also tried their BBQ chicken plate, chicken kelaguen, and coconut titiyas. The coconut titiyas were like a hybrid between naan and pita bread with a coconut flavor, and it was even more delicious with the butter spread all over it. Mmmmm. The BBQ chicken was flavorful, but the chicken kelaguen was too citrusy in my opinion. \n\nIf I'm ever in the area, I will definitely get my hands on those red rice Spam musubis again.
