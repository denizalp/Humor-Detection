This is the rave of lots of people, saying they have the best sushi here. Came here with my girlfriend and my other couple friend. For some odd reason everyone was impressed with the neat scooper that was used to get your soya sauce from the cup that it came in. Tip to restaurants, add this and you can increase your prices by 10% at least!\n\nThe salad was too salty and the food took a very long time to come. My friend did the ordering since it was his suggestion. He ordered a bunch or items but was surprised with the fact that each order only comes in 2 pieces, we had to double the food. \n\nThe sushi was good. I guess by him talking so much about it primed me to think it tasted better. It wasn't cold and it was warm and soggy, it had a good texture but I personally did not see what all the rave was about.\n\nLike Karen G said I don't think it's worth it for the prices they charges but if you go and sit in front of the Chef as he performs then it might enhance your experience.
