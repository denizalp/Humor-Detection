\"What do you mean I can't just buy one leg? I don't want a thigh.\" 'Have it your way' has yet to arrive at this \"Old-South\" chicken spot. \n\nAfter destroying my smack-talking colleague on the tennis court in a late morning match, he cried out for wings. I'm guessing tearing into innocent little pieces of flesh was his way of soothing his ego for failing to dominate me on court. Men.\n\nHe ordered 10 wings, and I just wanted one chicken leg. \"Ms. Daisy\" at the counter wasn't budging, so I instead got 2 wings. \n\nFunny; a few years ago, my sister called me up furious: \" Why must I hear from the Food Network that the #1 fried chicken place in the country is right there in Charlotte?! As many times as I've visited!\". I had no idea, and hadn't been there, so her next visit, we went. That was about 4 years ago. Hadn't been back since.\n\nIt's good chicken. She was satisfied and returned to NYC with bragging rights. We agreed we would not rate it the \"best in the country\" by any stretch of the imagination. Simple salty fried chicken. Today, the same.
