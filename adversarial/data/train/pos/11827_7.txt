It's not everyday your boyfriend drops you off at another man's house to be massaged. But it was our anniversary, and it was not just any house, it was John's. \n\nI have to admit that I was a bit nervous to be dropped off at a home instead of a spa, but John made me feel welcome from start to finish.  He gets to know you before he takes you into the studio, so he knows exactly what to do to get you the most benefit for your buck. The massage is a perfect in-between massage - it's right in the middle of the \"fluffy, feel-good fancy spa\" massage and \"this is going to hurt in the morning\" massage. He'll get all the knots out that you never knew you had.\n\nIf you're looking for a personalized massage experience and\/or a great gift, look no further. This is it.
