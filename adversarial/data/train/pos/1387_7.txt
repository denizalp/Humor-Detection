Rah!  You pay PAUL BUNYAN PRICES here, but get PAUL BUNYAN PORTIONS.  So it kind of works out.  \n\nI started out by ordering a coconut-crusted chicken salad with spinach, eggs, and pineapple.  Generally, coconut-crusted chicken is a disappointment - the coconut flakes off the chicken, creating two sad little piles of awesome that never quite touch - the Romeo and Juliet of foodstuffs.  \n\nIn this case, though, they'd done a bang-up job.  The chicken was juicy and cooked perfectly, and the crusty coconut wrapped around it to create a buttery coating that was absolutely delectable with every bite.  In addition, there was a soft-boiled egg with a yolk spread out over the spinach leaves, making this a kind of gooey, fattening heaven.  \n\nBUT IT WAS THE SIZE OF MY HEAD. \n\nSeriously.  I like food, but you ever get an appetizer and go, \"Crap, is it too late to send back the main meal?\"  Because I had a steak a-comin', and here I was looking at this football-field-sized expanse of purest green, and the empty space inside my stomach was shrinking by the moment. \n\nOn the other side of the table, my wife and my friend MedKat were eating the remains of a wicker chair they had brought to the table.  No, really.  They said it was tasty, though.\n\nThe steak was a big disappointment.  I asked for medium rare, which in this place evidently means \"dead cow rare,\" and it was supposed to have bleu cheese on top.  It did, but when I hear \"bleu cheese on top,\" I don't think, \"a half-inch-sized chunk of unmelted bleu cheese.\"  I mean, I REALLY had to like bleu cheese, which I did, but this was a solid, imposing hunk that rode proudly atop the meat, like all those African women who balance jars of water on their heads.  \n\nStill, overall, we're looking forward to going back and trying it again.  What we had on the whole was good.  \n\nA couple of other odd notes: \n\n* You have to ask for bread.  This is very strange behavior; I didn't realize bread rationing had started.  We did ask, however, and got cold bread - always a disappointment, but it came with a very yummy vinegar-and-oil dip.  \n\n* They will wrap anything in bacon here.  Seriously, about half the menu items were wrapped in bacon.  I half-expected to see the waitresses emerge wearing bacon wristbands and jewelry.  \n\n* The service, not to put too fine a point on it, sucked.  They were friendly, but we waited forever for our food.  On the other hand, we showed up without reservations on a night when they were preparing for a wedding, so I'm going to give them the benefit of the doubt and say that this was an aberration, since they seemed very nice there.
