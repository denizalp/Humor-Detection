I once worked on a cattle ranch in Central Arizona. What a god-awful job.\nIf you're not getting kicked by calves in the branding chute, or rammed by an angry mother cow, you're working sunup to sundown with no relief. That is until supper time. \n\nOur cook, while rudimentary compared to professional chefs, knew how to cook every type of desert dweller the hands shot daily, but mostly quail and beef. \nWell not since my starry-eyed youth have I tasted a filet sandwich like the one served up at Cowboy Ciao. \nThe sandwich will arrive open-faced with a ramequin of brown gravy, a knoll of thin, juicy fries, (more like pomme frites), and a side of slaw. All delectable. \n\nThe filet transcends any level of tender I'm used to, since my version of tender resides squarely between London broil, and skirt steaks.\n\nNo gnawing (or gumming) your food here. No siree. \nIf you have the time between flights, settle in for a few, have the steak, and imagine what it'd be like to eat beef every day and night for three months.\nYou'd get so stopped up, you'd probably shit in yer saddle...on roundup...in full view of the senior hand who like to beat you up on Friday nights at the Punkin Center Saloon.\n\nI wish someone would invent a time machine. \nI'd go back and fuck him up. BADLY.
