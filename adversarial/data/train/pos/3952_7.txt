Everything is A-Okay, indeed!\n\nI have been to Amici twice in one week-- mainly because I wanted to avoid franchises, which can be a challenge in the suburbs, and two, I wanted to scope out the scene for Mother's Day. \n\nIt is as you would expect it to be-- the staff are members of the family. The dishes taste like they're home-made and the d√©cor was kitchy in an Italian motif. \n\nThe food was pretty good and the prices are between $13-30 for entrees. I had a chicken and rice dish (I can't remember the Italian name) and it was really good. I was craving a homemade meal-- but y'know? didn't want to cook one myself, so this was a perfect alternative. \n\nThe chicken was savory-- and huge! I'm not sure if it was two chicken breasts-- tenderized or one really huge bird! The rice and roasted veggies were filling, in fact, my belly was full because I ate  the veggies and the rice rather than the chicken.\n\nNow, the real reason why I went back to Amici was for the desserts! Oh my lordt!! I ate the caramel chocolate cake both times. It's rich, chocolatey and not overtly sweet. IT. IS. HEAVENLY. It's totally worth not having a beach body for!  And there are gluten-free dessert options too.
