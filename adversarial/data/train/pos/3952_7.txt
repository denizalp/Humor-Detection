Great park with free attractions your kids will love! My nephews have been coming here since they were toddlers and enjoy themselves each time they stop by. The water zone is fun for all. Good time watching my nephews run around waiting for the water to shoot up. You can also rent space for events like a kids party. There's basketball courts and soccer and baseball fields.
