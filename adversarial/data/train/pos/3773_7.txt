Don't plan on getting picked up by Yellow if you are in Lawrenceville past midnight. I waited for over an hour for Yellow Cab on a visit two months ago and the driver never showed. We ended up getting a ride by a mysterious guy who drives a car with no cab markings named \"Mr. C\" or something. Last weekend we were in the process of waiting over an hour when I decided to download the Lyft application. I had a ride lined up, an ETA and an actual conversation with the driver within minutes.
