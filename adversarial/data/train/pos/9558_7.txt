I popped in today for my first time after dreaming about corned beef sandwiches for months. \n\nAnd I was sort of disappointed.\n\nWhile the staff were really nice, the food quality just wasn't there. The corned beef was really soft and almost slimy. And for $10, the quantity wasn't there either. I mean, you go to... even Pickle Barrel, and you'll get a healthy (heh heh heh) amount of food placed in front of you. Here, though... for $10, you get a pretty small sandwich and a solo pickle wrapped up (kind of lazily) in some saran wrap.\n\nOverall? I might go again, but definitely not for the $10 meat sandwich. They have salads and soups which might be worth while? Oh. And what took it from a 2\/5 to a 3\/5? One of the staff says \"beauty\" after everything you say.\n\n\"Mustard?\" \"Yes, please.\" \"Beauty.\"\n\n\"White or brown?\" \"Brown.\" \"Beauty.\"\n\n\"Drink with that?\" \"No, thank you.\" \"BEAUTY.\"
