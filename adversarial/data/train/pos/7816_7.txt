This is your typical Chinese bakery with packaged goodies and baked egg tarts on glass display.  \n\nThe place is a bit of a downer - with a lot of empty space and plain walls.  There is seating, but the time I went, there was no one in there.  But I had to try out their egg tarts... because if you know me, I love egg tarts.  I came here for some of the savory goodies as well.  Everything was alright.  Not out of this world, but it gave my craving a good calm.
