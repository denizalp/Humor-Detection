Proper management techniques teach us to provide critical feedback by starting with the good stuff: in this case a lovely room and wonderful service - and moving to the not so good [frequently referred to as 'opportunities'.] In this case, it is what it is.  Great for the vegan\/veg crowd and I described it to the lovely as eating grass. Another yelper did brilliantly to describe it as organic in a blah blah blah kind of way. \n\nAfter sharing the trough of vegetable crudites, I had the panang curry which was a large portion - lots of veggies and about 5 shrimp - but it was flavorful and yummy, served piping hot. The friendy friends both had salmon with kale which looked interesting but not really flavorful. I get it. They love it.  And me? I know I need to eat more veggies but that's not why I go out to dinner - I want deliciousness. And this was good, not my wheel house but good. \n\nAnd did someone here say there's real food for non vegetarians? If I brought the lovely here? Yah, no. We'd be marching down the sidewalk to Capital Grille. Don't fight it kids, it is what it is. And that's for a pretty focused audience.\n\nFinal props to waiter Adam - wonderful server, kind person and all around good sport.
