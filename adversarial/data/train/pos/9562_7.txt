As close to authentic Korean as you can get in Madison. They do several dishes really well, especially homey Korean staples such as the bimbimbop (make sure to get it in the hot stone bowl), bulgogi, Doenjang-jjigae (fermented soybean paste stews), dubbokki (gluttonous rice cakes and fish cake in chili paste), and Gimbop (Korean sushi rolls).\n\nThe best part is that their banchan are free! \n\nThis is our first choice for Korean. \n\nClosed on Sundays. Be prepared to wait during peak dining hours, the space is small and fills up quickly.
