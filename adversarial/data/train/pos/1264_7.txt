So this was my second time at Rubs and the meal was tastier this time around with the pulled pork sandwich. I tried the ribs and Mac and cheese the first time and I wasn't very impressed, maybe I just have high standards? I thought the ribs were a bit dry but I'm also used to baby back ribs fall off the bone type which is not the case at Rubs I also like sharp cheese in my M&C and thought it was a bit too bland and \"liquidy\" to my liking. Service is always nice, friendly and quick however it wasn't busy so I don't know how it is on Saturday nights. The Pulled pork sandwich was really juicy and bursting with flavor but I wasn't really into the coleslaw, I usually like mine with a vinegary kick and I kept craving pickles with this sandwich for some reason. Overall I would go back for this sandwich and ask for pickles and try different sides. Worth a visit that's for sure !
