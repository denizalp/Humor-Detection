Found on Yelp!  Located this place right near downtown Belmont and have visited a few times.   I find this place to be well priced and the quality of the food is great as well.  The staff is friendly and helpful if you look to be a \"newby.\"\n\nTakeout: Parking is so close to the door.  And all the packaging is biodegradable containers and silverware.  #enviornment!  I placed a phone order for 1 person, and they said it would be ready in 5 minutes.  Can't beat that timing, couldn't drive there quick enough!\n\nBrunch\/Breakfast: Great selection, and the portions are very generous to fill you up for breakfast and lunch combined!  It gets pretty busy in there, but there still seemed to be enough tables for the line even at the longest point.\n\nDinner: I found it is usually a bit slower in the evenings from a few trips, which makes it very quick to order and get your food.  I had the special item, which should be added to the regular menu!  It was a Havana type cuban sandwich... I can still remember the taste of it.\n\nIf you haven't tried this yet, definitely make a quick trip there.  Likely won't be disappointed!
