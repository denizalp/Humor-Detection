I called about 15 minutes prior to going in and they were able to take me and my girlfriend.  The place was quiet and there was hardly anyone when we went.  Bathroom was clean and the massage room was what you would expect.  The prices were reasonable so I would go again.\n\nBtw, this is a legit spa - no weird stuff.
