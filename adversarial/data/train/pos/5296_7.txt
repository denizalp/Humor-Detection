First off , I have never gotten out of that restaurant without paying at least $30. WIth a family of four , around $80+ not including drinks. The food is okay if you like a slice of pizza that is mainly made up of sauce and bread with barely any cheese or toppings.So much sauce , it was like soup! Then to top off the crappy food was the staff. It is 100+ degrees outside and they had a problem with us wearing shorts and flip flops. But hey they still let us in. Maybe the reason our food was crappy was because they didn't like our clothes. Until things change , I won't be wasting any more money here.\n\nI suggest that if this restaurant wants to survive , they need to re think their menu , and straighten up the employees attitudes , big time.\n\nAnd to everyone else who put more than 3 stars on your review , either you don't have tastebuds , or you got paid to do your review.
