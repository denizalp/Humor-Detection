I really cant stand Walmart. I really cant stand that I had to shop here. Just makes me so mad, and disappointed. I was in this part of town and on my way to a party and I wanted to pick up flowers and some kind of veggie tray. Both selections were lacking. Flowers looked horrible. I got the \"best\" of what they had, but man, they were seriously horrible. I was embarrassed to give them. Do I show up as a dirtbag with no gift? Or do I bring lame looking flowers? Either way, I suck! The store was eh, and the people including the clientele were lame. Ugh, I really dislike Walmart.
