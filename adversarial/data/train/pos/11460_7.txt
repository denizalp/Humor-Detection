I had to leave a 5 star review for two reasons:\n\n1.) Johnny Vegas gave both my friends the EXACT tattoo they wanted and he did a bad ass job! NUFF SAID! I was impressed!!!!!! (His portfolio did not have too many flowers if he even had any, but he rocked the shit out of the two he did that night we went!!)\n\n2.) Johnny Vegas is HOT! LMAO! As I watched both of my friends get their tattoos, I just found sooo many HOT things about him! He was very cool, very talented and HOT! LMAO! LMAO!!!\n\nIf I had enough balls to get a tattoo and figured out what I would get, I would definitely consider JOHNNY VEGAS!!! Only in Vegas can a Vegas give you a tattoo at midnight til 2am with no appointment!! LOVE IT!
