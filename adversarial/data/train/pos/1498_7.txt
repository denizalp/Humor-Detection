So me and my fianc√© just decided to go here for dinner. When we walked in a random lady gave us a stare as if we had poop  on our faces. Not only, this was some of the worst services I ever have had. We were seated for 10 plus minutes without anyone greeting us. I started to count how many waitresses walked by us, 8. We waited another 5 minutes, still no service at all. We politely got up, spoke to a manager, and left. 15 minutes when you're hungry\/hangry is an eternity. Not sure if it was due to us being a gay couple or a black couple because there were not busy by far. As well as there were many servers on the floor. So, your staffed, it's not busy, I see many others getting greeted, food\/drinks delivered while we sat hangry and parched. Anyway it goes piss poor service.
