After trying their horse meat tartar, my boyfriend had been raving about this place for a long time, and we finally went this past weekened.  He warned me that there was a chance we would have to wait for a while, and was he ever right. There was an hour and a half wait time. \n\nJennifer Agg, the owner, took down my name and number and called me exactly after an hour and a half. In the meantime, we went to get a drink across the street at cocktail bar. It seemed like the norm....When we went back to the Black hoof, unfortunately, we were only able to get two seats by the bar. Good thing i'm not claustrophobic. It didn't end up being that bad and the bartender was so helpful and on top of his game! We each got wine--i obviously had to go with the Gewurztraminer. \n\nThere are no menus, it is however all written on their blackboard. We started with olives that were served warm. We also ordered the charcuterie board, the fois gras mousse, the riccota and tomato agnolotti, the pork tacos and the tuna crudo. I loved the fois gras mousse. I had never seen it served wtih a white coating (i'm guessing it was butter but I am not quite sure.) The charcuterie board was also a highlight with a variety of different meats that varied in hotness. The pasta was amazing and the tomatoes so fresh. I also enjoyed the pork tacos, however, my least favorite dish was the tuna crudo because i could still taste the ice and it was wayy too fishy. After indulging in all these rich foods, we went ahead and both got two different kinds of port. I had the madeira, which came in a cute little crystal glass and it was really good. \n\nI know this is supposed to be the best tapas place in Toronto, but I'm going to go ahead and say it--I love Cava more.
