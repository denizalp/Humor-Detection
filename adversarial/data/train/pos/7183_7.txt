Ohhhh Juliette et Chocolat! What's not to love about your chocolately goodness? If you're in town you simply MUST make a stop at this Montreal institution. This particular location is nice because its so much bigger than the others throughout the city. Its really spacious with lots of tables and the line-up goes faster than others! I remember, a few years ago now, this place used to be a supper club-nightclub type place and the transformation is crazy! You now feel like you're in a quaint little bakery shop! The service is always pretty good, if non-descript. Nothing to write home about but never awful either. \n\nThe real attraction is the FOOD though, my gawwd its good. I always order the Chocolat fondant or Caramel fondant--like a lava-cake with delicious filling ooozzing out with the best vanilla ice cream you've ever tasted served on the side. You might get it and think 'gee, that's pretty small,' but looks are deceiving. I'm always full after eating it--its rich but delicious! You can't go wrong either with any of the brownies. The 'fleur de sel' is particularly good (it is Quebec after all!) and pair it with a scoop of ice cream and you've got the perfect treat! If you go, you simply must have a hot chocolate. The hot chocolate is not the powered crap you buy from a grocery store--or even a coffee shop, these days--but rather legitimate chocolate melted down and mixed with hot milk. They also offer some savoury crepes and while I've personally never ordered one everyone who has tells me they're also very good. If you don't have a lot of time--but want to experience the Juliette experience--they offer all of their brownies to go and you can simply order with the hostess at the stand with the till\/cash register. \n\nGo! You won't regret it!
