Yes!!! This is the ONLY casino that I've seen where you can put in coins to play and win coins too! I liked that and I felt like I was doing old Vegas and whatnot! \nThe gimmicky thing was the coin and stuff but the food too but I love fried oreos, twinkies, half pound hot dogs and other food that can kill you with grease. \nThe only thing that can be eh is that it looks and feels REAL dirty and old inside and you have to pay for a small cup of water. \nWould I go back? Eh maybe but it'll probably be for the fried heart attack food when I want a cheap snack but I'd leave right after
