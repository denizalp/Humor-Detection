ugh, this place. \n\ni had an ex-boyfriend who loved this restaurant, so i've eaten here more times than i can count-and let me tell you, this place sucks. straight up. it's gross and dirty inside and the servers always seem like they've got something better to do.\n\ni don't know how this is even a thing, but the chips are always, and i mean always, stale. they have this terrible rubbery taste and the salsa has no flavor.  chips and salsa are kind of my thing, so if you can't get that right it really sours me.\n\nas for food authenticity? no way are you getting that here. they use cheap meat that tastes like it's cooked in a microwave and looks like it too. they claim their chile relleno is \"famous\", but good god have they butchered it.  if you're eating here and you see a puffed up dish that looks like brains going by, there it is. ugh.  \n\ni really don't understand why this place is so popular when they have such awful food-you could get a better meal at taco bell. oh, and president bush loves it, so that should tell you everything you need to know.
