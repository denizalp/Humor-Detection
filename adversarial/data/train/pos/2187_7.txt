Where to begin with this review?  As a wee lil girl we came here all of the time.  My memories don't match the now giant, sprawling, lush zoo that is now here.  Not only is it huge, it's massively expensive.  Of course I footed the bill for my entire extended family.\n\nWe needed a wheel chair for my aunt, who was ill at the time.  That was another added cost.  But you do get some money off by returning it before your rental time ends.  Thankfully my mom paid for that.\n\nThe first sight was the Asian Elephant.  There was only one to be seen.  They are really furry!  Much more furry than the African Elephants in Oakland. \n\nWe meandered around and also saw Ducks, Pelicans, the Bald Eagle, a Black Swan and Barn Owls.\n\nThen we landed in the petting zoo.  My zoo map accidentally blew in from the outside wall and a Goat tried eating it.  One of the volunteers was very upset.  It was an accident.  Calm down.\n\nMy grandma had the bag with our lunches we packed and few goats started to try to get my grandma too.  I know goats are said to eat anything.  But meatloaf sandwiches?\n\nOne of my favorite creatures was the 600lb, 90 year old Tortoise.  One of the keepers was there and had him stand up tall on all four legs.  A Tortoise of that magnitude is a creature to behold.  \n\nWe saw some Bears swimming in their pond.  The otters were all out frolicking as well.\n\nThe Lions were visible, but sleeping.  The Tiger was the biggest one I've ever seen.  I got incredibly uncomfortable when a little boy near us started screaming at it.  You know that whole story about the Tiger from the San Francisco zoo jumping out of the cage for being taunted.  Of course his parents didn't stop him.  Why would they? \n\nThe Wolf was hiding.  The Cheetah and the Painted African Dogs were barely visible.  Thankfully I brought my telephoto lens.\n\nWe wanted to ride the Camels but the line was too long.  I have a picture if myself at 6 with my cousin riding them in the 80's.  I really wanted to do it again, but this time with my son. \n\nBring your own lunch and snacks.  We did and ate at a lovely covered picnic table near the Tigers cage.  I don't know if eating meat loaf sandwiches is a good thing to eat near a tiger cage?  We did it anyway.\n\nWhere the giraffes and other African Savannah animals are is huge too.  Plenty of platforms and railing to overlook them too.\n\nI had an awesome time.  We even missed a whole other portion of the zoo.  Great!  That means I'll have to come back.
