This Subway is located inside the Love's Travel Stop. I stop here once or twice a week when I am headed to Mesquite, Pioche, or anywhere in Utah I am going for work. This Subway can be busy depending on what time of day it is. The line moves quickly and the Godfather's Pizza is literally right next to Subway so you can have both or options. The register at Subway can take purchases for Godfather's too but don't try the regular register inside the convenient store because they aren't allowed to ring them up. Since this location is busy they do run out of certain breads but are always making more. The Cold Cut Combo is my sub of choice and it was satisfying. I did find the cookies to be flatter and not as good however I only tried them once and maybe it was an off day. If you don't want to take your food with you they have plenty of tables inside to sit at.
