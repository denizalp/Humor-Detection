You can get your car washed here for $3 or $6 or you can pay more, depending on the services you want.\n\nFor $3 you will get the dust off your car and it will look great. \n\nFor $6 they will hand dry your car and it will also look great.\n\nThis is quite a large operation squeezed into the back corner of a busy shopping area right next to In 'n Out Burger so it is always busy here. The most difficult part of getting your car washed is deciding which lane to drive into.\n\nI am only reviewing the express car wash and have no experience with the more extensive and expensive car detailing that they offer. However, judging by the number of employees and the lines of cars, they must be doing something right.
