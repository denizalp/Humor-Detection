Mind the dress code if you'd like to sit on the patio. I had the potato leek soup which had a nice presentation but I fully believe the potatoes were of the frozen bagged nature (thumbs down). At the urging of our painfully slow waiter my group of 5 ordered the family style surf and turf. We choose the Maine lobster, tomahawk steak, king crab mac n' cheese and black truffle creamed spinach as sides.\n\nLobster - decent. Didn't try any of the 3 butters since I prefer only lemon on my lobster. \nSteak - fine to decent. Since most of my party preferred their steak midrare most of the meat was undercooked for my liking.  The cipollini onions were delightful. \nMac n cheese - did not like the seasoning\nCreamed spinach - meh, again the seasoning\nIced tea - tasted like the smell of a fresh opened bandaid, totally weird.\nI would be hard pressed to choose this restaurant again in a city packed with amazing dining options.
