Another fantastic omakase dinner and this one is in Henderson to boot??  Damn, double damn, triple damn!!  Chef Hiro sent our group on a voyage of delicious oceanic treats that had taste buds swooning and eyes bulging.  His attention to detail and cool presentation was a revelation that has my stomach yearning to return like a kid to Disney World. \n\nIf you're not a picky eater and don't mind missing out on cream cheese for your Japanese dinner, letting the chef do his thing is definitely the way to go.  They know what is freshest that day and the element of surprise makes the meal more fun than the Criss Angel show. That's not a high bar to exceed, still......  \n\nBeing a self-professed tuna fiend, the first plate of big eye, akami and chutoro had me giddier than my sister in law at a New Kids on the Block concert.  The first mouthful of the medium fatty tuna sent me into sushi bliss and was an ideal way to kick off dinner.\n\nOther exceptional nigiri pieces included the incredible cut of hamachi, the oyster whose plumpness and juiciness was greatly accentuated by the Chef steaming it with sake for fifteen minutes, and the homemade uber-tender tako.  Last but not least, Chef Hiro's \"Saba Five Ways\" was an absolute delight.  Each piece of mackerel was of different origin and taste and all supremely oishiiiiiiiii!  Goddamn!!! I want all my food to be served 5 ways!\n\nI'll be at Denny's all like \"Sir? I'll take bacon, but I want it 5 ways. I'll take a side of eggs, 5 ways as well, and please send over the sommelier, I have 5 questions.\"\n \n$80 got me 18 pieces of sushi (including otoro currently at $14 a piece), 2 unbelievably fresh oysters, a spoonful of awesome uni and dessert.  I would gladly shell out for this again and again and again.
