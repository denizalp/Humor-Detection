Wish I could give zero stars!!! The service is HORRIBLE! My husband and I are planning to purchase a Travel Trailer but have no idea where to begin....length? How many people does it sleep? What are the different features? The guy that was showing us the various trailers was super rude. He rushed through the information as if WE were keeping him from something else! I believe he thought we weren't real customers....\nBy the time we got to the 3rd trailer to look at it I was done and ready to leave! I think his name was Troy but whatever the case, he was a total a**hole! I refuse to come back! Kick rocks!
