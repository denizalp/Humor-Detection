Been here countless times. Granted not recently however this place never changes. \n\nAlso, how you view this place will depend whether you are a Spanish, dancing person or not. No offense but it is the truth. \n\nIf you come here for the food or the overpriced bottled beer then you are coming for the wrong reasons. There is nothing this place --even with the nice decour, that other dance clubs will not be better at. Except for the extreme accessibility due to its excellent central location in Yorkville. \n\nGenerally speaking, this is where the non-Spanish crowd come to dance. Not to say that Spanish people don't come here, I mean, I used to come here for many years but the main draw, as I said before, was it's accessibility and maybe bachata Thursdays. However if you really want to dance some serious bachata, you are better off coming with a partner. Since true bachata is fairly intimate and other dancer might feel uncomfortable with the intimacy. Maybe...\n\nIf you are a dancer, then avoid the Friday\/Saturday night combo as they are known as the \"pick up nights.\" This place gets way too packed and you can't really dance unless you enjoy bumping into people for most of the night. If you are a girl, expect to be hit on fairly frequently. \n\nIf you like to dance salsa then you will want to come on Wednesdays and Thursday nights, otherwise known as \"dancing nights.\" These are the nights where most of the non-dancers or pick up artists tend to stay away and only people who are really committed to dance come out. \n\nThursdays are know as \"show off nights,\" you can still dance but be prepared to see many very advanced couples take to the floor.  They are great to watch but there is a vibe of exclusivity which scares the non-initiated. It can still be fun though.\n\nAs you can imagine during these two nights, bar traffic is fairly minimal and thus the club will try to make money by charging cover... sometimes.. Oddly there are times where they do not. When they did, I always used to think it was because they wanted to make sure they made the rent at the end of the month! ;-)\n\nThe free classes are okay and are a draw for people who are starting but don't think much about them as they are nothing more than tasters, so do not expect to know how to dance by the end of the hour and unless you are a good looking woman you probably won't be asked to dance. Well, the truth is that if you are a man, you probably won't be asked to dance due to the culture expectations anyway. \n\nHence you get a bunch of men just making a circle outside the dance floor looking in... longingly. \n\nIf you are a man and you can't dance then I would suggest to go elsewhere because even if you ask a regular out, chances are they will figure you out very quickly and excuse themselves the moment the beat stops as they will be looking for a more advanced dance partner. \n\nIf you are Latin and you know how to dance then this place is not bad and it is a great place to become a part of a community as you will get to know a lot of people by cheer exposure. \n\nHaving said that, all in all, the club is just okay as there are better places to dance, like Lula Lounge for example which tends to have better music. However you still can't beat Babaluu's central location. \n\nIf you need to get your Salsa fix, this place will do.
