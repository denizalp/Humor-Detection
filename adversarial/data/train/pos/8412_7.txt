The short story: overcooked, dried out burger, oversalted fries and boring salad. What's there to like?\n\nI gave this other place another try for a late lunch - I got there at 2:30pm, there was maybe a half a dozen customers around. I'd said I'd rather sit on a chair than in a booth, I was given a chair .... in a corner, facing the wall, in an empty restaurant.\n\nThis seems to be the norm in Charlotte and I decided not to worry about it.  All I wanted was a medium rare burger w\/ bacon (no cheese) and fries. The waitress says they don't do MR, only medium and I decided to leave. The waitress ran to the kitchen and confirmed that they will accommodate my order. \n\nOK, three or four very annoying Dolly Parton songs (I think) later the burger arrives. I gave it one bite and a chunk of dried out ground beef fell out. Sure enough the burger was not MR, M or even MW it was simply well done, as in FU. \nZero stars\n\nWaiting for the waitress to return I had some of the fries but in spite of my hunger I had to stop because they were waaaay too salty, way more than last time and way more that is healthy.  \nOne star\n\nWaitress came, said \"that's not m.r.\" then sent over the manager who asked what I wanted to do. Told her I didn't trust the guy to cook me another burger and I ordered the flat iron steak instead. She also agreed to replace my fries with a house salad with a so called balsamic vinaigrette.  \n \nThe salad arrives almost immediately and it's ... nothing but tasteless and without interest. I can't believe they would serve a salad like this alongside a $30 steak, it belonged in family restaurant, a cheap one at that. \n\nThe steak had a pink center (medium) and again rubbed with the pepper sauce which no one asked me about. I ate, paid and left. What can I say about a steakhouse that can't prepare the meat, the salad or the fries right other than \"no thanks\"?\n\nI still had a $25 gift certificate from corporate for the last fiasco that I was saving for a dinner but I chose to give it away rather than eating here ever again.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n4\/17 Edit: Longhorn corporate doesn't bother to contact disgruntled customers anymore than their restaurants do.
