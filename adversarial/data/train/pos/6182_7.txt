How am I the first person to review this place?! Seriously? They sell FUDGE by the HALF POUND. It is a yelper's dream. They make it in the shop - you'll see it as you walk by - and the smell is everywhere. Ask the folks about it, they aren't shy. Very chatty, actually. And try some samples too!\n\nI bought a slab of the Cookies N Cream fudge, and carried it around with me all night. This morning there is still some left over for breakfast. Mmmmm fudge for breakfast.
