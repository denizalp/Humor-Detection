For the price you pay, you're really not getting a lot. My partner and I ordered two meat dishes: pork shoulder butt and beef skirt steak. You get about 3 pieces of pork and 10 slices of beef. It comes with your usual ban chan (side dishes) like kimchi and marinated white radish, plus steamed egg soup and a tofu soup. The lettuce they served us wasn't too fresh so beware. \n\nI'm docking stars because the whole time we were there, we felt like the servers kept rushing us to finish eating. They were super quick to take away empty plates, sometimes when we hadn't even finished them yet. Also the place is super small so they want quick turnaround for customers waiting to be seated.\n\nWhile this is a cool place, I will not be returning because of the poor service and overpriced items. Luckily Toronto has tons of authentic KBBQ places just a few blocks away.
