This place is like a 4th round draft pick who starts for your team for 6 years, he's solid,  there is better out there but he is such a good value, why look elsewhere?\n\nHe didn't have the best combine, and doesn't look the part, but he's a gamer and when you need him to be a reliable cog in your machine he's there.\n\nAfter his initial 4 year deal, you re-upped him for 2 more for a little more money, but he's really plateaued this last year, so you let him go, bring in some young flashy kid, and yeah he might make some big plays, but he'll mess up some easy ones. \n\nIf you want a consistent addition to your team, for value that cannot be beat, draft Cafe Cortez, which honestly wouldn't be that bad of a name. Picture him; dread locks, playing DB, always around the ball. Haha. \n\nTry it, its solid. Get the special.
