My wife and I had been racking our brains to try and figure out a good activity in which our three year old daughter could get involved.  We thought about dance. We contemplated martial arts. We couldn't decide on either. \n\nSo, instead, we picked both! \n\nWe searched the internet for different capoeira locations. Most of the sites said that the activity was more suited for children four and up. Capoeira Brasil said that children would be taken on a case by case basis. So, we decided to see if our daughter was up to the task. \n\nThe first instructor we met was Mr. Fogo. He was very patient with Mackenzie. He put her through some basic moves, stretches, etc. Mackenzie LOVED it!\n\nUltimately, they said that she could keep coming back for classes if she wanted to. They also mentioned that they were just really restarting the children's program. So, for a few months, it was one-on-one instruction. What a fantastic learning opportunity!\n\nIt has been 6 months since we starded bringing Mac to capoeira classes. She has shown amazing improvement thanks to the wonderful instructors at the school. \n\nMy wife and I are confident that we have begun our daughter down the pathway to a healthy and exciting life because of her instruction at Capoeira Brasil Tempe!
