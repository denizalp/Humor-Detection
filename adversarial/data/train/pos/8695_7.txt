I love habachi! Tonight was my first time trying Wasabi for a good friend's birthday. The food was amazing! The server was efficient and never let our glasses get 1\/3 empty. The chef was very skilled but very foul mouthed. He must've only had sex on his mind because even having 4 young children at the table did NOT deter him from making numerous inappropriate, sexual innuendoes right in their presence. He didn't quite get the hint when no one laughed but instead made a comment about it being a \"tough crowd\" and then followed it with a swear word. Telling the birthday girl in front of her children and husband that \"even though they just met, she can still blow\" left my mouth on the floor. There were many more tasteless jokes that I will spare you from. If you plan on going here, think twice about going as a family with children. I know I won't be taking my kids there.
