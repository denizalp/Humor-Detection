Great crowd, diversity and I'm not talking about the boat.  Ordered a Corona with grenadine n the whores flocked. I'm starting to like Phoenix . \n\nOn so apparently don't be black in here tho. I got kicked out for literally nothing, it's crazy. They claimed I spilled someone's drink, I even offered to buy the person another drunk but they weren't going for it. Go figure right. Fuck this bar .
