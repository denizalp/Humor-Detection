Oh Target, I have such a love\/hate relationship with you. You are a black hole of consumer goods. I walk in for toothpaste, somehow seemingly black out and walk out with $100 of stuff... only to return home and realize I forgot to get toothpaste. \n\nThis location is super clean, well staffed, organized and the shelves stocked with all your necessities... and not-so-necessary items. The addition of the grocery area is nice. Running errands can now be a one-stop shopping excursion.. rather than multiple stops all over town. A Starbucks greets you when you walk in, so you can get your caffeine fix before hitting the aisles. They are also really good about returning items. \n\nThe parking garage can be kind of chaotic. I recommend skipping the 3rd floor (where everyone fights for spots) and head to another level. Target is simply a quick elevator ride away... and you don't have to drive around in circles playing parking spot roulette. \n\nFor those with no willpower like myself-- make a list and skip the cart. My rule is to get a basket and leave when it is full. :)
