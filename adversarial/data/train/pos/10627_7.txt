This is my favorite restaurant within a 1-2 mile radius of CMU campus. In fact, the menu is taped on my wall above my desk in my dorm room. I typically get the hot and spicy wonton noodles or Dan Dan noodles. Today, I ordered the Shrimp, Pork, Vegetable Wontons and was not disappointed. It was fairly spicy but the flavors are authentic and, as with all other items on the menu, the handmade noodles are a wonderful touch. The waiting times on weekends tend to be a little longer but when I went on Thursday night, I was immediately seated and received my food quite promptly. If I had to eat these noodles everyday I would not be mad.
