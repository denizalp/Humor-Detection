Love this place BUT because I love it so much  I have to write this review of my favorite desert in Phoenix. \n\nI have been here numerous times and spent hundreds over time. However, for the love of their food I don't understand why they can't be consistent on their Banoffi pie. It's always, I mean always, different. We take food out 99% of the time and it's always a hit or miss. Sometimes the bananas are black, sometimes they are soggy, sometimes the crust is thin as paper, sometimes there is so much crust you feel you are eating sand, sometimes the caramel sauce is invisible and sometimes there is so little there that you just want to cry. I crave their Banoffi on a daily basis but absolutely hate when I drive 30 min for it and when I get home is a disappointment. PLEASEEEEE I mean PLEASE get your portions down on your banoffis!
