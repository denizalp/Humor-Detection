Not the worse place to rent from in Madison, not the best either. I rented from MPM for two years, different places each year but same building. We had to move all our stuff to the street in between so we waited for the day with our stuff. Some cleaners came to clean and were out in 5 minutes.. they said \"Looks like someone already cleaned\" (yeah, us!). We still got charged for two hours of cleaning! The next year we got charged nothing though, and our dog had pissed all over the carpet, so who knows! One big complaint is a cleaning lady who cleaned mutual spaces left a key in our door that had a key to our apartment, and it was there all weekend until I returned home. I had to call the police to have them search my apartment because I was scared. When I called to complained I got an apology and a request for the keys back. I didn't send them back, instead I got an extra pair of keys for my trouble. All in all not terrible, a bit expensive but clean apartments.
