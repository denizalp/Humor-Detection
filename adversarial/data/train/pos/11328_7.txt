I'm impressed! We went around 11pm at night and the atmosphere was great. There was a live band playing! And our waiter was super nice. We ordered a few pizzas but the best one is... one that I cannot pronounce. lol. I just know it has prosciutto in it and other meats. I also added anchovies in there as well. Delicious!\n\nThe board we ordered was nice too. Got to stir up our appetite with the wine. Overall, the outdoor patio experience was pretty. It was chill and relaxed. I want to come back and try the other food as well. Or stick to the ones we had because our pizzas and appetizers were really good.
