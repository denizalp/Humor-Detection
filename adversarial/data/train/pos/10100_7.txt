Great show!\n\nI've never actually seen Terry Fator before, even clips on TV. Yes, I'm definitely not up-to-date with my current TV, I admit it. When my out-of-town guests mentioned how great he was, we decided he would be a good choice for their Las Vegas show. He was a great choice!\n\nWe saw his holiday show, where he did more singing and impersonating of celebrities than just comedy jokes with his puppets. Terry Fator is incredibly talented. His singing is better than most singers, he's funny, AND he is a ventriloquist! Amazing. \n\nYou won't be disappointed with Terry Fator. Now, I know why he has a great following. If you're looking for a great show, this one is it. \n\nTip: Book early. Tickets start at $59.99, but they go fast.
