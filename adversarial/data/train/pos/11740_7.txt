They have now expanded the place. WOW. There is SO much room!\n\nThe staff nicer than I last remembered, welcomed us and sat us at the new section. It hasn't fully constructed but a few tables\/chairs is al you really require when all you want to do is play some board games. \n\nMy buddy & I played 'Apples on Apples' & ' Pictureuka! ' \nreally cute thing I noted. They had zoo animals on each table (only at the new section). I must say, tis a unique way of table organization. \nWe had the ass. ( as in Donkey). Go figure. \n\n\nxoxo\nM.
