I give this place a 3.5 star.  I came here Sunday evening and it wasn't busy at all.  Maybe 5 tables were occupied at most.  Waiter was friendly and very attentive.\n\nThe food I must say was average.  Found this place through Yelp and read all the great reviews and saw all the amazing photos.  To be honest I think this place was hyped way too much.  We had ordered Mac n Cheese Eggrolls, Smoked Cheddar and Creole Crab Dip, and got the Thai Fighter to share.\n\nMac n Cheese Eggrolls was nothing special.  It was a little dry, and it did lack that creamy-ness, and cheesy-ness a Mac n Cheese should have.  The Smoked Cheddar and Creole Dip was average nothing I haven't tasted before.  However, I did enjoy the homemade chips they used instead of bread.  Thai Fighter is J. Red's signature dish and I did not see anything signature about it.  I mean it was good but again, it was nothing special.  I've had and tasted better.  I should've gotten the Chicken and Waffle dish instead but decided against it as everyone seemed to like the Thai Fighter so I thought I'd give it a go and see what all the rave was about.  Totally regret that decision.  Also, the Thai Fighter says it's spicy on the menu...it is not spicy at all, maybe a little tingle on the tongue but nothing more.  Trust me, take it from someone who can't handle eating super spicy foods.\n\nOverall, I don't think I'll be coming back anytime soon.  It was a good experience but the food wasn't memorable enough for me to return.
