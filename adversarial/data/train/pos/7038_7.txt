ATTN; OWNER\/MANAGER opened just a couple months - You might want to take a good look at your staff and wonder why your not busy!!!! Living across the street in Seville we thought we would try your NEW location early afternoon (NOT) busy at all, but with 2 stylist who were working on customers...\"Guessing they can't handle the stress of more customers\" Yelling across the room \"we'll be with you in a minute\"...Hey we got that been customers at Great Clips Salon for over 10 years and never heard anyone Yell out loud that rudely before...totally taken back by this rude stylist.  \n\nThe sarcastic girl came to counter and couldn't be more rude to a new customer\" She kept on getting the name wrong and getting more aggravated because my sister corrected her -  (or I should say potential customer !!!) She was so rude that we sat down\", left shortly after and so did 2 people behind us.\n\nOne guy saying \"I'm not going to put up with this either\" and left, All of us were absolutely treated like our business was not wanted????
