I can't help but describe this as the Canadian twin to New York's own Flushing Meadows - Corona Park. and I mean that in a good way!\n\nboth were developed for a World's Fair (Expo 67, just 3 years after NYC's), are a short walk from a subway line, are fairly well-maintained, and host to all sorts of events and activities that go above and beyond their original purpose.\n\nare you a history buff? go to the Stewart Museum.\n\nwant to burn some calories off your fat ass after eating too much poutine? go swimming, hiking, biking, and more.\n\nlike environmental sciences? visit the Biosphere.\n\nmusic fan? see a concert here. in fact, they were setting up for the Heavy MTL festival when we walked past (kinda wish I had gotten tickets but they were sold out by then) the outdoor concert field. Iron Maiden and Metallica have both played here -FUC yeah!\n\ninto amusement parks? La Ronde (owned by Six Flags) is right there.\n\nthis is a great park with something for everyone and kinda makes you forget you are in the hustle and bustle of a city!
