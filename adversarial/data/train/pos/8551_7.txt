Stayed here the first two nights in Vegas and even though the room layout I had was nice and pampering there were just too many other critical details that I couldn't overlook staying at the Encore. First of all your cell reception will be non existent in your room or hallways of this hotel. Dropped calls, spotty internet connection, and all missed calls. And the WiFi that they provide in your room...a complete and utter joke! It will not work throughly throughout your suite so you better be comfortable hanging out next to your room's window to get your WiFi on! And unless you get the reserve rate on your room you better get used to paying like $16 bucks for WiFi. Can't remember if that's a daily charge rate or good throughout your stay. And when we asked about possibly moving to a new room to so that we pull better reception because we were in town on business and needed to be able to make and receive calls the front desk was a little condescending and not willing to initially emphasize with our situation or resolve the matter amiably. \n\nAnd the A\/C...umm what A\/C?!? Your room will be hot as hell because all their A\/C blows is dust and particles and is completely stuffed up...and thus no cool air coming in through their clog up vents! It was was so bad the first night a massive allergy attack and needed some Claritin D just to make it through the night and stop sneezing. \n\nAfter that me and my boys had to bounce and find a new hotel on Strip...and I'm much happier that we did. My review for this spot on the strip to follow soon. To wrap The Encore may appear to be luxurious but there could be some hidden red flags on your stay so just be prepared to withstand it or bounce and find better accommodations.
