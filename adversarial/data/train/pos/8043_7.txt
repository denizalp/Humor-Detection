I really liked this place! Looks great and the food tastes great too! All I got the first time I went was egg drop soup and chicken lettuce wraps and I felt like they were both delicious. The lettuce wraps, to me, were better than Pei Wei. Not to dry and full of flavor. Cheap prices. I will definitely be back!
