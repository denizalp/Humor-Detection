The club itself and the music is definitely 5 stars. It's a great atmosphere with great music. My reason for only giving it 2 stars is because of the bouncers. They are ridiculously RUDE!!! I have never in my life been so disrespected or treated so poorly from a bouncer of a club that I paid $80 to get into. Doing your job, controlling the crowds, and making it a safe place is not the same as just being a total asshole to guests. \n\nNot sure if I will ever come back to XS, but if I do, it'll only be because of the music....NOT the awful staff there.
