I'll be honest, I was curious about the poop theme which lead us to this dessert place one night.  If you've ever heard the phrase \"curiosity killed the cat\", then this dessert place definitely killed my experience. \n\nWe went as a group of two and waited for about 15 mins. While waiting we took cute photos of me sitting on a toilet, surrounded by poop paraphernalia.  Service was busy, and the waiters look mildly frazzled. We were also looking at other Yelp reviews, and the negative reviews were making us reconsider waiting. However, we decided to give it a try. \n\nWe ordered the Nutella poop waffle, and the sesame bing su. The prices were kinda outstandish.  Both dishes were served in a bathtub, and our order came relatively quick. Our Nutella poop waffle ($3) legit looked like poop. It was a cartoon shaped poop with Nutella slabbed on top. Man, was that thing stale. The only thing worth eating was the Nutella. No wonder it was so quick, because it was already premade. The bing su was good, but the price exorbitant ($9.50). \n\nWhen we went to pay, our order amount was precalculated and written on a post it note. Cash only. They have a cash register, but choose to use a calculator to pay instead. I use post it notes to write notes, or send love notes... not use it as a form of receipt. \n\nOverall, very tacky furniture and decor, as well as underwhelming dessert. The washroom for some reason had a long wait, I'm unsure why. I hear it may be very instagramable.
