I love steak like any non-vegetarian citizen of the US of A and have a list of favorites including The Golden Steer and Delmonico's to name a few, but when I'm feeling absolutely baller and want the best quality in both service and food, I come to Del Frisco's.\n\n\nSTEAKAGE:\nThe menu here features the standards like filet mignon, ribeye, porterhouse, etc. which is all fine and dandy but when I come here, I specifically want their specials.  Dishes that aren't offered at your typical steakhouse, such as:\n\nDouble eagle bone-in prime strip (contrary to popular belief, this is not made with two eagles...it's made with three), bone in filet mignon, the filet mignon trio, or my personal favorite:\n\n32-oz WAGYU RIBEYE with tomahawk bone.  To put it in perspective of how amazing this steak is, I will make a list titled \"News I Never Want to Hear\" (in order):\n\n1. Del Frisco's no longer serves the wagyu rib-eye\n2. Zooey Deschanel and Ben Gibbard happily back together!\n3. Liam Neeson furious with Michael O's Yelp review of Fresh Brothers pizza.  \"I will find him,\" swears the terrifying actor.\n\n\nSIDE DISHES:\n1. Cream spinach:\n2. Lobster mac & cheese\n3. Chateau potatoes: I love potatoes in all its forms - mashed, baked, roasted, fried, you name it.  Chateau potatoes are basically upgraded seasoned\/buttery mashed potatoes with scallions & pepper.\n\n\nTIPS:\n1. To really live it up, be prepared to drop up to $100 per person.  Coming here on a tight budget is as dumb as coming here on a full stomach.\n2. ORDER THE WAGYU RIBEYE and split it with another person (if need be).\n3. Before you leave, ask to see the James Bond table.\n\n\nGrade: I don't always eat steak, but when I do...I prefer Del Frisco's.
