No LOVE for the Beatles at the Mirage in Las Vegas.  Unless you're a hard-core Beatles fan, you will find this mildly entertaining at times and trying to stay awake the rest.  It's low on the acrobatics you'd come to expect from a Cirque du Soleil production.  At first, I'd thought that I accidentally stumbled in to an off-Broadway revival of \"Hair\", with it's way over-done tribute to the 60's and 70's.  \n\nThen there is a VERY weird and pretty dark segment that can only be described as anti-Christian.  With a horned devil-like trapeze artist and a Cross surrounded by fire and screeching hell-like noise.  \n\nThere are a couple of really beautiful adagio numbers that try to off-set the rest of the blah-blah attempts at comedy and repetitious tricks.  But mostly, I was bored!  And not just our group.  There was a prevailing lack of energy in the room and the whole audience could sense it.  \n\nSave your 160.00 and go see something else.
