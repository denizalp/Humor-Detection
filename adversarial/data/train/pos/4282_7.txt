THIS WAS WAY BETTER THAN BRITNEY SPEARS!!! Hands down!! Hour and odd amount of minutes of men dressing themselves to undress themselves. I high fived a few and touched some abs and I was in the back! It's a very \"interactive\" show ;) and if you like the smell of old spice you're in luck!! It's out there!!\n\nNothing seen but some insane abs and some amazing toned a$$es. You get your money's worth. Non stop screaming and laughter and WTF do I do?? Moments!! Saw this the day after Britney omg I'm mad I paid more for her because when I come back to Vegas I'll be seeing these guys again!! It was just great on its own level!! Friends, bachelorette parties, whatever your reason you will not be disappointed with TDU!!
