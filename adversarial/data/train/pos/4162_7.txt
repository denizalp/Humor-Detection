This is a good option downtown especially if you have an event at the convention center. You can walk to everything from here. Overall this is a good choice for the area. \n\nThe decor is nice, but could use some updating. The staff is friendly. The rooms are inline with expectations. I do not like having to pay for internet, especially daily, so that was a mild inconvenience. There are two bar options in the hotel. There is also a cafe that serves Starbucks and some breakfast pastries. There is a restaurant on site as well. I only tried it for breakfast. That was very disappointing but i will save that for my review of it.
