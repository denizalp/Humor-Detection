To where eggs is bae, eh?\n\nI am not a fan of breakfast sandwiches (you can't even get me to eat a Starbucks brekkie), but damn, the products here are quite eggcellent.\n\nEgg Bae oozes with hip millennial attitude--the crackin' names of their items (might be too much bae for me), the Kensington Market location, obligatory neon sign, extensive wall painting by UBER 5000 (same artist for the Toronto Humane Society's mural), ghetto blasted hip hop--so much so that they even feel the need to fry a convenient acronym to justify how much eggs here is bae. Cute concept, I'll give it that, especially when the old guys from the upstairs Chinese club hang out at the front patio space.\n\nThey did warn it could take a while to make the food fresh, and indeed about 20 minutes later that I was munching on a 'Bae-sic' sandwich. Nicely toasted bun enclosing a fried egg, pork belly sausage, muenster cheese and other good stuff... frankly it is not as basic as it looks or sound. This one's all scrambled with great fresh balanced flavours that had me feeling sunny side up and not too full. I enjoyed it very much. It is bae.\n\nFor a fast casual eatery, they could definitely speed up the cooking though.
