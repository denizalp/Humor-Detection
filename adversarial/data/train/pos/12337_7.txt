I wouldn't buy records here if it were the last record shop on earth.  The owner is a rude individual and has zero customer service skills and if you don't spend enough money, he will talk about you behind your back and certainly not in a nice way.\n\nSpent a great deal of money there and I have regretted it.\n\nAlso if you are looking for collectible records this is the last place I would go as Clint doesn't know his ass from his elbow about dirt pressings, second pressings or 109th pressings.\n\nBeware\n\nLearn to take criticism pal.  This just makes you more of a jackass\nand don't size people up by what cars they drive pinhead
