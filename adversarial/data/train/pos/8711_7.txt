Normally I reserve reviews to be written until a place has been around for at least a couple months - There are always bumps that need to be ironed out, staff that needs more training, dishes that need re-working. But honestly, not here! Container Bar is just simply put: Fun, fun, foodie, fun!\n\nSnugly nestled in the alleyway beside the sister wine bar\/resto of Container Bar, the Brasserie, an old shipping container that has magnificently been refurbished into a working cantenna-style bar is the basis for the outdoor attraction. Around the container the rest of the alley is filled with about 6 tables. So this quaint spot really feels small and special. \n\nThe staff is super friendly, fun and quick on their feet. The food is Canadian-comfort like to-die-for poutine! I had a fantastic Fisherman's sandwich - I definitely recommend it. And the cocktail\/wine list is small but nicely assembled. I hear that they will soon be getting casks of beer in weekly for those brew loving boys and girls. \n\nFor originality, outdoor-only dining and out of sight eats; I give Container Bar 5 big stars!
