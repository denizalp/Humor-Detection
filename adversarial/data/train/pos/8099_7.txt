So, in general, I don't like Yelp or find Yelp reviews accurate. And people who are Yelp \"Elite\"... your reviews are obnoxious and you should find something better to do with your time...after you watch South Park. But I figured this Bavette's was worth my first review. My girlfriend and I went here yesterday on opening night. It's our favorite steakhouse in Chicago, hands down and we've celebrated her birthday there two years in a row (in Chicago), now three years in a row with our visit to the Monte Carlo location. Bottom line, if you're a local, don't stay away because it's in the Monte Carlo. The food is just as good as the original in Chicago, and the staff is somehow even friendlier. The menu is exactly the same as Chicago. Must gets: Any of the bone-in steaks, the elote style corn side, the bacon and tomato salad (it's actually huge slabs of pork belly. They also have kept the same corkage fee policy they have in Chicago: waived so long as you share or exchange one glass with a random table. But, don't take my word for it. Listen to Phil Vittel (Chicago food critic) or Chicago Magazine (http:\/\/www.chicagomag.com\/Chicago-Magazine\/November-2017\/Chicagos-Best-Steakhouses-2017\/) I've been to to 7 of their top 10. It's number one on their list, and deserves to be. They even have several managers from Chicago living in the hotel working to make sure it lives up to their standards. Only caveat I can think of: traffic might be a pain during Golden Knights home games, so leave a little earlier.
