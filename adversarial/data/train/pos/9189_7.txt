Well, I wasn't expecting much, and I was pleasantly surprised.\n\nKinda not fair, I know, but I live near some of the best, cheapest Mexican food on the planet, so they're starting at a bit of a disadvantage.\n\nAnd tho I wish I was a tequila drinker, I'm not. Not only do they have a nice selection of tequilas, but apparently everyone who orders a sampler gets a fancy girl sent to their table. And when I say fancy girl, you know what I mean, right? Well, it is Vegas. But not since that time in college (with the falling down and tree climbing) has tequila tasted good to me. And believe me, I've tried (there was the subsequent time with the plastic trash can and stark nudity...not a good thing).\n\nSo, no tequila for me. Sy got the blackberry margarita, which was good, except for the tequila (she claims it was all good), and I got a mango mojito, which was one of the best I've ever had. We were also visiting Sy's folks, so no heavy boozing for me (no guitar shaped drink on the strip--waaah!). It's safe to assume that I was missing out on the drinks.\n\nMiz Sy got a very tasty veggie enchilada number. It was good, with an interesting mix of veggies. (I think it needed a little carnitas or something, but she disagreed.) I decided to try something new (i.e. not the carnitas or flank steak), and got the seafood chile rellenos and the corn soup. Both were very good, except they needed a little carnitas or flank steak. \n\nSo definitely come here, spend some money before you lose it in the casino (did I mention that it's not cheap? it's not. for our non-drinkie relatively smallish meal, we ended up spending more than $60).  And if you like tequila, tell the girls hi for me.
