This place is a special sort of hell.\n\nDid you make a Genius Bar appointment for 10:15am? Maybe someone will come check on you at 10:50am...maybe not. Who knows! What, do you have somewhere else to be? Hahahaha! No. Surely you just wanted to rot away your morning, counting blueshirts milling about. Don't bother wondering why they had so many open slots for 10:15 if there weren't going to be enough staff on hand. When someone eventually decides to acknowledge your now 45-minute late \"appointment\", it will take them all of 5 minutes to tell you they don't have the parts and suggest you visit an authorized service centre.\n\nYou know when I would have loved to know that? 10:15.
