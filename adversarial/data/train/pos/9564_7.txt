Lounge Review:\n\nSometime after my third lap around the tables, this place finally caught my eye.\n\nLooking to satisfy my craving for whiskey, I was really hoping to find some nicely aged Yamazaki but secretly hoped for Hibiki.\n\nI reluctantly had to settle for Black Label neat and decided to wash it down with a side order of tempura.\n\nTempura was crisp, light and delicious.\nThey served an avocado tempura that was a rather half-assed attempt to try something different or a stroke of genius; considering how good it was, I'm thinking it was the later.
