Don't worry if you're a little wary of the Pointe Squaw Peak at first. It looks like the year 1972 had a baby with an Old West tourist trap. But they will thankfully spare you mock shootouts and panning for gold. Crusty exterior aside, there's some pretty cool stuff here, not the least of which is the Hole in the Wall restaurant. Though it's straight out of Frontierland from the front, the cool ranch house interior has better withstood the test of time. Flat screen televisions for your spectator sporting pleasure did not hurt this cause. If outdoor dining is more your thing, the ample palm-ringed back patio overlooking the resort's pool has a festive feel and is extraordinarily comfortable. Our big ol' group was well served by the friendly waitress, and though we just ordered cocktails and a boatload of appetizers, all the fried things in the shape of a stick or a ball were done well. It wouldn't be the last meal of my life or anything, but if you're just looking to relax on a lazy afternoon, it's a hell of a spot to grab grub and some drinks.
