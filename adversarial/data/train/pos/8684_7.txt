Why BodyHeat is better:\n\n*Hand towels and\/or washcloths in the changing rooms\n*Shampoo, conditioner and soap in the showers--not just foaming hand soap\n*Front desk staff is friendlier there\n*Parking is more plentiful\n*No pushy salespeople\n*No tipping teachers and cleaning people (Vegas, amirite?)\n\nWhy VegasHot is better:\n*More classes offered at more times\n*Cheaper than just about anywhere\n*Classes are more humid here, which I like (some don't)\n\n\nI had a LivingSocial for this place and I enjoyed coming here for about the length of the coupon. I'm glad that I tried it out so I have some more experience with different studios, but this studio is bare-bones in order to keep prices low and make the sale. The showers are the equivalent of a freshman dorm---yuck. \n\nAlso, about 70% of the time, the front desk staff is straight up bitchy. The terms of the contracts here are really confusing, and I witnessed the staff getting visibly frustrated at people asking questions on numerous occasions, whether in person or on the phone. It's really not acceptable to roll your eyes at a person who just left in an attempt to bond with me while I'm in line waiting to purchase a water. \n\nCell phones, keys, talking and late arrivals are allowed in the room at this studio. \n\nBodyHeat is closer to my house and I also feel like I get more bang for my buck here.  Yeah, it's more expensive, but I don't feel like I'm going to get gangrene from the showers. I also get a mat and towel for free every time I go to the studio. The savings in laundry loads at home is enough for me to go to BodyHeat vs. this place.
