We came into this cafe while walking along Queen Street. Sud Forno is an Italian Bakery that sells delicious treats for your sweet tooth such as biscotti, cookies, cannolis, bambalones. In addition, they also sell sandwiches and other savoury foods for cafes.\n\nThe upstairs seating area is comprised of a huge table with a large window- definitely a place to check out if you want to host an event fit for roughly 25 people. It's got this rustique, hipster feel towards it. Upstairs, there are cups and water available for guests with no time limit - also a great place for students to come and study.\n\nFood: We got the nutella bambalone which is like a donut with rich nutella squeezed inside. Of course, who doesn't love nutella? They also have the custard option, both for $3.The chocolate cookie was a little dry for my preference and was less than a dollar for a super small cookie. I've never had a cannolli before, but for something roughly the size of a USB, it was a little over $2 and had pistachio nut on one side and was filled with cream.The last one was the sfogliatelle, it was definitely hard to pronounce, but that one was my favourite as the texture was flakey and crunchy and baked perfectly.
