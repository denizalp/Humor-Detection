Once upon a time, this was an awesome property.  Now, it's suffering from old age and a lack of investment.  Here's the breakdown:\n\nPROS\n- Pretty cool pool area.  In my opinion, this is the best part of the hotel.....it's tropical, has real pink flamingos, and is fun.\n\n- Cheap rates.  You can find rooms in the high $30's to $40 range here often.  I send my budget minded friends here.\n\n- Jimmy Buffet's Margaritaville.  This place is a lot of fun.  It overlooks the Strip and has decent eats and fun music.  I'll have to write a separate review one day for it.\n\n- Cheap gambling.  Most of their table games have low minimum bets.\n\n- Location.  It's center Strip and It's on the monorail line.  Easy access up and down the East side of the Strip from the Sahara to the MGM Grand on the monorail.  Reasonable walking distance from Paris to Palazzo (50% of the Strip).\n\nCONS\n- It's old and it shows.  This place peaked in the mid-90's.\n\n- It reeks of smoke.  The last time I was there I walked from the parking garage to Margaritaville and back without stopping in the casino.  However, when I got home my clothes smelled as if I was out all night gambling and smoking cigarettes.  Blech.\n\n- Parking garage has small, tight spaces.  This is one of my least favorite parking garages in the city.  The spaces are small and I'm always afraid that my car is going to get scratched or dented.....because it has happened in the past. \n\n- They have timeshare sales people that will bother you when you walk by their booth.  I'm not a fan of this at all.  Who wants to be bothered like that on vacation or on a night out?  It's no different than those escort card smackers on the Strip.\n\nOverall, you have to understand what you're getting here and it's cheap.  So if you're on a budget, this hotel is for you.....but don't have high expectations otherwise you'll be disappointed.\n\nWill I return?  Sure.
