It is a pretty standard Americanized Chinese restaurant. It is close to our home, so it is in the rotation of our go to places when we are feeling lazy or just don't feel like cooking. We only dined in once and the service was fine. The prices are pretty reasonable for the amount of food that you get. The menu is hit or miss, so if you find something that you like it is best to stick with it. I personally enjoy Happy Family (shrimp, chicken and beef), Szechwan Chicken and Chicken with Broccoli. These items come with steamed rice and are $5.75 for small and $8.95 for a large. I think a large entree is easily shareable if you get an appetizer or a soup to split as well. They do have a lunch special that ranges from $4.95 to $6.25 and includes an egg roll, rice, and a soup or hot tea if you're dining in. It is a good deal, but don't expect a ton of meat in your entree during the lunch special.
