Not happy with the service.  The pellegrino was served on heavy glasses i asked for fine glasses.  Also the server saw me pouring my own pellegrino water.  When I completed my meal the waiter had the nerve to challenge my 10% tip.  He made me feel real uncomfortable and i will never come back to this place again or recommend.  Just not cool what the waiter did to me.  I should have hone back to speak to the manager.
