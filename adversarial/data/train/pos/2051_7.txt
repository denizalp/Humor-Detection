We returned yet again for dinner and a show with Chef Eric and the Yummy Grill Ohana, and as always, another memorable night was enjoyed by all..\nWarmly greeted by hostesses Jennifer, Jackie, and Jessica, we are seated up at the bar and greeted by all the chefs who are dressed in red, adding a nice touch for the holidays. We are like kids in a candy store at this point and ready to get our omakase on...\n\nWe start out with some Sunomono and Garlic-Chili Edamame, and we also receieve some tasty house soju and also, a bottle of Gekkeikan Horin Ultra Premium Junmai Daiginjo Sake. I'm no sake expert, and I usually don't have sake, but this was some smooth stuff! Our dinner consisted of the following courses:\n\nOKAYU WITH ABALONE, TUNA, AND NATTO\nWifey never had natto just for the smell alone(fermented soybeans) and I was slightly nervous at first sight, but after her first spoonful, she couldn't stop raving about it! The warmth of the okayu, the smokiness of the abalone, and the nuttiness of the natto with nice chunks of tuna kissed with shoyu and sesame oil all worked well and was an excellent preview of what was in store\n\nTORO WITH CUCUMBER AND PONZU\nNice meaty texture from the Spanish Toro and crisp cucumber and ponzu complimented it very nicely.\n\nLIVE BOSTON SCALLOP SASHIMI\nSweet and succulent, the sashimi was topped with a yuzu-ponzu sauce, dried miso, Italian caviar, and Japanese gold leaf. We also had for the first time the scallop fin, which Chef Eric expertly prepared by cleaning and gently cooking which had a nice tender texture similar to abalone.\n\nALASKAN KING CRAB WRAPPED IN CUCUMBER\nTopped with red and black tobiko this was also very sweet and refreshing.\n\nLIVE SANTA BARBARA UNI WITH CHIARASHI RICE\nAlways a must when available, this time we weren't sharing, so we each got our own! Its THAT good....\n\nO-TORO TARTARE\nChef Eric took a nice fatty slab of O-Toro, made an exquisite tartare and topped it off with a generous portion of Italian caviar and Japanese gold leaf. My opu was crying tears of joy with every spoonful!\n\nDUO OF HAMA HAMA AND MIYAGI OYSTERS\nBoth oysters were delicious with the ponzu and wasabi tobiko. The Hama Hama Oysters had a nice kick with the addition of kimchi.\n\nThe passion and precision Chef Eric displays throughout this experience is totally unmatched IMHO...He goes into every detail as far as the source, the preparation\nof each component, and you are also educated along the way, and I have never seen a more personable Sushi Chef that engages with his guests which is a great reason he has a great following of devoted customers.\n\n\nThe Duke of YSG, Kevin P. joined us for a bit, and I offered him some sake but unfortunately he was on the job, so that left me and Chef Eric to finish the bottle because Wifey was slightly buzzin' too. Don't know how many times we kanpai'd throughout the evening but we killed that bottle. People on the other end of the bar were having a sake bomb marathon, and we've never had a sake bomb, nor had we witnessed such a ritual, so the whole bar ends up having sake bombs! Chef Eric nicely orchestrated a total of 9 in a row and it was a cool spectacle to see! Our nigiri fest consisted of the following:\n\nHALIBUT NIGIRI\nFrom Jeju Island, South Korea. Very generous cut of halibut dabbed with a bit of Yuzu Koshi...Nice clean flavor.\n\nAJI NIGIRI\nPremium snapper from Tsukiji, Japan brushed with premium shoyu...absolutely delicious.\n\nSHIMA-AJI NIGIRI\nAlso from Tsukiji, brushed with premium shoyu topped with fresh wasabi...very delicate and tasty.\n\nKAZUNOKO\nHerring Roe in pressed form with what tasted like Saba(Mackerel). Rich, oily, and the crunch of the herring roe gave this a nice textural contrast\n\nJI-KINMEDAI NIGIRI\nThis had a soft texture very similar to Kampachi and we enjoyed this one as well\n\nHAMACHI NIGIRI\nWho doesn't love Hamachi? Simple, straightforward, and awesome.\n\nTRIO OF TORO NIGIRI\nWhat an awesome way to end our sushitarian feast with the prized Bluefin Tuna from Spain! a progression for toro starting with the Akami or loin, followed by Chu-Toro, the center of the belly, and finally O-Toro, the fattylicious underbelly finessed by fresh wasabi, Italian caviar, and Japanese gold leaf...Absolutely mindblowing!\n\nWe ended on a sweet note with a PLUM ICE CREAM TEMPURA, and once again thanked the Yummy Grill ohana for yet again another stellar evening....ALOHA!!!
