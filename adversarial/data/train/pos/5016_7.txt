The Forum Shops are celebrating their 25th anniversary!  I can't believe they're 25 years old already and I know this only because we were here the other night and there were signs all over the place to tell us this fact.  It just shows you how time really does fly.  I remember when we used to come here all the time when my son was a wee lad because he loved the free shows about Zeus, Poseidon, Atlantis, etc. located near The Cheesecake Factory and the Nike store.  They used to rotate the story lines back then and I don't know if they still do, but we did watch \"Fall of Atlantis\" during our recent visit and it still draws a crowd.  \nThis is always a good place to window shop, walk off dinner, get out of the heat, and people watch.  There are some good eats here, too, including Joe's Prime and Border Grill.  Tourists and locals alike keep The Forum Shops alive and they're definitely a part of the Vegas experience.  Happy 25th!
