Either you LOVE F&E or you don't....\n\nF&E is like the love child if Trader Joe's and Circle K had offspring.\n\nF&E is for the shopper\/customer who wants to run in and run out...someone who likes convenience. It's not a full-blown grocery store. I rarely shop at chain grocery stores. I spend LESS here and get MORE for my money.\n\nI like the NO-HASSLE parking, self check-out, low prices, weekly coupon offering, & friendly staff. I shop here like a Super Market Sweep contestant...grab and go in just minutes.\n\nBags of salad stay fresh even days beyond the expiration date...the stuff at the chain grocers seem to turn brown and slimy days (sometimes a week) BEFORE the expiration. The produce at F&E has always been fantastic!\n\nThis location (on the corner of 107th Ave\/Thomas) has windows, so it is more bright inside than the location on Dysart. \n\nOverall: i {heart} Fresh & Easy!!!
