Im hungry. Lets see what pops up on my bookmarks. Well, would you look at that. Pop Up Pizza just happens to be about 3 blocks away.\n\nFirst off, the place is located inside The Plaza Hotel and Casino. You can park in the Plaza parking lot for 5 bucks cash only (free for those that are gold or platinum or whatever card you need that the sign says at the gate). Dont worry though, keep your parking receipt, have the attendant at PUP stamp your parking receipt after you pay for your food, and then take that stamped receipt to the cashier at the cashier cage about 50 yards away so they can give you your 5 bucks back.\n\nAs you go up to the counter, you can see garlic knots and all the pizza that is available for purchase by the slice. If you refer to my pic, they have this combo menu right on counter. You have 6 options. I picked combo number 1 which is any two slices and a large soda for 7.99. I selected a slice of the Harris Meatball Pie and the Fremont.\n\nThe Harris Meatball Pie: Mozzarella, classic Italian meatballs, caramelized onions, olives and topped with fresh basil. Nuff said.\nThe Fremont: Mozzarella, Italian sausage, bacon, pepperoni, roasted peppers, and roasted eggplant. Again, nuff said.\n\nThe only negatives I observed is that when you park in the Plaza parking lot, you gotta walk past the Greyhound bus station. That place in itself is a whole other review. http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz\/greyhound-bus-lines-las-vegas#query:greyhound%20bus%20station\nAlso, where the seating area is for PUP is basically in the wide open portion of the casino itself, meaning that whatever secondhand smoke is lingering around will give your pizza the smoke flavoring that you dont want.\n\nSome random info: I was told there was free wifi but I couldnt get it to work for me. The domain is popup pizza. The password is popuppizza1. They are open daily from 11 am to 2 am for you guys that have the munchies late at night.\n\nIn closing, I think their thin crust pizza is pretty good. Its just the 5 dollar parking that you eventually get back, the scenic route to PUP, and the unwanted added secondhand smoke flavoring to my pizza that kind of ruins the moment.\n\nYelp 2014 365 Review Challenge #94
