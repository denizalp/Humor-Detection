I really have no complaints about Southwest as I've started flying them more often now that I live in San Diego. They're one of two airlines that flies direct to Vegas, so I can't fly AA without wasting hours of time. I'm not crazy about the boarding process with Southwest, but I have a script that gets me an A boarding group every time. Free checked bags is nice when I need it. I just wish they flew out of the D Gates so I could use the Centurion lounge before my flight. As it stands, I go early for the lounge and then take the skytrain back from D and out to C for my flight.
