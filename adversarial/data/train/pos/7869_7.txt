Legit Chinese food in the west valley. \n\nMost definitely above average, as they bring a unique style to some of their dishes. They understand you can make good Chinese without deep frying everything in tons of batter and putting tons of sugar in. My sesame chicken and fried rice were surprisingly light and savory. More importantly, I didn't feel like passing out for like 12 hours after finishing it. The honey walnut shrimp (the proper name of which escapes me) was freaking delicious.\n\nOf course, they seem to have less common items as well. Their special when I was there was a flounder in black bean sauce dish. Not something I've seen before, so I may have to give it a try! The menu really is pretty expansive with lots of the classics, as well as affordable lunch specials.\n\nOther nifty aspects of Wong's are the really cool interior. It looks so fancy you'll feel the need to tuck in your shirt! Lots of room, and it's great for big groups. They're Yelp friendly as well, and serve up a groovy check-in deal. This is good stuff, and I'm happy to see something like it in the Avondale area.
