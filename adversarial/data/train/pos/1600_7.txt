This was our first stop after dropping our things off at the hostel.\n\nI wants me some 11pm fries + cheese curds + gravy!\n\nThe Frite Alors ($8.50) is topped with mushrooms, bacon, and onions. The Tunisienne ($9) was better, smothered in crumbled spicy merguez. Ohhhh poutine. After a long, foodless train ride, this Montreal favorite did the trick for filling our bellies with greasy, comforting goodness - though I really, really wished the toppings were hotter. \n\nA \"small\" size is heavy enough to be a meal for one person. I finished an order all by myself, and consequently felt like I hated everything and wanted to lie down. \n\nThe food was 3 stars - try the Tunisienne. I'm giving 4 stars because our waiter was insanely friendly and helpful. He gave us food and beer suggestions and we got to try some local Quebec brews immediately! Blanche de Chambly is good if you like light, citrusy Belgians. Dieu du Ciel's coffee stout was... very, very dark. $5.50 for a bottle of 9.5% ABV beer? Okay!
