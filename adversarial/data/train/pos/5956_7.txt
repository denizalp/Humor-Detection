A few months ago I went to Sona MedSpa to find out more about their services and boy did I learn a lot!\n\nSona has a procedure called coolsculpting that targets the fat cells in a specific area of the face, neck or body and cryogenically freezes them and causing them to die off! \n\nAfter studying the procedure, it seemed to be perfect for someone like me who has stubborn areas on my body that no matter how much I diet and exercise I do the small pockets of fat won't seem to go away! \n\nI wasn't interested in a costly surgical procedure, just something simple to help me along in my better body goal!  \n\nAfter doing my research on coolsculpting I found that there was no downtime, it's cost-effective, and only targets the areas that you need a little help with!  \n\nThree months later and I'm here at Sona for my coolsculpting treatment!  The office is very well maintained and clean. \n\nThe waiting areas are fully stocked with a variety of hot teas and ice cold water!  \n\nI was taken to the coolsculpting room within a few minutes!  Liz was the technician that did my treatment; she snapped a few photos and I was ready to begin! \n\nShe did two areas back to back and they were 60 minutes each. Liz explained every detail of what was going to happen and made sure I was comfortable.  \n\nOnce I had my phone and tablet by my side I was ready to go! She put a cool pad on and applied the machine, it was a little uncomfortable for about eight minutes then I was fine. The time flew by, and 60 minutes later I was done!  The second hour was even quicker than the first, but I was able to take care of some business and even book a flight while getting my coolsculpting treatment! \n\nAfter the treatment Liz massaged the areas, and shortly after I was on my way!  \n\nLiz explained that I will start to see results in a few days but the real difference will be revealed in about three to four months!  \n\nStay tuned for an update yelpers!
