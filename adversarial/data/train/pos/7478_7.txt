\"Crystal Palace Skating Center...The Skate of the Art!\" Any Las Vegas local will remember this radio jingle from way back. It's my dad's claim to fame, and when he wrote it, I was right around the age where roller skating was THE THING to do...I'm a bit past that age now, but my memories still make me laugh at how much this meant to all of my school friends. Every weekend we would go skating, eat pizaa candy hot dogs sodas and anything else we could get our hands on, and go home with upset stomachs and sore feet. Well, I recently revisited my old stomping grounds and not much has changed. The eighties dcor is still there, the junk food abundant, and kiddie roller skaters (excuse me, bladders) are still falling everywhere. Ahh...the memories. I suggest you check out this Vegas legend before (God forbid) the owners call it a day. \n\nRecommended snack: Pizza, or else you just won't fit in with this crowd\n\nRecommended company: Preferably some tots, so when you fall because you haven't skated in ten years, you can blame it on them pulling on your pant leg. And so you don't feel awkward for the couple's skate.
