I was over to Matt's again last week. I finally had a chance to try lunch here. OMG! This place should be called Matt's bad ass Butter Burger! Are you kidding me it is so amazingly delicious! I have been lucky I guess and have not had to wait to get into Matt's. But I would wait for one of these burgers any day! Katie food was OK are you nuts! First Watch can't even be compared to Matt's menu. UGH gimme a break!\n\nMatt's ButterBurger is so freakin good I don't have words to describe the deliciousness of it all.
