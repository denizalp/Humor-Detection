There's nothing amazing about this guy, except how amazingly terrible his act is. The venue was tiny! The front row consisted of four people. For the price I paid I should've have asked for my money back. He also did a \"trick\" in which he rips somebody's 20 dollar bill in half, which happened to be my friend since he chose him to come up on stage. He said he would fix it, but when we looked for him after the show, he was gone! We were out 20 bucks! What a douche! Don't see this guy, he obviously does not give a sh*t about his show.
