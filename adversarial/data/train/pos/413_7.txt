Ever since a local cafe in good ol' Orange County got rid of my beloved chocolate croissants where the chocolate was uniquely baked into the dough instead of just stuffed inside a plain croissant, I've been on a quest to find a comparable chocolate croissant. I was staying at the Cosmo and walked by this little coffee storefront on the way to my room...and lo and behold, I spotted such croissants! I immediately ran in to buy one, and even though it cost a ridiculous amount, it was well worth every penny! The croissant was very flaky, and each layer had just the right amount of chocolate.\n\nI also ordered a latte, but it cost almost $8 because I got a larger size and asked for soy milk. The latte was just okay and definitely wasn't worth the money. I would only come here for the chocolate croissants, but not for anything else, considering the pricing is so steep. I would much rather go to another coffee shop for everything, but the croissants! ;) 2.5 stars, rounded down for being a rip-off!
