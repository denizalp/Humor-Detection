Objectively speaking, you cannot get around the fact that Sapphire is the largest strip club in Las Vegas, as well as in the state and quite possibly the whole planet. With so many exotic dancing bodies packed into one single space, you are bound to have a variety of selections, some of which is better than what you may find elsewhere. And thus without a doubt, applying the law of statistics in particular the Gaussian distribution, if you are looking for the best looking dancers to spend quality time with this is the place to visit. Around 68% of the girls will be average looking, however once you look hard enough into the +1sigma and even the +2sigma, you will most likely find more attractive girls here. \n\nWith this in mind, here is the tradeoff: this club has large open spaces filled with comfy chairs and hence you won't get private lap dances unless you spend $$$ for the VIP time with the girls. It is very smokey inside the club so if you spend a lot of time here, be prepare to cut a few years off your life via second-hand smoke. I was inside for roughly 10 minutes and the absorption of smoke permeated all throughout my clothes, hair and skin. Eeek.\n\nSapphire also has a pool that opens during the day in the summer, or so I've heard though I've never been to it. I don't think the girls lounging at the pool go topless either.\n\nLadies and gentlemen, always remember to tip well. Dancers are workers who live off tips you know?!
