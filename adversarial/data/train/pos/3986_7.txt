The \"new show\" with giant toy box set design and new music was a disappointment. In previous years the music has gotten one in the Christmas spirit. Not so this year. Music was a disappointment, storyline was not interesting. They do not showcase the talent in the new show. The women appear to be objects to view. In past years their talented voices were shared.Will not attend in the future. Save your money.
