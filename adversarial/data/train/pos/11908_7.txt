Wonderful experience all around & I look forward to staying again.\n\nAria is an elegant space with a modern, fun decor. Compared to other hotels on the Strip, Aria has a mimilasitc design that feels classy and calming. There's a very cool tree motif that I noticed throughout the resort; whether it's a carpet pattern or wall tile designs, the curving beauty of raw wood inspirations are stylish and interesting.\n\nExcellent service from every aspect of Aria staff made our stay a truly 5-star experience. Kanema at check-in was so friendly and accommodating, and she went out of her way to match us with a lovely room. She along with Heather made sure that my parents, who were arriving days later, would receive a room on the same floor too. Check-out was similarly seamless, probably beacuse I got matched with Kanema again - thanks, Kanema! Aria's manager Comron was also very accomodating and definitely helped make our stay flawless. We used the North Valet multiple times a day, and each attendent moved fast and was quick to help with bags or directions. In similar fashion, housekeeping was excellent, and our room felt as fresh as if we just checked in each day of our stay.\n\nThe on-site gym was wonderful - plenty of machines & free weights, along with complimentary towels, water, and apples. The pools and hot tubs are clean and well-kept, and service is very prompt without hovering too much.\n\nI loved the selection of restaurants inside Aria! Japanese, Spanish, Chinese, French, Thai... the variety's awesome. We'll need to visit again soon to continue sampling all of the delicious flavors.
