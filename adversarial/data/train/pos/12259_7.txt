Ayyyyy dios mio! I have never been so happy to eat Mexican food. Forget Filibertos and every other 'bertos place... Mariscos is the new spot for hangover food, feel-good food, comfort food or stuff-your-face food. \n\nI had no idea what to order - luckily one of my girlfriends is Mexican, so she brought us some phenomenal dishes. One of them was a bowl of soup with every type of seafood (shrimp, mussels, lobster, clams, etc.) imaginable (mouth-watering). One of them was a mixed plate of chicken\/beef\/shrimp fajitas with crazy toppings (so freaking tasty). One of them was a chili pepper guacamole shrimp insane mix of a platter (delicious). Then, we had these drinks called Micheladas (spell-check that shit) which consisted of tomato juice and some weird beer. Instant hang-over cure, by the way.\n\nThey also have a stage with a live band that plays music while you eat! I haven't seen that since my Rocky Point days! \n\nThe service is a tadddd bit slow (we waited for quite awhile to get sour cream) but the waitresses are super sweet, and the food is heavenly, so I really didn't care. \n\nYou HAVE to check this place out.
