Fine steaks and Martinis. Definately a keeper inside Green Valley Ranch. I love the food and its all good. Try the seafood como appetizer and you get it all. Pricey but good. Lump crabmeat cocktail, filet, potato and whiskey and the party is on! But they seem to get lounge lizard musicians that dont help the great vibe in the room.
