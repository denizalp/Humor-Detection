Funky little independent eastern-european-owned bakery, pastry, and cake shop that also does a handful of sandwiches.\n\nDoesn't sound like much, but tastiness and quality aren't necessarily noisy. 8^ )\n\nI'd often passed this place on my way somewhere else, seeing their European Bakery sign and thinking they MIGHT have a deli, but they aren't advertising it, so why take the chance.  Daren C and I finally stopped in, and we were glad we did.\n\nThe breads are all made fresh daily with what the owner is proud to tell you are his own versions of classic european recipes, and the meats are all imported.  The owner is quite happy to talk about how he sends back a slab of pastrami several times if it doesn't look right ot him.\nIf the man tells you that he put together all of the sandwich recipes because those are the ingredients that taste best together, you would be wise to heed that man!\n\nFor 6.50-7.25, you get a HUGE sandwich on a fresh-baked sub-baguette.  Daren's Italian had everythign you could think of, and was a veritable UN of sandwiches, it had meat and cheese imported from so many different places.  My roast beef with roasted red peppers and swiss was absolutely delicious -- like a rare steak, a small salad, and bread all wrapped up in my hand for lunch, instead of spread out on a dinner plate.\n\nThe baked goods are where the husband and wife team claim to really shine, and it sure did look and smell wonderful. There are an assortment of pastries and baklava and other tasty treats to select from, both familiar and unfamiliar looking.  TheFrench bread the sandwich was made on was tasty and soft inside\/ crisp outside.\nTheir other loafs looked and smelled delicious.  And for only 2.99 for a full sized loaf i know i'll come back and try more bread flavors soon.
