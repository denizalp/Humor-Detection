I got an amazing deal to stay at any MGM property which also included two complimentary show tickets (we saw Zumanity, http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz\/cirque-du-soleil-zumanity-las-vegas-2#hrid:19S9n3DPsmmkib35do5BeA), so I couldn't pass up this chance to stay at Mandalay Bay.\n\nLOCATION - Mandalay Bay is located on the south side of the Strip so it was pretty far from all the excitement. This made taxis to other parts of the Strip a little expensive but a plus is that it's close to the airport. It's next door to Luxor and Excalibur and there is also a tram to get you to and from those hotels.\n\nROOMS - We stayed in one of the deluxe rooms and it was really nice! We had a great view of the pools. The room itself is really spacious and it was pretty awesome having a tv in the bathroom. I liked that the toilet was separate from the shower\/tub. The beds were so comfortable!\n\nDINING\/ENTERTAINMENT\/CASINO - There are many dining options throughout the hotel and casino but we mostly ate at more affordable spots in the Shoppes at Mandalay Place. The casino was huge but surprisingly easy to navigate and the ventilation was pretty good. Loved the floral scents! They also just opened a club called LIGHT that features Cirque Du Soleil performers and there's also the Shark Reef aquarium.\n\nPOOL - We actually didn't spend too much time at the pools but they are gorgeous! The main pool, lazy river, and wave pool cater more towards families but there is also Moorea Beach Club, which is 21+, for adults. I love that they brought in sand so you really feel like you're at the beach!\n\nSERVICE - The weekend we decided to go was pretty busy for Mandalay Bay because of One Direction, but check-in didn't take as long as I thought it would. At check-in, I had some issues with payment (always tell your bank you will be travelling!) but eventually got it sorted out. I want to personally say thank you to Lia for being so understanding and patient with me! Everyone we talked to was really helpful and kind, which made staying at Mandalay Bay such a joy. I decided to do the express check-out which was a breeze and they email you the itemized receipt. My only issue is the resort fee (but every hotel in Vegas has it now)!\n\nOverall, we absolutely loved staying at Mandalay Bay! I hope I can stay here again for future Vegas trips, but since it's on the pricier side, I'd only stay here again if I had another amazing deal. \n\nIf you don't mind being away from all the excitement, I wouldn't hesitate to stay here. It's a beautiful hotel!
