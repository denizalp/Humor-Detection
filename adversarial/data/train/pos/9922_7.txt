As a lifelong resident of Pittsburgh's second largest neighborhood, I can attest to having been in the thick of what I call The Brookline Pizza Wars for many years. Krazy Brothers is the newest entrant, sitting at a spot where Brookline Blvd. becomes West Liberty Ave. (right across the road from McDonald's) and occupying a small storefront that used to be another pizza place years ago. It was empty for a long time, and I'm glad Krazy Brothers have opened up shop there.\n\nWe got some food delivered this evening, and I have to say that they make a more than decent pie. The crust was puffy, chewy, and crisp. The mushrooms we got on the pizza were chunky and tangy. They don't overdo it with the sauce but are generous with the cheese. \n\nWere there sesame seeds on the bottom?  I assume it's come kind of \"ball bearing\" so that the pizza slides off and on the paddle. Anyway, I liked that they were there. \n\nThe wings were reminiscent of Papa John's in that they were tender and oily good. The Italian hoagie doesn't skimp on the meat and fixins. While it wasn't the very best Italian hoagie I've ever had, it was a fine sandwich in its own right. \n\nKrazy Brothers holds its own, and I hope they stick around for a while.\n\nI mean you can't have too many people makin' pizza in Brookline or anywhere else for that matter.
