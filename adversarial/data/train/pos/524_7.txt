Ahhhhhhhhh... I love the smell of Gun smoke in the afternoon!!!   I am still on a primitive HIGH from the sound, smell and feel of the shotgun in my hands!!  Went here today with my two favorite men and we had a blast blowing away clay pigeons practicing our Trap Shooting skills.  At $4 each a round of 25 on Thursdays it was a FANTASTIC BARGAIN & SO MUCH FLIPPIN' FUN!!  \n\nThe range itself is HUGE and really well designed with individual booths for each shooting party.  Each booth has 5 stations and each round is 25 shots so that's 5 shots at each station.  There is a speaker at each station and the clay pigeons are released by voice activation.  Plus it doesn't hurt that the view is gorgeous!!  This was, by far, the best experience I have had at a shooting range.\n\nThis is an AMAZING range with a superb staff!  Everyone is friendly, helpful, knowledgeable and professional.  I know this will be a regular outing for me and my fam.
