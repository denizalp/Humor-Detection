See, I would probably go to Edison's if I lived or hung out near it, in spite of the kinda sorta bad experience we had during Taste of Tremont. \n\nMy weather-savvy (and quite handsome) man friend looked up and noted that a storm was inches away. We should find a bar to hunker down in, said he. Friggin a! Said I. Edison's ahoy, with two spots open at the bar. Not three minutes later: deluge. \n\nWe ordered two Solo cup pints of Victory Summer Love and opened a tab, just in case. Our fantastic and hilarious bartender took his card and proclaimed the first round would be... wait for it... TWELVE DOLLARS. Where am I, Chicago?\n\nHmm, I take that back. Even in my beloved hometown, do we not often charge six bucks for a Summer Love. Four beers and twenty four dollars later, we waited for a break in the weather and hit the bricks. I'm sure it's a great little local joint and I'm also pretty sure those prices were inflated for the street fair crowd but you know what, that was a dick move if you want people to have a good impression and return.
