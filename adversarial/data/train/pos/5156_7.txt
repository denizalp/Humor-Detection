I really like Pot Liquour. It's BBQ but fancy, why not? I like feeling classy when my face and fingers are covered in BBQ sauce.\nI've been here twice and both times food was on-point. The baby back ribs and mac n cheese are so far my favorite here.\nThe last time I visited with hubby and we got the Go Hog Wild combination plate with some apps. It's  a LOT of food. I had lunch from it for two days after. The combination plate comes with Spare Ribs (the Mr's fave), Pulled Pork, Hot Links (the spice kick comes after), and Mopped Baby Back Ribs. We almost ordered the combination plate that has double the food, thankfully we did not, between the both of us being pretty hungry, we ate less than half. Now we did have appetizers, bacon wrapped meatballs and wings but I expected to make a bigger dent on the combo plate.\nPot Liqour has a full bar, if you like to enjoy an adult beverage during your meal. The times I was here, it was pretty empty. Surprising considering the quality of food and nice decor. Perhaps drink specials can lure in more costumers?
