Every time I spend time in Las Vegas, I feel like the luckiest girl in the world.  Not only do I get to explore really cool hotels, Yelp event venues, and foot massages, but Misti and Bobby Y have introduced me to some really unique restaurants too.\n\nDuring my last visit, I was introduced to Tea Station, and I felt like a little girl in a candy store as I took in all of the tea and snack options on the menu.  Iced Teas, Milk Teas, Iced Coffees, Jelly Ice, Snow Ice, Shaved Ice, Hot Teas, Traditional Teas, Tea flavored Noodles, Snacks, and Meals... I hadn't heard of half of these things before... you see, we have extremely limited boba options in Phoenix, let alone all of those other fun things!\n\nI ended up ordering a green tea with milk and boba and it really hit the spot... so I'll end this review with a request to Tea Station: can you please open your next location in Phoenix?
