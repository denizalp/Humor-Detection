We stayed at Red Rock Casino Resort & Spa because of the package deal from Travelocity B. found.  It's about 30 minutes from the strip, so if you have a car it's an ok place to stay.  Free parking.\n\nThey charge a $27.99 Resort Fee.  Bogus, nobody swims in the Winter because it's outside and cold and all we got for it was a FREE newspaper every morning.  Stupid.\n\nThey have a Bowling Alley - extra charge.  Spa - extra charge.  Regal movie theater- extra charge.\n\nThere's 2 Starbucks, TBone a fancy looking meat place open for dinner, not sure about lunch.  Grand Cafe - meh food - we had breakfast there one time - Extra charge  $7.95 for a nasty bowl of oatmeal w\/ sides like brown sugar, cherries, walnuts.  B. got a SW Special he couldn't finish.  Charged it to the Room.  They wouldn't give us a free dessert - said it was for Dinner only. Bogus.\nFood court - we walked through, nothing good.\n\nB. did drink lots at the bar below the lobby.  He got 1 FREE drink, but he bought maybe 3-4 the whole time.\n\nRoom: huge King size bed, TV, Tub w\/ TV, and separate shower.  Separate door for toilet.  2 sinks.  Hair dryer.  Didn't have coffee pot which I really needed!  If something is missing at the snack bar let them know ASAP otherwise they will charge you for it!  Mini bar if something is missing after a few seconds - Charged.\n\nAn ok place to stay.
