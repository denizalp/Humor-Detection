Peeps who read my stuff know how I feel about subs, grinders, hoagies, whatever.  They lame.  I would rather eat the stuff in the sandwich and pitch the bread.  Some people love bread like like a hoodrat loves his baby mama at tax return time.  I can care less.  They bread here is too much.  I guess they giving you more value for your money but give me more bacon or something, dude.  They kids here always nice and fast and they take coupons.  No complaints about that.  Also, its in Mentor, which is a pasteurized strip-mall from one end of the city to the next but some people find comfort in that...
