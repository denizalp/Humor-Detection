This place is nothing like the hotel liquidators of the past. First off, it doesn't smell like wet dog and corn chips in there and it's air conditioned. The furniture is set up nicely in group displays and most of the furniture is modern and in great condition. They now have an extended showroom in the back. Best of all, most of the prices on their items are very reasonable and if anything very low. They even sell new bed sheets still in the package. I browsed the entire store twice, picked out my items, paid and set up delivery within 45 minutes. It was a very good  experience. The sales gal said they would be liquidating World Market in May so I'm dying to return to check out the treasures they will have.
