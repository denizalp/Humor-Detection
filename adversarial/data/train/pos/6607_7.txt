Sweet baby Jesus.  After waiting half an hour for our drinks, with no one else there, my only outlet for sanity is to write this review.  When asked why she took approximately 8 minutes per drink-- including an iced coffee and a brewed coffee--the barista replied that she prided herself on meticulously measuring eeeeeevvvverrrything.  Which she did, about 4 or 5 times, to make sure it was perfect.  Sadly this technique did not result in noticeably better coffee, but it did make me want to stab my eyes with a fork.
