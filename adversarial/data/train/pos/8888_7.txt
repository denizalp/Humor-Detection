When I hear Icehouse, what initially comes to mind is that 12 ounce tall can costing a dollar and some change. Cheap, tempting, and while I've had it oh once or twice in my life, I don't know if I'll ever pick up another can. Yep, that's kinda what Icehouse is. It has so much potential, but lacks proper execution.\n\nThe bottled beer list is quite impressive, but the food isn't anything special and the draft beer selection is even less impressive. \n\nFor food we had the sports bar staples; wings, which were um, for lack of a better word, gross and chicken strips. Strips with the batter falling off like it was rolling down a slip 'n slide. Other food items I can't comment on, but a friend stated the veggie burger wasn't very good either (he should have read Faith's review before ordering!). \n\nOn a positive note though, the decor is pretty nice. A modern take on the typical sports bar. The kitchen is open and at a glance, Icehouse can almost, almost qualify as a high end restaurant. If only the food were better.
