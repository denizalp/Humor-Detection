I had the Eggs Benedict and with the hash browns and a side of sausages. The Eggs Benedict was tasty but the hash browns more resembled au gratin potatoes then hash browns. I thought the potatoes were unappetizing. The sausages were good and reminded me of some other wild (must be a local to figure this one out) breakfast place in the area that served the same product. The cost of my meal was in the $14 range since I ordered the side. The cost of the meal didn't even include a drink as I had water. So I thought the price of the meal was a lofty and not worth a return visit. I had decent service.
