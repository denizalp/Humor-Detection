I don't care if you're in a hurry or you're tempted by the cheesy decor. You can do better for late-night bites. Ignore the coupon girls. $5 per dish for late night doesn't require a coupon; it's the normal price.\n\nIt claims to be a bar, so it blasts Top 40 music videos (especially remixes), but at least before midnight you'll just see people sitting around, wondering why they can't find a waitress to take their order.\n\nIf you insist on eating here, skip the chili dog and just split the nachos and quesadillas.
