One day I would like very much to have a Belgian chocolatier living in my home. Her name would be Adelheid and she would be plump and lovely and always ALWAYS make my house smell like chocolate and feed me chocolate on beautiful plates or melted in precious pottery or spoons and I would be HAPPY-- WE would be happy, Adelheid and I (oh, and the chocolate).\n\nThis is all to say...I don't know how the Belgians do it. There chocolate is by far the best....and Leonidas is one of the best places to test that theory in Toronto. It's pricey stuff, but you won't regret it.
