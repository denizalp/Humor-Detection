We have used PetSmart before for our Chihuahuas.  This time we just adopted our dog Bella and we she never got groomed before.  She was just tied to a box outside for 6 years before she got rescued.  She really needed groomed and we couldn't wait to get her here.  Of course you have to have your paperwork for rabies documentation before they can groom her.   We finally got that and brought her in for an appointment.  \n\n     We walked in and went over what they were going to do with her.  I got a package for her to get buzzed, bathed, teeth brushed, and nails clipped.  I told them that this was the first time she was ever groomed so they took that into consideration.  They told me it would probably take about 3 hours.  About a hour in a half later they called to let me know that they did what they could.  Since this was her first time she didn't feel comfortable.  She would do a alligator roll to try to get off of the table and being strapped.  They still were able to bath her, clip her nails, teethe, and shave about half of her.  They couldn't get close to her head they said.\n\n     They told me I could bring her back during the weekdays when it is slower so that they could try it again.  That was nice and they didn't charge me yet too.  So we brought her back Tuesday and they shaved the rest of her but they said Bella still wouldn't let them get close to her head.  They gave us some tips to work with her to get her used to clippers around her head.  They said she was really a sweetheart and I could tell that they cared.  \n\n     So her first grooming didn't go great but I feel like the service was really good and we will be back to try it again in a few months.
