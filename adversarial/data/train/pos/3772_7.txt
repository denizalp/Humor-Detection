Second large group experience here.\n\nOut with a party of 10 at 8pm Saturday night looking for dinner and drinks.  After being told it would be a long wait at R&R, we walked to Saddle Ranch.  They said 30 minutes to get us a table for 10... but volunteered that since we had a wait, they would set us up at the bar and the first round is on the house. (!!!)\n\nThe wait was probably a little longer than 30 minutes, but the bartender made great drinks, food and prices were good, and our server brought us a round of after-dinner shots, again, on the house.  \n\nI was especially pleased because this is the second time I've come with a large group on the weekend and we were treated really well at Saddle Ranch - that is why I direct all my large groups here.  Cheers to the manager for taking care of us and earning our loyalty.\n\n\nEDIT: \nIf you're out on a weekend night looking for a good value for a drink, the AMF is the house specialty.  $13 for a carafe (guessing 32 ounces) of a coconut-flavored long island.\n\nIf you ride the bull as a guy, the operator tries to throw you as quickly as possible.  For girls, however, they go pretty easy on you.
