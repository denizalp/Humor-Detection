Absolute worst service. After 1.5 hrs guy told us he hadn't started making pizza yet. Then I initially wrote a yelp review to which I deleted because the owner called and messaged us and harassed us, using many profanities. Extremely unprofessional, nobody ever go to this place unless u are willing to risk being harassed by the owner . And btw, we never did get our pizza, had to cancel after 1.5 hrs. I do have a screenshot of what he messaged to us if anybody would like to see.
