I do not exactly know why Casey's mission in life is to piss off their customers and serve terrible food, always, every time, every location...\n\nWith that said, this is so far one of the better locations that I have found. The food is always hit and miss here. Staff always seem to be too busy to serve you and are not very happy and cheerful. Its like you are personally bothering them by coming and expecting to get service while you try too enjoy at best edible meal... \n\nI like the penne pasta, which is a simple pasta dish with peppers, and somehow I ended up without the peppers, its the whole reason I order this dish, the peppers are a nice touch and yet I was being blamed for asking it without the peppers! Even when the manager came, she could have cared less and looked annoyed to have to crawl out of her hiding place..\n\nIf you are lucky enough your meal will come out right the first time!
