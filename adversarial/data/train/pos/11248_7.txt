I've been to this airport  for domestic flights before but flying in from Panama through this airport is a completely different story. I got to see different parts of the airport that I never saw before. Going through immigration\/customs was a breeze with a really short line and everything was straight forward. If you have Global Entry, there are machines for you to use and you're set right afterwards. \n\nThis airport is much bigger than I realized and we had to walk quite a ways to get a cab to our hotel, but I loved how it wasn't a nightmare of a mess like LAX. There were even several options to dine in the airport and several places to shop. \n\nI think I might try to fly in internationally into this airport from now on. It's so much nicer than LAX.
