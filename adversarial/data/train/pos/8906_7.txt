I am reviewing as I'm eating...nom..nom..nom. Why? Umiya event. Show them a review that you're happy and get a Umiya mug. Well, I'm beyond happy! The sushi was 4\/5 but the service was above and beyond spectacular, 6\/5! So many staff members checking on you and your drinks. Keep the Asahi coming. \n\nAs for the speed of the food coming to your table, wow, blazing fast! Ok, we orders A LOT OF food and thought it would take a while. Nope. Super fast. Thank goodness because the wait was about 40 mins. Well worth it. Talk about hard to find good AYCE sushi places. None exist in Seattle. Sorry Todai but you weren't that good even when you were open. So, next time I'm in Vegas and craving sushi, here we come Umiya!
