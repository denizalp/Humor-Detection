Modern Steak screams cool. It just does. The exterior, the interior, the vibe, the colors...everything screams cool. \n\nFood: I've tried a variety of food options here yet surprisingly, never the steak.Their burgers are amazing. I know what you're thinking. What's so different about the Modern Steak burger? Well...it's on a sweet and soft roll, it has some great special sauce and the meat is great quality. Their fries are salty and delicious. And how do I even subscribe the chopped salad? Well, chopped it is but it's full of every great veggie on this planet...including avocado. \n\n\nDecor: I could probably hang out at Modern Steak all night and be completely happy. The white and blue accents and the atmosphere makes you feel so fresh and so clean. I heard the decor is copied after the Marie Antoinette movie and I think she'd be very proud. From the lighting to the trendy furniture, it's got an awesome vibe. And the bathrooms. Well gentlemen....when your girl is MIA, before you call the cops, check the bathrooms. Fully equipped with couches, this is the bathroom I wish I could copy and place in my own house. I actually wish I could copy the entire Modern Steak decor for my home. \n\nHappy Hour: I don't know how long this is lasting, but right now they are having the most amazing happy hour! $5 drinks and $2 food items. Yes, I said it correctly....two dollars!! An awesome meal and drinks for $10? Yep, that's what you can do at Modern Steak right now! \n\nSo in summary, this is a great location for a night out with friends, a nice date, if you want to grab some drinks at the trendy bar or you want to relax and lounge of the comfortable patio...you've got to check out Modern Steak!
