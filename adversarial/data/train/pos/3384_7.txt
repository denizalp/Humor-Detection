Valley Metro:\n\nWhen you go on strike, do you know who you're fucking over?  Poor people who have no other way to get to work.  What are you striving for each time you strike?  Your drivers are consistently rude and nasty and your buses are always late.  Whenever a bus arrives on time, it's probably actually the bus that should have been arriving 20 minutes ago.  Since the last time, nothing in the way of service had improved.  Rather, it had gotten worse.\n\nDo you know how many times an Orbit in Tempe has almost run me over when I'm riding my bike?  When my girlfriend called to complain about it, the operator said something like, \"Oh, him.  We know all about HIM!\" Yet, he was allowed to work there and continue endangering the lives of how many people?  Ridiculous.\n\nUntil you can get the buses to run on time and not treat customers like shit (seriously, the way you guys treat riders sometimes is ridiculous; my ass would get fired for that in a damn minute), please don't abandon the people who NEED and REQUIRE your service.  I understand working conditions suck, you have to drive crackheads and everything, but fuck.  You guys are the worst.  You're mean and you've left so many people high and dry again and again and again.
