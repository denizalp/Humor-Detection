My colleague and I decided to have an early dinner here because we both love Thai food and wanted to try a place with an out-of-the-ordinary atmosphere. The staff was friendly and attentive and we were seated immediately; the place was spacious enough to be able to accommodate a significant dinner crowd. The lengthy layout and projected anime on the walls gave the place a modern informal vibe. Being able to arrive early enough to take advantage of happy hour prices was a plus for this visit. The food was flavorful, well-presented, and reasonably priced for the quality.
