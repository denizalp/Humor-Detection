I went to Red Rock Canyon while vacationing in Las Vegas. It was a short drive from the Las Vegas Strip (if no traffic). It's best to go early (IMO) to avoid high heat and large crowds mid day unless you want to see the sunset. You're able to drive through the canyon for a flat fee (per vehicle). There are destinations were you can park and take photos\/hike. The beauty of the canyons were breathtaking. I really enjoyed my time visiting Red Rock Canyon National Conservatory. This was a memorable experience for me. Definitely put Red Rock Canyons on your bucket list, if you're looking for something to do outside of the Vegas Strip. If you go to TallTravelEats on YouTube, you're able to see some parts of the beautiful canyon scenery.
