I could swear I've written reviews for Marshall's in the past.  Well, maybe it was a different branch.  \n\nOn my way to Red Rock for my freebie weekend prize (yeah, right, as long as I spend at least $5), I stopped at Marshall's to pick up a yoga mat.  They had a decent selection ranging in price from $10-15, based on thickness.  And while I was there, who could resist a pair of Sam Edelman shortie boots, especially since they had fringes and were reduced by a 1\/3?  And a recycled glass holder for $4, for the bamboo plant I'm desperately trying to salvage with rocks and water?\n\nPrices aren't often cheap.  The upscale $100+ handbags are now tethered with cords that you can pull out to check out the bag, along with a button to press if you want a salesperson to release it so you can buy it.  A neat system to prevent theft, it will work fine as long as there are sufficient employees on the floor to help.  Though I didn't need an expensive handbag, I was surprised and pleased to see that there were more salespeople visible and walking around than Macy's, Kohl's Sears and Ross combined.  But that would be an easy record to beat, since those stores no longer seem to remember that concept.\n\nThe one thing that really pissed me off was the inability to take the cart out of the store.  It locks as soon as you push it through the first set of exit doors.  A salesperson said that this is Clark County regulations.  Really?????  How come BB&B and Ross - and all supermarkets - have their carts lined up outside the stores or in the parking lots?  This is a major inconvenience for anyone with a full wagon, seniors, or the handicapped.  Just on principle I may insist on someone carrying my packages to my car next time I shop here.  It sure dampered my enthusiasm.
