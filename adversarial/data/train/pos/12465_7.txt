I called Spruce Tree and talked to Julia, who is very knowledgable about strings for instruments. Definitely knows a lot.\n\nShe asked what kind of ukulele I was wanting restrung, I told her it was an Oscar Schmidt (it's an OU3), proceeded to tell me the many ways why those are junk. They don't sound good, they are made out of the wrong kind of wood, etc. Fine, yes, I am aware that it is neither the greatest nor most expensive ukulele in the world. I think it sounds pretty darn good, but opinions are like buttholes, we all have one.\n\nWe discussed a very specific kind of string that I wanted, fluorocarbon strings, for my less than impressive ukulele.\n\nI still wanted these strings, so she said $7 for the strings, $10 for the labor and then tax. I said great, I'll be there in about 20 minutes. \n\nSo I head on down there. Have you ever been in say like a jewelry store and you're not looking great or wearing your best, and the salesperson has a non-overt, but a detectable type of adverse attitude toward you? Same thing with this woman.\n\nI get there and take out my uke, hand it to her and at this point it is also too heavy for her liking. I am thinking Oh.My.God, I must be on Candid Camera.\n\nThen they don't have the strings we were talking about, LESS than AN HOUR BEFORE. Don't you think you could turn your head around and check, before I drive all the way there from VERONA? Sorry, but DUH.\n\nBut gas is free (right?) and I have nothing better to do than waste my time, quite a bit of it apparently with construction messes on Fish Hatch I had to navigate.\n\nMaybe they do great work, who knows? But this lady's attitude sucked and oh my gosh, seriously? You didn't check for the strings that are right behind the counter knowing full well I am stopping in? No, really? really? *facepalm*\n\nSorry about my pal good ol' Oscar. I don't feel the need to make any excuses for him. He is just like me, kinda crappy, but doing his best to be the best ukulele that he can be with what was given to him. \n \nI still want the strings, but I am not going back there. I am not and will never be a music snob. That kind of pettiness in no way represents what the spirit of music means to me.
