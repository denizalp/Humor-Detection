It's just called City Church now. It used to be a good church, but the pastor got ideas bigger than his abilities.  When he tried to make it into a dynastic megachurch things fell apart because of a scandal involving his hand-picked pastor, It doesn't look like it ever quite recovered. It couldn't keep up its Christian school either and recently merged with another one.  If it were still like it was in the early-mid 70s when it had 150-200 members, I'd give it 4 1\/2 or maybe even 5 stars. Now I'm hard pressed to give it 2.
