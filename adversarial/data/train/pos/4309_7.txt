Yes, this is a chain donut spot and I should be supporting mom\/pop shops around the valley. But honestly, I love Winchell's donuts; more so than all the other chain donut shops. \n\nI'm a purist when it comes to donuts. I hate all the fancy shmancy bs that's on donuts these days. I enjoy the classic glazed and sometimes the occasional chocolate dipped donut. Their donuts are doughy and soft. I freaking love them so much. \n\nThey are attached to a Subway so you can get your lunch and dessert afterwards. We stopped in to grab some breakfast while in the area and went a little overboard on our ordering. I wish there was one closer to my side of town, but then again I'm glad they aren't because I'd turn into a cow.
