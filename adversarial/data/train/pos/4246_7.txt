tucked in a little corner of downtown lakewood where you'd probably miss it if you weren't looking, the place to be sits and waits for you to take notice.\n\nthis is a homey breakfast stop.  families come here, regulars come here, and you should too.  cheap eats for breakfast, and the food isn't super greasy. good eggs.  filling hash browns.  \n\nand if you're weird like me and like to eat breakfast food at other times in the day...they serve breakfast all day.\n\nit's kinda small, and they pack 'em in on the weekends.  \n...that's what she said.\nsnuck that one in there.\n\nbut check this place out.
