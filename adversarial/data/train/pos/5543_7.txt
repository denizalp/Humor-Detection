This would have been a 5 star review but unfortunately they open at 7am, we came in at 9:40am and they did not have the CK Monkey Bread ready and we were told it would not be ready for another 45 minutes????\n\nOverall we really like this place, the food is good, the staff are all amazing and they do what they can to serve organic and fresh foods, all here in Henderson....\n\nFinally a great place on this side of town.  The ambiance is really cool, the deserts and sweets, OMG.  They keep them right in front so when you walk in the front door to be seated you see the 3 counter spaces filled with them.....\n\nThis is a place I highly recommend as they are amazing and really needs our support, although like I said there is nothing else like this on this side of town so they should not have any issues.
