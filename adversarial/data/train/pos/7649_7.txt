Had the unpleasant experience of visiting  food bar\/cafeteria the other evening. My wife and I approached the bar and were asked by the attendant what we wanted. My wife first asked for a ham sandwich and was told we don't have ham sandwiches. We walked down the line further and found ham and bread. My wife made a ham sandwich after going through the bread, as some of the bread had mold on it. We returned to the front of the line and after a few moments the attendant returned from the rear. My wife asked for a BLT and was told \"ain't got no bacon!\". She then left and walked through a door to the back area. Attendant acted like her shoes were too tight. She seemed very unhappy and snapped back with her answers. She returned shortly and appeared disturbed that we were still there. \n We ordered chili dogs as everything else looked very unappealing. Everything was soaking in water and looked old. We finally payed for our food and went to dining area to eat. Chili dogs were appealing but alas they were cold. Chili was cold and hotdog was cold. My wife told me to take it back, but I declined to face that attendant's attitude again. I ate it as I had not eaten since breakfast and it was now 10:30pm.\n To top off my dining experience, two hospital employees were talking on their cell speaker phone, laughing and yelling into the phone. This was a joy. \n No customer service here! Your trapped and screwed.
