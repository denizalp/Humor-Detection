What a horrible experience!!!!!!  While we were eating midway a cockroach appears on a divider, about 10 inches   away from my friend's face.  Unfortunately I dined with human but not frogs so we did not ordered it as part of the meal.  She screamed and jumped, we immediately evacuate the area while the wait staffs did not seem to care what has happened.  The poor little six legged critter must have scared shitless and lose it foot, fell onto a spanking new Mackage jacket that was bought couple weeks ago.  Ouch!!!! \n\nWe were standing around, no one came to ask about our well being so I went on a search mission to find that thing, it was clinging onto the jacket tight that I need to shake it off, there it goes underneath the seat and live and breed in the restaurant happily thereafter.  The waitress saw it but did not say a word, I waited for a minute and finally I have to ask for the manager.  He came by, did not show any sign of remorse of giving us such an experience, and offered us another table which is right in front of the one that the cockroach was hiding.  Needless to say we declined it and waned out.  The manager offered us a 10% discount which is a joke and I kindly commented on how we are still midway on our lunch.  Then the waitress came back and offered us 20%, which is still a joke but we are not here to haggle for a free meal so we paid and get out.\n\nAfter we left, at the door there is a sign shows that this restaurant has a conditional pass on the last health inspection.  For a restaurant that serves uncooked food I found my experience completely unacceptable.  It's just bad that we have to learnt it the hard way.
