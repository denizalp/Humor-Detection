I would give this 0 stars if it would let me.  Office staff is terrible,  nasty attitude and a general don't give a crap. Arrived at 1pm with forms already completed,  50 minutes later i find out he is running an hour behind,  and I can choose to wait or leave. If this doctor didn't come highly recommended and I hadn't already waited a month for an appointment I would have left.  Hopefully the other offices aren't this bad.
