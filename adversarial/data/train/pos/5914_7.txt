What more could you want in a breakfast place? Delicious breakfast food, pancakes, french toast, eggs, and good coffee (hard to come by in this type of restaurant environment)!\n\nService is very, very fast. We have been coming here 2x per week lately because we drop my older daughter off at choir practice before school and have an hour to kill before the other one gets dropped off. I can't think of a better way to kill time than at Butterfield's.
