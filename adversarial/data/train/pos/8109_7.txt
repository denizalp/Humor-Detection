Hello friends,\n\nWell, this place has been open for almost 2 months. I've been waitin 4 someone to try it out and review it before I tried butttttt no one did, soooo here I Am!!\n\nI finally used this advertisement that was placed on my door. (Free Pizza...LG Deep Dish 1 Topping.  No purchase necessary) \n\nI was out and about so instead of delivery I did carry-out. When I walked in (Sporting my OHIO STATE shirt, I was greeted with a big smile from Joseph) he simply greeted me with O-H. When I heard that, I  replied with I-O!! I KNEW I WAS N A GOOD PLACE. \n\nNo problem with my Free pizza coupon asked if I wanted to order anything else so I did. Honey BBQ wings. Waited bout 15-20 mins. \n\nI'm what one may call ummm how do you say, a food lush, greedy! I'll just say my mom called me Yum Yum Eat em Up when I was younger. \n\nSaying that, to say before I backed out of the parking lot I inhaled a wing. Slap Yo Momma good. When I made it back I opened up the pizza box and was happy to see some good oowee goowee cheesy pizza. I will say the sauce (like in other reviews for the other locations) was missing I'd say a Pinch to a Punch of salt. It wasn't bad, but wasn't the greatest. I will def be back. They offer a few different types of crust. (Like HH Pizza) \n\nThere are a number of 4 seat tables. Some in the front and more to the back. The front section looks more appealing due to the big windows. Drink machine and two tv's (nice BIG TV's). Now the next problem ill have is where to take a nap, but that's NOT their fault. Like I said, I was called Yum Yum Eat em Up. \n\nTTFN
