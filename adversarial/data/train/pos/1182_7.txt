These days anyone can open a club.  So I expected something special from the Wynn.  THINK AGAIN\n\nGot a table for a special event.  They put us on the PATIO because we spent less than $12,000.  I am actually embarrassed to disclose the amount we spent. The server was nice but with bottle service, they are really not doing much work.  Before that everyone we encountered was an ass. \n\nAlso, what good is having a table at a club if you are not IN THE CLUB.  For the amount we spent, we could have flown to NYC and been at a real club, where the people are actually cool, the environment was authentic, not \"Vegas Authentic\"  \n\nI complained to the Wynn. They essentially said \"tough luck but please come back\" in corporate language. I guess I am not influential enough for them to care. \n\n\nIt's a rip off.  Don't go.
