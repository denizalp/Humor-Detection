KBBQ in Toronto is meh as fuck but this place is the meh-est of the meh. I don't care how extensive your menu is if everything on it tastes like chalk. The Chako in Richmond Hill used to be good when it first open but everything since then went to shit. I don't even bother ordering the sushi. Compared to the KBBQ in Cali: They have barely any side dishes. Meat quality is not worth the price. It's rubbery and tough, and no matter how you cook it, it's hard to chew. If you think the marinated meat here tastes anywhere close to good, then I pity your virgin taste buds. They often cut the pieces too thick and it tastes like it's been sitting out. \n\nDon't get me started on service. My friends and I are speaking English so the middle-aged female manager thinks we don't understand Canto and rudely tells our server right in front of us to get us to leave because our time is up. First of all, we had 20 minutes left on our 2 hour seating limit. Second, your restaurant had plenty of empty tables so it's not as if any potential customers are waiting. \n\nIf it was up to me, I wouldn't have even come here after it closed down for food safety violations (insect infestation) in 2014.
