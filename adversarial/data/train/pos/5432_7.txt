The food is great, the service sucks.\n\nWe were in on the evening of 12\/01, and there were only two other couples in the restaurant.  Neither the waitress, nor the bartender gave a sh*t about the customers.  At one point, they were both outside chatting and we had to get up and go to the kitchen and ask for missing items.  \n\nUnless they get their act together, they won't be around long.
