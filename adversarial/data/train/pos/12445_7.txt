I haven't gone inside this gas station. I've only tanked up outside. It usually pretty empty. If not having to deal with a lot of people is your thing then you might want to stop by this station. The gas prices are average but not the cheapest. If you are looking for the best deal in town, I'd suggest going elsewhere.
