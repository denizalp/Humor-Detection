SERVICE NIGHTMARE! My TDI Jetta only has 45K miles and ran great before taking it here. I got a engine warning light that the manual described as an emission related issue. I put it off for 3 months before taking it in. The car continued to run great. MPG great, power great, no issues except the dash light. The service manager Thomas had a computer diagnostics test ran and came back with a glow plug wiring harness short. The car hadn't had any issues related to starting or glow plugs but I decided to go ahead and have the harness replaced for $700 just to get rid of that little yellow light. After several days to get the part from CA, and install, he called to say THAT problem was fixed but NOW there's another. Now the engine warning light was STILL ON due to a turbo vein position sensor error. No worries though, he could give me the new $3000 turbo for $2500. Again, there was nothing wrong with my 45K mile turbo when I brought the car in. AND neither issue had anything to do with emissions? There is no doubt that these people caused the turbo sensor fault while they were working on it. Why didn't  the code show up initially along with the supposed glow plug harness fault? Cant believe they wont warranty a 45K mile turbo or their work. They said the turbo is fine but the sensor is embedded and has to be replaced as a whole for the bargain price of $2500. When I declined the service and picked up my car, the bracket for the electronic control module was laying on the passenger floor mat. When I pointed that out, Thomas had service take the car back and re-install it. Cant imagine driving away with the cars computer flopping around unsupported. The next day I noticed that they mounted the windshield wipers incorrectly so they sweep past the windshield! Now a week later, MY TURBO STOPPED WORKING! I cant emphasize what a scam this place is for service. I'm writing a letter to corporate VW with no expectations of them fixing anything. Please don't go here for service!
