5 stars for an undoubtedly 5 star hotel! Slightly more modern than the Wynn, this sister property boasts beautiful reds and golds with a butterfly motif that melds together to form a warm, inviting environment. The rooms are huge, the beds are super comfortable, and the hotel itself overall is immaculate.
