I have been by this place several times now. Also now that I am far more aware of what I am eating, I pay attention.\nSo today I went in. I found out this place has been here for 10 years.\nIt is a bakery, as well as an Eat in or to go dinner.\nSo much to choose from in here as well.\nBread, cookies, bagels,Pizza dough,muffins, etc, etc, etc...\n\nI also really like that you can buy your own mixes on everything and make it your self if you so want to do it.\nMenu for meals is great and when you see all the food places they supply to you will be surprised as well.\nThe even sell all types of cakes. You can order them form the book complete with decorations.\nIt is not all too cheap in here. But, A little extra effort is worth the extra price ,I think.\nWhen we are all swelling up like Balloons changing your diet can do wonders.\nI will be happy to come back here. Yeah, for a great find!
