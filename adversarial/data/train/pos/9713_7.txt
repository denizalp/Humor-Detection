3.5 stars. Came for a corporate event and got to drive 4 laps around the track.\n\nWhen you come in, you check in with your driver's license and you get a mini flash drive that will be used to record your video. You sign the waiver and wait for them to call you into the briefing room where they run a video on the basics and go over some safety rules. After that you go out on a short drive with one of their drivers as he goes over the course. Be warned, the driver is professional and will drive super fast in an SUV!\n\nI was told in the years past that you can line up and have a shot at choosing what car you want to drive. This year, everything was pre-assigned which was hella lame. I got stuck with the Mercedes AMG. While not a bad car, I was expecting \"exotic\" cars like a Ferrari or Lamborghini. The only way I could have driven one of those cars was to swap with the person assigned to that car. Let's be honest, who in the right mind who swap a Ferrari for an AMG? :\/\n\nInside the car, the mirrors are set up for your instructor to use. They just want you to look forward and not worry about other cars coming. The instructor I had was really nice and accommodating, especially because I had no prior track experience. He pushed me to go faster and faster, and by the last lap, I was smashing the throttle. Too bad 4 laps goes by way too fast, especially in these cars.\n\nWould I come back? Maybe. It's starting at $99 for 2 laps. With these cars, you'd be spending the first lap or lap and a half just getting used to the car and track. It's pricey as hell. If you have the money though, I'd recommend this place. Just book the car you want to drive in advance, so you don't get stuck with something you don't want to drive.
