Quite the little dive this is. Tiny, local and with a nice 'hidden' vibe to it, although everyone and their communist's daughter know about. Ha! An existential plug homerun!\n\nAnyway, place is tiny, cheap and they have live music from time to time. \nVery retro in decour with a few circa's 50's chairs. So basically it feels like this place was ripped out of Queen west and dropped magically on Dundas West.   \n\nHipsters, locals, artists, students, and blue-collars are this place's bread and butter clients since the place has that rugged, kinda of dirty, old and yet friendly aura to it. Not to mention the food on the tiny menu is all like $7. Also they do live bands on the weekends. I only know this because my friend's Rosenman's brother Roberto plays the trumpet there from time to time.  \n\nAs I have only been to this localed during the weekdays when for some reason or another found myself here.
