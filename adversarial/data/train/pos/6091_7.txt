My husband isn't one to usually complain... Unlike me, my husband is a mild tempered Southern gentleman, and will ignore sheer ignorance from people.  Me, not so much...being a Jersey girl, born and raised I have, and will continue to speak my mind especially for IGNORANCE & INJUSTICE!\n\nWhen he went to pickup his laundry after work on 06\/18\/13...while waiting in line he notice how friendly the counter employee was to the women in front of him, but how her demeanor immediately changed upon him reaching the counter to be helped.  She displayed VERY poor customer service, which is a pet peeve of mine!  It pissed my husband off, but he just paid for his clothes, poor customer service included, left and said \"They lost my business! \n\nNEWSFLASH:  Remember \"Pretty Women\" when the sales women treated Julia Roberts with such disrespect and loathing?  Don't judge a book by its cover...you just NEVER know what lays deeper!  Premier Cleaners...YOU just LOST a customer who was more then able, and willing to pay your HIGH prices for dry cleaning just for the convenience... But, what we WON'T pay for is sheer rudeness and DISRESPECT in the process!!  \n\nIf the young lady who worked the counter should read this, I don't know if your reason for such poor customer service was due to my husband's skin color, (Let's hope NOT) or you were mad at your boyfriend\/husband and hated men in general that day.  Regardless of the reason, you should ALWAYS leave your personal drama at the entrance door when dealing with the public...or stay in the back away from customers! Treating your customers EQUALLY, with HUMAN KINDNESS, and a smile goes a long way!\n\nFinally, MUST give the young lady who worked the counter when we dropped off our clothes KUDOS!  She was VERY customer service oriented :-) Thanks for your professionalism, wish you had been there when we picked up!  \n\nThanks,\n\nMs. Minority w\/Klount
