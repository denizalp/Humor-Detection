We dined there the first week open and thought the food ranged from very good to good. The Chef was kind enough to come to our table to describe the special. I will go into detail on the plates after another visit or so but it may take some convincing to get my spouse back any time soon...\n\nThe reason for 3 instead of 4 stars: Last week my wife stopped by after a long day of work for \"walk-in and order take out\" and had an unreasonable wait of one hour - she went shopping for 20 minutes, returned and then went home before returning. The person taking order on the tablet seemed unfamiliar with the system which may have contributed but not the only reason. Wife was offered 10% discount but she had already paid and did not want additional delay.\n\nShe observed all tables being waited on by the same overworked person that handled us on first visit and we had the impression she had no wait staff experience at all but I hope she succeeds. \n\nI do want chime in to say that there needs to be better coordination between the front and the kitchen.\n\nI have a feeling there is some great food here already, deserving better service, and hope the best for this restaurant.
