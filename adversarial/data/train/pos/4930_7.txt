Here I sit, broken-hearted, Came for my 'script and then I started... counting times I've been here this week, rolling my eyes, hearing brakes squeak. This line, the cars, the endless que!  Can't hold it inside, so I write this review- CVS if you're listening, and I hope that you are, please take this request that I send from my car: HURRY UP!!!!!!!!!!\nGood lord this drive thru is slow!!!
