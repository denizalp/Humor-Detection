I've been waiting for this location to open up for months every time I drove by and honestly gave up checking after a while. Suddenly, I received a phone call from a friend who confirmed that this location was officially opened. We were so excited to give it a try the same week. \n\nWhen we first arrived, the tables were so dirty that we ended up switching the table ourselves. 10 minutes later, our waitress finally showed up. She seemed lost and hardly showed up at first. After our friend arrived, a different person showed up to help our waitress out. From that point forward, the service was becoming great again. \n\nThe food portion is generous and I do love their side dishes. Their cold noodle was absolutely delicious. If you like all you can eat BBQ, this is a good place to go. I will most definitely come back here again with friends.
