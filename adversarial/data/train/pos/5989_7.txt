***My 200th Review*** \n\n\nIf you want to feel like royalty, then ladies throw on a gown, and gentlemen please put on a suit, and visit Joel Robuchon.  This is an event.  The restaurant is decorated like an eccentric frenchman got a hold of Elton John's Amex, and binged.  Its truly amazing, and I pray to G-d that my home is a fraction as cool as the royal purple that engulfed me that night.\n\nI was lucky enough to experience the Dégustation which was totally, and utterly customized to my allergies.  No egg, no dairy, no wheat, no seafood or shellfish.  I also set my reservation about three weeks in advance to give the kitchen time to prepare for substitutions.  There was no additional charge, or qualms.  \n\nAfter ordering a bottle of wine, a cart arrived with about 20 different types of breads, pretzels, brioche... *sigh*.  It was simply beautiful.  Although I didn't sample any, my dining companion wolfed down probably 8 different kinds of breads happily.  \n\nMy 3 favorite dishes in order that they arrived:\n \nLa Tomate-en salade, huile d'olive au basilic, tomate et mozzarella en gelée - like a cold cold caprese party in your mouth \n\nLes Asperges- royale tremblotante de morille au vin d'Arbois - asparagus with fantastic morel mushrooms\n\nLes Petits Pois - en fin velouté rafraîchi à la menthe poivrée sur un voile d'oignon doux - a soup of peas with an interesting onion foam\n\nIts amazing how simple on the palate can turn into something so incredibly satisfying.  Remember to take your time... \n\nCourse after course arrived, and we killed 2 bottles of wine.  Its called a tasting menu for a reason.  I remember liking everything with beef, and the vegetables were insanely crisp, yet well seasoned, and the colours were so vibrant.  Each new course had us 'oooh-ing' and 'awwww-ing' in complete ecstasy.  I believe the bone marror took the cake... Despite the price making the Dégustation a once (maybe twice) in a lifetime experience, I do believe it was worth every single dollar.  \n\nThe best part was the dessert cart.  Its like something out of Willy Wonka, if Willy was really Joel, and you were really 10 years old again.  The light that shines out your eyes after spying a cart of chocolate and sweets can only be described as lust for another tickling of your palate that I have not experienced since.\n\nI wish I could fully articulate how much I truly loved this restaurant, and more so this experience.  The staff is .. well French... yet, knowledgeable, and were extremely concerned for my well being, and sensitive to my allergies.  Dinner took about 4 and a half hours, and I'd do it again in a heartbeat. \n\nUpon leaving I was gifted with a menu to remind me of my recent gluttony, and a HUGE dense lemon cake.  It was large enough to feed at least 8 people, and I did, indeed snack on this cake for the entire time I was in Vegas.  It was a sweet reminder of a meal I shall never, ever forget.
