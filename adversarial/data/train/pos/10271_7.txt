Don't be intimidated by the line up! Trust me, it moves fast. This old school fashioned ice cream joint is everything it should be! Cute, quaint, efficient and it's got treats galore! No real indoor seating but it has plenty of outdoor picnic tables (some with umbrellas) for you to enjoy a frozen treat on a beauty day or even a hot and sticky day... There's nothing wrong with enjoying something cold and sweet when it's hot outside. That's actually the best time to treat yourself! \n\nOh and they also have hotdogs, hamburgers, fries... You know, those types of awesome goodies too! :)
