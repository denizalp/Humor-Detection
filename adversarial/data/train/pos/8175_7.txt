Awww, Smashburger, where do I start?  I really want to love you but I just don't.  You are ok, but just not so special in my book.\n\nI have been going on and off to Smashburger for a couple of years because my sister is in love with SB.  The burgers are ok and will get the job done, but that is about it.  They do have several speciality burgers, with the Sin City burger being the highlight of the menu.  They have recently added a new Truffle Mushroom burger to the menu.  I tried it the last time I was there and I was so disappointed by the burger.  It was smothered in truffle oil which completely overwhelmed the whole burger, as well as made it super oily.  Oh well, I guess I will just stick with the Sin City burger from here on out.\n\nI don't know if this is true for you or not, but the fries are super important to any burger experience in my book.  The fries here are so-so at best.  Fries are super skinny and almost always extremely greasy, in a bad way.   They just don't have much fry flavor for me, but rather just frying oil.  Yuck.\n\nThe side item that saves Smashburger for me are the Haystack Onions.  These qualify for the status of statuses know as \"Oh My Goodness FANTASTIC!\"  I could eat 3 baskets full of them I think.  They are crunchy, flavorful, and finger lickin' good.  Yummy!\n\nOverall, Smashburger is ok when you want something nicer than the drive-thru place, but not my go to place by any means.
