WATER! We all need it and we can't live without it. These people have the power to turn on your water and turn it off! In all my years of dealing with the LVVWD, I have always received outstanding customer service! When I have moved, they easily disconnect and reconnect with no issues. I usually pay my bill online but on the occasion I forget, I know I can drive to the office and customer service allows me to pay my bill quickly and efficiently.\nToday was one of those days. As I walked in I noticed that they now have a kiosk which allows you to pay your bill. I thought I would try it but for some reason, the machine did not like my credit card??? I ended up waiting approximately ten minutes to pay my bill and when I approached the window, I was treated kindly and with respect. I expressed to the agent the issues I experienced with the kiosk. She then let her manager know that I was the second person today that had problems. She apologized for the inconvenience of having to wait. This is one utility company that I enjoy interacting with because of the quality customer service I receive.
