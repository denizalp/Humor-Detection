Yes, this place is the spot.\n\nThe fast casual approach to udon. All of the noodles are made in house so you know it's fresh. There is an open kitchen where you can see everything being made. The system is really easy to understand when ordering. The udon soups are really great. The noodles are amazing, and the broths they use are very good. They even have really creative udon dishes like carbonara and seafood tomato.\n\nCafe Sanuki also has tempura. They were light and crispy. If you don't want udon, you can get a rice bowl. I tried the pork belly bowl, it was quite good. Hopefully they will carry oden soon, that stuff is awesome. \n\nThe service was awesome, everyone was super friendly and eagar to assist.\n\nI will definitely be back, this is a great idea, and the food is quick and really well done.
