What is going on at this location?  The staff is always different from server's to managers and they get worse and worse with every visit. Shawna is a joke, I thought she was a hostess for the longest time until I commented about my Stuffed Chicken Marsla, tasting awful, her reply was \"Well I'm sorry you feel like that, what else do you want?\" That wasn't the point and her tone was very offensive. Needless to say I don't think I will be back, for a while, if any one knows where \nBritney, Raymond, Tyler, Jennifer, Michael Jefferson, Amanda, went too let me know so I can come back and be treated with respect.
