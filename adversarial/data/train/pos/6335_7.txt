Fresh Made Italian\n\nAs the title states, it is what it is. Great authentic Italian cuisine! We were out this evening exploring a new restaurant (we picked it from yelp), for our favorite smiling face, Tiffany (she got old today). Since our Princess, Tiffany, always wants to eat  Italian and always eats Bucca De Peppo, or whatever it is called. This Jedi is not down with the Bucca's & Olive Gardens of the world... this Jedi needs something fresh...not out of a bag.\n\nI Started with upgrading the salad to a Caesar Salad...it's an Italian Joint you have to bang on a Caesar. And like I thought, a great homemade Caesar, with crisp romaine lettuce. The perfect amount of anchovy, superb! \n\nI'm not big on eating pasta out..heavy+filling= sleepy. But Joseph's makes their or his own  pasta...I'm in. I went with the Tenne Shrimp & Jumbo Lump Crab. Mouthwatering... is what I have to say. The Shrimp huge and cooked perfect, the jumbo lump sweet and it is well balanced with a fresh stewed tomato basil cream sauce. The \"Tenne\" had me confused...for I have never heard of this pasta...it was triangle, penne to Tenne...very clever Joseph. The wifey went with the Veal Picatta... I'm not a big lemon caper butter sauce kinda guy... but his was definitely fresh as fresh could be, and the wife enjoyed. Tiffany went with the Chicken Picatta to mirror the veal, and she equally enjoined hers. Ritter went with a meatball dish with a small, very long,  lasagna noodle... very different. Also very fresh.\n\nNow the delight of the night... Creme Burlee ... I LOVE CREME BURLEE. This was one of the best I have ever had. 2nd to only Emeril's himself. Touche Mr. Tamablini, you have opened a great restuarant. I will highly recommend and tell others to dine at your establishment.\n\nJEDI RECOMMENDED\n\n--- The fact that Tambelli's (Joseph's) is located in a old Pittsburgh Home....makes it well.......homey...
