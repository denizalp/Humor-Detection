When I first moved to Vegas, Boulder Station was my go to place to hang out.  We would watch fights, football, baseball and basket ball games in the Sports book.  I have always liked the bar there as well.  After a while we would move over to the Kixx Bar and listen to some really awful karaoke.  I like the restaurants as well.  The Broiler makes a good steak.  Guadalajara (name has changed now) had pretty decent Mexican food w\/ a salsa bar.  I miss the to go Chinese food that was there next to Starbucks.  I forgot the name but they would pile up the portions and almost dare you to try and finish it.  Gambling there is what it is... the rewards card is like anywhere else, the more you play the more points you get.  I have been getting kind of bored with gambling and maybe spend $20 a week just to pass some time and to get out of my house.  Now, on to my review from today's check in:\n\nI like how Boulder Station is freeway close which makes it easy for me to meet clients.  I sell guitars and amplifiers that I fix up and \/ or modify.  And, then sell them online.  So, I usually meet my customers in a public place.  Boulder Station is a good place to do that.\n\nSo, today, I was early and decided to walk around the Casino to see what, if anything has changed.  For all that I can tell, the only difference is a change in slots.  The set up has been the same for as long as I can remember.  I don't know if that is a good or bad thing.  \n\nThe negative thing that I have to say about Boulder Station is the Seediness of the area.  There's a lot of homeless hanging around asking for change.  Prostitutes approaching you and asking you if you are alone and to see if you want to pay for some herpes.  But, it is what it is and I can live with it.  So, Boulder Station is A-OK!
