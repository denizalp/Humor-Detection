In keeping with my review that Main Street reminds me of Titanic. The Garden Court Buffet adds an element of old fashioned cafe with an ambience of the Edwardian era with modern influences. Among the buffers in the Downtown area, this Buffet is the better one if not the best. They have a descent variety of different dishes representing American, Mexican and Asian with Hawaiian influences. \n\nA cool aspect of this buffet is the build your pasta station, which to my suprise was good. Throughout out the years I have been coming here, the servers are usually good but sometimes they lack in good and consistent customer service. However, for the value and price point. This Buffet is a good option especially if your in the area and need a Buffet to fulfill an appetite. Plus, the Titanic looking ambience adds to the experience!\n\n2017 Yelp Review #65
