Just took our dog in to get his teeth cleaned and specifically asked them to call us before pulling any teeth and never heard from them all day. Went to pick our dog up to find out they pulled 3 and only told us 2 (including a front middle one)teeth with out our consent and put 4 teeth on the bill and added 70 dollars to our bill!!!! Very unprofessionaI want it to say they pulled 3 teeth, told us 2 His gums now have blisters. He gets his teeth cleaned each yr and teeth do not rot to the root in one .  And the previous vet never said his teeth were rotting. He is only 4 yrs old so this should not have happened!!\nEspecially with out a phone call!!!!
