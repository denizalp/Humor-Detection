I would rank the chicken tenders here slightly below versions at ChikFilA and Raisin' Cain but above Wingstop and McTenders. The cleanliness of the restaurant and the friendly efficiency of the employees reminded me of ChikFilA, but with different sauces and blueberry coleslaw instead of waffle fries.\n \nStandout sauces, in order, are the creamy garlic, chipotle barbeque, and the buffalo bleu. Other options include ranch, bleu cheese, honey mustard, and sweet heat. Tenders were on the smallish side, order of 3 was a bit over $4. The much-hyped blueberry coleslaw was interesting and fresh, but not really for me.\n\nExtra cool points: they have ketchup on draft at the condiment station, and Cheerwine available for purchase (a regional soda from the Carolinas).
