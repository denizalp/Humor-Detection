I had my car towed here after a blow out on the freeway. I got my car back and it broke down. Come to find out they left the radiator cap off. It took me three months to get my car back. Their insurance company covered the cost if all the damage. The price tag was $10,700! My car needed a new engine, radiator, and turbo! The mechanic at Audi said he had never seen a bill so high. Do yourself a favor and take your vehicle somewhere else. This was an absolute nightmare.
