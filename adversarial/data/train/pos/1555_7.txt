Oh how I love thee.  You really can't get better than this.  It's not gourmet, but it's not fast food either.  I usually order two meals because I can never decide what to get.  Chili three way (amazing sauce they drizzle on top) or steak burger?  This past time I decided to go out on a limb and get one of their specials, jalapeno burger.  It was a-ma-zing!  \nDon't for the shakes and of course cheese on the fries.  I'm talking cheese sauce here.
