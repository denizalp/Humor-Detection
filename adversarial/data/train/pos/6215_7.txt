I am hesitant to write this review, not because this place is bad but because I'm worried word will spread too much and I won't be able to get in. \n\nThis place is fantastic from friendly staff to quick service to great sushi. \n\nCame for dinner tonight with the girlfriend and another couple and was really impressed. The menu is huge for an all you can eat sushi place from apps to cooked food to sushi pretty much anything on a menu at a most sushi restaurants is available here and it's all AYCE. Note: there doesn't appear to be an a la carte menu for rolls. Looks like it's AYCE or bust with only drinks being extra. \n\nI was really impressed by how fresh the fish was. The salmon was melt in your mouth good and I think the yellowtail was more flavorful than most places. Nothing tasted old or had that weird fishy taste. The fact that the sashimi is available for so much stuff on AYCE is a major value and win here. \n\nWas also really impressed with the roll selection. We tried some different ones with the Sakura, NY and Out of Control being winners. Feisty Dragon was also good if you like crab. \n\nThe staff was very friendly and the service was quick. Don't think we waited more than 5-10 minutes for anything to come out.  \n\nAlso of note is that my girlfriend doesn't like seaweed so when she ordered her rolls with soy paper not only did they get it right the first time (a near rarity) but they didn't charge extra for it. \n\nAt one of the lower prices for AYCE in Phoenix and given the quality being on par with most non-AYCE places Sakura is a great find.
