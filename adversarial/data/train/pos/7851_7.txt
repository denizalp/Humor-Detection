1) There are two barristas there today, and just as I'm approaching the door, one of the two decides it's his smoke break and leaves.  How do I know he left to smoke?  Because he then stood amongst the designed Starbucks patio furniture and had his smoke break right there and then.  Wearing his Starbucks' worker T-shirt.  Does he not know the rule about smoking x-amount of feet from the door\/patio?  \n\n2) I go inside and am behind a man and his child who order the most complicated drinks on the menu, plus two paninis with specific grilling instructions.  Of course, now the one idiot behind the counter is the only one who can make these drinks and the food, because I am staring at his co-worker outside smoking.  All I want is a tall Pike.  Just pull the lever down and fill the cup, and let me hand you my toonie.\n\n3) I get my Pike eventually, and go over to the milk and sugar station, where now there are only two canisters - one says, ominously, \"MILK\" and the other \"CREAM\".  What type of milk?  What type of cream?  I go to the counter and ask the one poor schlub, \"What kind of milk and cream are out there?\"   \n\n\"The cream is half and half, and the milk is 2%.\"   \n\n\"What if I want non-fat milk?\" I ask.\n\n\"Well,\" he says, \"you have to ask for it.\"\n\nWHAT DID I JUST DO?  DID I NOT RAISE MY VOICE HIGH ENOUGH AT THE END OF THE SENTENCE FOR YOU TO REALIZE THERE WAS AN IMPLIED QUESTION MARK?\n\n\"Okay....um...can I have the non-fat milk?\"  \n\nHe leans over and hands me a container of non-fat milk and informs me, \"It's just something new we're trying out.\"\n\nIf the \"something new\" means \"no customer service\" and \"making me think Tim Hortons coffee experience is better\", well, golly, it's working.
