Ode to Zoes-by K. Ferg.\n\nBrick and mortar coffee house slash creativity venue bursting with cool ass individuals.\nShirt and shoes required, I think. But personality and character is a must.\nSit comfy, sip slowly and enjoy raw unfiltered talent.\n\nZoes (insert finger snap)\n\nI looove coming here for concerts, jam sessions and especially open mic night! This is definitely to most chillaxed place in town. No need to drive to Noda to enjoy a vibe like this. \n\nCoffee, beer, wine, food, great talent and an appreciation for creative expression?!? You can't go wrong. Love love love!!
