We had a bachelorette party the day after so we wanted to come to Vegas a day earlier just to hang out and see the show and have some good food, so where we stayed didn't matter too much. The LINQ had a great deal so we booked it, the room was sufficient, nothing special and actually pretty small for 4 people compared to other Vegas hotel rooms. The bathroom was as basic as they come.\n\nChecking in was an issue, no concierge so we had to press buttons on a screen that didn't exactly respond so well at first. Your parking ticket is another thing you need to buy and it's also automated, very confusing when you're trying to check out without your room key, so make sure you pay for your parking BEFORE you check out.\n\nThe elevators are slow, very slow and the escalator and elevators are very confusing as to where it leads to, and it's only to 3 floors! Jeez, this shouldn't be that hard but apparently it is. \n\nSufficient for a one night stay but not a place I'd stay in if I wanted to feel like I'm having a fabulous Vegas weekend.
