I came here when it was a regular summer evening - not during winterlicious or summerlicious. \n\nSuper easy to find, located on the second floor of the TIFF Bell Box. You can easily walk up through the white staircase! Walking in, many people were dressed in business casual clothing - I felt a little under dressed in a cardigan and shorts. The ambiance is bright (large glass windows on one side) and beautifully decorated. We sat by the booths where one person gets to view the whole restaurant and the other person USUALLY doesn't. I love how they install a mirror behind the person at the booth, so both sides are able to enjoy the view of the restaurant.\n\nSimilar to all of the other O&B places, food was delicious - nothing to complain about. The price of this O&B is in the middle - not as expensive as Auberge Au Pommier or Canoe, but not like their O&B Canteen or Bannock, which are their more affordable options.
