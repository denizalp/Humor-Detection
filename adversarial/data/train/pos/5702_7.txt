I just got mongrel messages from the 217 driver who deleted his account before I could reply: http:\/\/i.imgur.com\/s3gL7kr.png .\nShame he didn't realize I get email notifiers.\n\nIn response to his stupidity, I think we can all see why West Island STM is much inferior to city STM. The man admitted that he cannot even pack his lunches so he stops the bus during his route. For those of you that don't know, the 217 has 1 terminus right next to a family-like subway and a convenience store and the other one right next to a huge mall yet he feels the need to stop the bus half-way through the round while all the clients wait for him like dogs in a car.\n\nNow for my immature rant at a moron (Mitch. L.): Congratulations on a less than 30$ an hour career \"dude\". I'm in Software Engineering in Concordia. As soon as I finish my degree my hourly wage will be more than what you can get after 15 years of driving that taco around. Enjoy your sunchips while I enjoy 5-star restaurants!\n\nEDIT: Reuploading the transgressions since my pictures were reported for \"Abuse\". Nice one STM drivers.\n\n\n\n\nI'd like to excuse myself in advance for any vulgarity expressed in this review for my experience with the STM hasn't been the most pleasant.\n\nOkay so first of all I'd like to say that this review is not addressed towards DOWNTOWN STM but WEST-ISLAND's STM WHICH IS THE WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOÂ­OOOOOOOOOOORSE PIECE OF SHIT SERVICE I'VE EVER HAD!\n\nFIRST OF ALL, I'd like to talk about the 217 and the 425. During winter, for some reason, there is 1 chance out of 4 that they simply DO NOT pass. No, not that they are late by 5 minutes... they simply DO NOT COME. Once I waited for 2 425s in a row and a 217. NOBODY came and I just decided to go back home and skip class. I came late to work 3 times in 3 months because the 419 was not there and I ran to the 217 bus to get to work late. It's AWFUL.\n\nSecond of all, the drivers man... ha ha... Fuck. The 419 driver in the morning of Wednesday (12-11-13) who was not only late 10 minutes but also took the wrong turn following the 219 route and ended up doing a 15 minute detour to get to Fairview got me late for work. When I confronted him, he replied with \"Hey, it happens, what do you want me to do?\". Oh, I don't know. Maybeeeeeeee NOT READ THE JOURNAL WHILE YOU DRIVE. FUCKING RETARD. \n\nBelieve I'm pulling this out of my ass, here, have a picture.\nfbcdn-sphotos-e-a.akamai...\n\nI complained to the STM by email. I simply got a big fat \"lol ok\" from them. This is what happens when you have the monopole of something.\n\nI had bus drivers on numerous occasions that stopped in the middle of the fucking street to get something to eat at a dep! Thank you 217 bus driver for showing me that the STM sucks twice in a month. You're already late 9 minutes and you choose to stop randomly on a 1 lane road close enough to an intersection to incapacitate the circulation to buy yourself a can of Red Bull, a bag of Sunchips and a sandwich making me lose another 10 minutes then sit down at your seat for another 2 minutes to eat your fucking sandwich.\n\nhttp:\/\/i.imgur.com\/vuiEcyX.jpg\n\nWTF! \n\nHere is a picture of the 217 driver that decided to STOP IN THE MIDDLE OF A 4-WAY INTERSECTION TO HAVE A CHAT WITH THE OTHER 217 DRIVER ABOUT BAD DRIVERS. HOLY SHIT PEOPLE. Are they like elementary school drop outs or something? They moved after getting honked for 2 minutes. A guy even got out of his SUV walking rapidly towards the bus.\n\nhttp:\/\/i.imgur.com\/pBlGdXc.jpg\n\nDowntown it's almost perfect. Buses are never late or missing, metro is smooth, never had a problem with anything. In the suburbs, it is TERRIBLE.
