We go to this rest. mainly because it's between my kids school and home and there's a DQ across the parking lot.  The pizza is good (don't bother w\/ the glueten free unless you've got a bet going)  I mean who goes to a pizza place if they're on a diet anyway. seriously.  Anyway we usually get a pizza and a sallad or app. The lights are always dimming like someone is getting electricuted in the back room... it's annoying. but the staff is ok, and if they screw up your order or forget something they are good about comping you.\nAgain it's a good solid 6 on a 0-10 scale but the convienent location is the why we've gone back there maybe once every 1.5 mos.
