Went in around 10am on a Monday, checked in within 5 minutes, was told 170ppl in front us, left went to eat breakfast and run errands in the area, received text from DMV as to our status in line, drove back and was called approximately 15 minutes after arrival. Within 10 minutes paid for NDL, took picture and poof! We were done!...not so bad.
