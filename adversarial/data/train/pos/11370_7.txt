Ok, I thought I loved this place when Molly and I would frequent it for our al pastor taco fix. But, a few days ago my co worker introduced me to al pastor breakfast burrito for $5.50. I was in love... with the burrito, not the co worker. The staff is always friendly and accommodating, there is a full salsa bar and the prices are beyond reasonable. I will drive out of my way for the breakfast burrito, it is THAT good.
