My fiancé and I attended the open house here last night after having friends of ours who were married here recommend it. I also had the opportunity to chat with them at their booth at the wedding expo. It was fairly busy so we attempted to give ourselves a tour but didn't feel we were getting the flow down correctly so we asked one of the workers if we could have a tour. After a few minutes we were greeted by someone named Kim and that's  pretty much where the experience turned sour & never recovered. \n\nKim introduced herself and my fiancé introduced us, however after not getting either of our names correct after 2 attempts we just decided to be \"clay\" and \"Kerry.\" Before we could even get out the door (which was 10 feet away) Kim stepped away twice as someone in her ear piece must have been requesting info from her. This happened at least 10 times throughout our 10 minute tour. Every time a simple \"I'm sorry, just a second\" as we stood there awkwardly. She was not warm or inviting at any point during the tour, rather irritated & inconvenienced by our presence. It was tempting not to just walk out as I doubt she would have even noticed. Even hearing the way she spoke to people over her head set was concerning. \n\nIf this can't place even \"fake\" a positive attitude during a quick tour there is NO WAY we could place our faith with establishment on our big day. TreBella will not be our venue of choice for our wedding.
