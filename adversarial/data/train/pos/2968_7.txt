Good Service\n\nI've been a member of the Credit Union for a very long time. So far, it's been going very well. I have a checking, savings, and IRA account so I go to the credit union fairly often.\n\nThe staff are always helpful and friendly. The facilities are quite nice. Overall, I would recommend this credit union, over big banks. I feel like the people here really have my best interest in mind. I've never had any problems.
