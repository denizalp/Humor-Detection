My Order: Butternut Squash Agnolotti (Absolutely delicious, but it's one of their specials so you might not be able to get it in the future ;D) \n\nPros\n- Their food is usually top notch. We got the Seafood Pasta (which is rich of calamari, mussels, shrimp...) that I loved; and granted, that's a lot because I'm not a big seafood person\n- They have specials from time to time; I took a chance and got the butternut squash agnolotti which was very flavorful and yummy! \n\nCons\n- We didn't get our bread until AFTER we got our meal; that was annoying... especially since we were ravished\n- The waitress didn't swing by very often so we didn't get our water re-filled (not even once), it also took a while to order and get the bill\n\nTo be honest, I enjoyed their original location on Bovaird. The restaurant was smaller but the service was amazing. It might have to do with the fact that the new location is bigger (?) The other time I went, the party I came with was also bigger. Either way, I love their food. But their service leaves a lot more to be desired.
