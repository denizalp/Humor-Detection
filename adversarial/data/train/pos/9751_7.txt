Ya know, it's really tough to enjoy a meal when your experience with the hostess rubs you the wrong way right when you walk in the door.  We met some good friends there this past Thursday, and were there to use our groupon.  They have a two year old - which normally isn't even worth mentioning, but that's where it went horribly wrong with the hostess.  For some reason, she looked down on us - and not just because she's taller.  Basically she said they had a table in the back where we wouldn't bother anyone with the \"child\".\n\nI realize that restaurants such as these are normally quieter, more intimate, less rowdy, so it's not what she suggested, it's how she said it.  Our friend's child happens to be very well behaved, but she assumed we would be a distraction or a nuisance.  The fact that she was a ginger, while not affecting her poor courtesy, is still worth mentioning.\n\nThe server was attentive, for the most part, with the exception of drink refills.  I can't comment on the quality of the steak, because everyone I was with who ordered steak ordered it wrong (medium well \/ well done).  The food, for the most part, was forgettable, and unfortunately, we will not be back.  Luckily it was a cheap night thanks to groupon!!
