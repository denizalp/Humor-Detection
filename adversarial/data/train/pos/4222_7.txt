BEWARE! Screwed me out of about $5000 by selling me a BENT set of Asanti's. \n\nAfter over a YEAR of going back and forth, blaming me for having \"brake problems\" on my 5 year old Cadillac Escalade (wasn't the case) and refusing to allow me to return my rims, I'm FINALLY leaving this review.\n\nImmediately after purchasing these rims from SWAT, I noticed a terrible shaking of my steering wheel and my entire Escalade would shudder back and forth as I drove down the road. NOT SAFE!\n\nYet, no matter how many times I came back, how many videos I sent them with proof, SWAT blamed ME for bending the rims or made up other wild excuses to slither out of allowing a return.\n\nI never hit anything, and them trying to place blame on me for doing so is incorrect. I even let them have the rims back for \"repair\" on several occasions, only to be disappointed yet again every time that I came in to pick them up.\n\nNot only did I get screwed on the rims, they also put the absolute lowest grade tires on them as well, \"WinRun.\" Look the tire grade up, it's trash!\n\nAll in all, SWAT Motorsports is scammy, and treats their customers like trash. I'll never ever go back here and will make sure to let anybody considering doing so to go somewhere else.
