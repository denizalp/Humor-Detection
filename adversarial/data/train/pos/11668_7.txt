This guy in black was in charge of the terrible service they give in the Bell Trans shuttle services. When I bought the ticket they told me to wait 15 min for the next shuttle. After 20 min , I asked this guy and said wait another 20 min to half and hour.  When I asked why the told me 15 min...  He asked me to go back and complain with whoever sell me the ticket...  I cannot believe a place like Las Vegas has such a poor and uncoordinated service. Customer service is worse.  We were around 50 people waiting for 15 -20 people shuttles for about one hour....  Different people complain about shuttle waiting time, but he just asked them to complain to somebody else.  I asked why the person who sells the tickets are not coordinated with the guy who dispatches the shuttles and he just turn around.... Really?  In LA Vegas cannot be better ???
