We LOVE, love, LOVE, this place!!! \nIt's soo much fun to let the kids play while we get to sip wine, watch live music, and eat gourmet cheeses. \n\nWith free entry, so many food options, 3 levels of boutique shopping, and 2 different play areas, it's fun for all ages. \n\nOnce you get there, there is street parking and parking lot options. Once you're inside, there are clean bathrooms on both ends of the park.
