This is only a review for Huntersville.  I went 8\/14 and the menu still seemed to be about half of the Elizabeth location.  I asked for the classic saltado (the best item hands down) and the cashier even knew to say, \"Sorry, this location doesn't have steak.\"  What?  I suspect they hiding some of the sandwiches also.  I ended up with the arroz chaufa with chicken, which is just chicken fried rice with red onion added.  It's very good, and not salty at all like the chinese version always ends up.  I see another reviewer said the portion sizes are small.  They would only be small if you plan on putting 100 lbs very quickly because this dish is just a pile of food.\n  My wife got something with chicken, avocado, and lime soaked red onion.  I'd look up the name but I'm still mad about the steak thing.  Anyway, it was the better choice. \n  I was so excited that they were building a franchise up on the nice side of town.  The Elizabeth area is so shady.  Indeed, it was packed.  However, now I'm just left dreaming of classic saltado.
