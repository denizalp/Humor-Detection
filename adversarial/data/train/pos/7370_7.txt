Okay, I'm all for small independent businesses, so I'm glad to see this place open in downtown Mesa. It's next door to Mickey's Barbershop which I'm happy about, but sad at the same time because Mickey is retiring. After my chiropractor treatments, I went home and took the light rail to get vegan food at Volstead. Unfortunately, they were closed, but fortunately, Worth was worth checking out! They were open! There were only two items here that I could order, so I went with the grilled cheese sandwich. It wasn't your typical good old fashioned American cheese sandwich, but it was pretty good! The bread had fruit and nuts, and Havarti and white cheddar. Plus it came with a small container of blackberry for dipping! The combination of the grilled cheese and dipping sauce made my mouth happy.  This little eatery is probably not good for big crowds, but they do have enough tables and chairs to accommodate small groups. I'm not a potato chips person, but they do make their batch of homemade chips every morning. They also have seating areas in the front of the store. It's perfect if you are having a small gathering to order small sandwiches.\n\nNEAREST LIGHT RAIL STOP: Country Club & Main
