Creekside is a great local restaurant. My first visit was for a bday party. Creekside is a lot larger than it appears. It has a full bar and ample seating. When we walked in at 5 were were seated right away and greeted by our waitress. The are a lot of menu options to please everyone in your party. I chose the seafood pasta, which was to die for. Great experience and can't wait to visit again.
