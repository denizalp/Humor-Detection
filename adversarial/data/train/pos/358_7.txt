Wow.\n\nI had been waiting for a good time to get over and try out Seoul, and finally made the time with some friends on Saturday night. I repeat, wow. Nothing could have prepared me for the deliciousness that awaited. \n\nMy fiancee and I arrived around 7:45 to put our names on the list. We milled around the bar area and checked out the menu while waiting on the other two in our party. A couple of TVs in the dining room were playing college football games, and the two TVs at the bar were playing Korean (I presume) music videos with the audio coming thru the house speakers. The place was packed, which is obviously a good sign, and we were finally seated around 8:15.\n\nWhile still waiting on friends we placed an order for the pimento corn cheese. A healthy scoop of the pimento corn cheese is served with what I can only describe as a potato chip that has the texture of a cheese puff... or a cheese puff in the shape of a potato chip. Anyway, so good. The sweetness of the corn was a great complement to the pimento cheese.\n\nOnce everyone arrived, we essentially just ordered everything on the menu. I personally got the pulled pork which had great flavor and the lightly drizzled sauce added a nice zing to the dish. I would highly recommend the Ramen Mac 'n' Cheese, a creamy mac 'n' cheese dish with ramen noodles serving as the pasta. I also tried the crispy park belly (meh), sriracha cracklins (great flavor with the sriracha powder, but I've never cared for cracklins), and the sweet potato birds nest (essentially stringy fried sweet potato rolled up into the shape of a bird's nest).\n\nThe service was excellent, especially given how busy they were. Our waiter (Jude I believe his name was [Hey Jude {great song |I digress|}]) took great care of us even though it was our first time, we were indecisive, and had SO many questions. \n\nHitting up the beef ribs next time with a side of who the heck knows?!
