This place is a total scam. I first found this place by way of a groupon. I went at 8pm when all of their sushi rolls are half off with no restrictions unless of course you have a groupon. This clearly was not stated anywhere until of course I got my 40 dollar full price bill for sushi. They said they have a notice posted when you walk in stating the rule for groupons.  Clearly anyone walking in would not see it until the waitress pointed it out. It was a small little piece of paper in the corner of the window in small print. I sucked it up and just paid since I already paid for the groupon and the sushi was decent considering the area is lacking any kind of real sushi joint.\n\nThen I made the mistake of returning again for sushi a 2nd time. Again big sign stating half off all sushi, all day. I ordered three rolls all off the sushi menu with big bold letters stating half off ALL SUSHI ROLLS. When I got the bill the rolls were not half off as stated clearly on the menu. I asked the waitress what the deal was and she, \"oh we just changed it so its only 50% off certain rolls.\". I asked her how anyone would know that , and she just smiled and shrugged her shoulders. Good way to lose customers such as me.
