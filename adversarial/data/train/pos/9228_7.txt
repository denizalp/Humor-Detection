I'm in the members plus, so I get a more pampered experience.\nThere's a lounge, newspapers, TV, coffee\/tea, a private work out area and stretching area. There is also towel service and overnight locker service as part of your membership.\n\nThe showers, steam room, and sauna are all well maintained.\nThe whirlpool could really use a few cleanings\/year.\n\nStaff is generally very enthusiastic and approachable, with a few exceptions on the weekends. \n\nBeware Friday nights and weekends - lots of kids here, even in the Members+ area. These young teens, especially, can be very disrespectful (often swearing or bullying others) and like to break facility rules.\n\nI like to go at off-peak times. I appreciate that we can use the spin studio now, outside of class times. I swim and lift and feel there is adequate equipment and space to complete my work outs.
