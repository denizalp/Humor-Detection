I guess this is the white people version of Korean BBQ. The food tasted okay. I would say probably one of the better Korean BBQ places in Vegas, but that's like saying you're valedictorian of summer school or special ed because most of the Korean BBQ places here suck. The price was a little high. Like I said, this is the white people version so its good for them. Not for someone who came from Korea.
