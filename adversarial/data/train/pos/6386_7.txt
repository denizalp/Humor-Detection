I had checked in 07\/10\/16-07\/11\/16.  Parking signs were not visible to show where guests can park, but once you get in, it's easy to park.  I was amazed with all the interiors once inside.  Guest Check-In was approximately 30-40 mins, but the whole process itself was very quick.  Our host was very nice, hospitable, and answered all our questions making us excited about our stay.  He was a real plus!  Once inside ROOM #483, the bedroom and bathroom were beautiful!  I love it and everything was so comfortable!  Pool, restaurants, retail stores, and variety of casinos were all great.  \n\nNow, for the cons.  When I threw away my trash in the bin under the desk,  I noticed that there were 2 packages of cigarette packages with ashes inside.  This was supposed to be a non-smoking room and I was very disappointed.  Called housekeeping to change the whole trash can and not just dump it out because it stinked up the whole room.  When they finally arrived hours later, housekeeping asked if I had smoked.  WTH?  Didn't I just told you that I found all these things in my trash can and want a new bin b\/c this was a non-smoking room?  In addition, when I took a shower for the first time that evening, there were gobs of long strands of hair at the bottom of the shower floor.  I am VERY disappointed in housekeeping.  \n\nI really want to give Paris a 1 due to insufficient or lack of housekeeping, but b\/c I really do love the hotel and bedroom, I can't help, but give it a 4.  I hope that Paris Las Vegas improves on their housekeeping and the way they communicate to their guests.
