We ended up going to Chevrolet in Henderson and purchased a New High County after our experience with Wilson Toyota. Everything went great at the Chevrolet dealership and not one salesman threatened to \"BEAT MY ASS\" through the entire transaction! I didn't even get insulted once! Crazy, right?! Thanks David Wilson Toyota for pushing me into purchasing a new Chevy!
