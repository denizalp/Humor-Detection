I have gone to this club in the past and have enjoyed the experience.   I recently decided to revisit this club and had a bad experience .  I saw a dancer that caught my eye. I offered her a drink and a dance. After her canoodling me  I gave in and said i'll take  one ( 30 dollar)  dance.\n\nAfter some pleasant conversation over the drink( I treated her to),  the dance began .  After four minutes the song was over and I reached in my pocket to give her the 30 + 5 dollars for a tip, when she explained I actually owed her 60 dollars  because it was 2 songs.  By my count it was one dance. Apparently she decided to count the 5 minutes of  time we spent talking over the drinks i bought her as part of the dance as well.   I thought she was kidding and gave her the $ 35. This  beautiful little angel suddenly became a crazy little devil. She called her manager and made me out to be some kind of lunatic lowlife cheapskate.   I politely explained the situation to the  manager but he insisted i pay up which i promptly did .  After wards i made a quick exit.   \n\nThere was no mistaken that I was being blatantly scammed here.  I was in the club for less then 10 minutes and hadn't even finished my first beer, and was not drunk in the least.   Unless you don't mind being scammed by a dancer, and paying 60 dollars for a 4 minute dance I would  steer clear from this establishment .  A night I was hoping to relax over a beer and a beautiful dancer cost me 80 dollars for less then 10 minutes of harassment and aggravation.  It appears to be a pretty good club and i couldn't say if they regularly scam the patrons,  but  they sure as hell scammed me.  On principle I'll avoid this place  and I'll tell my friends to go elsewhere as well. The are  a ton of clubs in the area with gorgeous girls  that even have signs on the table that you will never pay for a dancer's time or for  her simply talking to you.\n\nYou've  been warned .\n\nJay
