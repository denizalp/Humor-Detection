Sorry Charlie :(\nUpdate: The new menu is a total rip. So many options have been removed including their well know steak and eggs for under $5 bucks! My sis and I ordered two omelettes with tomato, cheese, jalape√±o, spinach and two chocolates for $35. Absurd pricing at this local neighborhood casino. \n\nLate Night Snack\n\n\nArizona Charlies West is still holding its own as an off strip local casino with decent \"wallet friendly\" eats. Stopped in this evening to grab a well deserved snack (also known as a meal) and to sober my conveniently wasted gal pal! \n\nThe service has always been mediocre to be truthful but servers manage to get the job done. \n\nThe place is clean and not quite an ash tray like you would assume by the casino area. \n\nMy dinner Caesar salad was satisfying (drenched in dressing though) $7.99\nI ordered hash browns and toast as well which was also saturated in butter. \n\nMy gal pal had a shrimp dinner and ate plenty with no complaints. The shrimp looked nice and golden brown. $13.99\n\nIf your in the mood for cheap decent food this place is definitely recommended!\n\nOf course I'll be back!\n\n$30 bucks total
