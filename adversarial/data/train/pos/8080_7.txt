If you are going for an event at the conventions center, this is the hotel for you.\nIt is literally steps away from it.  No need to wakeup super early to avoid traffic, or transportation...   That extra sleeping time is appreciated.\n\nThe hotel lobby is pretty - love the purple sofas (my favorite color), and clean area.  \nAlso like that the bar is immediately accessible as you walk in but not \"in your face\", making the lobby very welcoming and not crowded.\n\nThe front desk people, concierge and everyone I encountered during my stay, were very helpful and respectful.   \n\nMy room was clean upon arrival and comfortable.  Loved that it also had a purple chair.\nBed was comfortable, stand in shower and tub, office desk, and TV.  \nIt includes 2 bottles of water per day, which I appreciated.  \n\nOnly complaint I would have about the room is the lighting.  Even when turning on all the lamps, it was still not bright enough to do my makeup and the bathroom light was not helpful either.  During the day is better since you get natural light from the window.\n\nAt first you might think there's no full-mirror but, open the cupboard closet and there you'll find it.  \n\nRoom service was fast, food was OK, and they include everything you might possible need like condiments, utensils and a glass of water with every meal you order.  \nFor dinner I had a cheeseburger with parmesan fries - I really enjoyed this one.  Flavorful, and even though I order it medium-well it was still juicy.\nBreakfast wasn't that great...  First thing I'm going to say is, stay away from the Lattes...  I do not know exactly what that was but, never again.  :\/\nThe omelet was good but the home potatoes tasted like they had been in the freezer a bit too long.\n\nThey have two restaurants on site, and a caf√© opened until 2pm.\nAnd, for the nights you want to go out, Firefly is just two minutes away, and so is its sister restaurant Tacos & Beer.\nThe Strip is just 10 minutes away, so even though your off it, you get to enjoy Vegas the right way, without spending the extra money of the big hotels.\n\nGreat option for business\/ quick trips, or if you want to save a little money on a fun one.
