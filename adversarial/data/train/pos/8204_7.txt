Waiting for the folks again, I decided to try Bravo again for the third time.  As I walked in at around 1:30pm today, 11.10.16, the hostess never greeted me just turned her head like she was having a bad day.  I thought about turning around, but instead headed to a friendlier bar.  \n\nYul, name on the receipt, was my bartender.  Quick & super nice as I got an very important phone call so was pretty much on the phone from then on & still placed my order w\/o interruptions.  The bar area was empty once again.  I usually wouldn't be on the phone like this either, but had Yul pick my 'pick two' salad & pasta entree.  He picked the chopped salad, which I always get at Brio.. it was good.  I picked through it, but not crisp lettuce at all.  Not like Brio.  And the linguine carbonara, which I love peas so that was good too, a little on the soupy sauce side.  Good is not great.  \n\nService was great this time & he seemed like he enjoyed being there too, not like I've witnessed before w\/ their employees.  Will give them an extra star for service.  And one for the tasty olive oil w\/ pepperoni & focaccia bread that I could've just eaten as an entree.
