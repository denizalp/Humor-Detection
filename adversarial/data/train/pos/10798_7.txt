Given the great reviews I had high expectations for Mr. Mama's.  They were not met.  It is clean and the staff is friendly but there is nothing exceptional about the breakfast other than the long wait to be seated.  The hash browns, omelette, and French toast were average and no where near as good as other reviewers described them.  I was surprised that they did not put out real butter.  If you want it be sure to ask.  \n\nThe prices are reasonable and the food is not bad but I think that Mr. Mama's is living off the momentum of earlier popularity.
