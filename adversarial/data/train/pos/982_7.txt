Secret Pizza definitely hits the right spot... especially if you are drunk\/tipsy\/buzzed from a night at Marquee.  I would leave clubbing early to beat the 2am long line, but I'm a fatty.  Even if you want to just fall asleep and go home, this pizza is worth the extra 30 min out.  Just go upstairs to the third floor and find the tiny little alley with drunk people leaning on the wall in line.  The white pizza is amazeballs and always ask for it even if you don't see it.  Sometimes they have a pizza waiting under the table!  Shhhh!  Secret pizza...
