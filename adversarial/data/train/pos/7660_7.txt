I would not recommend this place. They dented my front door, somehow got grease on my wall, dirty up some of my walls, didn't cover anything so I've been cleaning the entire house since they \"did\" the job. I had a hanger where the wire was twisted into my name until they damaged that. To top it all off, the person they did bring in to clean only put my dishes in the dishwasher including a knife set that does NOT go into the dishwasher. I knew I should of walked out the second they lied to me. I told them I was looking for textured laminate and they told me that doesn't exist. That's funny because my sister had that installed in her house a month earlier but my husband is a sucker for anyone who smiles at him. All I can say is this was a huge waste of my time and money.
