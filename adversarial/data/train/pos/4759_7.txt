Parking: Free - small lot\n\nWashrooms: OK\n\nExperience\/Venue: Small venue.\n\nFood: As someone who does not eat any meat my options were severely limited to french fries. I was here mostly to hang out with friends. So the 2-star rating says \"Meh. I've experienced better.\" It fits my experience perfectly because I've probably have experienced better, nothing against the actual food and staff personally. I also need to start throwing around 2-stars to balance out my reviews and this is my first 2-star rating.
