Taro snow boba, fairly solid. Boba was a bit overcooked but flavor of the taro was prominent instead of watered-down, as it has been elsewhere. Drink sizes, medium and large, are generous and pricing is about average: medium is just under $5.\n\nStore itself has plenty of retro seating and offers a food menu of sandwiches and various fried snacks as well as drinks- iced coffee drinks and free wifi included.\n\nSignage posted for a free size upgrade when posting a review on Yelp- not sure if this is really kosher, should probably be a check-in deal instead of soliciting reviews but whatever. Would come back when in the area, but I'm usually not in this neck of the woods.\n\nSide note: walked up to the counter and a previous customer's wallet and sunglasses were left there. Found it odd that the cashier didn't seem to notice, but it was returned to it's owner who was seated nearby.
