Five stars for the bar. Zero for the bartenders. I get it... you're busy, but there is no need to be exceptionally rude to a paying customer just because you don't have something I wanted to order. Not a big deal, I will order another item.\n\nMe: are you able to make a hot toddy? I'm really sick but I'd like a drink.\n\nAppropriate answer: no, we don't have the ingredients. Can I make you something else?\n\nWhat actually happened: I don't even know what that is, we are a tiki bar... and walked away.\n\nLast tiki bar we were at, we dropped over $200 on drinks, dinner and tiki. \n\nThis place won't be seeing a dime. Unless you are some local they know by name, I doubt they will be nice to you. Drive the extra 20 minutes to Porco. Ask for Tommy.
