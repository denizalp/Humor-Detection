Great little place, recommended to me by Tonia M. Bartz.\n\nI went in today, and found a great pan (don't underestimate a great pan), and an ice cream maker, with two freezer bowls.\n\nThe thing is, I bought this same ice cream maker at a garage sale, not realizing it was missing the freezer bowl.\n\nNow I have two complete ice cream makers to feed my inner fat kid!!\n\nGood prices, too!
