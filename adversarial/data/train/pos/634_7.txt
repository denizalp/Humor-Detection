A good spot for a low key night of getting your groove on. Yes, you may encounter a motley crew of tourists from the Hawaiian shirted to the badged convention goer, but the cover is cheap and the music is pretty straight forward. What you won't find is a gaggle of mini-dresses and Affliction button ups. You also won't find an overly complicated dance mix here, and it is quite easy to jaunt up the stairs and ask the DJ to play \"Nasty Girl\". I know because that is what I did. The dance floor is not huge, and it is pretty easy to get a table without  bottle service if you arrive at a decent hour. If the patio is open, it provides a fun view of the bedazzling spectacle of Fremont Street. I would return for a second round.
