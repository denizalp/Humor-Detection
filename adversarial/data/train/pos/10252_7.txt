When was the last time your table was bused between courses in any restaurant?  I mean -- wiped down, new utensils, napkins, etcetera?\n\nWe came here last week, after going to Cine' Capri. We searched Yelp for a nearby restaurant, to try something different and came across Cafepino.  It didn't register to us at all and we thought we knew the area. \n\nAs we were leaving, we noticed it on the left. Could it be Cafepino?  Because of the dark tinted windows and trees, we've always walked past it and never thought to go in. Stupid, because 'Pino is a special kind of place.\n\nThe family that owns and runs 'Pino is from France. In fact, the original restaurant was started in Paris in 1958 and is still going strong. As I mentioned, it was the busing of tables that started a conversation with one of the owners. As we came in and looked at the posted menu, he encouraged us to stay in a Gallic sort of way, and we're glad we did!\n\nWe ordered their 'Pino Garden Salad ($9.00) that came with a flavorful light balsamic vinaigrette that was just right.  When we ordered, we told them we were going to share and without instruction, two plates were brought along with the salad. I know this might appear minor, but it gives you an idea of their professionalism. The wait staff is a ever watchful tag team effort. Very French!\n\nAs we were finished, two employees cleaned our table and our pizza arrived.  The Margherita ($14.00), was very good.  We ordered it half garlic for a $2.00 up-charge. Next time, we'll try the 'Pino's pizza with black olives. That's what the table next to us had and it looked good!\n\nWhen the bill came, we thought we were getting away with something special, since it was only $25.00, before taxes and tip.  I've noticed on the bottom of the check, it says: \"CAFEPINO, it's something else!\"  We would agree.  \n\nIt also teaches you to search Yelp, even when you know an area for new places. If we didn't, we would of turned right to our car, and not left. In the process, we would have missed a great little restaurant.  We'll be back. \n\nEnjoy!
