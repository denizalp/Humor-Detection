I can't express how pleased I am with their services! I moved to Las Vegas late last year, 2014. Just a month ago I got into an auto accident and sought treatment for my back and shoulder pain. I was able to locate the wellness center on my health insurance providers' list and took a chance. Came in and was immediately taken care of. The receptionist (Cheree) was most helpful to me from the beginning. Dr. Colucci is absolutely fantastic. She's extremely kind and keeps you informed each visit. The massage therapist on staff is amazing with her trigger point sessions! I highly recommend this place, no doubt.
