How did this little gem slip under my radar?!??!\n\nThey've been open for about five months now, and I was hugely impressed!!! The restaurant itself is BEAUTIFUL inside, with a lovely grand piano and very subtle decorations. I mean... this place is CLASSY, and not what I would have expected!\n\nAnyways... on to the food! We sat, and took a look at our menus... and every item has a picture! That's great for people who might not be overly familiar with a different cuisine, and it's nice to be able to take a look at something before ordering it. So we ordered our food, and this is the only reason why I can't give this place a five-star rating:\n\n-----\n\n\"We'll try the Dan Dan noodles, the tripe in chili oil, the frog legs hotpot, and the pork with dried mushroom hotpot please.\"\n\n\"Whaaaa?!?!? That's SO spicy! You want that?!?! That's so spicy for you!\"\n\n\"No, it's okay. We like spicy food.\"\n\n*skeptical eye narrow*\n\nThen when receiving our food...\n\n\"May we have some chopsticks please?\"\n\n\"WHAAAA?!?!?! YOU USE CHOPSTICKS??!??!\"\n\n*sigh*\n\n-----\n\nSeriously folks, it's 2016. White people (and Mexicans too!) know how to use chopsticks, and some things are just much easier to eat with chopsticks than with a fork. So please, quit it with the incredulity. And yes, we eat things other than General Tso's chicken and Pork Fried Rice. So again, cut it out with the \"are you sure you eat that\" just because I'm white. Anyways...\n\nThe food was ON POINT. If I come here a few more times and the food is this good again then I'll give them five stars even with the annoyingly patronizing concern for my palate. The Dan Dan noodles were delicious, really nice ground pork on top with sauteed spinach. The tripe was faaaaanTAStic, swimming in that nice Sichuan peppercorn chili oil that leaves a tingle on your tongue. The hotpots were also amazing, and the frog was especially noteworthy. Be careful, because there *ARE* bones in it, but if you're coming to an authentic Chinese restaurant then you need to be ready for bones. \n\nThe prices are all extremely reasonable, the portion sizes are reasonable, everything here is great!!! Once I get over my annoyance at being pigeonholed I'm sure I'll end up giving this place five stars, but in the meantime I'm going to hold off.
