I really do wanna give this place a good review because I used to come here a lot back in high school. But after trying many other AYCE restaurants Sushi Legend really is subpar in comparison.\n\nFirst of all the price isn't even cheap, weekend lunch is $17, which is $2 more expensive than other AYCE sushi joints. After we handed in the ordering paper we waited 15mins to get the basic soup and seaweed salad, and that was after I complained to the server. \n\nThe food was really disappointing. The ingredients weren't fresh: soggy fish and bland overly frozen shimp in the tempura shimp. The presentation was horrible too, they basically just put the food on the plate and just serve that to you. I usually like to take lots of pictures when I go out to eat and this time I put my camera phone down because the food was just underwhelming. The chicken wings did surprised me though...just look at the size!! That chicken must have been just 1 month old.\n\nDessert couldn't save this restaurant either. The tiramisu was just a tiny cake plus a bunch of whipped cream. The was another dessert that was literally just whipped cream. The herbal jelly and mango yogurt were the only good desserts.\n\nIn conclusion, this place is overpriced, food with terrible ingredients, and bland presentation. Would not come back again.
