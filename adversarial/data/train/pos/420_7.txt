I call this Old Vegas meets New Recession.  An old Vegas showgirl with way too much makeup but not enough to hide the age.  What a disappointment.  Repairs like carpet stains, missing moldings, plumbing issues, etc. not being attended to due to budget cutbacks.  My buddies and I showed up to see the Final Four but the race & sports book was closed down just 2 days before the weekend???  What a crock.  If I want a cheap hotel on the strip I would have......wait a minute...this was a cheap hotel on the strip.  I just did not want it to look and act so cheap.  In a down economy, they should worry about making those who DO show up, feel special, not make them feel like don't matter.
