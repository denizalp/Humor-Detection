I come here once in a while. This place is a step up from Applebees but still lands on my mediocre list. \n\nThe menu is all over the place, I never know what to order. But, they do usually have deals such as 25$ for two. So you order 2 entrees that comes with an appetizer for 25$. Today that was not on the menu anymore. They did have a dinner one for $35 but I didn't really pay much mind to it. \n\nI've had few different items on their menu. One that I usually get is the Texas fries. It's basically loaded fries (cheese, jalape√±os, and bacon). I have had their flat beard before which are pretty good. The beau usually gets their ribs which really aren't anything special. \n\nThey added these screens at each table. You can order your dessert, ask for a refill, look at the menu, play games (for 99cents each game), and pay your bill on. It's pretty neat because it even allows you to split the check and tells you how much to tip! \n\nFound out that all day Sunday is Happy Hour but only at the bar and we had already sat ourselves in the dinning area and ordered our foods. darn! They had some good discounts of food and drinks too! \n\nService is usually on the slower side. Today it was pretty fast surprisingly.
