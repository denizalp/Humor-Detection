Key facts to remember about a champagne buffet\n\n1. Come starving. You're here to indulge your gluttony or fuel up for a night of drinking...not to indulge in a light snack. \n2. Get on the expensive stuff.  Gotta get your moneys worth. That means the Crab legs friends. Its good here. Trust me\n3.  Ignore the creamy stuff. You can only put down so much, the creamy stuff will prevent you from getting those last 3 plates. \n4. When your friend starts slurring her words after two champagne glasses, time to start drinking those glasses for her. \n4. There's no shame in going back for 5th, 6th and 7th rounds.  It costs $40. Eat what you came for. Play your cards right and you won't have to eat for the rest of the day.\n5. Expecting great sushi at a buffet is just silly. This place is no exception. \n6. Same goes for pizza. This isn't a dorm cafeteria...if you want pizza, go to a place that specializes in pizza\n7. There are a billion choices, why stick with just one? Try something new. Don't overindulge in one thing...\n8. ...unless its the delicious lamb or prime rib. Lose yourself.\n9. When your friend starts drunkenly ranting at you, time to get up and go explore the buffet some more. \n10. Its a marathon..not a sprint. Take some time and enjoy the very pretty surroundings. \n11. There's ALWAYS room for dessert....especially when its as good as it is here.\n12. When your friend passes out  on the table, thats a signal to get out of there.\n\nDefinitely plan on hitting this place up again! May go with different people though....
