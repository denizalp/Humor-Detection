Damn! I wanted to be the first to write about this funky fresh new dining spot. My review is completely on the other end of the spectrum of the last reviewer. I've been to Hillside Spot about half a dozen or more times and have been entertained, well fed, and treated like family. \n\nHillside has big chestnuts to open a place like this in a town that is used to ITALIAN ITALIAN and more ITALIAN restaurants. The only thing you might find Italian at Hillside is one of the chef's slicked back jet black hair style. I'm not even sure if that's Italian but it looks cool. \n\nThe best seat in the house is the mesquite locally made bar. It's has some serious wood. It's placed right in front of the open kitchen. You see everything from the chefs working their flavor magic to their bad ass rotisserie - it's awesome. \n\nDo you want to know about the food? It's good! Their Modern American cuisine has a little flare (nothing that will scare off the Italian junkies), a lot of flavor, and fair prices. The ingredients are fresh and locally purchased. \n\nHats off to Hillside's staff, especially Christopher and I think she is the FOH manager (she has black hair and always smiling.) They have passion; they are courteous; and genuine. Clap clap clap!  \n\nHillside if you read this - will you consider adding something special to your menu? A handmade seasonal milkshake. Mmmmmmmm. And wifi, please!
