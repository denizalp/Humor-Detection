The oysters were okay. Not bad. But is it weird to complain about their shape? I'm no oyster connoisseur but I've had my fair share. These had some odd shapes. Shapes that were a bit hard to eat. Like mutated large ones that were hard to take down. This sounds weird...\n\nAm I being an oyster snob? Maybe. Probably. And they were kinda small. Were they good? Yeah... but they weren't the best I've had either. \n\nIf you're looking for the bar, it's gonna be in the middle of the casino to the left as you walk in from the Strip. Nice thing is you can take a break from \"all that money you're winning\" to down some oysters. That I'm okay with!
