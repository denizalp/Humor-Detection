Sorry, Shenanigans.\nYou're a classic example of unrealised potential.\nA lady on a pole can really screw up a brutha's judgement.\n\nSuch supercools digs, and yet apparent satisfaction with such a generic standard.  The sportsbar goings on in this establishment are not worthy of the amazing architecture.\n\nThis new disillusionment is based on my recent attempt to actually use the bar for its main purpose, to drink alcohol.  \n\nAfter a sad, quick glance at the beer tap pulls, the pyramid of empties on the back of the bar make it seem like there's a large selection of bottled, at least.\n\nBut no, my hoppy friends, that is not the case.  I think the most imaginative thing there was Sam Adams Boston Lager.  They had Blue Moon, but I'm not a fan.  Think of every single other generic american beer and its Lite version, and it's there.  Why?!  Why have 6 or 7 different brands of american fermented rice lager, when the current trends in pub style have everyone and their mother drinking microbrew ales, stouts, and hefes? \n\n*also* - i understand cost and spillage, etc and how important that kind of thing can be to the owner's bottom line (esp employee theft), but I have never in my life seen a bar install special caps on all the bottles of liquor and an electronic device that fits over the bottle and measures an exact pour.  \nI get it.  \nbut it's stupid.\n...and... if as the bartender, you're going to make a comment that it's not your fault the owner makes you use such a thing, at least learn how to use the damn thing !!! If i'm only getting that one ounce then you'd better be sure squirting the liquor down onto your overfill of ice cubes doesn't splash my Captain all over the side instead of into the glass!!!  .and then you'd better not splash the soda in so full to the top that it spills over the side.  That's my ounce! I paid for it, and apparently I'm not getting anymore!!\n\nif you like generic beer and don't get mixed drinks, then this place can still be pretty cool.\nif i win a lotto, i'm buying the damn building and tying the owner to a wall for a month so s\/he can see how a bar with this much potential _should_ be run.
