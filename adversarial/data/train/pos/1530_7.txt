We came here for my friend's birthday dinner on a Friday night, and to be fairly honest, we came upon this place only because the wait at Mon Ami Gabi was ridiculous and we were starving.  Turns out it was for the best, because this is a hidden gem at the Venetian!  It doesn't look like much from the outside, but the inside is so cute!  The staff couldn't be nicer or more attentive.  Our water glasses were always full, and freshly baked bread was served one roll at a time (perfect for someone who lacks self-control around carbs like yours truly).  The Onion Soup Gratinee w\/ the gruyere cheese  was the best french onion soup I've ever had.  Rather heavy, though, and the meal would have been perfect even if I had just stopped there.  But how could a girl  not gorge herself crazy at a place like this?  For my entree, I had the Mussel Mariniere (which is an appetizer, but works just as well as a entree).  Yummy dish, but I could have used more white wine broth.  It came with garlic fries, which was basically evil disguised in an innocent-looking cone.  Luckily, the nice server took them away before I ate too many of them.  Again, I can't emphasize how nice the staff is here.  Our waiter literally spent 15 minutes discussing all the desserts with us, and when we eventually decided on the Chocolate Souffle, it was on the house!  Will definitely return to this place when I visit Vegas again, but had to knock off one star for the lack of white wine broth with my mussels.
