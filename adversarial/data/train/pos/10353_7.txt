I'm very torn about Bagel Factory, as living in New York made me a bagel snob.  It's not fair to compare Bagel Factory to a NYC bagel so I won't.  But if that is what you are craving, this will not fill that void.  I think the best bagel in Pittsburgh is a fair claim to fame, but Pittsburgh has some really bad bagels.  Just a thought.\n\nI ordered a rye bagel with bacon, egg, and cheese ($3.99).  There was a ton of good, thick bacon on the sandwich, and that was AMAZING.  Plenty of cheese and the perfect amount of egg as well.  But the bagel was pretty much flavorless.  Rye bagels should have flavor.  If this place wasn't called the bagel factory, it would be different.  But the bagel was so whatever.  The bagels are also really small for a fresh bagel.\n\nI would definitely come back to the Bagel Factory, but I think they really should work on creating a more memorable bagel.\n\nThey accept credit cards.
