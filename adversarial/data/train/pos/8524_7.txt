When is the awards ceremony for worst Moscow mule ever? Not only the worst, but consistently the worst across various bartenders.\n\nLet's backtrack. Walking in here, it is a shocking place that can only be described as a time machine into the year 2005, when wearing affliction shirts was still cool and looking like a cast member of jersey shore was the only aspiration that one could have in life. This area is called the \"duche loop\" for a reason and Bottled Blonde embodies that spirit. \n\nThe music is of course pretentiously loud, each individual in the crowd thinks they are way too cool for the place, drinks are expensive and taste like gasoline diluted with lime juice. Back to the Moscow Mule, it's hard to imagine how proportions can be messed up every time here, thus don't even bother asking for a good vodka. It will all be the same, drowned in the soullessness of this establishment. If visiting for the purposes of seeing this ridiculous scene, keep the visit short, grab a beer and get rolling.
