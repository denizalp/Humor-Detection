This really our second time to be in this airport, but the first time coming out of it.  The first time was a stop over heading to New Mexico, well the airport is huge.  I underestimated the distance between the gate we got off and where the baggage claim was.  It was pretty confusing, and when we got to the baggage claim area, the monitor kept changing what carousel our luggage will come off.  It was pretty frustrating to keep jumping from one to another.  Looking for your flight on the monitor and having it disappear then reappear on the next carousel.  \n\nAfter all that we went out to the shuttle bus for the rental cars and having to look at a long line just for the shuttles stops.  Didn't know that there was an accident that delayed the routine routes of the buses but it was long and it took almost an hour from the time we were waiting and getting to our destination which is the car rental place.  It was pretty much quite a distance from the airport itself with the traffic.  Maybe it's not usually like that but I'm rating this based on our experience.  Not so good
