Look at you California visitors in love with this bar. Haha\n\nBut who couldn't love this place?! Do try all the drinks on their menu, BUT do not get beer or your usual vodka tonic. \n\nThe bartenders are pretty knowledgeable of the drinks. I usually order drinks that no one has made since bartending school such as a Sazerac, Manhattan or an Old Fashioned.\n\nIt does get pricey but in a good way. You're better off getting your drinks at a bar and taking them to the couches. The servers are kinda slow... and half naked.\n\nDO: Dress classy \nDON'T: hang on the beads\/crystals, it won't support any weight.
