My boyfriend is obsessed with this place so he had to bring me to try it. Pizza Pide is a small neighborhood store serving pizza and Turkish pide (as the name suggests).\n\nWe ordered the Assorted Pide (comes in 4-5 flavours) and the Lahmacun. As they make it fresh upon order, expect the wait for your food to be ~15-20 min. Presentation was on point though - our pide was brought out along with a heap of herbs, onions, tomatoes and pickled peppers.\n\nOverall, I enjoyed the food, but I can't say I've been converted to a die-hard Pizza Pide fan. My favourite flavour was the Roasted Lamb, followed by the Lahmacun. I found that accompanying your side with the sauces and vegetables provided adds that additional layer of complexity in flavour, so I would highly recommend.
