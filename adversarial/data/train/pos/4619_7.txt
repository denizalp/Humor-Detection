I seem to have have adopted SLEM as fuel\/sundries stop of choice.  My one beef is the parking lot, it can get tight during the busy times but as luck would have it I have not been tagged (myself or my vehicle) yet.  All in all, prices are comparable to everywhere else but it is the employees that keep me coming back.  Those working behind the counter work quick to get you in and out but without any attitude.  I really appreciate the customer service.
