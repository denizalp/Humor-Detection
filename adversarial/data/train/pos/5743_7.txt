In Vegas, the Superpawn shops are pretty clean and full of good stuff....so, I expected the same out of this Scottsdale location.  Boy, was I wrong!  This place was terrible!  They didn't have any quality items for sale.  All of their stuff was junk.\n\nBesides the lack of product, the service here was terrible as well.  All of the employees were busy working the pawn windows, so I had to wait 20 minutes to have someone open up a jewelry case to look at some watches.  During that time, I felt rushed and the employee told me that if I was just going to browse she'd have to come back to me later because she was busy and would have to help the other customers who were waiting to pawn stuff.....seriously?!  How are they supposed to make money when you're not selling?!\n\nThis experience would never have happened at their Vegas stores.  They take care of their customers out there and have a balance between employees helping pawn customers and buying customers.\n\nReturn Factor - 1%
