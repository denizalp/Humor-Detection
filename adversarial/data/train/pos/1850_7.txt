I have a hard time giving this even two stars as the first impression they made on me was pretty poor.\n\nMy boyfriend has been wanting a Sam's Club membership, even though we have another wholesale membership elsewhere that I prefer. He insists that the junk food\/frozen food selection is far superior here at Sam's, and seeing as how he is the only purchaser of such items in the house, I had to take his word for it. So after months of griping about the lack of selection at my choice of store, I break down and buy him a membership here.\n\nThe reason for the two stars is the service we received when going in to buy a membership. Seems like it should be a pretty fast or at least a welcoming experience. Nope. Waited about 8 minutes for the man in front of us to be done, since he had all three clerks helping him over some confusion. After that bit was settled, the clerks chatted amongst themselves for a moment before inviting us the register. Process was fairly standard, except the lady who was setting us up moved us to four different computers during the enrollment. She also got exasperated when I told her it would be in my boyfriend's name even though I was the purchaser. Not sure why that was any trouble?\n\nThe man next to me wasn't having a much better time just trying to renew his membership. He didn't have his card, so she needed to know if he needed a new one or a temporary one. He just wanted to renew his membership. This back and forth went on for a while until he just got frustrated and told her to do whatever it was she needed to do to make it work so he could get his membership. It was a rough day for all of us, apparently.\n\nAfter the grumpy service we left without doing any shopping, but the boyfriend was happy with the ridiculous picture he'd taken for his membership card. Expect Walmart service, since this is owned by the same company. I added an extra star for the \"great\" frozen food selection of major brands.. service leaves a lot to be desired.
