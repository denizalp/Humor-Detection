I must say that Hubert Keller can definitely make some stellar burgers. \n\nThe Burger Bar is LOCATED in the Mandalay Palace (Between The Mandalay Bay and Luxor walkway) is one of my favorite places to get a burger in LV. One, I love the \n\nQUALITY OF MEAT. They have great choices to choose from such as Angus, Lamb, Buffalo and my favorite Kobe. Not only is the meat good, they also have great buns. I think they work out a lot. PRICES here are very reasonable and in my opinion, excellent for the quality of food. If you a balla or if you just won a few bucks gambling then I would recommend you try the ROSSINI. It's a 60 dollar burger that is made with Wagyu Beef and foie gras.  I can tell you that it's worth it (If your a burger lover and like foie gras that is) Similar to other burger joints, the Burger Bar offers specialty burgers or you can customize your own. My recommendation would be to do both if your with someone else or if your really hungry. \n\nThe ENVIRONMENT here looks like  your average bar and grill. Dim lighting and lots of TV's.  They even have TV's in every booth. This place has always been crowded and there was always a wait list whenever I ate here. I have said this in many of my other reviews but if you don't like to wait then go and eat early to beat the crowd. \n\nThe SERVICE has been good on both visits. They took care of us well which was pretty impressive considering how busy they get.\n\nOverall, I can always count on this place to satisfy my burger needs whenever I am in LV.  I give this place 5 stars because I believe that the quality of food for the PRICE to go along with their SERVICE is worth it.
