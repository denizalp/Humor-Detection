Me and my boyfriend went here to try out something new for dinner. After reading the Yelp reviews, I had to try the fish n chips for myself, because I am PICKY! PICKY! PICKY! when it comes to fish n chips. My b\/f ordered the Texas Burger. So our order arrives and the food was piping hot (very good), HOWEVER.....the quality wasn't there. My fish n chips were so-so, they look like deep fried blocks\/cubes of fish. It was dry and the tartar sauce was too mayonaiss-ie. The Texas burger was oddly shaped, (rectangular) and served on a sub style bread. The burger wasn't the best and the flavor was bland. I guess this place has a thing for square-ish looking food? Anyway, I've certainly had WAY better fish n chips in Rio Rancho, NM at Turtle Mountain Brewing Company :D \nAs far as decor....it just plain sucks! very, very, very drab and outdated. It's bad enough dealing with flourescent lightning at work, but in a restaurant?? wtf! Everyone looked sallow and yellow. \nI would've gave it 1 star but I added the extra star because the check was easy on the wallet and I liked the iced tea lol :)
