Sunday brunch kind of place. Headed down with some friends to grab brunch and booze. My favorite part of brunch is booze. We walk in and they were busy almost every table was full. We put our names down and waited for the rest of the party to arrive. While waiting decided to check out the bathroom. I was told there was glorious soup there. It was a salt\/sugar\/honey scrub. It smelled great and they also had room keys on the wall. Thought that was cool. We got seated and had Nick as our waiter. He was the best part. He kept our glasses full and kept us entertained while we waited for our food. I just ended up order a bowl of fruit and the endless mimosas. I don't think my glass was ever empty and I liked that. My friends order some pizza and random sausage that was apparently it was delicious but they did not share. RUDE. Overall it was a pretty average expierence. I think I should go back and order some different options. Also be aware, some people can not handle all you can drink mimosas.
