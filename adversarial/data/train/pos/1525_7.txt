Another one of those surprises from my husband. Got a call late. Get ready we are going out. Where? just be ready when I get home he said, some of you  ladies know what I am talking about and guys you know what we mean. I thought ok! he is not proposing again but a new ring will be nice lol...this one is already 14 years old  but I am still loving it, let say it still fits. Ok! for this one I had to put on my best piece. Off we go and it is getting late Calgary is cold most places are closed. Here we are Montanas last call for dinner order. I have to say I was very impressed with the service. At the end of the day like this everyone want to go home, but the waitress was patient and nice. I would recommend...There are different location but this was Sarcee Trail location. I would go back there again.
