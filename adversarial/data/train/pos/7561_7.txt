A little hard to review this place since we came around 5pm on a Sunday (not exactly prime hours)....and were killing time before our red eye flight.\n\nTHE GOOD\n**Happy hour til 6pm our drinks were very cheap.\n**Beautiful place and great setup, and we were able to sit right by the stage.\n**Some beautiful girls.\n\nTHE BAD\n**Of course these hours meant we weren't going to see a ton of girls, I think we were told only 9 were currently working.  \n**Some not so beautiful girls. \n**Charged me to get in.... which was annoying because I'm used to females getting in for free when they are with a male.  \n\nTHE IN BETWEEN\n**Definitely felt as though the girls took advantage of my friends drunkeness and probably got more $$ than they should.  Of course this is to be expected and is their job, but it felt a little bit over the line. \n\nI think this is the 3rd or 4th strip club I've been too, and overall would definitely recommend.  I would love to check it out during prime hours, but also worried I'd be forced to get bottle service or something else not wanted.
