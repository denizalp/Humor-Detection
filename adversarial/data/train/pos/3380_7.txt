I just realized that I have not reviewed PublicUs.  PublicUs comes to mind when I think of Downtown Las Vegas.  It's one of my favorite places to go to for their coffee, food, and to hang out.  If I'm here for breakfast, I'll stick to just their eggs, bacon, and omelets. There's a lot on their menu and everything is either organic or healthier.  During dinner, PublicUs has a lot of great options as well including a tasty chicken, awesome flank steak, and a delicious braised short rib. I know that I didn't mention desserts and pastries.  The got a lot of that stuff here.  Check them out for yourself.  You really can't go wrong with any of the food at PublicUs.\n\nWhen I think of PublicUs, I think of the incredible service and ambiance.  You'll find locals, tourist, families, hipsters, and people here on dates.  The seating is limited only because it's busy and a very popular spot in Downtown LV.  Overall, I'm more than just a fan.  I look forward to every visit at PublicUs. \n\nTIP:  Dinosaurs everywhere!
