UPDATED. \n\nI'm a regular here. Like I'm here at least 1-2 times a week.The servers should know that by now. \n\nToday I came in with my sister and bf who both got #1 the bbq short ribs. Hers came out OK. and his was burnt to the bone . \n\nWe tried sending it back to remake and the server said the kitchen didn't let, and so on. We told them we didn't want it because eating burnt is bad for you . So we told her to just remove it off the bill. (4 mins after its brought to the table) she came back and said the kitchen said NO and that we ate HALF of it so we pay for whatever we ate. There's no way we would eat half of your burnt short ribs in 4 mins or at all. \n\nSo then the cook came out and started raising his voice to my bf who insisted we either get a refund or have it  remade. the first time asking they refused to remake it (probably because they usually use the same food If it's ever sent back but in this case ribs can't be remade once it's burnt.) then they agreed to remake it after yelling and shit, and who would want a cook like that to make the food? Probably will spit in it \n\nhe said some crap about calling the police when he's the one that is basically saying the customer is wrong and forcing us to eat the very burnt ribs. \n\nLike go ahead you goof. You'd make a fool out of your own business. \n\nThere is little to no ventilation in the kitchen so the smoke is always burning your eyes so there's no improvement from the first time I been there \n\nSo yeah, my 3 star was just being generous from before. But bad service goes a long way for me, and if you think the customers wrong then you sure are a clever one just for that $11 when clearly we weren't wrong or weren't been rude about it at all. Don't raise your voice so the whole few seats can hear you \n\ncall the cops next time idiot- if there is a next time.
