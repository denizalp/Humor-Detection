Just recently moved back from Japan & so grateful for this restaurant! Tastes just like home. Clean, relaxing atmosphere. You can go with your family, or with a date, or with a group if friends. Friendly staff. Can't go wrong here. \n\nLast time I went I had their carbonara udon. Was a bit skeptical at first but it was delicious!
