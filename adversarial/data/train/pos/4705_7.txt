This place blows. The service is slow and grumpy. The pizza is thin and chewy and WAY OVERPRICED.\n\nThe rest of the menu is small portions and, again, WAY OVERPRICED.\n\nNothing special tasting about anything served here either. Most of it tastes like Stouffers Frozen Food.\n\nMy Italian Gramma wouldve hit these guys in the head with a meatball. If any real Italian restaurants opened in the area, this place would sink like a brick. Just like the brick they put in my stomach.
