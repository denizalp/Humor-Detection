Piola marks my official first\/second Yelp event with fellow yelpers, and when I say fellow yelpers I mean Elites...everyone was an Elite...EXCEPT FOR Meeeeeeee~!\n\nSo I showed up to Vivek's 'Community Manager No More' party at Church something Bar, I showed up sometime after 8pm thinking I've arrived early, in fact I was late.  As soon as I showed up, I was greeted by a warm and enthusiastic--handshake--by none other than Jennifer K.  She whisked me away with her gang of (all male) posse from the party that was winding down to her plan to having bison burgers somewhere uncomfortably West on Queen.  Just like that, as soon as I showed up, I was gone.  I felt like one of those asshole celebrities, but I don't associate that with a bad thing. \n\nBurger joint was closed, and so our search for an alternative became something rather of an adventure, and our adventure eventually found itself in Piola, an Italian pizzaria.  It was one of those thin crust pizza joints, only here everything was thin, including the toppings.  \nMy weight fluxuates between 180-230lb thoughout the year, the only thing that doesn't change is my insatiable appetite.  A pizza here is fifteen dollars, and it is the size of a frisbee for midget children.  The meer sight of it made me want to hug onto my money as tightly as I can.  It should be priced at five dollars and no more!  This is robbery!  \nThe d√©cor was unremarkable.\n\nAs soon as the food arrived, the cameras came out like a Western gun slinging scene.  Snappady snap snap!  Nobody seemed to mind, a seriously dedicated Yelp moment.  \nI had a total of three pathetic slices of pizza which tasted bland, and completely unfulfilling.  It took fifteen minutes to cook, and fifteen seconds for me to eat.\nIf people are willing to pay these prices for such food, then I should open a restaurant.  I make amazing Italian food!\n(Because it's so damn simple to make)\n\nI was so hungry, I ended up going to another restaurant afterwards, and Jennifer was nice enough to accompany me to...uhh...a restaurant of a certain ethnic background...^__^ hehehe\n\n\n\n....it was Chinese.
