A homoerotic breakfast? I guess this is Church street. From the wall art featuring photos of naked men ritually killed and their bodies dumped in a field to the breakfast items named after gay subcultures, the Church Street Diner is more than a breakfast sausage fest. And what great sausage they serve up. Best sausage I've ever slipped into my hungry, curious mouth.\n\nThe eggs (over easy) were nothing to write home about and the home fries lacked seasoning. Still, when you add in two slices of toast (rye bread is an option), jam, the aforementioned amazing sausage, twink-style bacon, and water sports pea-meal ham, the big bear breakfast for $10 will fill you nicely for a day. \n\nService is friendly and awesome. Decor is homey, if you ignore the photo of the ritual killing.
