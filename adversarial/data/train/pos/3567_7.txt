I have been a costco member for years. I even have an AMEX costco credit card. This location has very poor service and I felt very mistreated. I wanted to buy ONE bottle of wine. I had my photo AMEX costco credit card, but forgot my license. I've done this before and they've looked up my DOB in their database. I'm 37. At this location, they made me wait for 20 minutes,giving the impression that they were helping me out, but at the end of 20 minutes, the \"manager\" says, I can't prove that you are over 21. ??? You know, I get it. I forgot my license. but it upsets me to make me wait 20 minutes and waste my time. THEN they gave me the wrong credit card back. I had to drive all the way back after I realized it. Of course they mixed it up with another asian woman. She said it best- \"It's because we all look alike\". Awful experience, service, and wish I had never gone, and will not return.
