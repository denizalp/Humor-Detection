After a long day spent splish splashing around at Monte Carlo's lazy river, the boys and I decided to try Dick's Last Resort at Excalibur.  We were prepped by my friend Jae to expect off -the -wall, ruder than ever kind of humor.  Inside looked like a trashed up Joe's Crab Shack which I didn't mind so much I guess although, it's probably better to sit outside if it's offered to you.  \n\nThe waiters and servers were rude, crude, loud and proud of it.  TIght wads need not enter.  It was fun bantering back.  And the boyfriend and I each got a nice little slap in the buttocks by a perverted Elvis impersonator (wtf?).  The only gripe I have about this place is the food.   I think they pose as a restaurant.  Humor first, food secondary.  I mean really, secondary.  I think the best part of my meal was the root beer (and that's after they told me that they don't have Dr. Pepper ...\"or Mr. Pibb either so don't bother asking\").\n\nIf you've ever had that urge to give your waiter sh*t this is the place to do it.  And the beauty of it is that it doesn't matter whether you're joking or not.
