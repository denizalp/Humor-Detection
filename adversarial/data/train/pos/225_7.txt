I really don't why this place gets so much hype, it wasn't even good. \n\nI came here in a Sunday afternoon and we were the only ones in there. The guy working didn't even say hi, he literally looked at us walked away. He stood at the cash waiting for us to order and while we were looking at the menu he decided to put his head for a nap. LOL LIKE OKAY?! \n\nI decided to get \"purple of love\" latte without toppings mainly because it came with the boba bottle and it was taro flavoured. The service and speed of making the drinks was meh not the fastest and not the lowest I've experienced. Another worker came in to help so it was easier for the poor tired worker since more people came in after us. \n\nThe downfall was the drink itself. At first I didn't shake my drink that was stupid of me. So it was really bitter and bland. But when i did shake it properly...my gawd the amount of sugar loaded in that thing was liking a candy mans ass. I'm not sure if we can adjust the sugar levels here because the guy did not ask me for my sugar level only toppings. If I do come back I'm going to have to insist on no sugar because that was like drinking sugar. There was no taste except sweet. I even poured half of it into a cup at home to mix with more milk and it was just sweet milk no taro flavour. Waste of money. \n\nThe bottle was cute but not worth their price. I would only come back if I was dragged and I would something else for sure.
