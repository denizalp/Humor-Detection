Convenient location close to the freeway. I've stopped here on and off for several years and it's a pretty consistent location. The days of wasting my time waiting in the drive-thru are long gone with the use of the Starbucks mobile app. Ordering is a breeze and I can customize my drinks the way I like on the app. When I walk in my order is waiting for me at the pick up area and the baristas, if not too busy, give a nod and thank you as I grab it. This location has it's really busy moments, but my order has always been ready and waiting for me within the time specified. Typical Starbucks bakery and lunch items are offered here. This is an older location, so you will not (currently anyway) find a variety of seating like at newer locations, but they to have tables and chairs inside and outside. The patio outside is dog friendly.
