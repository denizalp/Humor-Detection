Do you love homeless people? Do you love practicing your chip shot on them? Boy does this golf course have a surprise for you. Come on down to Las Vegas national golf course where there are more bums then there are sand traps. Holes 3-6 have a bevy of homeless person obstacles that you will have a great time navigating around. Can't find a ball after a long drive? Check out the flamingo wash full of homeless encampments filled with many prospectors trying to sell your ball back to you.\n\nI recommend working on your short game off of hole 5, a slight tilt to the left and you have the target in the picture I'm posting with this review. \n\nLas Vegas National.. because why keep golf clean and classy when you can have all the fun of bum town inckuded
