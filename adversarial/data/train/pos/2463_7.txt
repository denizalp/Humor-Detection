Some of their food is so good you won't miss the fact it doesn't have meat. The vibrant and beautiful \"Save the tuna\" is a popular dish full of bold flavors. The lasagna -- a nightly special available during our visit -- was plenty savory with a sauce that had decent depth and ample acidity. The lone letdown was their \"Italian dumpling\" sweet potato pecan ravioli that skewed too sweet for its own good. Dishes take interesting approaches to make them vegetarian and often they succeed, but that ravioli was a miss. They even have vegetarian drinks. The lemongrass pina colada was refreshing, but was so sweet that it could have doubled as dessert. \n\nService was friendly and efficient, with our server taking plenty of time to describe dishes and answer questions. I'm a fan of the concept and, for the most part, the execution. They clearly fill a niche in the dining landscape and have enough items to satisfy vegetarians, carnivores and anyone in between.
