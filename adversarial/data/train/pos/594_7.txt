A friend told me that this place served the best savoury crepe she has ever tasted ... with that in mind, I couldn't wait to try it out.\n\nTried the Hungarian Chicken Stew crepe ... I was a little disappointed.  The chicken was ground chicken and tasted a little \"white\" aka dry.  The paprika sauce was not as savoury or fiery as I would have liked ...\n\nThe setting itself is quite nice.  We dined on the patio and it was a pleasant experience.  \n\nI think my problem is I expect a mind blowing, life altering, taste buds exploding type of experience when people tell me its \"the best\"....  \n\nIt is a very cute place :)
