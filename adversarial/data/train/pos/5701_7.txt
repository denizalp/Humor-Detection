Rico's Acai is my breakfast savior.  I travel to Charlotte often for business, and am always craving fresh fruit... like a fruit cup or anything.. which seems to be very hard to find for some reason.  One day as I was walking to work, I noticed Rico's Acai truck situated in a parking lot.  I told myself I'd try this for breakfast the next day.\n\nBreakfast the next day turned into breakfast everyday.  Rico's is my go-to for breakfast and I haven't gotten tired of it yet.  Obviously I wouldn't eat this every single day if I didn't have a breakfast allowance since it is absolutely on the pricey side.  The delicious small Rainbow Bowl sets you back almost $11.  $11 for breakfast everyday is a little bit over the top.  However, I have seen people get this for dinner or a snack after their evening workouts.  \n\nEither way, this stuff is the bomb!  I always get the rainbow bowl.  They've not had mangoes since I've been here - you either get a choice of mango or pineapple.  The granola is crunchy and adds a nice texture to the rest of the bowl.  The acai tastes fresh and isn't too sweet.  The loads of fruit - all kinds! - in the Rainbow Bowl make me happy.  \n\nThe only downside is I haven't seen them wash their fruits.  It looks like it comes straight out of the fridge in the same plastic container it came in originally..... which makes me a little ehhhh since I always wash my fruits.  Aside from that, I love this place.\n\nCall ahead if you can, because at certain times it gets really busy and you end up having to wait.  Staff here are super nice.\n\nYou'll see me here often.
