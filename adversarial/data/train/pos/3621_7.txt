Just got kicked out of this place because they have a no laptop rule between the hours of 12-4.  Every single person was on their phone and the barista could not explain to me the difference between me (working, quietly) on my laptop and all the people on their phones. This was also after me being there for an hour and having nothing said to me.\n\nSo glad I spent $10 on an overpriced coffee and a snack to be told I can't use my computer.
