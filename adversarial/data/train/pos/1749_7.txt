AMBIANCE: 3 - Regular. I mean, it's Applebee's! It actually feels a bit cramped on the upper levels. \n\nSERVICE: 4 - Excellent. Our server was very helpful and funny. She was attentive and polite. It was exactly how a server should be! I know it was slow, but she checked on us way too much! \n\nFOOD: 3 - It's true, there are big deals here and real money to be saved! They even revamped their entire menu, and I got the steak on the 2 for 25 deal (including appetizer), but I have to be honest, it wasn't good. The food at this Applebee's has just deteriorated over the years and become painfully average. Though my mom did order the strawberry avocado salad, which was probably the best thing on the menu! \n\nThe only reason I like coming to this Applebee's location is because of their happy hour (big drinks at $5-6, I think) and they've always had a great bartender that works there! My favorite Long Island comes out of this Applebee's! \n\nSo my final advice, when you're at Applebee's, (I think you know it!) \"a happy hour is a happy day!\"
