So the first time I went to the Hop, the building across the street didn't exist yet. It was just an empty lot. While I nursed a beer upstairs, a homeless guy in the empty lot decided to nurse... himself.\n\nBut that's not the Hop in Brew's fault (or IS IT?!). I've usually been here on quieter evenings, where my friends and I were able to grab a table, talk for hours about absolutely nothing and drink local brews. I once came here and had a cheeseless pizza made just for me. While that may sound like blasphemy to some, it was actually surprisingly delicious and I really appreciated that someone in the kitchen decided to make an effort for lil' ol' me. Especially since according to legend, they only serve food because the law requires them to. \n\nOn Friday nights, the upstairs turns in to one giant Hipster Bear Trap (http:\/\/yingleyangle.files.wordpress.com\/2011\/04\/hipster_trap.jpg) where counting ironic mustaches, smelly Value Vintage dresses and plaid shirts becomes a very dangerous drinking game. If they served PBR, they'd probably never leave O_o.
