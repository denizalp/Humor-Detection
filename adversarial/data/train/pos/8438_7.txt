this is EXACTLY what I would want in a delivery sushi place... \n\nI ordered sushi online at 7:30 tonight. On there website every item had descriptions so I knew what I was getting myself into and I didn't have to encounter any miscommunication issues which typically arise when ordering over the phone. \n\nthe delivery guy appeared 30 minutes after I placed my order. They have a delivery minimum of $15 and they charge a $1 delivery fee. I deducted one star because I think they can either charge the minimum or the delivery fee, but it's really like .5 star because its not a bad minimum or a bad fee. So cheers to them. \n\nI ordered yellow tail sashimi, the hurricane roll, and the KO roll. My favorite was the yellow tail sashimi; it was fresh and I will definitely order more next time. It was only one piece which sucks but it was a large cut. And it was served on a bed of thinly sliced cucumber which was not only nice presentation but a good little snack. \n\nThey give you nice chopsticks (they seemed nicer then the normal ones) and a little soy sauce dish (wrapped in the napkin). \n\nI will be ordering from this place MANY more times in the future and if they keep up their level of service and quality I see a 5 star update in their future :)
