There are some pretty good finds if you look hard enough here. Some of the staff is nice and some seem to hate their jobs. Straight faces and no smiles. That's no way to work in retail! I like how it's color coordinated, that really helps a gal out. They have a good selection of shoes here. \n\nHonestly, don't even bother trying to sell here. After being here for almost 2 FREAKING HOURS, I got $42 from selling a good bit of never worn items. One of the items being a Michael Kors bag. I hesitated to sign the agreement to accept the cash, but at this point I was so furious I just took it. I know you need to make a profit and that's how this process works, but $42 for everything that was picked out from my stash? Unbelievable. I can probably make more money selling my stuff on websites than coming here to sell. Also, it'd be nice to let people know how much you are paying the customer for their items, just saying.
