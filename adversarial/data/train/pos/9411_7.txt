Let me preface this with the fact that I know absolutely nothing about cars, and I really have no desire to learn. I have been to many Ted Wiens locations and they have all exceeded my expectations. This one, however, was my favorite. It's in a great location and I like that there are many restaurant options that I can utilize while my car is getting worked on. \n\nMy most recent trip here was for an oil change and two new tires. Everyone I spoke to was extremely friendly and professional and they did a great job explaining what they were going to do and how much it would cost. They did let me know of a few things that I may need to do in the future to keep my car running smoothly, but at no point did they try to up-sell me or talk me into getting work done that I hadn't originally planned on (like almost every other auto shop I've been to).\n\nOverall it was a great experience, which is rather bizarre, because I hate spending money on car maintenance.. I'd much rather be shopping. However, when it is time for that inevitable car maintenance, I will undoubtedly come back to this Ted Wiens.
