I'm a big fan of their Fried Pork & Chive Dumplings.\n\nThe skin is so delicate and has a nice chew. The filling is juicy and packed with flavor. I love the light crunch on the bottom of each dumpling. They are seasoned perfectly and not overly oily. These dumplings are so light and easy to eat.\n\nWe really enjoyed the Spicy Seaweed, Hot & Sour Soup and Steamed Pork & Chinese Cabbage Dumplings. We appreciate the generous serving sizes and reasonable prices. The dishes we ordered were very flavorful. We were also happy that the Hot & Sour Soup wasn't packed with corn starch. The broth was light, aromatic and had a depth of flavor. The skin in the Steamed Pork Dumpling dish was light and smooth. Very easy to eat. \n\nService needs great improvement. Once we were seated it took quite awhile for our server to take our order and bring out tea. When the server brought over our dishes, everything came out at the same time except for the Fried Pork & Chive Dumplings. When we reminded our server about that dish, it arrived to our table once we were finished with the rest of our meal. We believe they forgot to write that dish down. The employees told us the Fried Dumplings take longer to prepare but the table next to us received their Fried Dumplings before any of their other dishes came out. Restrooms are available downstairs. Seating is tight.\n\nThough service needs much improvement, the food has won me over.
