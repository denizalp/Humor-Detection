\"You can buy an assortment of fruit-flavoured bubble baths at The Body Shop for only $17.65. You can spend $99.99 for a skateboard or $24.99 for an anti-theft device for your skis at Collegiate Sports. At Club Monaco you can buy authentic Club Monaco jeans for a mere $49. And at Classic China you can get a lovely bone china chipmunk for $95. But nowhere in this Mecca of Mass Merchandising can you acquire a book of stories by the great Russian author Anton Chekhov, the greatest writer of stories who ever lived.\"\n\n-- Crad Kilodney (1988. Nice Stories for Canadians. Toronto: Charnel House.)\n\nFans of street author Crad Kilodney will always know Yorkdale as Kilodney's nightmare altar to consumerism. What Kilodney finds repellent about Yorkdale I find attractive. \n\nYorkdale is a decidedly upper class mall. You've got LV, Harry Rosen, Coach, and the rich douchebag's Ikea, otherwise known as Crate & Barrel.\n\nThe foodcourt has a Mancu Wok [confirmed]. The foodcourt also has one of the neatest audio illusions. Take a seat at the edge of the domed seating area opposite the cutest possible girl on the other side of the dome. Guess what? You will hear her voice amplified by the dome and make it appear she's right behind you, letting you eavesdrop on her conversation. Hey, remember I\"m the guy who crawls malls for thrills. You don't think I have a creepy kink or two?\n\nParking on the weekends is a nightmare unless you go first thing in the morning. Yorkdale is best appreciated by those who take the subway there.
