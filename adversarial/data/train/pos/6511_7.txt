I LOVVVEE CHATIME!! AM so happy the opened a location here. I just found out and rushed to this place (instead of driving all the way to Toronto), to get my fix. \n\nI always order #1 Chatime Pearl Milk Tea or #2 Grass Jelly Roasted Milk Tea. Truely excellent taste. Cant get this taste anywhere else!
