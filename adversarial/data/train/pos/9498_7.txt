This place was HORRIBLE!!! I thought staying at circus circus was going to be bad. F*CK NO!!!! They make circus circus seem like a 5 star resort. We stayed here because we went to their empty club (got dragged into it by a friend) and didn't want to have to drive anywhere else so we ended up staying here. The club didn't have a restroom inside (weird af and inconvenient!) So our drunk asses had to walk through the grimy casino to get to the restroom, hoping we didn't get robbed on the way! I could go on and on about this place, but I'd rather not. They definitely need to put some money into this place and maybe attract a different crowd here.
