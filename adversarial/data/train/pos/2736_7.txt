There designs are fun and sort of similar to other nail art I've had done in other cities (London, New York) but their tools (Revlon emery board?) and polish selection (they used American Apparel and Revlon polish for my mani) are not professional grade. I doubt the nail technicians themselves are certified to be honest. The paint job itself was really wonky around the cuticle, thick and bubbly which is not what you'd expect from a \"luxury nail studio\" as they've said on their twitter.
