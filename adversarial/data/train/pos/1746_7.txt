There's good and bad here.  \n\nGood = Happy hour is pretty solid.  There's always a good crowd.  The atompshere is as good as it gets for Chandler.  Staff is pretty nice.\n\nBad = The tables are packed in tight.  Tight like a fat kid's waistband after a no-holds barred Golden Corral session.  Parking is bad.  You'll probably have to park by the other businesses in the complex and huff it over.  The food is mediocre at best.  \n\nAll in all if you're looking for a happy hour spot to start the night, you could do worse.  If you're looking for a meal, head elsewhere.
