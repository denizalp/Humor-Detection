the most insulting experience ever!!!. Rude DOCTORS, the 3 of them we used....THey were getting monetary Credic card approvals every step of my pets treatment.....\n\nTHey kept pumping up the bill even they know my pet had no chance. THey wanted $400 to cremate but we took our pet to north boros for less than half that for cremation. THey are INSENSITIVE, hateful, rude and incompetent.......Lots of newbies working the ER hours.....\n\n\nWORST experience in my entire life. If there were 0 stars they would get that.\n\nTHese people are THIIEVES\n\neverybody i have spoken to hates this place and would never return
