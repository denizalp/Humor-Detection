Packed my gym bag because its the only small bag I own to avoid the bag fee. Must say I am now a master packer and am glad I didn't have to layer 6 outfits in 100+ degree vegas weather. Pretzels, beverages and air to breathe are all for a separate fee. This is like travelling those third world nation buses. I'm going to have to beg southwest for forgiveness since this spirit \"airline\" takes the shit cake for bad nightmare travel. everything shakes and makes you queasy and there are no barf bags!
