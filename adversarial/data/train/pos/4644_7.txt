I don't know how she finds them, and I sincerely believe she does her best in finding the most convenient accommodations for me when I'm working in Phoenix. But man oh man, I probably need to let the administrative assistant know more specifics about my personal preferences when booking these trips. Like I don't think being in the middle of a desolate shopping center parking lot is something I would have been seeking. Or I'm just not into burnt out bulbs on the main signage. When I came up on this hotel in an erratically driven Uber, I thought the name of the hotel must surely be Bates and that Norman was waiting for me at the reception desk to tell me my shower was in need of personal repair. \"Coming, Mother!\"\n\nMy room was oddly configured. I had a relatively comfortable King bed with an unnecessary sofa bed separated from my bed by an awkward divider as if anybody but the Waltons would be comfortable with that set-up (photo: http:\/\/bit.ly\/2earS4q). It felt like the decor was stuck somewhere during the Watergate era as I had not seen that shade of aquamarine since the Carol Merrill days of \"Let's Make a Deal\". For $89 per night, I could hardly complain especially when I saw they had not one but two waffle irons at the complimentary breakfast bar and all the scrambled eggs and bacon you could possibly eat before your first meeting. Showing off my double-barreled waffle iron-flipping skills would be my only incentive for returning.
