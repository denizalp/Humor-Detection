Open til 9:30pm during the week? SOLD!!! I was just as surprised as you. \\o.O\/\n\nWhile the other post offices have already closed for the day the cordial (as post offices go ;) and efficient folks I encountered this evening powered through and provided very good customer service.\n\nIt appeared as if patrons were impatient, but did not outwardly show it as much as I've seen during the day. Maybe it's because all of their energy had already been taken out of them because of a long day at work and a long commute home. Regardless, it was still remarkable.\n\nFour stars just for being open so late. And 4 stars for signing up to work that late.
