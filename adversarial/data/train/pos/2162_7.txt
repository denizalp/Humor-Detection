I got my puppy here. He is amazing. The staff is great as well. When we checked out she explained everything to us from when and where to take him to the vet to how to train him. We also bought the puppy kit which includes a crate and everything else you could need to get started. You also get the option to bring in your crate for a bigger one if needed and only have to pay the difference. The buying experience was made better by the team!
