I come here too often to not write a review.\n\nI'll keep this short and simple since I'm sure everyone is aware of Sweet Tomatoes. Born and raised in So Cal, this place is known as Souplantation. I still prefer to call it Souplantation anyways. It just makes more sense!!! =) So it's basically a salad bar buffet. There's also 7 soups to choose from, your pizza, muffins, baked potatoes and 3 pasta dishes. Soups and pastas can vary. It changes each month.\n\nI don't know how healthy this really is. Personally, I would like to think it's healthy for me. It sure beats the heck outta burgers, fries and tacos right?? The food here is pretty good...it helps you get your veggies and salad fix. Boyfriend and I always come here with their coupons from the weekly mailers. 2 adult lunches run about $20. Sometimes they have coupons were a drink is included.
