Finally got to try this place and was satisfied overall.  We ordered two items from both the sweet and savory menus. They brought everything out at once, so we ended up having to eat the sweet stuff first or else the waffles would get soggy. Probably not a good decision for our appetite, but we still smashed. In retrospect, maybe we should've requested the sweet to be brought out later...\n\nRED VELVET WAFFLE with Mason's Creamery's ice cream: The ice cream was the highlight. The waffle? Eh. I'm REALLY big on waffle texture. It's gotta be crisp on the outside and light and moist on the inside. This was more of a cake texture. Soft and thick. It was ok I guess, but would not get again.\n\nGRAHAM CRACKER WAFFLE: basically a s'mores waffle. Texture was the same for this one, and the waffle didn't have any flavor. The toppings were good, but the waffle disappointed and I don't know if I would get it again.\n\nDEVILED BENEDICT - Deviled eggs on smoked salmon on mixed greens on a toasted baguette: AMAZING. Probably one of the best breakfast dishes Cleveland has to offer. The salmon (aka gravlax) was amazeballs. I would come back every time for this, although it is the most expensive thing on the menu ($14).\n\nSHRIMP AND GRITS - Very good. There was a garlicky-buttery flavor that was a little overpowering in the sauce, but I thoroughly enjoyed this dish.\n\nSo despite the less-than-stellar experience with the waffles, I really, really liked the rest of our food, and I'll definitely be back. I think they could do really well if they highlighted and expanded their savory menu and put the sweet stuff in the backseat.\n\nOh, and I read that their \"banh mi\" made top breakfast sandwich in America or something, which is impressive, but the Asian in me couldn't bring myself to order it when it has very little in common with the traditional banh mi. I feel like they just called it banh mi because banh mi is popular these days, but anyway...
