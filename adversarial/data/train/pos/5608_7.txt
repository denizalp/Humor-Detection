By far the best Insurance Co I have had. Especially with my driving record. My old insurance company USAA dropped me after getting one too many speeding tickets and sent me packing to Progressive. At first I was offended and a little hurt but that was the best thing that has happened. They are GREAT... The customer service the claims reps everything. They care and act like they mean it when they ask how you are doing. I would recommend this Insurance Co to anyone that drives. A+ Service... It doesn't get any better than that :)
