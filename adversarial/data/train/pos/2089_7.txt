#30DaysOfYelp: 20\/30\n\nFirst of all, cool carnival\/burlesque theme....I loved the green fairy appearing after the first guy drinks some absinthe! I want that costume...\n\nThe acrobatics were amazing...there is this stacking chair act that I've seen before at other shows, but this one was more harrowing since we're in a small tent and not that far away from the performer. I seriously thought he was going to fall. A personal favorite is the balloon girl...she's all oiled up, and pink and blonde, super hot!  \n\nAll the performances are very entertaining, a good mix of raunchy sexiness & comedy thrown in. Penny is hilarious, if a bit annoying...but she's so crazy & weird, I love it. The only thing that made me uncomfortable was some of the homophobic, racist jabs from The Gazillionaire at random audience members. I mean, really? Gay people like it up the ass? Ha ha ha! Asian people are all Japanese? Ah-soooo camera take photo? At least he made fun of everyone & if that makes it \"even\"...white people & J.Crew, crackheads, Republicans, blacks, etc. I can take a joke, just...not all of it was funny. It was more mean spirited than being fun.\n\nI'd see it again, but I wouldn't sit in the front or volunteer for anything if you don't want to be made fun of!
