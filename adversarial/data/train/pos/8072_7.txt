my first two star rating.\n\nI have no doubt that dr.Stephens is a compotent qualified doctor. However my partner and I were not pleased with our experience despite the fact the doctor and her staff were friemdly enough.\n\nFirst its hidden in the back of the medical strip mall.\n\nThen when you walk in the size of the waiting room is about as big as a cattle chute so your all on top of each other cause they stack appointments one right after another so its you, plus everyone elses kids all shoved into a little tiny waiting room thats cut off by two doors that open into it making it about the size of an elevator and just as awkward. \n\nIm a bit of a honky...ok allota bit and we're gay, so I am a quick baramoter as to how comfortable and welcoming a place is or isnt. \n\nThis wasnt comfortable. At all.\n\nIt wasnt even really the staff so much as the clients they had a very affluent snooty better than thou attitude and I probably make more than them I just choose to not waste my paycheck on 60k vehics. \n\nAnyways I digress, back to the visit. \n\nSo after waiting forever, we were ushered into the weighing area.  Again cramped quarters!!! If your kid or you have serious \"personal space\" issues this place is gonna be a headache!\n\nAnyways this was probably the most tramatizing section for our baby girl, and the nurse was as patient as can be expected but still this office was so stuffy and sterile and rushed it made the situation of trying to calm my daughter down worse, then more freaking doors opening! The whole traffic flow layout in this place is atracious so we are all packed in like sardines and you try being shoved into a busy hallway with a screaming 2 year old that your trying to calm down just long enough to weigh!\n\nNow we are in the physicians room. Wow. Well, the granite floor was hella pretty.\n\nBut for kids they just kinda slapped up some dollar store teachers \"great job!\" paper boarders sporadicaly and put up some random yard sale picture finds. The beds were metal and not the shape of a bus or firetruck, theyre was no anything to a child feel at ease.\n\nThen we had to wait FOREVER again just to see the Dr. During this time again theres no toys or fun things to look at to keep her distracted in this tiny room full of chairs...\n\nWhen the Dr. arrived she was nice and pleasant but she doesnt mesh with our parenting values like Dr.Thomas at Pediatrics R Us in Reno (we just moved here)\n\nShe was unable to give any sort of recomendation on what we should or shouldnt do in regard to shots, and was unwilling to give us information on what our daycare would require us for sure. \n\nSo knowing full well that our daughter has a sour stomach to begin with she was perfectly ok in letting us give her 5 shots!! Ok Im not a doc, maybe this is ok. I mean in my unprofessional opinion I would think that a child whos feeling ill maybe should do two shots today and then the rest within the week since it only takes a few moments. But what do I know.\n\nThen she popped in and saw that we were cleaning up her throw up and she didnt stop and ask what did it look like, let me check her temperature again, here let me subscribe some anti naseua medication now. NOTHING PRO ACTIVE!\n\nI used to be a medic, I would think that if I would have been that proactive she should have been. God damn didnt even give us a brat diet sheet, not that it would have been much help but it would have shown some interest.\n\nSo anyways, our daughter is still puking and they finally described her some anti puke meds. \n\nShe just wasnt proactive, wasnt very conversational and kinda doctored more like a dictator rather than a caring doc.\n\nJust my thoughts.\n\nOhh but they did get us in quick.
