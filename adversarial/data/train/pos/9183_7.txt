Ok, that was delicious :) If this was any closer I'd be in serious trouble. \n\nOut with Jennifer O. (who hit the 1000 review mark today!) a group of us visited Paradise Valley Burger Co. The burgers are creative, delicious and ridiculously affordable. The Burger Brulee is served with a perfectly cooked over easy egg, bacon (who doesn't love bacon?), onion, burnt sugar and havarti cheese. The sides and shakes are great comfort food. \n\nIt may sound strange, but, french toast fries are divine. It's actually what you're (perhaps secretly) hoping will be served. Fried egg bread with a side of maple syrup. (I had one! JUST one fry.) The grilled corn on the cob is lightly buttered and a surprising addition to enjoy with a burger.\n\nAnd in other strange (yet satisfying) fare are the shakes. Bacon and maple syrup? Yup. Hot damn that's good. (Made with legit chunks of bacon.)\n\nThe setup is simple. You order at the register, pay and food is delivered to your table. The space is medium sized, sprinkled largely with 2-top round tables, which can easily be pulled together. A casual place to eat.\n\nAlas, no booze. They do have fun stuff like YelloMello and Fanta tho! The menu is kid friendly with options for the little ones.\n\nDon't drive too fast or you might pass it by. (If I hadn't been looking for the place I wouldn't have noticed it. It's to the left of a liquor store. A *drive thru* liquor store.) Pricing in PV Burger is slightly higher than their online menu. (My Brulee burger was $8, it is listed as $7 online.)\n\nDefinitely a place worth checking out!
