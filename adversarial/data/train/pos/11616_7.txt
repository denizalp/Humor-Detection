I recently bought a house and I DIDNT EVEN CHECK IF THE GARAGE DOOR OPENERS WORKED! Ugh fail. Anyhow, I was parking in my driveway for awhile and then I finally decided to address the garage door issue. Well, I contacted a bunch of places and Jeff said that he could come within 2 hours to check it out. SOLD! \n\nAnyhow, he gets there and tells me that the box thingy that can talk to the opener is broken (I'm sure you're impressed by my technical knowledge). We were going back and forth with what we could do and then he came up with the idea to put an external box thingy that can talk to the opener and door AND IT WORKED! He as fast, efficient, and most of all friendly. Now I can park my car in my garage! HUZZAH!
