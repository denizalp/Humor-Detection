THE FOOD\n\nVery good sausages that cost a little to a lot too much. \n\nApparently a good beer selection but again overpriced. \n\nYou can get your sausage sliced with a seasoned ketchup or on a bun with 2 of 4 possible add-ons including sauerkraut. \n\n4 dipping sauces available. \n\nSERVICE NOTES\n\nOrder at the counter and then sit down and wait for your food & beer at communal picnic-style tables. \n\nOn the menu they ask you to tip the \"servers\" who bring your food out to you after you've ordered it and clear your tray after you're done. I think this is ridiculous and choose not to tip. I encourage you all to do the same. Seriously, they're not really helping in any way. The counter is 10 feet away, a person with extremely long arms could do that job from a standing position. Incidentally, I would tip that person...
