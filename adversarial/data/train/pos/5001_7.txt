A very interesting place, this Bier Haus. \n\nThe food was pretty decent, although I had a poutine (gravy-covered fries with cheese curds)  The curds didn't seem warm enough, and the potatoes were large jo-jo-type fries that didn't seem cooked enough.  I mentioned to the server who agreed that regular fries would be a better execution.  The other food that came to our table seemed to look nice. \n\nThe part that was bizarre was the karaoke (Friday night).  I had assumed Bier Haus was angling for an upscale Euro-american bistro feel, but the karaoke added a very awkward twist.  I will admit, I was dragged up to the microphone by some friends, but I still don't think it fits what I would expect for this type of restaurant, and it detracted from the atmosphere more than it added.
