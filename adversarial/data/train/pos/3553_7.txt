The guy working here when I came in had such amazing customer service. He really went above and beyond to help my friend and I. \nWe came in only because my friend needed to buy gifts, but I ended up buying cookies as well.\n\nI totally forgot the employee's name because it has been a few weeks (sorry) but I think he had glasses? My friend wanted cookies in tins to gift for Lunar New Year, so he specifically wanted red tins. The staff member told us they would be releasing red ones starting Jan in preparation for Valentine's Day. He even went online to check the website for the exact dates it would be released and what colors would be offered, how long the cookies are good for, how to store them etc. \n\nWe decided to buy some other cookies anyway, but we had to get running to our spa appointment. The nice gentleman let us know that he could hold on to our purchase for us until we returned, and we could just pay when we came back and he told us the store hours. SO NICE! I felt like he went above and beyond. Originally my friend only wanted cookies, but since the guy was so damn friendly I ended up buying some as well. You guys are doing great out here in Vegas!
