This is the second car I've leased from DVNL and I've enjoyed my experience. This time, Salesperson, Chanson, helped us and he was wonderful. Very professional and pleasant to work with. I also bring my car to be serviced here because they are the best Lexus dealership I've gone too. They have a cafeteria upstairs that when I come early in the morning,  I get complementary breakfast. Also, if they take longer than expected, they will provide you with another car for the day. This makes the entire process SO much easier and minimal disruption in my day. Would highly recommend Chanson and this dealership!
