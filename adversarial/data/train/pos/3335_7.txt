Food is good but not great and the atmosphere is spacious and gives you a lot of room but unfortunately it stops there.\n\nService is abysmal and the noise level is high.  Arrived just before lunch today to give them a try.  Were seated promptly but then the long wait began. Probably four other tables were taken, one of which was a jewelry party and one by a rather large party which left shortly after we arrived.\n\nProblem was the had only one server was was both seating customers, acting as a server and bussing tables, all at the same time. We say at least three other employees while we were there but none of them jumped in to allievate the situation.\n\nWe did finally get our beverage order taken and it came out pretty quickly and the coffee was good. My wife ordered the quiche of the day which was a tomato spinach while I had the Chicken and Waffles.\n\nThe quiche was primarily just a staight quiche with only two or three bits of tomato and little else thrown in.  My Chicken and Waffles consisted of four quarters or a very small and very thin waffle along with two small breasts of chicken which appeared to come straight out of bag.\n\nThe potato sides were not bad but a little on the undercooked side.\n\nRestaurant has potential but it has a long way to go to deserve anything greater than two stars.
