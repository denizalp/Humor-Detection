This is one of those establishments that make me wish that we were allowed to give ratings in 1\/2 star increments. The location (Papago Plaza, on McDowell and Scottsdale Rd.) is excellent; the restaurant is easy to find and parking is more than ample. The staff is friendly and very attentive. The buffet offerings are one gustatory delight after another. I wanted to go for seconds for almost every dish, and knew I shouldn't because there were so many to try. You get more seafood offerings here than in most buffets, and I like that they offered fried, baked, and poached fish dishes. The dishes I found outstanding: the fried chicken, the ceviche (with tostadas!), and pretty much all the shrimp dishes. Rand H., Mike C. and I kept commenting to each other how good each of the things we got was. However, two of my favorite dishes in buffets were a disappointment here: the sushi was very bland, and the squid was rubbery-chewy. Also, although the buffet serving area was very brightly lit, I found the main dining area to be too dim; the dimness level was such that some candlelight on the tables would have been a nice and practical touch. These are the few things that prevent me from giving this buffet restaurant the full five stars. Still, the meal was very enjoyable and  in my buffet list I consider this establishment to be one for repeat visits. Four and a half stars.
