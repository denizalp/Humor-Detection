We went to vampd to see the band Mojo Rising (who are awesome) When we got there we saw 4 tables with signs that read \"reserved\" There was no hostess at the front so we had nowhere to sit and had to stand near the doorway. After a few minutes we saw either the manager or owner come close and after looking at us spoke to one of his employees about all of the people standing near the door. We thought, finally, someone will help seat us. Rather than help us out, the employee rudely said \"clear this are for the waitress to come through\" We moved in toward the stage and sat at a booth reserved for someone named \"Dianne\" We though for sure we would get served since we were now at a table. We watched as the waitress passed us by about 3 times without making eye contact. All in all we were there for 2 hours and we did not spend a penny. We left there without taking out our wallet at all. If I were the owner of this establishment I would be very concerned. In this economy only the best should stay in business. If they are not willing to train their employees then they deserve their fate. Anyway we didn't care as much because we were there to see the band. Who again is awesome. By the way \"Dianne\" never showed up.
