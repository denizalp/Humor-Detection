Not much to say about Roxu since we used UberEats to order some sushi while playing trivia at SideQuest. We tried the Tiger, Philly, and Piggy rolls and we both enjoyed everything.\n\nMy apologies, I know this review is really lame with its lack of details. I will have to stop into the restaurant sometime for a more involved experience to write about.
