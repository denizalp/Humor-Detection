It's college. There's not really much I can say about that. Of course, it's less difficult than most other schools, but there are some key classes that make up for that on the dark side. *cough* scienceclasses *cough*\n\nyour best bet is to get involved. any college experience will be boring if you don't. Fill out FAFSA--trust me, I never thought I'd qualify for anything..but I did! Take it from someone who knows! APPLY FOR SCHOLARSHIPS. Free money, hello! \n\nNone of my advisors really helped me or explain things well. I learned to do everything by myself, which is what you should do! Learn to be independent. Ask, but research first! \n\nStudying doesn't hurt you. it might be painful at first, but it's worth it in the end! \n\nI have fun at this school because I make my experience fun!!\n\nPS. Try not to transfer here from out of state colleges. They don't really like any one else's credits, true story.
