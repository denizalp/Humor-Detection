This place is serves mainland chinese hand-pulled noodles. I had the spicy brisket, which had a giant chili beside it. It was spicy, but not unbearable, as I expected it when I ordered. It was \"ma-la\" spicy meaning your mouth will tingle a bit. Weird feeling, but enjoyable. \n\nThe soup was pretty flavorful and was surprisingly clear, before mixing in spicy beef brisket sauce. I got the flat wide noodles and they were very good. Al dente with a good chew. Comes in two sizes. Small is enough for average hunger. \n\nThe space inside is tiny. Probably sits about 12-14 people at a time, so there was a bit of a line up when we went. Its pretty difficult to get a spot for groups of 3+, but 2 is generally not too bad. Generally the pairs eat quickly and leave. Service is as expected for a high turnover place.
