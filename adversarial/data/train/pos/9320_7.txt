Picked up a heart shaped pizza and it was decent. It was like $7 or something and you bake the pizzas at home yourself. It comes with instructions and clean up is a snap. The pizza isn't award winning but it's good enough for a \"take & bake\" place. They have cookie dough for sale and garlic bread too. The lobby inside is huge and seems like wasted space. Call ahead your order if you know what you want or walk in and have them make it in front of you. Either way it's up to you to bake it.
