DISCLAIMER: This review was written by a Canadian.\n\nI wandered around Scottsdale my first night in Arizona while on a business trip, and found myself pulling up a spot at Patties bar. It's a fine place to grab a beer without knowing anyone, and I took comfort in the sweet, sweet divey-ness.  Loved it.\n\nThere was a mix of locals also sitting solo the bar, who were more than willing to chat, and good classic gentleman of a bartender who seems to care about his bar and the people in it.\n\nFeel like being a little more social? There's a bunch of games to play including pool, darts, shuffleboard, and ping-pong.\n\nNow for the EXTRA special touches: \nThey had the ((ice) hockey) game on! Aw yeh! Well, at least they did, until the lady next to me exclaimed that she didn't like hockey, asked the bartender to change it, then on came this gym game with an orange ball and these hoopy-dealies. \n\nOh well, it was on long enough to win me over!\n\nEven without the game on, there was still an Oilers flag on the roof, and enough autographed hockey sticks to keep me happy.\n\nMy sudden clarity - \"Ha! They've got a 'No Guns Allowed' sign on the door. How hilariously ridiculous! I like your quirkiness, Patties, I think I'll have a drink here!\" It wasn't until later that I realized the sign was completely serious, and not at all unusual around Arizona. The more you know...\n\nThanks Patties. You guys are cool!
