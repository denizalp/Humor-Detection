Kuben has been on my radar for a very long time, but I never found the time to go until today! Unfortunately, between finding the place and actually going, it looks like there's new management. And with new management comes a change in menu and product. This also means that most of the glowing reviews for Kuben are now null. Sadly, I didn't realize any of this until afterwards. So reader be warned, there is no beef bowl. The new salmon bowl is cooked. Check the dates of previous yelp reviews to make sure they're referring to the \"new\" Kuben.\n\nI ordered the eel bowl. It was 10 dollars. There were 6 thin slices of eel, like wafer thin slices. Unlike the previous menu, you could not choose any toppings. The new menu says it's served over rice or mixed greens; I was never asked to choose and ended up getting a mix of both. There was a small smattering of sesame seeds and maybe a hint of furikake. The eel was tasty. The greens were too bitter for me. Without the personalized toppings, I felt like the bowl was pretty to look at but not very tasty. I wish they utilized the counter space a little more instead of disappearing into the kitchen to prep my food. \n\nService was friendly but not very helpful in recommendations. I was the only patron when I entered, and it took 15 minutes for them to prep my bowl. I really wanted this place to be amazing, so I'll probably revisit Kuben in a few months hoping that they'll have improved. In the meantime...I'm really not wowed by this place at all.
