AGAIN - I wish 0 stars was an option (like a few here have mentioned).\n\nVERY pushy condescending salespeople  \/ managers. \n\nCame in to look at a few vehicles that I was seriously interested in. Everything from making it a big deal to test drive a car to giving me enough time to figure out which combination of options I wanted was a no-go. This dealership operation needs to wake up and smell the coffee -- Its 2015, consumers are EDUCATED, and there are OTHER dealers that will be more than happy to earn my business. Again - it mainly the manager here who killed a deal I was getting ready to pull the trigger on. \n\nPlease people if you must have a dodge\/jeep find a BETTER dealer to work with and take your money to.  The manager was such a D*CK that I ran (not walked ran) from that dealer and will take my money elsewhere.
