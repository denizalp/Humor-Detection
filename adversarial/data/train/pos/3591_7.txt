I like to use this gas station because for some reason it's rarely busy when I stop by to fill up my tank.  It's located right off the 101 & Indian Bend Road next the the McDonald's.  I'm not the type of person to compare gas prices and drive all over town to save a few pennies per gallon, but maybe the gas prices here are higher than other stations?  I don't know.....I like the fact I don't have to zig\/zag around other cars at the pumps.\n\nReturn Factor - 60%
