The Tempe Police Department responded FAST to a terrifying home burglary and assault that my boyfriend and I recently experienced. We called 911 and a fleet of cops came knocking on our door in less than two minutes. They were quick to react, immediately advised me to get on my Cerberus tracking app, and stayed with me until the thieves were apprehended. They kept asking me if I was ok and when my adrenaline went down an hour later, they even apologized for the brute and cold way they first spoke to me. (I was like, DUDE you guys are doing your job, I'm not offended that you didn't coddle me, LOL. Apologizing was not necessary at all.)\n\nDetective Michelle Reyes was so sweet, extremely professional, and gladly answered all my questions about the case afterward.\n\nThe police technicians did take a really long time to finish fingerprinting my phone and miscellaneous items (they said it'd take 2-3 days... it ended up taking 17 days lol) but hey, I'm just glad they recovered all my stolen items in the first place.\n\nI'm honestly so grateful. Despite the terrifying ordeal, I feel safe knowing that the Tempe Police Department is vigilantly watching over my community.
