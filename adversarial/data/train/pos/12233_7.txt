This hole in the wall place serves some great chicken, but other than that it's hard to give this place a better rating than this. \n\nI tried to do an order for delivery, which they say THEY DO on yelp, but when I called, turns out I had to call a different number for someone to deliver my order. When I called that number, turned out it was a wrong number. \n\nWhen it came to ordering my food, the lady was very hard at hearing, and I couldn't really understand her. She also hung up on me abruptly. And then when my friend came to get the food, well what do you know, they don't accept credit card, it's straight up cash! \n\nOverall, I get it, it's very authentic, all the way down to the service. I probably wouldn't come back here again even though they had good chicken
