Last visit here I had the Flying Gorilla at the bar while waiting for a table, Flying Gorilla is a chocolate banana liquor shake.  This drink could be too rich for most people but I like it.  At the bar, I ordered the wasabi ahi.  And I'm so glad it was raw red in the center, the last tuna I had was cooked all the way.\n\nOther than that, the cheesecakes are stillll good.  I fancy all their cheesecakes and I seriously do not know how you can choose a favorite but if I had to, I'd go with the peanut butter cup fudge cheesecake.  I don't care about breaking out and getting pimples from eating it but come'onnnn, cheesecake with reeses pb cup and butterfingers!
