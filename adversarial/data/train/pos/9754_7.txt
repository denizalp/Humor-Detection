Not too happy with this location. Only one positive thing and it is they were able to get me in the same day within the hour that I called. It was accommodating in that sense, but I should have just waited for an opening at my new found fave spot. The girls were friendly so that wasn't lacking it was the actual wax itself. This may be a little bit too much TMI but it's a must for this one star review. I had a Brazilian done and I requested all hair to be removed. The girl did the job very fast and in the middle of my wax she did mention that I was the last client so this may be why she was so fast. She could have been in a rush to leave work. However I gave her the benefit of the doubt and trusted that she did a good job. Well I got home and she had left a lot of hair behind that I had to remove myself because it was very noticeable even in the bikini area which made no sense. So now I had to shave and will have to try to keep up with the rest of the areas until I'm due for my next wax. \n\nOn another note the same day of my wax I had shaved my underarms and trust me there's a reason why I mention this. Two days later my underarms are still free from hair, but I could not say the same for down there. I have been waxing for over 5 years and I have NEVER experienced such fast growth or lack of waxing from my Brazilian. I am very disappointed and more so that I paid $50 for something that did not last from what I am used to and did not get what I paid for because I had to go back and finish the job. I also wish I could take back the tip if I was really honest. Anyways I have learned my lesson and will not return a 3rd time.
