My update... My husband and I decided to give TÃ¤ko another try. Bad idea! I explained to the waiter that I can't handle spice\/heat well at all and asked what suggestions he could offer. He explained to me that all of the dishes were well balanced. Yes but... So he said that the mushroom tacos weren't spicy at all. WRONG! I can't comprehend why he couldn't tell me which ingredient was the spice\/heat and remove it upon placing my order. I felt he had a script and couldn't deviate from it to honestly answer my questions.\nThe guacamole was tasty and the drinks are fantastic! \nThe vibe is great and, again, the cocktails are delicious! I can't get over the incredibly spicy tacos.
