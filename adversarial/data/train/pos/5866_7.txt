Wacky Wings why do you look oh so familiar? Oh yes it's because you look like the hybrid love child of WEGZ, Wild Wing and Dooleys all in one! \n\nYou've got a cornucopia of television screens in ever possible corner, compete with a set of mega awesome screens surrounding the main dining area. Speaking of the dining area it too is massive offering a horn-o-plenty of seating options done in beach wood style tables and chairs and fencing. Surrounded by pool tables and arcade stlye games this place is a man bday party waiting to happen!\n\nService was on point this evening despite it being all you can eat wing night - we never were left to wait long for a drink, attention of food. That's right for $15 you could have all-you-can-eat wings of one flavour all night. Protip - go with a group like we did and each order a different flavour and then share. This way you can have as many flavours as your group can handle while still obiding by the one flavour per person rule.\n\nFlavours I partook in tonight were: buttermilk dill, habenero thai, spicy thai, honey garlic and spicy garlic Parmesan! Unlike the standard wing joints each of their 150+ cornucopia of flavours was delicious! None were overly vinegar-y and the spices and flavours used were excellent!! Really enjoyed the wings here - more so I have in other places for a while.''\n\nLast cool point was my $15 purchase of of a Stine of Steam Whistle Pilsner - AND THEN I GOT TO KEEP THE STINE!!\n\nSOLD! I'll be back - it's super convenient and located a short on the TO\/MISSISSAUGA border!
