During that rainy day, we were strolling along the streets of Old Montreal.  It seemed like we were the only ones in the city as we were exploring the area.  Came across Olive & Gourmando, and it was packed with people!  Guess everyone was hanging out at this cozy little cafe.  Fortunately, we were able to grab two spots at one of their communal tables.\n\nDid not try any of their sandwiches.  We wanted to try their baked goods.  They looked so mouthwatering delicious in their display as we walked in.  Purchased 4 items.\n\nBrioche Choco Banana ($3.95)\nAlmond Croissant ($3.75)\nBanana Nut Muffin ($3.75)\nBrownie ($3.75)\n\nEach item tasted quite good.  No, \"Wow\" factor with regards to the taste, though.  Would try some of their many other baked goods next time.\n\nOverall, Olive & Gourmando is a fine establishment.  Although it was a bit loud and crowded inside, I liked the ambiance.   Service and cleanliness was also fine as well.
