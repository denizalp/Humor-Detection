Holy bejeez..wtf is up with the cheap bastard complaints about the $2.00 increase on the graveyard specials? You can't even get an effin' value meal for $3.99 at Mickey D's, let alone a big honkin' steak & eggs.\n\nThis is not the place for great service or fantastic food. You don't come here to be treated like royalty, you come here to satisfy your hunger and stretch your dollars. But obviously, they're still too expensive for some of you el cheapos out there. Whining about a measly $2.00 extra for steak! \n\nIt's best for breakfast..that's all I had. Sandwiches tend to be dry and burgers over done. Steaks are hit or miss, but if you're paying graveyard prices..does it really matter?\n\nMy BF gambled away plenty of benjamins over the course of 3 days at the Orleans tables, so they generously (I'm being sarcastic here) comped us $90 worth of food at the Courtyard Cafe. \nSure, it doesn't make him even Steven..but at least we got fed!
