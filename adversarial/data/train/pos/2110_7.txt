OPEN TILL 4AM EVERYDAY!\n\nOn my most recent visit, I was sadly disappointed by the decrease in quality of the pho. My first time here was summer of 2013, and it was deee-licious. But I came again about a year later, and it was just not the same. Broth is too sweet and meat is less tender. The plus side is you can customize your bowl of pho to have whatever type of meat you want in it! Wish they had that option for all pho places haha. \n\nTo my surprise, it was renovated and the inside became much more modern and clean. The seats have been updated to cushiony sofa like chairs with a bright red color. Tables are a sleek black, much better than the old ones. \n\nVerdict...\nNot the best pho, but doable if you're looking for that hangover cure in Vegas!
