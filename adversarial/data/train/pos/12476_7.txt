Paradise Bakery &Cafe at The Falls at Ocotillo is always -- always -- busy. That's usually a sign of greatness in a restraunt. Unfortunately, in Southwest Chandler, it's more a sign of the dearth of quality eating establishments... but I digress. \n\nAt Paradise Bakery, all of the menu items are made fresh daily, and it shows. The service is generally good, although sometimes the staff still seems unprepared for the crowds. My favorite menu item is Irish oatmeal served in an oatmeal-cookie bowl. Try it. It's much better than the overrated croissants and muffins.
