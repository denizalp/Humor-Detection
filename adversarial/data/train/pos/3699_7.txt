Not only do they \"Vajazzle\" but they do pedicures too.\nAnd yes, Vajazzling is probably what you think it is.\n\nEven though this location seems to have more negative feedback than good (mostly regarding hair styling), my pedicure was okay.\n\nI came in to buy a new nail polish.  They told me to come back and check out their services and offered me15% off (I think there is a Spring special going on).  I forgot the card at home but they gave me the discount anyways.\n\nI selected my polish, they had OPI and China Glaze... it's not a huge collection of colors but it's fine.  \n\nLocated downstairs there is a small pedicure area with about 3-4 chairs.\n\nThe floor could have used sweeping.\n\nThey have a television... that doesn't really work, so you will want to grab some magazines or bust out your smartphone for entertainment.\n\nRita did my nails and she did a pretty good job.\nShe gave me a basic leg massage which was nice.\nHowever, the massage chair gives you the works.  \nWhen I mean the works, I mean that i felt violated by the chair.  I couldn't figure out how to change the massage to work only my back and I just gave up and let the chair have it's way with me.\n\nAnyways, my pedicure experience here was pretty basic...but it's also $20...  And they have a nail dryer.\n\nHowever, compared to all the other nail salons in the area, this salon is alright.  It's reasonably clean and the staff were all very nice to me.\n\nIf I don't have the time to go to my regular place, I could see myself coming here again.
