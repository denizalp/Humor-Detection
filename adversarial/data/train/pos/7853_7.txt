Super sweet helpful owner holds quiet sway from the back of this big, bright secondhand record shop on Bernard near Parc. I love that this strip is turning into destination for record shopping, and I love that the three shops are each different with unique taste and offerings.\n\nSonorama has a big selection and the records seem to be in good shape. We found some really fun disco here today and I saw a bunch of music I love that I need to make sure I don't own first before I buy it again!\n\nI love the listening stations in the front of this shop where you can enjoy the mile end passing by why you listen for your new finds. \n\nA sweet spot in a beautiful neighbourhood, one of my favourite ways to spend a Saturday.
