Flight to Vegas: $200\nSuite Hotel at the Palms: $250\nTicket to (ONCE IN A LIFETIME\/ SOLD OUT) FURTHUR show at the pearl: $200\n\n**Security's choice to DETAIN ME for 3 HOURS: PRICELESS**\n\nIf you want to party VEGAS STYLE... Don't waste your money at the Pearl. THE SECURITY IS A GANG OF LYING, STEALING, CROOKS. I was picked out of the line into the show, searched, then escorted ONTO Pearl Property, asked to sign a TRESSPASSING AGREEMENT (in which I agreed to promptly exit the venue, the hotel, my hotel suite, the palms property etc.) MIND YOU I HAD NOTHING ILLEGAL IN MY POSSESSION!!! In my refusal to agree with what was about to go down, KEVIN (Very rude, unknowledgeable, \"head of security\") escorted my into a security holding cell. I was stripped of my belongings (purse\/cell phone\/money) and was to sit until the POLICE ARRIVED! \n\nI was ready and willing to take whatever bogus citation the security wanted me to be fined with, but understand THEY NEVER CALLED THE POLICE!!! They UNLAWFULLY held me against my will for NOTHING, just long enough for me to miss the concert I had based my lengthy 1-day Vegas trip around. I could not believe the disrespect I was treated with after FULL COOPERATION with the search and following procedure. I could not fathom what power trip these clowns were on, and although I am thankful the police were not involved in the end, I was still EVICTED FROM MY HOTEL SUITE AT THE PALMS AND ESCORTED OFF THE PROPERTY. THESE PEOPLE ARE THE THIEVES OF THIEVES. THEY WILL RUIN YOUR NIGHT IF IT MEANS ONE LESS PERSON (AND $200 MORE DOLLARS) IN THEIR VENUE.\nDON'T LOOK AT THEM WRONG!!!\n\nYou would think that a venue would we ready and willing to accept eager dance-partiers, but I wouldn't be surprised if security was walking around telling people to stop dancing, that's how much faith I have in them. PUT ON A GRATEFUL DEAD RECORD you arrogant imbeciles. A good venue would predict what type of people is attending their show, and realize their efforts spent on me were a COMPLETE WASTE OF BOTH OF OUR TIMES. (When people were trying to sell who knows how many illegal substances!?!)\n\nTERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE ON TOP OF IT! I have made numerous phone calls to the Pearl, they are refusing to refund my money, and continue to hang up\/ignore\/or re-direct my phone calls. My lawyer is now involved and THE COUNTLESS FRIENDS AND FAMILY I HAVE IN THE MUSIC INDUSTRY WILL NEVER PLAY AT THE PEARL AGAIN. Thank you for ruining my LAST CHANCE to see Furthur. (Seeing as they are taking hiatus after this tour). I will never spend another cent at the Pearl.
