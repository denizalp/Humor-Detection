I'm not sure where to begin... I have never been to a savers, but my boyfriend wanted to get some stuff. As I walk in, there was this smell, I cannot describe. Almost had a walmarty smell, so I knew instantly, this was going to be where I die. We go to the book section and I was surprised by the selection. They had a decent amount of books for a really cheap price. Picked up the complete works of Shakespeare for only $3 dollas wanna make me you holla!!! Looked around for clothes and what was weird for me, but may not be weird for others, there were bathing suits. I wondered, what if the previous owner had crabs, or had gross discharge etc? Granted, they must clean the bathing suits, but the thought of that petrified me. I wouldn't wear used underwear, so I just didn't understand used bathing suits, but to each their own. Some clothes had stains in them and holes in them. The quality and overall cleanliness of the store was unacceptable. Would I ever come here again? Probably not or maybe Only for books. Another thing that creeped me out, the naked Barbie dolls stuffed in plastic bags. Lol, it was a bunch of them individually stuffed in plastic bags. It was like walking into a basement of a killer and asking you to puts the lotion on.
