Ghost chili hand roll challenge. If done in 30min, pic on \"wall of flame\"!! Serious!\n\nbut after all im here for the fish and it barely passes.\n#yellowtail fishy, not fresh\n#tamago ordered in (not fresh) arrives frozen, microwaved defrost. Epic fail.\n--great salmon, but that's easy.\n#miso has no tofu, too salty, somehow creamy, flakes of seaweed, not pieces like im expecting\n#Ama ebi frozen also must be microwaved to order.I'm just sayin'.\n\n--very friendly, attentive service as mentioned by others, but\n--sushi chef is explaining that they just don't do the serious stuff 'cause no one orders it. WHAT?!!\n\nDood. If you can't do it right, then don't serve it.\n\n\nNow, about the GHOST CHILI CHALLENGE\n\nOkay, so I can finally say I've had my taste of Ghost Chili. It is an experience like no other. The instant it touches your tongue, it's like someone set it on fire. And it just escalates from there. Up, up, up, up. Hotter. Hotter. The pain is excruciating. Naturally you swallow, but that was a mistake. You should have spit it out. Even with soy milk, the next 30 minutes are sheer agony. No amount of squirming, wringing of hands, gritting of teeth or yelling will help you.\n\nAnd that was from one bite. There are but 5 pics on the wall, and according to chef, all of them had downed the roll in two or three bites. Mistake. An ambulance ride, and a night of morphene-induced sleep is your only escape. You must sign a waiver before you begin which includes a line warning of possible eminent death. WOW that was hot.\n\nHaving said it, I'm glad I tried it. Those who say you can take any level of spicyness, this Yume is your final resting place and without the 30-hour plane flight to India where they're grown.
