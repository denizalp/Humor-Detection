Ru San's for me can be a hit or miss but Friday the food was really good. I like sushi so  I may be bias to this review; nevertheless, you should read it even if you don't like sushi.\n\n Okay first off why isn't there half stars on here? I always ask myself that because it's rare that I'll ever give something 5 stars! \n\nSo it was super busy! Always a good sign and sat outside and it was great. The server was quick and funny as well. I highly recommend trying something you haven't tried instead of your plain old California Roll! Boring! :\/ \n\nGo for a Bento Box or something crazy like Eel to give your tongue something different. Yum! \nI had the Exotic Roll, Spicy Tuna, and Avocado Roll. I must say the Avocado Roll was ON POINT SON! That roll I would give 5 stars ! :D
