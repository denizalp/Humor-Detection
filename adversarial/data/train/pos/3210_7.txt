I drive well out of my way to go to this Midas. I think that says it all. \n\nI was so upset with the lousy service from the associates at the Big-O Tires on McDowell and Scottsdale that I needed to take my business to someone who treats their customers with respect and appreciation. \n\nThe associates at Midas are very courteous, expedient, and very thorough when reviewing all your car's information with you. I apologize for not knowing the gentleman's name at the front counter, but he is a true service professional. \n\nThey have earned my loyalty, and I hope more people come to this Midas to experience how auto mechanic shops should be run.
