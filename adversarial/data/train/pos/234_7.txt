I don't openly announce my affection for PF Chang's.  Growing up in the San Gabriel valley surrounded by real Chinese food I sometimes wonder if I'm allowed to enjoy this candy-like addicting concoction they serve here as food.  Proper or not, I like PF Chang's!  Although it's not the best food, it's tasty and it sure makes my mouth happy.\n\nI mentioned in my previous blog that mom was visiting from Korea.  We went to Vegas and stayed at Planet Hollywood.  While my hubby was playing poker, mom and I decided to eat at the PF Chang's located inside the hotel.  It is here that my mom's obsession with this restaurant starts all over again. \n\nWe always order the Garlic Noodles.  We LOVE this dish.  We also ordered the Chicken Lettuce Wraps that we enjoy.  We sat out in the patio and blissfully soaked in the fair weather while munching happily on our lunch.  Even our strange & annoying server who kept complaining to us about her other table of customers and kept trying to overcharge us (I had to tell her to fix our bill twice) couldn't ruin our meal.
