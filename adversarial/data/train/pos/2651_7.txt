I wanted to check a couple of bloods so pottered along to my friendly local family doctor, Dr Stendardo at Appletree in Village by the Grange (http:\/\/www.yelp.ca\/biz\/appletree-medical-centre-toronto).  It was another efficient visit.  He printed off the necessary forms and I trotted off.  The laboratory indicated was this Gamma-Dynacare on Edward Street nearby.\n\nI Googled beforehand and found some one star reviews so I wasn't particularly hopeful.  I was worried about long waits because I knew I'd have to pop out of work to get the test done (their hours are pretty much office hours) so phoned one afternoon to enquire.  I was told I could go in right then if I wanted and the wait wouldn't be long.  I went the next afternoon instead.  It was the day before Canada day, just before a long weekend so I thought it would be busy and chaotic.  It was anything but.  The lab is on the 8th floor and I strolled right in with my form and OHIP card and presented them at the desk.  The friendly reception staff started entering my details and then directed me to a cubicle.  I had barely sat down when the phlebotomist came in to take my sample.  He was friendly and quick.  I barely felt the needle and next thing I knew I was collecting my OHIP card and heading back to work.  Couldn't believe how quick and easy the process was.  There had to be a catch!\n\nThere was no catch.  I was called to get my results the following Wednesday which was pretty efficient considering the long weekend in between.  No wait, friendly people, skilled phlebotomist and pretty rapid turnaround time?  Yes, I'm a fan!
