I will now pay Fuel the biggest compliment that a Jersey girl who went to school in NYC can pay a pizza place: Fuel's pizza reminds me of home.\n\nThe crust is the proper thickness and consistency. The sauce is seasoned but not to an extreme. The cheese is nice and melty. There is red pepper flake and garlic powder on the tables (There is also grated cheese but I refuse to acknowledge that it has any right being on a slice). The garlic knots will give you breath to knock out a dog (this is a desired result). There is a respectable beer selection to wet your whistle. And most importantly, very most importantly, they are perfect folding slices.\n\nThey are open nice and late so Fuel is great for a post-bar food fix. If you are getting delivery (because sometimes you just don't want to have to put on pants to get delicious pizza) I highly suggest the online ordering for ease and convenience.
