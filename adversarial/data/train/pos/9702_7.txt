Went here for lunch today after a long day at the Convention Center for the builder's show.  It's approximately two miles away and conveniently located on Paradise and Flamingo.  You walk in and definitely get the vibe of being in the Bahamas.  Fresh water flowing, tropical decor everywhere and many choices of rum mixed drinks with flavors that bring you back to paradise at sea.\n\nItems Ordered:\n- Firecracker Shrimp (Appetizer)\n- Jerk Chicken Fettucini (Entree)\n\nMy initial appetizer was quite good and I'm not sure what the sauce was made from, but it was very flavorful.  Was definitely in the caliber for bang bang shrimp from Bonefish Grill.  The jerk chicken Fettucini definitely had a nice kick after each bite and made my taste buds crave more.  The portions for both entree and appetizer were extremely generous and I'm so glad I split my meal with my wife.  I really wanted to try the pineapple mixed drink, but unfortunately I was in working hours.  I'd definitely like to come back for happy hour and try other items on the menu.
