\"Classy\" and \"buffet\" usually don't go together, but the Wynn nails it: their buffet is the best dinner buffet on the Strip I've had thus far. It ought to be, for the price ($40).\n\nStations represent different \"ethnic\" foods, your typical Indian, typical Chinese, some Thai. The salad bar was fresh and inventive. The lamb was amazingly moist, the highlight of the meat offerings. The charcuterie was an unexpected treat, little pickles and all, and the dessert area impressed me, even without a sweet tooth. Of course, king crab legs never disappoint.\n\nFriends and I decided to celebrate a birthday here, so after we let our server know, we were provided a dessert assortment, complete with candle, while waiters sang \"Happy Birthday\". Thoughtful!\n\nThe buffet has a ton of seating, and you don't feel like you're on a farm thanks to strategically-placed partitions which provide a sense of privacy. The ambiance is money - one should expect nothing less from the Wynn.
