Stayed here for a conference in the hotel. I think that's the only reason why anyone would stay here. Otherwise, Mandalay Bay is way too far from the action.\n\nI checked in at 4pm, which is pretty late and leaves ample time for the hotel to clean the rooms.\n\nI get into my room and things are off:\n\n- door jams so you have to really push to open it\n- half used lotion and shampoo bottles\n- exposed, faulty looking wires\n- dirty, used sink\n\nClearly didn't take the time to clean the room thoroughly. The room just looked like it needed a major overhaul. Also, when the front desk gave me a room, she stated that it was on a higher floor, which I appreciated-until I realized it was the lowest floor in my building.\n\nCould have made a big stink about everything but was only here on business. Won't ever return.
