My first visit at Lobby's was a good one. There was no one there when my boyfriend and I arrived. We couldn't tell if it was even open. I liked the fact that the place is simply decorated  and clean. \n\nThey don't have much on their menu, just burgers, beef sandwiches, and hot dogs with all the fix-ins you'd want to put on them. I really liked how they're burgers are hand-crafted and they make their own roast beef for their sandwiches.\n\nTheir prices are good  for the quality of food you get. The combo is well worth it, for an extra 2.79 you get a large drink and a large amount of fries. \n\nIt's a good place to take a family and some friends, its a nice and quiet place with very friendly staff.
