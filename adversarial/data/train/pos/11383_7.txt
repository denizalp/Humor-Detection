As far as airports go, I always love having layovers here. What other airports have slot machines?! Last time I was there, I put in $1, and won $2.41! Woooo hooo. That's how I roll. \nIt's a clean airport, with lots of chairs. This place has more outlets than any other airport I've ever seen. They're everywhere! Other airports can be challenging to find a place to plug in all your gadgets. But not Vegas! \nThe murals are cool, love the public works of art in here! \nIt's fun that there are different types of restaurants in here, but check out those Yelp ratings!
