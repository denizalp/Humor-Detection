The food, eh it's just okay. The service, random, depending on your waiter\/tress. Either way, it's nice to have a new dining option in the sector. \n\nWhile I do work right upstairs, 14th floor, cube 14012 (j\/k), this isn't my first lunch restaurant of choice. Still, worth a try and with a $5 lunch menu, can't really go wrong. \n\nOh and BTW, if you're looking for a hot wing, this might be just the place you're looking for. Wings so hot it took me 10 minutes to eat just one. Not to mention I swear I almost passed out.
