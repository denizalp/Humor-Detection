When asked where was their Pho in the menu, it was listed under Tonkinese. The heck is Tonkinese??\n\nSo I got their Pho and was it bad. Just shreds of one kind of beef. No tripe, no brisket, no rare steak, no tendons etc. And no basil leaves. It came only wih bean sprouts and a 2 sad looking shriveled up sprigs of cilantro.\n\nThe only good thing about eating here was the strong US dollar.
