I went there basically looking for a specific front door. The manufacturer's website said Hoke Lumber was one of their retailers. I dealt with a salesman who acted like he could care less whether he helped me or not. I spent about 30 minutes working with him to identify the door. He finally thought he could locate one and told me he'd work on it and call me back by Monday (this was a Thursday). Monday came and went. As a matter of fact, the entire week passed. I stopped in again the following Monday. Again, the guy acted angry that he was even having to deal with me. At first he didn't even remember me, and when he finally did, he had to dig my paperwork out from under a pile of papers on his desk. He told me the sales rep. for that manufacturer had been in and they had discussed the door. He thought he could get one but would need to follow up with the rep. Again, he told me he'd call me to let me know. It has been 4 months and I have yet to hear back from the guy. I basically gave up on Hoke Lumber. Perhaps someone just looking for a single door isn't worth their effort, but I have to say I will never spend a dime in the place because of the way I was treated. Deal with them at your own risk (of your time and aggravation).
