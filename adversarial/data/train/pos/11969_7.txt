Check it out.  Great location overlooking the lake.  Nice view.  If your are biking, running or just looking to relax this is a good spot.  Many beers on tap and nice menu with some vegetarian options.  The place was busy.    \n\nDon't forget the soup, like our waitress did!  Good soup, soup of the day was a vegetarian Southwest.  Very good with some nice spiciness.  Pedal paddle panini was loaded with mozzarella, roasted red peppers, sliced tomato and fresh basil.  Very good, wish it had a tad more basil thou.\n\nOur waitress worked hard and was busy but could probably use a few training sessions.
