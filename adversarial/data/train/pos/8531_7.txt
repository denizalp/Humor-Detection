I honestly love this place, it's a lot different in price from sushi station down the street but the quality is worth it. I have had some of the most delicious sushi here. all very fresh tasting too.\nHappy hour is a good time to come in if you just want a couple of sushi rolls and a yummy cocktail for cheaper than usual price! \nAnd for a dessert I would suggest the green tea waffle with vanilla ice cream on top. It's to die for!
