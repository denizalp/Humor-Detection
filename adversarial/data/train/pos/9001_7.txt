Thank GOD they opened a Lowe's by me.  I doubt you'll ever find me in a HD again.  \n\nI have never felt so dumb as when I was forced into Home Depot the other day.  Just because I look like I have no busines being in a hardware store, doesnt mean that I have no business being in a hardware store.  I have money to spend dammit!!  Cut me some freaking slack.  \n\nI had to search high and low for a \"friendly sales representative\" who was stick-up-their-ass crabby at best, and watch them look at me like a moron when I asked what aisle a laser level would be in.  I'm no Tim-the-Toolman-Taylor but I think thats a pretty common item.  QUIT LOOKING AT ME LIKE I SHOULD BE AT A BAR SOMEWHERE AND SHOW ME THE LEVEL AISLE.\n\nI also needed help carrying a huge ceiling fan out of the store.  This is not unreasonable but the clerk and helper-guy looked completely put out.  You work at HOME DEPOT you jerks, lend an effing hand.  \n\nThe only reason this crap shoot gets 2 stars is because its always pretty clean, its has a boat load of stuff if you know where to look, and the worker's uniforms are all a lovely matching orange.  Thats it.
