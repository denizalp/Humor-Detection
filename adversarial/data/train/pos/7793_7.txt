As a first-time home buyer, I was very nervous and wasn't sure where to turn to find a realtor. One of my neighbors highly recommended Danny and the Myriad Group, I'm very glad she did.  The whole process went smoothly, Danny and Katrina were always quick to respond to any emails, texts or calls.  They both made sure I knew what to expect every step of the way.  Everyone I came into contact with at Myriad were absolutely great.  I'm proud to say I'm now a first-time homeowner and very grateful to the Myriad team!
