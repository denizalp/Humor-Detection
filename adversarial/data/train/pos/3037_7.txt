I enjoy froo froo drinks as much as the next person, but I go to a coffee place for coffee and I judge them by their coffee. Meaning drip coffee. I believe that if you have coffee in your business name, you should have good coffee. Not here. As I sipped my Brazilian blend this morning, I wished I would have went to Starbucks instead. Not nice, I know. I want to patronize small businesses, but not at the expense of my taste buds.\nI see really good reviews for this place, but they seem to be for drinks that are not drip coffee.\n\n2 stars for the nice relaxing atmosphere.\n\nEnjoy, anything but the drip coffee.
