Sometimes the very best restaurants are right in your own backyard and you don't even realize it. Sarafino's has been around for years but I have never taken advantage of it until now.\n\nIt is an all Italian restaurant where you can order most any type of pasta, pizza, and paninis. They have vegetarian options as well. Stopping here for lunch with my daughter I was debating about ordering the wedding soup but realized that with my panini and pasta salad that would be a little too much to eat.\n\nMy chicken panini was made cooked to order. The pasta salad was fresh. I simply enjoyed my meal. My daughter ordered a 10 inch cheese and mushroom pizza. You can also order it in 16 inch size as well. She ate the whole thing and loved it. The also offer appetizers and main courses if you are so inclined.\n\nLocated on East Crafton Ave near the borough building parking may be a bit difficult since there is currently construction going on the nearby Noble Ave and many people parking in this vicinity to take advantage of the busway. \n\nOpen for both lunch and dinner, prices are fairly reasonable and definitely will return here on a future visit to check out their other offerings.
