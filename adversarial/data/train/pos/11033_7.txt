I was really excited for this place to open since I love bubble waffles but I just didn't get my fix here.\n\nI called ahead to make sure of their hours and once confirmed, they also informed me that they were out of bubble waffles and it was a couple hours before closing time. So we were bummed to say the least but decided to head over anyways to try one of their boba drinks. \n\nUpon arrival we were told that they were making a new batch of waffle mix and it would be ready in 5 minutes so we were glad now that we came by.  \n\nWe ordered our own waffle combo. I had the plain bubble waffle and chocolate ice cream and my husband ordered the all matcha (green tea) one.  Both looked great but the waffle taste was not just too plain, ice cream was good but we really came in to try the waffle.   We also ordered a taro smoothie and a Hokaido Milk Tea.   Sadly these were very disappointing.  They use powders for all drinks, and were not good tasting at all.  \n\nI will say the place is cute and the staff was very very nice and accommodating, apologizing for the wait and just overall welcoming.  They just opened this establishment so I will give them that and may wait a while before trying them back and hopefully updating my review.
