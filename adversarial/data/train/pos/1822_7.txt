Da bomb dot com! After a month of self deprivation (Trying to look cute for summer time nah mean?) I finally gave in and visited The Wilcox. I did my research ahead of time, and made sure to order all of the dishes with good reviews. Can't say enough about this place, everything I ordered was perfection. \n\nBuck a shuck oysters on Tuesdays & Wednesdays was really what pulled me to give in. The oysters we're on the small side, but it did the job of satisfying my cravings and for only a buck, take my money! \n\nFish tacos: Refreshingly delicious, and exactly what it should have tasted like. I've had fish tacos before, but never any good ones in comparison to when I had them in LA. The tortillas were super soft, the fish was lightly battered topped with a smooth guac and sweet salsa mix. It was perfectly seasoned and not very fishy tasting for a fish taco. \n\nDuck poutine: Amaze-balls! Fries were crispy yet there was enough gravy and duck to hit pan. Who would have thought duck would make such a great topping to a poutine. The meat was so tender and pulled apart at each scoop.\n\nScotched eggs: Interesting, very very interesting. To be honest I had a little one too many drinks by the time I had this dish lol. Crispy yet savory..that's all I remember.\n\nI'm definitely coming back. The End
