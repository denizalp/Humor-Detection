Came here for dinner around 7:30 pm. Been wanting to try this place out and finally here I am. AYYYY. Overall, I think it was an okay experience. \n\nThis place is technically a tad bit more advanced than compared to other AYCE places. Instead of having to say what you want to the servers or checking off whatever, YOU USE IPADS. WOT WOT!!! AND YOU DONT EVEN NEED TO WAIT FOR THE SERVERS TO COME AND CONFIRM YOUR ORDER. They're sent to their systems in like a minute or so.\n\nFood wise, there is quite a lot to choose from. Generally, their stuff aint too bad. There were only a few that stood out. Some of their sushis were pretty bomb. I would say what they were if ONLY I REMEMBERED LOOOL. You see, I haven't eaten since 9 in the morning (bad scheduling of classes lawl -_-) so HOMEGIRL WAS HELLA HUNGRY. LIke I just chose whatever and ATE whatever. Oh, I just wanted to mention the only thing I remembered and HATED SO MUCH AND IT WAS THEIR BEEF TATAKI HOLY SHIT BALLS YALL I WAS EXPECTING IT TO TASTE LIKE WHAT I HAD AT THE EDO TEPPAN AT DISNEYWORLD BUT NONONONNONONONONO IT LOOKed LIKE A MESS AND TASTED LIKE A MESS and god dam it was like I was chewing gum ffs; i tried so hard to gulp it down, but my throat was like nuh uh son not today. DEFINITELY DO NOT RECOMMEND\n\nPros:\n- lots of foods to choose from\n- some of their sushi rolls are pretty damn bomb\n- fresh sashimi (loved the surf clam and octopus)\n- ipad ordering system\n- very good coke (it tasted so good here?@! for some reason?!)\n- manager is pretty cool and nice (cant tell if hes like that always or just because we were VIPS)\n- pretty attentive staffs\n- have thai food options (im confused bc its supposedly a \"jap\" restuarant, but its cool wuteva)\n\nCons:\n- many of the things i ordered didn't come\n- some things came out super slow\n- beef tataki is a no bueno\n- interior is meh; rather dark and feels like a dennys restaurant to me\n- pretty expensive ($28.99 for adults at dinnertime)\n\nALthough, it was a relatively okay experience, I don't know if I want to come again. There's definitely better places out there. so yah. yah.
