Forgot that I saw a sign stating that a new Taiwanese eatery was going to be opening in the same strip mall where 168 Supermarket is located at.  That was at least a few weeks ago.  Fast forward or mentally fold space time like you would fold origami cranes to Stardate -311352.18 (http:\/\/plaza.ufl.edu\/joec\/startrek_stardate_system_explained.htm).  So after being denied my original dinner option at LBS, because they decided to close shop a full hour early, I ended up almost going to Hong Kong Garden (located right next door) before I spotted another new restaurant to try. YippeE!\n\nAnd thanks to Jenny W.'s review, I decided to try their Beef Noodle Soup, which I thought was very authentic (without using bovine parts from 100% Taiwanese \"yellow\" cows).  Yeah, Taiwanese are still freaked out about the Mad Cow Disease and potentially radioactive cows from the Fukushima Daiichi fallout.\n\nMaybe I was really hungry by the time I stepped through the welcoming doors of Taiwan Kitchen, but I thought the beef noodle soup was FANTAstic.  The noodle was extra delicious and the side of preserved vegetables plus the tender beef (in spite of the pieces being mucho grande) were extra nom nom packed with serious yum yum deliciousness, not to mention that the beef broth was wonderfully flavored with a hint of spicy kick. You can literally cook a regular package of instant ramen and serve it in that beef broth and have people raving about it. I think it was that good.  But I could have been delirious from finding another good spots for Taiwanese Eats.\n\nThey also offer boba smoothies made with real fruits.  Nelson Q is definitely going to have to check this place out.\n\nAnd just for Jenny W. next time I will find out what is in the cabbage side dish.\n\nUntil then, eat and be merry.\n\nService:  3.5\/5\n\nDecor\/Ambiance:  3\/5  No frills, but that is okay.  I am not here to eat the decorations anyway.  Too much fiber gives me gas!\n\nParking:  4\/5  Always plenty of parking in this part of the parking lot.\n\nPrice:  4\/5  Reasonable!  \n\nFood\/Taste:  4.5\/5  Go back and read paragraph 3. Twice if you have to and kindly correct any grammatical errors.\n\nComposite Score:  4 stars.
