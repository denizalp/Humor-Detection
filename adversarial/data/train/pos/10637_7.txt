With all my visits to Montreal and what people have been raving about it as the top 3 to get in mtl (poutine, maple syrup, and smoked meat) so I defiantly had to see what the hype was all about. I came here and ordered a smoked meat sandwich and a beer and ahh man let me tell you, coming from NYC with our roost beef and ruebens, this by far was awesome. The meat was tender and soft as if they cared and loved for it before shipping it to the store. Honestly, when looking at it, it looks like a regular sandwich but that 1st bite full of flavor makes you want to buy another one before even finishing the entire sandwich. *fyi I had smoked meat poutine at another place the following night and the meat did not compare with the sandwich
