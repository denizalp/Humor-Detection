Stopped in here after an event with a few of my Yelp friends. This is in one of those restaurant spaces that has seen a high turnover in recent years but I think Kid Cashew is going to be very successful here.\n\nThere are a few different seating options here. On the left side of the restaurant are a few 4 seater bar tables. Across the aisle from those is a large family style table of at least 20 seats. To the right of that table are a few round tables and against the right wall are smaller tables with bench seating against the wall. There is also seating at the bar in the back and a large patio out front so there are plenty of seating options.\n\nThe menu consists of small plates and items to be shared with a few sandwiches and salads mixed in. They also have a craft cocktail selection, local craft beer and a decent wine selection.\n\nWe had a group of 6 and we all ordered something different so we could sample each others meals. My selections were the portobello mushroom sandwich and the brussels sprouts.  The mushroom burger was really good with a good mixture of flavors. I'd put it in my top 2 of local portabello sandwiches. The brussel sprouts were good but some of them were a little undercooked. I was able to sample some of the other plates at our table. The lemon-oregano chicken sandwich is an open faced sandwich with great flavors. The wood-fired beets were the real winner in my book.  \n\nDespite being advertised as small plates and sharable items, the portion sizes were decent and actually on the large side of small, if that makes any sense.  \n\nI thought the service was great despite the fact they were busy. Our server, Joshua, was amazing and everyone else helped out where they could. \n\nI definitely plan to visit this place more often, especially since I live so close.
