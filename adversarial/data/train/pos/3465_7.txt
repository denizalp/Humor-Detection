I've been here several times and it's a great setup for outdoor concerts\/show. \nParking is ample and the venue is contained. \n\nDepending on the show\/festival, there are different retail and food vendors that show up. \n\nFor the recent jazz festival, everyone brought their own lawn chairs, and coolers for an all day picnic. I think this may depend on each festival and their restrictions. \n\nOverall, I am looking forward to attending more events here :)
