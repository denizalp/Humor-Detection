We rolled up to this place at like 8:30 one night thinking it would be closed and that we would just take a quick look at their inventory and maybe check out the Cube.  All the advertisements for them on Yelp have intrigued me.  Lucky for us they weren't closed and Carlos came out to help us.  He was a friendly guy, a little bit awkward, but he had an average to above average knowledge of the product.  He showed us the cars they had available and became more enthusiastic as time went by.  We had a nice experience here and would come back if we decided to purchase.
