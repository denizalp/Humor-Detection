The first low review on this page and no, it's not based on their tattoos\/artwork. I've followed many of their artists on social media and love their work. They have many great artists that have extremely clean lines and bright colours.\nHowever.. having a rude and awkward front of the line customer service representative sitting at the front is the reason why this rating is so low.\n\nBefore I even got my first tattoo, it took a lot of courage to even take a baby step into this shop. As soon as I went in, nobody in the shop even batted an eye at me. Did I accidentally step into an invisibility cloak when I came in?\nThe guy at the front continued chatting on the phone and did not even acknowledge my presence.. could've at least gave me a look or even hold up a finger so I know you can see me. Keep in mind.. I was standing literally a feet away from his face.\nWhen he finally got off the phone (almost 10min later without any acknowledgment), he just looked in my direction and slightly nodded as in \"ok tell me what you want now\"... no \"sorry to keep you waiting\" or \"Can I help you?\"\nWow man.. your customer service is so good.. slow down, I can't keep up.....\n\nI asked him how much it would be to get 3 chinese symbols on my shoulder blade and he said it's impossible to get chinese symbols there .. (now that I think about that... WHAT?????) then I said it could be shortened, and he told me it'd be 250-300$..... LOL OK BYE. He didn't even confront any of the artists to ask, like a lot of professional shops would. He just seemed like he wanted to get rid of me.\nI'm pretty sure he wasn't even an artist there, just some unfortunate excuse for a human that chronic ink put up at the front because he has no purpose in life.\n\nChronic Ink at pacific mall is a joke. And this is why nobody wants to go into your shop- perhaps if you get rid of the braindead monkey at the front. \nPeople reading this interested in getting a tattoo.. you'd have much better luck at phat buddha upstairs.
