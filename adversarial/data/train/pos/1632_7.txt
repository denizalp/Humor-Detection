The Good:\nThis place is awesome! Real food for the masses at real prices. Everything comes out fast and tastes great. \nThe Bad:\nThey only take cash and it's not the most pristine place in the city or even the area but it that bothers you stay out of the Slavic village. \nMy Take:\nLooks can be deceiving and the best food comes from places that spend more time perfecting their product than getting the joint all fancy for the schmucks out there :)\n\nCheers!!
