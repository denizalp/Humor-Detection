Right, write a review about a courthouse and jury duty.\nListen jury duty is a civic duty, so just do it.\nThis courthouse is Large, I mean huge, tall, it's big.\nThe bathrooms were clean, however, some of the stalls did have broken locks, not too happy there.\nLarge rooms with padded (read comfortable-ish) chairs. So, no sitting on the floor like a little hippy.\nStaff is doing their best with many, many people to put to the process of jury selection.\nPlease dress properly. I know it is Vegas, but please show some respect for the court. Also slow up on the cologne, whew. Take it down a notch Sparky, the rooms are big but come on.\nOverall, good experience here. I was not chosen, but I got as close as I have ever gotten!
