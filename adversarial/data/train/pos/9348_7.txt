Here's what you can expect if your greyhound manages to get into a bag of extra large Greenies and eats 15 of them before you find out.\n\nCall Great Lakes Veterinary Hospital because they're the only emergency vet on the east side of Cleveland. Someone named \"Sarah\" tells you to definitely come in right away so that they can do an examination and make the dog throw up if necessary. So you load up your pooch into the car and make the 25 minute drive.\n\nYou arrive at the hospital. No one there is named \"Sarah\" or remembers you calling. You tell them what's going on, you wait for a while, and then they take you back to a triage room. You tell yet another staff member what happened. She goes off to consult with the real vet - not sure what exactly her qualifications are. She comes back into the room 15 minutes later and says that they won't do anything before you call Poison Control.\n\nEven though they told you to drive your dog over.\n\nYou try to call Poison Control. Turns out the animal poison control is a for-profit hotline that will charge you $60 for a 10 minute consultation and isn't even a 24 hour line. \n\nAt this point, realizing that VCA Great Lakes Veterinary Hospital is run by a circus of incompetent troglodytes, you and your dog leave, get back in the car, and drive across town to Animal Emergency Clinic West, where they act like actual veterinarians and give your freakshow of a greyhound an x-ray and you find out that all she needs is some Gas-X.\n\nFriends don't let friends go to VCA.
