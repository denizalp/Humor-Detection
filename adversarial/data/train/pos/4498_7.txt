A friend recommended this place (clearly she was too drunk to accurately recall being here) so I thought I would check it out for a girls night out. The worst idea ever. It took 20 minutes to get seated AT THE BAR and the bar tender was awful. She favoured the male clientele (obviously she thought they would tip her more than our group) and her butt crack was out the entire time. (Her crop top was also inappropriately short and her trashy arm tattoos did nothing for her) to make matters even more raunchy, my pal caught her PICKING HER NOSE right before putting a lime on a customers beer. GROSS!!! Will not be returning here.
