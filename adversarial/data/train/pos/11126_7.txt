This trendy hip store is located in a strip mall in downtown corridor of Phoenix. Shopping in the area lead me to this place. The hip window display is what brought me in. I happen to find more in the store that I liked then did not like. I ended up buying a quality piece of luggage. They offer both male and female clothing, accessories and gifts. The staff was super helpful and made the shopping experience fun. \n\nI will be back as they have a unique sneaker collection and some really cool Adidas items.
