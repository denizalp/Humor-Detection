Here's the T! I like riding the light rail. Ideal for commuting or for a quick ride at lunch. This is the Art District Stop in downtown Phoenix. Whether you are in search for a delicious food, a new outfit, a unique gift, or looking for a painting, you can find it at Roosevelt Row.  There are many galery exhibits and creative murals in this neighborhood. There are coffee shops, restaurants at this station from Fair Trade Coffee to Fez. This is your stop if you are going to the First Friday Art Walk.  Happens every month, and it's fun!  You can visit the Roosevelt Row website, and download a map.
