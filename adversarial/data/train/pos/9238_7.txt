What can I say. They have reached a new low.\n\nMy wife and I use to go to the Olive Garden every couple of months, for years. The food was always what you would expect and was very consistant ,on the mediocer side ,at best.\n\nWhen we arrived it was an 1 hour wait, which is normal at 6pm on a saturday. no problem, we wait for our table for six.I noticed other large groups that came in after we did getting in before us. I do a quick recon of the hostesses clipboard and sure enough, no less than 5 partys of 6-8 ppl got in ahead of us. Sorry they say....it will be just another 5 minutes.\n\nWe ordered drinks and they did'nt have the advertized special. Mint lime fresco something. No problem, it must have been so good they sold out. We did get the breadsticks( cold and way undercooked)\nThe food ,when it arrived,was obviously sitting under the heat lamp for waaay to long. Everything was dry dry dry.\nOur friends young son order pepperoni pizza. It came with no pepperoni .\nDessert time.  Hmmmm what to have? Nothing of course because its still all frozen!!  ( insert apology here)......ha ha ha , NOT!\n\nThey normally do better. \nThis time , however, they completly failed on so many levels I was embarassed for them.
