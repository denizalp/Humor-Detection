I like Jin Mee because it's an all well rounded Korean restaurant.  Most Korean House specialize in certain type of dishes but not here.  They do all of it well especially their jjajangmyun; Noodles in drenched in black bean sauce with dices of pork lion, zucchini, onions, and potatoes.  The combination of the saltiness and sweet is dangerously good.  After i inhaled all the noodles i usually get down and spooned the remainder of the bowl as if it was my last supper.  Only 6bucks too!\n\nTip: Pull yourself together, mate, and make yourself a bib!
