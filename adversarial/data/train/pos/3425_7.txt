Sake Bombs a must... Packed Friday night out on the patio, and the menu had something for everyone's palate! Portions were pretty big.  Loved my Yamada Roll! Spicy drizzle of sauce over the roll, crab meat was sweet, and I was comfortably full on this soy wrapped roll. Friends enjoyed their steak and potatoes, flatbread pizzas and shrimp appetizers. Staff was attentive for the most part.  In addition to the great food, their ambiance and  our company hosting our visit to AZ really made it so that we enjoyed ourselves!
