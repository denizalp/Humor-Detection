The Buffet at Wynn is in my top 3 'must eat' buffets in Vegas. The selection is not as wide as say, Bacchanal or Carnival World, but the quality of food is definitely top notch.\n\nFOOD\nAhi poke tuna - so soft!\nMinestrone soup - average\nVeal short rib - very delicious and melty\/fatty\nWaffle batter fried chicken - yummy!\nGourmet salads\nMeats - really yummy\nSeafood - not as fresh\nDesserts - visually appealing with attention to details!\n\nAMBIENCE\nFairly bright and open. I love the decor at Wynn because there are flowers everywhere! There are even flowers on the display cakes - which, btw, look amazing.\n\nOVERALL\nI feel like despite the price, ($40 for dinner) this buffet is more worth it. It's cheaper than Bacchanal ($55 for dinner) and you get the same great quality of food. The only downside is that the lines are always long to pay and get seated, but all the popular spots are like that. This is a great buffet to visit if it's your first time in Vegas since it's not the MOST expensive buffet, yet you can still experience the luxurious excessiveness that is Sin City.
