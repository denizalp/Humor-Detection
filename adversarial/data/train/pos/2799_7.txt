Ok. Where to start.  We decided to take 5 friends out for restaurant week and Heirloom was the chosen destination.  None of us had ever eaten there before. The deco is western mixed with southern hippy.  A waitress rolls a small wooden cart around with herbs picked from their parking lot, yeh you heard me right (parking lot herb garden).  I actually saw the sad arrangement as we were walking in and a friend spit his gum in it thinking it was a bunch of dead old flowers.  Needless to say, we didn't partake of their herb-EVOO mixture. She then told us that when they run low, they have employees who bring herbs from their home gardens.  Ummm, okay.  That's not weird, and potentially gross.  How do I know a dog hasn't urinated on my soon-to-be herb mix?!   Then the waiter comes over to tell us all the minutia about the food that we may or may eat...... We order.  The food took a LONG time to come out.  It was just okay.  Nothing I'd ever have again, on purpose.  The dessert was French press coffee for me. The waiter tells me all about the mountain company in NODA they purchase the beans from \"we pay 10% more to them on purpose\" as if that would make me enjoy the coffee more.  When he brought it over, he pressed so hard on the ancient French press that he spilled it all over the table (which may I add is covered in white paper from a roll as if we were going to color on the table).  Each time the waiter came to our table, he would run his hand across the nearest person's back and shoulders very in appropriately.  I didn't come for a massage, I came for food.  After the coffee experience, he then tells our table about a new restaurant HE is part owner of called \"Little Spoon,\" which if I was the owner of Heirloom, I would fire him on the spot for trying to steal business.  Anyway, it was nothing short of a circus that was more of a show than a restaurant. Lesson learned!  Sushi next time!!
