I don't care what anyone says, this is my spot right here! Is it old by Vegas standards....yup. Is it kinda on the lamer side of the strip....yup. I don't really mind though. With Riviera you get clean rooms and a super laid back casino. I've been in love with that for some years now. You can go to the casino and play whatever you want. No huge crowds walking in and out of the casino. I am actually one of those people who never minded the walk from Riviera to the center strip. I kinda like it to be honest. Rooms are really comfortable if you get the newer type rooms. Flat screen tvs, comfy beds, super quiet hallways with cheap soda machines....my type of Vegas right here. I think most of you didn't research Vegas enough before you went. You thought you could pay 200 bucks for 5 nights and magically get a bellagio type room....Nope Jokes on you. Riviera is just a nice spot to sleep and shower in. This is Vegas so why do you need to be in your room all day anyway. I will never understand some of you. \n\nI do hate the Riviera food court these days. There is a quiznos and then some crappy spots to eat at. You are better off just walking across the street to slots of fun or circus circus. Riviera gets the job done if you are like me and out and about most of the day and just need a place to sleep for 5-8 hours. \n\nI really hope they don't ever close this place...would make me so sad. So many memories here. I made the promise to myself that I will always come over to Riviera whether I'm staying there or not! Long live the Riv
