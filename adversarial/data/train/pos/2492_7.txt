Went here a couple weeks ago but forgot to review. It was that night that it randomly started snowing after 60 degree weather all week. It made it seem more cozy.\n\nIt was kinda late (almost 10), but the kitchen was still going strong, and unfortunately we had quite a long wait. Normally, I'd just down a couple beers to take the edge off..but since I can't drink right now, I just got cranky.  My friends also got a bit annoyed that so many of their choices were tapped, but I guess we got there a bit too late.\n\nDespite the fact that I couldn't try any beers, I was very pleasantly surprised at the quality of the food here! I had hummus, which was creamy and plentiful, and the grilled pita was perfect. The cobb salad was just ok, but the other appetizers were insanely good, like the baked beans and the fried andouille sausage. Um, and fried pickles? A pregnant gal's dream.\n\nI would definitely recommend this place for beer lovers and unhealthy foodies alike.
