Was not impressed with this automotive shop and the quality of work performed on our vehicle.  We were referred to 'Goldie' by a family member who uses him.\nThe brakes were replaced and not even a yr later were squeaking.  They were under warranty for a yr and we had to go back and haggle with 'Goldie' to fix the squeak.  We were not happy with other repairs to the vehicle as well.\nThe guy is a crook!
