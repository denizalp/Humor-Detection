First off, this place is white castle and is definitely not in the same leagues as bachi or even in n out for that matter.  Essentially the competitors to this restaurant are establishments like mcdonalds and wendys but I would much rather eat there than here.\n\n1. OVERPRICED! you get the 6 slider meal and i think it comes out to $12? WTF go to glaziers and get the 6 cheese for $4 guys.\n\n2. It tastes exactly like the kinds you buy frozen.  There literally was no difference at all in terms of taste.\n\n3. Don't plan to go to hot yoga after because you will get bad gas. seriously... big mistake\n\nOverall: It's really overpriced and the taste is comparable to the ones you can buy frozen but I will say that they do not taste all that bad.
