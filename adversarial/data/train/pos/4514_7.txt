Did you ever go into a business where you automatically know you are going to have a bad experience.  A place where just by looking that the employees you later think to yourself that you should have just turned around and walked out?  Yeah?  Me too.\n\nI stopped here late one night because of my work schedule and it is basically one of the only places open after midnight in this area of the city.  I walked in because I was parched and the one thing that hit me right away was the odor.  It smelt like the bathrooms were overflowing and unclean for hours.  Unfortunately for me, I had to use the facilities.  Holding your breath while doing your business is not an easy thing to do.\n\nAfter that excursion, I stopped for a beverage and headed to the register.  It's a bit disturbing when you show up to the register and the employee behind it is so bored out of their mind that they are on their phone while the other is staring out the windows.\n\nBest to stop here for just gas and use the pumps to pay.
