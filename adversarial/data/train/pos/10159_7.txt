Had lunch here today with fellow yelpers Robyn N. and Rand H. Well to start the place was built in an old Claim Jumper location and all the booths and decor were used again,it is very nice and comfy. The food was really good  they offer a couple of unusual dishes not seen at other Chinese buffets and a good dessert selection. The food here is displayed nicer then any other Asian buffet I have been at. But I still like a couple of the big super buffets better.This place is probably in the top 5 Asian buffets.
