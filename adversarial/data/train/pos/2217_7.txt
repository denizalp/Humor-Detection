OK, I love UGG's in general, own 4 pairs of boots, clogs, slippers, etc.  So when I went into this store, I was fully prepared to buy something, but, wait a minute.  The saleswoman was very RUDE, I was browsing the store, found a pair of shoes for my sweetie, told her I was going to get my husband outside, would be right back.  Guess what she said, \"Oh, is he the money maker???  I said NO, just wanted him to try on some shoes... I was speechless that she would say such a tacky thing in the year 2011, really...  I will never shop at this store, and hope if the management ever reads this review they will give a sensitivity training seminar to their staff.  I was in the store on Sunday, Feb. 20th around 3PM, and did not return. Sad that this attitude still exists in our modern world.
