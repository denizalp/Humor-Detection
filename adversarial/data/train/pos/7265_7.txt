Decided to switch up my regular spot for a while and give Jimmy and his retro decorated barbershop a few tries. I love the old school vibe, tv and machines and cool car-barber chair for the kiddos needing a chop. While I thought he did a decent job on my haircut I doubt I'll be back. I asked for a razor skin fade twice on two separate occasions and Jimmy still left some hair where there shouldn't have been. Ah well it seems like he's doing a bang up job with the other fellows on here so I'm not worried about him losing one guy. In the meantime I'll still continue to go to my regular spot in Hendertucky. 3 stars solid
