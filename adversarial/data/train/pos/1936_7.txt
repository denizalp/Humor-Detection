What a fun candy shop to visit!  I was out and about in the strip district with my amazing niece and nephew -- stopped in and they couldn't get over the wall of specialty pop (root beer etc.)  Running special - buy 5 and get 1 free..  they were in heaven choosing!!   Theres so many cute novelty items and fun little trinkets.  The candyshop was packed but worth the trip . . there was so much that we didnt see..I wanna go back very soon.  I had my eye on a star wars lunchbox .. and almost got it!! I chose a hula girl (dancing) for my car dashboard instead  - Ha Ha .. we named her wii-kiki
