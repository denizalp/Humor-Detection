The anticipation was killing me. This place seriously looked open since September or October, but only now has it's doors opened. I went as soon as I could. But have you ever build up something so much in your mind that once it finally happens it just kind of falls flat? Well, that's what I got with Choolaah. I was guessing it would be more Chipotle style, but instead think Panera. Here is what I was able to try: Paneer Tikka Masala Bowl, Veggie Biryani, Lamb Meatball BBQ Plate, Samosa Chaat, Traditional and Wheat Naan, Chickpea Masala, Choolaah Chai, and Mango Lassi. PHEW! Big list, right?\n\nEverything here was just okay. There is definitely better Indian food to be had, but not for this price. So, I can see why people are going coo-coo for Choolaah, but not me. It has great promise if it... 1) increased portion sizes to be more on par with prices. 2) Made the paneer less crumbly sponge-y, and more soft sponge-y. Think hard versus soft tofu texture difference. 3) Provided more sauce on the bowls. The rice to sauce balance in the bowls was way off. 4) Included veggies in certain dishes, e.g. the Tikka Masala bowl. And lastly, 5) stopped making their chai tea so watery. \n\nI would drink the Mango Lassi again, but it was a minuscule cup for the price. I think I should have tried the Kulfi. But one or two items are not really worth returning to this restaurant. The building itself and inside decor were great though. Food presentation and time prep were on point as well. I'll give them that!
