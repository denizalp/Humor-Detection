So I've never been to the Pink's in LA.  I'm not a big fan of hot dogs, so waiting in line for an hour + does not sound enticing at all.\n\nNo lines at the one in Vegas!  That and not wanting to eat two hours at a buffet led us to Pink's.  Located right next to the Miracle Mile @ Planet Hollywood, this place only has outdoor seating, under giant umbrellas.  It would have been nicer if it wasn't 100+ degrees that day, but I digress.\n\n$17.30 gets you a spicy mojave and a planet hollywood (http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/uQB9kS7LzEsGhLTMUUnmEA?select=ku-M_3hoD0dxaTy6-8yQnQ).  Warning, the spicy mojave is not for the weak.  Those jalapenos can kick your taste buds in the butt!
