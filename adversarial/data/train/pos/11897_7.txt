Wow. I love their donuts. \n\nUnlike other location, their donuts are not premade. They make it as you order it. It is rich, thick, and absolutely delicious. It is a bit too sweet for my taste bugs..but it surely was delicious. I had a plain, snore and banana cream donuts. I like the plain one the most. The other two are too sweet but still delicious. \n\nThe store is very clean, organized and staffs are very friendly. If I am in the general area, I don't mind stopping by here again.
