My best friend and I are here a couple of times a month for breakfast. The service is generally pretty good and the food is cheap and decent. Today, there was a hair in my food. The owner tried to argue with me and tell me it was a string from the egg, but it was elastic and thicker than a string for the egg would be. \nThe waitress took off the meal from my check. I was waiting for my friend to be done and she came back, super embarrassed, because the owner told her she had to charge me for the toast. \nLol, won't be back. Not at all how you should handle customer service.
