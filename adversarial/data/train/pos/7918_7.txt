Dude what the heck? This place is a mess and everything is over priced. I saw a humidifier for $178 and I bought the exact same model a few months ago from Amazon for $89.  There's stuff all over the floors that you literally have to step over to walk down the aisles. If the deals were crazy good, I would totally look past the mess. But obviously they are not real bargains.
