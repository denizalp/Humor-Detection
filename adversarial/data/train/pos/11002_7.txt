A fun casino downtown! \nI really enjoyed Binion's. This place is so old, vintage and historic. Mr. Binion himself was shot in one of the rooms here. It's got some history here. \nThey have as stack of dollar bills that supposedly make up a million dollars. You know, a million in hundreds easily fits in a suitcase, so they're stacking some singles in there too to make the stacks look bigger. You can get a free photo of yourself grinning in front of it. It takes about thirty minutes for the printout. \nOnce you join up with their gamblers club, they give you one free spin on the computer slots, or something. They have a lot of other offers where if you're a consistent gambler, you get lots of perks and comps. \nThey offered Jacks or Better poker with good paying odds on cheaper machines. \nThe minimums here were mainly $10 with plenty of $5 tables. The craps were hot, and the drinks kept coming. \nI'd recommend coming here when doing the Fremont Experience, which runs right in front of the place.
