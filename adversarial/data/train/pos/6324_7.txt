The String Bean in Belmont never disappoints. I love that their menu offers a variety of foods that are unique and fresh. I ordered the chicken salad croissant with a side of pasta salad, both of which were delicious. The chicken salad had great flavor - it had nuts, grapes, and celery to compliment the chicken. The chicken salad itself wasn't too wet or too dry, it was just right. The flakey, buttery croissant was so yummy. Their pasta salad is a balsamic-based pasta salad, and it was awesome.\n\nThe atmosphere in the String Bean is kind of like classy rustic, if you can imagine that. We had excellent service. Our server checked in regularly to refill drinks, find out if we needed anything, and he was so friendly.\n\nThey have an awesome beer and wine selection. I will definitely be back to the String Bean. It's worth the drive from Charlotte, for sure!
