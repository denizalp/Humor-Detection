After play a few games Vil and I decided to venture to see the Bellagio Gardens. I didn't know they change the scenery every season. It is so beautiful in there and fun. To see all the different colors and the flowers look so perfect that you think they are not real. Will be back next time in Vegas to check out what new scenery concept.
