Something is ABSOLUTELY wrong with most of you reviewers.( Or PH Towers is reading these reviews and making the necessary changes) Anywho, I had ZERO problems at PH Towers...I don't know where yall were staying but it wasn't here! I mean REALLY who the hell stays in there room in Vegas. Who cares if the TV isn't working;get over yourself.\n\nPositives: \n+ There was one person ahead of us at check-in so check in was quick and painless. ( We arrived about 5pm on a Thursday)\n\n+ Room was the bomb.com! We got a Jr. Suite and upgraded to a bigger suite for $20 extra a night. \n\n+ We were halfway down the hall from the elevator. And the hall wasn't hella cold like it is in the MGM which I liked :) The room, OH THE ROOM! It was great! Enough room for 3 girls and probably could had had another 1 or 2 friends with us and still had room.\n\n+ Everything in room was beyond clean! No dust, no shit from other people. Everything worked fine.\n\n+ Called housekeeping and bell man to bring things up once in room, wait was no more than 10 minutes IF even that!\n\n+ Walk to the  Casino floor was easily 5 minutes. We passed up Fat Tuesdays so that was great!\n\n+ Went to the pool at 6pm two days in a row and it was nice. Not too many ppl, playing cool music. Still hot as hell! lol!! But definitely better than during the day.\n\n+ Ordered room service twice, was really quick, probably took 20 minutes from time of order to time we rec'd food.\n\n+ Check out was easy! Checked out on the tv..so don't know how check out is. (We left Monday also so that might make a difference in check out times)\n\nOnly negatives:\n\n- That security guard was annoying at the elevators...except for that cutie lol. I understand you want to make sure none of the riff raff gets into the elevators but always having to dig in my purse to get the key got annoying. I'd always forget until we got right up there...I was just tryna get up to the room! Geeze lol!\n\n- Taxis weren't plentiful.\n\nOverall, I'd stay there again!! Everything was great; room,staff,crowd etc.
