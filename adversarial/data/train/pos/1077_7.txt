I live near this Fuel and have eaten here on many occasions. The mediocre pizza isn't my complaint (today). It's the terrible incident last night. I ordered a medium pizza for delivery. \n\n20 minutes after scheduled delivery I call them to check up. I'm put on hold for a few minutes. Then transferred to a \"manager\". He tells me they ran out of pepperoni, so they couldn't make my pizza. He pauses and adds, \"I guess we should have called you.\" Yeah. I guess I should have called someone else. No more fuel for me.
