So, was sitting around on a Monday night at 6pm and was bored, a thought popped into my mind, I need Shrimp Taquitos! I needed to go to my favorite restaurant! Called my sister, and we met up at 730pm!\n\nHands Down this is still my favorite restaurant! I know, I always order the same thing, but its so good, I cant help myself. I dream of Shrimp Taquitos! Best ever!\n\nThe only thing I was 'sad' about was the Habenero salsa has changed. I loved it the way it was before, it was my favorite salsa ever! But it has a different texture now.  I know things change, but I wish for the original to come back! \n\nRecommend? Hell yes! I have ten check ins here and I plan to keep adding to that number.\n\nOh yea...25% off your bill on Mondays, for locals only(meaning, must have a NV ID)
