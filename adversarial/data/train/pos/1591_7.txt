If you've been to the buffet back when it was the Sahara you'd remember the little journey you had to take just to get to the buffet. Well the SLS buffet doesn't have that kind of journey as before but still it's a some what a walk from the main casino. Maybe it's not such a bad thing. \n\nThe hours and days are weird for a Vegas buffet. They only do brunch and dinner Fri, Sat, and Sunday. The prices are decent especially if you have a Nevada ID and sign up for the CODE card, 2 for 1 prices.\n\nThe interior is nice very nice. The selection and presentation of the food are also nice however some of the food seemed like it was sitting out for awhile. The plates are small. \n\nThe crepe station was nice except it was poorly made. The fresh made waffles were nice except the guy making them didn't know how to use the waffle maker, it was funny watching him break the machine and see the batter spill out. The fresh made donuts were also nice but when it's slow, which it was, seemed like they made to much and when I wanted them they were cold and hard. Liked the seafood selection there were oysters, shrimp, crab, various salmons, sushi, etc. They had dim sum served in individual steamers. The meats weren't the greatest but they had a good selection prime rib, ribs, chicken, etc. During brunch they have fresh made to order omelets.\n\nThe leg room on the tables are bad. You might whack your knees.\n\nGood customer service, very friendly and quick at bringing drinks out.\n\nIn a city of buffets they're not the best for the value but decent with the 2 for 1 price.
