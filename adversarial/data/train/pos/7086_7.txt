Taco salad includes guacamole, which is awesome. It comes in a fried tortilla bowl. The salad was unique from other taco salads because it was pretty much 33% lettuce, 33% rice, 33% beans. Personally, I prefer more lettuce than the rice. The chicken was a little disappointing- pretty bland\/one-dimensional (salt). The tomato vinaigrette that came with it had only a small hint of heat, but the taco salad itself had enough salt that I didn't have to use it.\n\nThe Guacamole + chips is $8, which I thought was pretty steep for the amount of guacamole I got. It was one of those Chipotle guac cups, but literally only 75% full. The chips (presumably fried in lard\/oil) were good. \n\nLunchtime rush is real, and there are quite a few tables. You order at the register, grab a number, and someone delivers your food. You do not have to clean up after yourself either.
