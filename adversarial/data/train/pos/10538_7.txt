I'm updating this to explain after a few times of trying these (and taking all my friends etc hundreds) I don't like them.\n\nThey have to be sweetened with stevia or something because they give me a headache. The kind of headache alternative sugar or sweetener does.\n\nI understand regular white sugar has bone char (not vegan) so I'm really curious to know exactly what they use.
