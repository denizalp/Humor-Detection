Avoid at all costs. I've eaten at Ditkas in Chicago more times than I can count on two hands and two feet. I knew the quality of the meals and service to expect but I don't know where to start about Da Coaches place in his home town. What a disaster. Had a 10 top their Monday night and things couldn't have gone worse. It was Monday and of course the Head Chef and A team were not there and that became apparent once the food showed up. Apps might as well been from Dennys. Cold and rubbery calamari, cold pot roast nachos by the crab cakes were decent.\n\nHere's the deal: The cadence and control of the waitstaff and the kitchen is completely out of sync. Waitstaff, under trained, young and not seasoned. Clearly the practice squad and not the starting lineup.\n\nSoup had a layer of dried Scum on top from sitting under the window too long. Salads were average.\n\nMain course: crappy crusty, flavorless steaks served on \"Cold\" plates?? WTF Mike? Cold plates? I refused to eat my 45 day old filet as it was not 45 day old aged and the outside was burned to a crisp, the inside dry and tasteless while the red interior had zero heat. The Monday chef cooks like a caveman!! I sent back the filet  and ordered a NY Strip instead. It was good but not that good.\n\n\nBottom line: This is not your real Ditkas folks unless this Ditkas was in a hospital commissary where the food is only slightly below average but you don't care as the experience you are going through tending to a sick friend in the hospital overshadows anything you might eat there. \n\nTo quote Da Coach: \"Effort without talent is a depressing situation... but talent without effort is a tragedy. - Mike Ditka\n\nWe could not have said it better! Sorry coach, DItkas in Pittsburgh is a losing team.
