Make an appointment? Forget about it. I waited 25-30 minutes for me and my boyfriend to get a pedicure. I told Mimi the day before that I have a class at 7:30pm and I needed to be out by 7. She recommended me to make an appointment because \"I wouldn't have to wait, it's much better,\" she said. This was my boyfriends first pedicure experience and I didn't want to ruin it for him. We got there at 5:50. At 6:05, I asked Mimi directly, \"how much longer? I have an appointment at 6. And I don't want to be late for my class.\" She remembered me from the day before and apologized and said \"only 7 more minutes.\" So, I sat there some more.... which was a mistake.\nI did not get seated till about 6:25. This was so frustrating to me. I needed to leave in 35 minutes! Now they need to rush what was suppose to be a relaxing pedicure for me and my boyfriend. \nI don't question the skills of the techs there but this business has poor customer service and does not have a good sense of timing. My pedicure was definitely rushed. I walked out of there with wet nail polish and I ended up leave at 7:15, running late to my class! And when I was paying, no one even offered a discount! So, I took it upon myself and asked the lady when she gave me the totaling amount. And the first response was \"we're not the owners. we cannot give discount.\" I explained to her again how I made an appointment at 6 and did not start until 6:25-6:30 and how I'm running late. They knew how upset I was. Then, she asked one of the male workers again and he offered a 5 percent discount. I didn't argue at this point. It wasn't worth it to me. So I paid $62.70 for two rushed pedicures. I'm so disappointed. I feel like I was lied to. I would have appreciated some honesty, or some type of reimbursement, even a store credit. DEFINITELY NOT COMING BACK.
