This review is based on the service in the salon... \n\nHorrible, condescending stylist (who smelled like stinky ciggies) couldn't figure out HOW to cut my kid's messed-up (self-giving) haircut...She insisted it would cost $45!! (for a kid's haircut??!! WTH?) This woman disappeared to get the opinion of a 2nd stylist...who started asking me 'How old is your kid?\", \"when did this happen?\", etc....oh geez! Just cut hair without the interrogation!\n\nWe got up and left.\n\nI will NEVER come to this place ever again! \n\n*ps-Go someplace else if you need giant barrels of shampoo (they're overpriced too)...
