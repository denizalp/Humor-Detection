I was very disappointed.  My wife I tried Fuzzy's based on the reviews and both of us found this pizza to be below par.  Nothing like good Chicago pizza.  We ordered a sausage and mushroom 16\" and I think we got 12 mushrooms and 8 pieces of sausage.  The pizza had lots of cheese but very little flavor.  We won't be back.
