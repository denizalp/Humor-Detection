Omnivores,vegans, pescetarians, vegetarians, lacto-ovo vegetarians, flexivores, carnivores and people who love soup--- they have you covered.\n\nI'm not a vegetarian, but I do try to eat healthily.  That generally means, more veggies, less fat, less meat, more whole grains, more organic food...  Sadly, that often limits lunch choices to grilled chicken salads.\n\nTree Hugger's has lovely, lovely soup, great vegetarian and chicken (with fruit!) salads.  I recently had the black bean chimichanga-- black beans, rice and sweet potato in spices wrapped in a whole wheat tortilla and grilled.  It wasn't meat and it wasn't fried, yet it still managed to taste fantastic!  The chicken salad wrap is delish, but it really does need salt.  (I actually appreciate that, though, because most places over-salt everything.)\n\nFear not the vegan cookie!  Vegan baked goods are usually disgusting.  Sorry guys, but that brownish lump of oats, hemp seeds, coconut and carob is just not appealing.  Tree Huggers has somehow managed to make vegan cookies that are as desirable as plain old cookies!!!  I had a carrot ginger cookie-- think of a light carrot cake with an orange ginger glaze.  It was huge, crumbly, soft and delightfully flavorful.  And it looked like a cookie, not a clod of mud!\n\nDon't wait until you are on some sort of health kick to eat here!
