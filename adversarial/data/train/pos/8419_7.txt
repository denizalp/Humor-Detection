Look, for anyone complaining about the men and women of Phoenix PD, I hope you never find yourself having to deal with Scottsdale PD. I am an extremely fair person, but Scottsdale PD is ridiculous. They will harass you, berate you and treat you like a second class citizen for no reason whatsoever...who knows, maybe they get off on it. And I'm not some criminal a hole either complaining just to hear myself complain. Phoenix PD is different, and I cannot say I have ever been mistreated by any Phoenix police officer I've ever come into contact with while at work or when I was just recently pulled over. The officer treated me like a human being. \n\nSo, 4 stars for Phoenix PD. -46 stars for Scottsdale whose officers treat everyone like rabid dogs.
