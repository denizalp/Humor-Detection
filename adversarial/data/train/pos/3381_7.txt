mediocrity\npizza, sushi, chinese food\nnone of it done well\n\nIn a word, \"avoid\".  Ordered delivery of 2 eggrolls, a \"deluxe\" sushi platter, Tom Yum soup, and a sechuan chicken entree.  \nEggrolls were nothing special, way too much anise and 5 spice.  Tom Yum was positively wretched. The sushi was not for me, but good for cats.  And they do not even use sushi rice for the rolls.  Blech.  Sechuan chicken was a bland gloppy mess.  I'm not going back.  \n\nCarry on.
