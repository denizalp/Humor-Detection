Okay. I KNOW I've already rated and posted. But DEAR GOD. Dear goodness gracious.\n\nThe smoky brown sugar bark on the ribs.\n\nThe glazy dark chewy-crisp skin on the wings.\n\n The ethereal coating on the sweet potato fries.\n\nThe dirty feeling one experiences upon the first bite into a gigantic deep-fried panko-crusted macaroni and cheese ball.  \n\nPure culinary debauchery.
