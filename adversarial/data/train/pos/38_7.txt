It was Alright. A-ok. Decent. Adequate.......the quintessential 3 star experience.\n\nLocated on the north east corner of Windmill Avenue and Eastern, you'll find Jimmy Johns just past the gas station mini-market. \n\nEven though it's a relatively small location, the inside is more spacious than anticipated. there are a few tables and booths available, with another seating section around the corner and in the back.\n\nI think the big thing this place has going for it is price and value. You can purchase an 8\" sub for only $4.95! For $1 more you can get the large sub. Not a bad price point at all for what you get.\n\nI tried the roast beef on this last visit. The sandwich was alright. It was worth it for the price I paid. They seemed to skimp a bit on the meat and there wasn't much in the way of toppings. Add to that, the bread is the \"hard shell\" type. Kind of reminded me a bit of the bread they serve in Cousins subs(a franchise I'm familiar with from living in Phoenix...although Cousins bread was still better imo). \n\nThe employees were okay. They did their job, but service was nothing spectacular either. \n\nLike I said, it was just a middle of the road, 3 star experience. I may come back and give another menu item a shot, but I won't exactly be going way out of my way to do so...\n\n3 stars.
