Ikea is a store I just enjoy wandering around in... forget that they have the cheapest furniture and whatnot around. Forget that they have a million employees who each seem to know everything about the store. Forget that everything comes in little do-it-yourself boxes that I can fit in my wife's Corolla. Forget that despite being mostly made of \"cheap\" wood, all of the things I've purchased have lasted for years. Forget all that. They get four stars because they let me take naps on the couches.
