I had received a Groupon for this company and decided to get the basic cleaning.  the two girls were friendly and did an outstanding job on my home.  i will only give 3 stars bc i too had a customer service issue.  they were scheduled at 2:30 today and at 3 i called and was told \"oh, no one called to tell you they are coming at 4?\". needless to say that are needs improvement, but the service was very good.
