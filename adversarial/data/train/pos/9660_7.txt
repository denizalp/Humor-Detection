Dear Summer,\nPlease return quickly so I can spend my happy hours on the patio of the wine bar enjoying my favorite pinot grigio and possibly some flat bread and sweet potato fries. I will bring all my friends and we will sit for hours (and be shocked when our bill comes with 45 glasses on it). I do enjoy the wine bar in the winter but it really shines in the summer.\nSincerely,\nMaura
