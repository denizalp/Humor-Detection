I have lived in Las Vegas for 9 years and finally made my way over to Frankie's Tiki Room Bar! Thanks to my lovely best friend and fellow Yelper HeatherS. This Tiki bar is a lot of fun, it is dark and intimate with a fun Tiki atmosphere. The drinks are out of this world with skull ratings on strength! I want a powerful punch when I drink alcohol so I went with the 5 star skull ratings in my drink choices. \n\nI had a drink called the \"Fink Bomb\" and a \"Zombie\" both of which packed a yummy punch! There classic drinks are $9 a piece and well worth it because all I needed was two and I was fly for the night! The staff is super welcoming and friendly, I really like the laid back feeling. You can grab a seat at the bar and game while you drink or you can sit in one of their tables and chairs or tiki hut booth in the corner.\n\nThe Tiki Room has a great staff, drinks and atmosphere that is mellow and comfortable. I will be back for sure to enjoy a tasty drink and relax.\n\nFrankie's is Sexy! This cool little spot is loads of fun and you should know that I like it a lot!
