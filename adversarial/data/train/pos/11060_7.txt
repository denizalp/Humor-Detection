I go here 2-3 times\/week because my little old man loves this place (medium sized cocker spaniel).\n\nLocation:\nAMAZING location! a lot of parking and within walking distance to other public parks if you do not want to go to the 'leash free' zones. There are several sections depending on the size of your dog and a general area where most of the people take their pups to. A lot of hills, water areas, benches and plenty of shaded areas when it gets hot.\n\nPeople\/Dogs:\nI took my dog here and originally, I was quite worried because our adopted dog is 50\/50 on if he will behave, or be a complete nightmare. Once he was in, all of the ADORABLE dogs came up to him an started to play! It was such a relief that everyone was incredibly friendly and there were no dogs that caused any trouble.\n\nI would be willing to drive if I knew that my dog would be incredibly comfortable and I am always excited to go there.
