The best gym Scottsdale tax payers can buy!\n\nI decided to forgo my membership to the ASU gym this summer since I was always so creeped out by the matrix-ness of that gym-everybody plugged into their tvs right in front of them, so that when I would take out my ear plugs, all I heard were the whirring sounds of treadmills and silence-deadly quiet. Gave me the chills.\n\nI decided my favorite activity is to ride the Green Belt-and since I do it either early in the morning or after 7:30, why not focus on that this summer? \n\nI take the route from the bridge at Rio Salado (cross at the Marque and enter from the road behind it) and ride it to Scottsdale Civic Center. I have always been impressed by the hills, the characters I see, the water, the grass, I hate watching the golfers just use up so much of our water but then again I like to ride over a huge lake in the desert, so who is more in denial? I have rode as far at Indian School, but not further (probably b\/c I can't think of lunch places or places near enough I could stop by exhausted and smelling and red).\n\nIt can be frustrating when children waddle, or frisbees lurch into your path, or skateboards come from nowhere, or dogs all of sudden run in front of your bike. So please heed Gabi's advice and stay to the right please-and watch all the wee ones and pups that don't know better! I try not to use my annoying bike horn, but its either annoying bike horn or I run over your toddler! I do wish the path was a little wider for this reason.\n\nAlso, if interested in trying out the bike ride with a group of safe riders and getting a bite to eat, you can join the C.R.A.P. riders at 7:30pm every Tuesday night where a group commences to ride the Green Belt to the Orange Table for food and buck off delicious micro-brewed beers. They have been doing it for almost 3 years now!\n\nHere is more info on that ride and others that do the Green Belt: http:\/\/www.biketempe.org\/?page_id=4\n\nHappy Pedaling!
