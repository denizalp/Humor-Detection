I was so surprised that we had the experience we did. The place was cute, the service was terrific but it was the food we were so disappointed with...  I started with fried green tomatoes. I didn't even taste tomato. Husband had fried calamari. It was mostly breading with very little actual calamari. The sauce served with it was a paprika bomb that, for us, did not go with the calamari at all. they didn't even serve lemon with it.\nHusband had pork which was good. I had the steak which was a bit chewy at medium. The desserts were not to our liking as well.  The cheesecake was odd in flavor with a super thick crust that I don't think served it well.  The chocolate desert was almost a pudding, but I am pretty sure it was supposed to be cake.  For so much money and a long drive at that, I am pretty sure we are not going back.
