I've grown to love cooking over the past few years, and with that comes a taste and appreciation for quality cookware and kitchen must-haves.  Until about a year ago I only knew of Orange Tree Imports on Monroe Street for locally-owned shop, until I stumbled upon the Kitchen Gallery online when searching for a Le Creuset vendor.  I am officially in love with this store!  The staff are so extremely helpful and education on every product I've asked about...not to mention they always seem to have just the item I'm looking for.  I was recently on the hunt for a specific Peugeot pepper mill, of which they make many, and stopped in last weekend to find two of the exact ones on the shelf...score!  They will also have great specials on All Clad pieces...I think all they're missing is cooking classes!  Love this place!
