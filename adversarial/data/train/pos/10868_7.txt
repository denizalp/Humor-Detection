***FREE covered parking for 3hrs***\n\nWhy would I come here?:  Marshalls, maybe No Frills (if you live nearby), Walmart, Dollarama, or Winners.  That's basically it.\n\nHas potential, but something about this \"mall\" oozes ghetto.  I think it's the lack of natural light, crowded and narrow walkways, low ceilings, & of course, the crowd.\n\nThis isn't very obvious at Marshalls, but as you access the rest of mall, it's quite obvious.  I visited on a fairly warm Saturday afternoon and the halls were literally heated with body heat.  No AC\/ventilation whatsoever.\n\nFood court is still undergoing some renos as the floors were all torn up.\n\nNothing to see here, folks.  Move along...
