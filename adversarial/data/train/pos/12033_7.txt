This is your typical pile of garbage Thrift Shop. The real horror however is with the people working there. To get one of them to open another cash register requires Biblical Intervention.\nCheckout lines can take 15 minutes with TWO people waiting. If the line grows to 7 or 8 the lone cashier attempts to summon help. After a good 10 minutes some slug shows-up and begins their register sign-in routine, another 5 minutes.\n\nIf you have time to blow this store is terrific as a time waster. Otherwise keep driving past this silly store.
