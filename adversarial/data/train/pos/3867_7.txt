I love curry zen! So simple, yet so good. I come to dine in a few times but I order out quite a bit. When my siblings and I are trying to decide what to eat that day,  at least one of any of the four of us will suggest curry zen! \n\nThe dining space is small and casual but you'll see groups of friends hanging out, couples on a small date,  or business men having dinner with their colleagues. Both tourists and locals. Maybe all at the same time! The servers will work hard for you regardless of how busy it will get. Nice and polite wait staff! \n\nThe food overall is amazing. Each time I dine in, I might get a different side.  My usual plate consists is chicken katsu choosing spice level 1-4,  depending on what I feel like having. The sides I have tried so far are takoyaki, curry pan, and spinach. All delicious,  but I gotta say my fave is the spinach.
