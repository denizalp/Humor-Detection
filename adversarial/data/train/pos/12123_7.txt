I just got a letter in the mail telling me that Moutainside is changing the terms of our contract and is now going to start charge me a \"annual enhancement fee of $25 for your individual plan\".  So lemme get this straight.. I'm being penalized for being single?  Yeah, there's this guy named Uncle Sam who already screws me over for being single and having a good job...I don't need my gym doing that too.  Especially when there is Abby Bella Dance Studio an LA Fitness and 24 Hour Fitness close by (I'll give you their addresses if you're interested in not being taken advantage of).  Seriously..the Audacity and what's an enhancement fee anyway?  Unless liposuction is now included in my membership, I'm taking my business elsewhere.\n***Update:\nMountainside management's definition of an \"enhancement fee\" is a joke.  I'm going to file that explanation under NOT MY PROBLEM.  What you consider \"enhancements\" that you want to charge me a surplus for (without my consent) most of the general public would consider operation costs and keeping up with competition.  This isn't a condo association.  I don't have any invested stake or profit sharing with this company and therefore Mountainside shouldn't be allowed to charge what I would consider to be a B*S* special assessment.  Further stating this fee is an \"industry standard\" is a farce.  In the past I have been a member at: 24hr Fitness, LA Fitness, XSport, Abby Bella and Bally's...NONE of these gyms have ever tried to sneak in some annual \"enhancement fee\" ever.. so who are you comparing yourself too?  Lastly, since I've been bashing you all over town I just found out my co-worker who also has a membership at your club isn't getting charged this annual enhancement fee...how fair is that?
