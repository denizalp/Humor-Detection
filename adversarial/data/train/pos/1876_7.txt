I had late lunch here on a weekday, so it wasn't too busy and it was easy to get things right.  But, boy oh boy did they ever get it right!\n\nThe lunch menu is simple, a few soups, salads, sandhiches, quiche, etc.  But everything was great.  Three of us each ordered different dishes, and sampled each others, and all were rock n roll good!   The quiche lorraine was top notch, the croque monsiuer was great, the salads were crisp and fresh with interesting house-made dressings.  Nothing that we ate was less than superb.\n\nThe service was great:  friendly without being intrusive, and very prompt.  I was taking my mom and grandmother out for lunch, and the server was very patient with my Nana:  old people ask a lot of questions and take a long time to decide what to eat, and it really bothers me that so many servers act put out by this.  Thankfully the gent who served us was patient and polite with the old dear:)  After our meal we sat on the patio chatting for a while, and the gent kep filling our water glasses a few times after we'd already paid our bill.  I liked that.\n\nI live quite far from this part of the city, but I was so impressed by what I saw at lunch that I will definitely be back for a dinner.
