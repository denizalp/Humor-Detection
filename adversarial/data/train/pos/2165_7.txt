I guess I like fake Chinese food because I did not love this place. Was pretty empty when we arrived. Servers were friendly, and place looked clean. For our food we had the crispy chicken, fried rice and salt and pepper shrimp. The chicken was not good, super dry and had a very strong smell to it. Fried rice was okay, nothing special. Now the highlight of our meal was the salt and pepper shrimp, super delicious. I don't know if I'll be back, but from all the good reviews I guess everyone had better luck than me.
