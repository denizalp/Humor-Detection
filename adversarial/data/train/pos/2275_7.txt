Step aside 5 guys!\n \nWoody's you are smoking wood burning hot!\n\nWoody's your burgers are so deliciously juicy and cooked just pink inside!\n\nWoody's you made me into such a cheap date! your Beef Classic would have satisfy me with your generous choices of free toppings and 1\/2 price Mojitos!\n\nWoody's you even have a Patio!! \n\nHey! Can someone stop that humming of \"Who Says\" !Ask him to shut up and eat his Coronary Burger! Why is he NOT watching CP24, it was showing inside Woody's!
