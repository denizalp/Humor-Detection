About the Manager assistant lied about the discount . \nFirst at all, we didn't ask any discount. He is the one who offer 50% . And when the birthday boy got the check it's only shows 20%. I really wanna know how dare he lied to a birthday boy which is only 19 years old! This is not about training system , this is about their personality. Really disappointing of Gen group also really disappointing of UNLV. Cuz the person who lied is graduated from UNLV. Really wanna know with his personality how does UNLV let him graduated.\nSecond , I checked all the reviews. Pretty much there have a lot ppl had same experiences. Why Gen group they never improve ? Looks like they even don't care about what we wrote. I know Gen is only open a month . So what? If u guys not ready for open a business like this. Then finish the training . Don't open when you are not ready. \nThird, just wanna let everybody know I went to Gen in LA before. the service and food quality r better than Gen Las Vegas . Much better. At least Gen @ LA they didn't lied about discount.
