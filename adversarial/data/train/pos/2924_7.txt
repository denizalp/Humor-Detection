I love public transit and I hate the TTC. The TTC is the worst public transit system I have experienced anywhere in the world. In the past year I have used transit in Montreal, New York, Los Angeles, Paris, London, Frankfurt, Rome, Athens, Mexico City... I'm probably forgetting a few but you get the point. \n\nI won't get into how filthy and unreliable the entire system is for the sake of ranting about my biggest pet peeve. Streetcars. They clog the city and should have been buried many years ago. (Not to mention the havoc their slippery tracks wreak on cyclists) If the city can't afford to burry them, at least give them dedicated lanes like on Spadina. \n\nThe $3 fare is too expensive, tokens should be sold at many more outlets throughout the city and the Metropass is a joke. It's only worthwhile if you're taking the TTC twice a day, 5 days a week. If you're skipping even one day it's cheaper to use tokens all month. The whole point of a monthly pass should be to save people money and entice them to use transit more often. \n\nI would rather walk 30min in the middle of winter (and often do) than give the TTC three of my hard earned dollars.
