Ok.. so that bus wasn't as bad as I thought it would be. My boyfriend and I got a bus ticket to take to Fremont because a taxi would've been around $30 each way. \nThere were a lot of tourists on the bus which made me feel a lot safer but coming back to the strip there were a few sketchy people and I will most likely just take a taxi next time so I feel more comfortable. \n\nAnother thing that made me feel a bit nervous was that they wait for awhile at stops to pack as many people as they can onto The Deuce. This results in many people standing and it gets very congested. \nThere were also many interesting smells and I hope that I will never smell those smells ever again!! \nRegardless of the potent smells and many people, it isn't THAT bad. They do keep it as clean as they possibly can and every time we were on it the AC was fully blasted.\nIf you have kids with you, I would only recommend taking the bus up and down the strip not all the way to Fremont st. \nThe experience was memorable and I am glad I tried it once!
