Pour some sugar (distillary) on me.\n\nI wish I could call this place a hidden gem, but really it's in an enormous incubator space run by Common Wealth Development that's home to about 15 different businesses including a photographer, a personal trainer and a small batch nut butter maker. Nuts, right? \n\nI'll keep this short, because really it's quite simple and you should stop reading and go there. NOW. First things first, it's not a bar. It's a distillary. This means limited hours and limited spirits. Let me repeat... it's not a bar. Don't go thinking you're going to be presented with an extensive menu of specialty cocktails great for guzzling. They have a few, but think of this place like a tasting room. Because it is. Their website has a pretty comprehensive explanation of their standards, their specialty limited editions spirits and the local ingredients they use, so eye that over first. \n\nSome new friends (Hey Tom and Ryan) get me out for National Rum Day when these guys were doing $4 standards. Again keep an eye on their webpage and follow them on Facebook because they're updating both with useful information about specials and events. Inside and out, the place is super rad. It's industrial and dark and there's a tremendous amount of seating now on the sidewalk where I instantly felt cooler sitting. Staff is informative about their sippers, hip to Yelp (big ups) and up for some good chit chat if that's your thing. \n\nReserve a Thursday, Friday or Saturday to check it out (the only days they're open) and ask for a taste before you grab a glass of something. They're free, they come with info and insight and your cool factor grows exponentially as you sit.
