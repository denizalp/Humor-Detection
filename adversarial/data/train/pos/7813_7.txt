I love me some late night eats at Hanny's. I frequent here often because it is located in the heart of downtown Phoenix and opens pretty late. The restaurant itself is housed in an old International style building (built in the 40's) that used to be a department store. I love ambiance of the bar area and it even has a meat slicer present to slice up some thin slices of prosciutto. Some of my favorites are the Porchetta, Giardiniera & Rossa Bianco pizzas. Check out Sunday nights for $10 pizza nights and drink specials. Make sure you check out the basement area and get a look at the creepy dolls on display.
