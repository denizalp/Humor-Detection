Yeah, I could eat breakfast every day here! I love breakfast foods and this place knocked it outta the park for me on multiple visits. \n\nThings I've tried:\n\n*Bananas Foster French Toast: thick slices of french toast with banana caramelly goodness all over them. ((MY FAVORITE!))\n\n*Waffles: the batter is fantastic, the strawberries were fresh and the whip cream topped it perfectly. (no syrup needed for these delicious waffles!)\n\n*The Pear: this is an omelet with bosc pear, havarti cheese, almond slices and bacon. (You may be thinking, as I did.....pear, eggs and cheese? Don't miss out on this combo, it's outstanding!)\n\nThey do offer GF options too if you need\/prefer. I have yet to try their lunch items because of all the breakfast options. I hear that the Smokehouse Avocado Stack is a must try item! No doubt, I will be back in very soon. Prices are great, happy employee's but the service is a little slow. I attribute the slow service to the fact every time I am in this restaurant it is crazy busy, so just be prepared to wait a little bit. You won't be disappointed once you have your meal though, I think it is worth the wait!
