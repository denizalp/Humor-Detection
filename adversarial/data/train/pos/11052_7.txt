I love to see all of these new BBQ spots popping up in Henderson. It's also great that all of these places are local businesses! Vegas was seriously lacking in local business when I moved here and this area is definitely changing for the better in that regard. \n\nEver since living in Texas I have had a love of BBQ, especially Texas style. As soon as I saw the \"Coming Soon\" sign I knew I'd be coming in to give this spot a try. Last night I finally made it in for a to go order after an appointment I had in the area.\n\nThis restaurant is huge! I loved the d√©cor with the picnic tables and little touches that make it feel like a Texas BBQ spot. As soon as you walk in you head left and down the hall to the start of the counter. They are definitely prepared for crowds. By the time I walked up to the counter someone was already waiting to take my order. The menu options are on a large board over the counter as well as a smaller version in front of your face while ordering. I appreciated the up close version of the menu since I always forget to bring my glasses. \n\nThe staff was very friendly and giving full attention to their customers. I definitely felt like they care about their business and their customers. My to go order came up in a timely manner with attention to making sure I had my preferred sauce and utensils if I needed them. \n\nSince I'm on a diet (womp, womp) I ordered a three meat plate (comes with two sides) plus an additional small side for my husband and I to split. I opted for the half a rack of baby back ribs as one of my meats for a $4 upcharge. This order was definitely enough for two people to share.\n\nMeats:\nCheddar Jalapeno Sausage Links- juicy, cheesy, and hot. I loved these.\nBrisket-moist with a satisfying smoky flavor\nBaby Back Ribs- moist with a great smoky flavor\n\nSides:\nCreamed Corn- my favorite of the sides, great flavor \nBaked Beans- loved that there were bits of veggie in here and the sauce was tasty\nPotato Salad- loved that it had egg and veggie mixed in, I enjoyed this, but be aware that this isn't a mayo loaded creamy potato salad\n\nSauce:\nI was given the option for sweet or spicy and chose sweet more for my husband. The sweet was good, but not my favorite BBQ sauce ever. Next time I'll definitely try the spicy sauce. \n\nMy first visit left a good enough impression for me to return. This is definitely a solid option for the area.
