Lots of beers on tap here. Depending on the season, the beer selection will be varied, unusual and will delight your palate.\nWhen I was there, there were 30 beers available on tap (well, actually only 29 as I don't count cider as beer). If you enjoy IPA's, you will have a large selection from which to choose. If you want a chocolate stout, you may have to settle for a choice of only one, but it will probably be excellent.\nThey have a fairly short food menu but it will probably satisfy your craving for munchies and it will help soak up some of the beer you will have drunk.\nThere is a small parking lot, but there are also a lot of cars parked for other businesses in the area so you may not find a space close to the entrance.\nPrices for the beers are a little on the high side. However, if you choose to sample their beers at home, you can make up your own six-pack from the bottled beers they have for sale.\nWhen I entered the establishment, I felt like I was entering a bar that focused on craft beer but that also served food. It was not a restaurant that focused on food and happened to serve a few good draft beers.
