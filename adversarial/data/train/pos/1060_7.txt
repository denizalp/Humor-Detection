I don't like buffets.  There... I said it.  Long lines. Mediocre food.  IKEA tables.  So why review Bacchanal?  Because I can do what I want.  This is America, pal.  I also visited several buffets while on a recent trip, so... I'll give you my worthless feedback.\n\nI tried the lunch buffet at Caesars, Cosmo, Aria, and M Resort.  Bacchanal is the only buffet I've ever enjoyed.  The line moved quickly.  The food was fantastic (the brisket was the highlight).  The decor was decent... for a buffet.  Would I go back?  Yes.
