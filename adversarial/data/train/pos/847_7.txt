It's never a good sign when 27 seconds into walking somewhere, you feel as if you've made a horrible mistake... That you're about to witness an example of what  Ignatius J. Reilly would describe as  the contemporary world's lack of \"theology and geometry.\"\n\nI went to the Dominion Square Tavern about a week ago to meet Joanne. I thought it was a bar. But it's not. It's a sort of restaurant. But with a bar. But fancy. There's also a sign at the front that says you have to wait to be seated. So I waited. I wanted to sit at a table, but apparently you can only sit at a table if you're eating. So I had to sit at the bar and felt self-conscious the whole time that people could see my buttcrack...\n\nAnd that's the trouble with this whole thing, really. Because this is the kind of place where I go and I think that the problem, really, is me. Because as I sat there with Joanne, getting progressively drunker on blah-ish expensive drinks, eating so-so fries, developing that sinking imposter-syndrome feeling, the place kept filling up with people for whom this was all Just Fine - a good time on the town: sitting there without really experiencing any sort of discomfort at the faux-nostalgia of the whole thing, feeling ok with listening to hours upon hours of contrived acoustic string-band music.
