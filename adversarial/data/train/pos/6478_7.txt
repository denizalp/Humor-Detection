I felt like I was walking through Brooklyn when I came upon this section of St Laurent.  Usually, I get really turned off by the hipster scene, but Lawrence is just so damn.....cool.  You can't deny it, they're cooler than you are and you're lucky to be the little brother they allow to tag along.\n\nThe food is perfect.  The service is exceptional.  The menu is ahead of the curve.  \n\nLawrence is a must when visiting Montreal.
