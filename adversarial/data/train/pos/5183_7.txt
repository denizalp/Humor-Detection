I'm not giving this place five stars because of the food.  This is Dominos and it is what it is.  But when every other place in Boulder City shuts down at 8:00 (which blows my mind) sometimes you're stuck with Dominos.  And as far as Dominos goes, this is the best one I've ever dealt with.\n\nTonight I ordered and my standard Dominos fare was delivered in under 20 minutes from order submission to ingesting the food I immediately regretted...as I would any pizza. \n\n\nDelivery kid was super nice.  I had some coupon.  You're nuts to order from any of these places without a coupon.
