Just an update since they moved a couple of years ago.  Still the best Italian Sausage in the Burgh!  Best Italian Sausage in the Burgh!  Great to use for sandwiches, spaghetti or grilling.  They also have sandwiches (sausage, meatballs) to eat in or take out.  Of course I had to get a sandwich to go since it was lunch time, my Stuffed Banana Peppers sandwich was out of the world.  Sausage is not greasy with natural casings.  Bought a 5 lb ring to cook for our BBQ this week.  \nYou may have seen Ernie Ricci on Cooking with Chris Fennimore on Qed.  Many restaurants in Pittsburgh use Ricci's sausage.  Some days you can watch them make the sausage thru a window.
