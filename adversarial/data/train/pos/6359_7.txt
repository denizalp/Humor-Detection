5 stars for the service alone. They have the nicest front counter staff working here and I really wish other ones would take a cue from them. The meat head to normal folks ratio is great and there are lesser folks in here that look roided out of their minds. Most equipment if not all are functional and that is not something I can say about the other ones I have been to. \n\nThe trainers aren't waiting to pounce on you as you walk in - also a plus in my book. I've never availed of the shakes and the smoothie bar so I cannot say anything about them but judging by the hand made signs and some of the older signs they still have up I am lead to think it ain't doin so well ! \n\nAs far as cleanliness goes it is pretty neat but it's a gym so if you are a germaphobe you wanna load up on the hand sanitizers. The locker room (mens) seem pretty clean and you never have to look for a empty one. \n\nHaving said all that it is a bit crowded at times but the wait times for equipment isn't obscene. \n\nOverall a wonderful place
