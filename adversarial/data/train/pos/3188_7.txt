An above average Vietnamese joint. But many Vietnamese joints are holes in the wall so that's not saying a whole lot.\n\nI've been here several times now and it's pretty consistant: extensive menu, fast service, friendly staff, decent food, and tea in plastic cups. \nFor various reasons, tea shouldn't be served in plastic cups. \nBut here, it is. I feel SO NAUGHTY. *sips tea* SOMEONE SPANK ME.
