Fresh and delicious\n\nThe bagels at Hot Bagels abd Deli are deliciously fresh.  My favorites are the Onion, Garlic, or everything. These bagel are everything a bagel should be.  The bagel's are crispy, chewy, garlicky, onion-y, salty perfection. \n\nThe Bagel breakfast sandwich was so delicious, so big, I thought I wouldn't be able to eat it all, but I did. Even though I was completely full from my breakfast sandwich I still left room for one of their delicious donuts.\n\nThe donuts from Beyond Donuts & Cafe are one of those tasty treats everyone should experience at least once. Hot, light, and fluffy. I could eat a dozen by myself what a delicious treat for a reasonable price.\n\nIf you're ever in the area and want to taste  delicious bagels & donuts, and expeirebce great customer service, stop in.  You won't be disappointed.
