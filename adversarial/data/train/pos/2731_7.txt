Should be called the Hogtown Stench. I came in over the weekend for breakfast with a friend. I got the BELT which was decent, but very stingy on the bacon. They cure their own meats and have an open kitchen with no closure to where the patrons sit. The smell is overwhelming. My friend and I had to change our clothes immediately after we left as we smelled like a pig roast. Do not go here if you have plans after!!
