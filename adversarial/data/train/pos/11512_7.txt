Worst customer service ever!  Ordered a cool dry ice goblet drink and waitress kept bugging us to pay right away instead of giving us time. There were plenty of tables, so it wasn't a case of us taking up space and we weren't even there for an hour. Supervisor came over and wasn't polite at all. He also told us to pay up and was extremely rude to the extent of him yelling at me. I will be sure never to set foot in this place. One star for the goblet dry ice drink but for $36 a pop, Not worth it at all. The dessert place at Aria is awesome! Go there! As for 24 hr food. Grand Lux in Venetian is way better.
