Absolutely worst experience in Vegas.  Half the computers were broken, props are old.  Cheesy exhibits.  For the amount of money we paid, even with our groupon deal, it was too much.  \n\nFind it on groupon if you MUST go, and only pay $15 per ticket.  \n\nAlso, this is inside the MGM Grand Hotel, all the way in the back.  It is a seriously long walk from the front.  While you are there, if you must go, you might as well do the CBS Television Research Lab Center.  That is free.  That's the only way this would be worth the money.  Budget 45-60 minutes.  \n\nThe MGM Hotel smells like a bad brothel of nasty perfume.  It was gross.  The whole hotel.
