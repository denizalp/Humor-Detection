My husband and I stopped in to Brass Tap for our first visit.   We were just looking to get a few drinks and check the place out.  Unfortunately, I am not a craft beer drinker, but they did had a very large beer selection.  I was disappointed they had no beers I would actually drink.  It really makes no sense for an establishment like this to not at least carry one \"lame\" domestic light beer for those of us who just want a simple beer.   I get this is a craft beer kind of place, but why alienate customers who just want a basic beer.   How about carry 199 craft beers and one domestic light beer way in the back of the cooler.  The service was decent and the place seemed ok,  but I can guarantee we will never return because of their beer selection.
