Don't visit Vegas without eating at Burger Bar.  This place has some of the best burgers you will find.  Burger Bar is located in the shopping mall in between the Mandalay Bay and Luxor hotels.\n\nAlong with a list of house burgers, Burger Bar has a huge variety of ingredients to build your own burger.  They have several different selections of buns, beef (including Angus and Kobe along with several other choices, different cheeses, bacon's and all sorts off different toppings you can add to it.  The ingredients are all top notch and you can't be disappointed unless you build a weird burger.\n\nThe burger I built was a-\nKobe Beef w\/ pepper jack cheese, jalapeno bacon, and sauteed onions on a wheat bun.  The Kobe Beef was extremely flavorful, juicy and tender.  All the ingredients were great quality and everything was perfectly prepared.  This burger was extremely tasty and I was sad to see it go.   I also had sweet potato fries which were fantastic.\nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/Cni2l-VKG_pdospJ6xliXQ?select=-riM6paMoa6XN6jLtD3zBA\nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/Cni2l-VKG_pdospJ6xliXQ?select=q7Qb3i0mT1xWHQ68VAauUw\n\nThey also have a cool beer selection, a variety of milkshakes, and a great atmosphere.\n\nBurger Bar is popular for a reason.
