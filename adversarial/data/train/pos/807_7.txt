This place is so new they don't have a sign outside or a printed menu but they do have a sign on the sidewalk letting you know you found it and an owner who asks you what you like and suggests the combo if you say tacos.. \n\nSo glad I found this little hole in the wall .. friendly staff and owner .. they seem genuinely happy to serve you.\n\nI had the three taco combo .. it comes with an al pastor, carne asada and bamba taco .. all three tacos were flavorful and the al pastor had a bit of grilled pineapple in it .. yum.. they ask if you like it hot or mild and bring you this delicious plate of goodness. \n\nIf you're in the area and enjoy no fuss food with lots of flavor served to you by a cook who enjoys serving people .. you gotta stop by and support this place! \n\nCash only at this time !! Come ready to eat!!
