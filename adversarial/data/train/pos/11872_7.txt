This is a paradise if you are a senior looking for a retirement home. The carpeting, decor and the attire screams bingo for 80 year olds.\n\nNever have I seen such a bad assortment of badly done foods. The fish had a distinctive fishy taste, the prime rib was well done which is a crime, the chicken had a layer of slime on top, the mashed potatoes needed gravy which likely meant it wasn't going to be good enough on its own, and I basically stopped there.\n\nTheir dessert section looked like they had just lifted the bakery section from a Wal-Mart. Their soft serve machine reminded me of Hometown Buffet, their chocolate fountain looked like they picked it up from Target, and their enormous cotton candy made me think they were too cheap to give us gelato or crepes.\n\nNo no no.\n\nNo.
