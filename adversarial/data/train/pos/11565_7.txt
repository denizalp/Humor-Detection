Skincare is my life. My products are seriously bordering on the Korean 10-step method (not necessarily Korean-brand exclusive, of course) but I'm always on the lookout for new items to slather on my face. The Face Shop had a pretty awesome deal going on, and they're really in-your-face about it. The advertisements for \"buy one get one 50% off\" is placed all over the tiny store, so it's hard to miss this bargain.\n\nI'm a die-hard Sephora fan, but I also purchase a lot of Korean brand products online, so I know that these cute cosmetics can be really hit or miss. I usually steer clear from the Face Shop simply because it seems to veer towards a less expensive path? It doesn't feel right that a lot of their products are discounted 70% of the time. I was running low on a few items, however, so I decided to purchase.\n\nThere was only one sales lady and one cashier taking care of this shop that was totally bloated with customers. The bright store is super pretty and decked out in all kinds of nifty makeup that is also not high quality. The lip tint is so watery and almost pastel-like in color, and their cushion compact is different from other brands; you have to press a button for the foundation to squeeze out from a tiny hole, which is really odd. \n\nThey gave me one sample only, which is depressing because Korea is famous for their excessive sample giving, but when in Canada, do what the Canadians do I suppose. The peeling mask that was given for free really burned my skin when I used it, but I do happen to have very sensitive skin to begin with. I probably won't return here to be honest.
