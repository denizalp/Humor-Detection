While visiting Charlotte from home on the west coast,\nthis was certainly one of the stops I liked most.\nDo try the gelati; it is ever so nice,\nwith its decadent custard and smooth tasty ice.\n\nThe great many flavors can make it tough to choose,\nbut each of them's awesome, so you really can't lose.\nCheck out the selection; try a sample or three...\nthe service is perfect, as friendly as could be.\n\nYounger customers aren't overlooked 'cause they're small;\nthey're perhaps those accommodated most of all.\nWith cartoons on the tube and a handy stepstool,\nthis would be a fine place for a treat after school.\n\nritasmatthews.com has the current info,\nlike flavors of the day, to keep you in the know.\nI can't wait for Rita's to arrive in CA;\nI'd be tempted to try something new every day.\n\nproduct:  5 stars\nvalue:  4 stars\nservice:  5 stars\n\nP.S.
