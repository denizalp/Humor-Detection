I believe that all Walmarts are made in Hell. This place is no exception; crafted by Lucifer himself to make me dread buying shampoo. \n\nUnfortunately I needed shampoo one day after work on the West side, so instead of driving home and further, we went a little roundabout way to the Steelyard Commons. \n\nShoot, that was a bad idea. Nothing was stocked (ESPECIALLY deodorant, which, if you ask me, is one of the most important things at Walmart) and the staff was angry (of course, but come on folks, stop mean mugging ME--I didn't do this to you!) and the fellow customers made me fearful. Not kidding. I was scared when I was searching for my deodorant (it wasn't there in the end). \n\nNever going back. I'll drive the extra miles to go somewhere else. I'll waste time to go somewhere else. I'll even choose another Walmart over Walmart...and that's bad.
