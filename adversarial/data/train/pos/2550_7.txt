How many ways can you spell DISAPPOINTED!!!!! I have had better BBQ on a HUNGRY MAN DINNER. \n\nI had a friend in from Chicago this evening who was staying at the ALOFT by the airport. I wanted to impress him with the BBQ at HB's as he has taken me to some really great places in Chicago. This HB's was the first one I had eaten at when I first arrived in PHX. I last ate here 2 years ago when I was on Van Buren and the food was great!!!! What Happened???\n\nWe arrived at about 7:45. When we walked in both men were texting on their cell phones and did not really seem to care much about anything else. The person working the counter a tall man of ethnic origin was kind of aloof and on the rude side. I got the BBQ Chicken and my guest got the BBQ Pulled Pork. Total Cost: $19.63 which BTW was a great year. The food was out in 5 minutes so you know a lot of care was taken in the cooking and preparation. The Chicken did not taste fresh. It was soft and moist like it should be but it tasted like a reheat from 2 days past. Presentation was HORRIBLE! My friends pulled pork sandwich was served on a white hamburger bun and the sauce saturated it so much that he could not hold it to eat it. The bun should have at least been toasted.\n\nI was extremely embarrassed as my friend threw more than half of it away.\n\nIn the not so distant past I ate at the Honey Bears on Elliot and Priest.  It is close to my home and the food was consistently good and we went every other month. I guess every chain has a BRONZE store and I guess HB's on 5012 E Van Buren St Phoenix, AZ 85008 is the B@$T@RD child of the chain.\n\nMy advice....try someplace else where they want your business and serve FRESH food.\n\nI am Jeff and I call em as I see em!\n\nBTW if you are handicapped they have a ramp but the parking lot is so uneven and has course asphalt, it is a major trip\/fall hazard.
