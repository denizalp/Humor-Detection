I have to be completely honest... this is the worst Vegas show I have ever seen.  Not only did he use old, outdated material but when he laid on the floor while holding up his hand doing a \"Kermit the Frog\" impression that was my cue to exit stage left.  My poor BF was such a huge fan and was really excited but he too could not even mutter a sympathy laugh for this guy.  Spent a total of $140 for two tickets and left a hot blackjack table to see this guy ... boo!\nBTW... this guy just became a headliner in Vegas even though he was on Mad TV ... we'll see how long that lasts!
