I tell EVERYONE to go here, but nobody wants to stop on their way to Vegas when they are all excited, nor do they want to stop on the way home when they are hungover and broke.\n\nFor those who do, the place is thee most amazing retail space. Totally free, it is a MUST SEE.  Aside from the massive amount of gear available, the animal displays are natural-museum quality, the decor includes rocky waterfalls and aquariums, with mermaids on select days in the huge tank at the entrance.\n\nBest of all it has a underused, challenging and fun Frontierland-like shooting gallery, which I admit needs some calibration and technical attention.  For example, I shot the can and it wiggled (it used to shoot up) and I shot the skunk and instead of lifting it's tail, it either deeply pondered its existence as a key to self-mastery and consciousness, endowed with Mind, the agency through which mental awareness emerges where one is able to ponder existence, naturally dominating its own mind to achieve inner silence, or it was broken.
