Montreals first authentic taqueria, no offence to Grumman '78 and their cohorts - who have great and interesting tacos, but the price is way out of line with that of street food tacos in Mexico or even sky-high priced San Francisco taquerias. This little joint, housed in a classic old Montreal hot dog diner, delivers the authentic goods, with great prices to match ($1.50-3.50 per taco, with even better combo deals). A Mexican chef, no frills decor and no pretence. Good joint to eat.
