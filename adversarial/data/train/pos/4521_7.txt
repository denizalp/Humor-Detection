Unconscionable that any establishment can't afford an actual outgoing message on their phone line.  I had to walk 10 blocks in the broiling AZ sun to find out from a hand-written note taped to the door that they were running shorter hours and not serving dinner now.  \nCan't call ahead and ask, because nobody is there.  \nFood might be top notch, but when they're running random hours and can't be bothered to update their info on Yelp, they deserve no stars.  Unfortunately I have to give them one star because otherwise I can't put this warning out there.  DO NOT GO WITHOUT CALLING FIRST, and if you don't talk to a human, DON'T WASTE ANOTHER SECOND but move on to another place that knows how to run a business.
