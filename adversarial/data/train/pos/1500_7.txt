This resort was recently taken over by another holding company and is no longer a Kimpton Hotel. I love Kimptons and so when I found out it was switching (after we booked) I was bummed. However, so far they've decided to keep with tradition- the daily wine hour from 5-6 and S'mores by the firepits from 7-10. I appreciate these tiny details. Their coffee in the morning is so good! They even offer espresso with syrups so you can make an iced latte if you desire.\nIt is a smaller resort which I like. The pool is very nice and has plenty of sun and shade. The employees are very nice- though they could be a little more on top of things. Often we'd have to walk up to the bar to order or get water because there were no servers walking around. \nThe rooms are decent and the beds are comfortable. Housekeeping is terrible. One day our room didn't get cleaned until after 7:00 PM! Even at that, all they did was make up the beds. I doubt they even vacuumed. \nThe food by the pool comes from the restaurant and it's very good. I had the greens salad with beets and chicken two days in a row. The chicken was a bit dry. The truffle fries are really good and my friends also had the sliders which they enjoyed. \nThe free wi-fi is not secure and is terrible. You can't get onto anything. I ended up using my own data. You can upgrade for $15 but I found that ridiculous.\nAll in all, I would definitely stay here again. The location is fantastic. You can walk to Fashion Square (the huge mall) or even Old Town where are the awesome restaurants are- though you don't have to. Firesky offers a free shuttle within a 3 mile radius. We had them drop us off at Camelback one day and then come and pick us up. Unless you're planning long outings, you really have no need for a car here. Though if you have one, the parking is free!
