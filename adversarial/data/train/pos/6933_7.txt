Oh Dreamy Draw Park, how you kick my ass and I keep coming back for more.  I have been frequenting this part of the Phoenix Mountain Preserve for a few weeks now thanks to a suggestion\/invitation from Dally.  We have since included our friend Drew to join us in attempting to conquer the numerous trails and unforgiving hills.  It has quickly become the after work running spot.\n\nThe easiest way to enter the park is off of the Squaw Peak, err, Piestewa Peak Parkway and the Northern exit.  To the east is the winding road to the park.  The parking lot can be full depending on the weather and time of day.  Most of the time there is still room, even on a busy day.  \n\nThere are numerous trails to choose from and different levels of difficulty.  Lots of mountain bikers, dogs, and even some horses.  They even have a trough at the parking lot.  Drew is threatening to jump in it during the summer.  West Nile and all!!!\n\nThis is just another example of why Phoenix may just be the greatest city in the history of man!  There are points on your hike\/run\/ride where you can not see civilization and you feel like Bear Grylls on Man vs. Wild, looking for shrubs and little insects to eat should you get stranded.  Then you hear a plane or helicopter and realize you will be saved.\n\nSide note:  The bathrooms can be a bit sketchy.  There are no doors on the stalls, in the Mens room at least.  Not sure about the Womens.
