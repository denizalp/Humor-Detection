Amazing place to leave I feel so safe here but more importantly I know I can leave my wife home alone an she will be fine. On top of that they accepted my dogs which was very important to me , great place to live I I highly recommend it to anyone seeking a new living opportunity.\n\nPSA \" IF YOU DONT MIND THE COPS THEN YOULL LOVE IT HERE THE POLICE ARE HERE ONCE SGAIN FOR THE 3\/4 time this past 5 days , they have it taped off the have a detective taking pictures of a crime scene there was shots let off during the time of the crime they have K-9 units everywhere this is beyond ridiculous, I guess this proves you can't ever get away an live somewhere nice. And I personally have had my fair share with the police but none of them know that but they stare me down like I'm the one who busted off tonight..
