Why did I go for the chili dog? I don't like american cheese (it's for hillbillies) and....I don't like Chili unless it's in a bowl served by my mother....\nSooo....I scraped everything off and I enjoyed the after taste of chili on my hot dog.\n\nDisa opted for the brooklyn dog....(or the heart attack dog) lol but she enjoyed it I believe it was topped with pastrami.\n\nall in all I shouldn't have went crazy....\n\nit's really expensive.....two dogs two drinks was about $20....I'm from chicago...if the dog isn't $1.95....I'm looking for the gold flakes!
