Great company, and great experience from start to finish. They came in less than our other quotes, even with the upgraded paint, which is always a nice plus. But on top of that, everyone we dealt with was very professional and courteous, and they were able to get our house done much sooner than we hoped. It took two days, one day of very thorough prep, and one day of paint. The crew was there at 6 am on painting day, and were done by noon. Awesome. The house looks brand new.
