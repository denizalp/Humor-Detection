I did NOT have any problem with them I walked in and told them I found a kirby and that I needed a belt and some bags. He did Not try to sell me anything more then what I asked for. I wish he did because I found out that you could put the newest model brush roll in the G-six that I found and that it improves the vacuum to be very close if not the Same as the newest model kirby diamond and sentria. Now I have to go back and ask for the brush roll.
