I came here with the bf for a pedicure (he brought me not the other way around!)  He is a fan of regular pedicures so we made it a couple adventure haha. This salon is huge and has extended hours.  They are open until 11pm but there is an extra $5 charge for services done after 7pm. \n\nPedicures started at $25 for the regular and worked it's way up depending on other options you want. I didn't need champagne and chocolate so I was good.  I was very happy that the tools were in sterile packs like at the dentist. The ladies were great and very kind.  We came in as walk-ins and we had to wait a little because we we got there in between shifts but it was only about 15-20 minutes.  Not bad at all.\n\nI would definitely come back the next time I'm in Vegas to visit. I want to try a gel manicure sometime!
