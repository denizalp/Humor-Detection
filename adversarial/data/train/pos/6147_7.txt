I normally love Keegans. \n\nI especially love the Keegans on Ray and 48th street; great food and service!!! I just recently heard about the Camelback location's remodel. I had previously been there and it needed a face lift. Tonight I went in with ym family. The atmosphere looks amazing... Great job with the remodel! However, I had really a really poor experience. My dad arrived first and a male server came over to greet him (he ordered a beer and water). Then I arrived... No one came over for like 10 minutes. Then my mom arrived and still no one for about another 5-8 minutes. I flagged down another server and told her we needed our server. She looked at me all shocked, and said \"Oh, ok Ill try and find who it is\". Not a very professional response. Anyway, we finally get another girl, who was very sweet, and she said she'd be helping us. As she was getting our drinks the male server finally returned, didn't address us, but asked our \"new server\" to just take the table and passed her my dad's beer... Really unprofessional. We ended up having great service with our new server. The only other thing that bothered me, was that I ordered the taproom steak sandwich. I have had this several times over the years at all 3 locations. Tonight I got it and it looked like half the normal portion! What happened Keegan's did we skim back? It was literally 2 small steaks (maybe 1.5lbs each instead of the normal 3lbs each). I just think that's really skimpy for a $14 dollar meal. I hope this is helpful criticism because I do love the Keegan's restaurants and normally have good service. I was just really disappointed tonight and thought you needed to know!
