I've visited this place a couple of times, and to me, it's pretty average. Located just diagonal to Terroni on Adelaide (east of Yonge St. and Adelaide St. E), and just a couple doors down from XO Bisous, I visited early on a weekday morning and found it semi-busy, but not so much that the lineup was intimidating.\n\nI ordered a regular coffee and found it just okay. It tasted pretty basic, and didn't stand out to me as a truly excellent brew. It didn't have over roasted notes (thankfully), but it also lacked a certain boldness that would have made it memorable. Overall, average coffee.\n\nHowever, what this place has going for it is its space. Very minimal, very clean and sleek. There are tables to do work, with big windows and natural light. It's a good spot to sit for a coffee date, do some reading or some work. \n\nI don't know if I'd go out of my way to come back here just specifically for another cup of coffee, but I'd consider coming in to enjoy the space if I'm in the area (although they do have some stiff competition with XO Bisous next door, which, personally, I prefer).
