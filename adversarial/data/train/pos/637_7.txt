Well. \n\nThe front of the house couldn't be better. Fabulous appearance, extremely attentive service, courteous server. High end glassware and place settings.  The server's presentation of the food builds your expectations...\n\nBut.\n\nThe food shatters the image.  We ordered a main dish, the goat cheese tortellini as an appetizer to share.  Good thing we didn't expect to fill up on this sad serving of 3 limp, lifeless blobs.  It was evident that the pasta was fresh but the flavor and texture were lacking.  And, I am being gentle.\nFrom there, we were scared to adventure in to other creative dishes so we stayed \"safe\" with the burger and fries.  Ordered medium, the hockey puck came out well-done with soggy fries to match.  Aye. My wife made me send it back threatening a better meal at the Burger King.  We rarely complain but we asked the server for a new burger, he obliged, graciously.  He served us some complementary bread items which were nice and fresh.  The new burger and fries arrived shortly and were upgraded from an F to a C+, at best.\n\nWe were happy with the option for small or large pours of wine.  I really want Province to pull it together because it has great potential.  On a previous occasion, I enjoyed a burger, fries and margarita over happy hour in the bar.  I will be back because I remain hopeful for you, Province.
