Condado is whatever you want it to be! Build your own taco with a huge list of delicious ingredients. \nWe have 3 upscale taco joints in Pittsburgh and somehow they have all been able to differentiate themselves. Condado's  build your own is how they stand out. \nYou can't start your meal without getting the guacamole and chips. So don't think about it just do it. And drink. ..they have a crazy list of margaritas including banana?!\nEvery time I come here I get a chicken taco, a seafood taco, and a pork taco. Every time I leave I have dreams about the pork taco! Make sure you get pineapple salsa on it. Whatever magic they cook their pork in is heaven. \n\nWhen you order, 2 tacos will fill you up but I always get a third that makes my car smell...but it stinks so good and can be like a pheromone for some men. \n\nEnjoy! I always do!
