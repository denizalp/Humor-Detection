BUYER BEWARE!!!  Repeatedly told me they don't have room in their lot to return my lease.  They're not willing to take the vehicle because I leased it out of state.  Kia policy is that customers may return to any Kia dealership.  They always begin but asking where I leased it from.  When they realize I leased out of state and am not buying another Kia, they say they don't have room in the lot.  Even though over the phone they say they have room and even made an appointment for me to come in to return my lease.  Floor Manager accuses me of calling him a liar and told me to get out of the store.  No point in yelling back at him.  Pursuing the matter with Kia Consumer Affairs and regional director.  I understand can't make every customer happy, but the treatment and service I received was pathetic.  They should be embarrassed to have \"Joey D\" working for them.  So, Congratulations,  I will turn your lease in at Henderson on Wednesday.  Consumer Affairs made the appointment for me.  In return, I will discourage anyone I ever speak to from going to your dealership.  It will cost  me nothing, and it may cost Findlay Kia future customers.  It pays better to be nice :)
