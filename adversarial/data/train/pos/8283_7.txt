Picture Arizona on a warm summer evening. Over at Chase Field, the roof keeps the heat out and the AC in, a batter hits the ball out of the park, the smell of burgers, dogs and fries lingers in the stands and fans cheer on their favorite players while they enjoy a nice cold beer. \n\nWhen I look at Chase Field -- a beautiful state of the art ballpark -- I expect to see the stands completely full. At times they are, but the majority of the time they could use many more warm bodies to keep the seats company.  What better way to spend a day or evening than by visiting a baseball stadium equipped with a roof to keep the heat out, nonstop discounts and deals for baseball fans, a restaurant overlooking the field, family-fun activities, solid baseball \"dining\" and a professional baseball team playing right in front of your eyes. So why at the seats empty? Who knows. I know it's not the stadium itself, so maybe a World Series would help. :) \n\nI like Chase Field because it's spacious, clean and filled with amenities for whatever type of experience you're looking for. Whether it be rowdy times at a private pool, a family fun activity center in left field, TGI Friday's front row where you can watch the game while you dine, dugout seats with all the food and drink you can imagine or club level seats with your own server,  Chase Field appeals to all audiences and I always have a different positive experience every time I visit. \n\nChase Field is a gorgeous stadium and one that deserves much more love then they get. Parking is seamless, entry is fast and efficient, the staff is friendly and the amenities are nice. The fro yo addict in me loves the TCBY stations. The fat kid in me loves everything else they serve from chicken tenders to the burgers. \n\nSo if I'm ever looking for something fun to do during the baseball season, I also think about Chase Field because it's a great way to escape from the heat and enjoy some entertainment in a state of the art park.
