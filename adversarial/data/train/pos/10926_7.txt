I had to make it a point to stop in and check out the famous location of Pawn Stars. It was easy to find with ample parking on both sides of the building and a line to get in. There is no admission or parking fees but I can see that coming down the road. Being a famous Pawn Shop I thought there would be some really good deals on some nice watches and jewelry, however after browsing through the cases I realized this is stuff people had for a while. Most of the watches are old and dated and the jewelry were out of style.\n\nThe rest of the store was interesting and they were selling all kinds of souvenirs and T-shirts. I am sure they were selling more souvenirs then merchandise. There was a line in the back where the guy who authenticates historical items was signing post cards. The lady who authenticates books was coming in right after him. This is a neat tourist attraction and not so much a Pawn Shop. They did have Willie Mays Uniform in a display case. Neither Rick, Big Hoss, The Old Man or Chumlee were there. I think Chumlee did have the most souvenir pieces though.
