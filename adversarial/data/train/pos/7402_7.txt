I'm just saying \"Yes\" to life, cause' you gotta say \"Yes\" to life and in this cafe that is well named, \"Yes Cafe\"!\n\nInexpensive, combination of unique and classic milk teas, slushes and the like with typical Taiwanese and Chinese meals and snacks. I stopped in for a quick drink after dinner and got the Jasmine Green Tea with Boba and Egg Pudding. The milk tea was recommended by a lovely women, perhaps the owner, who made sure it wasn't too sweet. The drinks are pretty cheap, as they should be and only about $5 for a large sized drink with two toppings.\n\nThe boba was a bit overdone, though still a little chewy and sweet, the egg pudding is more on the jelly side and not as creamy but tasted good. The Jasmine Green Tea was surprisingly good, fresh tasting, tea flavor as one would expect and best of all not too sweet. Probably one of the best boba drinks I've had in Arizona in a while. I would say Yes Cafe and TeaStreet are the best and compare very similarly to that of milk teas in California, where bubble tea shops run rampant.\n\nGreat little mom and pop type boba shop. Tons of seating and games to play with friends, played a good game of Battleship although a bit sticky! They play popular Top 40s music that isn't too loud. Also props for closing at 11 p.m. on a Friday unlike the other boba shops that close early.\n\nSaw that they have snacks and have been fiending for Popcorn chicken and it looks like this place definitely has them. I'll have to be back to try them out!\n\nThey take both cash and card here.
