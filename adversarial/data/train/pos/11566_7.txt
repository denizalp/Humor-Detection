Stopped by after being in the area and needing a bottle of wine to take to a monthly social function.  All was well, upon entry...I was pursing the wine aisle looking for something to complement the several vegan chili's I was about to try.  An attentive lady approached and offered up a selection which I would eventually end up purchasing.  I looked at the beer cooler and spied some Joseph James ( a local Brewer) lager and quickly snatched it up.  All this was leading up to great experience until.........check out.  Some dude came up to the register FAR to interested in the connection he had with an NFL football playoff game.  Far to interested in talking with with the nice lady who had helped me, while trouble shooting whatever issue they were dealing with regarding reception, I silently thought to myself...If I wanted this mediocre customer service...I should have driven up the road to Uncle Lee's.  Decent selection BUT customer service which would (thanks to the Seahawks) end up circling the drain. Meh!
