Hmm, Yelp took down my picture after the new owner complained. My picture clearly showed my freshly manicured nails and my badly cut cuticles. Still by far the worst mani\/pedi experience ever!!! I had sores from my cut cuticles for quite some time after which scabbed. Not cool, Yelp! \n\nAlso, they did offer a free mani OR pedi to make up for the experience. Reminder, I paid for BOTH and on my bday... Thanks, but no thanks!\n\nOh and real professional comment on my prior review. How will that re-earn my business? PS: Not all of my reviews are negative. They are accurate accounts of my experience reflecting my opinions. After all, that's what Yelp is for! Customers, steer clear!\n\nGood luck!
