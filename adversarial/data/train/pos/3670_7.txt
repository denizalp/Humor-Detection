So, being from Illinois, I'd never had a \"ripper\" which it turns out, is a deep-fried hot dog and in this case, smothered with fantastic slaw and all kinds of other delicious items which I can no longer recall. The perogis? Exactly right. Giganto potato wedges with ballpark mustard? C'mon. \n\nLion hosted a fantastic weekend of Mods vs Rockers complete with a giant parking lot for the meet-and-greet plus a huge menu with something for everybody (I wasn't feeling too adventurous when I got into town so they whipped up a simple mushroom\/Swiss burger for me) and an equally huge beer list from cheap to not cheap. There's a ton of space for your friends, lots of space to park your motorcycles and scooters and a really long bar to prop you up as you go.\n\nIt's been added to my \"Cleveland Rocks\" destination itinerary. Thanks, Lion.
