I love ice cream on hot days, and normally don't go out to get it, except for when its scortching hot.  Last night, I was hot, so I decided to go and get some coldstone.\n\nI think coldstone is good, and love the fact that they have late hours and are close to home. Thier ice cream is rich and delicous, with many options of stuff to have put in it.  I can't eat it all the time, but it is a nice tasty treat to have!
