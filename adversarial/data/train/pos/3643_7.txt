Oooh la la!! .... wait, that's French.  I meant... mama mia!  Lol.  Whatever the phrase, this joint is a must try Italian place.  The environment is pleasant to the eye with a fusion of modernity meets old world charm.  \nThe service is wonderful.  It's on the formal side, but to me, as long as they are good at what they do, i am satisfied.\nOnto the food.  For appetizer i opted for Calamari Alla Griglia which is grilled calamari after fiding out that the Cozze Marinara mussels were not available.  The calamari was a good substitute though as the meat was super tender with just enough touch of flavor.  Then i moved onto Branzino, a pan seared fillet of Mediterranean Sea Bass with greens.  The taste of lemon garlic and white wine sauce was bold and unapologetic,  and so it should be.  To end the meal,  of course i had to go with tiramisu.  Heavenly.
