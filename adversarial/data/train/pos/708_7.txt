Decided to go here since I wanted something quick and easy for dinner. I ordered the crunchwrap combo which came with a taco and a drink. Food was good, but the shell in the crunchwrap wasn't crunchy :(. The employees here are really enthusiastic which was quite a surprise! Friendly and awesome attitude is always a good thing. I'll drop by here again sometime and check out the other menu items.
