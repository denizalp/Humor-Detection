I LOVE TACOS ! ! ! ! !\n\nJust not these.... \n\nI was looking forward to delicious tacos on Cinco De Mayo, but Sadly I cannot claim this my favorite taco joint. Nothing screamed delicious at me and If I wouldn't have been starved, I might not have finished my vampiro. The salsa they included on it was so extremely spicy I had to chug the Dr. Pepper we were sharing. Our poor son was still hungry after leaving because he couldn't finish his tacos due to the heat. Our mouths were on FIRE! The boyfriend didn't mind it too much, but he's always had a thing for spicy. \n\nThe meat had flavor just no moisture. The taco filling ratio was off - not enough meat to toppings. They messed up our order in a few ways which is understandable since it was busy and there was only one cook (I'm assuming it was the husband). \n\nIt's a great location and a nice atmosphere on the inside, but I don't think I'll be back. Not unless the boyfriend wants to try it again later down the road. I won't be going out of my way though.
