I still remember going to Esmeralda's as a little girl. My mothers boyfriend at the time was Salvadorian so we would frequent it a lot back in the late nineties, early two thousands. Not a lot has changed since then. \n\nI still come from time to time, sometimes I call in an order and pick it up for lunch. I don't work too far so it's a cheap, convenient meal. The pupusas are really good and a steal at $1.50 each, although I do prefer the revueltas versus the other filling options they offer, they come with a red salsa and curtido (chopped cabbage in vinegar). The platanos fritos con crema y frijol are also really good, I love dipping the plantains in the beans, it's mix of sweetness and saltiness that I can tolerate without being grossed out. To wash your meal down, I recommend an ensalada. It's a homemade fruit drink with little chunks of apple. \n\nI've never had a problem with service, there is normally a sweet older lady that hands me my order, other times, a younger woman replaces her, let's just say she's not the friendliest, she's very cold in comparison, doesn't smile, and just seems miserable, but she is never rude.
