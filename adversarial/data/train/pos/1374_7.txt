The Hash Kitchen is a nicely appointed, modern restaurant featuring great food. I love the decor and look of the resturant as well as the location with plenty of parking adjacent, as it is in the Shops at Gainey Ranch Plaza. \n\nThe filling breakfast I had here on my last day visiting Scottsdale was spectacular. I had a Rumchata coffee drink and it was delightful. My skillet breakfast concoction with biscuit was trey deliciosa. \n\nService was great and efficient. I enjoy that the Hash Kitchen has local owners who also own (other concept) restaurants in the city. Check out the pictures of the famous customers that have been there by the host podium (Phelps, etc.) I will definitely be back.
