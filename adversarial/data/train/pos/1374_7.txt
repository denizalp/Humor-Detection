If I could give a negative star I would. \n\nIf you want internet, cable or a REAL landline, well then, Cox does NOT provide it! If you want cheap and bad cable\/internet service then go with Cox. If you want a landline, then look up Magic Jack! \nThe monopoly of cable companies in Southern Nevada are a joke. \n\nIn short, I am disappointed. \n\nOn a positive note, their Customer Service\nDepartment is really sympathetic as if the\nCustomer Service Representatives know that the company they work for sucks :)
