PV mall would make a great setting for a zombie movie... if all of the zombies had arm band tattoos and nose piercings.  \n\nThis place was okay 15 years ago but now it's just well,  depressing.  \n\nThankfully, there is a Costco anchoring this place on the west side of the mall. (that's good for one extra rating star)
