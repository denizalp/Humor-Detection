Does anyone remember that scene from \"The Simpson's Movie\" where Ned Flanders makes that super sexy hot chocolate and gives it to Bart? Well guess what y'all? I had that super sexy hot chocolate!!! The frozen version of it! I've been wanting to try this place forever.  I went in New York awhile back, but the nearly 3 hour wait caused me to leave.  So, I tried it in Las Vegas! Situated on the strip, in front of Caesar's Palace, it's a great location.  Excellent people watching opportunities.  We had dinner elsewhere, so we only opted for dessert here.  They are pretty pricey, but the servings are massive.  More than enough to share.  We sat at the bar, the server was friendly and poured us glasses of iced water as soon as we sat down.  My husband and I decided to share the frrozen hot chocolate, ($16) and our friend got the banana split.  The server told him that he should probably get the smaller size of the banana split, since the one he opted for was massive.  He was right! When he got the small size, it was still the biggest banana split ever.  Everything was incredibly delicious. \n\nThe only reason I'm docking a star is because our friends wanted coffee, but were told they would need to go inside themselves and order coffee as he can't make it in that area.  So, they went inside and were told by the employee inside that the server should have actually gone in and ordered it for them. Hmm. Also, about halfway through our visit, there was suddenly an odd smell at the outside area.. The place is right on the strip so it could have been coming from there, but regardless..it was kind of gross, and I'm glad we were pretty much done by the time it appeared.
