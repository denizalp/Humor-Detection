There's an important saying: \"You can't buy happiness, but you can buy pizza... which is kind of the same thing.\"\n\nUnfortunately for this place, it did not live up to that \"pizza happiness.\"\n\nIf you've ever been to Pieology, it's very similar. If you've never been to Pieology, then it's very similar to how Chipotle runs.. and if you've never been to Chipotle... well then I don't know what to tell you.\n\nAnyways, you have basically 3 options from the menu. You can: 1) make your own with unlimited toppings 2) select a cheese pizza or 3) choose one of their pre-selected pizzas.\n\nI went with my fianc√© and of course we chose the unlimited toppings! I don't eat any pork, so I chose chicken as my meat. I lathered on Alfredo sauce and covered that bad boy in a bunch of veggies. The 'za didn't take long to bake, but I was fairly disappointed. I wanted all my toppings to be melted in and the mushrooms were that over cooked, squishy texture that I love. We ordered a side salad, which to be honest... could have been it's own meal by itself (KUDOS for that!) but it was simple.\n\nI do have to say I love the decor and that they have a little bar you can sit at. Oh! Did I forget to mention they serve beer? Who doesn't love beer and pizza?! (Unless you're under 21, then that's a no to you, you youngins!)\n\nAll in all, this place rated about average for us. It was delicious at the time, but I was starving. But I definitely won't be returning anytime soon. Throw me a $5 pizza from Lil Cesar's any day.
