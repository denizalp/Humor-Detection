Here's a revelation - I suffered from severe acne for a number of years. I went to dermatologists, took prescription drugs, smeared creams that stung and burned on my skin but nothing worked. I tried everything skin care gimmick out there from that famous infomercial acne system to Chinese remedies. NOTHING WORKED. \n\nAfter walking by Pure + Simple many times, I did a little research. I found  numerous articles and testimonials about how amazing this place was. There was also a mention of one particular aesthetician - Georgetta. \n\nI booked an Urban Renewal Facial with her. She analyzed my skin, cleansed, steamed, extracted, masked, rinsed, moisturized my skin until it glowed. While I had the mask on, she gave me a back, arm, leg and foot massage. I was in a state of bliss and relaxation. I didn't even care that I could hear people walking in the hallway or the muffled conversations going on at the front of the spa. \n\nAfter the facial, Georgetta recommended a facial every 6 weeks and some products. It wasn't a hard sell unlike other spas. I bought a package of 10 facials and the products she recommended. After 5 months, my acne was gone. If you think you've tried everything, give Pure + Simple a try. They could very well be what you were looking for.
