When I lived here police were almost always arresting people in my front yard (not really MY front yard but in front of my house) and\/or breaking fights. Fights were breaking out almost every weekend! Loud talking neighbors who don't know how to use their quiet voices at night- they weren't fighting but they were just loud! You can hear your neighbors TV going off, when they vacuumed, and so much more!  \n\nThe first appt. was crap! It took the maintenance crew almost a year to ALMOST fix the A\/C. When we first moved in we noticed a strong scent of marijuana inside our unit. After a couple of days we realized there was pot hiding behind the the water heater along with a pipe! We didn't want to touch it so told the office to get it out- they did and said they were \"sorry\". Honestly I don't smoke pot -I did when I was in Highschool (almost everyone does in Maui) but I grew up and out of it!  \n\n After ALMOST fixing our A\/C we were fed up w\/ every guy who came to our front door. The office actually gave us another unit bigger than what we had, for a cheaper price -but still more $$ than what we were paying but not by much. The A\/C worked but there were cockroaches EVERYWHERE! And I don't mean one or 2 here and there I mean they were coming out from the sinks in group sizes and... just freakin freaky! I couldn't sleep! I'd be in the kitchen or in the bathroom for 30 min each night killing, spraying, using anything to kill them with, but they were still coming! The bug man came, and came each week to no avail- they were back again! Finally the fumed the entire section AFTER months of spraying! The office started getting into yelling matches with my husband and hanging up on him during complaints! Between the office getting defensive w\/ us, the crimes, and the lack of knowledge on how to get things fixed around there -we had enough! We moved out after dealing with them for 2 years!
