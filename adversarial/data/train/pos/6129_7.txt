There's a handful of places that serve pineapple soft-serve\/froyo or Dole whip. However, they're in Henderson or Boulder City. \n\nI love pineapples and Dole Pineapple Whip Float reminds me of good times: Disneyland and Dole Plantation in Hawaii. I'd get pineapple cravings at random times and inconveniently when I'm on the opposite end of Boulder City\/ Henderson. So, I'm glad there's a place that has pineapple treats within a 15-mile radius from me.\n\nThis is located inside Boulevard Mall food court. Park by Sears or Old Navy and use the entrance in between those two places and that will take you to the food court. I'm not a fan of this mall so, I seriously just went for Pineapple Park.\n\nI was greeted by the owner's lovely wife who took my order. She told me that they've been open since August 1st and that they're opening up a location Downtown next month, Fashion Show Mall in Feb 2015 and Summerlin Mall some time in 2015. I was so amused that I ended up getting my Dole Whip Float in a souvenir cup. I was walking around all day with a pineapple in my purse. The DWF had a fresh pineapple spear with the usual pineapple soft-serve and pineapple juice.\n\nThey have other items on the menu. They have orange and raspberry soft-serve. The raspberry was nice and tart.\n\nThey gave me a stamp card. Getting the souvenir cup wasn't a bad idea because I'd get 50% off on my next DWF's, yay!
