I was forced to give this 1 star, when I really didn't want to rate them at all.\n\nKeep in mind, I am NOT rating the food, but the HORRIBLE HORRIBLE customer service I received.\n\nI have never had to write a review before, but I felt I had to after my last experience at this location. I have NEVER experienced such POOR, SLOW service at any restaurant I have been to, in comparison to this one. I had called 30 minutes in advance on a Friday for a bento box pickup, when arriving I was told I had to wait another 30 minutes for my \"pick up\" order. I get it, it was a busy Friday lunch hour, but what I didn't get, was the patrons who finished eating, were served before me, the walkins ordered and were also served before me. I think these new owners were picking and choosing who should be served (I was picking up 1 measly bento box!) I asked for refund, to which the server kept brushing me off. And when I finally caught her attention and said I was walking out, she said, \"oh, it's right here.\" I was pretty livid. I arrived back at work late from my lunch, only to discover -- no soya sauce. I have decided to boycott going to this location EVER AGAIN. I have since spread the word at my company for everyone to follow suit, removed them from my phone list, and have erased ever eating there from my memory.
