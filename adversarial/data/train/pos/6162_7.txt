Walmart Neighborhood Market concentrates on groceries more so than general merchandise. So if you're looking for their snazzy clothes you'll be out of luck here. \n\nThey had everything I needed on my grocery list.\n2 thumbs up!\n\nThe store was clean, shelves stocked and good signage made it easier to find items I was looking for.  \n\nI was pleased with the produce selection and the reasonable prices.\n\nThe difference between WM Neighborhood Market vs Super WM grocery are choices for items they carry. The shelves stock limited choices of an item. Whereas the Super WM has more shelf space and a better variety of choices. And the prices here are slightly higher on some items. One thumb down.\n\nThis shopping trip was easy peazy! Cashier was pleasant and rang me up and I was outta there with my cart load of groceries in less than 20 minutes. No lines no crowds and even the parking lot was stress free. Thanks Daniel S.  for suggesting this place! Im adding it on my grocery store go-to list.
