I came in because I saw soups on the sign but I didn't see any offered inside, kind of a buzz kill. As far as the enchilada goes I found it to be tasty and inventive dish but it kind of loses it's appeal when it is assembled like a Pontiac. \n\nBut when these things come out of the paint booth the perfectly browned cheese is quite attractive and then you can customize the exterior to your tastes. The only main enchilada ingredient they offered that I really had any interest in was the buffalo. Since I had already decided to blow my entire non-dairy, no-animal thing I thought bison does bring nutritional benefit and hay, if I'm gonna cheese it up, may as well go all in. So no soup, no bison, I'm bummed.\n\nI ended up splitting two enchiladas, one potato and a spinach-mushroom, both were a good choice. The food is good but I wish they had some salt shakers on the table. The guy saucing our enchiladas was making a big deal about the heat from the habenero sauce and I said, pile it on but after tasting it I can't see why it couldn't second as a cooling salve for heat rash. Again, salt shakers would wake it up but admire and applaud their season to tastability product that can let the diner make it perfect. All the ingredients are fresh and tasty, even the hab sauce. \n\nToo bad they can't come up with a sliced jicama enchilada in lieu of tortillas for those of us wanting to get our veg freak on. As far as the meats, two high school kids thought they were the best they had ever had, maybe it's a kid thing.
