This review is long overdue, but just can't forget the bad experience I had here!\n\nI had $200 in cash. What I wanted was $100 to go toward my credit card and to exchange the other $100 bill for $20s. Sounds simple enough, right? Apparently not! The teller (wish I remembered her name) took the first $100 bill, processed the payment and printed out the receipt. Then, another employee comes up to her and asks if she saw a cashier's check \"lying around somewhere.\" She looks around her area and tells him no. Then she takes my other $100 bill, puts it in her drawer and asks \"is there anything else I can help you with?\"\nMe: \"Ummm, I'm waiting for my $20 bills for the other $100 bill I gave you....\"\nHer: \"Didn't you only give me a $100?\"\nMe: \"No, I gave you two $100 bills.\"\nHer: \"Did you really?\"\n\nSo she calls her manager over and tells her what happened. Then she said \"I got distracted because ______ interrupted me and asked me a question.\" The manager tells her to count her drawer. Just great. So I have to stand there waiting for another 10 minutes because she didn't do her job. BS I tell you! When she was done, she laughed and said \"Oh, you were right.\" Duh!! Seriously, WTF?!?! If you can't multi-task and\/or pay attention to what you customers are giving you, maybe you SHOULD NOT be a teller?!?!\n\nI did complain to Wells Fargo over the phone about the incident, but who knows if that even did anything. Ugh....never again!
