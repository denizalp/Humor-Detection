\"If you like Pina Coladas\", best to move on from this review...\n\nIf, on the other hand, you want simply the best pool company in LV to build your pool, this should convince you...\n\nI contracted with Desert Springs Pools ( DSP) early Feb., 2016....contracts signed \/down payments for pool, landscaping, outdoor kitchen and patio cover. (Paul @ DSP is, after all, THEMAN)...and he was my mentor for this whole process...\n\nI received final inspection Late Sept., 2016.\n\nYikes. (Thought I'd be swimming by 4th of July)\n\nNOT.\n\nBut it was my fault, not theirs...Hard to believe I built 5 houses in Florida...but never a pool like this one...\n\nRule #1) Do Not go to your HOA or community planning commission for approval, and then change your mind on the design.\n\nRule #2) Do Not ignore Rule #1\n\nI did, and thought I'd get away with it...Nope, had to go thru all approval cycle again.\n\nAnd TheBigDig started 5\/04\/16.\n\nHappy for a day. And then they hit PayDirt ( a.k.a. caliche...means \n\" get out your checkbook, wise guy\")\n\nMeans I had to pay a bit more...Use your imagination, and \" Google\" Caliche...you'll understand...\n\nCindy @ DSP talked me off-the-ledge, and work progressed. \n\nWhen I say \" work progressed\", don' t think for a minute this was a slam-dunk...\n\nPerhaps I should have stated this earlier, but this whole project entailed elaborate design to accommodate an incredible pool, spa, water features, fire bowls, decking, landscaping, lighting, a swim-up bar, an outdoor kitchen and a patio cover (that my little house should have had at the outset).\n\nBut I digress.\n\nSo here comes Dan-I-Can ( do pretty much anything) Construction Superintendent, gives me a projected schedule, and order of completion, and once again I am pretty sure we are still on schedule for mid-July.\n\nExcept.\n\nSchool's out, 100+ other customers want their pool built in time for Summer, and The Swim-Up bar is giving everyone...from concrete-to-design...HEADACHES.\n\nPlease don't misread my intentions. Pretty much every Caribbean Hotel Resort pool I've been to has a swim-up bar, so why not me? I mean, can it really be that difficult?\n\nI mean, ForAFewDollarsMore, could Clint Eastwood and LeeVan Cleef been so wrong?\n\nMaybe I watched a few too many westerns in my day, but more likely I was just too stubborn to realize that concrete bar-stools + swim up bar service area are just not everyday Las Vegas pool fixtures...\n\nSo, back to the drawing board...and with a little help from Dan and Paul, and my Craftsman tape measure, we got it all worked out...\n\nAnd I'm still thinking August 1st is looking pretty good...\n\nWell, at least If tearing out all your front yard landscaping and removing the concrete block wall ( we all find incredibly necessary here in LV to protect us from our neighbors) to access the back yard doesn't bother you.\n\nAnd never underestimate the resiliency of a bunch of scorpions...their homes desecrated by making a big hole in their living room, and filling it with concrete, who decided they'd just as soon move in to my house...\n\nAnyways, The Plot Thickens.\n\nJust when I thought it was safe to go back in the water...well, there was still no water...\n\nPool, Spa, and enough equipment to provide electricity and water to a few square blocks surrounding my house all in place...and here comes the landscapers, the patio cover guys and the guy responsible for \n\" constructing\" my outdoor kitchen\/barbecue...who looked to me just like TheMarlboroMan. His name is Andy, and he is a magician when it comes to \" fit and finish\"\n\nWell, August is gone...But Labor Day now looking real good...and the LV Valley heat spiking up...I'm getting pretty excited!\n\nHmmmmmmn, time to hold your horses...because the pool construction has to be inspected, and you better plan on being there the whole day for a process which takes all of 5 minutes...\n\nFortunately, by now the combination of Cindy and her sister Terry have kept my blood pressure from skyrocketing to the point of an emergency room visit, and Dan @ BBQ Island Creations, Jason @ Desert Springs Landscaping and TrickyRickie and his patio covers have all amped up their customer service skills.\n\nSeptember 15 is just around the corner, and PoolSkool Ajay and \nFireBowl Kevin are busy putting the finishing touches on things...\n\nSo, here we are, late September , and YES...it's all done!\n\nFinal inspections, Gas Company out, and sure, I jumped in just because I could....\n\nCold? Yeah, but I'll fire-up that spa real soon.\n\nIn the meantime, if Y.O.U. want to hire the best pool company in Las Vegas to build your dream come true...and you want to enjoy a full 2017 swim season...\n\nDo me a favor.\n\nCall 702-452-5900 today.\n\nAsk for Paul.\n\nHe'll make it happen.\n\nAnd if I can help, call me...Kevin @ 850-687-3128 ( cell)\n\nI'll send you pictures of the finished product...
