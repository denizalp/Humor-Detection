In preparation for a dinner at Chocolate, I read several reviews in hopes of getting a glimpse into where I was dining. I wish I had allowed the negative reviews to hold water. \n\nThere is one item that was great at Chocolate; the drinks. I do believe they pour the liqueur with a heavy hand in hopes that one will be too relaxed to care about the rest of the experience. \n\nThe food was not good. The mac-n-cheese that other reviewers raved about was mediocre at best. Everyone makes good mac-n-cheese at home. If it is on a menu, it needs to be superior. Don't offer me a prosciutto add-on and sneak in a different ham-like product. \n\nAt one point our waitress took the Parmesan cheese and pepper flakes off our table and gave them to another table, without asking if we were finished using them. Interesting approach to customer service. \n\nThe dessert of selected shooters was not impressive. Nicely presented, but no flavor. I suppose if I was only going to look at the desserts I would have been happy. \n\nOur bill came only after I sought out the manager to print the ticket. I had to explain that 2 hours for a basic meal, not fine dining, was a bit much. \n\nOverall, not impressed.
