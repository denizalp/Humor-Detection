This is a beautiful, natural outdoor music venue. The entire area is a wooded and lush and green. We came here to see Dave Matthews Band from the lawn and had a great time. The overall sound quality is pretty well balanced and decently loud. I can always go a little louder, but it wasn't bad at all. \n\nPro-tip 1: wear sneakers or flipflops that you don't care about because if it's rainy or has rained recently, you're going to be trooping through tons of mud and wet grass to get back to your car. \n\nPro-tip 2: park close to the entrance, not near the venue itself. Yes, you'll have to walk farther, but you also won't be sitting in traffic for nearly as long. \n\nPro-tip 3: bring a cooler with... beverages. There are a ton of people tailgating and having a blast. Bring enough to share and make friends!\n\nPro-tip 4: bring musical instruments! Even if *you* can't play, someone in the parking lot probably does and that is super fun.\n\nPro-tip 5: ladies, I know you have a giant purse, don't even lie to me. Toss a small thing of toilet paper in there. The \"bathrooms\" we're pretty gross and ran out of toilet paper about halfway through the show. You'll thank me later. You may even end up peeing in the woods, you wouldn't be the first one. \n\nAnd lastly, Pro-tip 6: bring cash. You know you'll want to buy some cool band merch and having cash makes everything smoother and quicker. \n\nEnjoy!
