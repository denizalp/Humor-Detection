I stumbled across Arizona Blinds while shopping for some new wood shutters for my home.  I had seen a specific brand of shutters (Biltmore) that I was interested in and Arizona Blinds was listed as a Biltmore retailer so I gave them a call to schedule a measurement appointment.\n\nMy sales associate, Matt, was very friendly and helpful.  He asked me a lot of questions to best understand my specific needs and presented several different options for me to consider.\n\nIn particular, Matt showed me another manufacturer's product that he felt was equal in quality to the BIltmore product I had initially selected but that was considerably less expensive due to a volume agreement that AZ Blinds had with said mfr.   I ended up choosing that product and was really happy with the product and the cost.\n\nArizona Blinds was very cost competitive compared to other vendors (and actually were the least expensive folks I spoke to) and their service was excellent.  They don't charge extra for things like painting blinds to match baseboards or wall color and provide a great warranty in case of any issues post installation.\n\nI would highly recommend Arizona Blinds to everyone considering real wood shutters.  They also have a great Web site with lots of good information and customer testimonials.  I'm very surprised that I am the first person to review them given their popularity and that they've been around for a while.
