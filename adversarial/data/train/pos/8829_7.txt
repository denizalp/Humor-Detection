After passing by this place several times, finally stopped in with a few friends.\n\nA very nice and quaint beer pub. There is ample seating inside as well as outside seating. There are flat screen TV's around the bar area and in the seating area. It is a great place to watch a football or hockey game.\n\nThe service was exceptional. There is an ample amount of bar staff ready to serve you. The owner Dave is hanging around and very willing to chat you up about beer or the Ale House. The bartenders are very knowledgable about the beers on tap.\n\nThe selection is quite good. There are at least 30 beers on tap, including many new releases and seasonal beers. They do have some botles available as well.  Many types of beer styles on tap, many rotating.\n\nThere is a more than ample menu with a lot of interesting food selections. I have only eaten there once, and the burger I had was alright, but there are a lot more items to choose from.\n\nOverall, this place is a really nice place if you are in the Wexford\/Cranberry Area. The bar is crowded, but not overly crowded, seats are available with little to no wait. The service is exceptional. The prices are MORE than reasonable including happy hour prices of 1\/2 off drafts. When Happy Hour is not in session, most draft beers are $5.00 with some higher priced beers which is usually based on ABV. \n\nIf you are in the North Hills and looking for a place with a really nice selection of craft beers, this is a great place to stop.
