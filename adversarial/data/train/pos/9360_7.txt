I went to the Ross Park Mall to get some dress shirts and a tie.\nI started at Nordstrom as it was the closest.\nI wandered around for about 15 minutes before I found a sales person.\nThere are not many sales people around so good luck finding one.\nAs I said I did find a sales person finally and told him the size I needed.\nHe showed me the only one that was correct size and it was $125 for one shirt????\nI asked what was the sale price as all the other stores had big sales.\nThe salesman said it was not onsite and it was $125.00.\nAre you Freakin riding me $125 for a dress shirt?????????\nI needed 3 of them no way was i spending that kind of money on a dress shirt.\nI found the prices to be high and finding a sales person to help very hard.\nI would not go back again to Nordstrom at all for any reason.\nYou are better off going to Macys where there are always sales and all sorts of other discounts.
