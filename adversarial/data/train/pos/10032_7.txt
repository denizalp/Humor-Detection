Stopped in for a quick lunch while running errands in the plaza and notice this new place and so decided to check out if they have an a la carte menu. They did. The server gave me their folded printed menu (same as their take out menu).   And while I looked thru one of the servers pointed out to me that the daily and lunch specials on the back of the menu.  And on that same page I notice they also put \"15% off. For any purchase with us! Cash only. Expiry date will be informed in advance\".   The food was okay, not great. And so when they gave me the bill I asked for the 15% off as I will pay cash.  The server then told me that the discount special does not apply to the daily and lunch specials. I asked if it is expired they did not say so before \"in advance\". She said \"no\" it does not apply to the specials. WHAT!!! The same specials that is printed on the same page just above the 15% off notice does not apply.  I pointed out to them that it does not say that on the menu. So I just paid my bill and walked out. Not worth arguing over the stupidness of how they plan their printing as I do not plan to return to this place.   How do I add a picture to this review so you can see their menu.
