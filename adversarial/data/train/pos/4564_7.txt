Nice place located in a surrounding county of charlotte. There is a good amount of parking and a quite a large vineyard. Great place to go to for a day trip.I came to wine tasting only. Apparently they host events like weddings, etc there. They have a wide range of wines from dry, semi sweet to sweet, and slushes. The slushees were great for a hot summer day. I like that they offer a variety and some of the wines were quite tasty. They have a Groupon for their establishment if your looking for a deal. The only concerns were that the wine tasting section is tiny and there is a strong stomach turning stench in the front of the home near the entrance where you come in at for the gift shop. I'm\nNot sure if it's the plumbing or what., but Other then that it's a nice place. Happy drinking.
