There is nothing I can really say about this place that hasn't been said. The owners remember our dog by name, and remember that it's actually my girlfriend who is the name on our loyalty purchase thingy. Going in, we're so often treated to bags of samples - so much so that we once went in to buy food and left with nothing but samples, and didn't need to return for a week to actually purchase any. \n\nThe staff is extremely helpful, and willing to answer any questions you might have about any of their products, or make recommendations based on your pet's lifestyle. They also have no problem cleaning up a bit of doggy accident, if someone can't hold it until you leave. \n\nThe place is primarily a dog store, with about 70-80% of the merchandise dedicated to canine companions, but they do also have a small mammals section for cats and such. They are also home to several events throughout the months(Especially great for the owners of well socialized dogs, which ours is not quite good enough to partake just yet), so be sure to follow them on Facebook or twitter.
