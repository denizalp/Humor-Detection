Police should never be at Chuck E. Cheese.\nBut on the night I was tricked into going, they were.\nMy mom conveniently forgot to mention after my brother and I agreed to have dinner with her that she has also invited her friend and her three children under 10.  \nShe also forgets to mention that we're going to Chuck E. Cheese.\nI've never seen so many unattended children in my life. Running here, flinging pizza there, spilling soda and screeching like possessed little demons on satan's playground. \nThen I see some unruly dad starting a fight with another dad. WTF people! This is Chuck E. Cheese! Dads fight at Chuck E. Cheese? Is nothing sacred anymore?  \nLong story short, the police were called, the dads were tossed out and I decided that this location had to be the most ghetto Chuck E. Cheese in the world. \nAnd it was a little dirty. Things just didn't seem clean. \nBut on a lighter note, the creepy robot animals actually put on a nice show and the pizza, although thin, really wasn't that bad.\nBut just so we're clear, I will never, ever go back.
