I have been here four times & I would have to say my rating is consistent with each time I have been here. I believe the security guards are constantly on a high horse & arrogant... and I hate to say it, but the constant reviews regarding racism are true. I've experienced them first hand (whether they don't want to let you in, give my friends a hard time, or witnessing other groups harassed -- for no reason) and it's a shame, because that sets the tone of the place since it's the first part you have to deal with. And just like everyone else mentions, THE CUSTOMER SERVICE IS ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE. Truly.\n\nThe plus sides? This place has a nice, chill ambiance... often described as a \"mini Gold Spike,\" has the laid back atmosphere with a lot of games like corn hole, beer pong, darts, billiards, bowling, giant Jenga, etc. Located on 215 & Flamingo so it's away from the downtown chaos and usually has a good amount of people there. The drinks are cheap, food very reasonably priced... Not a place I would choose personally; If it weren't for my friends picking it due to it being close by, I would never go out of my way.
