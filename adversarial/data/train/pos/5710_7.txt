Been here twice in one week. \nIt's great to have another supermarket here aside from Publix.\nSo let the competition begin.\n\nWhat I like about this particular Harris Teeter is their Food Court area which is like huge. Lots of options for take out on the go and especially for nights you just do not want to cook.\n\nNice selection of wines.\n\nPrice are a bit more compared to Publix. Only dollar difference with apple pie $4.99 versus $3.99 for Thanksgiving week at Publix. \n\nWill be back again just for the prepared food.
