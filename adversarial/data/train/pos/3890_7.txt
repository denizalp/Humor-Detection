My BFF and I played hookie today to lunch it up. As always the food is out of this world good. In fact, during desert, she actually schooshed me, because she was having a moment with the tiramisu. Normally I wouldn't add this sort of thing to a review, but seriously... she schooshed me! \n\nPAM will now be open from noon to 8:30 on Sundays. They are staffing up for the opening of their Scottsdale location and the place is all a buzz. Although you can generally get in with little or no wait during lunch, you would be smart to call ahead or make a reservation for dinner. Also their liquor license is in process, but you can still BYO.
