One star for poor customer service! So I booked this hotel for my wedding night through Expedia. Then my friend, who owns a concierge business booked a room to get us a upgrade and told me to cancel the other reservation. Well the other reservation I made had to be cancelled on writing so I did so. Unfortunately they would not accommodate my request and still charged me. I ended up paying double for my one night stay here. After attempting multiple times and speaking with several different managers at the property, I was told there was nothing they could do. I paid DOUBLE for my room for my wedding night...and they won't do ANYTHING?! I understand they can't provide a refund and I didn't even request that but given the fact that they made DOUBLE on my one night stay, the least they could do is offer some sort of hotel credit or something. Next time, it will be Sanctuary or one of the other beautiful resorts we have here in town. Thanks for nothing. \n\nAnd in response to your response, Courtney--not an excuse. You guys still got paid double. That's the bottom line.
