菜品还不错 菜码也很实惠 环境很好 是我见过匹兹堡最大的中餐馆了 菜单菜品跟府河很类似 上菜速度也还可以 总体来说是还算是不错的\nThe food is really tasty, atmosphere is nice. It's probably the largest Chinese restaurant in Pittsburgh. Overall this place is not bad.\n\n给一星的原因是服务态度需要调整一下\nThe reason why I rated 1 Star is because the service attitude.\n\n我们一行人八点半开始用餐 餐厅九点半关门 我们吃到9:34分已经吃得差不多准备走了 我们也是想快些吃 不想耽误餐厅员工下班 但是服务员频繁过来看我们吃没吃完 提前过来收盘子真的很影响就餐心情\nWe arrived at 8:30pm and we know the restaurant closed at 9:30pm. So we ate fast because we didn't want to delay the time of close. We finished at 9:34pm and we were about to leave. However the waitress kept checking if we were done and kept taking empty plates away one by one while we were still eating. That's really annoying.\n\n我能理解服务员想按时下班的心情 但是我在匹兹堡其他餐馆吃饭 就算在关门前十分钟开始入座就餐 服务员也会一直耐心等到用餐结束 而不会频繁地过来收盘子 在旁边一直看着我们等着擦桌子\nI understand that she wants to get off work on time, but in other restaurants in Pitt, even we go in 10 mins before they close, the waitress will still serve us patiently, rather than keep checking on us and keep taking empty plates away often. I mean you could tell we were leaving in a few minutes, u just can't wait for 3 mins?\n\n这次小费依然给的20%  但以后应该不会再来光顾了 希望能提高服务员基本素质\nWe still left 20% tip, but personally I will not come back to this place again.\n\nThe food is tasty and atmosphere is great, just dine in here early in a day rather than right before they close.
