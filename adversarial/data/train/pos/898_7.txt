Rex has moved. Rex has been moved. Rex has been forcibly relocated at gun point. All long stories.  Recently I voluntarily moved. It should have been a better experience than walking down a narrow gangplank with a baton shoved in your back. Unfortunately...it wasn't. The experience was a total mess.\n\nI moved my from somewhere in the Southwest to Las Vegas. It should have been an easy move.  It should have been painless.  It should have been easy. The estimated time was 10 business days. It was longer than that.  Then to add to the misery the tell me that they lost a large piece of furniture. They have no idea where it is.  It is a huge piece and there is no way it could be lost. Well, it was.  Suddenly...and I am not accusing anyone of anything...but you be the judge.  When told that I had taken pictures of all the large furniture that I had moved and pictures of it going onto the truck...in less than an hour it was found.  Then they told be because it was found so late in the day it couldn't be there until Tuesday because they are off on Sunday and Monday.  So I didn't get my furniture until Saturday when I wasn't at my...um...job.\n\nThis is the best part. When I complained...and anyone would...the \"Customer Service Manager\" was rude and dismissive. She at one point said...and you will LOVE this...\"Don't disrespect Customer Service.\"  HUH?  Is she referring to herself in the third person as \"Customer Service\"?  That doesn't even make sense? Is she warning me not to disrespect the concept of Customer Service? Now I want you to forget the fact that a \"manager\" said the word \"disrespect\" in a professional setting. That is a whole other ball of inept wax. No, I want to think about the sentence \"don't disrespect customer service\" and think about that sentence when you think about moving with these morons.\n\nI know what you are thinking...Rex you sex bastard...that can't be it. Oh...you know me too well. When I laughed at the moronic \"manager\" I asked if I could talk to her supervisor...hopefully someone who didn't say \"disrespect\" and she told me that she had no boss, no one to answer to and only the owner was above her.  Here is the worst part...I BELIEVE IT! Only a company this inept could have her as a \"manager.\" Only a company this horrible could hire her.\n\nThe only star is for the delivery guys who did a little more than a horrible job picking up the furniture. The three people who delivered the furniture couldn't have cared less about quality or the fact that my furniture was missing. \n\nRex thought about closing the front door and showing them how we do things on the cell block...but civilization and an ankle bracelet that goes off when i am out in the desert digging a hole for too long made me rethink it. \n\nIf you hate your life, your possessions and your self-respect then I suggest this horrible company for you. You sound sad enough to like it. Like when the hooker rubs her heel on your tongue. It burns. It makes you feel bad...and you like it.
