Terrible brief experience. Restaurant was pretty empty. Music was blaring. Manager wasn't lowering it. Asked to see manager several times to no avail. While waiting for manager a mouse ran by several times.  We walked out and passed the manager on our way out. Can't imagine if it were busy. Also assumed that mouse was headed to the buffet!!!
