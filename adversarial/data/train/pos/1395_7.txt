This place is a crapshoot.....sometimes you can go through the line with no problems, sometimes you wait in a long line. Sometimes you get nice people helping you, sometimes they won't even crack a smile. Sometimes you get a fresh, fluffy bagel, sometimes you get one that you gnaw at so hard you think your teeth are going to fall out. Sometimes they get your order right, sometimes they don't Unfortunately, the latter has been happening more frequently than I like so I only foresee myself heading back there (if that at all) if I get one of their coupons in the mail
