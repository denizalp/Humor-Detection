I had high expectations for this place. I only make gumbo once a year, on New Years Day, and I was hoping this would satisfy my cravings in the interim. I ordered gumbo, white bean chili, and beignets. The gumbo tasted like the roux was bad, it had a slightly burnt, bitter taste to it. It was really thin and I had 4 pieces of sausage in it, a lot of rice, and not much else. The white bean chili was okay, nothing to write home about but much better than the gumbo. And the beignets might have been okay but I gave them to my daughter. I was too put off by the fact that there was more powdered sugar than dough, and it was everywhere in the bag. I'll deal with the casino smoke and stick to the Oyster bar at Palace Station.
