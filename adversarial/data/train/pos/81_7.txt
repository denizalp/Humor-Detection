So hyped up, but damn that was the WORST service I've received in a long time. \n\nSeriously, the shitty service was on a whole new level, considering ayce. (Ironic, for all those trolls laughing at the 'kaka' name)\n\nPros: \n- menu variety, certainly different from your usual joints \n- blow-torched sushi! \n- thick, quality sashimi cuts \n- desserts; must try the ganache, matcha creme brulee, mango lychee slush, spring egg\n-lamb skewers\n\nCons:\n- super tiny and cramped\n- (almost non-existent) service \n- we had dirty dishes on our table the whole night; as did all the tables around us\n- MANY forgotten items\n- dirty & chipped dinnerware\n- the already slipping in quality (at less than 6 months old establishment)\n\nThe food is better, than your average ayce sushi joint - it almost justifies the pretty buck you're paying. \n\nDEFINITELY call ahead and book a reservation. Even on a Monday night, they were turning people away at the door. If you are a walk-in, you'll be told to try after 9. \nHowever, mind you, last call is at 10:30, 8ish pm reservations have their '2 hour window' ending around 10; you're pretty much hoping someone finishes early.\n\nThey've only recently opened, and it's a shame that their standards have already started slipping.\nThe fish on the pressed sushi was super thin, where you could only taste rice. \n(Most) servers ignore all the dirty dishes piling up at every table. We spent our dinner playing tetris &  Jenga, trying to keep our stack from falling. \nOne of our desserts came in a shattered glass.. You could feel the cracks even on the inside. I can't imagine, if someone had actually gotten shards of glass in their mouth. \nWe were constantly reordering; in the midst of all the FORGOTTEN orders, we had items that were 'sold out', and no one bothered communicating to us until the third server we came across. \n\nWould I be eager to come back? I don't think the torched sushi and desserts are enough to have me running back, knowing the service would make a terrible night.
