First off, my friend and I arrived ten minutes early for the 11:15 appointment. The front staff harassed us several times about \"being on time\" and their \"late policy\" as if we could not comprehend what they were saying. They put my name, phone numbers, and email wrong in the computer system and blamed me for their mistake. Talk about great customer service for my first experience at this European Wax Center.\n\nSecond, they finally called me back to my Brazilian appointment after having to wait 10 minutes past my appointment time. The lady was nice and made me comfortable, but when you say \"Brazilian\" you're supposed to be completely bare, right? WRONG. Not at European Wax Center. She didn't even remove all the hairs, and not just the baby hairs, but thick, coarse hair that definitely should have been removed. There was wax still left all over the area and wax was even on my shirt.\n\nFinally, when I went to pay at the counter, they practically FORCED me to buy their products and harassed me until I finally gave in to buy a serum. Then, they continued to push the packages on me. Luckily since this was my first service, the Brazilian was half off. \n\nNeedless to say, I will NEVER be coming back to European Wax Center. I would much rather get my money's worth on a Brazilian.
