Sun Valley Guttering (David & Gina Herre owner operators) installed gutters on our home (2800 sq. ft) + our full 3 car garage (=more sq. ft) 3 years ago.  Beginning with the 1st rainfall & for 2 1\/2 years we had numerous issues with water spilling over the existing guttering, pouring off each end of a patio roof that should have had gutters and over several splash guards that were placed at intersecting roof angles.   Each time I called for service (spoke with Gina) I was put off \"until they would be in the area next\", often times weeks later, many times not showing up at all.  Finally, after being told there would be a \"service call charge\" during the 1st year it was clear they would not be standing behind their promise of quality workmanship & customer service.\n \nAfter contacting competitors we were told the gutters were sized much too small for the size of the roofline and volume of water and there should have been gutters placed on either end of the patio roof, not just along the length & the splash guards were undersized as well.  Immediately after we had them re-done correctly the problems ceased.\n\nAll told, what we paid for with Sun Valley Guttering was inadequate for our home and not properly done at that.  Thinking back; the rapid installation (less than 1 hour total) & ensuing problems created from their poor workmanship along with the lack of servicing or standing behind their work all raise major red flags; buyer beware.
