This place is so convenient. I may be biased because it's super close to my house, but that's beside the point. I've tried many of their menu items and have never been disappointed (Banh Mi is still my favorite, and they have great brunch options).\n\nI am here today to let you in on a very important and top secret life hack. The prepared food section. I used to marinate chicken, cook it, and slice it up to add to salads, wraps, etc for lunches throughout the week. Since I have discovered the spicy chicken skewers that they sell - not sure if that's the proper name - it really has changed my entire life! Is that dramatic? No. They are cheap (2-3 skewers will run you $8), the chicken is way better than anything I've ever made, and it comes with this AMAZING jalepeno crema on the side. I don't know (nor do I want to know) what's in that sauce but it is so good. I never want to go back to cooking my own chicken. I can't and I won't.
