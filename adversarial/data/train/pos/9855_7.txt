Let me start off by saying tanning is bad.  We all know the risks and that SPF should be our best friend.\n\nHowever, sometimes you just want that sunkissed glow.  Especially if it's March in Northeast Ohio and you're heading to Las Vegas with your girlfriends.  That's where Skin Deep Mega Tanning comes in.\n\nIf you want a tanning experience that's straight out of \"Jersey Shore,\" by all means, sign up.  The staff was too-cool-for-school and never tried to learn my name during the month that I came in at least three times a week.  On the up side, the beds were new and clean and there was always a special going on.\n\nMoral of the story - if you're going to go tanning and you're looking for a decent deal, head to Skin Deep Mega Tanning.  If you want the staff to be friendly and not leave with the feeling that they're talking about you the second you shut the door, definitely go somewhere else.
