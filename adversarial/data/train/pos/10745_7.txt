I really, really like breakfast food. That being said, it's really, really hard to find good breakfast food.\n\nI heard about these pancakes at Du-Par's and I had to see what I was missing. Well, I won't keep you in suspence... they're GREAT! =)\n\nI ordered the full stack. Not because I was super hungry, but because the price differential between the short stack and the full stack was so inconsequential, I didn't see the point of bothering with the smaller version. Well, these things are huge, so don't be a hero. I made it through less than half of my mountain of pancakes before throwing up the white flag. \n\nI was so tempted to finish that mo-fo up, but I just couldn't do it.  Next time, I'll share!    ;-)\n\nI need to go back and try some of the fresh baked pies as well. This place is a treat and definitely worth venturing downtown for.
