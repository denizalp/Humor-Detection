Okay the burger was good the service at the counter friendly BUT THEN IT GOT BIZARRE...Listen I understand striving to improve customer service...but this employee came over while we were eating and asked us if everything was good, WE said yes and then she just stood there looking at us and making us feel uncomfortable..THEN she asked what we ordered...okay so WTF we said burgers and then she stood glaring at us with a smile again...Hey if there are any bodies discovered around this Habit Burger Grill you may want to check out the psycho that works there. CREEPY! of course if the manager insist that is what she is suppose to do then get a new manager!
