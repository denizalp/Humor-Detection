I was craving grub after work, so decided to walk to the kfc around the corner. I knew this was going to be a chicken coop - small, crammed - yet a ridiculous line up. (Take away only). One of the customers was upset because she was served cold popcorn chicken, another mom of 2- sees her food and comments \"this isn't food anyone would feed the living!\" But points for the staff for trying to accomodate them both serving an extra slice of bread? Lol \n\nWhen it was my turn to order I picked the 5$ special with a chicken burrito- side of fries and popcorn chicken. Surprisingly, I came to know that they changed their fluorescent radioactive green coleslaw I loved eating (RIP coleslaw) so I went to my second go to - macaroni salad. Which all cost less than 8$. As I went to the fountain drink to get iced tea- the machine wouldn't stop spraying! And it wasn't even iced tea! But a mix of coke and orange crush! Somehow we got the crazy machine to stop. I saved a life or two lol \n\nDon't come here expecting service, a proper meal but a good story over fried piece of chicken!
