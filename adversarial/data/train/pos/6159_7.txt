I am usually too tired for brunch and can't get myself out of bed.  eat. is a good reason to get yourself up in the morning.  \n\nI got there 15 minutes after the breakfast menu ended but I was happy that the beignets were served all day.  Beignets with vanilla marscapone and homemade jelly?  Uhmmm yes please!\n\nI had the truffled egg sandwich which was omg good!  It is served with wild mushrooms, chives, feta cheese, and potatoes on ciabatta bread.  It was delicious.  It is like an elegant farm breakfast sandwich.  \n\nThe vibe here is hipster-y without being super pretentious.  I felt like I was in LA but you are actually in downtown LV haha.  This restaurant is a random escape from the grunge of downtown.  I have to give dtown credit though.  There are a lot of cool spots that I need to explore further.  It is like an up and coming neighborhood.  \n\nI was impressed by my beignets and egg sandwich.  I need to come back and get blown away a little more by eat.
