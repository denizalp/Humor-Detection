I instantly fell in love with Sip because of their wide open space, amazing patio, and fabulous decor. It makes you feel so warm and cozy inside! I came here for a quick bite and coffee with a girlfriend and we got exactly what we came for! :) My breakfast wasn't anything over-the-top special but lets be honest, they're known for their coffee and beverages! The coffee was delish and it really was just what the doctor ordered for us on this sunny Sunday morning. We sat and talked on their patio for a few hours. I saw a delicious looking bloody mary fly by and will most definitely be back to try one of those! I would also love to come back and work from here soon!
