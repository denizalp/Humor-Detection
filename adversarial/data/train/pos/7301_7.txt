After leaving the restaurant, I was pretty dead-set on giving this place a three-star rating.  But as the days passed, Mily & Lalo was on my mind...\n\nI can hear a faint whisper in the air: mi mi mi, ly ly ly... la la la, lo lo lo.  That's when the mescaline was in full effect.  But I had to have it... you see, I was craving the bread.  That delicious world-rockin' yucca bread.  It tastes like a donut.at.its.m-fing.core.  So good.  When you take a bite of it (and dip a piece in the spicy ambrosia-esque sauce), you'll know what I'm talking about.  Some say exaggeratiion reeks of sarcasm, this, my friends - the bread - smells of the truth.  Abandon religion - find the bread.\n\nCeviche's okay.\n\ndmo out
