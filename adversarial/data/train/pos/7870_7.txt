Fat Lush, Fat Idiot, Fat Mess, Fat Cow, Fat Tailgate...\n\nFat nasty!\n\nI wanted to like this place. I really did. The sandwich names sound good and greasy and I thought that if I was just perfectly, overly drunk, it would score. Nuh uh. Leave this place for the 2 a.m. State Street Brats crowd.\n\nThink of all your favorite guilty fried pleasures: jalapeno poppers, cheese curds, cheese sticks, chicken fingers, and pizza bites. They even have macaroni and cheese along with mini corndogs. Now, imagine all of these stuffed into a soft bun and topped off with a handful of cold, greasy fries. That's Fat Sandwich for ya! Amazingly, of the two sandwiches we tried, even with all that grease there was no flavor. I wanted to pull out the salt n pepper n hot sauce! \n\nI walked down State Street the next morning and shamefully eyed the darkened Fat Sandwich window. It was covered in greasy hand prints and names written in grease. Ugh. Fat Goodbye!
