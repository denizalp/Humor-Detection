We just used this company for the first time.  \n\nJesse was our cleaner, and he kicked ass!  \n\nI'm usually hesitant to use charge-by-the-hour cleaning services because I've been burned in the past by slow ladies who like to take too many smoke breaks, and move like they're swimming in marshmallow goo.  But Jesse jumped right in without chit chat.  He cleaned from top to bottom without wasting any time at all (no breaks on a 3-4 hour job).  He really knew what he was doing, and blew away my expectations. \n\nI think when it comes to something like housecleaning, many people have different expectations and preferences.  It's very difficult to please everyone.  Which may explain the poor reviews. \n\nWe will use this company again, and request Jesse every time.
