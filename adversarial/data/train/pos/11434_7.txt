I can spend an afternoon just browsing around here.. \n\nAl Premium is the newest and biggest supermarket opens by Orient Mart, which has 2 other locations. \n\nEverything is super sized here! Spacious aisles, high ceiling, dim lighting and huge selections of everything around the world!! \n\nFor their hot table, aside from the usual Chinese dishes they even have a separate area for Indian food prepared by Indian cooks!! \n\nThere is even a different area where you can get Halal meat. \n\nSeafood area is clean and smell fresh, and hope it will stay the same! \n\nSo many checkout lanes.. I don't even need to wait in line at all on their Opening Day! \n\nAmple Parking.... And TTC accessible! \n\nOpens daily from 8 am to 12 am! \n\nNow I need one up in Markham!!
