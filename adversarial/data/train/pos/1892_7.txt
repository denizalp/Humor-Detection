I would give this place 4 stars for the room alone because the beds are amazingly comfortable, they give you everything you need including a blowdryer, and it's just a warm, welcoming atmosphere from the moment you walk into the lobby and into the casino area.  Nice and spacious unlike New York, New York, which I can't stand.\n\nHowever, the customer service here is horrible!  I told my friends that these people are in the customer service industry and really should learn how to treat their guests.  The person at the registration desk was god awful.  She did not smile one bit, and even though we were here for a bachelorette party (which was pretty obvious since we were all wearing matching shirts and the bride to be was wearing a ridiculous feather boa), she was not accommodating at all.  We inquired about a room upgrade if possible but instead of even trying to check for us, she automatically responded with a curt NO.  Again, not even a smile or look of apology.  ::virtual slap::\n\nAnyway, our experience doesn't get much better.  The night before we checked out called concierge to see if we could request a late check out.  They said to call back in the morning cuz they won't know then abruptly hung up on us.  Uhhh is that how you treat your guests?  We called again in the morning and they responded with a curt NO and hung up on us again.\n\nMGM needs to do a staff overhaul and hire people who actually know something about customer service.
