Two of us for lunch on a Wednesday.\n\nMargherita pizza which was so mushy as to be inedible\nA greasy linguine dish paired with a mushy breaded chicken \nWay overpriced Caesar with what was clearly brought in dressing (i.e. not made on premises)\nMinestrone soup that my friend did like\n\nService was strange. Mains arrived while we were eating our appetizers...reaction to being told the meal was crap was a shrug...\n\nCertainly will not return.
