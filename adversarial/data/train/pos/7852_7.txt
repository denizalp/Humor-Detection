Sept. 2016:\nJust re-newed our lease!  Office staff has been great during our first year here.  Thank you Devon, Becca, Camary.  Also in my opinion and from what I've observed - Maintenance Sup Matt's work ethic is far greater than the previous guy Nestor or Nester.  Thank goodness I no longer have to see his eye sore Mercedes Benz parked at the front. \nOne thing to get out there to the guilty tenants, PLEASE stop leaving your old mattress next to the trash bins. Find a dump site, donate it just don't leave it next to the trash bins. \nBe responsible tenants and own it!!! \n\n\nNov. 2015:\nSo far so good. Elevation staff has been very helpful in providing us with pertinent info for our upcoming move to Elevation in November. Thank you\nUpdate: moved in at our new place.  Very pleased with it.  Looking forward for community calendar events to be integrated online.  Mgmt is attentive to tenants' needs. Their attitude is positive.  Hopefully stays that way.  Devon & Becca rocks!
