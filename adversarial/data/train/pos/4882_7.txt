This was a sad excuse for a \"food festival\"\n\nI feel bad for people that actually paid for this and bought the sample tickets. I decided on the free admission and was still disappointed! At MOST there were 12 trucks\/booths open. The options were basically BBQ & shaved ice.\n\nI was there on Saturday afternoon.
