I don't know what exactly gluten is, but clearly you don't need it to make some of the most scrumptious baked goods I've ever tasted.\n\nGoing off tips from fellow Yelpers, I first tried a brownie. It was so rich and fudgy delicious I wish I would have bought more than one.  Thank goodness I still had a gob to enjoy. I decided to go with the mint creamy filling - definitely the right choice.  The gob was even better than the brownie.  Lastly I tried the chocolate chip cookies, despite mixed reviews.  They weren't my favorite thing, but they were still better than I expecteded, walnuts included. My only criticism would be the cookies could have used more chocolate chips.  But even so, the cookie were big and soft and perfect with a glass of milk.\n\nI've recommended Gluttony to both vegan and meat-eating friends alike and I can't wait to go back myself.
