I am a college student at UNLV and my friends and I simply wanted to eat pizza. We placed an order around 1:45 and we were told it would be there at 2:15. My friend and I went down to the front of our dorm building waiting for an hour and no none showed up! I called in the store and the driver told me his driver was there ad said no one was there! My friend and I were standing in the front of our building looking for this car! As the manager had the nerve to talk down to me saying, \"maybe you should pick up your phone when we call you next time.\" Well fuck that guy. We had to wait another hour till our pizza arrived. Nothing against the pizza here, the pizza is not at fault. The incompetent fools working at this Pizza Hut. Never ordering from here again. Bless their incompetent managers heart.
