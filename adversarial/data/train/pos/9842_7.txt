WOWZERS!!!!! \n\nThis is one of the many words that came from my mouth when I saw this show along with Omg, that's amazing, and again WOOOW! \n\nI LOVE LOVE LOVE this show! \n\nI have seen ALL of the Las Vegas Cirque shows and KA is by far my favorite of all time!!! \n\nAction packed, breathless stunts, The props were amazing, I felt like I was watching a video game when looking at some of the scenes and characters movements! \n\nThe costumes were so unique and detailed, the choreography was amazing, I mean the show was like being in a dream! The moving and rotating stage is one of a kind. \n\nGreat show for the whole family! \n\nIf you want to see a Cirque show and can't decide which one you want to see I advise you to see KA I promise you will not leave disappointed! \n\nA must see! I see a lot of well deserving 5 star reviews as it should be for this exceptional show! Anyone that gives this show less than needs to have their head examined in MY opinion!
