If you need a brake from the strip you should stop in at Ethel M Chocolate Factory. There is a free walk through tour of their facility, as well as a cactus garden, an M&M world shop, and the Ethel M chocolate shop. \n\nNow if you are looking for some grand tour for free then go somewhere else, you'll be disappointed by this place. On the other hand, if you are looking for a little pit stop that is cute and off the beaten path then this is a good little place to hit. Personally I am one of those people who love watching people make food and candy and those sorts of things, so being able to see this was fun. The whole stop will probably take you about 30 minutes to an hour depending on how much you mosey in the cactus garden, which apparently they decorate for christmas, which is a nice idea. \n\nThey also give out free samples of the chocolate, which is a nice little treat.
