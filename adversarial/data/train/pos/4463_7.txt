I had my twins there since they were 18 months old.  They used to go part time until they went to preschool.  The preschool program is amazing and Mrs. Bates is the best teacher.  To this date, my little girl still wants to go visit Mrs. Bates to her old school.  I loved that they had very few days off, unlike regular schools or other places that close all the time.
