An authentic french place in the heart of the plateau.  My friends decided to get engaged here, in front of us! I lost track of everything after that. I remember something about pickles in a jar brought to the table. Something about some really great wine. And I've heard good things about the steak frites.  Not super easy for vegetarians to find things to eat. (See aforementioned bone marrow review!) \nLovely setting, though. Service is impeccable.
