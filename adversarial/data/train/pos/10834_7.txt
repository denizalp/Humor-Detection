This is for all of you people who live under a rock and do not know what In N Out burger is. It's delicious.\n\nI would end the review there but let's do this. This location is located right off the strip and should be the first destination when landing in Las Vegas. \n\nI typically get a single burger animal style with fries animal style with a strawberry shake. Why the animal style you say? BECAUSE IT'S LEGIT! Go to in n out's website to find out all the different styles out there. Go in. Try it and if you didn't know to try it. NOW YOU KNOW.
