This is my favorite sports bar in Charlotte.  I'm probably a little biased since I live in the neighborhood, but I really haven't found a better one in my 4+ years here.\n\nI don't feel like I need to explain much.  They have a solid selection of cold beer and great bar food.  I'm looking for burgers and wings at a sports bar and they do both well.\n\nThey have a really cozy atmosphere with that sleek dark wood interior that I'm a huge fan of.  The guys working the bar have all been really friendly as well.  This is everything I look for in a neighborhood bar.
