****CASH ONLY?**** SERIOUSLY? you got to be kiddin' me!\nI took my family here today as I wanted to introduce them to Vietnamese cuisine, pho and the likes. I read the reviews and I thought it would be a great place to break them into this food.\nSo yes, the PHO is not bad at all, I had better but really, we had the one with tofu and the one with rare meat and they were good. the noodles are thick and fresh and size is good.\nwe also had the fried chicken with rice which was average at best + the spring rolls which were ok. So all in all the food was fine and I would probably give it a 3 or even 4 stars.\nBUT...\nwhen going to pay I was pulling out my debit card and was told no way! cash only!!! Didn't you see the little piece of paper on the door? you have no cash? it's ok, we have a machine downstairs that would cost me another $3.50 or so. \nFurthermore, they made a mistake sending us a juice that we didnt order and when I said I didnt order it they refused to take it off the bill.\nNeedless to say I was completely ticked off by then and just wanted to leave. NOT HAPPY.\n\nCommon, it is 2016 and 99% of people do not carry cash on them! nevermind it's about 15 cents per transaction. \nThe only reason they dont take cards is because the owners of this restaurant either skip the cash register and keep most of cash without paying taxes or they just want to make an extra $2 from the money machine downstairs. \nThat is not the kind of restaurant I want to give business to.
