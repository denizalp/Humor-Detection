Great wednesday night specials, of .25 cent beer and well drinks! Decent size dance floor and the music varies from Hip-Hop to Country.  Large outside smoking section of the bar with some swamp coolers to try and keep the heat down. If you go on a Wednesday make sure to get there before 8:30 or there will be a line. Def. worth checking out!\n\noh and def hit the 2 for 5$ shot lady up that walks around! Always a good deal :)
