This is the first place I ever walked out on... My girlfriend and I ordered a few things and noticed little fruit flies flying around... I lost my appetite as soon as a couple landed on my food.. I showed our waiter (young gentlemen) the issue, and he knew exactly what was going on so he notified a manager.. The manager comes we show her the little fruit fly and tells my girlfriend \"oh that's just garlic honey\" are you kidding me?? When does garlic move?? Anyways this place is ridiculous I also ordered a boba drink and the boba was rock hard. Also I feel bad for the young waiter who had to act like nothing was wrong because in sure the manager told him to act like it
