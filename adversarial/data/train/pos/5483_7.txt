There may be more than one GAB in the CLT airport (I think there's another in the D concourse) but my review is for the one in the B concourse. It is located between the B7 and B9 gates.\n\nAt 6:00 AM, they had a great selection of bagels and because this terminal doesn't start rocking for another 45 minutes or so, there was no wait for my order or at the cashier.\n\nI ordered a cheddar herb bagel, toasted, with egg and cheddar cheese. Nice and warm, but maybe it could have gone through the toaster a second time?\n\nCoffee choices seemed limited. I popped across the way and got a Starbucks instead.
