Alton Brown-approved.\n\nI could probably just leave the review at that, but I had such a wonderful time at the chocolate tasting I attended I should probably share a little bit more. \n\nFirst off, Gail is a delightful and sweet human. Her passion runs through everything she does, and she's warm, funny, and generally a great hostess. For the tasting, she walks you through a primer on cacao and chocolate production, and then leads you from country to country with samples of several different single-origin chocolates. She teaches you how to best sample, and how to identify different qualities. \n\nThe chocolate she sources is divine. My favorites were the samples from Colombia and El Salvador. Gail encourages you to take home what you can't eat (and to grab a few more pieces on the way out if you'd like), and I can't lie - I mowed down my leftover tasters today like there was no tomorrow. In addition to the pure samples, Gail offers you two truffles to test yourself at IDing what source was used - the coating is always the Colombian (yesssss), but it was crazy how you could still taste the identifying characteristics even with other flavors. \n\nAt this particular tasting, we were given a ginger and cognac truffle and the Machu Picchu truffle. Both were delicious. \n\nAfterwards, you can purchase more truffles and I couldn't resist. I chose the vanilla and rose varieties to try. I can't wait.
