Good for gym clothes and some clearance items- go elsewhere for anything else.\nClearance section is a jumble, womens and juniors sections both mixed up together. \n\nStore has a giant cosmetics area and half-decent furniture and home decor, but I came for clothes and there was no organization to any of the sections I browsed and dresses were strewn all over the place.\n\nWent at noon on a weekday, so it's not as if I came just prior to close and wondered why it looked like a bomb had hit it.
