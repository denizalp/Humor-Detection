My wife and I recently stayed at The Jockey Club for a 5 day trip to Las Vegas, and I have to say that our experience here was an unexpected surprise.  I have stayed at many of the major hotels on the Las Vegas strip, and I liked our room here better than any of the other places I have been (including Mandalay Bay, MGM, and a huge suite at New York, New York).  What separated the accommodations at The Jockey Club from everywhere else was that it was like staying in a full-sized apartment.  There was a full kitchen (with dish washer, stove\/oven, microwave, and refrigerator), a large living room with a sofa couch, a couple of TVs, and a nice bed room.  We also requested a room with a view of the strip, and we got an awesome view of the fountains at the Bellagio.  Our room far exceeded my expectations, and I was really happy.  Additionally, The Jockey Club is located right in the middle of the strip, with easy access to the Cosmopolitan.     \n\nSo why only 4 stars? ...well because of the high pressure sales pitch that they put on us to buy a time share when we checked in.  We were already using my father-in-law's timeshare that he never uses.  Why would we want another one??  The sales person was so pushy and manipulative, and I was completely disgusted by the tactics.  They promise all types of free meals and shows, but there was either some catch that makes them not really free or they give you things that anyone can get for free on the strip.  \n\nEven though the sales people are over the top pushy, I truly enjoyed the experience staying at The Jockey Club.  It is my understanding that it was recently renovated, and I was super impressed by the accommodations.  Some of the other amenities outside of the room were lacking, but I thought the room itself was excellent.  I am glad that my father-in-law has a time share here, because I would love to come back again.
