My name is Anthony De Falco.  I checked this place out while I was visiting my dad in AZ.  As a resident of the tri-state NYC area, I can say with unwavering and steadfast confidence that this is without a doubt the worst deli I have ever been to in my entire life.  The level of apathy and cognitive dissonance in this place was astounding.  I ordered- Chicken cutlet, fresh mozzarella, roasted red peppers, oil and vinegar and I essentially received a Subway quality chicken tender sandwich with some shredded mozzarella cheese covered in marinara, on the stalest bread to ever curse this earth.  How people can possibly rate this place at 4 1\/2 stars blows my mind.  I could literally go to the worst restaurant in Yonkers, NY and get a superior sandwich. You people make me ashamed to share the name. I think I will be legally changing my last name to Lindquist just so I can avoid any potential association with this abomination.\n\nEmbarrassing
