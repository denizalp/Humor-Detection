This is the worst gym I have ever belonged to. I signed for a year long membership and can't wait to pull the plug on that contract. \n\nThe manager is the rudest person I have ever met in my life. \n\nThe gym is very small and they fill every inch with work out equipment and weights. This doesn't sound like such a bad thing but tight areas when getting on and off cardio machines can be a real pain -- literally. \n\nParking is a pain anytime after 5pm. Street parking usually fills up fast.
