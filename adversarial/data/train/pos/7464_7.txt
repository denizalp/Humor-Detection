I don't get your illogical policies.\n\nI needed change for the parking garage, went to Sobey's and asked them to break a $20. She replies, \"sorry we cannot make change for people who are not customers- please buy something first...\". I told the lady that I needed change to park so I could buy my groceries and take them home afterward- she tells me sorry, it's the store's policy.\n\nGreat idea!!! Don't give customers change for parking, so they cannot park... and then they cannot buy! wow! what a business model!!!\n\nnever again sobey's, i rather drive a few minutes out of my way and not put up with your grade-school management policies.
