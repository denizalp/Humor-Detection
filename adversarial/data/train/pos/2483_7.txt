I don't have any tattoos, I don't wear Affliction MMA gear, I don't ride BMX or motocross bikes, and I don't smoke....but I do like to live like a rock star & gamble like one (once in awhile)!!! \n\nThe Hard Rock Hotel & Casino has been on my wish list of hotels to stay at for a long time now. I'm always played and dined here, but never had the chance to stay here. Well, wish fulfilled 11\/2010! Although it wasn't as grand spectacular as I had imagined\/hoped, it was a great two days with my lovely Jackie!!! \n\nWe had a nice Paradise Tower room over looking the famous Rehab pool, which was unfortunately closed for the winter season. The room was clean, stylish, and functional. \n\nIt did lack some things: hand moisturizer (hello, we're in the desert!), broken make up mirror lamp, rain shower leaked all over the bathroom floor, and a lack of towels. \n\nThe casino is far...really FAR from the Paradise tower. Not even joking! It was best for us to use the self park garage rather the valet because it was right next to our room tower and elevators. And since I'm on the Valet guys, it's best if you want to earn tips ($$$) if you aren't in a cluster fuck chit chatting while paying hotel guests need a little direction where to pull up for valet and check into your employer's hotel!!! \n\nCasino: it was sadly empty. Only 2 craps table and 2 roulette tables open. It must have been a slow night. I'm glad I walked out ahead $500+ Thank you!!! \n\nPS The new MTV Real World Las Vegas show is secretly filming there right now. We also ran into them at the Venetian Gondola rides. Filming a documentary......rrrright!
