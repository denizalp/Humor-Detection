Ahhh, teen angst!  My student Kelly works here and she rules so I have to give it 2 instead of 1 stars.  No one understands my pain, I cut myself so I feel alive.  I wear black on the outside because black is how I feel on the inside.  Mom and dad just don't get me. I am too original, my style absolutely has never, EVER been done before!  Punk is NOT corporate!!\n\nSeriously though, I have never shopped here.
