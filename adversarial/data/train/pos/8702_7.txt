I used a Living Social coupon for 2 people for high tea at Kimberly Ann's. Sounds like it should be a fun and enjoyable experience, right? Well, it turned out to be a lot of \"work\". We wanted to go to high tea in December, but they were completely booked. Ok - we were disappointed but we scheduled it for early January. Well, a week or so before the date we were to have high tea, they called and said they would be closed due to plumbing problems. Another disappointment but we rescheduled for later in the month. What made this difficult were all the \"rules\":\n\n1. You need to call at least 24 hours in advance to make the reservation.\n2. They require a Visa or Mastercard number to hold the reservation. No-show's who do not give 24 hours notice will be charged $25.00 plus tax. (Is this a doctor's office???)\n3. You must mention any coupon over the phone or you will be charged the full price on the day of your reservation.\n4. The coupon price does not include tax and gratuity. They suggest a gratuity of 18% - 25% of the original price of $25.00 per person.\n5. CASH ONLY for the $10.00 \"required\" gratuity for the coupon plus tax of $2.63 per 2 people. If you do not bring cash, you will both be charged the full price of the high teas.\n\nWOW! That's all I can say. While the food was terrific and the service was good, they also had an additional \"rule\" stating only one type of tea per table. What if one person wants decaf and the other wants caffeinated tea? Too bad! \n\nAs previously mentioned, there is a \"funny\" sign on one of the bathroom doors saying: \"If you have to go #2, please do not use this restroom.\" They then direct you to another restroom away from diners. Weird but true! I wish I had taken a picture of the sign.\n\nI'm a huge fan of high tea, but I won't go back to Kimberly Ann's. I would recommend the English Rose Tea Room in Carefree for an exceptional high tea experience. Check out their website: www.carefreetea.com\nAlso, the Biltmore and the Phoenician Resorts have fantastic high tea as well, for a higher price than the English Rose.
