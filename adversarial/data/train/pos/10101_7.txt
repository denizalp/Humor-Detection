I've heard lots of good things about Jin's and finally got to try it. \n\nFood was good.  Service was good.  \n\nJust make sure you get any egg rolls you order early on.  We were done with our meal when we realized we never got them.  So, I asked they be taken off the bill.  Apparently, they couldn't cause they were apart of the meal (but really weren't), so alright...just give them to me to take home.  \n\nThe manager confirms with me that we ordered them.  She verified.  Then some kid from the back runs out and ask if he delivered them to us, and I say \"no.\"  Our server then brings us one egg roll.  I said \"ok\" but we ordered two.  She checks her order pad again and says \"yes, you did,  do you want me to get another one?\"  Laughing,  I say \"no\" and walk out.  I'm referring to this as \"RollGate\".\n\nI don't understand restaurants that don't want to give customers what they pay for, especially when it costs them like $.50.  Needless to say, we will probably not go again. \n\nI'm still on the hunt for good Chinese on the West Side.
