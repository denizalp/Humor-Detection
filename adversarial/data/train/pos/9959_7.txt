I hate that I love McDonald's breakfast, but McDonald's breakfast isn't quite McDonald's, every junkie knows that. Unfortunately, I'm also a fan of the McNuggets and Bic Mac, which is becoming an issue. \n\nI just moved a few blocks from this glorious location, and I've been here twice already. It's a big clean McD's with an efficient staff, but there are lurkers in this place, so be aware. Today while I was waiting for my salty dark mistresses, someone swiped my order while I was on instagram*. I then had to wait a long time wondering if I'd missed my food, and finally reordered (at no cost, obviously) and got my goods to go. \n\nProps to whoever swiped my McMeal, McSneaky you McF. \n\nPEPPER''S PRO sweet and sour sauce. Honey? Pfft. Hot mustard? Bitch please. \n\n*Hipster karma?
