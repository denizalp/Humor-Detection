Pimpin' fries with veggie chili. (Thanks, Tonya P. for the recommendation. Total game changer.)\n\nFried pickles.\n\nVegetarian hot dogs.\n\nNature boy, ding dong style.\n\nTall, cool, cheap cans of PBR.\n\nThere's not a better place for you to enjoy heartburn-inducing food. Despite the lack of parking spaces and the not-so-enthusiastic service, it's a go-to for me. I would eat here once a week if my jeans didn't protest so loudly.\n\nGreat place for kids, or just grabbing dinner and beer with friends.
