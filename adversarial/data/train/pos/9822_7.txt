I find it very hard to rate and review casinos, only because I never have a good experience at any casino when gambling. Well I do every once in a blue moon, but those bad days always level it out.\n\nLets get to the point, well this place is off strip and usually casinos off the strip don't fare very well and ever live up to the hype compared to strip casinos. However, this casino\/hotel is one of my favorite places off the strip, why you ask? well for one thing it was a great sportsbook. Pretty much a sports bettors dream to come to this place. Not only does this place have a great sportsbook, but they layout of this casino is awesome. They also have a nice bowling alley, a small club, a movie theater nice bingo hall, and if you had to bring your kids because you're on vacation and no baby sitters, they also have a place called kids quest. Kids quest is a little joint for the kids to be entertained and watched by their small little staff. I'd go on about the cool things they have at Kids Quest, but this review is simply for Red Rock. Did I forget to mention their ampitheatre they just recently put in? They have a few cool bands perform here. Although I have yet to check one out, I heard their prices are pretty cheap considering the fact that they have some cool performers here.\n\nAll in all this place is probably my favorite place to lose money off the strip! Oh yea, one more thing the reason why they call this place Red Rock is because there really is a huge Red Rock that you will see when driving to this place, look towards the mountains.
