While the patio is to die for that is about all that keeps me returning to Reddstone.\n\nI play volleyball at the nearby Battery Park sand courts and we go to Reddstone each Thursday night for their $0.10 tacos.\n\nI am a recent full vegetarian and navigating the landscape has been mostly smooth, but Reddstone threw in a pothole. \n\nThe service at Reddstone is atrocious. Over the past year we have had an obvious coke user as a waitress, an extremely indifferent and rude woman and lately, inexperienced, non-critically thinking staff. The atmosphere is wonderful, but the service is atrocious. The owner is a nice guy, seems to know what he is doing, expect his front of the house staff. I have yet to be served by an attentive and kind waitress, instead it appears he just hires for looks? meh. Desperation? Maybe.\n\nBack to $0.10 tacos. The tacos are greasy meat which varies in consistency from week to week. When I was a carnivore, they weren't bad, had some spice to them...but now that I am of the herbivores; I was abruptly denied a taco haven. I was told there were no substitutions...okaaaay, but what about the vegetarians? \"Sorry, no substitutions.\" Once you add on jalape√±os, cheese and sour cream, all for $0.50 apiece it isn't even worth just buying a plain shell for the taco deal. \n\nThe only redeeming factor, outside of the patio, is the cheap beers Reddstone offers. You can get a tallboy PBR or Miller High Life for $3. Not bad. $2 Coronitas or $3 margaritas on Thursdays are a decent deal.\n\nAll in all, I was and have been sorely disappointed for some time. For all the positive press this place gets, you think the owner would invest a bit more in its staff as well as fares that appeal to more consumers...it would mean a regular Thursday night customer out of me.
