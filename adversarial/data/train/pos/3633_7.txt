This is a nice house that is a cafe and bakery. They sale several different pieces of jewelry for a great price. I came on a Saturday afternoon for a baby shower and we have a small room and the sunroom set up for the treats and food. The sandwiches were flavorful and the pasta salad and potato salad were nice. I think it's a great place to host a bridal shower, family dinner, club meeting, etc. they have a small gravel parking lot but on the weekend it appears you can park in company parking lot across the street. I am intrigued to come back and try this place on a different day and time. Enjoy!
