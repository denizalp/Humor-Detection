Echo Karaoke Box has the makings of a great place (large space, decent location, lots of seating) but several major weaknesses keep it from being awesome:\n\n1. Ri-cock-ulous bottle service price. $100 gets you a bottle of crap vodka (Smirnoff) and three mixers (flat Coke, fake tasting cranberry, and something else similarly unmemorable). It would be more worth it if the mixers weren't awful; hell, I would have paid more for vodka that didn't taste like distilled hairspray.Bottle service price aside, the room rental price is one of the most expensive I've ever seen for a private room Karaoke joint.  Also, no Diet Coke. Hmph. \n\n2. Poor song selection. A bunch of modern stuff, but not much by way of classics. I'm sorry, but who does Little Bow Wow at Karaoke? Where are the standards? Frank Sinatra, Journey... hell, only one measly Tom Jones song? Booo.\n\n3. Many songs selected didn't even have words at the bottom of the screen to sing along with. Whaaa?   \n\nWith that said, the rooms are large and did well at accommodating our big group. The service, though nice, was on the meh side - when I asked our server what our vodka choices there were, she looked at me like I'd grown a huge accessory nipple out of my forehead. \n\nIt was my first Karaoke joint in Toronto, so I'm hoping that there are other places that step up the game.
