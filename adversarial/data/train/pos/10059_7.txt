My first impression when I saw my stylist, was to run. I wish I would have. \nBut, I didnt want to hurt anyones feelings and just went with the flow. Its only hair, right?? \n\nI asked for a slight trim, some layering and bangs. \n\nI guess that is what I got.. but Id never go back. The back was uneven, hardly any bangs, and very little layering. I expected more from a $45.00 haircut.  \n\nWhile there and watching the others, I just wouldnt go back or suggest this place to anyone unless your over 65.
