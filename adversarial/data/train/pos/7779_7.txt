I'm a 22 year old girl on my way to work and got a flat in their parking lot. Literally. I walked over there and said \"this is embarrassing but can someone put my spare on my car, please.\" his reply,\" I only have one mechanic here, no.\" As he was saying that there were 5 mechanics walking behind him. I'm not kidding you. After pointing to the other men and saying \"really? All of you gentlemen here and no one can change a spare for a girl? Remin me to never come back here.\" his response? \"good, don't come back.\" don't EVER come here.
