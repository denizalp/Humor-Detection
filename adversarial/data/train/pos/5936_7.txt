Hard to believe that Christown was once a beautiful mall and the surrounding neighborhoods were solidly middle class.  Now the area is a ghetto, and each time the neighborhood has slipped a notch the mall has followed.  I'm giving the place two stars because it's more depressing than dangerous.  Your chances of being shot or mugged in the parking lot are pretty slim, at least during daylight hours.  Your chances of seeing a tattooed 300-pound woman in stretch pants beat the living daylights out of her four-year old child are excellent.
