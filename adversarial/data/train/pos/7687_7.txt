My buddy mentioned he just recently had some Bacon Tempura at this place, so i figured I'd give it a try.  Both my feet were pretty much inside the door after i previewed some of their pics yelp:  Poke Tacos and Green Tea Soba Salad.  Say no more.  \n\nAfter skimming through their menu only a few items caught my attention.  It's basically a sushi restaurant ala cart with extra offerings such as rice bowls and other interesting appetizers. \n\nGreen Tea Soba Salad with Shrimp and Ginger Soy Sauce:  This was a simple, cold dish where the dressing was heavy enough to slightly overwhelm the sweetness and aroma of the cha-soba.  Nevertheless it was refreshing and easy to enjoy esp on warmer days. 4\/5\n\nSpicy Bacon Tempura:  Value wise this was plentiful and delish.  I'd recommend splitting this with a party of 2 or more unless you really, really love bacon.  Better to enjoy when they arrived as the tempura loses it's crunch.  The sweet sauce paired well. 4\/5\n\nYellowtail Poke Tacos:  Our chef suggested this was the favorite of the others tacos (tuna, salmon, and snappers.)  A little heavy on the wasabi aoili, but that's ok because it was counter with a generous amount of Black Tobiko as well.  Don't share this dish unless you really like your friend.  4.5\/5\n\nUni on a spoon:  Another Chef's suggestion.  I wouldn't normally order Uni anywhere unless Chef's recommend it.  Even so I was under the impression that one ordered would be a spoonful but it came in three's.  Dressed in lemon juice and sea salt i was able to knock down two.  A personal achievement, but still not an Uni Fan.  No rating \n\nLastly we finished off with Monaka Ice Cream which is a waffle filled with Green Tea Ice Cream and Azuki Bean.  I don't believe this was made in house, but it was still really good. 4.5\/5  \n\nOverall i enjoyed F&B.  We ordered Sashimi and stuff, and everything served to us were fresh.  But i was hoping of some more creative dishes to try since their menu had an abundant amount of items.  Limited amount of seating.. I think i saw 7 tables?? Would come back if im around the neighborhood.\n\nServer is shy but attentive.. 10 days and counting lol
