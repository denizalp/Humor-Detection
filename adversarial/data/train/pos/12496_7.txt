This place is a joke.\n\nSeen it was a newer gym that opened up in Brampton, we checked out the website quickly and it said free 7 day trial was available. We figured we'd just go in and get it at the same time we'd be able to check out the facilities.\n\nWe walk in, receptionist and another guy is standing there talking. It was a bit awkward, we let them know that we were interested in the gym.\n\nThe guy who was standing there talking to the receptionist took us to the back. We tell him we're interested in checking out the gym and trying out the trial. He still made us fill out a bunch of paper work, then takes us on a tour of the gym.\n\nWe then asked for a trial on the gym, he suggested signing up and if we don't like it we can cancel, we have 10 days. We said the website offers a 7 day trial, he said that expires today (which it doesn't because it's still live right now) and he gives us a 3 day trial.\n\nAlso during our conversation, he answers his mobile phone without pardoning himself and he talks for roughly a minute while I'm there waiting for him. Then we just left after that, to be honest this place needs to hire people with some actual customer service skills because it goes a long way.
