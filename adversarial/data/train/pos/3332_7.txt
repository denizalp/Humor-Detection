Okay, the food blows ass here.  That much is a given.  But you're only eating here because 1) it's the company dollar and 2) you've lost all respect for yourself somewhere in Salt Lake City or Long Beach.  So let's not necessarily judge it on the quality of food.\n\nRather, let's judge it on the quantity of food.  You get a shit ton.  And, the waiters know exactly what kind of clientele they've got so if you're on your Blackberry or laptop, they leave you alone while you shamelessly tackle that mountain of chicken tenders and the monster milkshake.  \n\nThree stars because you get exactly what you expected (a non-judgmental waiter and a place to sit down).
