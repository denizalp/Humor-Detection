This is one of the weakest Denny's in the city. I am not sure if It's just this location in particular, but this one certainly has started to gip out on the portion sizes.\n\n2-3 years ago, the amount of fries that one received was generous, as was hash browns, or chunky potatoes.\n\nNot anymore. Maybe it's the recession, maybe they don't want to put prices up, but at the MacLeod Tr S Denny's the fries and hash brown portions are bordering on miserly. A handful or a little over.\n\nI hear that all the Dennys is owned by the same family (Mamood or Muhammed or some name like that) that also own all the Sandman hotels in town. I'm not sure about the veracity of that, so maybe dig a bit yourselves.\n\nIf it is true, then the one owner chain in Calgary is inconsistent accross the city. The Denny's in the NW, at  crowfoot is easily the best one. The one on trans canada bolted onto a Sandman is also rather weak. Sometimes they are even closed overnight!\n\nIf you want basic, well done brekkie type food, then if all the Denny's start being miserly with the portions, then dare I say it, Humpty's (I know, not exactly sophisticated but it doesn't pretend to be anything else *cough* Joey Tomatoes *cough*) is still a good fallback, and if you can find one, Perkins.
