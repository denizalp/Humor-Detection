This airline sucks! I booked travel in September and paid main cabin select.  They changed planes so my seats where changed. This is not the first time it happen years ago on Virgin Atlantic. I called them on it today as I went to log in and it nothing but lip service.  Total crap and now to move up they want even more money.  After this trip no more.   I have better service from Southwest then these guys.
