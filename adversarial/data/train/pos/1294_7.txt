A 100% vegan bakery in Central Phoenix? Dear God. All at once, I'm infuriated and relieved that it's so far away from my house.\n\nHere's what we ordered:\n1. Banana bread- \nIt has a brown sugar crust. It's delicate, and flavorful, and it has a brown sugar crust. Brown. Sugar. Crust. Order it.\n2. Winkie (Twinkie)-\nIf you want to go vegan but can't bear to give up Hostess crap, now you don't have to! It's just like a Twinkie, only it doesn't contain beef fat and won't give you cancer.\n3. Nami Cake (Ding Dong)\nThis is a rich, dark chocolate cupcake topped with chocolate ganache and filled with cream. Essentially, it's a Ding Dong, if the gas station suddenly became a patisserie. \n4. Chocolate chip cookie -\nIf you lean towards chewier cookies that are definitely on the sweet side, this is the cookie for you. Plus, they're huge and full of big chocolate chips, and everyone leans towards that.  \n5. Mini cupcake -\nThe one we sampled was a vanilla almond, which I should like... but the sweetness totally outweighed the flavor. However, I think that ratio goes over well with most people, so hey.\n6. Cake pops -\nThe chocolate cake pop covered in dark chocolate hit the spot. This was the most intense chocolate-y thing we ordered, which by the transitive property might make it the best thing? If you're a fan of chocolate, you're a fan of these. Millions of these.\n\nNext time: I still need to try something from the coffee bar, which will undoubtedly be accompanied by banana bread... and probably a cake pop (I mean, I drove all the way out there...)\n\nApparently, they also do a Tsoynami called \"The Mash\", which is filled with random mashed up baked goods (I was only informed of this afterward.) Now that I've tasted the desserts the old-fashioned way, separately, why not get them combined and smothered in ice cream? It only seems natural (and I mean, come on, I drove all the way out there...)
