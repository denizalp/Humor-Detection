This place does customized burgers, and does it well. On a weekday just minutes after opening for lunch, the place was already packed with people. I watched Giada on Food Network eat here a while ago, and ever since then I've had it at the back of my mind to check this place out. \n\nI ordered an Angus beef burger on ciabatta bread, with toppings of carmelized onion and peppered bacon. All the ingredients tasted fresh and blended well together. If I had to nit pick, the ciabatta bread was a bit on the dry side. It was begging to be oven warmed or briefly toasted on the grill. But I was so hungry, there was no way that burger was leaving my grasp. \n\nAs for the sides, the crown jewel had to be the buttermilk dipped fried zucchini fries. Piping hot fresh zucchini interior, crispy not-too-heavy breading exterior, and nice seasoning. Dip it in some ranch sauce, and it was the perfect compliment to our burgers. We also had sweet potato fries, which was good as well, but didn't quite hold up a candle next to the zucchini fries. \n\nPrices are reasonable, and service was efficient and friendly. Next time, I'll have to spring for the Kobe beef burger, with pepper jack cheese and grilled mushrooms. Yes, I've given it some thought. So if you're ever in the mood for a good burger in a casual atmosphere in Vegas, you'll know where to go.
