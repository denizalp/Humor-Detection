I never thought I would start a sentence with \"I would rather go to Walmart than.....\" Until I went to WinCo. Can someone please tell me what the appeal of WinCo is? \n\n1. The prices are NOT cheaper. Pineapple for $2.99? I bought one at Smiths for $0.99. Asian pear for $1.99? I bought one at Trader Joes for $1.50. 4 kiwis for $4.00?? I bought 2 for a $1.00 at Whole Foods. Have I made my point?\n2. Where are the cashiers?? 2 cashiers for the 10+ people in line (they all had a cart full of stuff). Plus you bag your own groceries (Not a problem, but hire some extra cashiers to make up for it)\n3. Buying alcohol is a hassle. The alcohol is sold up front in a separate section. If they're busy you need to get in the regular line (10 min. wait?) and then have that cashier go fetch your alcohol (while everyone behind you gives you death stares). Hmmmm maybe I don't need that bottle of wine tonight......\n\nI guess it's that they're open 24 hours.......? Is that one their one and only selling point? Sorry WinCo- my first time with you will also be my last.
