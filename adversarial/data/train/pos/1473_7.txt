Quiktrip is another one of the super awesome gas stations that has everything your heart desires. This particular location is pretty new (last 2-3months or so?) and the staff seems to be very much on the ball. It kinda makes me wonder if they loaded the deck with corporate hires so in the next 6 months you might see some of them downgraded from the \"super happy excited to see you folks\" to the \"just working here to afford my 12 pack for the evening\" type people. The inside is very much new and they have all the assorted roller-dogs and junk food you could ever want. The prices on the hot dogs are very cheap but I haven't tried any since I kinda value my health a little more than the potential savings they afford.
