That Bud's has continued to stay open while businesses on this road constantly shutter around them is a testament to something done right. Occupying one half of what used to be Lawn Gnome, it's incredibly narrow. But efficient. And they've got something for everyone. \n\nLots of glass blown by local artists. Their selection of various pieces is aesthetically pleasing and highlights unique, Arizonan craftsmanship.\n\nBut most importantly, they've got good stuff for incense, vaping, or even smokes if you don't wanna walk far during an evening on RoRo. Let's hope they stick around.
