Took car in for an unrepairable flat tire and walked out only paying $22. Nice to see previous tire and certificate purchase paid off. The wait was to be expected given arriving an hour within closing. Inside of the store was comfortable, thanks to their traditional red chairs. Staff was friendly and helpful as always. One star deduction was due to having to remind them twice that I wanted the tires rotated. Overall, pleasant experience for flat tire drama.
