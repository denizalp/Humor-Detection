This is one of my family's favorite malls of all time. We will be boycotting this mall due to ruining Halloween for our little girl. They claimed they celebrated it on the 30th and were not giving candy out on HALLOWEEN!! Another store told us they were not allowed to solicit on Sunday. We had to trick or treat in our neighborhood. The working class were giving candy out but corporate America just couldn't do it this year.
