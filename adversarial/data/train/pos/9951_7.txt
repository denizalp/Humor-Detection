My sister goes to this location pretty frequently to tan and has been looking extremely tan which is the only reason I'm giving them a star. If there were a negative rating I would happily go with that instead.  One of these weekends I'm tempted to find out who upper management and tell them all the stuff that their employees do in front of people on the clock. Calling other businesses to find out their sales and gossiping about other employees is extremely unprofessional. I am a manager at a cancer clinic and if my staff ever talked like this in front of patients I'd have them written up in a heart beat. So for my sister to feel so uncomfortable because of the staffs lack of common sense to know when to talk about bonuses due to sales and their terrible personalities is completely absurd. \n\nThis place better be ready for me next time I am close by when I go with my sister. My sister should not be putting up with this behavior especially when they like to charge her card random charges when she has already paid her initiation fee when she first went in. My sister should have taken her friends advice who works at another tanning salon when she said none of these chain tanning locations have pleasant staff. Is this the type of business you feel proud to run with salty disrespectful staff? That's tasteful.\n\nI understand commissions and selling things, I've been in that business before. But to be harassing clients and not friendly are two totally different things. If someone were a good salesman and pleasant that's awesome I've been in that boat. But being salty and rude is another thing.
