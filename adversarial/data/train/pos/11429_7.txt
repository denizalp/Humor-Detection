More like... Club \"MIS-Fortune\"! Guaranteed loss every time for me, finally left my card there to never return. I've lived here for over a year and wish I never stepped foot in that place. You would think that some dingy, dirty, ghetto local shit-hole like this would at least give you the incentive to come back by awarding you with a win, despite the hundreds and hundreds I've spent there!!! I find myself going there after we go to the real casinos and then on our way home, try our luck at this filthy smelly ghetto local trash fuck-hole only to lose AGAIN over and over. Take your money and loyalty elsewhere, this place is gross and machines are rigged as F to ensure you lose ... Pure GARBAGE!!! I guess they have to pay their employees somehow! F this place!!! Hope it burns down!
