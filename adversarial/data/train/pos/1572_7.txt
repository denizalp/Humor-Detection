Located in my favorite hotel Cosmopolitan.  It's close to the entrance by the concierge.   The bar is modern, sophisticated, and classy.  \n\n::Drinks::\nI told Alan the Bartender to recommend a cocktail that was fruity but strong.  He ended up creating something for me.  I didn't ask for the name of my drink but on the receipt, it's called Hendricks Martini Bump.  On top was foamy with a hint of strawberry flavor.  Second round, I got a Lemon Drop.  My friend got Johnnie Black and Yamazaki.  We liked our drinks! \n\n(http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/user_local_photos?userid=NO5e0WtLAOYcjheLU6OEVg&start=200&select=136rxjpP-_S6Yh0VkVvHCw)\n\n(http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/user_local_photos?userid=NO5e0WtLAOYcjheLU6OEVg&start=200&select=ScCb2zPS-sW79vqkjAHSTg)\n\n::Customer Service::\nAlan was very friendly.  He made our drinks perfect and we talked to him for a bit. I like how he offered to create my drink for me instead of just pointing out a drink in the menu.  \n\n::Rating::\n4 Stars because we were satisfied with our drinks and the ambiance.  Customer service from Alan was also great.  \n\n::M's Notes::\n-Pricey drinks \n-Parking Garage
