This has to be the first supermarket that actually runs out of shopping carts, and  needs a traffic control officer inside of the market to direct the traffic flow, but people don't really mind at all because of selection, and specials around this store.\n\nTheir bulk area is very impressive, and have a nice collection of items.    The meat department had a few killer specials, and I couldn't pass up the $ 2.98 foot and half Turkey sub sandwiches.     Also, this is the first place I seen in Henderson with Tellamook ice cream...not bad at all :)
