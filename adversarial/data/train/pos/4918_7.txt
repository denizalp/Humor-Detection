Sunday is all-day Happy Hour for food and drinks- that's reason enough to give this place a try. Grab a cheap, light lunch here between stops browsing the shops in Boca Fashion Village with some friends. \n\nHH eats menu has several sushi rolls half-off and a list of others priced at $6\/each- opted for the BAMA ROLL (crab mix, cream cheese, jalapeño, tuna, avocado, soy paper, spicy motoyaki sauce), which I enjoyed and the VOODOO ROLL (spicy crawfish mix, avocado, habanero tuna mix, smelt roe), which was both falling apart and had unbalanced flavors. \nWould come back with a group to try more of the HH menu, but the sushi options here seem to be hit or miss based on this and vague prior visits- nothing in particular stands out. The macadamia nut chicken is a tasty dish if you're in the mood for a non-seafood entrée.\n\nInterior is a little swanky, seating available at the sushi bar, alcohol bar, or patio, as well as regular indoor seating. Service is friendly and dishes have nice presentation. Not sure I'd return outside of HH times though.
