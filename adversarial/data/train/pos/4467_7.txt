A bit stuffy for my taste... \n\nI went there for dinner, so brunch may be a different story.  The waitress was a sweetheart and able to accommodate my food allergies, so no complaints there, but the crowd is a bit \"old fashioned\" to put it nicely.  Jaws agape and staring when a young couple walked in and the girls shoulders were bare. How dare she... I can only imagine their blatant stares come summer once people are in less clothing due to the 120 degree heat!
