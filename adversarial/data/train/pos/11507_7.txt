I really wanted to like these guys. I really did.\n\nIt's Wednesday, and I have an event Saturday evening. Need the place spruced up a bit. Call these guys up -- they have an awesome deal going at LivingSocial. I'd have to pay a $35 trip charge for them to get to Gilbert, but no worries. They say they can come Friday at 6.30pm. Crap - I have plans then. OK, I'm gonna re-arrange my Friday so that I'm home when the cleaners get here.\n\nIt's Friday evening, I'm excited! They're on their way, right? Wrong. They called to say, about that Sat morning appointment... umm... what? You guys are supposed to be coming, like now. What? We have no record of that. Huh.. OK. Alright, we can come Saturday at 2pm, will that work? Sure, my event's at 6 so, no worries.\n\nIt's Saturday, 2pm, I'm excited! They're on their way, right? Wrong. 2.15pm... 2.30pm... 2.45pm. This is getting ridiculous. I call up Marjorie. So, you guys gonna come by at 2pm, yeah? Oh yeah, sorry, the girl is sick. \n\n...\n\nSo, you couldn't tell me this earlier today? Well, she was supposed to call you. OK, she didn't. Would you like to reschedule? So I'm like, look Marjorie, allow me to give you some insight on how many things I've moved around to accommodate you guys... she listens for like 30 seconds, and then cuts me off to say, she couldn't foresee the girl getting sick, she's sorry for the inconvenience, and would I like to reschedule. I say, Marjorie, I get all that, I just want you to understand things from the customer's point of view, and I feel like you're not listening. She tells me she's trying to listen, but she has a migraine and really just wants to know if I want to reschedule.\n\n...\n\nNo Marjorie, I do not want to reschedule. Ever.
