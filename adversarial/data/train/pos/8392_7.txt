I think I have decided Pullano's has made it in to my top 3 pizza places in AZ... It has all my favorites in a New York Style Pizza. The cheese is stringy and plentiful, the crust is crispy and sweet, and there are always tons of  toppings. I've also had the wings and cheese curds and both were also fabulous. It's hard to get good cheese curds anywhere in AZ. I'd say these are not the best I have had but they are pretty close. The wings are large, crispy, and always have tons of sauce, and tons of fun and delicious sauces at that. I always forget that they have really great weekly deals, so maybe look those up before you give them a try. They have a deal where you get a free personal Pizza with purchase of a beverage, a buy one get one 50% off Italian meal, and tons more. And if you are looking for a good dive bar there is one attached to the main dinning room that is always poppin.
