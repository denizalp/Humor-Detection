Today was the first time we used Kimberly's Kleaning. They did a fantastic job! The baseboards are dustless, the area around the toilet is spotless, our chrome has shone like never before. They even got the smudgy handprints off our stainless steel appliances. They even followed our request to have the coffee table cleaned only with Pledge. Their prices are fantastic! We are definitely using this service over and over again! Please tell your friends about Kimberly's Kleaning!
