Such a fun place to visit!   You can sample anything you desire.   So many weird and wonderful flavors.  If you like flavored popcorn, this is your place!\n\nOK, so what am I doing here?  I don't like flavored popcorn.  Well, other than carmel corn, that is.  Love me some caramel corn!  \n\nThe owner, Laurie, greeted me right when I walked in the door.  The customer service here is extraordinary.  Even though the store was extremely busy, each customer was greeted and waited on in turn.  There must have been a half dozen or so employees on duty and everyone of them was hustling!  \n\nI was really happy to find they sell a lot of cool retro candy here.  I had to buy some big red Wax Lips so when i got back to my hotel room I could put on some Stones and strut around like Mick Jagger.  Bought some Red Hot cinnamon candies so my tongue would be totally red.     Pleased to meet you, hope you guessed my name.\n\nOnce I had my candy selections in hand, I turned my attention to the popcorn.  I sampled the French Toast and kinda liked it.  Also tried a chocolate covered type, which I didn't much care for.  \n\nI went in with the intention of buying some carmel corn, so I tried those next.  They offer regular and sea salt varieties.  I thought the sea salt was a little better than the reggo.  \n\nI bought two packages of the sea salt caramel and one of the French toast.  With the retro candy, it was all under $10.   Such a good time and so much fun for under $10.  Dang!\n\nMikey C says: Never was a popcorn girl\n                       Thought that was a good solution\n                       Hangin' with the raisin' girls\n                       She's gone to the other side...
