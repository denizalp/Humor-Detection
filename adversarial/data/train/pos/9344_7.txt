why does this place insist on letting you know how great their delivery is when they only have a delivery radius of ONE MILE? i live two miles from this location and apparently that's just ~too far~ for them.\n\nanyone can have super fast delivery if they only have to drive a mile! the most amusing thing to me is that within a 3 mile radius of my house there are THREE jimmy john's and not one will deliver to me. seriously, it's ridonk.
