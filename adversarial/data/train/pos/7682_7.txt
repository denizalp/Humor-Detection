Wow, attitude at a Men's clothing store in a mall. . . \nI'm blown away. \n\nActually, I kind of am. Being a shopper of Barney's, Sak's, and countless little awesomely fashionable boutiques, I thought I'd already experienced the worst of the snooty customer service. I was wrong. \n\nI went in looking for a sassy little black waistcoat. Not exactly asking for the moon here, as they are quite fashionable these days, and upon seeing one displayed on a mannequin in the window, I ventured in. Big mistake. \n\nSadly, after \"hello\" this trip went south fast. First the guy thought a waistcoat was a coat that went to your waist. . . uh. no. \n\nStrike one \n\nThen he proceeded to argue with me that it was called a vest (not once, but twice, mind you). \n\nStrike two \n\nThen he got it off the mannequin in the window, and when I saw it was a 42 (I'm a 38), I wasn't interested. I got a snotty response about tailoring and them having UPS. \n\nStrike three \n\nThen after hearing about how I was wrong in calling it a waistcoat, AGAIN I asked him to hold it for an hour . . . I mean, hell, Saks will hold thousands of dollars of clothing for days. This guy just smiled and said that he'd put it back on the mannequin. \n\nStrike four \n\nFour strikes, you're fucked. \n\nBlow me, buddy.
