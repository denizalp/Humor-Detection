What took me so long \n\nI have driven by Los Taquitos dozens of times and have never stopped in, that is until today. All I have to say is, what took me so long. Los Taquitos is located in a strip mall, I know there many of those strip mall cafes that don't always work out, but Los Taquitos isn't one of those. Los Taquitos takes taco making to the next level. The decor inside Los Taquitos is reminiscent of a Dia del Muerte pageant. Once inside, you know immediately by the incredible aroma that you are in the right place for great tasting Mexican food. \n\nOn this visit I  tried each of the three tacos and a chille relleno.  Everything was delicious; the tacos pastor was incredible. The meat in these tacos was tender, flavorful, and practically melted in my mouth. The Carne Asada Taco is stuffed with bubbling, juicy bits of lightly marinated skirt steak, nestled in a warm homemade tortilla, delicious doesn't begin to describe the Carne Asada Taco. However, I couldn't possibly overlook the Al Pastor with its sweet meat, topped with onions and cilantro, so flavorful, moist, and delicious, I could have ate a dozen, and on Taco Tuesday at $1.00 a taco, I just might.\n\nI would highly recommend a stop at Los Taquitos for lunch or dinner.  Nothing fancy; but really delicious food,great service, and wallet friendly pricing.
