Finding an editor can be daunting,  and finding someone who not only is invested in your project but is also easy on your budget can feel impossible. I stumbled upon Ashley's blog a couple years ago and then found out she self published a book. When it came time to get my own novel edited I meant to ask her who she used but then found out she had her own editing company. It was what I call kismet.\nAshley is not just a great editor,  she is a wonderful story teller. She understands what makes a story valuable to the reader and helps guide the writer toward their perfected manuscript. \nHer style of editing is extremely helpful adding notes and grammar fixes along side positive feedback. I never once felt that she pushed too far on the fixes, every piece of advice she gave was worth listening to. \nI think the best part of Ashley's editing service is that she is honest about what needs to be adjusted without feeling as though she is taking advantage of the time you are paying for. \nI will most definitely be going back to Ashley for my next round of editing.\nAshley is truly worth every penny!!!!
