Food this good should not be coming from a bar in strip mall, but good lawd!\n\nI know what you're thinking, \"5 stars for a Gastro Pub?\", seriously though this place has some of the best bar food I've eaten in a long time and I use the term, \"bar food\" loosely. I mean house smoked Pastrami Egg Rolls, Fried Kobe Beef Sliders and a insane calamari dish. Who's the f**king mad scientist in the kitchen?!\n\nRebel Republic is tucked away in a random strip mall off Sahara Ave. and the only reason I was able to spot it, is because of their giant glowing neon blue ribbon sign. Finally, all those years of drinking that terrible PBR slop are paying off. When you walk up to Rebel Republic you first notice a keen little patio area outside of the restaurant possibly for sipping and sampling. I got here around 1a.m. and it was still too hot to eat outside, so I decided to belly up to the bar.  \n\nThe beer selection can be overwhelming even to the most veteran hop heads. From what I understand they have over 52 beers on tap at all times, which is music to my ears; \"I'll start with the Dogfish Head 60 Minute IPA\". As I sipped my beverage, I noticed that the menu items here were very intriguing. \"Bartender, who's in charge of the food?\" \"Oh, we hired a chef to come in and revamp the menu and then teach the permanent chefs how to prepare each item\"... Oh you fancy huh?\n\nThis made sense.  As I stated in the first paragraph the food here is amazing and is made fresh to order 24 hours a day! Literally you can get Kobe Beef Sliders at four in the morning... how awesome is that? Speaking of the super sliders, these are amazing little bites of heaven, perfectly cooked, seasoned, and placed between two soft pillows of sweet bread. Oh mama!\n\nThe Pastrami Egg Rolls is pretty much exactly what it sound like. You know, delicious! Salted cured meat, wrapped in filo-dough, deep fried, and served with a house made thousand island sauce. Seriously, this goes great with a solid IPA.\n\nThe final thing I decided on was the calamari. This comes in a bowl with pickled seaweed. (I'm not sure about that?) These tasty morsels resemble that of a sweet and sour chicken, but taste just like perfectly cooked calamari with a spicy, saucy coating. I almost ordered another round. \n\nRR has a very chill vibe and the decor of a Midwestern family's basement. Animal heads and wood paneling for days. Plus the servers here are very helpful when it to comes to ordering beers. They will have a beer sample ready and in your hand before you can even ask the question, \"is that a hoppy beer?\" \n\nPRO TIP: Check-In when you arrive and get a $2 PBR. If you're into that sort of thing.
