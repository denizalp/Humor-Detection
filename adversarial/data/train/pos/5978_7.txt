Excellent Southern Indian food!  There is not much I can add that hadn't been said already.  Very good dosas and a wide selection....traditional as well as creative varieties.  The sambar and chutneys that came with dosas are so fresh and tasty, they must be house-made on the same day.  \n\nThe place is clean and tastefully decorated.  Pretty good service despite being very busy.\n\nThe only tip I'd give if you've never been to this place is....do NOT, do NOT follow the GPS.  Guru is located in Derry Village strip mall which is on the north side of Derry road between McLaughlin and Saint Barbara.
