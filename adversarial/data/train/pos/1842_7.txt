These guys are a joke. There is a HUGE reason why they are \"CASH ONLY\"... This keeps you from having ANY recourse. \n\nThe iPad screen was loose after they fixed it and when I took it back, I literally heard them hammering on it the frame to fix where they dropped it. \n\nThe button still feels funny and using the Yelp Deal was an ORdeal because no one knew what was going on or I'd they even took it. THANKS YELP FOR LURING ME here so they could make my iPad look horrible. \n\nThe promised times it would be done were constantly changing, too. Funny how it settled down and they couldn't give me the run around in person. \n\nJack-holes. Yelp should be ashamed for partnering with them.
