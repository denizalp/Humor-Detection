I'm not a big fan of country clubs in general, I rather attend a grungy music venue than spend a day at a country club. I'm not sure what it is. That being said, where country clubs are concerned Donalda is a pretty sweet one. \n\nFirst off, it's tucked off in a residential area, which is super weird. I thought my GPS was leading me astray again, but it wasn't! Donalda is hidden away from the noisy DVP, York Mills and Don Mills road that border it... \n\nI was here for a wedding, which is actually a beautiful place. The hall where the reception is looks like an ol' school little building. It has two floors, but the second floor only spans half the first floor and is mainly used for office and dressing room\/storage etc. \n\nThe hall was decorated nicely and all the staff were extremely courteous and friendly.  The food was absolutely amazing! Wedding food can go either way, and this was probably one of the best wedding meals I've had. The wild mushroom soup and the creme brule were rockin' my socks off. \n\nThe only negative thing about this place, is that the dance floor was in a completely separate area. I guess this catered more towards an older crowd, or maybe it wasn't initially designed to host weddings and they added the dance floor in later, but it made for much difficulty getting people on the dance floor. I like the concept of an integrated dance floor in the dancing area, it makes for an interesting dynamic! \n\nAll and all, Donalda is what it is, and for what it is, it does a good job!
