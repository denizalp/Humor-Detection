Had brunch here with friends this past Sunday. The food was pretty good but definitely heavy. About 70% through what felt like a 5 egg goat cheese omelette I hit a wall. I plowed through it afterwords of course, but I still hit it regardless. They're definitely pouring heavy cream into these bad boys for sure.\n\nHeart stopping brunch for 2 (including a 5oz glass of freshly squeezed OJ) will come out to just under $50. It's pricey for breakfast, but if you aren't doing it all the time what the hell. Giv'er.\n\nHash browns good. \nComplimentary pre-entry mini baguette good.\n\nAlso, Anne Hathaway served our food.\n\nr
