Way too many fucking issues.   Lets start with the customer service when you call for a cab.  Unprofessional, talk in slang.  I called for a cab and then got a call telling me my cab was there, went downstairs never saw the cab.   Called the taxi service number and they kept insisting that i was the idiot n said well the cab is there waiting for you.  Puts me on hold and tells me 5 minutes later to tell them what im wearing.  I said a black shirt and why is that relevant.  Lady says quietly we're going to send another cab.    I said another cab? There wasnt ever a first one.  She insisted yea there was until she finally admits 30 seconds later yea sorry he wasnt there.  How the fuck can u call me to tell me my cab is waiting downstairs when they werent ever there.     \n\nNow my actual can driver.  First thing he asks can u pay cash? I said sorry i only have card, then he goes, \" can we stop by atm?\"   I said no because im already late enough because of your company.  I know its not your fault but i need to get to te tempe campus for a meeting.    Thia fucker still asks to stop at the atm cause its 2 blocks away.   He doesnt fucking understand i dont have time.   Then asks for directions to tempe campus.  Idiot gets lost and asks to borrow my phone as gps. \n\nFucking whack.
