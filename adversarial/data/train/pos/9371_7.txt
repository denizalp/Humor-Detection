Showed up at 1:45 on a Sunday (they close at 3pm) and was turned away by the hostess with a poorly explained \"we're not seating any more for the rest of the day\" -- something to the effect of them taking a lot of reservations and being unable to accommodate walk-ins. The restaurant was half-empty. I guess their spoons are even smaller than they advertise.
