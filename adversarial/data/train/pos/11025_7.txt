Mystic Muffin is a little island of joy amidst a sea of concrete and cars. \n\nI stopped bringing in my lunch to work because the falafel is SO DELICIOUS. Get it in a sandwich or get it as part of a special. And I know salads have a reputation for being boring, but I dream about their regular chickpea, cabbage and lettuce salad. It's just PERFECT.\n\nThe world famous apple cake is great, but I'm really thankful for the rice krispy squares. Sometimes a grown woman has got to have a rice krispy square. The oatmeal raisin cookies are also good. Haven't tried the eponymous muffins yet.\n\nActually, I haven't tried much of anything yet, beyond the items listed above. The falafel is just too good not to order. Although, thanks to these Yelp reviews, I think I might try the chicken and potato salad with eggplant. \n\nThe icing on the (apple) cake is obviously Elias and Wonita, who are fantastic. Elias always asks about my day while preparing my falafel. It's never very interesting, so mostly he just tries to sell me Mystic Muffin t-shirts. FACT: if you take a picture of yourself wearing a Mystic Muffin t-shirt anywhere outside of Ontario, Elias will give you a free whole slab of apple cake, which actually costs more than the shirt; the deal never expires!\n\nHmmm. Maybe I've been going there too often. I've memorized the sales pitch.
