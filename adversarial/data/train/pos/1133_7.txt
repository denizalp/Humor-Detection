I love this place so much. I remember when I first moved here I would walk by it all the time and pay it no mind. From the outside it always seemed a bit like a dive. How wrong I was! \n\nFor my second visit it was also during the hours where they have their late night menu. You can get an 8 oz sirloin for 13 bucks which is what I had my heart set on. It got me through the work week knowing that on Friday night I would be having an amazing steak. It's a great deal considering during normal hours their steaks will average 20 to 40 dollars. \n\nFried cheese curds were shared among the table. A friend thought they might actually be better than the old fashioned's cheese curds! \n\nThe French onion soup I had for an appetizer. It was good but not something I would order again. \n\nBoth times I've eaten downstairs and the ambiance is wonderful. Cozy, intimate, fun tunes, and great friendly waiting staff.
