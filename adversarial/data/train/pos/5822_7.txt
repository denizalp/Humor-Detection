RIP Nostrano.\nSomething happened. Service. Food. Drinks. Thumbs down. This used to be a great place for dinner but it seems like they intended to close, didn't, and tried to drag the last of the life out of the restaurant as long as possible. Time to put it down.\n\nFun tip: don't text while your guests wait for the check for 5 minutes and then ask if they need anything when you come back without the check.
