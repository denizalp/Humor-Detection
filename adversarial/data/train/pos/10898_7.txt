Not at all impressed by the food at India Oven. I've been here a couple of times & it's definitely going downhill. It was never that great to begin with but one huge noticeable change is how they bring out the tandoori chicken when you go for the buffet. Before, they used to serve it on a hot & sizzling fajita platter with onions & lemons & we went there just a couple of days ago and all they brought out was 2 pieces of cold tandoori chicken on a small plate. The chicken itself didn't taste good. As far as the buffet, it's nothing great ... actually, it was not even good. The mango lassi had a weird taste, super tart, almost as though it had gone bad. The two Indian chicken curry options had okay tasting gravy; the chicken was a little slimy though so I didn't eat it. The chilli chicken was not tasty at all, just spicy & it was almost like they had tried to make it Chinese style? The vegetarian options weren't much better either. My date & I were discussing the food as we were eating it & I think I said \"I don't like that\" enough times that I'm not going to be returning to this restaurant. The only thing I did say that was good, & in my opinion is a huge part of enjoying Indian food, was the garlic naan. Also, the service was on par, even when it was busy. Highly disappointed with my experience, especially when there aren't many Indian restaurants to eat at in the Gilbert area.
