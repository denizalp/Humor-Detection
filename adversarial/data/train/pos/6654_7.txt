I threw my 30th B-day bash here. I wanted a nice classy, but not pretentious place to have friends gather and have a drink with me. This was perfect. \n\nWe had the entire lower bar section officially, although we could have spread out to the rest of the place (lobby) if we wanted to. I had invited almost everyone I ever knew, and so I had a good 50-60 people dropping in and out. It was a perfect space for an intimate party. \n\nI chose a cash bar, but paid for some appetizer platters (if more people, you can pre-order the larger catering menu platters). We had more than enough food (invite was post dinner specifically) for at my cost of $100. \n\nMy only caveat was that planning the event, when I did finally get a chance to speak to the special events people, everything was fine, but I did get some attitude when I was asking simple questions to their front of the line staff.  Yes, this is a lobby, and not a 'bar' or 'lounge' but easy to confuse since it's completely open like this, and allows such a party. \n\nAlso, this might be petty, but the space was reserved for me, but we had two people friends with the bartender that was sitting at the bar having drinks. His choice really, but the rest of the place was wide open. \n\nIf it wasn't for the fact I love to try new places, I would totally have a party here again.
