4:30 am and a long drive home only means, McDonalds Hashbrowns.  Then maybe a Sausage Mcmuffin with Cheese.\n\nSo it was me, my son, my uncle and my mom.  This was to start I day.  I hate to say it but breakfast on the go has to be McDonalds.\n\nWe all got our respective breakfast sandwiches and drinks.  But the thing of note for me was the fact that we ordered 7 Hashbrowns.  The drive thru lady kept repeating \"7\"?  \n\nYes, 7 Hashbrowns.  We're a Hashbrown loving family.
