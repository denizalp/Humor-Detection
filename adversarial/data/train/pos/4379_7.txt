A homeless man came up to the cashier cussing her out and continued to go on for about 20 minutes. The manager didn't acknowledge me and instead tried to laugh it off with the homeless man, where I as a customer stood there. I finally was helped after the homeless man was escorted and had possibly the worst breakfast sandwich I've ever had. I got violently ill after eating... not exaggerating at all. Do the employees wash their hands? YIKES! For a corporate fast food chain you would think they would have more regulations!
