I've known Jay & Tina for years. They are both talented, intelligent lawyers. \n\nI'm an attorney myself, but my practice is limited to a few specific areas. Whenever I have clients outside my practice area, I am happy to refer them to Yan Kenyon because I know they will be in great hands. I've had numerous clients get back to me and let me know how happy they are with Jay & Tina's work. \n\nA few years ago I was in a car accident myself. I retained Jay to handle my case. Even though my case was small and my injuries were (thankfully) minor, Jay was extremely professional and got me a good settlement in a short amount of time. \n\nOverall this is a great firm with sharp attorneys. I will continue to refer my own clients to them with confidence and if I'm ever in need of their services, I'll happily retain them again myself.
