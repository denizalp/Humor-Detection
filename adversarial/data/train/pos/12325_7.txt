So I wrote this review and I was asked to call the branch manager to try and resolve the problem. I was told that if you make any mention of owning another car they have to take it. I don't owe any money on the car and I was already approved until they found out I own a truck, then they wanted to throw that in the deal. So my advice to anyone is LIE when you go into JD Byrider, they will try to take your first born. \n\nMy previous review\n\nThey try to take advantage of people in need. They approved me for a car with  $500 down, then when they found out I had just paid off a truck, they switched up and said I had to give them my truck and $500. I asked them \"What if you didn't know I had a truck?\" They said then you would just need $500. I am a single mother with an autistic child and I spent 3-yrs paying my truck off and the engine went out on the last payment. This place is a disgrace and should be ashamed for trying to take advantage of people in need. If you didn't know about the truck you would have took $500, but because I have a truck that I own you want to basically STEAL it from me. You lied and said it was a stipulation with my finance company and they said that's a lie. I own the truck and they have no say so over it at this point. I even asked if I gave you the truck would I still have to pay  $500 and you still said yes. You are crooks and I will report this to the BBB.
