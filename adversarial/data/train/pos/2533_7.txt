We went because it was listed as a gay bar, but there were more straight women on bachelorette outings than gays, so there were no seats except the reserved ones for women..  We ventured upstairs because there was no sign or barrier and were yelled at rudely. Not sure how strangers were supposed to know the rules with no signs. \nDrinks were fine on the very smoky patio, but I wouldn't recommend this place. To anyone.  Especially not out of Towner's.
