Yeah yeah, I don't eat meat, but I'm reviewing this place anyway! \n\nGot the \"Veggie platter\" which was just your choice of 3 sides, hah. Mac n cheese was AWESOME. Sauteed mushrooms.. DE-FREAKING-LICIOUS. Everyone loved their barbecued meats with split decisions on the sauces. I liked both the tomato and vinegar based ones, really couldn't choose. \n\nOnly thing, spicy pinto bean side is actually more a bean soup with a lot of bacon in it, so couldn't eat that. \n\nFun decor, lots of tvs to watch the game, and great service. Our waitress was friendly, efficient, and very accommodating.
