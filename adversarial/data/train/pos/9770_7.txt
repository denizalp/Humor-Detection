After opening more than a hundred franchised restaurants, you have to wonder when the \"Original\" name becomes worthless.\n\nLocated in yet another soul-less strip mall, this OPH is clean, well-managed, and predictable.  Charming?  Naah.  Homey?  Please.  Solid?  Yeah, solid.  You get good grub, reasonable prices without all that fussy \"personality\" clogging up your dining experience.\n\nI was working nearby and just needed a quick late breakfast\/early lunch and had never been to an Original.  The menu?  Six eggs in each omelette.  Let that sink in, for just a minute:  every omelette served up in this joint has a half dozen eggs.  That should be enough for a family of six, but wait for it...  You also get THREE buttermilk pancakes, with each omelette.  I struggled with the menu for a bit, then ordered a BLT; it was the only way I could figure out how NOT to have my meal with a sidecar trio of gut-busting flapjacks.\n\n(On the corporate website, there is an actual page called \"What Are Pancakes?\"  So, let me get this straight:  A customer has made it to the page called \"The Original Pancake House,\" yet you feel they may still have this one nagging question:  \"I know what an Original House is, but  what the heck are pancakes?\"  I may have over-estimated the knowledge of the general population.  Again.)\n\nI suppose, if you're really, really hungry, say if you've just made bail, or you decided to end your month-long fast in protest of our nation's over-consumption of eggs, this place makes sense.  Otherwise?
