This is a nice organic spot in Matthews. It's in a mini shopping center and there is plenty of parking and nice stores nearby. It's pretty clean inside and relatively new. The prices are higher then your typical smoothie or juicing place, but they note it's clean which makes the price difference. For a smoothie your pay around $9.00 for a 16 ounce. From my understanding there aren't any reward programs. I have been on three separate occasions and nothing was mentioned or advertised. I had the intense one as my first drink which is pretty intense. The taste isn't pleasant, but I tried to think of the health benefits to scarf it down. I came back again to see if there was a difference in customer service etc. before writing the review. The second time I had the double one which was pleasantly refreshing and I recommend. The last time I had the chocolate one which is very chocolatey not my fav. It's nice that they offer an option of whey or hemp protein options. You can see them making your smoothie juice or bowl. The only problem I had was the wait time. It's painstakingly slow for no obvious reason. Two out of the three times I waited 15 minutes for a juice and they had more than two people working. Hmm not sure what the problem is here, but they can't handle a rush or crowd. Customer service is basic noting to note or mention.
