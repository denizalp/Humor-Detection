Living in Vegas for all these years, it was time to finally come here. They used to have a location at the M, but they closed down so we made the shlep across town in the hopes of experiencing a Vegas icon.\nSunday lunch time and line was out the door with the promise of seating after a 45 minute wait. We waited in the car since there wasn't much wait seating. Ok, busy place is always a good sign of good food, right? Well, maybe it's more about the GINORMOUS portions.\nAs you can already tell from the 2 stars, I was not at all impressed. However, I must give props to the friendly and cordial service we received from our server.\nClientele that day was mostly tatted up hipster crowd with piercings and stretched out lobes. To each their own.\nWe ordered a spicy Bloody Mary that was very good and perfect for a Sunday afternoon.\nWe've been on a fried chicken & waffles kick as of late and eager to try the sage chicken & waffles. The pictures of it show a tower of chicken stacked high on a huge plate. We thought sharing this enormous entr√©e would be the best option.\nWe were amused at the nearby table of 3 petite diners, each having their own tower of chicken & waffles. How ambitious.\nWe finally got ours and though the presentation looked impressive...it was a huge disappointment.\nThe chicken was soggy and skin was wet and fatty. The overall flavor of the sage and rosemary mixed into the batter was awful. We both choked down a couple bites but hated it. The waffle was ok with the bacon cooked into it, but not enough the redeem this nasty dish. This was the only thing on the menu that made Hash House a remote possibility for us, but after this experience we will definitely not return.
