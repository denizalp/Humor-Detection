Ambience: 5\nFood: 4 \nService by Monique D: 3 \nI could rate it an overall 4 stars but taking into account the type of restaurant this is and what I expected of it I shall give it 3 stars instead.\nMy pasta ai frutti di mare was delicious but the veal piccata just had too many capers for my taste. From that dish all I could taste was lemon and capers. \nAlso take into account that the dishes do not come with any sides; those you need to order separately. \nFor dessert I had their Gianduiotto and it was beautiful, refined and had a nice flavor\/texture combination. But would I order it again? Probably not. \nAs for the service I'd say it that although sufficiently efficient it was as impersonal as it can get. Monique D, at least three times, left me with half my question still being processed by my brain. That's unacceptable. She had two tables, both close, so I know it was not because she was 'on the weeds'. Was it because I'm young and look like I could also eat at Pizza Hut?\nTo top it off, when she dropped the bill, she had charged one of the items as if it had been dinner time and it was not. The difference was small of course but still a mistake. I did not tell her to fix it (she was not around much), nor did I tip her my usual 20%. Hope she gets better at her job, smiles once in a while or just considers changing her job.
