Tale of two clubs. This is my second least favorite club in Vegas. 1st is Pure. But this place....I think it's retarded packed. It looks like fire code violations everytime I come here. The place is definitely for show. If you don't have a table. Expect to be packed with people pushing and shoving just to get a drink. I think some of the bartenders are a little slow. Bottle service...is ok given that the cocktail waitress can fight through the persian empire. This place is usually a who's who of whos. But It's just not my thing. A. Some people smell... B. Some people stink. C. Boobies rub against you. D. Uh the opposite can do the same thing. It is a little dark in there. So when you get your girls out and they go from \"heey\"  to \"heeeey I'll be right back(RUN)\" Fridays they give away free stuff for women. Steve Madden Shoes, Glasses, purses, gift bags, etc.....Its funny because they come in. Get their free swag. Then run. MWAHAHAHA! Plus they don't pay cover cuz they use their sexuality to get in.....They pimp boys for drinks...Wow...am I anti women right now?\nI want a club where it's enjoyable to be at and hang out. If there's a 500 capacity don't make it 800. It's retarded. Well I have to admit. It is better than Baby's. Plus my VIP host there is pretty cool. Cooler than most. The problem is getting in. Ok it's a little hallway - no control of the crowd. Plus getting in and out of the Hard Rock is not the easiest thing to do if you park in the parking garage. Rehab is definitely much better. But remember Vegas - This week it's 110-116 degrees....HAWT
