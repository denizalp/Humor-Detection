I'm just not a Walmart type guy, I think the people who work there are all brainwashed and walk around the stores like zombies. I believe Sam Walton was a son of Satan. I believe Walmart is trying to take over the world. \n\nThis walmart is a \"SUPER Walmart\" meaning it fights crime and wears a cape, keeping Robinson safe from criminals. No just kidding, it means besides being a Walmart and a huge importer of products and clothing made in China, Viet Nam, and any other nation that keeps Mr and Mrs USA out of factory jobs, they are like a supermarket within a Walmart.\n\nThis Super Walmart, being so close to the boarder of Ohio and West by God Virginia gets quite a bit of cross state business. Why? Not sure, West Virginia has to be a hotbed for Walmart, like a Sheetz on every corner in Altoona. So expect quite a few oversized trucks with WVU, and \"My kid are a hi skool Gradyate\" sticker on the bumpers. \n\nIt's huge, busy, over crowded and I try to stay away from this hell hole as much as I can.
