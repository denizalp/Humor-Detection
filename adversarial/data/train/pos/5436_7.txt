When they are slow, they sure as hell are slow.\n\nWhy would people buy chatime in pacific mall when there are so many cheaper options? Go to every other place that offers the buy 1 get 1 free fresh mango slush for the price of 1 chatime. This chatime is busy most of the time, especially after school when all the hungry teens bus in from high school. The line moves so. so. so. slowly & what's worse is I don't know what's worse- the line to pay or the line to pick up your drink. Even when I'm the only one in line, it always take forever to get my drink. Bleh, I'm not paying $6 to have my time wasted?! \nThe drinks are consistent with every other chatime- obviously delicious, so no complaining over there. No chatime deserves a 1 star (except spawn of satan chatime richmond hill.. refer to that review after this) because their milk tea is oh so royal and they sure know how to brew their tea. \n\nThe servers here are nice too, no matter how slow they are.
