Last night I had the pleasure of taking an introductory group class here under the tutelage of studio owner Caroline. \n\nThe studio, which can be a tad tricky to find (and really the only drawback), is located on the second floor of the building towards the right hand side. My suggestion is to just look for the unit number which is on the same door as their logo. \n\nOnce our group arrived we were asked to fill in information forms and then pay for our class which would start soon. \n\nOnce completed we were swiftly brought out into the studio and we began. Caroline is a consummate professional and employs staff of the same caliber. Her and her staff seem to have a unique way of explaining the counts and steps in a way that's easy to understand for even the most 2 left footed individual (like me). Breaking each dance down into manageable chunks, we learned the basics of traditional Cuban Salsa and a Merengue. \n\nThe Salsa is a slightly more difficult dance once you get into it but I really enjoyed the Merengue especially as we were taught different spins and locks. Not gonna lie, as the rust fell off my hips I felt super sexy - not unlike a much younger Saturday Night Fever John Travolta!\n\nBefore we knew it our 45-minute class was over and we all looked around wanting more! That's a good thing - always leave-em wanting more!\n\nCan't wait to shake-ma-groove-thang at Blueheel again soon.
