We've never been to this location, and overall, it was fine. They were busy at 11:00 on a Sunday, but we got seated within 10 minutes, just as they had predicted. Service was fine, but not stellar. The coffee was a tad harsh, and I had to ask for water.  \n\nOur breakfasts were OK: I had the Trifecta, the idea of which I wish I would see more often on menus. It was a Belgian waffle, 2 eggs, and 2 pieces of bacon or sausage. My bacon was pretty over-done, and my over-easy eggs were slightly under-done. Think of me what you will for the next comment, but the cooks at Cracker Barrel *always* get the eggs and bacon right. The waffle was neither the best nor the worst I have ever had. Hubby had the bacon and avocado omelette, which he liked well enough. He was glad for the salsa, which he said made the dull potatoes more palatable.\n\nI don't think we'd ever make this First Watch a destination breakfast, but if we find ourselves hungry at the Promenade again, we might give it another chance.
