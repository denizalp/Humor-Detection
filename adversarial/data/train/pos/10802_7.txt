Weird service at drive through but I still love this place. \nCool location(right across from the park), huge variety of drinks, and good WIFI!!\n\nYou can come here and just sit in a corner for hours without being bothered on a comfy couch if you're lucky enough to score one. The coffee shop is very comfortable and even has outside seating for when Vegas weather allows you to enjoy the outdoors. \n\nThey have a ton of options when it comes to drinks and desserts. Great place to hit up if you have a sweet tooth.
