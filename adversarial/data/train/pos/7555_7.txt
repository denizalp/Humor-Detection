I am always excited to try new restaurants. I wasn't very excited to try this place and now I know why. I don't understand how so many people gave this place 4 or 5 stars. \n\nSo the menu selection was very disappointing. Ordered the mista salad and that was plain nothing special. ordered margherita \"cheese\" pizza which was very plain as well just nothing special but the 90 second cook time was pretty fabulous. Capellini pasta was nothing special as well just pasta with tomato sauce it seems. everything was overpriced for what you got. Overall not impressed and not worth a second visit in my opinion.
