Sandy is beyond wonderful as waitress. What a welcoming smile and quick service. Everything suggested was on point. Addis the bar tender was a great host and a warm hello as we came in. The place was empty (it is a Monday 7pm) and that was a scary 1st impression BUT the staff was so great that fear quickly went away. Salsa and chips are free and came out warm and crispy. We asked for suggestions for drinks and were offered samples. When it was brought out the order of samples was even suggested for the best results. Boy was she right! Up sale and smart move! We got street corn and guacamole for starters- let's just say wow! I was not expecting the corn to be soooo good! I'm kinda a street corn snob and not easily pleased but I might of just found my new local go to! The guacamole was huge- overflowing and fresh! We split a tortilla soup but it was good enough I could of had a bowl to myself! Spicy and full of beans and meat. Very pretty presentation. The street tacos are sold per taco- nice so you can get a full belly and not have to just have one flavor. Finished off with churro and vanilla ice cream with caramel. The vanilla bean was so flavorful! \nCan't say enough how nice of an evening and great food along with top notch service! \nWill be back! \nAlso bar filled up slowly as we were here and the atmosphere is relaxed and joyful
