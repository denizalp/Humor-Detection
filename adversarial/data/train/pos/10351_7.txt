Our community has been a customer of Brown Management for the past several years and what a breathe of fresh air they Re!  From our previous manager, Court Bickmore to our current manager, Raven Phillips, we have had exceptional care to keep things moving along and growing.  Both are extremely knowledgeable regarding HOA policies, procedures and governing statues.  Court assured a smooth transition as Raven took over and we couldn't be more pleased.  Raven is focused and gives exceptional attention to detail.  This company is all about customer service and we look forward to a long and fruitful relationship.
