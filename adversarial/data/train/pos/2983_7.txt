Delicious lil bagel shop!! Great breakfast bagels!! The Montreal one was my favorite! I totally agree these bagels are 100x better then American bagels! Lol! They are thinner and less bready then then US ones! You can eat it and not feels stuffed from carbs! \nCoffee was delicious as well.... special was a coffee and bagel sandwich for around $6, made me and my belly very happy! \nSide note they have one of those cool kinetic sculptures that move by the wind out front of here, very cool to watch!
