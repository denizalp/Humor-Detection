A regular haunt of mine. Great chill vibe, friendly fun staff, and the coffee couldn't be better. Food selections are a cut above considering it's just a coffee shop.\n\nBaristas call out your given name on loudspeaker so be sure to come up with a stupid fake name for everyone's amusement. \n\nFree Wi-Fi is a definite crowd draw. Tip: the \"linksys\" network is actually faster and more reliable than Aroma's network.
