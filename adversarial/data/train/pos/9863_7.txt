Went here today for lunch! Have been here multiple times though and always have a great experience! Great food, casual atmosphere, good prices, and excellent customer service. \n\nToday I got my favorite BBQ bacon cheddar burger with sweet potatoes fries. Everything is cooked fresh so it comes out super hot, melted cheese, and amazing! Their fries are also always super fresh. If you like sweet potatoes fries then you will love them!! They serve most burgers on an egg bun and it's super good. Always very fresh and super hot. Really adds great taste to the burger. I have gotten the buffalo burger before and also a create your own and it's all delicious. \n\nIts at a great location with a ton of tables but can get busy during lunch hours so I usually try to beat the rush. The restaurant is also very clean and the staff is always walking around asking to pick up your stuff when your finished. I'm amazed at the customer service here! Definitely recommend if you want a hot tasty burger.
