I've dined in and ordered carry-out from Thai House, but I seem to get more food when I carry out. Their Spicy Fried Rice is phenomenal. There is so much flavor and it is the best Spicy Fried Rice that I've had in the valley. To make it vegan-friendly, I order it with tofu and veggies, and omit the eggs. They will charge an additional $2 to get tofu & veggies; they will not allow you to order 1\/2 tofu and 1\/2 veggies, for some reason.  However, the only thing that truly peeves me is the spice level. Every time I've ordered, I have requested to have spice level 5, which is their hottest, but I end up with mild food every time. I am truly confused by this. I can always depend on Thai cuisine to deliver true spice, but they must be serving up some American, watered down version of spices.  If they can fix the spice issue, I'll be happy. I need it spicy!
