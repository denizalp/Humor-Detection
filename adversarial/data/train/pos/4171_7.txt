Being on a No Meat Diet makes you think outside the box sometimes when your accustomed to being an omnivore.....so, when we were looking around for a place to grab some lunch a friend suggested we stop by Sweet Tomatoes.  It has been over 10 yrs since I've been to one, so I thought why not.\n\nWe arrived just before the lunch rush at 11:30 am.  There was a short line, but nothing crazy.  I piled a bunch of Salad and Pasta Salad on my plate and then made the rounds over to the Bread section.\nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/NZAxQxXH0YkSzPOKd_Nv-w?select=jRysLhaB-0yg5Wa2EYYQsw\nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/NZAxQxXH0YkSzPOKd_Nv-w?select=L3xqRAzbnoT7e2khkOUW6w\nThe food was very good, tasty and satisfying.  I went back to grab a small bowl of Mac n Cheese too, which was ok.\n\nI had a coupon for 2 for $9.99, so it was a great deal.  Overall, the meal was perfect and I left full.\n\nReturn Factor - 90%
