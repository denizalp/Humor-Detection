Sorry, but I have to update my review and it's not going to be the good kind. I've rarely come out of a massage feeling worse than I came in...\n\nLet's start with the positive: the place is quiet, with semi-private rooms, and a clean bathroom. For an asian foot spa, that is an incredible feat. Also, the employees we encountered in person and on the phone were all friendly. Star here, star there. They love trying to up-sell though, which gets annoying. Other places already include hot stones for the same price.\n\nHere's what ruined it for me -- my masseuse. It's like a lottery. This review is solely for a short, older lady named LILY (or Lee-lee?). If you want to have your hair tousled for extended amounts of time and be lightly petted like a cat for an hour, then by all means, go request her. Otherwise, just have your significant other or grandma give your hair a better rubdown for free. What a waste of money and a massage. Like literally, Lily would simply graze her fingers over your skin like she's reading Braille. \n\nWhen she flips you over, she'll kneel on your butt putting her whole body weight into you and haphazardly move her arms like she's a DJ spinning bad mixes on your back. Don't say I didn't warn you. This lady is totally inept.
