Man, I love this place!! It's the perfect place to go for a night out. The comedians are amazing- I can't say that I've seen a bad one in the dozens of times i've been and who doesn't love to laugh?? The food is a touch overpriced for Tempe, but it's nice to sit and chat for awhile with an appetizer before the comedians come on stage. \n\nMy favorite place to sit for a date\/2 person party: in the back of the showroom at the high-top tables. Then you can  have some private conversation - at the tables on the floor, they seat in 4s, so if you go with a date, you will end up sitting with 2 other people- can be good for conversation, but that depends on the people you're next to.
