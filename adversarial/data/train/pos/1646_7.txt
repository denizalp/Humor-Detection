The games are a lot of fun and I really like the stadium.  I can't say that I'm a fan because I'm a fan of another unnamed West Coast team.  I've taken my Son to a few games and we enjoy watching baseball live.  There's nothing like sitting in a ballpark and eating junk food.\n\nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/1Df5Rln6AhH27G0P1uGGIQ?select=xKGCL4hmRRiVUWTuT8Pl2A\nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/1Df5Rln6AhH27G0P1uGGIQ?select=HsScWMqu1ggU7KN4ieZzJg\nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/1Df5Rln6AhH27G0P1uGGIQ?select=m59Ldfx3vBesansCqSfE9Q\n\nReturn Factor - 100%
