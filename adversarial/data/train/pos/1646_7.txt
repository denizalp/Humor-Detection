Located at the Forum Food Court at Caesars Palace, this little express counter was actually one of the better choices.  Before deciding on this place, across the way, the cashier lady at Earl of Sandwich told me \"Someone put an order of 100 sandwiches, and are you willing to wait over 30 minutes for your order?\"  Um, \"NO\" I'll go to Phillips.  \n\nNow, as far as I know, Phillips is a well known favorite originating in the Baltimore area.  While residing in the Bay Area and being spoiled with San Francisco's seafood, this joint had better live up to the eastcoast hype.  \n\nThe two cashiers at the counter were nice and gave us samples of the clam chowder and cream of crab.  We opted for the chowder, as the cream of crab was a bit like drinking seawater.  The chowder however seemed a bit better with pieces of clams, cube cuts of potatoes, and small pieces of bacon (small cup, $6.49).  Decent, but not up to SF standards.  I didn't order a drink, but asked about the fountain drinks and was told $4.95.  Eeek, what a waste!  I'll gamble at a table and tip a dollar.  No thank you.  \n\nWe also ordered a Classic Lobster Roll ($14.99), because it's the most expensive thing on the menu board.  It's my first time, so I had to try what they're \"known for\".  Now, the cool part was seeing the meaty claw parts, and it wasn't overpowering with the mayo.  It was tasty it, but actually the kicker was the seasoned waffle fries.  I'm in agreement with all the other reviews that these were SFG, \"So Freakin' Good!\"  \n\nSo in conclusion, was it a good representation for the eastcoast?  Probably so!  Would I come back here?  Probably, but only if I were at one of their real locations in Baltimore.  It's worth a try in my opinion, or you can opt to wait in the long line at Earl of freakin' 100 Sandwiches.
