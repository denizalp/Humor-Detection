The chef owner was extremely rude.  He was also delusional.  He said that he thinks ramen is for trashy backpackers only.  So that is why he stops serving it at 4 pm to get the riff raff out.  He thinks his place with anime on the wall and home made decorations in a college district will magically turn into a classy joint at 4 pm because he won't serve ramen.  If he doesn't like serving college students then he should not have picked a location right across from UNLV.
