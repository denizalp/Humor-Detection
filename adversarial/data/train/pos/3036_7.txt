Not Good Disappointing\n\nThis was my first visit to Fuego Taco Shop.  In my opinion  the food just isn't very good. On this visit my lunch companion and I ordered the asada and al pastor tacos,  we were both very disappointed with our entrees.\n\nMy lunch companion told me that her pastor tacos were flavorless.  To be perfectly honest, the tacos looked flavorless. The carne asada taco consisted of chunks of flavorless beef in a warm tortilla and the tortilla didn't look very appealing. \n\nThe tacos just did not have a lot of flavor, were slightly overcooked, and just had a strange unappetizing taste.  The food  just wasn't very good.
