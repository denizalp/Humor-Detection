Their staff is rude and inattentive. The manager we spoke to was no better. He looked to be about 1-3 years older than me and talked rudely from the get go. When he didn't like what I had to say, he copped an attitude. Go f*ck yourself. We are done here. At that point shut up and get my bill, like I told you. So we can pay and leave instead of argue and hear about your regulations. We DONT care. You're refusing to satisfy the customer, so walk away. This guy just stood there and argued until I cursed at him. Personally, I don't give a shit, that was your bad.\n\nYou guys really would rather fight about a $10 groupon than keep repeat customers? That is fine with me. It's very simple to pick another good pizza joint (Recommend Oregano's.) We will just never be back and I'll refund my groupon. Enjoy the $20. It's the last you'll see from me \/ anyone I know. \n\nI USED to come here several times a month. I will never visit another mellow mushroom. The food is good but is outrageous in price. If you need anything from the staff, good luck. \n\nI don't give a damn about the Groupon. Unlike Mellow, they have fantastic customer service.
