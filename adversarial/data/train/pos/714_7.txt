The night we went in there, it was toward the end of their 'season' - I guess they close down for the summer.  There was NO air-conditioning (it was totally miserable in there - but we had driven a long way to get there), and when I went to use the ladies room, it reeked of sewer gas.  Pee-Yoo!!!  \n\nIt is a very overpriced restaurant, including their food and appetizers, and we even used a Groupon.  We were talked into Squash Buttons for our appetizer - $16.00 for a plate that had just 2 Buttons.  \n\nI can't recall what my entree was, or my husband's - that's how memorable it was.  We will DEFINITELY not be going back; we don't care if they offer up a thousand more Groupons (which I see that there is one currently).
