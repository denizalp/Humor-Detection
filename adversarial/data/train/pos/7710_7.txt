About a month ago, I started craving Las Vegas's Rio's Seafood Buffet out of the blue. Good thing I was slated to run the Vegas marathon a few weeks later. \n\nAs the race day neared, I thought more and more about the obscene quantity of seafood I would consume once I finished my marathon. After all, one of the perks of running 26.2 miles is that you get to eat whatever you want before and after the race without feeling an ounce of guilt (at least in theory).\n\nThus, to my mild disappointment, the seafood buffet never really lived up to what I expected it to be. Surprising, because I've been here before--Oh how I've been here before... \n\nI'd say this was my 6th or so visit to the seafood buffet, and in all honesty, I don't know why I keep coming back. At $39.99 + tax and tip, it's hardly a bargain. I mean, if their seafood was the best I've ever had, I might not mind, but it's \"good\" at best...not even \"great\".\n\nYes, they have baby lobster tails, hot and cold crab legs, deep fried scallops-clams-shrimp, as well as an assortment of sushi, but at the end of the day, it's all seafood I could live without, especially at that price.
