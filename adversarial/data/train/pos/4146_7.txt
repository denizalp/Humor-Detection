My husband and I went to this place for our wedding anniversary today and we got a couples massage. The people at the front desk were very nice. The facility was clean and had a great soothing environment. The couples room had a nice setup. The therapists were also very nice and welcoming. My massage was good, except the pressure was very varied. I asked for medium pressure and sometimes I was wincing and sometimes it was very light. My husband asked for firm pressure and it wasn't firm enough so then he asked for firmer pressure but it still wasn't what he wanted. I think what bothered me the most was my husband had to use the restroom in the middle of the session and his therapist asked him if he \"couldn't just hold it?\" No! When you have to pee you have to pee. How are you supposed to enjoy the rest of your massage when your bladder is screaming at you that you need to pee. I just thought it was inconsiderate. My therapist finally told that therapist to just get him a robe so he could go. Duh. So she did and he did and the rest of the massage was okay.
