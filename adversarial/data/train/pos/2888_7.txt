Ok, lets be honest. Casinos are places of desperation, seedy experiences, lost dreams, and just downright hilarity. I love casinos. I am in no way a compulsive gambler, addict, or junky of any sort so I feel my reviews of casinos can be quite frank and honest from an outsiders perspective.\n\nThis place sucks!!!\n\nIt is filled with people hooked up to respirators with their filthy wigs and blue hairs. There is nothing \"bling\" about this place and its genuinely old, dirty, and depressing. \n\nThe slot machines are a haven for old timers to pump away their social security checks and their grandchildrens inheritance. The machines don't pay out and when you win more than 200 bucks it has to be hand delivered to you. \n\nIndians casinos always suck  - this place is no exception.
