Oh yes they did open a new beer shop right next to the wine shop in Downtown Matthews! Yay!\n\nCarolina beer temple has a huge selection of bottled beers from around the world. Some are available from their beer cooler, so I imagine you can stay to enjoy it there if you like. There are also maybe a dozen beers on draft - from unique imports to our local QC\/NC breweries. They offer all the drafts in a small-medium-or-large size, which is good if you'd like to create your own sampler. \n\nInside there are some tables, chairs, a couch and seating at the bar - there's also a small patio with 4-5 tables if the weather is nice.\n\nThe owners are very friendly and happy to chat and help you make your choice. I do hope they decide to extend their hours, I think 9pm closing time is too early for the weekend!
