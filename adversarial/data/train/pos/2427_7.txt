For the Central Phoenix area, I consider this to be one of the bigger and better sports bars. They have obviously put some serious thought and effort toward the design and maintenance of both the interior and the patio spaces. The staff is very attentive and friendly, the establishment is conveniently located south of the Town and Country complex, parking is no problem, and of course there are more than enough TV screens for sports fans.  This is definitely one sports bar I'd recommend to friends for viewing sports and enjoying drinks and good bar food at reasonable prices - especially if they enjoy dining, drinking, and socializing in a patio, as this has one of the better and more spacious sports bar patio spaces in the city.
