Iceman Cooling & Heating is a great business! We had an AC Unit die last night. I called Iceman and spoke with Seth this morning and he was able to expedite service for us and had someone here the same day. The service technician Justin was very knowledgeable and immediately diagnosed the issue. He replaced a part, ran some diagnostics, and had us cooling down in under an hour. Too top it off, the price was much less than I had anticipated paying. \n\nI would highly recommend Iceman to a friend, family or anyone with AC needs.
