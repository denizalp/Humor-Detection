Wow! I love this place!!\n\nThis place (esthetically) is like something straight out of a magazine shoot- Heavenly white, modern chic interior, so immaculately clean you could probably eat off the floor...well you get the picture.\n\nI could have spent hours here...Oh wait, I did...lol Yes, I spent some time indulging in some fabulously wonderful drinks and chatted with the exceptionally friendly bartender about all the wonderful things in life such as famous people, boyfriends...ect\n\nMy first drink was one of there signature cocktails called Berry bliss...It was a heavenly, refreshing concoction of blueberry and raspberry liquor along with fresh muttled berries, orange juice topped with two beautiful succulent berries on top. It was perfect for the hot Vegas weather.\n\nI also had a Lemon drop that was made to perfection! Sweet, tart and abundantly flavorful I also tried one of there signature Mojitos which was fab!!\n\nThey also have an outside seating area overlooking the strip that is also is fab!! The drinks are quite pricey at $12 to $14.oo a drink but to me it was worth every extra indulgent dollar and my bartender \"Ice\" made my visit all the more enjoyable!!\n\nGosh....I already miss Vegas!!!
