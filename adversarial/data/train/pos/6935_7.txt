Eggplant wins! Eggplant wins!\nEating here is awesome. The man that owns this is so nice. He always gives the girls at the table a little stuffed animal. He says for the kid in  you. Im SERIOUS!\n\nThe food is fresh, crisp, flavorful.\nMakes you want to eat healthy all the time!\nGreat for a quick lunch, it takes just the right amount of time to come out. Not too soon where you wonder if it has sat under a heat lamp all day. \n\nThe water is good, not like some places here where you can taste the pipes. \n\n\nLOVE THIS PLACE.\nWISH THEY WOULD OPEN ONE IN GOOD OLD COUNTRY TOWN MESA\/APACHE JUNCTION...HINT HINT!\n\nKeep up the good work.\nI wish they would replace all Mcdonalds with you!
