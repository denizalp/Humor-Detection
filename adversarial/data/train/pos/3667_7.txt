WATER SLIDES. I'M ALMOST 32 AND I STILL LOVE WATER SLIDES. \n\nThis place isn't the largest water park I've been to, but they set it up well logistically and their discounted twilight deal lured me and my family to this location. \n\nA huge plus is the fact that you don't have to spend extra money on inner tube rentals. They have designated ones for each ride, including the lazy river (pr whatever they call it). Not sure if it's like that for the day time, but that's how it worked at night. \n\nThe lines moved quickly and each ride had a fun factor that got the adrenaline pumping. Will definitely be back on our next family visit to Las Vegas.
