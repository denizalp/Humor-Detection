\"I'm so glad we went there. That was THE best time I've ever had at a strip club in Vegas.\" - My date. Two days later. \n\nBut this isn't a review about how awesome I am to go to strip clubs with.\n\nThe Rhino was definitely fun, though.  We went during March Madness so it was PACKED and we luckily were able to snag one of the last tables in the place. Despite their obvious crowd of testosterone fueled NCAA fans, the girls still came around to our table of two couples VERY often and were super friendly and cute. I shared a bond with them because apparently my legs were stripper-smooth. I guess strippers have the monopoly on super smooth legs and when they find a girl that cracked their code it's like we're all in some kind of secret society together, which I obviously will take as a compliment.\n\nI can't say anything for how much anything cost (as it should be when it comes to women going to strip clubs), but the fact that my date paid for everything and then said it was the best time he'd ever had makes me feel like it was fair. I will say that if you come here, bottle service is probably worth it. I can't imagine having as good of a time without a table and the way drinks are priced everywhere in Vegas, bottles usually don't end up being much more than what you'd pay to drink all night anyway.\n\nAll in all, I had a great time, he had a great time, you'll probably have a great time. Oh, and ladies, use a Mach 3. That Venus shit is for amateurs.
