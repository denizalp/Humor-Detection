I first went to a dentist office somewhere around the age of  3 or 4 when an ambitious and fearless version of myself jumped from a jungle gym and proceeded to bash my face into my knee and with that my teeth into my lips. \n\nMy dentist at that point was the closet to that park in Thornhill and fast forward 20 years I had continued to see him, however I found him to be impersonal and I almost always feared my trip to visit him.  It was about this time 3 years ago that i realized my long time dentist was too far away and it was time for a change. \n\nA new office had opened near my home in the Humberlands plaza, in Richmond Hills north end (Oak Ridges) and I decided to give it a shot. Entering in for my first time I was greeted by the friendly voice and  beautiful smile of Kori the office administrator. I made an appointment for later that week and the rest, as they say, is history!\n\nDr. Tom Markou is the best! By far one of the easiest guys to talk with and an appointment with him is never rushed, and without some talk of sports, career or a good laugh. I feel totally comfortable with him.\n\nIn addition to Kori and Dr. Markou, the hygienists are equally talkative and friendly - a joy to talk to (or mumble to while your mouth is full of tools, gauze, and fingers). \n\nThey've digitized the entire dental process down to your X-rays which they use a special digital receiver for to upload the images to a computer instantly. Only the latest equipment is used and everything is sterile. \n\nMy fave thing? The ceiling mounted televisions above your chair which they give you the remote control for once you are seated so you can distract yourself with some mindless entertainment while someone \"roots\" around in your mouth. \n\nPro-Tip: They alternate working on Friday and Saturday's so when making appointments know that they work one week Friday and then one week saturday
