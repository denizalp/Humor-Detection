I wish i could have this food without ever having to come in to this restaurant. I seriously dread having to come here but my love of Hakka style asian food keeps bringing me back. Why the dread? For one thing, the service is really, really lacking. The people who work here almost seem upset that they have to deal with you; frustrated with the notion that you being there is making them have to work and do their job. I guess what really gets their blood boiling is the fact that, above all else, you want to give them your hard-earned money (ok, that's probably the only thing they are looking forward to). If you are looking to dine in, expect to spend 10-15 minutes waiting for food so allocate your lunch break accordingly (might want to call in earlier and make an order). Once you get the food though, you can expect it to be rather good.\n\nI seriously don't get this place, it has so much potential. If they put any effort into their service and ensuring people walk away pleased, they would be much busier at lunch on a weekday in an area that is lacking quality asian joints.
