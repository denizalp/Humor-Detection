I've been going to Hammam for years for one thing and one thing only:  facials ($130 plus tip) from Ashley.  I've been to a lot of spas, and she is as skilled as they come.  I love the steam room when it's not full of chatty bitches and gross men sighing and groaning like they're at the Oakwood men's only Steam Bath, if you catch my drift.  And the towels have shrunk over the years, which makes things a little more exciting than they need to be.\n\nThe spa itself is gorgeous and smells like eucalyptus and freshly bathed babies, although the change room floors are sometimes a little dirty\/hairy which freaks me out, and is really kind of unacceptable at these prices.
