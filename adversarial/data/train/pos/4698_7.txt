**3.5 stars** (I give overall a 3\/5 because the line is not worth it the next time).\n\nSooooo finally found some time to check this out after breaking the promise to myself to visit during their opening week.  As we walked down Baldwin looking for Kinton, we peeked at the plates of patio dwellers of other restaurants.  Then at the end of the street, I noticed something and said, \"That must be it, the one with the line out front.\"  We were quoted an hour's wait, so decided to grab a drink at the sushi patio next door.\n\nWe were sat in under an hour in the deep narrow restaurant where there is one communal table out front, a long bar in the middle over looking the open kitchen and workers, and 2 more tables at the back.  I was so happy to see fresh ramen noodles being cooked in front of me, but so sad that they have not yet acquired their liquor license.  \n\nCheese Ramen: $9-10?? (3.5 stars)\nI love cheese and I love ramen, I have no excuse to not order this!  I opted for the pork belly instead of pork butt because... well, fat=flavour right?  I watched as the shredded swiss is generously mounded on my heaping bowl of fresh noodles, and whispered, \"Ooohhh Yeaaahhh\".  The light miso broth is pretty good, but a tad salty (possibly due to the addition of cheese).  The noodles are better than Kenzo's though.  What I was really disappointed with was the ONE piece of pork belly!! Since when was ONE piece of bacon ever enough?!?!\n\nShio Ramen: $9.50 (4\/5 stars)\nSea salted broth (light, as oppose to rich... whatever that meant as an option), served with pork butt slices, a soft boiled egg and nori.  The broth was okay, but the noodles was delish once again!  The egg perfectly cooked as the whites were firm to enclose the delicate yolk that seeps out once you break it... Mmm.  Then this is where I go, \"this is NOT FAIR!\".  Although we are given the choice of either pork shoulder or pork belly, they come in different amounts.  If you get pork belly, you get one thick piece, if you get pork shoulder, you get 4-5 thick slices.  Hmmm.....??\n\nSpicy Chicken Karaage: $4something (3\/5 stars)\nIncredibly juicy and loved the batter, but at the end of the day, it's just pieces of fried dark meat chicken with some spicy sauce.  \n\nService: (4\/5 stars)\nA little slow with the arrival of the first dish.  Greeted with the attitudes of Guu as everyone is being sat, each order was shouted harmoniously as each dish came up to the pass.  Our server didn't really speak English but got by.  They were all very attentive and patient.  Since we were one of the last tables to be sat, we were also the last to leave.  Right till the very end, all the staff showed so much enthusiasm and greeted us goodbye as if we were their first customers.\n\nI like their noodles a lot, but I like Kenzo's broth better.  Comparing the atmosphere between the two would be like comparing apples to oranges, so I won't even bother.  I am definitely coming back to Kinton for their beer cocktails once they have their LLBO, but I think my go-to is still Kenzo just because it's a bit more relaxed, more options, and rarely a wait.
