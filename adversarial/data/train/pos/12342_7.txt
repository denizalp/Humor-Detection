DO NOT GO NEAR THESE GUYS....THEY ARE CRIMINALS!!!!!\nThey are the worst moving company that we ever used. \nGave us a quote for four guys and three only showed up. \nThey were late....needed cash before they started. \nThen once the truck was loaded they said we needed to pay cash NOW or they were going to unload the whole truck on the street in front of our condo that we were moving from. \nBroken items, overcharged, inefficient (don't think two of the guys had any previous moving experience) and rude (particularly Nadia who lied through the entire awful experience).\nI used these guys cause I thought I could save a buck but ended up paying double what Nadia said it would be.
