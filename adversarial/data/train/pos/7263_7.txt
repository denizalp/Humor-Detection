Absolutely would never bring my own personal pets here. Had a friend come in with her dog, utter and total rip off. They're in cahoots with Banfield Pet Smart. Long story short and $3000 later, friends dog had surgery that night and doctor wasn't thorough enough. Dog went to another vet that wasn't Banfield for after care and as a result of a botched surgery, the new vet had to finish what this surgeon missed. Utter failure. They work off of a corporate scale and it's like if you don't have the money, your pet will basically die. They absolutely don't work finances with you. It's decisions that will either break your heart or your finances. Never again. By the way, Banfield Pet Insurance is a scam. Beware!
