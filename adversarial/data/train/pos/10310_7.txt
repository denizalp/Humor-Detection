I have been coming to Dental Specialty Associates for about a year.   They are always very professional and courteous.  Appointments are available early in the day before work, which is not always common.  \n\nThis place has new technology, the procedures are painless, xrays are quick, they offer good advice for practical day to day care and provide good samples.  All of my check-ups have been easy and painless.  I had a deep cleaning and a standard cleaning here, which I thought they did a great job on both.   Appointments were quick and on time. \n\nThe only things that surprised me were   1)  I had to schedule a follow up appointment for cleaning. I figured it would have been done all in one appointment.  and 2) Deep cleaning was not covered fully by my insurance.   Be sure to ask when you schedule so you know what to expect.  The second time I went back, I just had the standard cleaning and no issues at all.   They may recommend different products, but it's up to you to choose.  No different than anywhere else i have been before.\n\nI had billing questions and my calls from DSA were returned promptly -  the staff are very polite, attentive and helpful.   While I duked things out with my insurance compnay, DSA was patient and understanding.\n\nHonestly, I'm surprised at the ratings here.  I have not had any problems at all. I have been to four or five different dental offices in the valley that were horrible prior to finding DSA.  I recommend DSA to co-workers and friends.
