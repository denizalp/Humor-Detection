New location with a drive through. Staff is below average with their service but the food is great. The grilled chicken, beef and ribs with the teriyaki sauce are amazing. White rice is cooked very well and taste great with the teriyaki sauce, too. Fried white fish is also a hit. Coke products, Hawaiian drinks and iced tea are your drink options.
