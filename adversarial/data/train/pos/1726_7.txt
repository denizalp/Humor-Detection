Well obviously the owners response is to this incident is very limited and is one sided. There is a motto that successful companies follow, \"the customer is always right\". This is where ownership and management fail. \n\nYou see I called in advance searching for a solution. My fan downrod was too long. I was actually looking for an accessory for a shorter downrod. Since I called ahead and spoke to someone at Fanco , I explained in detail what my issue was.   The Fanco rep then recommend that if I bring in the part , they can actually cut the downrod shorter. That was it. \nI thought what a wonderful Idea. My mistake was to have gone to the wrong store where I was encountered by their rude representative. It was his whole explanation was condescending and rude. The logic in why they wont help me made no sense. They made it seem more like , if you dont buy here, we wont help you. \n\nIf it was such a big deal claiming liability   , then say so during my initial call. Its called DISCLOSURE.  It keeps any company out of trouble. This is where Fanco failed. If when I spoke to the Fanco rep that offered to cut the downrod for me and he disclosed that they only offer the service to their own products then I wouldn't be wasting my time here. I would have more respect for that, coming from Fanco than having me be treated like and Idiot after they screwed up. Even after all that , the right thing to do customer service wise would have to just do what they initially offered to do and know that next time they need to be carful what they offer with out disclosure. \n\nIf I buy a piece of lumber anywhere I can walk into any store and have it cut with no questions asked. Its called \"customer service\".
