I love eggs no matter how it's made. It could be scrambled, boiled, poached, or pan fried. I love them all. My favorite is over easy, if you're wondering. When I saw this place on Yelp, I knew I had to try it.\n\nThis place wasn't too hard to find on S Eastern Ave. It was on our way to The Hoover Dam. Once we got there, the workers were really nice. The restaurant was about half full so we got seated quickly. Our server brought us the menus and asked if it was our first time. We told her that it was and she promptly got us two banana nut muffins. The bread was warm and moist. I just slathered it with butter. It was yummy goodness.\n\nIt took a while to browse over the menu as it was quite extensive. I decided to stick with my tried and true, the Traditional Benny. Two grilled English muffins topped with Canadian bacon, with two poached eggs smothered in hollandaise sauce. It came with a side of Habla Diablo seasoned potatoes. How could you go wrong with this? Of course you can't. It tasted just as good as it sounds. The entree was huge. The eggs were perfectly cooked and the hollandaise sauce didn't separate. The potatoes were so so. I like my potatoes crispy and this wasn't. I would have preferred crispy hash browns instead.\n\nThe hubby had some kind of turkey skillet breakfast. Turkey is not listed on the menu for the skillets. If you ask for it, they can make it. He really enjoyed it. I never got a chance to taste it. I was busy working on my own plate. I couldn't finish, so he ate my other benny muffin.
