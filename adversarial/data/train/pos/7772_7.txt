Chai!  After days of thinking about it, I finally had chai.  I feel really guilty that I hadn't been here before, since I can literally walk here.  \nComfy couches, lots of tables!  One even had a gigantic checkers game on it.  \nThree huge video screens on the wall.  I'm not sure what mood the owner was in last night, but it was all Madonna (yeah, bitches!), Shakira and Britney videos.  OMG she did a remake of \"I Love Rock n Roll\" which really pisses me off.  *grumble*\nAnyway, they have a pretty big menu.  Their hours are awesome:  They're open till midnight during the week and 24\/7 on weekends.   FTW!  Now I know I have somewhere to go late at night for a hunk of cheesecake.\nThis place needs some decor.  I mean, the pointsettia was nice and all, but what happens after Xmas?  Walls are bare except for the screens playing girl-pop.  \nThey make all their own desserts (except for the muffins) and have a large coffee\/tea menu.  \nI'll be back.  If I see that Britney video again, though, I will slay kittens.
