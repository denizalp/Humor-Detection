Schooled in Napoli but not beholden to its rigid regulations. Sourced locally and allowed to be as creative as our current tastes. In short another great addition to a city already steeped in world class pizza.  The place has a non pretentious  community feel and it gets added points for having a parking lot that hasn't been commandeered by Valet profiteers.
