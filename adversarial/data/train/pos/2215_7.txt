Given all the CVS \/ Walmarts were banned from selling alcohol during the July 4th weekend, ABC Stores was a welcome beacon....esp as it was only a 15 min walk from our hotel!\n\nGood assortment of Champers, ranging from the nasty $6.99 variety to a $59 Veuve Clicquot.  Our merry group chose a decently priced Chandon & were well on our way to enjoying the fireworks from our comfy, cool room\n\nAll kinds of snacks, chips, candies & whatnot to enjoy w\/ your drinkys & they had alcohol & non-alcoholic alike\n\nSure you're paying a bit more but after walking around all day & not willing to actually get your car our of the garage to find a cheaper spot, the price is well worth the convenience
