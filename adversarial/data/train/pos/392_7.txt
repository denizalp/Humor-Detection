Guys! This place is amazing, and I'm about to tell you how to make it more amazing!!\n\nOnly at Las Vegas and Atlantic City locations do they have the \"Distinctive Dining\" deal. $50 for 3 courses.\n\nStep one... Cut a hole in the box! Kidding. Okay, go to the website and print out their special menu because It's ONLY VALID IF YOU HAVE THE PAPER!\nNot valid on holidays, but still valid on weekends. \n\nStep two...\n-order your first course, lobster bisque or salad. Both were fantastic. More deets later. \n- order your entree, and yes. An 8 oz filet is an option. What. Is. Happening.\n- pick your side, which is big enough to feed THREE people. \n- pick yo' dessert- bread pudding, chocolate mousse, or creme brûlée \n\nStep three... Stuff your face and be amazed by how wonderful the food is. \n\nStep four... Pat yourself on the back for enjoying a three-course meal at Vic and Anthony's for $50. Then go blow some money gambling as you waddle off your food baby. \n\nFood:\n- Lobster bisque 5\/5- wasn't too salty and had sweet chunks of lobster meat!\n- Filet- 4\/5- had an excellent crust on it but wasn't cooked to medium rare. One of us ended up with medium, and the other ended up with half and half. Still tastes fabulous. \n- Creamed spinach- 2\/5- omggg soooo much cheese in this that I wasn't sure if I was trying to convince a 5 year old to eat vegetables by hiding them in cheese. Are we eating cheese in spinach or spinach in cheese? Couldn't stomach it.\n- Au gratin potatoes- 3\/5- the guys loved these, but soooooo much cheese again. A few bites of this, and you'll be set for the next famine. \n- Bread pudding 5\/5- the silkiest bread pudding I've ever had. \n- Chocolate mousse- 5\/5 comes on a thin crispy layer. Fantastic flavor and texture. \n- creme brûlée- 5\/5 while a little thin, fabulous presentation with tons and tons of brûlée for you to eat with berries. \n\nSo basically, just say yes to all of the above in this gorgeous, glamorous old school restaurant. \n\nVic and Anthony's, thanks for the affordable and splendid dinner. I love you. Or y'all, I suppose, since there are two of you.
