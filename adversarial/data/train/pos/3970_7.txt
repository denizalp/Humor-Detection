So went in to get my Infiniti QX56 diagnosis.  One hour later the guy tells me the mechanic couldn't get a true diagnosis, he needs more time like 4 hours more. The price for diagnosis is now $700 from 150.  But they state they are not trying to rip off customers.  If you are trying to go and spend money and not get your car fixed this place will be the spot.  This is why everyone hates going to the dealership because of this reason.
