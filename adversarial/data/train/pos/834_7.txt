We were looking for a new breakfast to go. After searching Yelp for recommendations, we decided to pick this place! We were very excited about trying this place with the amazing reviews and gorgeous presentation of food. \n\nWhen we (table of 2 adults and a 18 month old) arrived, most of the tables already had their food and the restaurant was not filled yet. We sat down around 10AM, we ordered our food around 10:10AM. After our waitress took our order, she never revisited our table. We had to wave down the other staff to refilled our coffee and waters. Our last refill of coffee was the bottom of the coffee pot, so it was pretty much grinds and 1\/2 a cup. After sitting around for over 40 mins and seeing how other tables (table of 4, table of 2 and a table of 1) that sat down after us get their food... we decided to ask about food. Our waitress's response was \"I asked for your food\" and shrugged. That's when we decided that we can't wait any longer. We asked for our check and left. We had a 18 month old with us that was getting restless and hungry.  It's a shame that we all had to leave hungry.
