Another ice cream joint that I've been frequenting since childhood. \n\nCooper's is unique in a few ways. Besides just your run of the mill chocolate\/vanilla twist they offer a raspberry\/vanilla twist. SO GOOD!!! It's even better with that Krunch Kote krap on top. (I almost typed Krunk Kote). \n\nCooper's is usually really busy with all of the Greaselake baseball kids running around. So try to go mid-day or before the games are over.
