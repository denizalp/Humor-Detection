When dining with picky eaters and vegetarians, CPK always seems to be the safest place to go.  I frequent this specific CPK a few times a year due to birthdays and mini-reunions and it's always the same:  Super busy, hot food, alcohol-infused drinks, and a good time.\n\nWhile the place is usually packed and wait time on a Saturday night varies between 30-45mins, service is usually decent and the tables and utensils are always clean.  A short wait isn't so bad in the company of great friends.  Food is pretty standard affair.  In the end, you're really just paying for the name and a standard pizza with fresh ingredients.  My usual go-to's are the Thai Chicken hand tossed, Tostada thin crust, and the Garlic cream Fettuccine.  Yum.
