*  Welcome Experience\n-  Blatantly Bad\n\nHad the same obnoxious vibe as the decor.  I actually got the impression that the hostesses thought we were lucky to be there.  It's odd, like the employees are \"drinking the kool-aid!  \n\n*  Establishment\n-  Blatantly Bad\n\nThis place was obnoxious!  Even for Vegas!  Figure out what you're going to be!  And when you do, STOP taking yourselves so seriously!  The endless photos and looping videos of this owner were over the top obnoxious.  I thought it was humor at one point.  Ugh. \n\n*  Service\n-  Discouraging\n\nThe staff seemed indifferent, until I started asking questions about the owner and the decor.  They CAME TO LIFE talking about the \"story\" of the owner who started as a DJ and spoke so fondly of him.  It was a bit off-putting really.  Then I asked for a substitution and they gleefully pointed at the NO SUBSTITUTIONS banner at the bottom of the menu.   NOPE.  If there's one thing I can't stand it's a restaurant that posts \"no substitutions\" anywhere.  Combine that with the odd gaudy decor, looping video of the odd owner and odd sense of pretentiousness from the staff, I was baffled.\n\n*  Food Quantity \/ Quality \/ Presentation\n-  Ordinary\n\nMy entree was ordinary.  Really just ok.  The bread, however was OUTSTANDING.  It really shined with the olive oil.  Very good.  We were a party of seven and everyone's dish was just ok. \n\n*  What I'll remember\n\nThe gaudy decor, the odd sense of \"brainwash\" that seemed to captivate the pretentious staff, the endless looping video of the garish owner making pasta.  I'm chuckling as I write this.  So strange.\n\n*  What I can't wait to forget\n\nThe gaudy decor, the odd sense of \"brainwash\" that seemed to captivate the pretentious staff, the endless looping video of the garish owner making pasta.
