Everything is super cheap but it's all almost rotten. Containers of berries have a few moldy ones in it. The apples look like they were all dropped and bruised. The entire place smells like mold as soon as you walk in.. Especially the back room. I wouldn't be surprised if the employees get lung problems. I'm not sure anything in the store is safe to eat just because it's been around so much mold. I'm not even sure it is safe to step foot inside! I have now been twice and both times walked out with nothing. Not sure if it's supposed to be this way but I would avoid it at all costs.
