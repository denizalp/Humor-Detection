Lon's is the restaurant nestled in at The Hermosa in the beautiful scenic Paradise Valley part of Scottsdale. The Hermosa is a bouquet resort.\n\nMy review is based on only one lunch visit and I note I have a habit of checking out nice places for lunch before I decide to invest in dinner.\n\nWe entered and I was blown away with how nice and friendly the host and hostess were. It was a joy to get seated. The weather was just right for patio dining so we sat on the comfortable patio with mature trees and desert views.\n\nOur waiter is also kind and friendly introduces himself and takes our order when we are ready. During out stay he was very attentive and also offered many beverage refills.\n\nSoon I receive my plate of Fish and Chips. The fish is Halibut and is fresh tasting, moist and flaky just like it should be. My plate included a house made sauce and the tastiest freshest house made herbed fries I remember having in a while. This wasn't a fancy plate at all but everything on it was fresh and technically perfect.\n\nMy husband had the short rib pizza. He said the short rib was very good and the pizza was smeared with house made ricotta cheese that added great flavors. I stole a tomato from the pizza and it was so sweet with a fresh picked tomato taste. My husband said the pizza was really very good and very tasty. The only criticism that I can add is that the pizza runs on the small side for a man's appetite. \n\nWe also were made to feel very welcome by the manager who also offered to get us anything.\n\nTypical of all resorts the lunch pricing runs on the high side.\n\nYou might need to know that they are without self parking so you do use a valet.\n\nLon's accepts Preferred Scottsdale Dining Cards this year (Fall 2016- Summer2017) so if you have the card one meal will be deducted from your check.
