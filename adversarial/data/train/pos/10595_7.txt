This place is legit. No other way to put it. It's hard work and it's committment but there is a great support group there to help you push through. I'm into my second month, I take the morning class and I know it's the place for me because I already have such a love\/hate relationship with it. \n\nCrossfit might not be for everybody, but you won't know until you try. Gayle, Jen and Travis are fantastic at instruction and motivation and they certainly \"walk the walk.\" \n\nThrow away your gym membership and also some of your pride, because it is very challenging, I can't lie. But I dug my hole and Full Strength Crossfit is helping me to get out of it. I have now moved on to the point where the guilt of not getting up and going is greater than the pain (good pain) I feel when I complete a workout.\n\nAwesome workout space, expanding class schedule, brand new equipment...not much more to say. And honestly, not much more I can type because i am so exhausted from the 6am WOD \"Workout of the Day\" this morning. It wasn't pretty....but what were you doing at 6am this morning while I was kicking ass?\n\n(I said good for kids because they do have youth classes as well)
