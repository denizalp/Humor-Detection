There is a good reason why this church has the largest congregation in Calgary. The sermon's are outstanding because they are easy to understand, applicable to your life, and topical (ie. What is a Christian response to a difficult sibling?), not an analysis of a particular Bible passage (ie. What does John 3:16 mean?). The people are friendly, and it is easier to meet people at the satellite locations. The finances are transparent, so you know exactly where your donations are going.
