If you're not already familiar with the abnormal beauty company\/DECIEM  better get ready because there's already 5 more locations either already open, or soon to be opening up in Toronto. \n\nKnown for their unconventional and disruptive approach to beauty, Deciem is one of the few companies that FULLY produce all their own products (sold under multiple brand names, like NIOD, The Chemistry brand, etc) from start to finish, and it's all made right here in Toronto! \n\nTheir products are scientifically formulated, using cutting edge ingredients and for the most part are vegan and not tested on animals (*of note: DECIEM was recently acquired by Estee Lauder, who does test products on animals, however DECIEM have pledged to continue to not test on animals citing that their products will not be available for purchase in mainland China) \n\nThe Brand that everyone and their mother-in-law is making a big fuss about is \"The Ordinary\"!!!  The Ordinary offers an extensive line of skin care products and foundations that are extremely effective and ridiculously affordable, so it's worth knowing that a good deal of the products are either sold out or are currently in production for reorder, so be patient. \n\nEven Deciem's top of the line expensive and award winning line NIOD (who's products range from $35 to $200) is pretty fair considering that creams from pinnacle beauty Brands that are of similar efficacy like Cle de Peau and La Prairie can cost up to $1,000!!! \n\nSo far I have tried The Chemistry Brands hand cream (meh),  The Ordinary brand serum foundation, which has amazing liquid texture looks and feels like skin in a very light, but buildable coverage matte finish but leaves behind a bit of a powdery white cast, well for me it did anyway ¯\\_(ツ)_\/¯ and the Ordinary's  \"Buffet\" which is a jack-of-all-trades type of serum with hydrating and anti-aging properties, and this stuff really works!!! \n\nThe store itself is a gorgeous open-concept space in The Distillery District, I think this used to be a furniture store actually so there's a lot of space with very little product and as I mentioned earlier a lot of product will be sold out on reorder. \n\nAnother amazing thing about DECIEM is their extremely generous return policy of 365 days with the receipt, THAT, is insane! \n\nIf you're someone like myself, who's a beauty and skin care nerd, you will go ape shit level bananas for Deciem's products and especially for the multi formulated Ordinary brand, and all in all I would highly recommend Deciem to quell your beauty and skincare fixes.
