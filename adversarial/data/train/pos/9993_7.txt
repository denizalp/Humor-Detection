I went here to get my eyebrows shaped\nI have really short eyebrows and the last place i went made them horribley thin so I let them grow out entirely and then decided to try Orya instead\nLet me say a few things\n1) the staff seems really presonable and friendly, which is one star\n2) I was offered drinks or coffee and wasnt ignored, anotehr star\n3) christina really knows what shes doing, my eyebrows really did come out great\n4) the place is clean and they accept most forms of payment (not american express)\n\nwhy not 5 stars?\nbecause i paid 30 dollars to get my eyebrows done!\nI'm sorry, it was good, but thats a LOT of money\n\nif you're willing to dish the dough, it really is great\nIf you're a cheapshit like me? find somewhere else\n\nKUDOS TO CHRISTINA THO, MY EYEBROWS LOOK GREAT
