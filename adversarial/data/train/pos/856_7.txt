What a nice surprise!\n\nMy mom & I decided to try this place after an amazing day of hiking at Red Rock & we were starving. Looked to Yelp as I have many times and noticed this place and the great reviews it has.\n\nThe decor is very simple and everything is clean & in place, loved it! Anyone into Japanese rap? I am! Honestly I thought Eminem was rapping in Japanese for a minute and I loved it! They also have their own version of Nicki Minaj and now I want to go check out all these artists in Japan! Also, the bathroom was very modern and smelled really good! Nice!!!!!\n\nOk so now to what matters most, the food. Loved everything! Stand outs were the Red Tiger & Sushi Bomb rolls! They also carry super white and allow you to order half rolls! Management - thank you for making good decisions :) There's only one dish I wouldn't order again and that was the Korean BBQ. Smelled like heaven but was too chewy for my liking. The sushi was so good! Watching my mom eat literally everything including uni made my heart smile! Her chopstick skills were also on point! \n\nSo I'm happy to report a new sushi place that I will be a regular at just 5 mins from home, score! :) \n\nDon't skip on the dessert. The honey toast was out of this world.
