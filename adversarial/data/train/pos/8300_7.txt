Overpriced. You have to pay to park here even if you are a guest here. The floor wasn't so clean when I checked out my hotel room. I stepped on something squishy!! Also, they didn't provide many towels so when I asked for 2, they gave us 3! What? What happened to not wasting water and towels?\nThis hotel is in a decent location on the strip, but it doesn't have very great restaurants in the hotel itself. It's actually kind of small too compared to others, especially considering the price. The pool is pretty nice, although you'd burn if you didn't wear sunscreen since there is so little shade.\nOverall, this was a meh experience. I have always wanted to stay here, but now, I probably wouldn't willingly come back
