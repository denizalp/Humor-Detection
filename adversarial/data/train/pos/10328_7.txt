Not going to lie...this is a super great deal! I got to go to the buffet at Harrahs, Caesars, and Planet Hollywood. \nSo Harrahs was ok food wise but service was awesome. Our attendant was the nicest. Then later on that night came caesars, food was better than Harrahs, service was ok. Both Harrahs and Caesars do not have that big of a selection. Then on sunday headed off to planet hollywood. Ok so service here was like the complete opposite at Harrahs...but the food was the best out of the three here. A lot more selections! \nAll in all very much worth it, I had my fill of food and energy with it. Although I wish I had gone to the Bellagio again... Thats my fave. But if you are looking for a good deal and on a budget, definitely do this!
