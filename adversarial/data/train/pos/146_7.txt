This review is for the downstairs areas and casino only as we did not stay here, only gambled here and walked around. \n\nWe had tickets to see Penn and Teller Friday night and had heard from my mother that the seafood buffet at the Rio was good, so we decided to come here for dinner, show, gambling. The hotel itself was quite nice, but packed with families(which I always find odd for Vegas). There were these circus like contraptions floating up above our heads with people dancing inside of them and throwing down beads like at Mardi Gras w\/out boobies showing. The women were scantily clad and the men were topless (nice bodies I might add). It was a fun show to popular music and I am sure the powers that be get amused seeing people crawling on the floor for cheap ass beads...anyway.\n\nWe played table games here-a little Let it Ride and some 3\/5\/7. Neither of us had much luck, so when it was time to go to our show, we were happily able to leave the table. After the show, I decided to check out their poker room. I played for a couple of hours and left with the same amount of money I bought in for. There was a terribly intoxicated jerk across from me who got his panties all in an uproar because someone river-ed him against his pocket 8's. What a jerk. The casino host should have recognized his level of intoxication and escorted him out of the poker room, but I am sure the regulars (locals) were enjoying taking his money just a little too much.\n\nI would come back here again, but not any time soon.
