RED FLAG, RED FLAG, RED FLAG!  I wish I could give this place a quarter star! None of the food is restaurant quality! Frozen broccoli, re-heated potatoes that were cold in the middle and the \"Mystic Cheesesteak\" was rubbery and also re-heated somehow.  Maybe that's the mystic part. My girlfriend had the vegetarian kamut pasta, also sprinkled with frozen vegetables and BLAND as bland can be. Our choice of red or white wine was red and it came ice cold! The menu is bizarre and third gradish stemming from the owner who clearly does not give a crap and doesn't know what the hell he is doing. Hopefully by the time you read this they will be out of business and I will have saved you $$$. The server was nice and as sweet as could be but gives you the most bizarre excuses for everything.  Were it not for her and my girlfriend not wanting me to make a scene, we would have walked out.  Please trust me when I tell you that I do know what I am talking about and if you go with the five star reviews don't say I didn't try to tell you.
