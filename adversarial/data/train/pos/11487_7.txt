Train your people!\n\nI was specifically looking for some Prada sunglasses so I stopped in to browse.\n\nI came in twice on this visit since I was indecisive about a pair of sunglasses that I needed to have made into prescription sunglasses.  \n\nI tried on several pair and despite the same model only different color they were not fitting me the same.  \n\nOne pair would be much larger, etc.  The saleslady came over and we chatted a bit but she didn't seem to think it was awkward or that the sizing difference was caused by people trying them on. \n\nI came back again with my husband to show him the shades I had in mind and mentioned how weird it was that one fit bigger than the other.  So he was trying to look at numbers in the frames thinking maybe they had different sizes or something?  Then he said to me, \"This one says 54 (which is actually the size of the lense).\n\nAt that exact moment the saleslady who had assisted me previously was across the store helping another customer and heard what my husband said. She interrupts our conversation and yells out, \"No, they're 254 dollars not 54!\"  \n\nWe left and I bought my Prada's at ILORI located downstairs where I received superb professional service.
