My boyfriend and I have driven 45 mins, on many occasions, to shop at Asylum. At first, we loved this place. The selection was great; however, as we visited more and more frequently we noticed that the owner is a bit pretentious (as you can tell by his responses to his not-so-good reviews) and anal about his records. You can barely look through the selection without being reprimanded on how to handle a record. \"Don't do this! Don't do that!\" As a lover of vinyl-if I touch it\/listen to it, 99.9% of the time, it's leaving the store with me. I understand the importance of preserving records, but this guy is on another level. The signs on the front door with all the dos & donts are just a forewarning of what you'll encounter once you're inside.\n\nGet over yourself, dude. It's a record store.
