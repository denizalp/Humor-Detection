I have shopped online for Steel City's clothing brand and even bought a few shirts at other retailers that carry their clothes so I was beyond excited to see they finally have their own shop in downtown Pittsburgh.\n\nIt's been open since November and hopefully doing well. It's a small shop, but doesn't need to be huge because Steel City carries a small collection of Pittsburgh theme'd shirts, ranging from Pittsburgh Steelers themed to anything related to being a \"yinzer\". They have men's, women's, and children's shirts.\n\nThe shirts are $29 so they aren't the cheapest, but they're good quality and they come preshrunk, but I still recommend trying them on first, don't want your shirt to be too snug after eating one too many pierogis.\n\nThe girls working were super friendly and I wish I still lived here to constantly stop by and get shirts. For now, online will have to do, but any time I'm home, I'll make sure I stop by and see what they have in stock.
