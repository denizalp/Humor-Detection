Great upscale lounge Downtown that boasts a modern decor and feel. Located in walking distance from El Cortez parking garage in the heart of Downtown. We were pleasantly surprised by this venue that marked the start of our Project Dinner Table experience with a cocktail hour hosted here. We enjoyed handcrafted signature drinks and exquisite appetizers while mingling with other fellow foodies and playing corn hole along with other games like shuffle board, large Connect Four, extra large Jenga etc. Ample seating is everywhere that also features a large bed for lounging or taking silly pictures and cushy love sacs in the middle of the room. This place is like the dream adult version of your favorite after school hangout if you were a kid in the 80's. We would have never known of this ultra cool hangout if it weren't for Project Dinner Table. Downtown is all a buzz right now and this gem is a place you must try out when in the area.
