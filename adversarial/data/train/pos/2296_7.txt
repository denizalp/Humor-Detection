Don't take children here.  Probably due to the name, this place is a magnet for swag losers and all around D-bags.  This place was full of scumbags and all you can hear constantly is the F-word and sheeeeyyitt.  I ever heard the phrase \"fo' real\" being used repeatedly.  That's like wearing a Rush t-shirt to a Rush concert...you just don't do it.  Seriously though I've never been legitimately turned off to a restaurant because of its customer base.  The 1 star rating was hardly even due to the above though...\n\nThe food might have been okay on a different day, but it took forever to get our meal, and then the pho was luke warm.  It was so cold that the beansprouts didn't soften and none of the flavors from the other ingredients infused.  The waitress didn't give us the opportunity to ask that they microwave our soup.  Which brings me to the service...\n\nOne girl took our order, a guy brought our food, and a different girl brought the check.  When they came to the table, they were so hurried, you couldn't say anything to them.  We never got refills.  \n\nForget this place.  Go anywhere else.  They had one job, and that was to bring us hot pho, and they couldn't.
