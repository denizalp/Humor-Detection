Black Friday sales event scam. We got a nice postcard, with a winning number. We called the store to ensure that there is actually a prize and not just a scam. We were told to come to the store to claim the prize. \n\nOnce we got into the store, a salesman greeted us. He stated that in order to claim the prize, we have to first fill out a form. He confirmed that there is a prize. We filled out the form, he took it inside, and came out with yet, another form. He said they are out of the prizes ($10 gift card), and the only thing left was a free vacation package. But we have to fill out another form. We left.
