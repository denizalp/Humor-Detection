If you love chicken fingers I kid you not if you are ever in Vegas and you are a hater of Chick fil-a people because they use peanut oil, then this is your dream come true. Due to cross contamination with shellfish and peanuts there are many places I can't eat that fry food. The Rebel kids swore I would love this place and they did not use peanut oil. They were so freakin right I love this place, I need to call their HQ and ask them to come to the Bay.
