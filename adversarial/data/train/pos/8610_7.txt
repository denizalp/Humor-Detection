When I take time to think about it, I think the desert is a natural environment for scorpions and smoothies. Unfortunately in Las Vegas, finding scorpions is much easier. I would trade in a couple of froyo places for a tasty smoothie joint.\n\nI'll admit: I like Jamba Juice. And, there is a Smoothie King in Centennial Hills, but it is not worth the drive despite the fact that I love the King. Tropical Smoothie is about as dependable as an iPhone connection (from what I hear about the iPhone). So, that is the world of smoothies from my perspective. I like for people to know what they're working with.\n\nI stopped by Inta Juice after my teriyaki dinner at Yogis. It is a standard smoothie place interior without the enhanced \"caf√©\" component of Tropical. I did not feel acknowledged by the staff. (I think I have been spoiled by the boisterous greetings at Japanese restaurants.)\n\nStill, I stuck around to order. The selection is large and includes a selection of straight up juices, which is a positive. You get free two boosts, which is a big positive. I love feeling super healthy by selecting the perfect boost. I realize it is more of a feeling than a reality, but placebos work, darn it! I started looking at the new age reading materials and forgot to pay attention to if they were actually putting fruit into my smoothie. Crystals and numerology are very distracting, but I did notice they have a machines dispensing juice. I am not sure if the juice in the dispenser is squeezed on site. I did not ask, but I did become concerned that perhaps the smoothie would be sugary because of the juice factor. \n\nThe smoothie was definitely sweet, but also tart, and tart smoothies make me smile. I'd give Inta another try, but this time I would actually pay attention to what was going inta the blender!
