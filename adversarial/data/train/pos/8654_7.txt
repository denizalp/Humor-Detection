A phone call from an out of town buddy summoned me to Cantina Laredo tonight for a dinner. We arrived at 7pm and were seated at the bar. Our waitress was very friendly and got us waters and menus, then quickly back to take drink orders.\nAn order of their table made guacamole was done along with a Pineapple infused margarita for me. \nThis is where is started slipping away. Happy hour was only 5 minutes over, yet no offer to sneak in the cocktail. $11.95 for the margarita could have been 1\/2 off. We did mention we were first timers here. That kind of rubs me the wrong way. The chips and salsa brought to our table were ok, but half the bowl was full of chip crumbles. Nothing to put the $9.95 guacamole on....she did eventually bring more chips about the same time as our main orders arrived.\nI had tacos barbacoa...which was ok, meat was tender, a little kick in the chipotle sauce. Nothing to write home about....beans and rice on the side. $13.95 I think was the price. My friend had the carnitas that were supposed to have the bone but we were informed all out of bone in pork, so just regular pork. He said it was ok.\n\nWould I go back here? Probably not for the food, but I would for Happy Hour and half off margaritas as it was pretty tasty.
