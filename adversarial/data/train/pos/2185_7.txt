Stopped in for a quick takeout lunch today and was very impressed. The menu offers, typical Chinese options, plus sushi, curry and some Thai! The lunch specials are very affordable for the portion!\n\nI went with beef broccoli, which came with choice of soup and rice...all for $6! The container was even high class and not your typical Chinese containers. I also got the veggie egg roll app for $3 which came with two rolls. I'll be a regular in no time!
