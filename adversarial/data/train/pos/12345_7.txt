It was alright. I went in with high hopes and was a bit disappointed. The bar area is a gaming area with a couple of small booths. They do serve food in there, but it's small and icky. So I opted to be seated instead. The dining room is nice. Not romantic or anything. Like a step up from the Olive Garden. There were a lot of families with kids there. The view of the Strip is quite nice. (Tip: Ask to be seated by the window so you can enjoy the view.) The service was great. Very attentive and friendly. Perhaps I just ordered the wrong items? I started with the oysters. They were served on ice with a lemon (with no sleeve \/ catching thing) and just cocktail sauce with horseradish (no vinaigrette). They were ok, but didn't taste all that fresh. I then had the linguine with clams in red sauce. It was served with the clams in the shells (which I love), but they were all mixed in with the pasta, making getting the clams out a challenge (all the linguine was tangled in the shells). When I have had this dish before, the clams are usually on top around the sides and not mixed in. The sauce was not \"zesty\" as described and was quite watery. Not a particularly good food experience. But the by-the-glass and by-the-half-bottle wine list was decent. And the service and view were great. Perhaps I'll try it again and order something different. But my initial impression was it's something just a step or so up from a chain place. There are definitely far better Italian places around town.
