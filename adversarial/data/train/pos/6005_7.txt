Fanboy alert: \n\n I can't stand the usual ta-do in Vegas. I hate gambling, not much of a drinker and I have to go here every year for work. So when I turned my receipts in to the business office they laughed at me. If I'm in Vegas, I'm at one of 4 places; here, Gameworks, New York, New York upstairs arcade and I finish off at the Paris with a Hennessey XO. This place is simply pinball nirvana. This is wonderful place for the 35+ nostalgic crowd. If you are in this group, break away one night from your party, the standard blackjack and nickel slots and head over to the Pinball Hall of Fame. \n+1 for Bride of Pinbot
