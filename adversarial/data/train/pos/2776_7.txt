Seriously? This place hella sucks. Customer service is just bad!\n\nSooo I went through the drive through and the lady on the speaker too her sweet time asking what I would like. I asked about a few things and decided on a mixed 10 piece bucket thing. She stated I could get 2 boneless breasts then a mixture of anything else. I did just that, I wanted 2 BB and the rest legs. OF COURSE they were a few short of what I wanted so she offered more breasts to which I accepted. She gave me my total, which was not the same as she had quoted earlier and I proceeded to the window. A different lady then gave me ANTOHER more expensive total and I asked why? \"Because you added more breasts\" I rebutted that the order taker offered since they were out and the cashier shook her head and reassured me I would need to pay the upcharge.\n\nDon't offer something because you ran out of an item then expect the customer to pay. And 3 different totals is no bueno!\n\nI asked for my card back and left. Customer service is horrid and the employees seem like they hate their jobs. \n\nNo Yay! for you!
