Hop Farm was our 3rd stop on Friday's Lawrenceville bachelorette celebration. It was my first time and I was very excited to try it out! The layout is decent - picnic tables with plenty of seating. The bartender was...what's a word that rhymes with itch? However, the server who visited our table was a delight. All in all, I won't make a special trip, but I'd visit again for the Kulak (stout w\/honey) if I ended up in the neighborhood. Try it for yourself!
