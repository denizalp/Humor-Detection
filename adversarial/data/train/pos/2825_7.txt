This place is a real dive-y dive. It's dim, has a small patio, interesting clientele (lol Browns fans), and yeah, it smells funny. Not that I could dwell on it for long when I was pouring white chocolate ale down the hatch. 'Twas heavenly! The selection of alcohol is actually pretty sparse, but the bartender knew what she was doing, so it's a-ok.\n\nAnd then after you're hammered, there's the gay Denny's across the street. Best people watching ever.
