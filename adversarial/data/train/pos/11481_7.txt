I'm visiting from California and after a long 6 hour drive, I stopped in for a drink. \nService: I felt rushed to give my order, I asked for a few mins to look over menu. The server came back immediately I didn't get a chance to completely look over menu. So I asked if they had fried pickle and was told this is Not \"BWW\". So I order chips and salsa. \nFood: chips and salsa were terrible. The chips were greasy and rubbery. Stall tasting. I jus wanted to finish my beer and leave.\n\nIt took so long to get my bill , the server never checked on me. I could have jus walked out.
