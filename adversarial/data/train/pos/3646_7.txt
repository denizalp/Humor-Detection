Tammy is the best for pedicures! Tina is the best for acrylic and gels! \n\nI've been coming to Tammy for months. Tammy uses scrubs, lotions, oils, and hot rocks while massaging my feet and legs. She does my cuticles and scrubs my feet. She is awesome. They offer three package prices for pedicures, and I usually get the $28.00 package.
