45 $ for a crappy backpack is pricey in my humblest opinion...not that the Gap is any better. Yes,  the staff is very friendly and courteous, the store is neatly organized and so forth but the clothes and bags are overpriced\n\nAnd for those who love the Quebec style (not exactly similar to European, unless you have never been to Europe) all they have to do is wear the same pair of jeans and  the same jacket for 4 months without any washing...add a scarf, plastic over-sized sunglases  and voil√†...that`s the Quebec, or so-called European look....so chic....
