My boyfriend decided the day before NYE that we would go to Vegas instead of Disneyland and luckily we managed to find a more upscale suite last minute. \n\nPros\n\nService: Cosmopolitan, Caesars, and the Venetian was already booked out for NYE, Eric that helped us on 12-30-15 came through with an open suite and made sure our check in was a breeze. Also was impressed how the front desk handled a conflict I had booked from a third party. The overall service from the front desk was professional and kind throughout the entire stay. \n\nShopping: Love the fact it's connected to their sister hotel, The Venetian so there was plenty of options especially for high end designers. You can walk through the shopping canal to browse a variety of different stores or eat at one of their high end chef restaurants or get a quick bite at their food court.\n\nLocation\/Parking: You're located on the strip, but you're not in the middle of strip where it might be congested with cars, but close enough where you can enjoy all the amenities and the glam of walking on the strip. Parking is free and the parking lot is easily accessible by the freeway. Plenty of parking spaces at the Palazzo, but if it does get packed, then you can go to the Venetian parking lot which is adjacent to the hotel. \n\nAmenities: Free Wifi (although a bit slow - you can pay for an increase in the download speed), coupon for $25 off one of their restaurants, $15 slot machine or table play credit, and free coffee\/tea at one of their store. \n\nRooms: Every room is a suite so you pay for what you get! The rooms are really spacious with a sectional couch and plenty of chairs. You also get a tv in every room (bathroom, bedroom, and their living room). It is exactly what you expect when you book a high end suite. Pay a little extra and you'll get more in return!\n\nCons\n\nCleanliness: wasn't too impressed with the overall cleanliness of the hotel. The tables still had food stains from the previous stay and some of the furniture in the living room had a thick layer of dust. \n\nVentilation\/Casinos: It feels like you're downloading lung cancer when you walk through their casino. Hopefully they improve their ventilation in the casinos to avoid having to wear a gas mask when trying to reach your room.
