First off, I just wanted to say that anyone who knows me knows that I love love love curry! Japanese and Thai Curry to be precise! Growing up, my mom's home made curry was always the best. I mean, who doesn't love 'mom's' cooking, right? \nAs unfortunate as it was, I moved to Vegas and the months grew to years; my taste bud fell short, unsatisfied by the curry palettes offered in Vegas. Almost everything was a hit or miss! It was either the curry sucked and the meat was perfect, or the other way around. Booo!\n\nAny ways, long story short, I found this place off of yelp and it was a romantic story between my dish and I. Love at first sight. I couldn't keep myself away! Is it bad that I COULD EAT IT EVERYDAY!? NO PUN INTENDED. LOL. \nMeat ever so tender, various side options to satisfy the texture cravings, and curry spices to what ever heat you wish! Simply amazing. \nAside from the food being tastey, service is and always has been delightful. \n\nThe End.
