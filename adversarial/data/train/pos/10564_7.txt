The price is right for these street tacos, rolled tacos, tamales and Mexican hot dogs at newly-opened Tacos Atoyac. Sure, while taco shops are a dime a dozen in Phoenix, the price point and taste can't be beat. The decor is very casual and spartan for now, but the value for a typical family meal make Tacos Atoyac a steal.\n\nThe lengua, cabeza and carne asada tacos were flavorful and at $1 each, quite the value.  The black beans came to our table topped with cotija cheese and the arroz was reminiscent of any you'd find at any abuelita's house.  \n\nThe \"Oaxacan-style\" hot dog was colorful and topped with generous helpings of sliced tomatoes, bacon bits and avocado and so very delicious.\n\nHorchata and Mexican Coca Cola are plentiful, and the Coke priced at $1.50 is the cheapest I've seen yet at a taco shop.\n\nOverall dinner for two was about $13, which included six tacos, one soda a spicy chicken tamale, a rolled taco and a Oaxacan hot dog. Not bad...\n\nIt's easy to find at the NE corner of Glendale Ave. and 19th Ave., next to 7-11. Can't wait to visit again, and am looking forward to having another lengua taco, hot dog and to trying the tortas!
