I got a car wash Wednesday at noon and it rained at 6pm that same evening.  Next day I took my car in for a raincheck and they refused to let run it through for a $3 car wash.  They don't realize that I will now drive out of my way to find better customer service!  They just lost 3 cars from my household.
