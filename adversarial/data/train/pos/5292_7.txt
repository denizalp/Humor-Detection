We came to this Store for nitrogen ice cream. There was one customer ahead of us. She ordered coffee, yet continued to talk with the cashier about vertigo and MRIs. They talked for over 5 minutes without acknowledging us.  After being ignored and waiting right behind the lady, we decided to leave.\n\nWe will not be back to this store.  There is a much better dessert ice cream and drink place just down the street.
