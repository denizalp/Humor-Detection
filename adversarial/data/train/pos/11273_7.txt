Everytime I'm in Vegas I tend to stay at The Signature.  The rooms are just so fresh and so clean (like that Outkast song).  It comes at an affordable rate a night and the room I was staying at had a huge king size bed with a couch with another bed pulled out.  The restrooms are absolutely gorgeous, with an incredible bath tub and an amazing sink.  They have a huge balcony where you can catch a view of the entire city both marvelous day and night.\n\nThe service is remarkable.  Everytime I leave the hotel and come back even if its like for a couple of minutes I swear it ends up being neatly cleaned when I return.  Now thats some awesome cleaning people.  They provide bath robes too which I found out later you can just walk out on the streets in...I should have done that.  \n\nThe valet parking is free.  You can pick up your whip anytime (as we usually drive to Vegas).  They have a great gift shop, an awesome buffet and a nice Casino which I originally won some money then lost a lot more lol.  During my time, I traveled across to other hotels and everytime I return back to the Signature I'm reminded of how much better it is in appeal compared to the others especially for the price.  To be honest, I just wanted to stay at the hotel the whole time I was there and just relax.  \n\nAlso a huge plus for me is the huge elevators they have.  It really helped out my claustrophobia.  Good stuff...I shall return again.
