Hands down, my FAVORITE buffet place in Vegas!\n\nUnlimited steamed crab legs, yes please!\n\nInstead of listing every single item I ate, just know their buffet will exceed your expectations of a \"normal\" buffet, after all, it is Vegas!\n\nI recommend going early like 5pm, if you want Bacchanal for dinner because anytime after that, it will be a wait. Not the \"let me get a slurpee from 7\/11\" wait, it's the \"let me buy random junk I don't need on black Friday\" wait.
