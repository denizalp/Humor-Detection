This was by far the worst massage experience I have EVER had. I came in for relaxation and left sore and stressed! I will start with a couple positives:\n\n1) Both times I spoke with the front desk staff they were very nice and helpful. \n2) I like the quiet room and they have very comfortable tables with nice sheets. \n\nUnfortunately it ends there. I specifically came in for relaxation which was marked on my sheet under \"type of massage\" as well as \"why did you come in\". As soon as the \"massage\" started I was in pain. There was no lotion being used and my skin was being pinched and pulled very hard. She also used karate chops and was just really rough. Throughout the massage no  massage strokes were used, I have never had a massage (if you can even call it that) like that in my life. \n\nShe also kept knocking me in the head with her arms and saying sorry. The massage continued with poking, pinching and pulling. I just kept thinking I couldnt wait for it to be over. Definately NO relaxation here! While checking out the receptionist asked how my massage was. I told her that it was painful and not relaxing. She offered me a $10 discount and said \"some people like her technique\". She also offered me a couple different names for when I rebook. unfortunately that won't happen.
