When I went looking for apartments, the employees were very helpful and accomodating to my apartment preferences. Most of the apartments are in okay shape, however, the cheaper ones look like they haven't been updated since the 80's. Overall, I think they are a good bet and the monthly parking fees are pretty reasonable.
