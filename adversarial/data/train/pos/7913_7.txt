I called in my order for pickup because they stop accepting online orders an hour before closing. The guy that took my order was polite and helped me out with my questions. They have a great selection of white pizzas. I tried the pomodoro and added mushrooms.  Normally I only eat thin crust pizza, but I decided to try the regular after seeing the yelp photos.  I was glad I did. It was quite tasty. The toppings were generous and I was overall very pleased.  The next time I order I will request the crust to be cooked a little longer than normal (they show you that option with online ordering) because I like a very crispy crust.
