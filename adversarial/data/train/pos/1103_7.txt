I've always heard great reviews about this place. i tried Hash House A Go Go in San Diego and wasn't impressed. Since I was staying at the Rio and was too lazy to leave.. I decided to give this place a second chance. Boy was I wrong to come back again.\n\nI don't even remember the name of the plate I ordered but I wish I hadn't ordered it. My dish was suppose to be some type of omlette with avocados, onions and cheese. I actually thought the avocados would be on the side but it was actually cooked in the omlette with the cheese. Honestly the plate came out on the sour side and it wasn't eatable at all. Super unhappy with what I ordered and from what I recall from my San Diego visit...it was super plain as well. NOT impressed this second time around and don't think I will be going to any more Hash House A Go Gos going forward. The food here is really mediocre and SUPERRR overhyped. I still don't see what the hype is about. THE FOOD IS SUPER BLAND. I suggest spending your money on the strip where the foods 10x better or going off strip for local foods.\n\nYelp Review 2017 Challenge 45\/100
