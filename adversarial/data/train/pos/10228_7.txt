Stopped in after breakfast to pick up some Hawaiian goodies. The poke selection looked tempting, and so did the poi, but we just decided to get non-perishable things since we had other stops to make.\n\nAlways a fun time in this store, not only to check out the wierd and bizzare food items ilke haggis, duck balut and an English pudding called Spotted Dick,\nthey also carry a wide assortment of home accents, cookware, kitchen gadgets, and a MASSAGING HULA HOOP!?!?!?!?!(Boy does that look like it would hurt BIG TIME!-See Photo)\n\nAndrew Zimmern would feel right at home here.....ALOHA!!!
