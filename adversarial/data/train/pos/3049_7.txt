I live 5 mins from dix30, so for the South shore this area provides many outdoor options for the summer! For a Sunday I didn't have many options available for 4 pm, most rooftops were only open from 5 pm onwards. So I chose Casey's - I've been here numerous times before for their fun cocktails!\n\nOn this particular day, it was super hot so I vetted for an outdoor patio seat with the sun baking me in 32C. The menu changed - they didn't have the artichoke dip I usually go for. I ordered a pint of shock top with a Caesar salad. The beer came quickly as did the salad. The presentation of the salad could have been better, looked like I made it at home. Then why would I bother eating out? Not appeasing. Flavour was good. Although, I noticed some old pieces of lettuce - the chefs clearly do not look through their greens. Ugh. \n\nHowever, I'm not picky for 25$ it was a good meal experience. I may go for other options next time.
