This small room can be fun because of the energy spilling in from the hoppin Palms main floor, especially late at night.  You're right there next to the Lounge bar and there's always a lot to see.\n\nI would not play limit poker here.  There are two No Limit games, and the 1\/3 is more exciting and varied, the one to play.  The 2\/5 is a tight locals game to be avoided.\n\nI was playing here Thursday in the 1\/3 NL and hit my first royal flush ever.  I flopped it with both my hole cards playing so I took down the $600 high hand jackpot as well as the pot (yes they have jackpots for quads, straight flush hands, etc here, a nice bonus).  One of the locals nearly had an epileptic seizure of jealousy.  Sorry Charlie!
