This is a place to grab some causal food when u are extremely busy gambling, meaning, u can't take this place serious! \n\nHong Kong cafe's service doesn't meet the hotel standard.  Their services are more like one of those cafe on spring mountains & jones area.\n\nThe food is ok.\n\nWell, here's the highlight of my visit:\n\nI ordered a classic HK cafe drink, which was iced lemon tea, it supposed to be served with sliced lemon with some super strong black tea, this lemon tea came with wedge lemon, and the tea tasted like \"milk tea\"! So we confronted the server, she said the tea probably sat too long that's why it tasted weird... Oh wow!! Thanks for telling me that! Yuck! My friend said the milk tea flavor might be the residue from the glass.  The server didn't correct my friend, instead she agreed with her! Omg  I was horrified.\n\nEnough said.
