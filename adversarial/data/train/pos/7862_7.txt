Hardly the best show on the strip.  I was expecting to be titilated  but was mostly bored.  The two girls in the glass was the highlight but it was at the beginning.  The show explores all forms of sexuality with every type and made fun of \"boring\" hetero 1guy, 1girl sex.  At the end there was this polite applause.  Discussion with folks around us as we left were disappointed as well. In spite of what others have said in the reviews, THERE IS NO NUDITY.  Girls are topless but zero private areas are shown which would be my definition of NUDITY, that is no clothing.\n\nOn the other end of the spectrum was Beatles Love which shouldn't be missed.
