So disappointed- i really wanted to like you. Actually, i wanted to fall in love with you.\nInstead.. you get a palm to the face. \n\nLike, for real Mandalay. You are so far from the strip so you better be a super great experience.  But you...are...not.\n\nI stayed there last week & wished I stayed anywhere else. Seriously.\n\nCheck it.\nI stayed 3 nights.\n\nNight 1) Sheet came off the bed. Really??? Why are your sheets so small. We didn't even do anything but sleep and they just came off.\n\nMorning 1) Hubby woke up with 2 bug bites..I just shrugged it off. Maybe he got bit \"outside\". Even though we didnt even leave the hotel. Whatever Mandalay.\n\nNight 2) At 3 am the pipes in the bathroom errupt and sound like a whale is trying to escape the Pacific. What the heck. \n\nMorning 2) Hubby woke up with 3 DIFFERENT bites. This is weird. But he's still excited about his conference so he doesn't mind. I put some cream on it and give it a finger-to-bruise-kiss.\n\nNight 3) Water comes on from the shower and guess what color it is... just guess.. PURPLE. yes. Sounds like a movie right?? wrong. its this stupid place. So after like 5 seconds its goes away and yes you guessed it, the creepy whale returned early in the morning. \n\nMorning 3 (check out day)- i wake up with 2 bites - one on my leg, and one on my back. Oh heck no. So glad this is over.\n\nthe bites itch bad & now I am feeling really bad for my husband because i didnt take him seriously. I call the front desk and here is a break down of what happened. \n\nMe: We have a problem.\nLady 1: Whats going on?\nMe: Bites, Whales, Blah\nLady 1: I'm sorry that happened. We will check the rooms for pests. Let me take your number so my manager can call you back.\nMe: Okay fine.\n\n\n3 days later nobody calls...\n\nI call back on day 4 to see a status update after no one called me. Lady 2 claimed they left a message on day 3......no they didnt & sshe claimed the room didnt have bugs.. yes they did.\n\nI live in California. No fake beach is that impressive that I will return to deal with this horrible place. \n\nBOO.
