I decided to come here after reading the reviews on yelp.  I was not disappointed.  The techs here are knowledgeable and very helpful.   If you're looking for great customer service and don't want to feel like you've been ripped off. This is your place. Dropped my Mac off on a Friday, they told me it may take around a week to get it back. Monday morning I got a call saying it was ready.  When I thought I was still experiencing problems,  they helped me fix it over the phone. Will definitely come here again for any future computer issues.
