Omg Vic and his dogs are awesome sauce and then some! My boyfriend has been raving about the Chili Man and his stand for months now. I was finally able to have him come down during his lunch break for some of these amazing hot dogs. \n\nThe Chili Man hot dog stand is parked right in front of Chima's steakhouse Tuesday-Friday from 11a-2p. There will be a line, but don't let it deter you. Not only are the dogs delicious but Vic is friendly and funny. Despite the fact that you'll be waddling away after chowin down and may need a food coma nap afterwards, the Chili Man experience is worth it. JUST DO IT, as I will tell you in the next paragraph, even vegans don't have an excuse. \n\nWhat really had me sold was Vic now has vegetarian friendly tofu dogs! Seriously most thoughtful hot dog vendor EVER! I walked over with my bf just expecting him to fulfill his craving, I wasn't going to get anything since the last uploaded menu on yelp only consisted of red meat hot dogs. But to my surprise I was able to have one too, I was so happy! AND the Chili Man even offers VEGAN Chili Wednesdays complete with vegan hot dogs and TVP chili. So rad. \n\nOk I'll stop raving now.. Lol so my boyfriend had the life changer and I had a vegetarian friendly life changer with a tofu dog and minus the chili. We didn't talk to each other while eating, hell, I don't even think we took a breath. That's how good the Chili Man dogs are. All in all, the Chili Man is THE man and his dogs are righteous. Goes without saying he will be seeing me every week..which brings me to my next quest...I need to find a good gym. \n\nCheers!
