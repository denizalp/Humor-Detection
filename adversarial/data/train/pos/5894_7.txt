What a beautiful restauraunt, so visually appealing. There are tables and chairs with umbrellas overtop outside to enjoy your crepe or pastry. We arrived quite late, which is one of the selling points of this establishment, and beheld an array of French delights. My other half bought an orange blossom pinwheel while I bought a peanut butter raspberry roll. Flaky, dense, and full of flavor, I hoarded the roll to myself even though it could be a large snack for two. My boyfriend enjoyed his pinwheel as he loves orange and his too was perfectly flaky. We were low on cash as we didn't bring enough with us as we thought we would need so these two pastries proved perfect for a couple desperate for culture and calories. We will surely be coming back.
