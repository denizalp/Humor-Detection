I have never been to a Sonic, EVER, until last week. It has been on my list of places I'd like to try, and I did not know Cleveland had a sonic until a couple weeks ago, and right then and there, I just knew I had to go.\n\nYou cannot go inside to eat, you actually drive your car up to a post where you can order and someone will bring out the food to you. Now I was excited for the part where the girls come out with roller skates, but that didn't happen and I was slightly disappointed as that has been all I've seen in Sonic commercials over the years. Whatever, I got over that. Food came out within five minutes of ordering, the girl was friendly too. \n\nThe food itself: I only got the burger to try, and it was just OK, nothing spectacular or mind blowing. It was very thin (I did not mind) but it left something to be desired with each bite. I was not impressed. Next time I will try their milkshakes, since that's what they seem to be more popular for.
