I rarely write reviews and when i do...it's either i really really love you...or really really dislike you!!!\n\nFood: it was not bad...when they brought out my fiance's calamari, i thought it was chicken wings at first coz it was shaped odd (like a surfboard, instead of the strips\/rings that im used to)...for $9, i expected a bigger portion. Good flavors, otherwise.\n\nThe korean bbq sandwich gets a thumbs up for me. \n\n$5 for a teeny kobe beef slider...really?\n\nMy fiance got one of their burgers (the Eastwood) and was not impressed. For the price we're paying, we're better off at Bachi burger. My fiance was not thrilled with the \"meh\" burger so he was just nibbling at it. (since he did pay $13 for such a mediocre entree)\n\nI ordered a side of sweet potato fries. Our server\/bartender Missy gave me regular fries instead and i pointed that out to her and she said she'll bring me the correct one....and i've never seen those fries for the rest of the night\n\nThis was our first stop of the night and it was cold outside and a bit chilly inside...so the kicker of it all was when Missy knocked a full glass of Dr. Pepper on my fiance's lap. Imagine, in the dead of winter, having an icy beverage spilled all over your jeans and you have plans to go later!!!! The busser was kind enough to mop the floors and apologize profusely.\n\nSo nearing the end of our meal, my fiance was the only left slowly munching on his mediocre burger. He was distracted talking to our big group of friends so tell me why Missy takes his burger and fries away without asking him!!! When she came back, he told her he wasnt done and she said \"i saw napkins on top of it and thought you were done\". Liar! There wasnt any napkins of top of his burger. I saw her put a dirty napkin on top of it and took it away!\n\nShe apologized and offered to grab him another burger or take it off the tab.\n\nMy fiance works in the restaurant biz so instead of Missy telling the manager the issues we've been having at our table, we had to flag the manager down to complain! Why wasnt this automatic, Missy?? You should let your manager know when there are issues IMMEDIATELY because the you want to please your paying customers!!!!\n\nSo when my fiance explained to the manager what happened, tell me why this manager says, \"What would you like me to do about it?\"\n\nAs a manager, you should first, apologize then say something like \"let me take that off your bill\". Why would you ask the customer what you want them to do? Dont you think it's embarrassing if the customer tells you...\"oh, you take that off my bill\".....The right thing to do is tell the customer that u'll take it off immediately, especially considering all the cr*p that happened to us. (my fiance told me this is what their managers do for their customers to keep them happy & for them to come back at his restaurant. )\n\nThe crowd: Tell me why our friends were the most diverse ppl in that whole restaurant??...i think majority of the crowd that was there saturday night were bikers and dudes wearing swastika, neo nazi shirts.....not cool if you have a crew with black, asian and hispanic ppl....but then again, we probably just went on a cr*ptastic night.\n\nFor a better variety of beers and fantastic food at reasonable prices (esp during their happy hour)...ur better off at Yard House!\n\nOk...enough of my PMS...\n\ntime for a donut.\n\noink
