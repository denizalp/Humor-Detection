The Nugget has a lot of problems. A lot of the staff seem jaded and rude(which is not unusual in Vegas). There is a 50\/50 split on dealers. Some of the pit are very charismatic and friendly, but some hate their jobs and the customers. \n\nPros=\n\nPoker Room-The dealers at the poker room are the finest dealers in the casino. Very friendly, knowledgeable, and helpful. \n\nThe Valet- It's free. They treat you like you are at the Ritz. They call you sir, they work hard, and speak in that sophisticated tone that you would expect from a full service hotel.  They are also very knowledgeable of the whole valley area. If you need directions to Red Rock Canyon or the Boulder Strip, they will know the shortest route. I always leave them a giant tip. \n\nCons= Casino Host. Casino Marketing. Floor Supervisors. Management in General. These cheapo managers don't comp players unless they are staying at the hotel. That means if you are just a local who wants to come here and play, you get Nothing! You can bet $25 a hand for 16 hours and you get NOTHING! You can bet $100 a hand for 16 hours and you still get NOTHING! You get nothing unless you are a guest in the hotel! \n\nRemember at the end of the movie \"Casino\", Sam Rothstein talks about how the corporations hired a bunch of idiots who ruined Las Vegas? Well, the casino marketing department here is obviously who he was talking about.
