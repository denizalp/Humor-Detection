Inside the Mandalay Bay. If you're looking for a hangover cure.. this isn't it.\n\nWonton noodle soup- 2\/5. I suppose this may be relatively good here? Noodles are hard and soup is generic and MSG tasting.\n\nThousand year old egg porridge- 2\/5. Bland once again with small portion of thousand year old egg and a measly small sprinkle of green onions.\n\nMongolian Beef- 1\/5. More like elementary school 'mystery meat mondays' for $20.\n\nLettuce mince meat wrap- 3\/5. Okay tasting but small portions, more like a small appetizer. \n\nHigh priced, but then again you are in Vegas so that's to be expected. But the quality is not good. It's much more worth it to drag yourself to a Pho place off the strip to cure that hangover.
