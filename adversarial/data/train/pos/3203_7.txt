This is such a sarcastic name... because you won't find any Quality what's so ever.\n\nWe happened to visit on their grand opening day after finish eating from Sushi restaurant next door. \n\nI ordered classic milk tea quoter sugar with tapioca and my boyfriend ordered Fresh Green tea with Cheese.... I believe it was part of grand opening deal otherwise he wouldn't order such Tea with cheese beverage lol \n\nMy Milk tea was overly sweet although I asked for quoter sugar and tapioca was disgusting. It was saggy and not chewy at all. \n\nAnd Fresh green tea with \"handmade\" cheese... those cheese cream smelled funny and tasted unique. It was tangy and stays on tongue. It didn't go well with tea and also our stomach.\n\nI am not able to identify if our unpleasant washroom experience is coming from those \"Handmade cheese\" or sushi from next door. Needless to say, We couldn't finish both drinks. \n\nNOT RECOMMENDED.
