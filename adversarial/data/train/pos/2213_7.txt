Ladies Free and Guys $45 on guestlist?? Something like that..I can't recall all the details really. This club experience is pretty awesome. Beautifully decorated. You take an elevator uuuup and it's PARTY TIME!\n\nI like the room that plays hip hop, but it gets crowded quick. Main floor is ok if you like house\/trance\/techno (I don't know the difference). Pretty spacious dancing area indoors. However, my friends and I ended up hanging out outside. We made our own dance floor!\n\nPool has mermaids swimming in them. It was like they were inviting me in to cool off from the Las Vegas dry windy heat! (It was in the high 80s that night). Only bummer is that we can't go into the pool. Not even to dip our hurting, blistering, high heel wearing feet!! WTH!?!? \n\nYou can play some games since they have tables outside. I don't gamble, so I can't share on any specifics. \n\nDrinks are expensive so PRE PARTY! The ONLY gripe I have about this club is the fact that you have to WALK down ugly stairs (think fire escape route) to get outta there! BAD planning on their part. Took my money and left me to cry walking down the stairs. :( No bueno Marquee! It's like a horrible one night stand....They lure you with their sexy look, get you drunk, dance you up, then toss you out the back door! \n\nNevertheless, I would definitely come back!
