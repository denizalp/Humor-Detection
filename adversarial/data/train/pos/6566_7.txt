I just ate the Gyro sandwich combo and let me say it was disgusting! What an insult to REAL gyros! I had no other option but to eat it so I didn't starve but do NOT get this dish!! The gyro wasn't authentic at all! Instead of the lamb being shaved (which is the correct way) they must have cooked it on a grill and cut it up. NEVER DO THAT!!! Then the cucumber sauce to go with it was the worst I have ever had! First it had this weird color to it then they added weird spices so it didn't taste right. The only thing they got right about the sauce was that it had some cucumbers in it. Unfortunately my coworkers had chosen this place to pick up food from and because of this horrible dish I will never order anything from here again!! Sadly I had to spend $8.99 for this disgusting food, too!! \n\nDO NOT GO HERE!!!! \n\nAlso, one of my coworkers ordered the Baja Burrito and she said it was too spicy and just \"ok\". There was nothing special about it and it looked like a big blob.
