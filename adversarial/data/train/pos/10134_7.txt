Mediocre management. We Made an online order and decided to change it so we called and they said they would cancel it with no problem. \"Re-ordered online with the changes we wanted. Guess what? \n\nThey delivered BOTH orders, charged my card and had no recollection of us calling to cancel\/change\/correct out online. \n\nGood food, good quality. Shotty customer service. Shitty attitude. \n\nKeep my $160 bucks folks- last dollar you make from us.
