I liked this place so much, I did 2 rooms in one day. Seriously. They have high quality rooms and great discounts, including industry nights (Mon & Tues, $20pp) and giveaways. They also give back to the community and host fundraisers! Plus their staff are great, especially Cheyenne.\n\nOriginally came in with Roger T and his family, who had an extra space in their group. We successfully made it out of the Jungala room, riffing on Jumanji. After completing our room, we got discount codes for future visits so I brought the BF for date night. Unfortunately, we got stuck on the last part of the Alcatraz room and didn't make it out- that room was difficult, especially with just 2 people, but Cheyenne was great about providing support and explaining where we went wrong.\n\nThe rooms themselves are extremely well done for an immersive experience. They have 7 total rooms, including a Game of Thrones theme room and another that reminds me of the Hunger Games. The pricing is fairly reasonable, regularly $32\/pp with various discounts and promos. Great for a group birthday or work team building activity.
