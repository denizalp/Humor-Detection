This is a fun park that is adjacent to the Premium Outlet Mall but a 5-minute drive to get there. Interesting street design so if you are in the park there is only one exit and it's the way you enter. If you want to take a short cut to the mall, this is NOT the way to go.\n\nThe park is designed to appeal to all ages with lots of open space and room to play soccer and baseball. There is a skateboard park attached. You can walk all the way around the park and get a good workout.\n\nThere is ample parking. There seemed to be a great many grounds workers busy making sure the park looked good when we were there.
