DO NOT GO HERE! I am a freshman and went here this afternoon before sorority rush launched. Basically, they ruined my nails. I needed a gel fill-in and it took literally 17 minutes. At my home salon, this process takes at least 45 minutes.  The lady who filled in my nails - cut me numerous times, there was hair in the nail polish, there was hair in the powder they put over the nails. I was COMPLETELY UPSET. My nails look like crap and I really didn't need this  the first day of rush. I will never go here again and will not recommend this place to anyone.
