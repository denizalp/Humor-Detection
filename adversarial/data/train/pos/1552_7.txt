Better than average.\n\nIt was pretty entertaining, and a good way to spend a night out. I was totally the youngest person in the audience, but still enjoyed it. I would rather see a cirque show, and I wouldn't see this again, but it's worth seeing it once I guess----it's definitely not for everyone....so girls, leave the BF or hubby at the craps tables!!
