I got married today and I brought my very small family wedding party here for drinks. The woman sweeping the floor had her purse on her shoulder, the hostess barely said two words and we waited for over 15 minutes with not a server in sight. Everyone decided we should go somewhere else and a woman at a table whom had been on her phone with HER purse on the table the entire time told us good bye have a great day. I can only think she worked there for making that comment. The hostess did not say a word as we left. Thanks wild wings. We ended up spending over $400 at Fleming's. Good job
