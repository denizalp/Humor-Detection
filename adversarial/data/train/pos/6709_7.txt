It took me awhile to visit this stadium, but after two spring training games, I'm hooked!\n\nThis is an excellent venue for Spring Training, and I'm sure it's great for all of the other events and festivals they host as well... I'll have to go back to see that first-hand though.\n\nAs for my two visits to date, I was pleased with the friendly staff, the bathroom situation, and the layout.  I had lawn seats both times, and that was fine... great people watching too!  The parking situation could use work, but it's not horrible.  The food options are what you'd expect, but I'd love to see a few more healthy options.  We had popcorn, peanuts, pretzel, beer, and water, and I saw plenty of people enjoying other options including barbecue, hot dogs, nachos, pizza, etc... \n\nI look forward to returning to Salt River Fields for more fun times with family and friends!
