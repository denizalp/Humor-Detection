Pep Boys offers good deals for new tires, oil changes, or other basic preventative maintenance service. This location has friendly staff and that's about it.\n\nThis Pep Boys is located in a very ghetto, dirty strip mall (I think in its hey day was once a Safeway and Thrifty Drug Store...). The waiting room is filthy & dirty and the restroom is pretty nasty too. The floors probably haven't seen a mop in years. I've seen much cleaner waiting rooms to \"wait\" while my car is being serviced.\n\nYou might even need another tire alignment after driving thru the pot-hole ridden parking lot.
