WARNING dishonest timeshare don't do business with this company! \n\nI am currently sitting in the Dennys restaurant at the property writing this review now and extremely disappointed with the untruthful business tactics of this timeshare company. \n\nTahiti Village resort does a bait and switch with their offer to stay at the resort while you tour it to potentially purchase a timeshare unit. The ad pictured a unit with a soaking tub, upon arrival at the front desk we were told the unit didn't have the tub pictures and it was the lowest level room available. We asked to be upgraded to the room in the ad with a tub and was told that they wouldn't upgrade us. I have a knee issue and cannot use a standard tub yet they still stuck to their dishonest bait and switch promotion. \n\nI spent my money to travel all the way to Las Vegas and was hoping to purchase a unit as I currency own at the grand view but was hoping to move closer to the big properties however I would not do business with a company that engages in dishonest business practices. \n\nI will be leaving reviews on Yelp, the better business bureau and rip off report to name a few. \n\nVery disappointing it have this kind of experience. \n\nThere are many timeshares who n LAS Vegas to choose from avoid Tahiti village timeshare resort. Two or another resort where they will be honest and upfront with you from the get-go!
