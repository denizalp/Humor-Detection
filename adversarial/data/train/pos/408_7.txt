They have a talented cast, but the directing needs review.  When you read the show's description, you may notice nothing specific.  I believe that's because the show is chaos.  The audience is distracted from the main performance by background dancing and visual displays.  The talent is real: it does not need a ridiculous story and a dance troupe.  Let them shine!    Crazy components:   Titanic piece is weird: the audience watches the performers drown as the ship sinks, the costumes and music do not match the stories' time periods, the show is oversexualized, and tries too hard to mimic a cirque format.  I don't see this show lasting unless there is a serious rewrite.
