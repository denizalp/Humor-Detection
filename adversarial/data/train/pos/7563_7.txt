This place is a diamond in the rough - the rough being an industrial-heavy strip on the Danforth.  Maybe macarons, croissants and cupcakes are just what heavy-duty-labour employees need to pent off some of their stress?  Whatever drew the owners to open up shop here, I'm glad they did.\n\nThis place is take-out only as there is no seating.  My sister claims that they make the best cupcakes in town (having tried cupcakes from For the Love of Cake, Bobbette and Belle, The Wedding Cake Shoppe, and the Design Cookie Boutique).  I've tried all those and more and I must admit that their cake base is one of the moister ones I've had.  My preference is for moist and airy cupcakes as opposed to the dense ones.  The frosting is not too heavy nor too greasy and the cupcakes are a decent size.  I also got a dozen of macarons to go just because I can never say no to macarons.  While the texture is spot on, I found their macaron offerings to be a tad bit on the overly sweet side, but definitely a steal at $2.\n\nI also tried some of their coffee - I think they should stick to pastries.  It was pretty awful.
