To be honest, I personally might not have made the effort to try the one-star Michelin rated Michael Mina, tucked away in the corner of the Bellagio Conservatory & Botanical Gardens, if not for either for sizable gambling winnings, or Las Vegas Restaurant Week.  Fortunately (unfortunately..?), it was the latter in my case.\n\nFor being such a fancy-schmancy dining establishment, there is quite a bit of noise and hustle and bustle going on here.  The kitchen line is (mostly) open for diners to view the madness that would usually be going on behind the scenes.  Also, servers rush around performing tasks like folding your napkin (or giving you a new one) when you excuse yourself from the table for a few minutes, or cut and deconstruct your lobster pot pie for you.\n\nAside from the entrees, I initially found it amusing and\/or ironic that the 3 course pre-fixe dinner options included such items as a foo-foo version of a quarter grilled cheese sandwich with the soup appetizer choice ($16), and a fancy root beer float ($15) for dessert.  Although quite tasty, I realized that having such items appear on a triple-figure dinner bill might actually have made the joke on me.\n\nOverall, a satisfying meal and experience.  The environment is rather hectic, but the service is very good.  The food is exceptional, but I would not come back without either a Restaurant Week pre-fixe menu offered, or a huge stack of winnings to splurge with.
