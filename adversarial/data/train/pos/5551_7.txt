I love this pizza and I think the owner is totally cool.  I just wish he had a location closer to me so I could get my Giant Rustic fix more often.  \n\nThe pizza is GIANT if you order their biggest pie and I recommend you try it!  If you like pepperoni, it is some of the best I have ever had, loaded with flavor.  Not to say all the ingredients here are not wonderful, the pepperoni just shines.  Every topping I have tried here has been fresh and awesome though.\n\nThis isn't a fancy \"Wood Fired\" or \"Coal Fired\" pie, but it doesn't need to be.  Cooked to perfection every time and delicious!\n\nSW corner of 40th St. & Camelback - Check them out now!
