OK, for those of you who know me, you know that I'm forgetful.  When left unsupervised, as I was this weekend, I forgot to do somewhat important things (i.e. eat meals, shave, feed the fish...).  With that being said, on Saturday night after a day of working around the house, I realized that I was out of wine, and on my way to Safeway, I saw America's Taco shop was open.  I got a few bottles of wine for the night and went back down 7th, and got to America's seconds before 8pm.  Yes, they do close at 8pm on the weekends.  They gladly took my order and I sat and waited.  I always HATE being that guy who comes in right at close.  Thankfully, a couple came in close to 8:15 and they were just as nice to them as they were to me.  The owner\/husband (I presume) came out and made small talk with me, and was very nice.\nAnyways, I digress.  I got the Carne Burrito, and the flavor was amazing!  I asked for the Pico on the side and got a good size portion of it.  I will be going back for more!  I want to try everything on the menu like Dyl W did.  \nIf I don't forget to eat again today, I'm going to get the tacos.
