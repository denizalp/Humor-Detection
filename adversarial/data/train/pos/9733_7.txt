I went here yesterday with my diva sister because she's raved about this place before; however, I was not very satisfied. It would have been a much better experience had the techs actually talked to us like we were people instead of gossiping with themselves in their native language and looking at us like we were beneath them. Not to mention my tech got a little instrument happy (similar to the dental hygienist and her scrapey thing) and ended up cutting my finger. That's when I really got ticked off. She doesn't know me but I'm kind of a germophobe and things like that TOTALLY ruin the ENTIRE experience for me. Don't think I'll be going back.
