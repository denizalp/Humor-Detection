I don't care what people say! Shake shack was amazing! Something so simple, mastered to perfection! Every bite was filled with melted cheese and meat cooked perfectly!\n\nItem ordered: chicken shack burger with cheddar cheese fries! \n\nI don't care about the rivalry between in n out and shake shack! They are both different and offer something unique to the table. Shake shack really stood out to me. The flavor gives you a kick of freshness with the taste of rich cheese and a well cooked chicken breast. Things got even better when we tried the bacon cheddar cheese fries! The melted cheesed was Fire! And the bacon pieces gave it an amazing tase.  \n\nOverall, I really enjoyed shake shack! The menu was straight forward and the service was fast for a restaurant in vegas! Plenty of seating available! Just a great burger! Can't wait to go back.
