I gave it 1 star because there isn't a zero star. The rudest people and they are proud of it. Go there if you are looking for abuse with microwave quality food in a place that is so loud there is no way to talk to the people at your table without shouting as loud as you can.\nSave your money and time and get a microwave box of Italian food and stay home and I guarantee you will have a better meal and more fun. \nThis place is aweful!!
