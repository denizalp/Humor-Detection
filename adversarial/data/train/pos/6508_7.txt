Is it fair to rate a cafe purely on their bathrooms?  I mean, seriously, either the designers at Noir are geniuses, or we Torontonians have gotten used to some really bad loos out there. \n\nIt occurred to me, looking at the rich-dark-wood-stylish-sink-ultra-clean bathroom at Noir, that it rarely phases me to be out at a restaurant where I'd drop $20 for a main, only to go downstairs to a dark and seedy underbelly.  But no more!  I call on restaurants and cafes all over Toronto to take a field trip to Noir and see what a classy joint really looks like.\n\nThere.  I've said my piece.  The coffee's good, too.
