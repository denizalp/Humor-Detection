First, you need to plan ahead, You need a reservation if you are going with a group.\nPro-tip: Make reservation, otherwise you will be waiting a long time or possibly not even able to dine here.\n\nParking:  This is Vegas.  Valet at the hotel.\n\nService: Great. They worked well as a team. Several requests for extra bread\/plates\/etc were fulfilled quietly and efficiently.\n\n\nFood: \nSalumi e Formaggi: ($69)\nWe started with meat and cheese platter. Server knew each and every cut of meat and type of cheese. It is pretty large. You will need a decent group to devour.\n\nWe shared several pizzas, sandwiches, and salads.\nGorgonzola kale ($16) - I did not try.\nFaro Salad ($15)  - Not bad\nRomaine salad with Chicken ( $28)  Typical romaine salad.  Nothing outstanding.\n\nPro-tip: Don't order the lobster roll. Not worth the 35 bucks (Oct 2014 price).\nTenderloin sliders ($30)  I did not try it.  But, heard it was not that moist.\n\nSalumi Picante Pizza ($16) It was yummy in my tummy.\nPancetta Egg pizza ($16)  Pancetta and sunny side egg on top.  Do I need to say anymore?  \n\nG's baked pasta ($24)  Their version of an individual lasagna.  It was pretty good.\nSmall portion so terrible for sharing.\n \nDownside: We did not see nor get any pictures taken with Giada.\n\nWe tried Giada's Sangria ($15)  The red was better than their white.\nSo order the red.  \n\n\nPro-tip: Don't forget to take pictures in their photobooth. \nThe printer was not working during our visit. Boohoo but you can email yourself the pictures.\n\nOverall, this place has great pizza and service. I would recommend. Just make sure to bring $$$.  This is 3.5 stars.
