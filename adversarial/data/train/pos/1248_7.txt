Solidly mediocre. My first time there was a but rushed & confusing. I walked in the door & was immediately asked to order before I had a chance to look at the menu.\n\nSo I decided to keep it simple & get a cheeseburger & fries. I was underwhelmed. If I am going to eat something that's going to make my ass even bigger, then it better taste fantastic.\n\nLenny's meh, I'll skip it.
