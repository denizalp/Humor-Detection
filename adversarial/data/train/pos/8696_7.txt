In an age where teenagers are getting $10-$25 an hour to babysit children (yes, that's live HUMAN beings), I find it astonishing that an AZ pet sitting service would have the audacity to charge $32 for a 1\/2 hour cat visit! If you do the math, that's $64\/hour folks, and nearly double the rate I paid in California (which is far more costly in nearly every service area than AZ, especially for taxes, gas and groceries). In LA, for that rate, you could get an overnight stay from a cat sitter and $40 for a dog sitter. So for an AZ service to charge a high rate, I figured the service better be damn good! And with high Yelp ratings, I would expect nothing less than perfect customer service.\n\nI contacted this pet sitting service after being called out of town for a last minute business trip. I had no time to prepare and they were available and amenable and had excellent reviews (not sure where those came from), so I thought \"surely, they must be superb.\" Um wrong...not so much.\n\nOn the one hand, they made themselves available in a pinch. On the other, they were so over focused on fees it is astonishing. I received an initial quote of $31\/HR based on general location and as soon as they received my actual address, the first thing they did was increase the rate another dollar an hour. Wow. Really. Greedy. Not a great first impression. Again, I was in a pinch so I said yes. \n\nThis service did not ask me a single thing about my pets (in hindsight, big red flag). No questions on distinguishing characteristics, which pet is which, quirks, personality or food needs. Wow.\n\nI had literally just moved into my home, was not even finished unpacking boxes yet and days before my unexpected business trip me and the cats had driven 19 hours straight through the night after rescuing one of my two cats from a horrific hoarding situation. \n\nI wrote an extensive email about what the cats had gone through and that they were distressed as was I (especially to have to leave my babies behind so soon after such a traumatizing situation). I asked to be texted to give me updates, a no brainer! I received a precursory text day one of my trip and then nothing for the next 3 days. When asked what was going on, I got an \"oh, we didn't realize you wanted to be texted everyday.\" Hello, if you are charging $64\/hour for pet sitting service you better be anticipating your customers every need and providing high touch customer service. My sitters in Santa Monica and Ojai texted me regularly and went way above and beyond this service. They asked about collecting mail, watering yard\/plants, made sure to get vet contacts, cat illness history, and reassured me daily all was well.\n\nI came home to litter kicked out of the two cat pans on the floor of both bathrooms, the guest bathroom toilet filthy from an adult taking a #2. Um, there was a toilet bowl brush next to the toilet. Common courtesy would dictate you take care of that shit (pun intended) since it's not your home and you're being paid to be there.\n\nNext, my home, which I wasn't even fully moved into yet, was partially rearranged. Like don't touch my stuff ok?! If I put a cat post in a window parallel to the window, I do not want to come home and find it moved to an angle because that's how the pet sitter would put it in her home or decorations moved around because you think they would look better that way, or my cat carriers moved to where the cats can't get into them with the doors closed. Cats are notorious for needing quiet dark, familiar places and both these cats were using the carriers to feel comfortable being in moving chaos and the carriers had been moved and the doors shut. WTF?\n\nNext, in the food department at least one if not two full cans of wet cat food were overstuffed into bowls by the kitchen. Way to attract ants and bugs people. Cats eat at most 1\/2 to a 1\/4 of a can of cat food at a time. Leaving dry food out is fine, the wet food was a waste of expensive food to leave it that way.\n\nOn my way home, I texted the sitter (different from the business owner) with instructions on where to leave key and got a sarcastic \"yes ma'am.\" Since you are supposed to be a professional and this is your first time working for me, you don't have the familiarity and intimacy to make a joke like that which fell flat. Do yourself a favor, don't make jokes until after you have established a personal relationship with your clients!\n\nThe owner, who mentioned I could pay her via PayPal, was far more concerned about the fact that when I paid her selecting \"vendor\/service\" criteria, that she would be charged a fee, than she was that I had returned safely, that the animals were ok and had received the care they needed. She texted 3x about this and never once asked whether the animals were ok, again indicating an over focus on money and what's best for the pet sitting service than the needs of the customer and their pets!
