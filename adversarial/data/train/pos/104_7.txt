Doesn't matter if you make the best food in the world, because if the service is lousy the restaurant is lousy. I chose to come here on my birthday yesterday I have all the restaurants and hotels in the world at Tuscany Suites. I'm sorry I ever came-due to the unprofessional inattentive servers,\n I got no service no one took my order after 15 minutes, and I had to attend a show which was a total farce. (Because the performers at the rat pack is back we're different than the ones that I thought I was getting you could sing on key.)\n\nI asked what do you do for birthdays and they said oh we do nothing. Marilyn's doesn't have one dessert listed on their menu and I asked pacifically bring me something cake or something with a candle they couldn't even do that!\nFinally, after having the most un-festive birthday I ever paid for in history, I went back to Marilyn's  at one of the morning and the manager on duty found a massive dessert platter and put a candle on it and she sang happy birthday to me.\n Why the hell couldnt they have done that when they were supposed to?\n Why was I told they don't do anything for birthdays, no cake,  no ice cream etc?
