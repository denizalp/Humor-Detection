So I've been here a total of two times . And first impression was eh small business trying to make it maybe ill give it a shot help the people out. Sure why not I'm all for that . However first time I came they were rude, but the amount of food was good for the price. \n\nIt's located in the Vons center right across the street from unlv , so it's pretty convenient considering I spend most of my time at school. The lunch specials are good, however service is extremely slow. \nDecorations are nice however I don't think I will comeback due to the horrible service despite the large amount of food and convenience .
