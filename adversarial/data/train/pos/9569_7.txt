Staying in Henderson this Cheesecake Factory was the first I've visited which I didn't have to wait for seating at dinner. I was seated at a booth which I requested and was comfy.\n\nMy friendly waitress greeted me asap and gave me a menu with the large variety of choices to choose from. I ended up going with the Salmon Miso which was topped on steamed rice and served with pea pods. The fish was fresh & moist and the miso sauce went good when combined with the rice and pods. Instead of going with a fancy cheesecake I chose the original which was served with whipped cream. The cheesecake was silky smooth and creamy and not overly rich but filling.\n\nOverall for me - the large variety of choices, good quality in a pleasant atmosphere make Cheescake Factory a solid choice to dine.
