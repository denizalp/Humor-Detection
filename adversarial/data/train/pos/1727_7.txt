i don't particularly like french ________ (women, men, airline, wine, kiss), and i especially don't have any affinity for french food except for french fries and french toast.  when i booked a table for bachelorette party dinner for 10 girls at daniel boulud, it never registered to me that it was a french restaurant.  i read every single yelp review and looked up the menu before hand, and was sure i made the best choice.  after all, the restaurant was at wynn, the most extravagant hotel in vegas.\n\nwe arrived at 6:30, and were seated promptly at their terrace outside, facing the beautiful landscape with waterfall and man-made lake surrounded by trees.  this was the most beautiful restaurant i've ever dined in!!!  their 3 course prix fixe meal was offered until 7pm for $48 (very un-french), and many of us opted for it.  we also chose a bottle of white french wine to go with our dinner, upon recommendation by the sommelier.  \n\nour attentive waiter brought out my 1st course, caesar salad, and it was the best salad i had.  i also tasted chilled potato soup with leek, and it was quite tasty as well.  the 2nd course was loup de mer (sea bass, and this is when it hit me that i was eating french food).  it was nicely pan fried with the skin on, sitting atop some mashed potato and cauliflower.  the fish was really moist and light, and it's garnish with pine nuts was not over powering at all.  my 3rd course was a finger size hazelnut chocolate cake with mango sorbet.  the sorbet on top of chocolate cookie crumbs was extraordinary (this coming from a person who doesn't eat tropical fruits!).\n\nalthough all dishes came out in small portions (now that's very french), i was very satisfied with my meal and did not have that \"sh*t, what a waste of money\" feeling afterward.\n\namidst all this loveliness, we had to witness the most disturbing and grotesque water show which was displayed every hour.  how distasteful for a restaurant like this and for a hotel like this.  it was almost an insult!!!  please, GET RID of this.\n\noverall, it was a very pleasant experience to me and my party of 10.  i would definitely come again for a romantic dinner or celebration.
