My last and probably best stop on the Winterlicious-see-how-fat-we-can-make-Jacob 2014 tour! \nTo start me and my guest decided to try the wine pairings with our courses and split each dish, so we could each try 6 dishes and glasses of wine. Awesome idea..unless you REALLY want to finish a dish because it's great! Haha. And with the food at Jump we ran into that conundrum more than once.\nThe appetizers were a pumpkin soup and a dinosaur kale and ricotta salad...which I'm not ashamed to say was ordered purely on the basis of having 'dinosaur' in the name, heh. It was tart and delicious with small chunks of fig going nicely with the ricotta and kale. The pumpkin soup was OK, but not really to my taste because of the crab in the soup.\nFor mains, we had goat cheese stuffed Atlantic salmon and braised beef cheeks on bean ragout. I'd like to talk about the salmon, but it was so good that I barely got any by the time my dinner partner was done with it. Haha. The beef cheeks were well done and the white bean ragout they were on was also tasty.\nFor dessert I finally had the chance to have the much talked about (thanks Phillip S. lol) traditional bread and butter pudding. It was a large square chunk of dense raisin bread in an amazing caramel sauce topped with vanilla ice cream. This thing is insane: the sauce is incredibly rich and decadent and it all comes together incredibly well. I'd come back here for this alone. Also, there was a white chocolate panna cotta, but who cares really because: BREAD PUDDING.\nThe wine pairings were great: light white wines with the fish, heavy reds with the beef, and sweet dessert wines with the pudding and panna cotta. Overall, a very satisfying and delicious meal. \nI'll make the trip here in the future...if only to have more bread pudding.
