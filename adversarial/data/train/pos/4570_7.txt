Check in was pretty easy. The elevator up to our room wouldn't let us choose our floor. When we got to our room it was filthy. The door in was dirty. There was yucky stuff that I could wipe off the ceiling in the bathroom. There was something dripping down the closet doors. Also something gross on the headboard of the bed. So much white in the room...walls, cabinets, doors, curtains and none of it was clean. When we asked for an upgraded room, we were told that we were already in the upgraded room. The upgraded room doesn't offer hair conditioner. If I wasn't staying here for a work conference, I would check out and stay some place else. Do not stay here. \nPictures included are just some of the pics I took. Other pics included hair in the bathtub and some kind of brownish splatter on the tub wall.
