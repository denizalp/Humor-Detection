I read all the other reviews and I did not get the same service that everyone else got. I walked in yesterday hoping that I would get the help that I needed to get started. I stood in the front counter waiting for someone to help me. When finally I get a \" can I help you \" \n\nI told this person that I wanted to know what I needed to get started and what should I purchase just to get me going. He pointed that two items \" this one and this one \" then started talking to one of his friends that walked into the shop. I was shocked I came in expecting to buy a kit but after that there is no way I'm going to spend my money here. \n\nI went to Pink Spot Vapors now that's the place that know how to treat new and old customers.
