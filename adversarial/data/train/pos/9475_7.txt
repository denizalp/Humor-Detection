Airport prices. Check.\nAirport quality-HELL NO.\nGreat guacamole, in house made chips served warm with a nicely balanced salsa. Easily one of the best ribeye steak taco platter I have ever had and the hot off the homemade press corn tortillas and interesting quinoa\/kale salad made for a fabulous texture, flavor mix. \n\nIf I would have had more time, I would have indulged in an adult beverage and possibly had more room for the one bite of dessert I could shovel in before having to run through security. \n\nYes, good enough to visit the real deal somewhere in town but great enough to make a little extra airport time to indulge.
