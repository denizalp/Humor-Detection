Pancakes, waffles, skillets the menu is quite extensive.\nPortions are generous and pricing is decent.\n\n-Coffee $2.99\n-banana pancake $6.69\n-chocolate chip pancake $6.69\n-garden omelette $10.99\n\nThe Coffee was perfect and refilled every time.\npancakes are huge about the size of a dinner plate, a small portion is good for one person.\nI wasn't particularly a fan of the protein pancakes they are not your usual fluffy ones.\nThe eggs came with a side of muffin and hash.\nMy muffin was burnt and the hash wasn't done but the server was quick to change them once i pointed that out.\n\n\nI would love to try the other items on the menu but the service was much better than the food.\n\nCheers!
