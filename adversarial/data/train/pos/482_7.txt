They are definitely nice there but my hot stone massage basically consisted of 15 minutes lying on my stomach waiting for esthetician, 15 minutes her finding a massage oil that she 'liked', actual 15 minutes of massage and then 15 minutes to get changed, which I obviously didn't need. Manicure and pedicure were good though!
