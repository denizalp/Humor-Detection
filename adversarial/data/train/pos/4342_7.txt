Stepping into M & M World is like stepping into Charlie and the Chocolate Factory!  There is candy everywhere!  It's 4 stories of chocolate goodness.  If you go up to the 3rd floor, you'll find the theater to watch the M & M short 3D film.  It's 15 minutes long and cute.  It's worth the wait.  It's basically a cartoon wrapped up into a long commercial.  But it is an experience.  The top floor has the M & M racing car which provides for a nice photo op.  Second floor is the wall to wall M & M chocolates where you can pick your very own colors, nuts, or try the new flavors (chili).  The second floor also has their M & M Star Wars merchandise.  More merchandise and check out on the first floor.  Even though this is a candy store, I like the fact that they do sell more than just candy.  My daughter wanted an M & M nightgown instead of purchasing a bagful of chocolates.  They have plenty of M & M product shirts, toys, mugs, etc.  This store is located along the strip, extremely busy, but the staff is friendly.  Do plan to spend money if you're into cute stuff.  Next door is the Coca Cola store.
