Holy fuckamole this shit is expensive.  I need a funny meme to describe the look on my face when I checked my bank account the next day.  Like, what the fuck did I even buy here? \n\nMy cousin and I had spent days going back and forth on what would be the cheapest day to buy 8 wristbands and fair the fuck out from open to close.  Sunday looked the best because it had $5 entry before 2pm and $50 wristbands.  \n\nThe fair opened at 11 am and we arrived at 10:45 and paid the $5 parking lot off Encanto and 19th Ave - very easy access to the gate - there's no reason to pay more than that for parking.  I highly recommend arriving early.  We had the place all to ourselves at 11 am on a Sunday.  No lines!  That didn't last long.  By 1:00 pm it started to get crowded, by 7:00 pm it was nuts to butts.
