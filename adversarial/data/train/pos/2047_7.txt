I'm writing this review as a walk in. I didn't stay here nor did I gamble and I did not even eat here. So why write a review? Just based on ambience and decor and looks this place took me to another land. I've never been to asia but this what I imagine an asian resort and casino would be like. The beauty and layout was awesome. The casino was very modern and the shops were very expensive.Louis Vuitton, shoes that costs 900.00. they took one look at me and thought \"lookie loo\" I was wearing my Kohls 70% markdown polo shirt..But the place is beautiful and I would love to stay here. When I do I will write another boring review
