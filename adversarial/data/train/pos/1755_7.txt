The Gluch Group helped my fianc√© and I buy our first home and we received spectacular service from them, from beginning to end. They were extremely patient, responded to all of our texts and calls quickly, and most importantly worked tirelessly on our behalf through some pretty tense negotiations and made sure the deal came through in the end in our favor. We are now proud homeowners and am glad to have met and worked with such a great group of people. I wholeheartedly recommend that you use them to buy or sell a home.
