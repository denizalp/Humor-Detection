Did you know there are three different spots to grab coffee at the corner of Queen and John? There's the World's Worst Starbucks™ on the Northeast corner if you're feeling stupid. And there's Wanda's Waffles on the Northwest corner with their Illy coffee and 6000 calorie desserts. And then there's good ol' reliable, Canadian, tree-coloured, Southwesterly 'scup. \n\nTheir slogan was once, \"where the world stops for a second,\" and that's just about as long as you'll want to spend in this tiny café. It's cramped and the lights are painfully bright. Service is always pretty friendly here, even though the girls behind the counter always assume I'm trying to pick them up. I'm not. I just flirt with whomever is bringing me the jolt my bloodstream so desperately craves. It's called ADDICTION, ever heard of it?\n\nAnyway. It's too busy to ever be able to sit here and the coffee: it is what it is. Grab a cup and continue on to Rudsak or wherever else you were going.\n\nObligatory Title Pun: SECOND only to decent cafés in the city.\n\nMenu Readability: Whateves.\n\nNeed to mention: There is a patio in the summer.\n\nWhat this place teaches me about myself: I used \"it is what it is\" and I hate myself for it.
