Considering fried rice is their namesake dish, I was distinctly underwhelmed by the one I tried.\n\nPROS:\nThe fresh-made egg on top of the rice is a nice touch. Service is polite, space is very clean, portions are more than generous considering the low prices.  Many will appreciate that you can customize your fried rice, such as without egg, or adding french fries (which I was asked upon ordering and found bizarre).\n\nCONS: \nFried rice is on the plain side, consists mostly of bulk-purchase peas and carrots.  But  the hefty shake of black pepper tossed on my order was awful and off-putting, it didn't make the dish spicy, just peppery and unappealing.\nThe curry chicken was okay- curry sauce that didn't have much heat or flavor. Disliked the large amount of peas and carrots that seemed to be incorporated into the curry.
