I had a cupcake from here.. it was 6-7 dollars. total ripoff because it wasn't any good. it was dry and the cake part didnt stick together. \n\nI had a sandwich from the place across from the sugar factory and the sanwich was amazing and only 5.99.\n\nhonest opinion...I just think the sugar factory is really pretty and over hyped. :\\ nice on the eyes but not on the mouth.
