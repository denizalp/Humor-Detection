This is the absolute worst cheese ball show I have ever seen in my life. What a waste of money and time and we left early.  Although, it's evident that there are hard working and talented cast members.  The show just doesn't come together and the weird science dude who yells all the time and whines; not sure what that is about!  Go see a Cirque du Soleil show and then rate this one.
