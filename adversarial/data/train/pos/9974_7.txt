I can never go wrong coming to Jun's to satisfy a quick, cheap and pretty good Korean meal. I always order their kalbi which comes in 3 pieces of thinly sliced short ribs, rice, salad and their complimentary side dishes as a staple in any Korean cuisine. \n\nThe kalbi has nice charred grilled marks. It also has a marination without the sweetness over powering the meat. The kalbi compliments well with a nice touch of acidity and a little sweetness from the salad dressing. The mandoo wrapper seemed thicker than other places,  but it does have a flavorful taste. \n\nThe place is not that big, but still has a comfortable atmosphere feel without all the fancy decor. The staff and service are always great. This location about equals to their other location on Craig. Again, great place to dine in with good portion sizes to fill up my hunger any day of the week!
