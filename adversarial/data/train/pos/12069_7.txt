After craving Chinese buffet for a while, I finally made a trip to Tokyo Grill. This place is pretty good buffet joint by far. I may have found a new favorite buffet! There are plenty of seats, good, and clean food. A lot of selections, the best hibachi, and the best sushi buffet I've ever had with inexpensive price. Sashimi is very huge compared to other sushi places. My favorite part is fried blue crabs. Hands down!\nThey have a lot of ice cream selections, plus they offer oreo cookies and whip cream, just wow.\n4 stars for some menus that too sweet. \nStaffs are also very friendly and attentive.\nI recommend this place if you are not picky and have very high expectations for a buffet place.
