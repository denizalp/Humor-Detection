I keep changing my mind whether this place deserves 3 stars or 4 stars. If you're concerned about authenticity then, yes in terms of food and service but with a touch of Vegas. What the heck do I mean by that?\n\nIf you go to China\/ Hong Kong\/ Macau, you can't really expect great service. The sooner they can get you out of the restaurant, the better so they can get more customers. That's good business. Don't expect a smile or warm fuzzies. But at Pearl Ocean, you only get that 60% of that vibe. Our server was smiley, friendly and apologetic for hiccups. Whereas in China, if they make a mistake they get mad at you for pointing it out.\n\nThe food...there were some dishes that were really well-executed and some that were just ok.\n\nMongolian Beef Buns:\n3 buns stuffed with Mongolian beef (I feel like I just rephrased it). These were ok. Tasty, meaty but greasy 3\/5.\n\nShrimp Dumplings with XO Sauce:\nSlightly spicy. Dumpling skin a bit chewy 3\/5.\n\nPork Dumpling in Chili Peanut Sauce:\nThis was a bit misleading. I did not taste peanut at all. I got spicy burning yet cool on the tongue - like if you licked your skin with Ben Gay by accident or experimentally lick a strip of Salonpas, this was exactly like that! But if you do enjoy Szechuan dishes, this dish might be for you 2\/5.\n\nFive Guys Xiao Long Bao:\nI have every reason to like this. The colors were appealing and you get a variety. Each tastes great and unique. My favorite would have to be the Squid Ink and Truffle. Yum! Perfect skin: soup: meat ratio. These are huge. We ordered 3 of these but I'm glad they only gave us 1 order 5\/5.\n\nBoiled Beef Belly with Enoki:\nIt's as exciting as the name \"boiled Beef\" implies. Nothing spectacular but they only have a few beef dishes on the menu that's why we got this. What is logic? 2\/5\n\nBBQ Pork Puff:\nWe didn't really order these but somehow they landed on our table and we ate and paid for them anyway. Flakey pastry with meat inside. We liked them 4\/5.\n\nOven-Roasted Duck:\nDuck is fatty. I like my duck well-rendered to cut some of the fat off. The skin wasn't as crisp as I would've preferred. I've had better duck 2\/5.\n\nRoasted Pork Belly:\nOh, yes! This was fantastic! Fatty but meaty. The skin was super crunchy. One of the best I've had in Vegas 5\/5.\n\nBBQ Pork Crisp Rice Roll:\nSweet and savory. Great contrast of textures - soft chewy and crispy. Delightful! 4\/5.\n\nMango Pudding:\nLight yet creamy and mildly sweet. It's not artificial tasting at all. You can taste mango and a bit of coconut 5\/5.\n\nEgg Custard Tart (Dan Tat):\n3 tiny warm egg tarts. Same quality as everywhere else 3\/5.\n\nPortuguese Egg Tart (Pasteis de Nata):\n2 big warm egg tarts of the Portuguese kind (sweeter and bigger than Dan Tat). The last time I had these was when I went to Lisbon a few years ago (Pasteis de Belem) and they were the best. These weren't as good but I'll happily take them because I have no other choice 5\/5.\n\nIt was interesting how we got our desserts before the savory entrees. We got stuff we didn't order and the ones we did order, we almost didn't get. We also got the same dishes brought to our table twice. There's obviously a lack of organization and communication going on but they've only been open a few days\/weeks and I'm hopeful that would improve. Now, here's the kicker: price. Some items are priced on the menu while the others are a surprise. But for dim sum, this place is quite expensive.
