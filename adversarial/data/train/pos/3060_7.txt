Boring pricey food. I know it's suppose to be healthy but healthy doesn't mean it has to be bland. \n\nOrdering here is horrid. I couldn't imagine coming here with a group of 5 people. It would seriously take 30 minutes for everyone to look through and order on the iPad. \n\nI didn't understand why they didn't have chicken option with the Cesar wrap or salad? I ordered the steak Cesar wrap and it was so bland. The steak was a little tough also. I had to drown my wrap with hot sauce and dressing to get the flavor going. What's up with the rock hard croutons? It didn't compliment the wrap at all and kept getting in the way of my chewing.\n\nWhen we were finishing up with our meal, the guy came over to give us the check and he waited. Okay my friend wasn't back from the bathroom and so I told him to wait. \n\nWhen we actually paid and got back the receipt he just waited and watched us write the gratuity! \n\nDefinitely won't having krayvings here!
