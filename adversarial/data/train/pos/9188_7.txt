Would not recommend for Sunday Brunch.\n\nWhen I worked in Concord, during the week this was one of my favorite lunch spots. Good food, nice atmosphere and a great place to continue business discussions.\n\nNoticed that they now have a Sunday Brunch that starts at 11 am which is early enough for us to get there from Church, have Brunch and get back home in time for my football maniac wife to catch the 1 pm NFL kickoff\n\nArrived just after 11 and as soon as we walked in, we had a problem.  The phone rang, the hostess answered it and proceeded to take a reservation. Two other employees were standing there just waiting.  I could understand it if if the hostess controlled the flow but just as she hung up, one of the two employees standing there, took it on herself to seat us  They could have done that when we walked in the door.\n\nNice atmosphere and they took our drink orders quickly.  My wife ordered the Steak Salad and I ordered the mini crabcake Eggs Benedict.  My wifes order came out ok but I ended up with Turkey Bacon Eggs Benedict which is a big difference.\n\nThey did correct it for which I give them credit. \n\nThe Benedict was way too salty and as for the English Muffin, it was more like an over cooked English Cracker. Did not make for a very good dining experience\n\nIn the end, we ended up sitting there for an eternity until my wife flagged down our server to get our check.  Almost created chaos because Mama does not like to miss her football.\n\nAs for myself, I went to the Greek Festival in Charlotte\n\nAll in all, great during the week but would not recommend Sunday Brunch.
