This is a convenient location with decent service, but there were a few glitches during my visit. \n\nThe first girl who helped me was very nice and I put my order in with her but then another girl stepped in. She seemed to be attempting to expedite the orders but all she succeeded in doing is confusing everyone and making it take longer. \n\nSince I had already made my requests with the first girl it was a little annoying that she required me to reiterate my order with her. She misheard me and ended up putting the wrong proteins in my order. When I told her about the mistake she seemed annoyed and then the whole line got discombobulated as they had to redo my order and couldn't figure out how to expedite that while handling all the orders behind me. \n\nOnce they got everything back on track things went smoothly but I was a little perturbed about her attitude. \n\nFood was decent once I got it home and everyone but that one particular employ was fine.
