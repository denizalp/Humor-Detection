Thank you, Lonie. I appreciate you taking the time to reply. And you know my review wasn't malicious, just a factual accounting of how the visit unfolded. My brother's tip $? I wasn't aware, but I think that's how he expressed his feeling of also being non-plussed. \n\nCuriously, I did receive a Yelp \"compliment\" from a certain male related to Nosh & Swig soon after my review. This compliment simply stated, \"You're a bitch.\" So you might want to check with your cook-husband (or other partners?) to see if they felt the need to reach out to me in that particular way. [Definitely not returning, now... Who knows what would befall my food.]\n\nLastly, I've had no less than 10 \"thank you's\" from fellow Yelpers regarding my review. Safe to say that I'm not alone in wondering where the overly generous 5-star reviews are coming from. Good yelpers aren't so easily impressed. 5-stars are rare, and usually hard-earned; saved for the highest level of culinary (and consumer) enjoyment.\n\nGood luck and continue with the improvements. Make sure you let the good reviews happen organically and honestly. And maybe take the Yelp keys away from whomever thinks its ok to be nasty to us patrons.
