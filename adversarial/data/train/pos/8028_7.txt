I hadn't actually been to a Journeys since around 1998 until this past week. I mostly agree with Shannon C., but the \"service\" is that type of really annoying, clingy service where the guy follows you around and asks you tons of questions. And then they try to sell you so much more stuff than necessary. It's ridiculous. I'm definitely more likely to buy something if the salespeople aren't pushy. But they do have really fun shoes.
