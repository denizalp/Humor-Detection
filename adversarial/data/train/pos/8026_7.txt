2\/2016\n\nSo here it goes ~Am I a fan of PDQ?\n\nWell I have to say I have never heard of this place before stopping here the other night.\nIt was bright from the road so we decided to check it out.\n\nWe went in not knowing what we were in store for. \n\nThe first thing I seen they carried was Cherwine Soda! We do not drink much soda anymore but being a fan of this soda from back east I we had to get one to share. They do charge a .10 up charge to get instead of the fountain drink.\n\nStaff was very friendly. The girl at the register was great. She was pleasant and very helpful after we told her it was our first time here.\nThe place was clean and not busy at all. Of course just being after Christmas I am sure everyone was home eating left overs and it was New Years Eve everyone was getting ready to party! \n\nWell we both decided on the buffalo chicken sandwich with fries. We were told of a couple of other sides we decided to get the blueberry coleslaw as a extra just to try it.\n\nWe do not go to fast food that often so believe it or not have not have not tried the new soda machines with all the flavors in it. That alone is amazing! We did get the sweet tea which was pretty good, not real sweet.\n\nWe did try a couple of sauces on the side with the fries. The sweet sriracha one is good and blue cheese was ok, and got some buffalo sauce to dunk the sandwich in.\n\nSo the verdict ~\nThe fries were homemade ~ They give you a bunch, I suggest eating them fast because when they get cold they are not that good. \nThe sandwich ~ Not enough sauce on it, it was kinda dry, luckily we asked for some sauce on the side to use. The bread not sure what the roll is they used but it was a bit dry kinda stale tasting. We should have went up and said something but we don't usually complain and it was edible as long as you had your drink with it. \nThe chicken? Was good. Being a fan of Canes Chicken it is hard to compare. The chicken was tender and moist and had a good flavor to it.\nThe blueberry coleslaw. We both say skip! It is not that good. Kinda of a dry coleslaw. We both were not fans of it at all until I added a packet of mayo to it. Then it was not too bad. We would not get this again,\n\nWould we go back? Maybe to try at another time to get one of the chicken dinners not a sandwich or the coleslaw.\n\nIt was not a WOW factor for us. It was not disgusting and we would suggest everyone to try for yourself.  It is a nice place and clean that is a plus!\n \nJust eat your fries first!
