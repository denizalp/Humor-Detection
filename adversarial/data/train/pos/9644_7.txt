If you happen to drive down The Strip and pass Encore, it is likely that you will see a line out the door from some mysterious store front. That, my friends, is the throng of people waiting to get their hands on some authentic Mexican tacos. Tacos El Gordo doesn't have much competition in the area so it is natural to see hordes of people crowding their 3 Vegas locations.\n\nTIP: There are separate lines for tacos. There is normally someone standing at the door to direct people to the appropriate lines but if you're like me and tend to order the unique meats e.g. Cabezza, Buche, Lengua, make sure to go inside and go to the line on the furthest right (closest to the bathroom). It's always the shorter line. If you're looking to order a bit of everything, those lines will typically be the longest. There are also 2 lines if you're looking to order the Adobada, which is El Gordo's version of the al pastor. \n\nTheir meats are some of the most tender I've ever had but when it lacks flavor, you're just eating flavorless chewy meat. I had to pack on the onions and sauces to give it some life. They're supposed to be known for the Adobada but I found it to lack any sort of spice. They top it off with a small slice of pineapple but I was looking more for spice than sweet. \n\nCabeza -- Probably my favorite which I'd probably stick to if I come back. Tender juicy cuts of beef head with a distinct smokiness that gives it just enough flavor. Of course, I still had to pack on the hot sauce and onions to give it some fire and texture. \n\nStop by at this foodie attraction when you're in town. If you're going with a group of people (which is probably the best strategy), come up with a game plan so you can get by with the least amount of time wasted. \n\nOh and don't forget to pay for your tacos like I did. After you get your food, take it to the front counter. It's all by honor system there.
