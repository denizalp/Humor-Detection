Sure, this Home Depot's probably the same as any other.  However, a few things to note that make this experience nice:\n\n-People greet you at the door and they can actually help you with what you need.  They usually don't have to refer you to three other people to find what you're looking for.\n\n-What was once the \"grill and coal oasis\" (my name) has now become the \"get the *@&*& out of your snow jam oasis.\"  Loads of shovels and car scrapers.  Ones that expand, ones that don't, mini ones, and so on.\n\n-The key guy is nice and competent.  When I had to wait a little while for my key to be copied (because I just happened to be there the one time 3 other people were waiting in line), he said, \"Thanks for being patient.\"\n\n-The self-check out is not frustrating as hell like it is at most grocery stores.  Plus it's almost always empty, so if you run into a problem or something's too big to scan, someone can help you out right away.\n\nIf I were a dude, I'm sure there'd be more to say.
