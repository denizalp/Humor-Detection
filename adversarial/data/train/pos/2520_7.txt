I have wanted to try this place the last couple of times that I have been to the Aria Hotel, but I just did not have the time to stop and get a few things.\n\n\nSo, today was the day I decided to check this place out.  As I walked in, the deserts were so beautifully presented that I just had to stop and drool.\n\nSo, finally after 10 minutes of carefully checking out each item, I decided to get the vanilla flan, tutti fruiti, chocolate intense, coconut macaroon and chocolate, coconut macaroon.\n\nThe vanilla flan was awesome, the vanilla flavor was intense and delicious.  The tutti fruitti is fiiled with a lemon mousse and topped with strawberries......very light and super tasty.  The chocolate intense is a chocoate covered chocolate mousse, topped with a chocolate macaroon....sooooo yummy.\n\nBottom line, if you enjoy awesome sweets, you must check this place out.
