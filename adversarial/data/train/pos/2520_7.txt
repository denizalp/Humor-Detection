In the past I spent  about $500.00 here a month.  One day upon entering the store heading toward the produce a \"produce person\" approached me and said  \n\" I like it wet \".  He made no other comments to me or anyone else.  This seemed very strange..  Whole Foods needs to re-instruct their employees to not annoy the customers unless they want to keep losing business.
