This hotel was really fancy smancy.   I would have loved to stay in the hotel longer but hey, I'M IN VEGAS!!!  You dont stay in your hotel for long if you're in Vegas.  \n\nThis hotel isn't an ordinary hotel.  This is for the people who have extended stays because there's a full kitchen, a washing machine plus dryer.  It's basically an apartment.   This place would be nice for a couple since there was a hot tub right next to the bed..*wink*..It's a very Nice! (Borat voice)
