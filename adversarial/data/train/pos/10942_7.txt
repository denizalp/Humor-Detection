This is one of the few places that has landed on my banned list, and that's a tough thing to achieve.  The sad part was it really had nothing to do with the food.  Taste wise, the food is okay for a fast food take out joint.\n\nI used to work nearby and had given this place many many chances.  The lunch service is very busy, but their service is just plain horrible.  3 or 4 times it took about 20+ minutes for me to step in and be able to walk out with my take out.  It's just not good enough for \"fast food\".\n\nBut what really did them in was that one time my order of Chicken Pad Thai that took 30 minutes (and I was in a rush) got 2 thin slivers of chicken.  I discovered it when I had gotten back to the office.\n\nThe next time I went, I told the server about my previous experience and continued to order the Chicken Pad Thai.   It still took a long time and I decided to inspect my meal.  I opened up my box  before I left  to to reveal a whopping 3 slivers of chicken.  I'm not sure about you, but I kinda expect more than 2 grams of protein in whatever dish I generally order.  I'm a man that needs my protein gosh darn it!!\n\nThe kicker was when I tried to bring this up to the cashier to show her, she replied with something like \"we're too busy sir, that is what the Pad Thai is like\" (in other words tough luck, your order is like a slot machine, suck it up).  \n\nBanned!
