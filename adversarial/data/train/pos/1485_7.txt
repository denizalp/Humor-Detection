Promoting positivity in the community, Burning Man artist Scott Cohen's Life Cube Project is live at Fremont and 9th Street in Downtown Las Vegas.  Until April 2nd, 2016, the community is invited to contribute to this interactive structure where local artists have already left their mark on the cube.  A 'Build and Burn' piece, the Life Cube will be burned down (in a controlled environment) on April 2nd.  People are encouraged to share their dreams, goals, and aspirations at the cube and we visited last night when it was illuminated for the first time.  There were artists, a DJ, spinning lights, and a crowd taking it all in as well as people writing, painting, and drawing on the two-story cube.  There was chalk and paint available for everyone's use.  A definite sight to see, get there and leave your mark.
