So today I went again for my First Attendance (see my first review for how and why). This isn't a 'court date' and there was no trial. \n\nI received the notice only after less than 2 weeks since my first visit. They told me to be there at 10:30am. \nDue to a malfunctioning alarm\/blackberry, I was late, around 10:35. \nYou meet the prosecutor in a small room at the end of the hall on the 2nd floor. Everyone there is for 10:30. She was calling out names, I suspect in alphabetical order, and I had already been called. \nLuckily, she went through the names a 2nd time. \n\nWhen called in, she states that I was in there for a speeding ticket. She asks me if I want to plead guilty, even at a reduced charge, that it will be on my record and I cannot plead not guilty anymore. \nShe said that we will plead for a lesser charge, and she'll put my speeding to be only 10 over the limit, not 20. \n\nThen she told me to wait at the other side of the hall. This whole thing from stepping in the room took less than a minute. \n\nYou wait, until called in, to the Intake Office. \nShe will call you in by name again. Here, you meet with a Judge. \n\nHe asks you what do you plead? Guilty. \nDo you understand all the consequences of pleading guilty? Yes. \nI will amend your certificate. Do you have anything you want to say?\n(apparently whatever I said, had no bearing between me and the guy before me, however, one girl before me - the door was open - mentioned she was unemployed and it seemed like he reduced the fine, and allowed her 60 days to pay it)\n\nThen that was it! My fine from $115 and 3 demerit points, go reduced to $30 and no demerit points, however it's still on my record. \n\nThey are sneaky because $30 really $45 ( $5 admin fee, and some $10 surcharge) .\n\nYou go back downstairs and wait in Priority with the other people to pay at the kiosks! Done. \n\nabout 30 mins.\n\nNote:  I also saw an excopper or someone that comes on your behalf to fight traffic tickets. He definitely wasn't a civilian, per say.  I'm thinking these are the people from that company that will fight your ticket for you for $10. They come through this process, especially for a simple one, and it's something that not many people know about.  I mean, the only thing you're really saving is the time off work. I'm just saying.
