This has been on my list for years as after I was disappointed by my trip to the one on 75th I was told this original one was no longer connected to the others and that it was better. I agree! We had a reservation for 7 and got there about 5 minutes early and were seated right away and the 3rd party at our table arrived shortly. On a busy night you might want to leave time to park further away if needed, we got the last spot in the lot they share with Black Bear diner. Service was spot on and everything flowed nicely the whole evening. The cook, while not the most entertaining fellow, was talkative and did an excellent job. The food was all well prepared. I had the filet\/shrimp combo. The pricing was in line with what I expected. The folks to our left said it was the only teppan table in the valley they would go to. I'm a bit more adventurous than that but there was definitely nothing I found lacking. I tend to give well run Teppan grills a round up because I like them. This will be the 3rd time I gave one a five (actually the first one was over 30 years ago). The other 2 are long gone so I hope this one sticks around.
