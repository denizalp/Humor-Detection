Wife and I went to the Peterson Events Center the other day for our sons 2018 graduation from high school.\nThis was the first time I was at the Peterson Center.\nI believe normally they have concerts there and the Panthers play there as well.\nIt is a big stadium with lots of seating.\nIt was a small graduation as there e where only 55 kids in the graduating class.\nThe Center was nice and the seats where pretty comfortable.\nOverall I was happy with venue.\nI would go there again if something came up
