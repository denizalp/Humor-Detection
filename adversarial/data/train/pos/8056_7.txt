My review is based on service. \n\nI was here today with 4 members of my family all received services, and I sat and watched.\n\nMy issue with service came with my niece. She was they only one who received a simple manicure ( Spa Manicure $15) . I felt as though she was treated with less regard because she was not getting gel polish or multiple services like everyone else.\n\nOnce her nails where cleaned and cut she was moved to the corner drying station were her nails were hastily done.\n\nMentioned my issue with this to my sister and the older gentlemen doing her nails told me it was because she was not getting gel.\n\nSo I asked him, if you don't get gel nail polish you don't have your nails painted at the tables like everyone else?\n\nHe replied \" let me explain, that's not true\"\n\nI said it should be a simple yes or no question\n\nIt was at this point he just walked away from the discussion speaking in his native tounge.\n\nI paid for the nails and the young one who rang me up noticed no tip was given and asked me \" is everything OK\"\n\nI said it's great, and I left.\n\nMoral of the story, don't treat your customers differently because they are not paying for the most expensive services. If I pay for a service you offer I expect to be treated like all the other clientele.
