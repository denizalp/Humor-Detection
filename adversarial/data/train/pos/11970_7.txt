I'm not sure if it's because we came late and it was almost closing but I thought the drinks here was OK but not great. I ordered the #32 which was the passionfruit lime with aloe vera and basil seeds. Honestly, I didnt taste any basil seeds at all. That was disappointing to me because I ordered the drinks for the basil seeds. I ordered a large size with 30% sugar and still, it was super sweet. Overall, in my opinion this place was decent. Waiting in line takes while too.
