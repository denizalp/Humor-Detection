Found this place through yelp with tons of awesome reviews and happy to say that Pizzeria Bianco did not disappoint! I'm a big fan of thin crust pizzas and this place might be one of the best. \n\nThe restaurant is pretty small but I loved the atmosphere of this place and the beautiful brick exterior of the restaurant was my favorite! We almost didn't come because we didn't want to have a long ridiculous wait, but I'm so glad we decided to come anyway. Luckily, we went there after the lunch rush around 2pm so we got seated in less than 10 minutes! \n\nThe service was great and the pizza was amaaaazingly delicious! We devoured our pizzas in silence cus it was that good hahaha. I'm actually craving it quite a bit as I am writing this review.... everything about the pizza was perfect! It was a 10\/10!! :D We got the Margherita and the Wiseguy pizza. The toppings were extremely fresh and I loved the smokiness of the crust from the wood-fired oven. Wish we got to try all the other signature pizzas as well. The pizzas are a bit pricey compared to the size, but I think it was worth it :)
