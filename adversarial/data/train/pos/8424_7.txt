I've been to Castle Casa Loma during the cold winter time in Toronto. It's definitely a different sight from what you would see in the summer time when there is no snow and you're not shivering walking though the underground stables; or going from one tower to the other tower trying to get a view of the city outside. You can also tour inside and see the history of Casa Loma as it's pretty much a museum. I have heard some movies were also shot there and lots of people book it for wedding. I did not do the tour as I'd rather do things at my pace and not have to listen to other people's story, but that's me. There's always the option for the guide here. The snow in the winter makes the castle look like a scene from the early 16th century. Definitely seemed much nicer in my opinion as it gives it some character and a certain vibe of how people would live in a stone castle during those time. Bring a good camera here since there are places with low lighting and you might need a soft flash.
