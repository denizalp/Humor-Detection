I usually end up spending a lot of time in casino sports books because of the anal rippage I receive from the Pai Gow dealers. \n\nI love this sports book's layout. Only four rows deep so even if you forget your glasses you get a great view from any seat. A great sports book to place your wager and relax. \n\nThree huge 16x12 broadcasting the most popular games, thirty six 60\" plasmas, twenty four 42\" plasmas, forty nine 15\" color TVs for race book wagerers.
