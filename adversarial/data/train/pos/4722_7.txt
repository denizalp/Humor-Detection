Interesting to watch as they make your order.  Three stations making orders and the staff work hard to make your rolled ice cream.  Ordered the Very Berry and Cherry.  Fresh ingredients and tasty ice cream.  It does take a while to make your order and luckily the line was short so our wait was not to long.  Definitely a good and interesting take on ice cream, but for $7 it is a little on the expensive side.
