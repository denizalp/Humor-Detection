The key here is \"handmade\" - hand pattied burgers, hand cut fries and hand made milkshakes. Everything is made to order.\n\nI was in a burger mood and BT's hit the spot. The 8 ounce burger was made of very tasty beef topped with my choice of toppings (I went with pepperjack cheese and bacon plus \"free\" toppings sauteed mushrooms, onions and lettuce, skipping the chili, jalapenos, pickles and relish) and a small fries. The food was brought out to my table quickly, where I was enjoyed one of their draft beer selections (Yuengling for $2.50!) The small fries were hot and there would be enough to share. (I missed that they also have sweet potato fries. Dang!)\n\nI opted not to go for the milkshake, but other people in the place were enjoying theirs. If there wasn't a Cold Stone Creamery right next door, I'd say that coming in just for the shake looks like fun.\n\nMusic playing softly in the background, plus two flatscreen TV's tuned in to ESPN. \n\nBT's also has chicken and salad offerings, as well as kid's meals. Check the website for the complete list.\n\nSummary: Enjoyable burger in a comfortable inexpensive restaurant. I'll be back.
