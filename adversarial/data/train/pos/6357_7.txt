Mochiko Chicken!\nThat's my go-to dish at this little shop on Durango owned and operated by Chef Tony, a one-man show.  He takes your orders and then cooks up the food, serving it to you hot and fresh.\nThe Mochiko Chicken is served with kung pao broccoli, peanuts, and white rice. The chicken itself has a slightly sweet crunch to it, Asian comfort food at its tastiest.  This bowl of goodness is my favorite thing on the menu here and I would probably have it every day if we lived closer.  Stop by the Rice Shop and try one of Chef Tony's flavorful dishes for yourselves.
