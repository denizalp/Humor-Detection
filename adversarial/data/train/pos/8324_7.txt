Where can I start ? Gosh this place deserves all the 5 stars. I went here with my boyfriend and i toughed it up and ordered the all you can eat meat. Gosh. We had a secret plan of not eating the salad or the bread because of course everyone says its a \"trick\" to make you full. Well...that plan did not go through. The bread was delicious. The salad was so good. The plantains were so orgasmic. \n\nThen here comes the meat! I got so excited my eyes glowed like Dumbos. I loved seeing the meat in a stick. Yum. I could never be a vegetarian. I ate everything until I went on a food coma. After eating at this place.....we took a nap for a couple hours. The adventure is totally worth it. \n\nI loved it and I will never forget it. Everything was so tasty. \n\nOrgasmic. \n\nI love SAMBA
