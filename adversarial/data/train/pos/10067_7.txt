Oh my goodness, The Montauk Happy Hour was absolutely incredible!!!!!! I'm already planning my next HH\/Dinner here... {and have sent foodie pics to my fam & friends!} \n\nFirst, I have to give MAJOR props to our waiter, Morgan. He was super attentive and made our girls' night one of the best yet! {He even brought us special pink \"mystery\" drinks!} \n\nHappy Hour is Monday - Friday from 3 PM - 6 PM \n\nTHE FOOD, oh my, HUGE portions and literally some of the the best food that I have had in a while. I highly recommend the house potato chips (MASSIVE BOWL for $3), Tuna Tartare Guacamole w\/wonton chips (This was my favorite!!), Burrata w\/fig, pistachio, prosciutto, arugula, truffle oil & grilled bread ...and last but certainly NOT least, the Mac 'N' Cheese add truffle oil. {Yes, i'm a truffle addict!}\n\nFor Drinks, they have $5 glasses of house wine, $17 bottles of house wine, $3 Beer & $5 well cocktails. \n\nSeriously dine here, you will leave just as happy as I did!! :) Can't wait to come back!!
