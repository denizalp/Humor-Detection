We're rapidly becoming regulars at Triple C. Why? I'm telling you why! Dang impatient teenagers.\n\nFirst and most importantly: the beer is good. I love all of Charlotte's local breweries, but every once in a while, one of their brews just doesn't quite hit the mark. This is to be expected; craft beer is an art form. However, so far, I haven't had a Triple C brew that I didn't like. They do a good job rotating in new and interesting beers as well.\n\nAnother bonus is the location. Triple C is in the middle of an industrial area, kind of tucked away off South Blvd. The interior is simple but beautiful and suited to their trade. It's just a cool vibe. They usually have a varied and entertaining crowd as well. You'll see groups of friends horsing around as well as people with laptops quietly clicking away.\n\nWe will keep returning to Triple C as long as they keep being awesome.\n\nPS Although they don't serve food, they often have a food truck parked outside.
