It's hard to find great food, quick service and availability near or before any sporting event but we scored on all three here at Whiskey Rose! \nFriendly greeters welcomed us and we were sat within 4 mins. \nThe food was really delicious and portions are huge. \nChef came out to check on us and our drinks were never empty. \nThis is a for sure better than most \" pre or post game stop\" 4 star review for WR
