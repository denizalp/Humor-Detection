This was on my place to try for a long time and finally had a chance to try here this week. They change menu frequently based on reviews, I knew some of them are always there and I wanted to try them.\n\nFirst thing I noticed about this restaurant was a rosemary they placed in the napkin and silverware set.  I immediately pulled out of the rosemary and enjoyed the nice scent of rosemary.\n\nTheir wine menu consist mainly California and Italy, but a few selections from other parts of the world. Since I wanted to have scallops for dinner, I chose a bottle of Spanish wine, which I somehow finished the bottle. Their wine menu was not extensive but they carry nice wines.\n\nTwo of the appetizers I read on others reviews here were Charred octopus and Asparagus, and naturally we ordered both. I always enjoy grilled octopus anywhere, in fact I never had bad grilled octopus. They serve their grilled octopus with chili butter. Chili butter was slightly spicy but when I ate with arugula and octopus together, bitterness of arugula and chili spice blended well with grilled octopus.  Grilled asparagus was also good, slightly runny fried duck egg, mixed with feta cheese, salty bacon, and foie gras hollandaise sauce all together, I cleaned the plate to get the last bit of the hollandise sauce with asparagus.\n\nFor dinner, I ordered scallops. I enjoyed my scallops but I enjoyed my friend's duck more.  Duck was cooked medium rare, it was so soft and tender...I almost wanted to say, can we switch?\n\nFor desert, I can't remember the name of my food but it was like chocolate mouse but not too sweet at all. I enjoyed my desert with macchiato.\n\nExcellent service, the place was slightly tiny and I heard some conversation from our neighbors (I wasn't listening but I heard them talk, they were on the first date ), It was that close together..  They have nice patio and would love to come back on warmer night.  Definitely foodie heaven here and highly recommend.
