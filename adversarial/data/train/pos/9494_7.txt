EDC has converted me to a hardcore raver! It's easy to say it is  complete!! I'm 33 years old so I wanted to experience a rave in my lifetime. Every 3-4 months I visit Vegas yet I always hear about EDC going on and just ignore it. Why have a wasted all these years of avoiding going to this mix of EDM with a lot of beautiful souls that religiously visit EDC Las Vegas once a year just for that. \n\nThank God I booked the Early Owl in November and then Premier Shuttle pass both with monthly installments. I didn't know much about EDM other than Kaskade, Armin Van Buuren, Tiesto, DeadMau5, Calvin Harris, Diplo and Marshmello. There's several stages big and small all around EDC but mostly stayed in Kinetic Field to watch Kaskade, Diplo and Marshmello. It feels great to dance to the rhythm of the music with no care in the world about the people around you. Most of the party goers were nice to me except for a few people who had a snarky attitude. \n\nFood options aren't cheap. A small can of beer was $11 and a mix cocktail was $15-$19 depending on the stand and why you ordered. The food in the stands were just, meh. Nothing specially really. The smoothie was ok, sushi burrito was fire! The food trucks served excellent food with ok prices. I liked the pork and rice from the Filipino food truck. Also the Korean bulgogi cheesesteak was out of this world! \n\n\nLet's not forget the Rainbow Bazaar with their interesting rave merchandise. My favorite part of the Rainbow Bazaar was the psychic store front. She knew what was going on and was on point yet kinda scary to know. Besides the music and shopping was the amusement park rides. Yeah, the lines were long but they steadily moved. It's nice to dance in like while listening to the music. Ahh....\n\nMinus one star because most places were, \"CASH ONLY!!!\" The Premier Shuttles were on point traveling from the hotel to EDC then from EDC to the hotel. They were always on time. All our shuttle drivers were friendly as well. It was nice that we got to ride through Nellis Air Force base as a shortcut to the venue. It was so worth paying extra for that. \n\nThe negative aspect of EDC would be the groups of people who only plan to go to EDC to steal other ravers wallets and phones. I mean, really! I've heard a lot of people got pick pocketed during live sets. Oh, let's not forget the people who wait by the entrance to scam people out of their hard earned money. Sometimes I just want to tell these people to get a ******* job!\n\nI can't wait for EDC 2019!! May 17-18-19
