I'd come back to this restaurant in a heart beat, for all the complaining I did in my other two reviews about food being over priced in the Mandalay Bay this place is totally worth it. Most the stuff that I had I don't know the actual name of since my friends ordered everything before I got to the restaurant but the Ribeye steak was great, there was some sort of wonton fish tacos that were fantastic, & best of all was this Tuna \"pizza\" I believe that I can't do justice by describing but it was one of the most amazing things I've ever eaten in my life.\n\nIf my next trip to Vegas happened to be all the way on the other side of the strip at the stratosphere I'd make it a point to come down to the Mandalay Bay just to have that pizza again.
