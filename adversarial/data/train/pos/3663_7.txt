It's been said before, but I'd be doing you a disservice if I didn't say it again...\n\n$5 Cocktail Wednesdays!\n\nThey're legit. Classics with a touch of Scopa flare. I'm totally in love.\n\nI think that Scopa is the kind of place that East Side Mario's or The Old Spaghetti Factory WISH they were. A friendly, neighbourhood atmosphere, but in the case of Scopa, some really bitchin' food! My friend Sabahat ordered this lamb shank that looked out of this world - like it had the most flavourful meaty crust and juiciest interior. I'm just guessing though, so you'll have to check out her review to confirm. (Official Yelper Callout!)\n\nI went with... well I went with a cocktail. And then I went with another cocktail... But when it came time for food I had a Pancetta Pizza: smoked pancetta, potato, cream sauce, roasted garlic, caramelized onion, roasted chillies for $17. I loved the ingredients used but for some reason, this time at least, it was so incredibly greasy. I don't so what it's usually like, but I know it's definitely not like this - our server came over and told us that the pizza would be comped. This really made our experience wonderful and I can't wait to come back. That said, if it wasn't soggy right through with grease, it would have been so damn good! I cant wait to go back and try more
