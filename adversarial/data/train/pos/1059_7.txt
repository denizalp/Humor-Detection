Yes. I am shameless... I will admit to owning a pair of terry sweats that say \"juicy\" across my heinie. But I do NOT wear them outside of the house. Juicy occasionally will come up with some cute tops and dresses. I gleefully flounced my way in as gracefully as I could in the excruciating heat. Grabbed some stuff to try and the sheer idea of looking at a dressing room line of 15 deep just turned me off. Alas... another store for me to visit when its in the dead of winter in Vegas.
