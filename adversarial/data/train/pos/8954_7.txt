They call this a bar? I think these reviewers are paid off. Nobody has mentioned that they don't have kegs or beer on tap. That's right, a bar that serves bottles only.\n\nOnce I heard that, I should of just left, but I stuck in there. I ordered a bucket of coronas, which you get 5 of. Happy hour it's 2.50 a piece, now I went on a Saturday night around 8pm. $20 bucks for 5 12 oz bottles. Now my mistake for not asking the price, but in my bar experiences, I never paid 20 bucks for 5 bottles. I also ordered 2 starry night shots, they cost me $6 bucks a piece. $6 bucks for a shot are you freaking kidding me!\n\nIt was my brothers birthday, that's why I didn't ask about prices, I thought it would be reasonable based on the reviews here. They even charged me for the $1 bday shot the bartender gave my brother. We didn't even ask for it. So as you can see I am pretty pissed about the whole experience. Also it was quite dead for it being a saturday night, but I don't blame people not coming there. Next time I'll stick to my regular spots.\n\n$36 bucks got me: 5 coronas, 2 shots of starry night and a birthday shot out of a plunger (that's right, a toilet plunger)
