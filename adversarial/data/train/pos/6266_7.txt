I had a coupon to try this place a few weeks ago, and I had a great experience... Laura did my eyebrows and she did a fantastic job.  She was sweet as can be and professional too.  They offer other kinds of waxing here also.  I made an appointment ahead of time, but I think they are pretty good about walk-ins and last minute appointments also.  The Brow Lady is located in a convenient location and it's small and comfortable inside.  I'll be back to see Laura again soon for sure!\n\nInteresting history of 'The Brow Lady' also... read about it at:  http:\/\/thebrowladyusa.com\/The_Brow_Lady.html  This is the kind of local business that makes you feel good to support!
