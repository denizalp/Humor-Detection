Been here twice. Not a fan. First time was good. Had the 2 slice pizza and drink combo for $4.00\n\nTonight we had pizza and wings. Wings are super hot, for medium. Not too happy about that. Although they did offer after awhile of seein my daughters mouth on fire to tame them down. But then they came back cold. $45 plus for so so food. No thanks. \n\nGood for lunch combos - that's about it. Sucks because I'm all about supporting independent business owners.
