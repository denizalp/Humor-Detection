When I travel I know I'm going to eat like a total piggy so I try as much as possible to eat healthy during the daytime. We picked up breakfast from Farm & Craft and I got a hearty steak & quinoa bean bowl. It was so much food that it probably works have lasted me three meals if I had a fridge to store my leftovers.
