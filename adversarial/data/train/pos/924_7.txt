This place is huge! My fiancé was part of a car show and we came here to see a drifting show. \n\nNote to everyone:\n* bring earplugs\n* food is overpriced \n* bathrooms are far or portapotties \n* parking is a bitch\n* my fiancé And I could not find the exit to this place for the life of us\n\nOverall: fun show but really unorganized place
