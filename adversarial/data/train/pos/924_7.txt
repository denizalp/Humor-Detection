I want to say nice things about this place but there is NO EXCUSE why I should have had to pay rent when I could not even take a comfortable shower. They gave me excuses about how the hot water was uncontrollable and kept trying to imply it was my own fault that I couldn't get the temperature right. They were difficult and rude at times and lied on several occasions. The arms did go off a lot and there was a leaf blower early int he morning all the time to wake me up. When I moved in, they gave me an apartment with a lot of really bad carpet stains which pissed me off. They claimed they would correct it and never would. Also, the tub was nasty and needed to be resurfaced which they promised and never did. When you leave, they tack on  A LOT of fees.
