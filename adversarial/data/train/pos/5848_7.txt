I loved this place!!! I don't give many places 5 stars but here it is! \n\nI came here with my work crew, because one of my co workers was leaving the company. My bosses reserved the Captain's Room. Ok, if you ever have a group of 10 or more, reserve this room! It's great! It's your own private room, with a dining room table, lounge area, two tvs, fireplace, and pool table. The best part about this restaurant is that it is right on the lake so you have a beautiful view while you eat here. The outdoor patio is also very nice. They laid down some grass and have some tables out there as well as corn hole, and darts for you to play. \n\nFood & drinks.. They have happy hour from 3-6 I believe. We ended up ordering the nachos, coconut shrimp, green chile cheese fries. My favorite was probably the cheese fries. There's a kick to it but it's really good. For drinks, my bosses spoil us. We ordered 4 bottles of wine! I'm a red wine drinker and my favorite is Pinot Noir. It was really good as well as the Cabernet that they had. \n\nThis place is really new so I don't think many people know about it. I think the inside needs some more interior designing and they need a huge sign outside that says The Watershed on it. Also, I would recommend extending the happy hour menu to 7 instead. The service was amazing as well. I need to start taking down servers' names when I go out because I never remember and ours was great! He was extremely friendly and very helpful with our group. I'll definitely be back soon! =)
