I concur with most others who have rated this school low.  I think they give out good grades a little too easily.  There are some classes that I struggled through and got lower grades but the second two years of working toward my BS in Criminal Justice I got all A's.  Don't get me wrong, I worked my tail off to get those good grades but some others didn't work nearly as hard and also got good grades.  I got lucky for the most part when working in teams.  Most of us were in all classes together so when I found others I worked well with and knew they were working just as hard as me, we requested to be in the same group for each class.  After I got my Bachelor's I decided to go to another online school for my Masters and I switched to Boston University.  They have a stringent acceptance policy so they do not let just anyone in.  Because I had no work experience in my particular program, I was on probation for my first 3 classes.  I couldn't get anything less than a B or I'd be dropped.  So I worked extra hard.  After my probationary period was over, I managed all A's and B's except one class in which I got C- and had to not only take it over, but pay for it.  The school is VERY expensive, more so than UoP, but I know I got a top notch education and I know employers will look more favorably on my choice of graduate school.  So if you want a good education at a reputable school, don't choose UoP.
