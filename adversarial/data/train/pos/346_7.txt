This place is a joke. Let's start with paying for expedited entry and then waiting an hour and a half to get to the entrance. There's nothing expedited about that. \n\nWe bought tickets for DJ Snake (5\/26) and once we got to the entrance, found out he had cancelled. Highly disappointing as he was to be one of the highlights of our trip.\n\nEncore should be embarrassed.
