I liked this place from the time I hit the door. Actually, before. While dropping my car off with valet, he let me know there was an hour and a half wait. I had reservations, but it was smart to inform me to save everyone time.\n\nDespite having reservations, the wait was still longer than anticipated. I was here for a birthday party and decor was provided, which the restaurant gave no fuss about putting out in the manner prescribed by the birthday dinner hostess. The only issue with service is they kept calling us \"sweetie\". A little petty, but this is not okay. \n\nThe downside was food. I had nachos and they were luke warm. So were the fried oysters on my friend's salad. Aside from mussels, nothing was particularly tasty. Much room for improvement with food.\n\nThe best part of Ink N Ivy were the intangibles. It has an overall good vibe. The venue is VERY large. Great place for a big party. There was a also a mixed crowd, old... young... all races & religions. Background music was a upbeat pop from the 99 and the 2000s. I would come back by here to hang out. It surely is an amazing happy hour spot. If you're starving, choose elsewhere. If you're ready to be social, Ink n Ivy is the way to go.
