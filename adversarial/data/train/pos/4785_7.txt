I personally only come here for the nachos, so I can't judge anything else other than that. \n\nThe nachos is a HUGE plate and can definitely feed 2-3 people all while enjoying the nice sports bar atmosphere. I usually get the steak and BBQ chicken on it and it is FABULOUS!\n\nThe nachos are crisp and the cheese is too die for. The servers can be late with drinks at times, but they're overall friendly and worth the 30 minute drive. \n\nSo if you've never been here before, trust me; get the nachos.
