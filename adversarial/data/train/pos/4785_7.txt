I ordered Mongolian beef. I've honestly had better, but it was good and the portion for $5.25 was huge!! There were lots of huge chunks of tender beef. I was surprised at how much meat they put in this $5.25 meal!!\n\nI really liked their crab puffs and I NEVER eat crab puffs because I find them boring. I usually give them to my hubby, because hubby will eat almost any crab puff, good or bad. These had amazing flavor (the filling) and were cooked perfectly.\n\nCONTRARY to what Sara D says, this place feels clean. It actually is a nice place, kind of upscale for the price!! It's not just a hole in the wall, as would be typical when you pay only $5.25 for a lunch combo!! \n\nI'll go back and order something different. I'd order the Mongolian beef again, but I look forward to checking out the other dishes too!!\n\nI think it would be helpful for their business if they put their menu online somehow. I probably would have tried them out sooner if I could have checked out their menu long ago. Also, I wish they would have offered up some sweet and sour sauce for the crab puffs. They would have been even better!\n\nSee you soon, Bamboo Cafe.
