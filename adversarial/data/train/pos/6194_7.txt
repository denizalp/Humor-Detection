Step through the spinning carousel glass and back in time as you descend the Kimpton lobby stairs and find yourself in Western Pennsylvanian opulence. \n\nSteel beams hang heavily in this large space, a dark reminder of the rough-necked workers that built this city from the smelting blast furnaces of then to the glimmering metropolis you are ordering breakfast in today. Exposed bulbs hang precariously above the dining area, threatening to fall into your pork belly hash and ignite the entire section.\n\nService, rendered by beautiful paragons, is efficient and friendly - we're all on the same group chat now! There is a Bloody Mary bar for the discerning and creative types who wish to mix their own disgusting V8 concoction. I prefer an orange juice with apple cider vinegar. \n\nEvery detail of this hotel restaurant is addressed with intentionality and a sense of duty to represent the brand identity but also, and more importantly, the city. If you want to compare blouse ruffles with the West Penn bourgeoisie, go somewhere else. If you want to dine well with the proletariat, run - DON'T WALK - to The Commoner.
