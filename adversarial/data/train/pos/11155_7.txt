So not my first time here but this my first time going full out. Probably ordered too much food but who cares! Yolo for my belleh!! Anyhow taco salad was huge and awesome ... The bowl was crispy and so yummy... The bean soup side is great! (Awesome for hangovers too , I've had it here after a long night), cilantro rice as good as well..... Rice And cilantro can be together heh. My chorizo tacos were very very good and now they have Dos Equis on tap now so enjoying a pint or 2 or 3 with this fine meal. Good way to spend you Friday night. Make reservations though, this place is a hot spot in Newmarket so prepare to be in a loud and excited atmosphere but even though noisy its pleasant environment... Just got handed a random bean taquito..... Also good. I'm starting to think that I should have used paragraphs to break up this review and also maybe I should have not been drinking while food blogging . or maybe that's EXACTLY what I should have been doing! Eat Here. Its good stuff!
