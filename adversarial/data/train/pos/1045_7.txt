Not sure about heart and soul but it was definitely a solid meal.  One thing I really like about this place is the artwork and decor.  They also have outdoor seating on the sidewalk.  I got the beef ribs and dark meat chicken.  Yes it's a lot of food assholes.  And yes I finished it (most of it) but this is 2 hours after having a breakfast buffet at the hotel.  Sides were delish.  I got the yams and okra\/tomatoes.
