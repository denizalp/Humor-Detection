Disclaimer:  This will be a somewhat biased review because I absolutely LOVE Arthur Treacher's fish.  And I'm completely swimming in nostalgia...\n\nI had noticed over the last few years that all of the AT locations that I knew about had disappeared.  I assumed they were all gone and felt guilty that I hadn't frequented them enough to help keep them going.  A few months ago an article appeared talking about this particular location.  After putting it off (for what reasons, I'm not sure) for too long, my mom and I made the short trip to this Arthur Treacher's.  I think that I had visited here years ago because I remember the building.  When we walked in, we were flooded with memories, especially because I know that the older gentleman (owner?) working there worked at either the Euclid or Mayfield location previously.\n\nThe place is definitely dated and not the absolute cleanest (though I think they're doing the best they can with the constant frying of DELICIOUS fish).  The food was perfect.  Perfect flavor and the exact taste as it's always been.  The first hush puppies many of us ever had and other restaurants try to replicate were crispy on the outside and moist and flavorful in the inside.  The chips could've been a touch hotter, but were so good with the vinegar sprinkled on.  My mom and I had such a yummy and fun lunch talking about family meals at our hometown Arthur Treacher's all those years ago.\n\nI've had lots of different fish, but Arthur Treacher's will always be my first and best fish love.  Thank you for keeping this treasure afloat!
