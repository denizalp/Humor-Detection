A delicious thick and creamy treat.  If you love a real milk shake full of rich ice cream, dessert or some good candy, this is a great treat.  So nice to have this option in downtowns sea of buildings with somewhat limited options.  Had the Black Raspberry, a wonderful treat.  The shake is $5, so a tad on the expensive side, especially since Hello B is over $1 less and only one block away (though it has fewer flavor options).
