When I think of Las Vegas, I think of the strip... and I think of fun.  I've had my fair share of trips to the LV strip hotels.  I've stayed at TI, Caesar's Palace, Mandalay Bay, Bellagio, and Venetian.  And I have no complaints about any of them.  But last week, I saw a new side of Las Vegas... \n\nI stayed at the Golden Nugget, and this place blew my expectations away!  I may even have a new favorite place to stay in Las Vegas from now on... from the bell men and reception to the maids, everyone was friendly at this place.  And the accommodations were awesome.  I had a huge room in the Gold Tower.  For $89 per night, I was a VIP.  Unlimited bottles of water were stocked on my floor, apples throughout the day, snacks in the afternoon, coffee in the morning.  An extremely comfortable bed, nice amenities in the bathroom, and access to the fitness room was included in that rate.\n\nThe only things that I missed were easy access to a diet coke (no mini bar in the room or vending machine on the floor), and one of the days, I was missing shampoo.  \n\nIf you stay at the Nugget, go for the Gold (or the new Rush Tower I gather in reading the other reviews).  I was in town for a quick yelpy work visit, so I didn't get a chance to explore the shark pool or casino, but there is always next time.  And there will be a next time, Golden Nugget, and hopefully real soon!
