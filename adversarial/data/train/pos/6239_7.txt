EOS makes it damn near impossible to cancel your account. I sent an email AND a text message to the sales rep about cancelling my account in February, BEFORE the place was even open. \n\nThe sales rep (Antonio) told me in November (when I signed up), that I could cancel ANY time and get a refund, if I was not happy. \n\nThat was a lie. \n\nThey recently sent my account to collections and are telling me that I owe for April & May, yet I cancelled my account in February? I have NEVER stepped foot in the place, and refuse to. \n\nI would recommend getting a membership at Yak's Fitness (Durango & Warm Springs) or LVAC or somewhere else. Anywhere else is better than this place.
