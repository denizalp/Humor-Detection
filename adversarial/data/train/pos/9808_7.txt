I'm only giving this 2 stars (instead of one) because at least they DO offer gluten-free (GF) options.  However, GF bread is 75 cents extra.  Come on--GF bread isn't THAT much more expensive than regular bread.  As is common with GF dishes in restaurants, the portions are smaller...for more $$.  The GF caprese sandwich was small.  I haven't seen the \"regular\" caprese, but I suspect it's much bigger than this.  I asked for slaw as my side, and got a portion about 1\/4-1\/2 cup size.  Really?  How expensive is cabbage?   Oh yeah...it's not.  This meal looked tiny on the plate.  When I was done,  I realized, wasn't there supposed to be pesto on this sandwich?\n\nI ordered a hard cider with this, and the bill came to $18, including tip!  For an appetizer-sized meal?  An hour after I got home, I was hungry again, and I'm a woman (and not a big woman)--it doesn't take a lot of food to fill me up.  Will I go back to the Harp?  Only if someone treats me--I'm not handing over any more of my money.
