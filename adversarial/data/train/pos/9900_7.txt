What! I've found my favourite sushi take-out spot in Mississauga. Hands down. \n\nBased on all the Yelp reviews, we called in on a Friday evening to order for pick-up - we weren't too hungry and just wanted to sample a small batch of their sushi first (you know, before going all out and gorging on a huge order of takeout sushi that may or may not be that great). So we ordered two rolls to try since we were in the area - the Spicy Salmon Roll and the Vegetable Tempura Roll (8 pieces under $6.00). \n\nService was sweet, helpful, friendly. Our order was ready and waiting when we arrived - when they say 10 minutes, they mean it. The sushi itself was so delicious - I definitely recommend the Spicy Salmon roll. Great textures, very fresh, wonderful flavours (I love the crunch and hints of sesame throughout the roll). \n\nLike others have mentioned, note that seating is super limited (like 5 stools) - so unless you're a couple or eating in alone, it's probably best to order take-out. Also note that there's ample parking, as it's located in a large plaza (beside the new Terra Foodmart just east of Dundas and Winston Churchill).\n\nFor two rolls, we paid around $11.00. We will definitely be back to try out the rest of their menu.
