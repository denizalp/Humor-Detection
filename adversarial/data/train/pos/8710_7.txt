This place is amazing.  We had reservations for a Friday night and we were seated immediately upon arriving.  The waitress was really nice and friendly and gave us complimentary shots of something delicious... maybe it had rhubarb in it??  Our drinks were great, and the food is some of the best in the Madison area.  We had a mushroom (I think they were morels?) appetizer that was perfectly balanced with the light flaky pastry and delicious sauce.  Then we had the bacon wrapped fig appetizer and I thought I had died and gone to heaven.  Seriously, you need to order this, you will be so happy you did.  It was complex and a little bit goes a long way, but the flavors explode in your mouth.  We had the lamb dinner, and again, top notch.  Then we had the two creme brulee desserts - my husband had the brown sugar and I had the dark chocolate.  He liked his better and I liked mine better, so I'm not sure there was a clear winner, but we were both so happy with our choice.  The cool creamy custard with the hot crispy sugared top... yum.   This is going to be my go-to restaurant for birthday dinners, anniversary dinners, and any time I get to choose where we eat!
