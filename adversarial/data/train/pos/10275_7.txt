Ok ok ok so the telephone skills in terms of customer service could use some improvement, but the sushi is fresh, fast and is served in generous portions. \nI took a serving platter that I had over to their stop in shop, ask them which combo would be best and left it in their good hands. For $72, the price of a large combo platter, we got a centerpiece for our appetizer station. Not a single pice was leftover.\nNow, go pick up some take out and enjoy
