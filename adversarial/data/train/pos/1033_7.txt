Yum! Happy to have these guys in the neighborhood and even happier to know they're open on Wednesdays (cough cough Le's). The lady at the counter was super friendly and thoroughly explained the menu to us. I got the #4, grilled pork, and was super happy with it! Glad to see folks who are so passionate about what they create!
