Yup it's me again.....the person without the picture whos' opinion you might not be abale to trust but I will give my opinion anyway....after reading all the rave reviews on... Pizza Pizza Yelp about it.....I had to give Pizza Metro a try.....it was absolutely wonderful...who knew...certainly not me.\n\nWe made a reservation although on a Tuesday not needed but we were told that it is a good idea for Thursday, Friday and Saturday. We took our own wine (only a $5.00 corking fee).....The owner and his manager Michael were VERY friendly and went out of their way to make sure that we were taken care. They brought us a plate of flat bread with a mix of capers, onions, eggplant that was very yummy (sorry to you pleople that it tasted like tap water...I have to disagree).....we then shared a ceasar salad again more than enough for two....we had such a hard time deciding on entrees that we wound up splitting the lasagna and a meatball pizza (not really meatballs but rather homemade sausage)....all of it was out of this world and the lasagna was probably the best I have ever had....the pizza was wood fired with the perfect amount of topping....all homemade. All in all a great dinner leaving us comfortable full but not miserable....it will become one of our haunts and we are looking forward to trying their new restaurant \"Amarone\" which we have been told will have a full bar and a larger establishment and a little more upscale.....Thanks to all who wrote their reviews and made us curious enough to give it a try...\n\nP.S.....TOTAL BILL ONLY $32.00...and they are working on their liquor license which they hope to have in a few weeks
