Mmmm ok. I haven't been here in a looong time. Last time I was here they were in the old location. It's been about a year or so.\n\nWe were seated, asked what we wanted to drink and then our order was taken after we got our drinks.\n\nI don't know what happened to my server. It's like she forgot that we are here. Yeah, I'm literally typing this out as I'm eating (or trying to, at least). Anyway, I asked one dude if I could order with him. He said, \"Ummmmm, I can get your server for you.\" And promptly walked away. I think he forgot because he went into the kitchen. Oh maybe he went to find our server in the kitchen? Maybe... We waited... Ten minutes, no one to take our order and no food on the table... Had to get the attention of THREE people just to have our order taken.\n\nI don't remember the service here being so utterly dreadful. In fact, one of the reasons I used to love this place was because of how awesome the service was.\n\nYou changed bro.\n\nBut hey, at least the sushi is still pretty decent. Even so, the sushi doesn't make up for the complete lack of attention and awareness by the servers.\n\nNot sure what the infrastructure is like here so I won't go too hard but there needs to be some improvements. It's Thursday night and there's 7 groups with each group ranging from 1-4 people. It is FAR from busy. I see six employees walking around. I think 3 are servers and 3 are bussers maybe? Somethings up... I don't know what it could be. Maybe it's just not a good day? I really want to give the benefit of the doubt because I really loved this place in the past. \n\nYou know, I used to be a server for two different high volume restaurants. The biggest issue preventing restaurants from running smoothly is employees with disgustingly poor work ethic. If you've ever worked in the service industry, you know what I'm talking about. It's not just  the service industry. It's everywhere. \n\nAnyway... I'm having fun typing this out so I'll end with this. Rating the employees.\n\nOur server, Korean girl, speaks Korean well - 1\/5 (not very attentive, absolutely no customer service skills, needs most training) \n\nBusser guy - 2\/5 (I don't hate him, seems like a nice guy but I get the vibe he is new) \n\nLatina food runner - 3\/5 (she was very nice and probably new)\n\nGirl with tats - She did stop by to pick up plates and fill water and I like her tattoos so I'll give her a 3.5\/5. \n\nPatrita - OK. This is actually a turning point. She kind of just came out of no where and started helping us. She went to check on our food. Apologized profusely when it turned out the order was never put in. And has just been very attentive. Even though I'm about done with my meal, I'm glad that at least there's someone willing to take initiative. AND SHE IS PREGNANT. Good on her. 5\/5\n\nShort bald guy who I assume is owner aka kkomalul. He was nice enough. Doing his own thing most of the time. Neutral. \n\nAnyway, I'm done now. With my food, that is. I am not sure if I'll ever come back but if I do, its not likely to be my decision.\n\nEdit: One more thing... There was a slow and steady flow of people coming in and going out. You will not be greeted, you will not be thanked. At least not by their own volition. Being a server is a fairly straightforward job. However, I wholly believe that training is required. Regardless of your background. Every restaurant is run differently. Every employee should be trained to maintain a customer service mindset. 100% not something that was evident here. Other than from Patrita.\n\nI may have just come on a bad night. I don't know. I do know that I really did not enjoy my time here tonight, overall.\n\nI rarely do real-time reviews but I had a feeling it was going to be necessary.\n\nCheers.
