After popping into this place to get a couple iced Americano's, I left feeling cheated and over-charged.  The gal was sweet, but she had no idea what an Americano was.  I had to tell her how to make it.  How do you have an espresso machine and serve Counter Culture coffee and not know what an Americano is?  This is a management issue.  Also, she ended up charging me for each shot she put in the drinks.  I walked out having paid almost $14 for two iced Americanos.  I can get two iced Americanos (Counter Culture) at Dean and Deluca for $8...and I don't have to tell them how to make the drink.\n\nI'd love to go back and try their food, but after this experience it might be impossible on principle alone.
