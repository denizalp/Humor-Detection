I have to start out by saying that I am SO excited to have this awesome new dive{ish} bar in the Arcadia\/Phoenix community! We were definitely in need of another great, casual spot to go! It is SO cozy, a fun place to watch sports, meet friends late afternoon or night, indulge in DELICIOUS eats by The Stand's newest concept, and the reality is, The Bar is just an all around win! \n\nI enjoyed an order of their sliders which are absolutely incredible. Guys, i'm talking melt-in-your-mouth status! I can't even drive by without my mouth beginning to salivate at the thought of their deliciousness. But I mean, they're made by The Stand so duh, of course they're going to knock it out of the park! The fries are also phenomenal - I didn't want them to stop! I had a refreshing glass of chardonnay with my sliders and definitely left a happy camper. I loved the overall energy and feel of the bar. \n\nLucky me, The Bar is biking distance from my house so you better believe that we'll be regulars at this new neighborhood spot! Definitely pay them a visit, you won't be disappointed!
