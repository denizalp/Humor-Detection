The customer service was great but the doughnuts are horrible! Gross, small, nasty oil taste with flavor on top to cover up a Cminus doughnut. Then served too hot that it took me 5 minutes before I could eat it.\nIf you are going to be in the doughnut business, at least be good at the old fashioned.\nI'll stick with Northern Perks and Welcome doughnuts.
