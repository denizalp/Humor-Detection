I came in with a corvette(which is a low car but not scraping the road) and he needed to put the car on the lift but was unable to. Ive taken my car in other places and they have lifted my car up before.  What kind of mechanic cant figure out how to lift a low car?  Hes never had a low car come in?  I suggested laying something under the tires to give it a bit more room but he said ' i have nothing to use'.  Thats lame. If this is a sign of his problem solving skills then im glad he didnt touch my car.  Go elsewhere if u want a mechanic that actually wants to work on cars or shows any initiative.
