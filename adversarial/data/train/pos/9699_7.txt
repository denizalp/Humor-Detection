Pros: \nThe room was cheap \nI wasn't sexually assaulted \nI didn't get food poisoning \nThey never tried to throw me out \n\nCons: \nCrappy bars \nThe room smelled kind of funny \nAffliction t-shirts \n\nOverall I think it was a pretty positive experience. When I go to Vegas I try to not get stabbed and make my flight home, I accomplished both on my last trip. \n\nKeeping in mind that this hotel is on the lower end of the pricing spectrum I think is is pretty decent. I just wish they had better food and drink inside the hotel but that can be rectified by going to any of the adjacent casinos.
