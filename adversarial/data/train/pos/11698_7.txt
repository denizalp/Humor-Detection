I was always intimidated to go into this place at lunch and now that I've recently been on the prowl for delicious soups in the area, it's forcing me to man up. I've yet to conquer this place, soup-wise but I did manage to confront the legend of the their famous chocolate chip cookies (I use the term \"cookie\" loosely).\n\nThis mammoth cookie is a little more than an inch thick and had the rough circumference of my face. I had to eat it in 5 Acts like a Shakespearean tragedy. \n\nBut did it taste good? *sigh* It did. Perfectly buttery and the right kind of cookie crumbly FULL of chocolate chips.\n\nAnd here's where it fails and it's the same reason why I'm reluctant to bake face-sized cookies at home: Because it's so big, to get it baked perfectly through the center, you'll have to sacrifice the edges which were crispier than I like my cookies. Quality over size, people! Quality over size.\n\nLe Gourmand may be building a following for their Chocolate Chip Cookie but the true winner of their baked goods is the  Dark Chocolate Ganache Filled Ball of Sinful Heaven (patent on name pending). Talk about quality over size, this dome of chocolatey goodness is ready to burst with quality... and chocolate! My goodness...
