Was just browsing on Yelp for some affordable eatery and saw Fuku. We decided to pay a visit and it definitely reached our expectation. The burgers looked fulfilling-ly appetizing. I ordered a Tamago with some jazz fries. The dripping yolk in Tamago is the ish. Then the cute cashier suggested adding Sriracha to the burger... and my goodness. You have to eat the jazz fries quicklythough; otherwise they'd get soggy. Cute cashier and good food? No complaints here.
