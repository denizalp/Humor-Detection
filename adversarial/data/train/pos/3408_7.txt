Great for lunch, great for happy hour.  Probably even better when its not 114 degrees outside, since they have roll-up walls that will really open up the area when the mercury is more accommodating.\n\nLoved the half-sandwich\/salad lunch combo.  Their strawberry spinach salad is worth coming back for, and the paninis are manly enough for my lunch bunch, since they're packing baby swiss, roasted red pepper, and bacon horseradish spread.\n\nTheir happy hour specials are great, with $5 sangria's and $2.50 drafts.  That's right Spanky, come get your PBR on!
