Banjara, the jewel of crusty pits.  \n\nI'm not sure if it's just me, but one of the drawbacks to Indian food is that unless it's a buffet you don't really get to try a lot of dishes.  This problem is solved at Banjara, which offers combinations plates!  I had the Chicken Tikka Masala combo ($12.95) and everything was amazing!\n\nService was cheerful and quick and the restaurant has an upscale feel to it without being expensive.  This place is a great value!\n\nThe only slight drawback - the washroom wasn't really as clean as it should have been.   Hopefully the next few hours will go well and this review won't need any updating... :P
