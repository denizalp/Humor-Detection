Sorta bullshit restaurant. The food was not impressive and the service was poor. Things delivered to wrong tables, rudely correcting how to pronounce spanish words, just generally annoying. \n\nAlso, I ordered a chicken sandwich which was served cold. I asked \"this is supposed be cold, right?\" \"Yes\" But there were grill marks on the bread. \"When did you toast the bread?\" \"Earlier today, then we put it together when you order it\". Old toast. Cool.\n\nI loved the design and layout of the interior, though.
