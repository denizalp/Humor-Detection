Every bite really is better than the last.\n\nThis food truck born, turned brick and mortar sandwich spot is one of my favorites. A few staples with a seasonal rotation of fresh bites, they make sandwiches that I won't say no to. The service is always top-notch. My recent visit even had me being served by one of the partners for this business. I love that. \n\nThe storefront is tucked away off the hustle and bustle of downtown, but people find their way. I always manage to beat the crowds when I come, (lucky me) but I know my luck won't last. They always draw a crowd. \n\nThe Reuben-ish is my tried and true favorite. I love the Egg-salad and most recently the RU Chicken. I'm blown away by how they squeeze so much flavor between two slices of bread. \n\nTheir sides are a bit pricey, especially for the size, so that's the only thing I won't stand behind. That's okay though, I came for the sandwiches.
