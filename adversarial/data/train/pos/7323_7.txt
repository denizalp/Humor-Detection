I usually come with family for late night dinner. \n\nPros: the seafood, the maggi sauce lobster is really good, eel rice that needs to be ordered in advance usually, golden pumpkin and bitter melon, smoke duck breast and they have live shrimp if you want to try something a bit different. \n\nCons: Service is not so good, helps if the waiters and waitresses know you. Some of the more popular foods run out. \n\nOverall I like this place, seafood is at a reasonable price and prepared well.
