Luckily, Kevin H. put this place on my radar and actually took me there a few weeks ago.  I've been back a couple times now as it is dangerously close to home and so delicious.  \n\nThe cilantro salsa is perfectly awesome.  Your taste buds will love you.\n\nThe veggie tacos are everything I could ever ask for- I don't miss meat when I eat them and that is awesome sauce.  The beans are probably loaded up with things a vegetarian shouldn't be eating, but lets pretend that isn't the case and just enjoy them.\n\nService is kind of odd, but I really don't care because the food is amazing.  Go- go, now.
