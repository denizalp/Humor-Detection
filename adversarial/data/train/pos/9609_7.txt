Right off of Yonge street and very close to Finch station, if you feel like going to a hookah lounge - this isn't a bad place.\n\nIt's not really much of a lounge setting, more of a small restaurant and they bring the hookah to you.\n\nThe day I went, the fire alarm kept ringing. I assumed the owner would come over and apologize or reassure my friend and I that there were no problems... However, it just kept ringing the whole time we were there.\n\nThere isn't really anything special about the place and it's really small in size.\n\n3\/5
