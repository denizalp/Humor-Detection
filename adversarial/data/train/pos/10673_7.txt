Yes the wait is long! But hey, waiting for the best is worth it! Just bring a book or smart phone, and the time flies by.\nI love Dr Kang. Ha, I want to squeeze him so tight, he's so handsome, smart and intelligent! He gave me the best right hip ever! Now he's going to do the left hip. I'm so grateful and heart-felt. I trust him and feel safe! Thank you Dr Kang, you have changed my life forever. I will make you proud! Dance on Baby!\n\nhttp:\/\/www.gofundme.com\/iy2g3s
