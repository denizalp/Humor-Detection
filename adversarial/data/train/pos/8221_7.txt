One of my best friends that I have known since middle school is now Al Bundy: Married With Children. He wanted to meet up for a couple of beers over Thanksgiving weekend. We came up here to the Plank Road Tavern. This building housed the former Riveria Paninis. There was always a good fight there. Many Lakewood kids earned their stripes fighting adults outside of Paninis. That was back in the mid 90's when I first started drinking. I thought Paninis sandwiches tasted good back then. Plank Road Tavern has a solid beer list. They carried one of my favorite breweries: 3 Floyds Brewing Company. They have the Gumballhead on draft and it is a decent beer. The name of this bar is also nostalgic. Plank Road Brewery made Red Dog and Icehouse beers. I thought they were good when I was in high school because they looked different. I had a Red Dog poster in my room. Reminds me of the Minnie Ripperton classic Back Down Memory Lane: \n\nI stumbled on this photograph \nIt kinda made me laugh \nIt took me way back \nBack down memory lane \n\nI see the happiness... I see the pain \nWhere am I... back down memory lane
