The legend is true! Our meal was easily one of my favorites to date, and such a pleasant surprise from this little offshoot of Culinary Dropout. Everything we had was spectacular (save for the tuna tartare which was good not great). \n\nOur order consisted of:\n- Oysters\n- Tuna tartare\n- Crispy frogs legs- A MUST!\n- Crab and warm butter w\/ grilled bread (What dreams are made of)\n- Lobster roll\n- Bouillabaisse- lovely\n\nI was a little hesitant about the frogs legs at first, (it was hard to wrap my head around eating a frog.) But I had give to them a try. And guess what? They were FANTASTIC. We couldn't stop gushing over that sweet, spicy, sticky sauce and how perfectly they complimented the crispy frogs legs. Now I'm ALLLLL about dem frogs. Then the crab came...and I almost died, it was so good. Everything about this dish was perfectly executed and delicious.  Delicate, sweet juicy crabmeat swimming in a jar of warm, butter.  We polished the entire plate (and jar, which I would have also eaten).  I could eat this every day of my life.\n\nIt's a casual spot but the dishes blew all the fancy, upscale seafood restaurant meals we've had in the past, out of the water.  The service was attentive and the chef was gracious and so hospitable. We will absolutely be back... cannot wait!
