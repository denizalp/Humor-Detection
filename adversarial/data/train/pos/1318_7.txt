ive still never eaten here but might change that in the future.  we come here a lot just to sit at the ice bar and enjoy a drink.  we always get martinis as you probably should when you come here.  this time we did.  i have no idea what the one i got was called but i enjoyed it.  then i decided to try their russian mary.  i love bloody mary's and am kinda picky on them.  they have their own peppered vodka as others have mentioned here and it is so good. it is possibly the second best bloody mary ive ever had next to rj grunts in chicago.  drinks run about $13 a martini and for the russian mary.  give it a try if you're nearby mandalay.  it is worth making a special trip down there for just to get a drink.  this is a place we've specifically trecked down to mandalay  for.
