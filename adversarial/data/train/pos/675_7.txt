I watch the show Pawn Stars -- hey, I find the dudes entertaining and I actually learn a lot of cool historical stuff. I had some time to kill, so why not pay a visit to the shop? I skimmed through most of the Yelp reviews, so I knew what to expect going in. I kept my expectations pretty low, and I knew I did not want to wait in any line.\n\nLuckily there was no line, so we strolled right in. I immediately recognized a lot of things from the show. Yes, the actual pawn shop is pretty small. We spent no more than 5-10 minutes walking around looking at some of the overpriced (check that, really overpriced) items on display. I thought it was cool that they put notes next to the items that was featured on the show. I found myself saying, \"oh yeah, I remember seeing that on the show!\"\n\nTowards the back of the shop is where they sell all of their souvenirs like shirts, shot glasses, etc -- especially the Chum Lee stuff. It's pretty cheesy, but hey if I were them, I would've done the same thing. Why not capitalize on the show and fame? They friggin' own a pawn shop, and it's in Vegas -- the tourist capital of the world! That being said, I didn't buy anything.\n\nSeeing the employee area was cool -- where it says \"no pictures in this direction.\" No sight of the old man, however. I didn't expect to see anyone from the show, anyway. After taking a few snap shots both inside and out, that was it. On to the next thing in Vegas. But now when I watch the show, I can now say \"I've been there!\"
