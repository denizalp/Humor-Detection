The waitresses of this place are really cool and effective; they make you feel welcomed, try to make small chat  (point for charming ppl), smile, are fast, accurate, plus look pretty happy in general.\n\nThe premises are spacious, I like the lighting (hang over friendly), there are some Tv's showing sports, a patio, parking, and a large bar area.\n\nThey offer amazing deals on beer, it's an affordable place to hang out. The ambiance is similar to a Pub but with decent food.\n\nI love the fact that they are open late, they've rescued me from late night broth cravings. Phó is the perfect pre\/after party meal, specially when the winter winds are blowing. Phó has become one of my magic potions against the flu, indigestion (just sipped the broth with mint), hangovers, lack of energy, and when feeling like eating noodles.\n\nI've brought friends who also liked the joint, what is not to like when we add: late night+cheap boost+good food???
