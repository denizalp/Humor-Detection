Oh, man!! This place is so good. Totally worth the drive into the \"Chinatown\" of LV. I never knew   this part of town even existed! \n\nAnyway, a lot of folks say go for the lobster pho... But I would recommend the salted pepper lobster. It's not done exactly in the same style as most salted pepper stuff, but it's pretty close. The sauce is amazing perched a top a bed of garlic noodles. I think it was the owner that came over to us and said that's actually his favorite way of cooking up the lobsters. They don't have it all the time though so we did get pretty lucky. \n\nWe also had the mekong noodles and the sirloin pho. The mekong noodles were really good... Loved the quail eggs in this. I do have to say that the pho was only ok - I would probably not order this again. \n\nDrinks... They have some great things on the menu. My fiancee and I got the Vietnamese coffee with Henny. Really tasty.
