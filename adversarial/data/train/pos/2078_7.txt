Even if you aren't handy or think you don't like tools, you'll love Harbor Freight! This unassuming little store sells all sorts of handyman items at near wholesale prices. It's so much cheaper than Home Depot!\n\nThe inventory isn't huge so they may not have what you're looking for, but it's fun to browse, especially on days when they are having a sale. I'm new to the party but it seems like they are generous with sending out coupons so you can save even more money. There's a nice selection of power tools, axes, tool chests, and random junk you don't even know you need (like a safe that's made to look like a book and solar powered outdoor security cameras). Everything is well organized and the store, while not fancy at all, is easy to move around in (wide aisles). They even offer a free lifetime guarantee on most of their tools! What?\n\nThe employees are super friendly and knowledgeable, and parking is easy. Note that the actual store is located BEHIND an abandoned storefront, which makes it look like the place is out of business. It's not. This particular location is close to a Home Depot in case they don't have what you need, but always check here first. Super cheap.
