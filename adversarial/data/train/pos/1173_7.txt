Imagine this:\nYou are at a picnic. Someone drops half of a hot-dog. Someone else steps on it. A few days later, it is covered in ants.\n\nYou are better off feeding that hot dog to your loved one than sending them to Haven Senior Horizon.  \n\nI want people to read this review so I am going to keep it concise and exclude details of bodily functions:\n\n- Uncle Joe was old\n- He had Alzheimer's and Parkinson's\n- He was able to walk, talk, feed himself, and use the restroom alone (okay, one mention of bodily function...)\n\nOn Sept 30th, he fell and hit his head. Despite seeming fine, Aunt Dawn called the paramedics just to be safe.\n\nHe went to the Osborn Medical Center in Scottsdale. They sent him to Haven Senior Horizons to \"balance his medications.\"  We still do not know why they felt this was necessary or why they selected this specific place.\n\nSr. Horizons did not allow visiting while balancing Joe's medication.\n\nDawn dropped off three additional outfits and an extra pair of shoes.\n\nAfter a week, they allowed her to visit and this is what she saw:\n\n- Joe was in a wheelchair, unable to walk\n- Joe was 10 pounds thinner (despite already being thin)\n- He was not bathed\n- He was wearing the exact same clothing (unwashed) and shoes that did not belong to him\n- He could not talk\n- His lips were so dry that they were white and cracked\n- He had trouble remaining conscious\n\nTo summarize:\n***Before Haven Sr Horizons, Joe was old but clean and acted alive\n***After Haven Sr Horizons, Joe smelled like poop (really, no more bodily functions after this) and acted dead.\n\nDawn confronted the psychiatrist - the infamous Opechowski that is mentioned in previous reviews. \n\nDawn asked him how he was able balance medication on an unconscious patient.  Opechowski answered her with a threat - \"Would you prefer we take away all his medications and not take care of him?\"\n\nDawn ceased instigation because she did not want her husband to further suffer. \n\nA few days later, Joe was admitted to St. Joe's hospital without ANY communication from Haven Sr Horizon. \n\nIn the emergency room, Joe was unconscious, still unbathed, still in his dirty clothing (it has now been 12 days), and violently jerking from being off his Parkinson's medication. \n\nBut, you know why he was in the hospital?\nNot because Parkinson's. \nNot because of Alzheimer's.\nNot because of his fall.\nNot because he was old.\n\nBECAUSE HIS KIDNEYS WERE FAILING FROM DEHYDRATION.\n\nJoe died in the hospital on September 18th at 4:07 PM.\n\nThe crazy part of this story is that he probably would still be alive had Dawn given him a three-day old, stepped on hot dog, covered in ants instead of allowing him to go to Haven Senior Horizon.\n\nThe point of this review is not to reveal some big scandal. There are  other reviews clearly showing this is not an unusual experience. There must be systemic issues at play that makes recurrence possible.\n\nAlso, Joe was old.\nHe was going to die relatively soon.\nWe get it.\n\nBut he didn't have to die from neglect.  He didn't have to be in pain.\nHis family could have been treated with kindness and compassion.\n\nSo what is the point of this review?\nTo remind everyone that even though old people drive too slow with their left blinker forever on, write checks at busy grocery stores, and take three hours to order off a menu, they are not criminals.\n\nThey are consumers.  \n\nPlaces like Haven Sr Horizon and people like \"Dr\" Opechowski bill Medicare a lot of money. They get paid to provide a service. You have a right to refuse that service.\n\nIf anyone wants to send your loved one to Haven Senior Horizon, tell them \"NO thank you, I will just feed them a smashed hot dog instead.\"
