Garry Anderson's a nice guy but his service is no good.  He replaced my iPhone 6 Plus screen for $60, but it stopped working within two weeks.  I contacted him multiple times to honor his warranty or provide a refund to no avail, so I went to a different repair shop to get it replaced for $100.  They mentioned that the previous replacement was done poorly. Screws along with other parts were missing, and the actual replacement screen was a cheap version from China.\n\nThere's a noticeable difference to the superior screen quality with the 2nd shop.  I highly recommended to spend a little extra money and go through a shop that provides quality work, it will save you money in the long run.
