It's not the strip, blah blah blah, it's old, blah blah blah, should have stayed at the Golden Nugget, blah blah blah. If you want to get technical, you can tear Four Queens apart. But I'm cool with it. \n\nYes, Four Queens is an older property. It hasn't been remodeled in the 10 years I've been coming here (although the South tower is currently being completely gutted and remodeled). It's not a boutique hotel. It's not trendy. The casino has a strong rose scent which is oddly comforting to me- you can smell it outside of the casino. Wake up and smell the roses! \n\nYeah I get comped rooms here, so I'm a little biased. It's in the middle of the Fremont Street Experience. The air works, the beds are comfortable, the shower is rad and my rooms have always been clean. The first time I stayed here the hotel offered a 24 hour porno package. A major bonus is that this hotel offers room service. I'm assuming it's from Magnolia's Cafe downstairs (which always has a long wait) but its in your room in 20 minutes which is great for lazy afternoons when you're resting off the night before. \n\nAlso, Hugo's. The best fucking restaurant I've ever ate at. Make a reservation, dress nice, and prepare to lounge in your room in a food coma for a considerable amount of time afterwards. \n\nThanks Four Queens. See ya soon.
