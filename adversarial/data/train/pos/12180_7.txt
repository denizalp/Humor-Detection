Can't miss out trying Schwartz in Montreal when we arrived for a short weekend visit. The Schwartz meat sandwich was pretty good but not as great as what I had expected. Prior to trying, there was a lot of hype about it. \n\nThe sandwich was packed with slices of succulent smoked meat with thin slices of bread. A little too much meat but I guess that's also what makes the sandwich so great for others.
