drunk at kona someone in our group shouts, \"LET'S GO SING KARAOKE!!!!!!!!!\" \n\nit was the best idea of the night, obviously. \n\nwe called a bunch of karaoke bars and all had the lame response of only on sundays or thursdays. \n\ndon't they know wednesday nights are where it's at?!?! \n\nwe finally found this place. and they had karaoke. on wednesdays. they might have it every night. in fact, they should have it every night because that's the only reason to go to this bar. \n\nit is really skanky but a freaking blast. the patrons are unattractive but fun to sing with. and that's all that matters when you're trying to rock out to dixie chicks. good times.\n\nalso, i don't think i'd ever eat here. i dont get the food vibe from this place. i've never had their food but just from hanging out in there i know i wouldn't touch their food. but that's just me i guess.
