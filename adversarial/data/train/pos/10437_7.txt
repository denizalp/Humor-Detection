Big, wide open area located in Toronto for all large fairs and events! University Fairs, Autoshows, Bridal Shows, International Midwifery Events will all be hosted at the Metro Toronto Convention Centre. \n\nIt's located right by the skywalk, the CN Tower and Ripley's Aquarium - definitely a place to visit for any large events and shows that happen in Toronto. It's also fairly easy to come here if you are in Union Station! \n\nThe washrooms are fairly clean, but on a global scale, considering that this is the convention centre that represents Toronto, I feel like it might need a bit of renovation to illustrate the beauties of Toronto!
