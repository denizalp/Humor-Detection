Worst service.. It takes time to place order; there was only one waiter initially and then the second comes in after 10 minutes.. We said the second waiter we are ready place an order he said, the other waiter will take you order.. They took our order after 20 minutes after a couple of attempts asking him to take our order.. \n\nFood was not Good. Ordered arrived in another 10 minutes. \n\nTo pay the bill we had to wait for another 15 min.. We didn't get the check to our table so I went to the front desk to pay.. The waiter\/ receptionist ignored a couple of times.. I was running out time and patience so I asked to him front the desk, do you want me to pay or leave? He didn't apologize just asked which table.. Paid and felt..
