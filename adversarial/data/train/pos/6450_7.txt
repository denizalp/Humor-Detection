GENERAL NOTES\nIt's a cheapo sushi\/korean place. It can be fast and it is good. Great lunch takeout options, at least that's what I've been using it for. I haven't sat down in the restaurant yet and I don't really plan to. If I was going to sit down it would probably be for slightly better fare. I tried a cali roll and a spicy salmon roll...both were better than mediocre, worse than very good. Which is usually a bad place for sushi to be.\n\nMENU RECOMMENDATIONS\nChicken teriyaki + Shrimp tempura takeaway special - $5.99!\nIt's a good amount of pretty decent food. The tempura is good but if you're taking away make sure you run, that shit don't last. Also, you're guaranteed to get a slice of fried regular potato. Not great. The chicken is good though. A very cauc-friendly option that won't upset your innards before that 3 o'clock meet.\n\nSERVICE NOTES\nIf you're going to take away, call ahead or die. 25 minutes it took for me to get all my shit the first time, every other time I called ahead and it's been waiting for me.\n\nLOCATION NOTES\nHidden beside Gardenview convenience and pet supplies on the NW corner of Queen and John.\n\nHUMOUROUS STORY\nThis place gets a 3 for quality, a 4 for price and a 3.5 for counter girl cleavage watching. Not that I like to check out Asian girls - it feels a bit like checking out the sister I don't have - but still, I'm a man and I appreciate low cut tops on subservient women.
