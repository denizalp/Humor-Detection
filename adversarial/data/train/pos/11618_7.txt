This is really a 4.5 star rating for me, but I decided to bump it up to the max 5 stars because we were well attended to that night. Everyone from the front doormen, our host, the busboy and our cocktail waitress was a gem. They kept our drinks, ice and table service full all night.\n\nAlso, I would like to add that it's not a great idea to write reviews on a place, whether if it's a restaurant, retail store, business, nightclub, hotel etc...etc..that have JUST opened. Seriously...how would you like it if you personally opened up a restaurant and people are already giving you bad reviews?! EVERYTHING new would not be 100% at first....let them work out the kinks, visit them again and give them a second try before you write your review.\n\nThe venue is actually really big and spacious. Throughout the night...I can feel air circulating throughout the nightclub so it was NOT stuffy at all...even though our table was located in the middle of everything. EC Twins were playing that night and they had really cool visual effects like laser beams, lighting and paper confetti galore.\n\nBathrooms: Let me tell you this. It's probably one of the better bathroom areas when it comes to Vegas nightclubs. No line whatsoever in the women's restroom...plenty of stalls available. Went a couple times throughout the night and both times were very clean and does not smell.  \n******NOTE:****** co-ed sinks. Like it or not, I think it's really efficient. \n\nAND...best part of this club...THEY HAVE A FREAKIN PHOTO BOOTH HERE!!!!!!!! FOR FREE!!!!!!!! And the picture quality turned out clear. You take 4 different poses and they send it to you through email AND have one physically printed out for you in less than 5 minutes. How awesome is that!? Geez...that's already worth 3 stars alone!
