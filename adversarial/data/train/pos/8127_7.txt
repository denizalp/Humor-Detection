\"Belee dat\"  I can officially confirm the hype.\n\nIt should be Pizza Counter With No Name and not Secret Pizza... not important though.  \n\nIt was fun tracking through the Cosmo with my swerve on trying to find this place.  It took about 45 minutes.\n\nWe ordered the white pizza.  The crust is thin and holds up well when folded.   The crust was crispy on the bottom and had a slight chew to it.  The crust was perfect.  I would like a comforter made for my bed from this crust.\n\nThe pizza was topped off with a perfect melody of garlic and ricotta.  \n\nIf someone stole my car and left me 2 of these pizzas in the parking spot, I think I would be happy.  \n\nLater that night I dreamed I was in bed with Selma Hyeck.  She was wearing a white tank top with no bra and my boxer shorts. We were watching Married With Children laughing having a good time.  I was eating a whole white pizza from this Pizza Place With No Name.  She reached inside the pizza box and tried to grab a piece.  I quickly moved the box from her reach and said \"My Pizza.\"  Then I kicked Selma out of bed, and said \"go sleep on the couch CRAZY!\"  She apologized and slept at the foot of the bed.\n\nIn reality, this place gets a lot of attention because most pizza joints in this town suck!  With that being said, The Best Pizza in Las Vegas.
