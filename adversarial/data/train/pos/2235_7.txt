Complete and utter crap! Resume Rick is a complete rip off. I am in industry that has completely different language\/terminology that most people would not understand. He never called to try and understand what I do for a living or for clarification. The product I received was beyond sub-par. I had to have my resume re-created by someone else.\n\nPOOR RESULT AND PRODUCT!  Resume Rick is certainly not for people with extensive work experience and leadership.  Expect a lack-luster product you can easily produce yourself.  It is evident that he utilizes pieces of information from other resumes and is EXTREMELY generic.  His product is not at all customized. \n\nHe actually said \"What do you expect for $100?\"
