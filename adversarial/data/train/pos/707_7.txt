The worst movie theater ever!! I was watching the Maze Runner with my small children and I had to watch out for my phone because i was waiting for an important txt an employee came from behind me and told me \"if I had to tell you one more time to put your phone down I will have to kick you out\"... So I went outside to talk to this employee since I had not been told before and it would have been nice for him to show some tact and the Manager Rudely told me that I cannot go back in  the theater and that he was going to write the employee up for not kicking me out in the first place.  I was NOT talking on the phone I simply lighted up my phone (which was in the lowest brightness) to see if I had received the text. Rude, disgusting and inconsiderate people ESPECIALLY EDWIN!!!  I went back in the theater to let the kids know that I was going to be right outside to wait for them and they started crying so I had to leave with my munchkins. Should have they just said, \"ma'am can u please not use your cell while in the theater or we would have to have you leave the theater\" would have been much better! Edwin should be FIRED!!!!!\n\nI am guessing Gwen did not read my review. I was not texting or on the phone. My phone was on my lap and I pressed the button on my iphone just to see if I had received a very important txt. Your Manager Edwin was very RUDE and Nasty and my children were crying. i WOULD NEVER go back there and I will be posting my review everywhere!!!
