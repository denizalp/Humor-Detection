I had dinner here last time in Vegas.  We tried a number of appetizers, salads, and other dishes.  We had foie gras, duck, a couple of the salads, lamb shank...I can't remember everything we had.  But I do remember the foie gras blew me away...and that's all I really remember.  Oh also we had an oyster each at the end, in lieu of dessert.  I guess the oyster was kinda sweet...so whatever.\n\nThe waiters and staff were helpful, I had a predinner drink at the bar with a friend too.  Also, our waiter helped us play a prank on the guy in our party who paid with a credit card...which involved writing a deceptively high gratuity on the receipt...that was fun!
