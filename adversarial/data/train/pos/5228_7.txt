My friend was in town and insisted on seeing this show. I have to admit that I am not a fan of Michael Jackson, so I was reluctant about purchasing tickets.\n\nI was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed this show. I enjoyed each of the interpretations of all the songs they took on not only the more well-known songs, but also some of the lesser known songs from his entire career. The dancers are all very talented and they take many of Jackson's signature moves and are able to incorporate them in many different types of dance and acrobatics.\n\nThe sound system is excellent and enhances the experience. I highly recommend this show.
