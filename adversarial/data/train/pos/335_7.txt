Black cashier takes his sweet time and chats making a long line to purchase items. Was rude when I asked him to pick up the pace. Gave rude comments, was about to punch him in the face but was really in a hurry. I asked for his name and manager's number... didn't give the number. \n\nI will go to corporate and complain to get his ass fired.
