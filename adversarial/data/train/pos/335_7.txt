This is the most adorable place to get breakfast, brunch or lunch. The patio is gorgeous and it's equally as charming inside.\n\nThe menu offers all your typical fare- omelets and pastries in the morning, sandwiches and salads in the afternoon. The pastries looked and tasted delectable. Our complimentary berry scones were buttery, dense with the perfect amount of tenderness. For my entree I chose the wild mushroom, spinach and goat cheese tart. It was a sizable portion, served with seasoned potatoes and fresh fruit. The tart itself was a punch of flavors and textures. I gobbled it right up along with those potatoes and fruit! I liked all the components of the tart, from the flaky buttery crust, the different cheeses, and the earthy flavor of the mushrooms and spinach. The potatoes were well seasoned and soft and the fresh fruit consisted of pineapple and strawberry.\n\nIf you dine outside it's cute to see all the sparrows perching and flitting around your table. I think they are really keeping their beady little eyes on any leftover plates or scones though! \n\nService was decent. Drinks were refilled as needed. \n\nThe tart was $12 which I thought was reasonable given the quality and size of my dish. \n\nThe only real negatives I could find were that some of the outdoor patio cushions for the chairs looked like they could use a good cleaning. There's also a small parking lot at the Marketplace but chances are you'll be parking on the street. Spots can get filled up if there's an event going on, plus the general fact it's in downtown Scottsdale.\n\nI did spy a sign that said they offer afternoon tea on the weekdays too so I may have to come back and try that out sometime!
