amazing leasing experience, loved working with Don, Harris, Cathy, and Jeff. They really made our experience smooth and easy. everyone at Findlay Honda Henderson is so nice, friendly, and a pleasure to work with. as a young couple with a baby having a safe car and reasonable price. we love our new Honda Civic Sedan EX\n\n10\/29\/15\n: ok, so this week was rough, while being audited at work, and inter office dilemmas, I had a tire blow out , not good, not this week of all weeks. but once again, our trusted incredibly friendly friends at Findlay Honda Henderson came threw. I called and explained my blow out dilemma, got my Honda Road Side Assistance to come\nchange my tire, went to the dealership, and had my new replacement tire comped, The Dealership said it was their way of saying thanks for not only being a repeat loyal customer but for all the recommendations Jennifer and I are happy to spread the word of the wonderful treatment and experience we always have. Thank you Don StaMaria, Harris Rapaport, Cathy Boyd, and Eleazar \"Al\" Cardenas, you guys each have been the best to work with each and every time.  We love our Honda and will continue to always go to and recommend Findlay Honda Henderson.
