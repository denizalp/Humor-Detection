I've used Key Property Management several times over the past few years and I've always been very satisfied.  They were extremely quick renting out my two properties each time and responded quickly to the few issues I had with the tenants.  Now that the economic times have shifted and I no longer have my properties, I used Key to find a rental house and was again very pleased with their service.  Found the perfect house in no time with their help.  Highly recommended.
