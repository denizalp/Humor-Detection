Visited last night.  Pretty good vibe here and great date night spot! The food and wine were awesome. The rooftop area was nice, but just fyi it's first come for the space.  Having seen previous reviews I assumed there was patio seating for dinner - but the patio is more if a chill spot for before or after your dinner. The only part of the night that was a downer was the disorganization   at the hostess station. We arrived 30 mins early and it took them 5 mins just to enter that we had arrived.  There were many empty tables and we were told just a few minutes we would be seated. We went to the bar and after laughing and talking we realized an hour had gone by. Instead of getting upset we just ordered dinner at the bar...15 mins later we got a txt saying our table was ready. After dinner we told them about our disappointment and their repose was \" we forgot, sorry\". But we enjoyed ourselves just the same and would give them another try.
