Because he can!!!!\n\nThat's the answer to why Tom Colicchio has his name on a pricey, non-descript but overcrowded sammich shop.\n\nIt is perfect for running to in a moment of despair when you're hanging out at Wet Republic when it 103 degrees out and you don't want to pay for overpriced nachos poolside. After 3 frozen margaritas and one something they call a Miami Vice couldn't cool me off I ran to witchcraft for a goat cheese, portabello mushroom, spinich and pesto on honeywheat (?) with avo for $9.95 as an excuse to use the air conditioning.  It was good and very filling but I could have made it myself.  Well my friend Sarah could have made it, she's better at that stuff.  \n\nSo it is what it is.  It's very useful in Vegas.  more useful than putting it all on black.
