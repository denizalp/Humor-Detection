First of anthony L how could you comment on specifics thats happend if you were not present at the time! That is not what happend at all. I was not offered a discount nor a different gel color instead i received cindy yelling at me and steven pushing my phone out of my hand as i was trying to take a picture. Im not the type of person to ask for a handout. I had a picture of what i wanted done on my nails and i did not received what was on the image. So for you anthony L to comment on my post is another example of how your store is run. Unfair to the fullest! This place is so unprofessional !!\n\n\nOh turns out the technian that helped me was not jamie but cindy. Cindy is using jamies name. i guess from going on to their website the supposably owner, the one who pushed my phone towards me was her husband steven. Idk if they are the owners, but on the website they are managers! Its so crazy how they are suppose to show respect to their customers and treat them with respect and honor because we are the ones who are paying them, but instead they show total disrespect telling me 45 dollars wasn't anything. And steven had the nerve to tell me no one was going to believe anything i said because there was them 2 versus me. Oh can it get any worse? This store has the worse hospitality and experiece ever let's not mention the quality of work! I would think the manager cindy was one of the best technitions, but cindy does a terrible work! Be aware if you get cindy you are just wasting your money#!
