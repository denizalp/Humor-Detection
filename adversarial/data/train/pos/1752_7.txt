Another wonderful spot where you can put your feet up, relax and enjoy a handcrafted coffee in a cool atmosphere surrounded by a relatively young crowd of coffeeholics!\n\nOne side of the establishment is dominated by a TV that may be showing what you want to watch-but maybe not.\n\nIf you are not familiar with the area, this is one of those spots that is not very close to a freeway, although the 101 to the west is relatively close. If you are approaching from the east, you probably will drive along Shea. At certain times of the day, traffic will cause you to pull your hair out trying to get here.\n\nThe coffee here is very smooth and you will enjoy the flavor. If tea is your drink of choice, you have a number of different flavors from which to choose.\n\nSit back in one of the comfortable couches and savor your coffee while relaxing or people watching. If you are here for business, there should be enough space to focus and work.
