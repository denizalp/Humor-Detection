Setting: Saturday evening - a little early for dinner but my son had skipped lunch playing at his friend's. It was barely 5:00.\n\nFirst strike. We waited 5 mins even though more than half the tables were empty. We should've been seated immediately. The man behind me asked, \"Really? We have to wait and there's 10 tables ready right now?!?!\" The hostess said something about new wait staff coming on and she wasn't sure who was assigned to which tables .. something like that.\n\n2nd strike. After we were seated, we waited another 5+ mins for a wait person to appear. I had to ask her for a kid's menu. \n\nAll I ordered was a drink and the kid ordered some wings. \n\nI sipped at my margarita and almost gagged. It was like I had ordered a large SALT WATER. Looking at the bottom of the glass, there was a pile of salt clearly visible. GROSS! Now I know the rim usually has salt around it but I've never had a margarita with salt actually in the drink. It was awful. 3rd strike. \n\nI had to ask the waitress to take the drink off the bill. The glass was still full and I lifted it to show her all the salt in the bottom. No apology. She acted like that was no big deal. \n\nBut she did take it off the bill. \n\nLearned my lesson. Won't return. NYPD Pizza is closer to me anyway.
