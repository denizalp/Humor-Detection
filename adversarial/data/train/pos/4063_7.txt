I love this plaza for its variety. Congee Wong AND a PetSmart? Are you kidding me? Throw in the Chapters, Micheal's Crafts, and arcade and you've pretty much covered all my needs in life. \n\nI had a blind date at the movie theater here that did not end too well.. I mean, the guy pretended he was Spider Man and shot imaginary webs from his wrists and ran around the cinema.. but it makes for a good story, yeah?
