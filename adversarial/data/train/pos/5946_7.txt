In a town where your night-out options all too often revolve around going down to Richmond St to wait in line with a bunch of shaved-chest douchebags from Richmond Hill or Mississauga, the Brunny is actually a worthwhile endeavour...\n\nOr maybe not.  It's a hole, pure and simple, and by the time you're 20, you're too old for the place.  But it does have beer, and you can get drunk and pick people up...My friend Dave's parents even met there, if you can believe it.  And back in the day, they had Rockin' Irene and her ancient husband and their absurd brand of Thursday night accordion music.  Those two are probably dead now, but the Brunny lives on.
