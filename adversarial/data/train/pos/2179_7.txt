This joint IS a dive bar. not a punk rock dive bar, but a real life dive. A dive bar is hood. a dive bar scares you a little bit upon arrival (admit it) but it's that fear that keeps you coming back, This place is a tad seedy.  Not quite the seediest, but you won't see a bachlorette party here. ever. Before there was pub crawls here, we made our own. This was #5 on the list, the bartender was a really cool old rocker chick, real cool lady. They had a deal ANY shot AND  ANY beer for 3 bucks that still might be going on. We got gangsta and where doing shots of crown and spraying each other with the beer. Rocker bartender joined in. epic!
