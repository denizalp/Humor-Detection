This place is so fresh and so green green!!! :) \n  I loved my chicken wrap, to bad their so close to my official work place or else I would eat this over Jimmy John's and Subway any day!! This time I was luckily around the area getting training done at another work location nearby this little bad boy!! \n How lucky was I, I had heard of this place from an old classmate from Tempe, he used to work here and also had invited me over to try some of their goodness, plus the prices are affordable and understandable to their selections!! \nI truly loved the flavors in my wrap, so full and bold, I was satisfied and still feeling healthy in the end!! \nWay to go ZK Bistro!!!!!! You rock!!! :) I look forward to coming here more often!!
