Wow. \nI was overwhelmed by this store. On a weekend trip to Toronto for a family wedding, I was dropped off at Fairview Mall for a few hours to find some accessories. I had heard about Forever 21 and had perused online but never ordered. Once I stepped foot inside, I was immediately in heaven!\nI ransacked the plus size section and the accessories and couldnt believe the low prices. Great for disposable clothing, which I dont mind mixing int with classic, longer lasting pieces in my wardrobe. \n\nSome of the staff were wonderful, others were snarky. I couldnt tell if it was different because of it being Toronto or if they were just unhappy, haha!\n\nAnyways, I'm back in Halifax now and my dear mama who is still there is going back to get more pieces for me. \n\nViva Forever21!
