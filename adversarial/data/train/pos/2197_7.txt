Eh.\n\nFirst, when I was walking up, there was a large amount of glass broken, and spread out by the front entrance. When I entered, I told the young man working, and his answer was, \"Oh, really?\".\n\nUh, yeah.\n\nMy MIL and I were here to run the indoor track, since there was a wind advisory this afternoon.\nTheir track is not marked on how many laps equals what......\n\nAnd the staff doesn't know either. They have a sign, but jeez, you need a Phd to figure it out. Someone draw me a picture.\n\nMoving on...\n\nThe track is circled around their fitness equipment...So, if you are running, like we were, watch out. People are so clueless and just walk out like they own the place. It's funny that they say kids 13-15 must be accompanied by an adult....that obviously isn't enforced. There were middle schoolers using the equipment today, on their phones, walking on the track.....\n\nIN THE LEFT \"RUNNING\" LANE. Ugh. I was ready to harm a child.\n\nAfter our workout, we went downstairs to get a bottle of water.\nThe vending machines have signs that say \"Use at your own risk\" taped on them, and require exact change. When asking the front staff if they had five ones, they immediately said no.\n\nWalking out, the glass was still every where. I guess people's safety isn't important here. \nNot even a \"wet floor\" sign or a traffic cone.... I mean, really? Two girls ran by us, in the glass, causing more of it to spread.....awesome.\n\nAll in all....I'd rather run outside in the wind or drive up to multigen.
