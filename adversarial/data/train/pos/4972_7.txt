This was my first time at the Monte Carlo Hotel, and there was really nothing special about our stay. We would normally find ourselves at the Bellagio, so it was incredibly convenient that there is a free tram that connects Monte Carlo to Crystals to Bellagio. \n\nThe casino and the rooms felt a little outdated. The room looked minimally clean, but upon closer inspection, the beds were dirty with black specks and I found little bugs in the room. I think the bugs may have come in from when they cleaned our room and had forgotten to close the windows...On our last day, we were attempting to check out in our room, but we weren't able to because the TV was doing something funky upon choosing that option. It's no big deal because we ended up checking out downstairs, but it was my understanding that checking out in our rooms was a simple convenience that most other hotels had. Eh. I wouldn't come here to shop since there weren't many options, I wouldn't come here to gamble, and there's no major attraction that Monte Carlo can boast outside of the Blue Man Group.\n\n2 free bottles of water and coffee a day + buffet passes for guests. At least Monte Carlo was on the strip, so I wouldn't mind staying here again.
