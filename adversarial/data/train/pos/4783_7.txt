My friend brought me to Silk Elephant on my last night in Squirrel Hill before moving out, and I felt super fancy coming here.  It's not that it is that fancy, but it has an upscale and intimate vibe that I love.  The service is also spot on, and you will never feel ignored throughout your meal.  Water is instantly filled, and the servers really want to make sure you have a nice meal.\n\nLet's get to what really matters, the food and drink.  I started my meal with a green tea mojito, which was interesting.  It was not my favorite drink ever, but it was a cool idea.  My friend ordered something that was like...Ole Mrs. Johnson.  It was delicious.  The drink prices were not bad for off-the-beaten-path cocktails.  After our drinks, we decided to get the Taro Crunch appetizer ($4.50).  It was taro deep-fried in a black sesame seed batter and came with sweet and sour sauce with peanuts.  It was different and good.  For my meal, I got Pad Thai ($13.99) at a spice level of 3.  It was a bit mild for my taste so I probably should have gone with a five or six, but it was good.  The portions were huge, and the prices were a little high but not terrible.\n\nAll in all, this isn't a quick and cheap Thai, but it is a nice dinner out.
