Not Yo Nacho Daddy sucked balls big time! The only reason for the one star is for the company I was with who made the experience pleasant and also for the 80's music. \n\nWe decided to go with the El Traditional Nachos full order for $13.95 and were completely disappointed. The chips were too thin to hold the heavy weight of tasteless toppings. The cheese was watery and almost transparent and they slop chili meat on it that could pass for dog food. Actually, I don't even think my dog would go for this bullshit on a plate. The grease was swimming around the nachos like a moat. Super sad face. \n\nNow the service was not bad and the restaurant appeared clean. Does that warrant more stars? Hell no, it's all about the product baby and if you name a restaurant Nacho Daddy you better learn how to make some freakin nachos! Hated it.
