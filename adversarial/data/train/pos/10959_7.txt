The Back Alley is also known as the \"Crack Alley\" in Calgary. This is because it is the funnest scummy rock club in Calgary! I obviously enjoy slumming it as there are always fun stories to be had at the alley. The kind of stories that make people laugh and cringe at the same time. A friend of mine once said you were ten times as likely to get in a fight as to get laid at the alley. This is true. \n\nThe girls are skanked out or in their best tank tops, the guys are scuzzy and the overall ratio is about 1 to 5. That means that if you are a female attention whore, this is the place for you! The mood lighting makes everyone look great.\n\nAlso, it is really hard to dance to rock music. If you are a headbang master, like I am (left over from my hardcore days) you'll still do alright. There are also girls on speakers! Do expect to lose your hearing for several days after your visit. Also take a visit to the grossest public washrooms in Calgary.\n\nIf you are looking for a scuzzy atmosphere, a fight or to get it on in one of the loudest, stickiest rock bars in Calgary, the Back Alley is for you. But good luck trying to hail a cab on Macleod at 2 am.
