Steel Cactus is a chain that just happens to have an outpost here in the airport. I have never been to any of their regular locations so this was a new experience for me.\n\nAs one of my passport stops on my recent Yelp event this was one of the last places my husband and I stumbled upon. We were fairly full but decided we could squeeze in just one taco and chips.\n\nThe taco was a dark meat chicken taco and the chips were just okay. Again, this is your typical airport fare but it at least gave me the impression what this Mexican restaurant was serving. Since it is designed for traveling, you order at the counter then pick up your food at the other end.\n\nTheir other locations are in Shadyside and Southside. Located on the left side in the center of the food court in the airside terminal, food court seating is located behind the row of fast eateries or you can take your bagged food directly to your gate for your flight.
