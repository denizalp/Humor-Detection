Open shopping mall with lots of options for fast casual and fast food dining, as well as picking up some items.  The budget-designer clothing store, Ross, here is a good one, and a favorite of our family's.  Office Max is convenient and helpful here, too.  There is a Starbucks, a Verizon store, and a Vitamin Shoppe that is better than average.
