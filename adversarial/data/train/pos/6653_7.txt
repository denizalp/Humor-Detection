I could have sworn the location of this buffet was where the \"World Buffet\" once was. I guess it's changed. Of course I was excited as this was my first time EVER trying out the Seafood Buffet, thanks to D-Block aka David B., we were in Sin City and got a chance to try this out.\n\nFirst and foremost, the wait is LONG. Be prepared, unless you come as soon as it opens, I believe we were in line for a good hour or so and this was BEFORE it got really busy for the dinner rush.\n\nOverall, nothing stood out completely as to which I enjoyed the most, but I know nothing was \"gross\" or didn't taste right. It was really decent, but didn't wow me as much as I thought it would. The seafood was plentiful (batches never ran out), it tasted decently fresh, but not straight from the ocean fresh.\n\nMaybe on my next trip I'll think about giving them another shot, but if the lines are horrendous again, I'll just go to Hikari for my all-you-can-eat seafood fix in the form of all-you-can-eat sushi\/sashimi.
