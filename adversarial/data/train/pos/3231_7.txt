My husband is having dinner here without me.  \n\nHe's meeting friends of ours who are in town last minute and celebrating their anniversary.  I have a prior commitment, but will be thinking of their dining experience and drooling (discretely, if possible).  \n\nLocation, service, food, libations = fun night out!  \n\nI appreciate GT's local, green principles, and just the overall sense of goodwill in this place.  It has a downtown vibe without being too pretentious.  John was our server the last time we came and he was amazing.  He catered to my dietary needs and made excellent recommendations.  \n\nWe like to order small plates and share.  Some of my favorites are the Local Turnips & Radishes, Sweet Wintered Carrots, Raw & Roasted Rittman Farm Apple and Celery Leaf Salad, Crispy Hominy, Devils on Horseback, and the Pommes Frites w\/raw garlic, rosemary & aioli.  Oh, that garlic!  GT offers dishes to the season, which makes for an exciting menu.\n\nIt's easy to spend a lot of money here, so plan accordingly.  \n\nI promise you, it will be worth it.
