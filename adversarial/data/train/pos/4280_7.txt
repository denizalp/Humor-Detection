Update after about four years here.  Still same quality of service and cleanliness.  On the hottest days (July-September) the swamp coolers can't keep up and it is quite hot and humid in the units.  Not really a fan of the creeping up of costs over the years but what can you do, move your stuff to another place that will do the same thing?  Too big of a hassle it seems.
