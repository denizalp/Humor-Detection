We waited about 30 minutes for a table and it was worth every minute. \n\nI ordered the Hells' Kitchen Burger ($15.00) and my husband decided on the U.K. Burger. ($15.00) Both of these burgers hit it out of the park. They were amazing!! Cooked to perfection!! The Hells' Kitchen was prepared with asadero cheese, roasted jalapeños,fresh avocado, roasted tomatoes and jalapeño pesto aioli. The U.K. had dublinar cheese, major grey's chutney and arugula.  \n\nWe also tried an order of sweet potato fries. ($9.00) They were fresh and hot.
