I should have listened to Lon L.  \nOut of all the Yelpers on Yelp, I respect Lon's reviews the most. I usually agree with his opinions about 99.9999% of the time, but due to the fact that this is the only Fry's in Clark County, I stupidly didn't listen to his review this time. Even Jaime W, wrote a 1-star on this place, but I didn't listen. What was I thinking? \n\nI couldn''t figure out how the get any service here.  The workers just stand around and talk about random stupid things with each other.  Once in a while they will help a customer but it's usually one of those bleached blonde chicks in short-shorts.  If you are a dude or a woman of integrity you probably won't get any service.  When I finally was able to find a worker, he was really groggy and looked like he had been sleeping in a cardboard box in the back.  I told him that I wanted to buy  the TV that was on sale, and it literally took him 15 minutes to tell me that it was sold out. I think afterwards, he went back into the back room and went back to sleep. \n\nThe workers here are the same d-bags that hang out at the Encore on Saturday nights and  tell all the club chicks that they are millionaires. One of my best friends is the poker room supervisor at the South Point, so I visit him occasionally when I have time. While visiting, I always noticed this attention seeking guy who keeps telling everyone that he is a \"pro poker player\". Well, this self-proclaimed pro poker player was working at the floor here at Fry's. \n\nIronically, I ran into Bobby Y.(Misty's husband) a few days ago and he was a little concerned about my safety, due to the fact that I have been getting frequent death threats from business owners, human resource directors, and angry yelpers. He gave me some advice on how to be more \"nice\" and \"positive\". So, I won't go on one of my typical profanity filled rants this time. I'll just end by saying that I should have listened to Lon L and Jaime W.
