Went here for lunch today.  I have eaten takeout from Jaden's several times in years past but this was my first dine in experience.  A few negatives right off the bat.  The parking lot is big, but really needs paved.  I felt like an earthquake had traveled below it.  Nitpicky, maybe, but still.  The interior of the place is pretty dated, and I thought it was in need of a good scrubbing.  There was dried food on the table cloth.  I let it go, but kind of unappetizing.\n\nThey have a few sushi, maki, and sashimi specials on their lunch menu.  I was a bit too hesitant to try, so I opted for shrimp low mien.   I asked for it to be prepared spicy, and it was not at all prepared spicy.  It came with soup and a beef egg roll.  I opted for Hot and Sour soup.  It was pretty standard.  Our lunches came out and they were very big portions for lunch, though the price was about $9.00 so I think the size matched the cost.  You should definitely have leftovers.  My dish, as stated lacked any heat, but I let it go.  It was okay, I fear that they didn't clean their shrimp properly.  I hope it was only the one piece that I found, as I don't need to get sick off the poop.  \n\nI didn't try the beef egg roll.  One it was fried, so not trying to do that anymore, and two a beef egg roll doesn't really sound appealing.  This was seconded by my friend who did eat his and said it wasn't very good.  Overall there are other Chinese\/Sushi\/Thai places local to work, that I'd prefer to go, so it would be unlikely to keep this in my lunch rotation.
