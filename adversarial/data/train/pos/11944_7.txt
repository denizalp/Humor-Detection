Please note this review is about a month old because I thought I had already wrote it.\n\nI had no idea what to do for my birthday so a friend of mine got me tickets to see absinthe and wow BEST BIRTHDAY GIFT EVER! I laughed, I cried from laughing, and I had a great time. This is one of the best shows I have ever seen in Vegas. Penny Pibbets and the Gazillionaire keep up the Vegas spirit of dirty talk and jokes and then the acrobat performers show off what they've got. The music was amazing I regret not buying the soundtrack while I was there. If you're going to see a show in Vegas please don't waste your money on a boring classic cirque du solei go check this show out I promise it will be worth every penny spent.\n\nMy only complaint would be the seating, we had seats in the 4th row and it hurt my neck from having to look up, if you do buy your seats make sure they are more towards the back. I'm also claustrophobic but luckily I had enough bubble space but it is pretty crowded.
