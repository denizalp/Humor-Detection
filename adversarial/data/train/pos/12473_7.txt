I decided to give Excalibur a try because I always stay at the Flamingo. While it wasn't horrible, it definitely will be my last time staying at the hotel. There are just too many hotels with better options for a few dollars more. When I arrived at the hotel to see if I could do an early check in.\nI was met with a line and only two people at the front desk. No technology at this place. \n\nAfter waiting for 30 minutes, I was told that my room wouldn't be ready until close to 12 (I got there at 9). I went to a trade show and still hadn't heard anything at 2pm. When I got back to the hotel at 3 they gave some lame excuse about why they didn't call me. \n\nTo my dismay, My comforter had food crumbs. On top of that the walls are very thin and I can hear every time someone opened or shut the door. Barely got any sleep.Thankfully my room was \nin the Royal tower and it was close to the ride share area.  \n\nAt the end of the day you get what you pay for and I'll just pay a little more.
