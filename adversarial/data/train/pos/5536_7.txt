This is the newest souvenir chain to hit the Strip ( they're everywhere ) & have to say we're fans....much like shops you'd see along any beach boardwalk or in the New Orleans French Quarter, San Francisco's Fisherman's Wharf...you get the idea\n\nThis location is in the Mandalay Bay Shoppes & offered cheesy shirts w\/ funny drunken sayings, coffee mugs, shot glasses & for the 4th, they even had American Flag boxers - & I'm not even beginning to touch on ALL the inventory they offered\n\nBasically everything you'd want to be a cheesy tourist!\n\nWe picked up a glittery postcard for the Mr's parents as well as a cool vintage-looking shirt w\/ the classic \"Welcome To Vegas\" sign\n\nLots to see, try on & have a good laugh
