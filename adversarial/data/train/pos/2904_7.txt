My brainchild idea of arriving at 8:00 a.m. was so original: although the line wrapped the corner it moved fast.  Then about seven minutes for the finished product.\n\nThe Fairfax delivered.  At home I blend mayonnaise in my scrambled eggs then cook slow and low; the taste was similar here.  The bun was very good, a little warmer would have been better.\n\n$9 including tax doesn't scream value, but it's all part of reaching for your wallet when on The Strip.
