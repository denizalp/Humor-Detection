I wanted to not like this place. I'll eat my copy of Dianetics if one can find a single book in this place that has one correct scientific fact. It's book after book of magical thinking. \n\nOf course, why would a skeptic such as myself even put my foot in the door? A friend and I turned up for one of their UFO lectures. We were amused people in this day and age were still adherents of the 1950s Aetherius Society UFO cult preaching a Day the Earth Stood Still mythology mixed with yoga. These are people that believe a British dude from the 1950s piloted a space ship with Jesus and defeated higher vibrational Cylons or some such rot. Srsly. Oh yeah, they also believe Jesus was from Venus. They really believe this. Oh, proof was going to be offered. No \"proof\" was offered, other than \"our L. Ron predicted something that was already in the news. So, how do you explain that!\"  (http:\/\/www.cosmicwarrior.com\/proof.htm)\n\nAlthough an  intellectual rigor free zone, my friend and I found  a pretty pleasant space for people who seem somewhat reality challenged. Employees were all very friendly. Things were well laid out. It was sort of fun to browse. \n\nAnyway, whether you're really into this ineffectual crap or just looking for some shits 'n' giggles, if you're down by the market, head a bit south on Lower Jarvis and pop in.
