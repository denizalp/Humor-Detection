This place is amazing. I have taken my dog previously to Pete and Macs and will never go back. After going to Born To Run I would have to say my dog is treated like a family member, the owner Kim knows every dog by first name and treats them like her own. Whenever I bring Kobe here for day care he comes home sooo tired and I actually get to rest at night without him being all over the place. \n\nI would highly recommend Born To Run to anyone out in the Gilbert area of Arizona, I have found each day that my dog has gone there amazing. The first time I went there to bring Kobe, I felt like a bad dog dad leaving him alone ( I felt like a dad dropping off there kid at day care for the first time), but now he goes 2 times a week and I feel like such a good dog dad knowing my dog is in the best care possible with amazing caring people playing with him and other dogs.
