Chicken on the way is located in the corner of Kensington Road NW, you really can't miss it!!  I must admit, I have these weird cravings.  I've been craving some crispy greasy chicken alot lately and I've driven past Chicken on the way multiple times but when I first mentioned Chicken on the way to Spence, his response was \"Yuck!\"  So after a while I kept avoiding it and avoiding it, not thinking anything of it.  \n\nSo after 4 years of living in Calgary, I FINALLY gave Chicken on the way a try.  I went against Spence's \"Yuck\" and tried it one night after a yoga class at Beyond yoga.  It wasn't far but I did go out OUT OF THE WAY to try Chicken on the way! (haha)  It was about 9:45PM and I was the only one in the parking lot.  When I walked in, I was winded by the smell of greasy goodness.  After reading other reviews, I went with the 2 piece chicken with fries and a corn frit to go.  It was ready RIGHT AWAY!! I paid $6.50 and walked right out ... it was pretty fast!\n\nI set the bag on my passenger seat, and started driving.  As I drove, I really couldn't help myself, so I reached over AT A RED LIGHT (no distracted driver for me :P) and grabbed some fries. MMMM MMMM, nice hot crispy fries with skin on them and just enough salt!  When I got home, I dug into the bag, took the small yellow box out and went in for the chicken. MMM AHHH, so delicious!!  The skin on the chicken was extra crispy..just the way I like it, the meat was juicy, the fries were still nice and hot, and the corn frit was tasty!  The corn frit was a little dry, but still hot with a slight crisp.  I took a bite and you can see pieces of corn inside.  It was good, but nothing to rave about though.  I'm sure the freshest ones are the best.  The chicken and fries were the main event!\n\nI'd say, it's worth going out of your way to stop at chicken on the way!! :)
