So finally decided do true TRAIL run session and my friends that do trail running all the time told me McCullough Hills is good one. Me more of road runner training for triathlons or marathons. I understand the benefits of trail running higher elevation, more climbing, and solid workout on the legs. I needed do 10miles on the training schedule. The way trails set up for first timer nice and easy five miles out and back. They have few trails that can mix things up add more difficulty and really once at top just another spectacular view of the valley. The one I did was the main path out towards anthem hills (it complete opposite end but either side has base starting point for the trails). Or you can do Sloan Canyon trail from the base of McCullough. So really there no way can get bored with the routes from climbing or distance. One thing make sure pay attention depending on the time of the year and day. The trail has snakes. So be conscious of them.\n\nThe paths especially the main ones nice and wide so whether someone on bike, running, or hiking enough room pass. It such popular trail everyone respects it and keep it clean. At the base really like the clean area with bathrooms, map of couple of the trails, rules of the trails, water fountain, and one picnic table with cover so once done can chill in the shade. \n\nWarning the address on this is WAY WAY off. I ended up driving around neighborhood with no end in sight. Forget the direction. The true address 271-289 W Mission Dr. Henderson, NV 89044. \n\nIf looking to take break from Vegas not looking for long drive. McCullough Hills Trails is the perfect spot for training, relaxing, and once get top the views is amazing.
