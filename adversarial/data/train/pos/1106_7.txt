This review is based on my personal experience \n\nWorse strip club I've ever been to. Don't come here if you're black and especially if you're a couple it's a complete waist of time. \n\nMy boyfriend and I got scammed into coming here by a taxi driver who had cards for free drinks and sold us a dream of how much fun it would be. Entry wasn't a problem but once we got in all the girls were avoiding our table like a plague. Finally the server came to us she explained it was because we were a couple and that the girls avoid couples at all costs. A dancer also approached me later on and suggested it was because were black as well and most of the dancers stereotype blacks as if we don't tip.
