I've been waiting two years for my hair to grow out into a perfect LOB (long bob). After getting burned by so many different stylists in the area, I finally waited for Hollys hair coloring advice. It took 5 months to get my hair to the right length because I had uneven layers looking like a asian mullet situation. After my hair appointment last week Holly worked her magic and my hair looks longer and I walked out feelin' like a million bucks! \n\nThe color was brought up higher and my hair looks sun-kissed. She used Joico hair color, toner, and matrix shampoos so it definitely  made a difference. She also took care of myself & another patron we had snacks and complimentary water, plus girlchat. I LOVE my new medium length balyage thanks holly! She's the best in terms of hair coloring & I wont go anywhere else!
