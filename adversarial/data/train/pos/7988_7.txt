No. No. No. And just. N. O. \nNo smoke in the meat.... No flavor. \nDaughter got the pulled pork sandwich. Again-- no flavor. Sauce was lacking full body.....????? Where did this place come from?\nI got the pulled pork \"nachos\".... And if you call Nachos--- chips swimming in cheap cheese sauce with little else--- well, then that's what I got. \nThe chips were soggy upon arriving home (less than 3 miles away).... Yuk. \nKnowing the portions\/measurements now since owning my own place-- I dare say there was 3 oz of meat in them. And that's being generous. \nPathetic really. They came in that spot and obviously is corporate owned. Why not do it right??? They've got the money to back it. Esthetically they transformed the little location fabulously. But who cares about that?? \nUse some spice rub in that meat--- and salt\/pepper go a long way too! \nFrom a previous visit, My daughter also said the Mac n cheese had no flavor as well. \nWell, there's obviously a market for lack luster, tasteless food and the Falls has hit it!!!! \nSorry guys. I will continue to make my own food at home that's DA BOMB.
