This is not the Ben & Jerry's I've come to know and love.  It is pretty close but I think Ben or Jerry may have tied one on last night and the service and execution is slightly off.  So what could have been a 5 star chocolate shake comes out kind of runny and only a four star shake.\n\nWhen a star falls in Vegas does it make a sound?
