When I left this club, I ended up asking myself, \"Why didn't I go to Spearmint Rhino?\" \nOh yea....because I had so much fun with a group of men who purchased the bottle service. \n\nFor some reason, someone told me the Crazy Horse has the best looking and youngest women.........but I hope to God that's not true. Sure, some of the girls are young, but that doesn't really matter when they have ratchet hair, nails, and makeup. \n\nI'm not crazy in thinking that there are naturally pretty strippers out there, right? I mean, if you're paying for a lap dance, it should be for a woman that you find attractive, in the least. \n\nOnly a few of the white and black women had skills on the pole.....and they definitely got their money. The DJ is wack and so are the bouncers. Plus, this strip club is HUGE and they only had ONE room open. L A M E. \n\nAt least I can say I went once......
