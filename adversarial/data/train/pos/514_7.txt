I saw that this Habit recently opened, and I decided to stop in for a bite to eat on the way home from work.  \n\nFirst of all, if you have read my other Habit reviews, you know I love the damn place.  Fell in love with the original one up in Goleta, and have always been a big fan.  I stopped by this new one tonight to grab a salad.  \n\nIf you have never had it, I would highly recommend the Santa Barbara Cobb Salad.  It is fucking awesome!  Shredded lettuce, tomato, egg, bacon, blue cheese, chicken, avocado and their creamy dressing.  By far my favorite salad of all time.  Always consistent, always delicious, and not too pricey for the size of the thing ($8.00 or so)!  I am not really a \"salad person\", but this thing is beyond great.  I could eat this every single day and never get tired of it.  Go get yourself one, stat! \n\nService was incredibly personable and friendly.  The cashier was all smiles, looked everyone dead in the eyes, made ordering easy, and even offered me a cup for water while I waited for my salad.  A lot of fast casual restaurants have bumps on a log for their front facing employees and they just sit there stone faced and show no emotional connection to their customers.  Not the Habit! I have always encountered really good service at all the ones I have been to.  This one is no exception.  This lady was awesome!  \n\nI am happy that they built one here!  It's now the closest one to my house in Surprise, and I'm sure I will be stopping by quite often.  Keep up the awesomeness, Habit!  Love you guys!
