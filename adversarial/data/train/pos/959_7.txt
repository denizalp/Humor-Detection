Must say right from the start...HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE. First off you call a corporate office to talk to an operator who hates you to beg them to come do a pool inspection for a home I am buying due to my home inspector finding issues. Now that you have begged an appointment  time you get told that tomarrow if they get to it a email will be sent out to the local guy. Then sometime between 7 and 9 am he will make his weekly schedule and call us to inform us of the magical date and time he might just show up. Plus there is the $90 house call fee. HOUSE CALL FEE...WHERE ELSE ARE YOU GOING TO FIND A PERSONAL POOL? YOU ARE A POOL COMPANY WHO CHARGES A HOUSE CALL FEE SINCE I AM UNABLE TO DIG IT UP AND BRING IT TO YOU! With that said we later called back and canceled. That was a nut roll. They spelled my wife's name wrong miss typed her phone number and could not find our house since it was listed in Alabama no Arizona. These people do not care about you or your pool. Look up my review at Island Life Pool and Spa if you want an outstanding company helping you. \n\nEverthing that I listed above is 100% true and happened today.
