I'm so excited there's a shabu shabu place in town and only a block from my office!  Some friends and I went for dinner and we shared a bunch of items.  Unlike other places I've been, they do individual mini hot pots at your seat but all the toppings come in a large enough size that you can share with a few people to get more variety and have the communal dining experience.  They also have an awesome dipping sauce bar where you can get as many dipping sauces as you like and mix different combinations.  As for their hot pot ingredients, there are a wide range of veggie, fish and meat options, including more exotic things like pigeon intestines (I did not select that).  We had a few veggie, fish and meat options and everything seemed of good quality and a decent price for what you get.  The service was also very prompt and friendly and they were happy to explain how things worked.  I also liked that all the tables had a bbq setup in the middle where you can cook your own korean style bbq.  I'll definitely go back again.
