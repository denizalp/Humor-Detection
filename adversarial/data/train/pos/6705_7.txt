So after a long week of trying pho in Pittsburgh, my friend who is married to someone who happens to be Vietnamese kept telling me to try Vietnam's Pho at the strip. She recommended this place because it's the most authentic. And I did...\n\nYou know it's all about that broth, right??? Oh my gosh... The unadulterated broth is delicious and amazing! In fact, I didn't need to add any sauce or spice to it. The add-ins were plentiful and I only needed one slice of pepper. Whereas other places I'd put all peppers and hot sauce to make it spicy. #9 is my favorite!\n\nThe fresh spring rolls with shrimp was so incredible and fresh served with a peanut dipping sauce. So fresh!\n\nThis is my definitely my go to spot for pho! I just love this place. I'm interested in trying out their sandwiches, boba, and other drinks next time.
