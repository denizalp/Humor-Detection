My first time to an AYCE in Las Vegas and I'm impressed. I opted for a la carte because I can never eat my money's worth at buffets but my folks went with AYCE. Their a la carte menu is quite extensive as is their AYCE menu. The fish was super fresh. My favorite was the super white tuna and my mom loved the uni. \n\nGood service too. The server was friendly and attentive and food came out very quickly! \n\nLunch AYCE is $21.95 and Dinner AYCE is $26.95. Not bad at all.
