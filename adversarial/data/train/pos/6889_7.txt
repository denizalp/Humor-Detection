What's not to love? \n\nThe food is classic American-Style Italian.. great little guy running around playing his music on an accordion..and most of the staff has been there a very long time.. 20-40 years in some cases. it is very inexpensive, filling, and always a good time. Please check it out and ask fr Luigi! He will take care of you and has been there almost as long as the restaurant itself!
