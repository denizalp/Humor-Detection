Chick-fil-a has made it to Henderson! 1 of 2 locations here in the Valley. This one is on Stephanie and Warm Springs, the other on Eastern. It's only the second day of its opening and it's pretty busy for sure. They've got their full menu. It's clean on the inside and full of tables and a jungle gym for the children. Of course they have their signature sauces (you can ask for whichever ones you want). My ultimate fave is the chick-fil-a sauce of course! They're most known for their chicken sandwich. I got the #1 and the honey got the #2. Their shakes are hand-spun and thick and delicious, and the waffle fries are hands down da bomb! Definitely try it if you haven't before. They have so much to try on their menu.
