You had me at Hoegaarden and lamb vindaloo pasty.  I came in here a little drunk from cheap drinking at Ra and was starving!  My friend and I looked over the menu, and couldn't decide between which pasty to get.  Luckily, the waiter was extremely patient with us and even helped us decide on which one to get.  We ended up with the lamb vindaloo and the chicken alfredo.  It was only a short wait until our pasties arrived.  They were huge!  Way more than enough for two people.  Both were extremely delicious and flavorful, and I loved the sauces that came with them.  I would definitely recommend getting different pasties so you can split them up and share them.  Great food at a great price!  I love this place!
