I normally get my hair done @ my friends place where she turned her basement into a home salon. The fact that my birthday is fast approaching, I thought to myself why not pamper myself w\/ a professional hair colour @ a recognized salon. So then I booked an appointment to get my hair coloured by Catherine.\n\nMy appointment was scheduled for June 7th @ 6:15. I was running late due to the fact that I was coming from richmond hill & was stuck in traffic. I called to inform them that I was running late. The receptionist? What she told me was that normally they don't take customers in after being 15mins late but she still allowed me to come down. So I did the hectic commute from richmond hill to mississauga. I arrived @ 6:45 pm being 30 mins late thinking that I was still able to get my hair done. \n\nBy the time I got there, Catherine was just finishing up with a client. I waited a few minutes for her until she approached me. She introduced herself & asked me what I wanted to do with my hair.  All I said was I wanted my hair to be coloured a full solid brown colour. Mind you I have some blonde on my hair that is growing out. She then wasted a few minutes of my time explaining the process it will take to get my hair coloured one solid colour & that she won't be able to do my hair. As mad as I was..I just got up & walked away from the store. \n\nWhat upsets me more is that the receptionist knew that I was running late but yet she allowed me to travel all the way there to only be turned down. I'm also upset @ the fact that when I got to the salon that Catherine girl was still working on someone else's hair so me being late wasn't the factor at all yet she kept saying how late I was for my appointment. Because of the poor service I received from this place, I never want to get my hair done from this location. That is why I also canceled a hair appointment that I was scheduled for couple of days ago. Time wasted is time I'll never get back!
