Loved it! The dinosaur exhibits are great. I wanted EVERY GEM in the gem room. Hey, Carnegie family, how about giving me that diamond and platinum bracelet? Even a loaner would be fine. The discovery room is comfortable and friendly, and we got to pet a stuffed (dead) bear. We saw lots of stuffed (dead) animals, the camel tableaux is shocking. It reminded me of the California Academy of Science in SF, the way it was before they remodeled and screwed it all up. If I'm back in Pittsburgh, I'd go back again. It's kid friendly, people friendly, and a beautiful museum.
