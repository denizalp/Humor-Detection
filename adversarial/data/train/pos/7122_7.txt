Up until last week, the only ramen I ever had was the kind in a cup. I was in the mood for soup last week and decided to hit up Jinya as its right down the street from work. I went in and there were a lot of people waiting. The dining room is pretty small. I asked how long the wait was but the hostess had no idea. I only get an hour lunch break so I had to leave. I am not sure if they take reservations, I think it is first come first serve, so be advised.  \n\nI decided to go back a few days later and luckily there was no wait. I sat at the big family sized table right in the middle of the restaurant. This table seats at least 20 people, so if you don't mind eating in front of strangers then you are good to go.  They do have a few smaller tables that border the large table, but they were all full. \n\nAnyways I sat down and was given a menu. I already knew what I wanted, and that was the Tonkotsu Assari. It took a good 25 minutes to come out. When it finally came out I slurped myself into a ramen oblivion. It was very good and filling. Unfortunately this type of meal has loads and loads of sodium, so it is probably best to just have occasionally. It is tempting to go everyday when the weather is cold though! The service was good and the waitress was nice. Packaged ramen you can suck it! There is a new sheriff in town.\n\nYelp 2015 Review #6
