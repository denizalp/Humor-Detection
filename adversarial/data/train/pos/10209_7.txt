I came here with my Sunday date guy, and I had a good time.  It was late, and we wanted something simple.  We ended up coming here because it was open, and neither of us had been here before.\n\nI liked the fact that Sunday, from 4-10 is half off everything!  The entire menu!!!  We had a great meal there, and it cost us $14.50.  Loved it!
