Wow, I'm baffled at how NOT helpful their staff is. \n\nI just purchased an HDTV, and figured it would be safer (albeit a little more expensive) to deal with direct handling at a brick & mortar store instead of possible online shipping damages. \n\nThere are plenty of staff members walking around checking their phones, but don't ask them for help with carrying your items because they'll find an excuse to run away. \nAfter lugging the 50+ pound TV by myself onto the cart, I rolled it into the parking lot, only to find that it wouldn't fit into my compact car. \n\nI went back in to see if any of the staff members had any ideas on how to carry this TV home, and all they suggested was \"go get a bigger car.\" \nWow, thanks Sherlock. Let me just go fly my G6 onto your loading dock. \n\nI proceed to ask about their \"free delivery\" option that I saw online (proof: http:\/\/www.bestbuy.com\/site\/55-class-54-5-8-diag--led-1080p-120hz-smart-hdtv\/8816483.p?id=1218901344739&skuId=8816483&st=samsung%2055%22%20hdtv&cp=1&lp=1#tab=overview), \nDarien said \"no, we charge for delivery.\" \nMind you, I have an HDTV unsupervised in a parking lot so I'm not looking to linger.\nI don't have time to argue with your ignorance and I'm beyond frustrated at this point. \nAs a last resort, I ask if they have any supplies that I can use to rig the tv onto the top of my car? \n\"no, we don't want to be held liable.\"\n\nI ended up taking the TV out of the box (say goodbye to returns) but fortunately it worked out. \nF YOU best buy, but THANK YOU to all the kind Scottsdale strangers who helped me carry the TV into my car and making helpful suggestions. \nNever going back to BB for the rest of my life.
