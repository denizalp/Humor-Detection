Let's start by saying it's in a great location.   However, it has a couple minor downfalls.\n\nNot sure why it takes 2 elevators to get to the rooms when the hotel only has 6 floors.  I mean, I get it, they have to account for the garage, but seems silly for this size hotel.\n\nI saw the train was mentioned by some other yelpers, but I didn't think it was horrible especially when we come from Chicago.  I actually thought it was a photogenic view from the room.\n\nThe bathroom light in the room is directly connected to the exhaust fan, and the fan is kind of loud and annoying.  This bothered me more the the trains.\n\nSince it's in a really good spot near their marina and some of their touristy bars it worked for us.  It wasn't great, but good location goes a long way.
