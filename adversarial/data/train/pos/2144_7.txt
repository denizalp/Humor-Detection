Went here today for first time. Can't figure out what all The hypes about? It's an expensive basic chicken sandwich. I'll stick with Canes.\nSandwich, fries and drink was $10.\nTraffic around place and lines are still long after 3 weeks. Workers are very pleasant. This location has 175 employees so very good for economy gotta give them credit for that.
