Anytime you use beets in your strawberry cupcakes and I can't even taste them, I am down for the cause.  Jewell Treats has opened their 2nd location in uptown Charlotte in the Hearst building, right beside Showmars.  If you've ever tried her cupcakes at the Southpark location, you know she uses natural ingredients for coloring, etc., for some of the yummiest, healthy cupcakes around.  Give them a try if you're in the uptown area.
