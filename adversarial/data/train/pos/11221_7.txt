If for any reason (8 year old nephew's birthday party) you HAVE to go to Laser Quest, this one is not bad. Compared to the location up North (9 year old nephew's birthday party) this one is cleaner, nicer, and generally better run. Birthday parties cost $17 per kid, and they get two Laser Tag games. You also get access to a decent party room where you can order pizza in etc. Too scary for the little ones, but the (boys mostly) ages 7 and up really love it.
