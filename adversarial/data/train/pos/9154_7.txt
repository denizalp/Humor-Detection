In honor of the original long haired hippie in sandals, who preached peace and love; i went on a three part Free Range Easter Egg hunt of the west side. Stop one was Treehugger's. I've cruised up and down Bagley road countless times looking for it based on word of mouth. I finally looked up the actual address which resides some two miles west of campus in the middle of nowhere. That is probably my only complaint. Rent must be cheaper.\n\nThe menu was amazing. So many vegan options. I finally had choices beyond just the grilled cheese. I ended up getting a grilled cheese. So to speak. It was a grilled eggplant panini with buffalo mozzerella. Is that cheese like the hot shit now? Cause i see it everywhere. It also had a zippy basil pesto. The bread was not very thick or crisp, but most likely locally produced, so it gets passing marks. There were four burger options available. A burger would be too heavy at noon, hence cheese sandwich.\n\n The fries were kind of limp like the ones i make at home. The expertly light seasoning made them worth eating, though. I guess after a lifetime of eating fast food fries, i forgot what good food should actually taste like. i added a Queen Conch iced coffee that was a perfect pick me up on a sunny afternoon.\n\nTotal was around 14 clams. A buck or two steep, but considering the care they take in being so damn green and supporting other local businesses, i can live with it. The bakery also offers many vegan goodies. Now that i know where it is, i will def stop in any time i'm down in Berea.
