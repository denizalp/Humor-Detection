Surprisingly this it he first time I've ever been to a walk-in and this experience makes me question I want  my family doctor. \n\nI was referred to here by my family doctor who wasn't available on a weekend. With a short form to fill, and no line up, I was screened with my issue. Soon after the doctor came in, and immediately knew what to give me. \nSeems to make sense, and straightforward, not sure why my family doctor has dismissed it as something else. \n\nIt's right beside the Shoppers which is convenient for 'scripts.
