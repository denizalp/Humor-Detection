How could I go from a 5 star to a 1 star let me tell you. Officer Larrimore. Pray you don't get this jerk. I was already pulling into the mall parking lot on the left side when he flashed his lights and got on the loud speaker and told me to pull over on the right side of the road? Does that make sense to pull back on the roadway where cars are, across 4 lanes of traffic when I am in the turning lane? Well anyways it gets much better. Officer Larrimore was a complete jerk and treated me like a criminal for having window tint on my car. He talked down to me like I was special needs . I am a Gilbert resident with no criminal history and he made me feel like I was the scum of the earth. I understand now why the perception of police is the way it is. Its police like Officer Larrimore that give the good ones a bad name. Gilbert please do a better job of putting police officers in our town that are humans and treat people with respect. I would suggest taking a video of officer Larrimore if you get pulled over by him you may need it.
