Oh my, HELL no!!!!\nThe owner is horrible!!!!!\nThey have posted, walk ins welcome...we walked in and the owner was so rude, she never acknowledged us when we walked in...\nWe came in with 4 sisters for a pedicure and we sat at the stations and with water running, the owner walked back and grabbed the techs and said, these people didnt have an appointment and therefore are not a priority...\n\nShe was rude to everyone, her poor employees.\nWhen we were finished and went up to pay she got mad that we didn't know the name of the techs and she was pissed...\nShe then got mad when I wanted change to leave a tip..\n\nShe was rude and with so many other nail places in town I can guarantee that we will NOT go back.\n\nThe techs were great and had a great treatment...but the owner got so rude and horrible!
