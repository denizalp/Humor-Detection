Although I ordered my burger medium, it came out dry and tasteless. The topping list is great, but as many have mentioned the extra charges here border on ridiculous . When I'm order $6 worth of fries\/onion rings you can't throw in some sauce for free?\n\nThe shake we created (for $5.49 mind you) was really delicious, but I haven't met a shake I didn't love!! \n\nA decent burger, but with LBS, Burger Bar, Strip Burger, In n Out, BLT, etc all in our fair city it's hard for me to get excited for this place !
