Love that I can drop in here and pick up a lunch for mere $4,.25 $3.50 bagel sandwich and $0.75 Jacobson Potato Salad. \n\nThe employees are extremely nice here and helpful. \n\nWith your sandwich you can choose premium toppings such as sprouts, freshly sliced cucumbers,  peppers, onions,  and tomato for no charge. The only extra is the guacamole. \n\nI'd definitely recommend this place to pick up sammies for the road our a picnic, or whatever excuse for a cheap lunch!
