Would never go to Red Mountain again! Girls were very nice! Was suppose to get a blood test when I started never went to get it and no one ever checked or asked if I did it! Stopped going after 3 weeks no one ever called to see why I never went back! After 480.00 for one month I feel someone should of called to see why I didn't go back!  I only saw a doctor once never saw one again in 3 weeks I want my money back !!!!!
