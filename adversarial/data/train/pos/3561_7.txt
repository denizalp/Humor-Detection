It was nice to eat at this local restaurant and walk around downtown afterwards.  It was our very visit here.  The atmosphere and decor created a great first impression.  The menu offers many appealing choices.  It was difficult to decide what to order.  \n   Our server was knowledgeable of the menu. She even altered the preparation of one of my sides to accommodate me.  Our food came out in a reasonable amount of time.  It was perfectly cooked and delicious.  I got the steak tacos with pita chips.  I ordered a side of roasted seasoned brussel sprouts.  They were amazing.  My wife and daughter split a grilled chicken sandwich with fries and a side of saut√©ed green beans.  The green beans were really good.  \n    This place appeared very clean.  The staff is friendly.  The food is good.  I would recommend eating here.
