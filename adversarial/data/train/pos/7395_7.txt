The cinnamon tasted, well, brown.\n\nMy husband, being the foodie of the family, used me having a bad day as an excuse to give Sprinkles a shot. We filed bankruptcy shortly after, as he bought four for the two of us, at $3.50 a cake. Its against my religion to spend that much on an individual serving, unless it contains alcohol.\n\nThe first one I had one was chocolate cake and a mocha icing, and it was pretty dry and not much flavor. The icing was the best part, the cake was a distant second. \n\nThe second one (right, like you save cupcakes for later. There is no later.), was one with a cinnamon icing and and I'm-not-exactly-sure cake. I was really excited for the icing and I was super disappointed, because instead of tasting cinnamon, I tasted brown. Sandy brown. That's the only way I know how to describe it. Not bad for a paint color, but not good for icing. The cake was even worse, really crumbly and dry. I ate half. What does that tell you? Half a cupcake. Who does that? \n\nHaven't been back to try them again and I probably won't. I've had Lulu's and I have to say, that if Lulu and Sprinkle went at it in the Octagon, it'd be all Lulu, all night.
