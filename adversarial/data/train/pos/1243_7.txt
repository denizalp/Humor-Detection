You should try Pints on Penn! You haven't tried Pints on Penn because you didn't know it existed but now you do...so try Pints on Penn!\n\nThey have a nice variety of beer, which is not for me but my eating partner was very satisfied. I thought the beer cocktails were really cool and I would have tried one if I didn't get obsessed with the Watermelon Ginger drink! It had fresh watermelon and ginger beer. It was really great.\n\nWe order 3 apps that were really good!\nBrown Sugar Bacon- 5 fat strips of bacon all covered in brown sugar with a mapley cayenne dipping sauce= win!\nStuffed zucchini- super fresh veggirs stuffed a home grown zuke. It was topped in cheese snd served with marinara. It was good but I wanted some sausage stuffed in there!\nStffed avocados- This was my fav! The avocado was grilled and stuffed with a corn salsa. The ingredients were supper fresh and the chips were homemade. I loved!\n\nWe didnt get a chance.ro try the entrees. During HH, the apps are $2 off and beer is $1 off!
