After work on Friday I was looking forward to doing a little gambling and enjoying a few cocktails at the Fiesta Rancho.  I hadn't been there for awhile and figured it might be nice to be reminded why I liked the Fiesta Rancho. I started out in the Cabo Lounge with four deuces and two Budweisers and moved on when someone started smoking next to me. \n\nI sat down at an Alien machine near bingo and put in a $20 from my winnings. I proceeded to lose the entire $20 in short order. I sat at the machine waiting for a cocktail waitress (one hadn't come because I lost my money so quickly). \n\nJosefina finally came around the corner asking for cocktail orders. I ordered a Corona. She said, \"are you going to be playing?\" \n\nI replied, \"I just lost $20.\"\n\nShe stuck to her script and said, \"I was in the area and did not see you at the machine.\"\n\nI said, \"I'd like to speak to your manager.\"\n\nI waited for a good 12 minutes for Josefina to return before I noticed she was at the cocktail station chatting away with another coworker. I started to think, 'she didn't see me in her station because she REALLY takes her time doing her job.' She didn't think that during the time she was socializing in her work station that I could have lost $20. \n\nNeedless to say the manager did not show and I did not get a beer that has a cost of somewhere around $0.89.  Now that's customer service!\n\nMoving forward, I'd like the Fiesta Rancho to know I will be frequenting the South Point because their waitresses likely give the benefit of the doubt to the customer.
