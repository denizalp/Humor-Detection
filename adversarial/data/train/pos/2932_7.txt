I was so pleased with Out-U-Go. I contacted Lisa to housesit my dog and cat while I was out of town. I find it easier to have my pets stay in my home together.  She was prompt to respond to my requests and questions via email. She came to meet the pets, myself and get the lay of the land. She is very professional and friendly. My pets (and I) warmed to her immediately. I felt very comfortable with her staying and caring for them in my home.  She sent updates while I was gone. I would not hesitate to hire Out-U-Go again.
