Considering the amount of revenue Target generates from me on a _____-ly basis (sorry, I can't tell you how much I shop here because I know you will pass judgement), I have to say I am pretty surprised I have not yet received my notice that I am a majority shareholder for the company. \n\nGiven that this particular Target is conveniently located on my way home from work, I can usually justify having to make a pit stop the same way I can justify \"needing\" to buy all of the things I leave with. \n\nI've been to this store a zillion and a half times and I still go down aisle by aisle to find new things that, again, I \"need.\" Except maybe the baby and pet sections because anyone who spends the kind of exorbitant amount of time in a Target like I do is clearly not responsible enough to take care of anyone else at this point in her life.
