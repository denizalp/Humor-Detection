Above and beyond, the best challah in the Valley!\n\nYou can purchase it straight from the source (Miss Miriam Litzman herself),  and you can now purchase it at Imperial Kosher Bakery as well.\n\nI've been purchasing this doughy goodness straight from the source for quite some time now... I usually pick it up on Fridays and go the frozen route, and then defrost and cook it in the comfort of my own home.  I've also purchased it baked and ready-to-go.  Neither option disappoints.  I've gone both the whole wheat, white, and raisin route.  White no raisins is the favorite in our house, but I prefer the whole wheat.  Regardless of the kind, everyone that has \"broken bread\" at my house, from my husband and kids to my parents, in-laws, and grandparents, has raved about this challah!\n\nYou're in for a treat with Oven Fresh Challah no matter what, but the special round challahs for rosh hashanah are hella (I mean holla) incredible.  Don't miss the babka either.  Just don't buy her out... we look forward to these challahs every week!
