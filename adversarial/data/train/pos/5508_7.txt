Boyfriend decided he needed a hair cut for an important job interview, so we popped in here. \n\nThe front desk girl with multi-colored hair was rather unpleasant.... reminded me of an eye-rolling, gum-snapping teenager with her attitude. I would have ignored it, except that she chose to take his info, then look at my hair (which was lavender at the moment, don't ask) and with a disdainful look say \"Just one of you?\"   \n\n... B****.\n\nThey took him right back and I ventured into Tempe Marketplace, but when I returned 45 minutes later, they were STILL working on his hair. It was supposed to be a simple trim of the front \"emo style\" piece and the \"mullet\" in the back - that's a LONG time to take for that.\n\nIt wasn't a good job either - he ended up with a top layer that looked like a bowl cut, with random vertical pieces taken out. He was not pleased..
