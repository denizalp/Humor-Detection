Purchased a Serra mattress and moving bed frame- it's awesome!!! It's very handy to be able to prop it up and watch TV. Also use the zero G mode to help relieve stress on body spine and joints when it's time to sleep. Kendrick was very helpful and willing to go the extra mile- positive attitude and very thorough knowledge about the products!
