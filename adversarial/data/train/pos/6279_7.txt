Most affordable = most unreliable and disappointing. I would NEVER recommend this company to anyone. They did not live up to their contract and we had the worst service from them and their rookie videographer from the day after we paid them in full until the day we received our horrible quality video a month late (we were also promised a digital copy which we have yet to receive 6 months post-wedding). Do yourself a HUGE favor and pay a little more for infinitely better quality. Rebecca is a horrible person who never returns emails and actually goes out of her way to mock you if you send perfectly reasonable emails for a video ETA.  And to give an idea, this is the only review I have given less than 5 stars for a wedding vendor. This company should be out of business in no time. Check them off in the BBB reports and the \"rip off report\"
