i spent $8 something on a 16oz fresh pressed juice...  ummmm even wholefoods market doesn't charge that much!\n\nprobably had better chances giving the slots at the airport my money than jamba, but i picked the latter.  lol.\n\nmy green juice was good, since i was feeling fiber deficient from all the not so healthy food i ingested all wkend.\n\nbut this will be the only time i'll subject my wallet to jamba at the airport.  never again.
