I'm very unhappy because someone stole my wallet today, and just two weeks ago maybe the same person stole my shoes with my leather jacket .\nAnd seems like the stealer is always there, but nobody care. I told the manager what happened and they looks like not really care about that and tell me \"you call the police but we can't help you\"  very bad experience, Macy's is not a safe place to shop and bad customer service.
