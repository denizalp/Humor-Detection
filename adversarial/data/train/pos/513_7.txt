Hitting Mekong last night to try all the new restaurants we started here because they have Mi Bo Kho (beef stew with egg noodles), one of my favorites. So we ordered that as well as the egg rolls.. we almost started laughing when the egg rolls come out.. they were served with 2 pathetic pieces of warm iceberg lettuce and no herbs.. wtf?! While the rolls and the fish sauce tasted good they were greasy and without the romaine and herbs, ordinary.  \n\nThe Mi Bo Kho arrived.. I was surprised to see about a half inch of oil on the top of the stew, I like some oil content but this was ridiculous! The stew tasted like it was made from a base and not from scratch.. had this weird fake beef taste. The meat was so fatty and not very well cooked. The meat was so stringy that it got caught between my teeth. \n\nWe finished sharing the dishes.. what a complete disappointment.. don't worry Da Vang, they have nothing on you!
