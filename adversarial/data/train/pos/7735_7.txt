I love astronaut cows! So cute! So cute and DELICIOUS!\n\nSo I had no clue what to expect from Holsteins, was it going to be amazing like Gordon Ramsay's BurGR or disappointing like Burger Bar. However, I read in their description about how they are all organic and I had to give this place a try!\n\nFirst off, the decor is really modern with colorful drawings of the astronaut cows. Very chic and modern, pretty much the standard at the Cosmo. Here were a couple of things we ordered:\n\nGold standard- 4\/5- Really solid burger. The bacon blended perfectly with the sirloin patty.\n\nRising Sun- 4.5\/5- This burger is an amazing combination of kobe beef with tempura avocado. Super tasty.\n\nSmores milk shake- 4\/5- This shake was amazing! However, it was dang expensive, $13 for a small shake! However, a little indulgence never hurts.\n\nOverall, our hostess was super nice. However, they seemed to be understaffed and I had to yell out to them to get their attention. I would rank this place miles above burger bar but under Gordon Ramsay's.
