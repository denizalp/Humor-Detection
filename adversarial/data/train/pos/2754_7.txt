All around great place!-from the atmosphere & interior decor-to the customer service & staff. It was my first time visiting & It's very bright & cozy from the moment you walk in! Amongst other things-They carry all middle eastern groceries with a large variety of brands to choose from- including dairy items, produce, sweets & Canned\/pre-packaged products.\nNot to mention the ready to order fresh made food to go, for on the spot goodness ( falafel, sandwiches, meat\/spinach pies, kabobs, ect.) or catered trays for takeout\/parties. Large selection of fresh, homemade sweets & desserts also! & They even have an in-house butcher that's there & ready to cut up what ever you'd like on the spot. - oh & they also carry all necessary hookah supplies & accessories (also plenty tobacco flavors & brands to choose from)   That's always a plus! Its a newer a family owned\/run business & everyone working was very pleasant in answering all my questions & making sure I was able to find what I was looking for. I noticed employees helping customers carry bags\/load groceries on several occasions & not just pointing ppl. In the right direction of where to find something...but actually walking w.them & reviewing brands, prices ect. If they'd asked for something in particular. To me, that's sincere quality customer service. It's those sort of gestures that make a difference! I'll definitely return.
