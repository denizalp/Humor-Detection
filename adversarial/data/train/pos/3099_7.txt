Salad and Go is a DRIVE THREW with a WALK UP Window. NO INSIDE DINING. You either drive threw or order at the walk up window. On the website they note that EVERYTHING meats, salad dressings, etc is made in house and is natural and ORGANIC. Salad and Go offers over TEN types of salads that can be made into wraps, Breakfast, Soup, Smoothies and More. They offer a DOG Friendly patio and on my visit teated my dogs to Biscuits.\n\nI tried the Apple and Mixed Greens Salad with added Chicken. My salad contained Mixed Greens, Romaine, Golden Raisins, Candied Pecans, Apples, Blue Cheese and was tossed with House Made Balsamic Vinegar. The Chicken Breast Was well seasoned and seemed like it was baked in an oven earlier and was chilled and served cold.\n\nMy husband had a Santa Fe Salad with added Steak. He was very happy with his salad.\n\nPrices are low and portions are large. My salad was only $$5.74 plus $1.44 for the chicken. Steak runs $2.39 at this time.\n\nReally everything exceeded my expectations.\n\nAbove average and GREAT Value!
