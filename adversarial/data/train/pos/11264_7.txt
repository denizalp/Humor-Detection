I like this Saks! It is much better than Nordstrom in the same complex. It is also much better than the Saks in South Coast Plaza, people!!\n\nHandbag selection is pretty good here. There is both a Chanel and Louis Vuitton boutique. Prada has its own corner and there's always some nice Miu Miu bags on display. Coach collection is pretty sad, still.\n\nDecent shoe section as well- I saw 2 Chanel flats on sale today for $359!\n\nI also like the contemporary women's section, which is actually OUTSIDE of Saks proper on the 2nd floor. They have a pretty good selection of stuff (lotsa Juicy couture, designer jeans that take up entire corner, Theory, DVF, BCBG, etc). However, I don't see many good sales going on here. To me, the SA's have always been less than nice too.\n\nDo not be fooled- even though it's Cleveland and the economy is in the dump, I called the DAY OF a presale and was told everything was sold out! Gross.
