Great little find while coming up to Vegas! \n\nIt's your normal Filipino fast food style restaurant in a small market. Cramped to say the least. They sell goodies from the Philippines here, which is awesome for my little fobbish family haha! They do have a small fresh fish and meat department at the rear end of the store-alongside a fridge with some fresh Asian vegetables as well. \n\nThe food they sell here is not the best but they were pretty busy-so maybe I just picked the wrong dishes when I went. I shared a plate of BBQ pork belly and \"lechon paksiw\" with my mother and all was just extremely oily and bony, not too appetizing. They have a few tables and chairs set up here for dining. \n\nI'll probably be back again the next time I'm up in Vegas-the stores out here in San Diego don't sell the snacks they sell here at this store.
