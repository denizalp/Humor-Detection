Le Thai, I love you. I've had a meal in your restaurant every week since you opened and will continue to do so until I get completely burned out. Even though your pork pad prik, drunken noodles and pad thai are awesome, I feel the need to try every single dish on your menu. Today I went for the Thai style beef salad, which I very much enjoyed, especially since it is low cal and you only use oil to cook the beef (dressing primarily fish sauce I'm told). My problem is that most of your dishes are a good value, but this one was $8 and not very big. My advice to you is make it bigger or charge less. \n\nOne more bit of feedback - get some real iced tea. EVERY single time I'm there, I'm either with someone who wants iced tea or I hear someone try to order iced tea. All you offer is a sugary raspberry tea, which really isn't what you want to drink when you are eating spicy food. \n\nThanks for coming downtown. You've made lunchtime so much better.
