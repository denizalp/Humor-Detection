3 stars for A-OK is spot on for Coffee Island.  My cafe mocha was not bad, not outstanding.\n\nThe person making the coffee was painstakingly slow.  In the time it took him to make a mocha and a cappuccino his fellow employee went in the back and made a tasty croissant sandwich with fluffy egg, lots of cheese and some bacon.  Did I mention they make pretty good sandwiches?\n\nUnfortunately (for Coffee Island) the guy behind me was pretty irritated that it took like 10 minutes to get his coffee when they were not busy...just very slow making espresso drinks.\n\nI will definitely give Coffee Island another try.  Hopefully the new barista will develop some kind of routine or something.  He should go watch the folks at the two Coffee Rush locations...fastest  coffee guys in the west!
