Updating my review because my second experience here was much better! Good service and delicious food with very large portions (a rare thing for vegan places I feel). It seems like they have really improved and upped their standards since the last time I visited shortly after they had opened. This time I got a burrito, I don't recall what the name of it was, but black beans brown rice and fresh veggies served enchilada style..yummm. I also got the hummus as an appetizer and got to try some of the jalepe√±o Mac n cheese. Everything was yummy! I'll be back again!
