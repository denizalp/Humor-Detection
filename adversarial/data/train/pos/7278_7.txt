Friendly service, good portions, decent authentic Chinese food.  Highly recommend!  This little hole-in-the-wall has a very extensive menu spanning several different regional cuisines of China.  If you have a hard time deciding between the many different options, there are several different combination meals that will feed an army for a very good price.  We were in a spicy mood, so we ordered the Spicy Set Meal ($34.99), which included a large bowl of Tom Yum soup, 4 meat dishes (Satay pork, XO beef, water boiled fish, Szechuan chicken), and deep fried tofu in spicy oil.  Out of all the dishes, my favorite was the XO beef, which had a nice deep flavor with very tender beef.  The other meats were also very tender, and were actually not too spicy compared to the Tom Yum soup.  While the meat and the tofu was nicely cooked, the flavors of the dishes in general were just OK.   We finished all of our sizable bowl of soup, and attempted to eat our massive array of dishes, to find that even after eating as much as we could, it looked like we didn't even make a dent in any of the entrees! (A testament to the amount of food they give you in the combination meal)\n\nService was very prompt, and very friendly.  I'll definitely be coming back to try more of their dishes, especially the Hong Kong\/Cantonese style dishes vs. the Szechuan and other spicy style dishes I had this time.
