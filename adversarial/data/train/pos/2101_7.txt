Well, Lululemon is ridiculously pricey, I think we can all agree on that. \nTo be honest, I don't even know what possessed me to walk into the shop when I'm usually opposed to spending over $40 on pants, but I went in.\nand I bought a pair of the most comfiest pants\/capris I have ever worn and, if they didn't cost $100 a pop, I'd own the whole lot. \nBut this is of course a dangerous spot for us broke people and unlike most non-ridiculous-priced stores, this place has no \"sales\" section. \n\nI was bombarded by pretty much each employee when I went in, and as I walked through, after one person spoke to me, the next person would and the next and it was a bit annoying. \nBut, they were nice and helpful once I was in the fitting room, and having worked in retail before I totally understand where they are coming from but still-it's annoying as heck. \n\nThis is the first Lulu I've ever been in, but I get the feeling they're all pretty alike. \nGood location-a block east of Spadina right on Queen, so that's a plus. \n\nI don't even use my $100 capris to work out because they were so expensive...they're for everyday use and I highly recommend breaking the bank for a pair...only one pair though, because otherwise you'll own a bunch of lululemons but not make your rent and well then you'd be screwed.
