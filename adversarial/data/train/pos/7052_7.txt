First of all, thanks Roger for putting together this event.  It has been over 10 years since I have bowled.  And, Unfortunately, it showed.  I don't think I broke 100 in the first game.  I was the king of the gutter balls.  But, I did alright the 2nd game as I almost had 3 strikes in a row.  Good times!\n\nIt was great seeing some people that I have already met and a few faces that I see in my check-ins page.  It was an interesting night to say the least.  From, pro bowlers with kidney stones, novice bowlers wearing rented shoes, peeps just coming to hangout and have a few drinks, and a pimp with his \"girlfriends\".  One wearing heels while bowling.  I love Vegas!!\n\nWith all of that said, it was an absolute blast.  Next time, 2 games not 3 will be what the night will call for.  It became eternal - 10 pm to 2 am.  Gotta' love it.
