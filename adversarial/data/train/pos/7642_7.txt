Blake is the best, he was informative with how everything works and how long it'd be until all the ink is gone. I've done 4 sessions so far and the progress looks really good. The tattoo removal process was obviously painful but it's worth it when it's almost all gone. I'd definitely recommend because out of most places I've checked out, this place was the most professional and he knew exactly what he was doing.
