My friend and I came here for lunch on a Saturday afternoon. It wasn't busy at all and we were seated right away. \n\nI ordered the Mia pizza. Mozzarella, sausage, pepperoni, tomato sauce. It was good, but I was bummed they didn't have ranch of course. We also ordered the truffle fries to start which were good. The pizza was a pretty large size, so good to share. \n\nThe food was good, I was bummed they didn't have ranch and our waitress should be trained to be more sociable. She seemed like she didn't want to talk or smile at all. I thought it would've been busier for a Saturday. They do have a big menu though and also offer, breakfast\/brunch, and happy hour. They also have a pretty cute outdoor patio too.
