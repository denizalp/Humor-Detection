I was a little disappointed by the show as it had been so hyped up and I unfortunately had such high expectations.\n\nI think they get the crowd engaged really well before the show starts, and although there are really cool parts of the show, amazing acrobats, and great music and singing, the show was a bit too weird for me.\n\nI also didn't like how for the price you pay, the seats are so packed together, as the guy behind me kept kneeing the back of my chair throughout the experience.\n\nOverall, I much rather watch the free Bellagio water show outside.
