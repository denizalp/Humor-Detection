I came here for a new winter sweater.\n\nI left with a Vacuum, two down pillows, a movie, two Smart Waters, a pair of leggings and Laundry Detergent.\n\nWell played Target. Well played.\n\nBut in all honesty, super well kept, stocked, and staffed location. They had plenty of lines open for check out! \n\nKind of bummed about the sweater situation...
