One word: HATE\n\nThe staff sucks.. (except for Reuben). They are rude and think that they are way too good to serve you. I feel like I am not cool enough to shop there. Nothing but hipster jerks. The worst is Luis or whatever his name is.  Horrible customer service and makes zero eye contact when ringing you up.  Only reason I go from time to time is because it's so close to my home and I only spend less than 10 minutes there.  If I can find something and be in and out, it's better. They are WAY overpriced. I suggest Savers or Plato's Closet. \n\nBuffalo Exchange can eat my butt.
