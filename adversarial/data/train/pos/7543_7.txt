My mom grew up here and I've spent A LOT on and off the strip, so I have a special relationship with the town both as a sort of inside\/outsider.\n\nIf you don't live here, Vegas is great for about 24 hours and then it is just exhausting.  If you do live here, it's a struggle (unless you roll like Steven Wynn - and I don't even think he's got it all that easy).  \n\nBut regardless - Vegas is fun and Vegas has a spirit all it's own.  Maybe it's the modern Sodom and Gomorrah, maybe it's the collective Id letting out our wild pagan spirits - but Vegas is one hell of a town - no one can deny that.  I just wish it had retained some of the class it once had instead of accumulating all of its excessive grandiosity it's drowning in now.\n\nPeople who are from Vegas have a love\/hate relationship with their town.  They like the quirks, but hate the tourists.  They want to leave (a lot of them) but most of them stick around.  Vegas is a place of perpetual limbo - a world caught between absurd fantasy and stark reality.\n\nFor this reason, I rate Vegas squarely in the middle as there as many reasons to love Vegas as there are to hate it.  And given that most of the time the house sets the odds against you, I'd say giving it a 50\/50 is generous :)
