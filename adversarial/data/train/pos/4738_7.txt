BED BUGS!! As the other reviewers have mention, there are bed bugs in these rooms. Me & my gf booked this hotel as we both have stayed at other Travel Lodges. The room is very small and the walls are the same length. Making the room a box and feel very constricting & small. I booked through Hotels.com and the pictures were very misleading and used very exaggerated forced perspective to make the rooms seem larger than they were. I checked the mattress and there was a huge foot in diameter stain of something on the bed.\n\nWhen I checked in I was informed the room was ready, but had no towels and that they would be delivered shortly. And hour later and still no towels. I try to call the main office but the room phone was dead. Went down to the office and found another couple checking in. They were told the same thing that the room was ready except for towels. How can this whole motel be out of towels. \n\nI decided to check out within 2 hours of being here and go find a new hotel. I was not staying here for the night. Later that day me & my gf found a few bug bites on us.
