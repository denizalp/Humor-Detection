Currently staying here and I literally can't even. Our room was comped, but I definitely won't be back, nor do I recommend this hotel to anyone.\n\nIt's still under construction so there's that. The parking structure is super sketchy. It's not well lit and it's confusing as heck to get in to. I'm from Long Beach, and our structures are nicer than this. What the heck.\nWe had our room comp email and brought it to the front desk lady who told us that we had to book the room online and then come back. Basically she was saying she cannot even do her job which is to book rooms.\nI don't get cell service in here except for maybe in 5 minute pockets.\nFor the room:\nThe room is small, there isn't a coffee maker, the bathroom door doesn't close all the way, the channel selection sucks, and our view is of the sketch parking structure. We didn't pay for anything and I feel jipped.\n\nGo anywhere else. There are a million places to go on the strip
