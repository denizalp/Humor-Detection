Marks Luggage, you are my most favorite always. My second vehicle is my luggage.\nSince I travel for work almost every week, my bags get a lot of wear and tear.\nI buy Travel pro and Samsonite but, they are all made pretty cheaply now just like everything else. So they too break very easily.\nThough they are not cheap in price. The good thing is they come with a guarantee.\nNot everything is covered but, a lot of it is. \nLet us take Travel Pro, they are now made in Viet Nam. All the interior parts are made of Plastic, so when the handle breaks inside it really breaks.\nYou can not get it to go up or down. Since it is made of plastic, the only way to fix it is to get a new piece.\nYeah, Marks Luggage, they order the piece for you, take care of it all through the warranty and you the consumer pay no cost. What could be better.\nThe wheels are a differnt story, if they break there is a cost, but not too bad.\nThey get it done very quickly and I have always been happy with them.\n\nI have been going there for years!  They used to be in downtown Phoenix, near the vet hospital, but now they are up on south 16th street.
