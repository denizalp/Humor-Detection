I ate here on New Years Day.  It seems to be a family-run joint because, well, the whole family was there.  Half were working, the other half were eating and just having a good time.\n\nNormally, this would be quite annoying and a no-no in my book.  When I eat at a restaurant, I don't want little kid(s) running around all over the place.  However, since it was New Years Day, I completely understand why they were there and it didn't bother me one bit.  At times, it was actually quite amusing.  The waitress' son is the funniest, goofiest, little kid, who reminds me of, well, myself now.  Yikes I need to grow up!\n\nWith that said, the food was great, and the waitress was friendly.  It's unfortunate that the place is in the middle of nowhere, but in my opinion the drive is well worth the quality of their breakfast.
