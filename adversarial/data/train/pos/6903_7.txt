Tldr: Unique gourmet gelato flavours at a decent price. \n\nThis place is quite nooooice. At a reasonable price, they offer a wide variety of unique gelato flavours that you wouldn't normally find. \n\nMy favourite so far is the jasmine green tea. I'm a sucker for tea-based frozen desserts, so this one caught my eye right away when i was looking at the menu. The jasmine green tea had a strong bold tea flavour to it, while perfectly blending into the creamy\/sweet base that a gelato offers. I got one scoop in a cup. and it was the right amount for me. Scoops were pretty big \n\nThe staff was not rude, but didn't seem welcoming either. The two ladies (one at cash and one scooping the gelato) had RBF, but whatevs. I'm really just here for the gelato anyways. Will definitely come back to try the roasted oolong and HK milk tea! Would recommend to anyone!
