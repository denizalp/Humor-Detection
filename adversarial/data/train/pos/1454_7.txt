Came here for a Biag of donuts, ended up with an entire Box. The tragedy is that most people in Cleveland have never been here, whereas I detour hours out of my way, and even sleep in my car with an alarm set for 4am, so I can wake up right when they're open and the Crulers are piping hot and gooey, and get a ton of them, and in 1 minute and 41 seconds, ruin all the efforts put in during my workouts for the last 4 weeks. How does Cleveland not know about these? OK, some do, but there should be 500 reviews. Is it because they are out of the way? Well my b***hole is out of the way but it doesn't stop people messing with it during foreplay, amirite?\n\nWhat to get: Crulers\nJust Crulers: Yes. I was going to keep them a secret, but that would be Cruler than anything.\n\nBut you have to try them when they're hot. Which means you have to come at 4am. Are you willing to do that for a donut? Once you try it hot you will thank me. It's not the same microwaved. It's just nottttttt. You may even agree once you try it fresh from its mother donut's womb. Come here and rob the cradle. Do the donut equivalent of Spanish Suckling Pig. You damn well motherf***ing know you want to you donut-obsessed donut sl**. Oh you like that donut do you? Oh you like it a bit too much don't you. Mmmhmm.\n\nA-hem. Where was I.\n\nA movie was filmed here. \"Cruler Intentions.\" If you're wondering where to put your Cruler, if it tastes this good... you can put it anywhere.\n\nSo these Crulers. Easily the best I've ever had. Always come around 4am for them (or whenever they are fresh out of the oven, sometimes a little earlier or later than that), because when these babies are hot and gooey, they will be one of the best things you ever tasted.\n\nI come here a lot in the summers when I visit Cleveland. It's a Cruler summer, leaving me here eating donuts.\n\nLocated far in the distant East Burbs of Cleveland, who knew you'd find one of the best things in food history. Their coffee is good too, and some of their other donuts are not bad. But oh, those heavenly Crulers, hot and gooey, the greatest in the world. They taste like clouds. Bonus points for good service and not minding me sleeping in their parking lot.\n\nAnd Demi Lovato loves these too (although you wouldn't know it to look at her lately). That's why she did a song about them: \"Cruler For The Summer.\"\n\nIf you didn't already get the hint... get to Biagios AT 4AM and not any other time, and try them when they're hot.\n\nDonut go anywhere near NE Ohio without trying the Crulers when hot. Inspired the Jamaican Donut-laden Bobsled movie: Cruler Runnings.
