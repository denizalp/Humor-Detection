This Haunted House was so scary! The zombies and actors throughout the house were very realistic looking with crazy costumes and make up. They seemed to pop out of just about every corner. I liked how some rooms were tilted and were hard to walk on. Some rooms even had different aromas to make you feel like you were in an insane asylum or zombieland. It was pretty unique. Whenever I went into a new room, someone popped up screaming at me which made me scream even louder! The whole thing lasted about 30 minutes, which I think is pretty long. The rooms were so realistic looking that I was worried I was going to have nightmares! I'm so ready for Halloween, now!
