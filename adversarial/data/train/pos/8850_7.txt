How about 5 litres of kalamata olives? \n\nWelcome to aubut\n\n   If you enjoy buying in mass quantities or are that ever hungry deal hunter, you will have a great time here.\n\n   They also have cool, restaurantish things that are great for home use, like 1 litre containers.\n\n   Last but not least, they sporadically receive quality dishes (right, Nora Gray?) that are reasonably priced.\n\nEnjoy\n\nWaka Waka
