So my experience never happened as the team at Sourdough Pizza apparently did not need our business. The restaurant was dead as as my party of 18 sat down the manager quickly came to our table and said we cannot accommodate us. She very rudely told us we had to sit in separate seating orders by family so their servers could understand it. Never had this happen before. If she could not handle our party she should of politely apologized and we could have moved seats, but apparently they did not need the business. We went to Red Robin where they sat us and had no issue. Very disappointing.
