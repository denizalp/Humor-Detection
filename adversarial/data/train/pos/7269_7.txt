Want to try some quality beef soup noodles?  A few simple choices an you're there: \n\n1.  Beef, beef tendon, or a combination of both.\n2.  Thin or thick (hand cut ribbons) noodles.\n3.  Mild or spicy soup.\n\nThe hardest thing is finding the place.  \n\nDeconstructed:  Very well seasoned, deep beefy soup base with the wafting aroma of star anise, hint of ginger, and dried citrus peels.  Great noodles with just the right amount of chew.  Clean, tender, gelatinous tendons (sounds disgusting but \"a rose by any other name...\").  The only catch, the beef is sometimes over braised.  Tender, but dry.  Very common, I'd guess it's authentic by default.\n\nBeef stew soup $8. Beef tendon soup $9.  Combo at $8.50\n\nA simple meal doled out in a non descript restaurant with \"classic\" service (you got your food right?)  It is what it is and that's not bad at all.
