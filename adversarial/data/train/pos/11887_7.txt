I was wonder why this restaurant always looked slow and no cars at front even they located in china town\nSo we decided to go and see what's happening in here.\n Overall,it was pretty okay. Looked clean at sushi bars,and calm environments but nothing special. \nAll the fishes are looked fresh especially Tuna.\nThey have so many types of skewers. Sapporo+skewers are awesomeeee\nBut one thing.. \nCan you guys change the music ? \nThey keep play old britney spears songs..\nOkay oops,I did it again
