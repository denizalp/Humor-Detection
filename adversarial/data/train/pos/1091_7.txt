Took my pup there for a week and he ended up with a full body staff infection & giardia. The second time he boarded here he ended up with an eye infection . Naturally, I don't expect them to take ownership of these situations because it's easy to say it must've been due to external factors that were out of their control. However, I can assure you before and after boarding here my pup has been in perfect health...\n\nI paid over 30,000$ for my pure bred German shepherd purchased directly from Germany and was told by management that my expectations of their services were \"too high\" ( as stated by a manager via a telephone call )  . I'm not sure how my expectations are too high when talking about the life and well being of a living breathing animal specifically a puppy . \n\nAll I'm saying is from one Dog owner to another , whether your four legged loved one was adopted from the shelter or purchased the way they're treated should be top notch . Don't trust them to care for your dog because they really don't .\n\nSince I can't comment to the owner ; I decided to update my review. The pup is our family dog and was taken to this facility under my sibling's name who lives in Henderson, NV. My commentary was written after calling and speaking to a manager on behalf of my siblings after we were brushed off numerous times because she was so upset she was unable to make the call herself.
