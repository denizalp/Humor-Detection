It's a clear bag policy FYI LADIES!! Don't even try to bring any kind of bag in. Same security protocol as professional games now, no bags. They will make you take it back to your car. \n\nThis arena like all others is oval in shape and the many times I have been there are always several entrances open and you can walk into any regardless of where your seat or section is. \n\nI attended the ASU Men's basketball game against Pacific in late December. We were in one the highest sections you could be and could still see very clearly the players and the game. Taking a look around there's really not a bad seat in the house. Being the highest up and not having to squint or ask my guy friends what happened or who is a good thing. Famous lemonade guy comes around with his 'lemonade just like mama made'.
