Thought the tour was 5 star worthy, but a snafu in the route and being stranded downtown made me take away 2 stars.\n\nWe boarded at Excalibur and started our strip tour.  Our guide was very informative, offering information and answering questions along the way.\n\nAfter ended at Circus Circus, we hopped on the downtown route and had an amazing tour guide!  He was funny and smart!\n\nThey drove the routes and pointed out stops along the way. \nWe wanted to get off downtown so we got off the bus at the Golden Nugget.\n\nAfter walking around 2 hours on freemont street, we timed it to get the last bus pickup back to the strip.\n\nIt was 6:25pm and pickup at Freemont St East was scheduled for 6:40.  We got there at 6:28 to be early as to not miss the bus.  Since we didnt stop there on the first leg, we werent exacty sure what corner to stand on, but we figured we would find the bus.\n\n10 minute later - nothing\n15 minutes later - no bus\n20 minutes later, I call the phone number and ask where the downtown bus is.\nThey tell its already heading back to town.\n\nI told them we were at the stop a good 15 minutes early and it never passed!  \nThe dispatcher radioed to the driver and he expalined they skipped that stop because of a road closure.  WHAT?!? A road closure? and Me as a tourist am supposed to know this? The driver or tour guide NEVER said these pick-up locations would never be picked up from.  I cant belive that.\n\nSo here we are  - stranded downtown, miles away from our hotel and forced to pay a taxi to get us back.  what a joke.\n\nThey offered to turn the bus around and go pick us up at one of the downtown hotels...well I wasnt going to make a full busload of a people be inconvienced and put off their schedule.\n\nI could not belive they didnt offer me a seat or ride on the evening bus tour. \nInstead I had to shell out more cash to make my way back to the strip.
