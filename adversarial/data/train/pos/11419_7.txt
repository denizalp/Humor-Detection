I had not been to Rollin Smoke in a long time and was in the area (sort of) and felt like a little BBQ for lunch.  Dang I missed this place!  It's not far from the strip in distance, yet feels a million miles away.  This hole in the wall restaurant feels like it was transported from some small town down south, not the glitz of Las Vegas (in a good way).  Your olfactory sensors are hit with the heavenly smell of smoked meat even before you cross the threshold (prepare to leave with a new smoke cologne too).  \n\nYou counter order and pick up your utensils before heading to a table.  You can sit at the picnic tables by the counter, or cross over into the dining room that houses additional tables and a couple TVs.  Tables are equipped with a roll of paper towels and their signature BBQ sauce, which is a little sweeter than traditional Texas sauce, but good.\n\nThis trip we got combo plates of Sliced Brisket with Fried Okra and Pulled Pork with Kicken Beans and Jalapeno Coleslaw.  The brisket and pork were perfect.  Both tender and smokey.  The pork had some awesome burnt end pieces that were fantastic.  The fried okra was good.  The Kicken Beans had some heat and pieces of the smoked meats in the sauce.  Definitely a side I would order again!  I did not care for the Jalapeno Coleslaw too much.  It had a bunch of black pepper that overwhelmed the flavor of the dish.\n\nI need to remember to keep this place in the rotation a little more often!
