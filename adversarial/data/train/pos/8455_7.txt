When I Googled our nearest Toyota dealership, I saw a lot of negative reviews, but since it is so close to our new house, I decided to go for it. After all, I did not have any major problems - just wanted to fix a broken visor, shave the floor under the gas pedal (mandatory recall), and replace oil.\n\nMy advisor was Rob Riley and I had a very smooth transaction from the beginning to the end. Everything except oil & filter change ($38.20) was covered under the warranty, I got Camry as a loaner and my car was ready by the end of the day. \nThey also replaced a battery since it failed the test and had a corrosion buildup.\n\nThe dealership is spacious and well kept. They have a barber shop + nail & spa store right next to the service department, so if you have to wait for your car longer than expected, at least you can get your nails done or have a haircut .\n\nI cannot comment on sales department or any other advisers, but Rob Riley was very professional, and if I have any problems with my car in the future, I will schedule my appointment with him.
