I really hate to do this, but I have no other choice. Since when does a burger place have a rope queue? And why are the female workers wearing less clothes than the street walkers out on the corner of The Strip? \n\nStrike 1: Took forever to be greeted by a server. \n\nStrike 2: An additional 15 minutes for waters. Tack on another 10 minutes for beer. \n\nStrike 3: Ordered a burger medium well, it came out medium. Friend ordered their burger medium, it came out medium well. Sigh. \n\nThe entire place reeks of truffle oil. Like, to the point of nauseatingly overwhelming. We should have went back to Gordon Ramsay Pub, had a much better experience there!
