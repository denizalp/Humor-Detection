3.5 stars.  I like the different selections, etc.  The sandwich choices were way different than what you would find at other places.  I had the Dilly Bird.  It was cracked wheat bread loaded with alfalfa sprouts, turkey and cream cheese.  Yum!\nDownfall was that it was a delivery and took almost an hour to make 6 sandwiches and deliver them less than a mile.\nPlus, I burped up the sprouts all day long.\nI didn't mind, but Jenni at work certainly did!
