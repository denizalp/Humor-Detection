(Lyrics - MAGIC! - Rude)\n\nSaturday evening jumped out to Yelp\nAnd put on my best suit\nGot in my car and raced like a jet\nAll the way to you\n\nCame to your door with food in my mind\nTo order from your menu\nCause I know that you're in Restaurant Week, yeah\n\nCan I have your Risotto for the rest of my life?\nSay yes, say yes 'cause I need to know\nYou say I'll always get my blessing til the day I write\nGood luck, my friend, but answer is Bo Bites\n\nWhy you gotta go to Crud...o's\nDon't you know I'm hungry too?\nWhy you gotta go to Crud...o's\nI'm gonna Bo Bites anyway!\n\n\nCrudo's has had quite a reputation in the valley and needless to say I had to make my visit on Restaurant Week!  \n\nThe place itself is oddly located, but that didn't bother me much.  I came on a rainy Saturday night with my partner in crime.  She's the one and only @ssuze photo extraordinaire on Instagram!  She shoots the pictures and I write!\n\nWe both ordered the 4 course meal.  We started with the Albacore with Truffle Watermelon rind and black pepper and the Yellowtail, Controne, Bottanga, Chive.  Needless to say, I don't know what the heck it means, but boy was it a perfect start.  Eating sashimi with a kick of sweet and aromatic seasoning.  Next was the cheese dishes; Burrata-Pancetta Vin, Arugula and the Ricotta Walnut sauce, and Honey.  I would say this is my least favorite course since I'm not much of a cheese guy.  However, both dishes worked!  Sweet honey and creamy ricotta cheese mix over bread; who knew would taste great.  The Arugula gave the Burrata cheese a nice subtle taste.  Next was the entree round, we went for their famous Squid ink risotto and their pork belly smoked tomato Agrodolce Polenta.  I see why their it's known in town as the Famous Squid ink Risotto; definitely one of my favorites of the night and recommended.  Cooked to perfection the mixture of tuna, chilis, and tomatoes made this dish a spicy and sweet delight!  The pork belly was again cooked well, but didn't really do much for me.  We ended of course with dessert; Butterscotch Pot de Creme with Olive oil, Lemon, and Rosemary Shortbread and Chef Cullen's Bread Pudding.  The shortbread worked only with the cookie atop.  Without it just didn't give much texture and I mainly tasted only the Butterscotch.  The Bread Pudding well, it was bread pudding in the end.  Not much for dessert in my book.\n\nOverall, the service spot on and top notch.  The place itself is classic and reminded me of some old southern style home.  Great ambiance and date place!  In the end, Crudo deserves my love and definitely a hot spot for me! - Enjoy!
