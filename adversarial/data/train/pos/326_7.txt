Sunday dinner buffet..$12.99 per person.  As you enter, the hostess is very busy on her cell phone texting.  It was almost like we disturbed her coming in. \n It was a very nice looking, clean buffet...but.....  Nowhere near the 150 items they say they have.\n\nThe food looked good, but it was not labeled , so you didn't know what you were having...And it didn't matter because it all tasted the same. \n\n We were there at 5 PM and maybe 15-18 others were there.\n\nThe spare ribs and the crab legs and the short ribs were empty when we came in and remained empty until we were almost ready to leave.  The seafood soup had no seafood in it and it was not hot, it was room temperature.  Same with the shark fin soup, no fin in it.  The fruit at the small dessert bar didn't look too fresh either. Most of the trays were 1\/2 full at best and not refilled.\n\nActually, the only items I liked were the mussels and the clams.\n\nIn the hour we were there we were not asked if we needed our drinks refilled, but they did clean the table off in a timely manner.\n\nFrom our table, I watched the employees eating in the kitchen as well.\n\nSorry Lees..but we will not be coming back.  There are way too many buffets in Vegas to waste money here.
