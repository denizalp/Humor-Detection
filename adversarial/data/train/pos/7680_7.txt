I used to love Xtreme Bean as a teenager.  Now, nearly a decade later, I am unimpressed.  The coffee is okay at best, the prices are what you would expect from a coffee house, and they offer free WiFi - that's about all the good I can list.\n\nThe serious downside is the staff and the ambiance.  On my last visit to the Bean, I went with a friend who is a regular.  The girl at the cash register recognized him and chatted with him while completely ignoring me.  After 10 minutes of chatting laden with profanity, complaining about her employer, the sun, and screaming \"F***\" while continually asking her coworker at the drive-thru to give her sunglasses- she finally asked him what he wanted to drink.\n\nShe then ignored me again.  After literally taking out money and waiving it to her I ordered my drink and a bagel.  All I asked for was coffee with hazelnut added and a bagel with cream cheese.\n\nShe got my order wrong.  There was no hazelnut in my coffee, the coffee tasted burnt and old, and there was about a half pound of cream cheese on my questionably toasted (cold but crunchy) bagel.\n\nI MIGHT have even been able to overlook many of the downfalls in service and quality (frankly I'll drink just about anything you call coffee and pour in a cup for me) if the atmosphere had at least been pleasant.  The staff is in charge of music and apparently often uses their personal play list as the music for the shop.  This would be fine if it wasn't being played at a concert level volume.  I like Thrice and other loud bands, but not when I'm trying to enjoy a cup of coffee and conversation.  \n\nI'd rather go to Starbuck's across the street.
