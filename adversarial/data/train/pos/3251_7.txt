I'm extremely picky about my haircuts. These guys are really friendly and you have your neighborhood barbershop feel. \n\nBut, they're talented to a certain extent. They do great fades and line ups, but I was looking for a comb over and they didn't even attempt to use scissors. The top was barely touched, leaving an uneven hairdo. \n\n3 stars because they do good work, but it isn't personally my style. I probably won't be back. \n\nBring cash.
