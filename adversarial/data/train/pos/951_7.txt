Meatballs. \n\nI wanted meatballs. \n\nJust out of the blue, I was just sitting there, minding my own business, and all a sudden I had to eat meatballs. No, not those Chef Boy-Ar-Dee meatballs that are planets with pasta spaceships, or the ones some kid with half-glazed eyes slops into your foot-long Subway sandwich, but Israeli meatballs with red sauce, like the ones one of my best friend's mom's would cook for Shabbat and I would eat 12 in one sitting.\n\nAnd since Haifa on 12th & Northern closed down before I could ever set foot in there, Sabuddy it had to be. \n\nSabuddy. \n\nI like saying that name in quick succession. \n\nSabuddy Sabuddy Sabuddy.\n\nAnyway. \n\nI take in the scene as I walk in. The owner sitting in a corner, reading the paper. Big mural (photo?) of the desert against a wall. Some pop ballad in Hebrew wafting overhead. Very made up Scottsdale grandmas with dyed hair and bright headbands interspersed amongst the tables. I sit down and the waitress takes my order.\n\nSmall Russian potato salad. Jerusalem meatballs. \n\nBecause I had to eat meatballs. \n\nBesides, there are a billion places in the Valley I can already go to to eat hummus, shawarma, and falafel. I wanted to get from Sabuddy what the other Middle Eastern places didn't have.\n\nThe potato salad is then placed before me. \n\nAnd also, one pita. \n\nOk. \n\nSo...how do I eat a pita with potato salad? Do I stuff my potato salad into the pita? Do I break off a piece of pita and dip it into the potato salad?  I'm confused. But I eat the pita anyway.\n\nThe potato salad is good, but not amazing. But then again, I don't know what I was really expecting out of 'Russian' potato salad anyway. Mini-peroshkies hiding amongst the potatoes? Beets? Vodka? Who knows.\n\nBut then, the meatballs. They arrive, placed majestically on a bed of rice, with salad, garbanzos with tahini, and some sauteed veggies. I behold the sight for a split second, and then I take a bite out of a meatball. \n\nMan. Just like Mom used to make. Not my Mom, but you get the drift.\n\nI sit and eat in silence.\n\nMore like devour in silence.\n\nMore like inhale in silence.\n\nTwo fancy grannies sitting adjacent to me get served their veggie platters, with falafel, hummus, babaganoush.  Their dishes look really great, as artfully done as their faces, but I don't really care.\n\nBecause for me, it's all about the meatballs. \n\nAnd then they're gone. \n\nThere were only 3.\n\nI sigh deeply.\n\nBecause it's all over.\n\nTime to go back to whatever I was doing before I decided I wanted meatballs. \n\nThe end.
