When I first moved to Lakewood, I was in desperate need of a haircut.  I didn't know where to go, and as I'm particuluarly particular about my hair, I had no idea where to turn.  I was also low on funds.  A friend of mind recommended Carabel's.  I figured, what the hell, it's only hair and it'll grow back and it's not a big deal.\n\nI pulled in the parking lot, and was shocked to see a pink building.  We're not talking pastel pink, we're talking BRIGHT pink.  I walk in the door, and it literally looks like a junk shop.  There is all kinds of stuff laying everywhere.  I had an appointment with Rose, and I was pleasantly surprised to see a younger woman cutting hair.  I believe the average age of a customer at Carabel's is around 63.  They have the old drying chairs, women in curlers, etc.  \n\nHowever, Rose did an excellent job with my hair. She took her time and made sure I was happy.  All in all, the haircut cost me about 12 dollars, including tip.  They do just about everything, from waxing, color, perms, etc.\n\nIf you need a decent haircut, at a decent price, see Rose at Carabel's.
