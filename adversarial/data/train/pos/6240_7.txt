Shopped around for a sectional for my condo and ended up driving pass this place. Went inside and found a sectional I liked thanks to the help of a very nice sales man named Mike... \"Like Michael Jackson\" he says.  The following day after purchasing the sectional I received a price quote from another company quoting a different price. 600 dollars less then what Mike charged me for the sectional. So I called Mike to explain to him that the sectional he sold me was over priced. He proceed to ask me what would I like to do? I told him that's the reason I was calling him. He continued to tell me I would have to pay a 25% 369.00 restocking fee (on a floor model that won't be delivered for a week) and that It would cost me more to get out of it. So I called their other location on flamingo and peco's  to ask what price they had the sectional priced at. The sales rep on the phone put me on hold for a while then referred me to their manager Tony.  When I asked the sales rep why he's referring me to a manager when I asked for a price quote. Then he said that I would need to come to the store because the sectional not in stock. I informed him that I saw it the day prior. He put me on hold again then told me \"whatever price u have we will price match it\" I informed him that I already purchased the couch n would like to know the price they have on their floor model and he put me on hold again came back and quoted me a price cheaper then what Mike initially sold it to me for.  So I drove down to the location and sure enough the sectional is priced much less then the other location.  Smh this buisness is shady and so are their sales tatics. Nobody shops for large purchases to be taken advantage of so that the sales representatives can make commission.  Before you shop here I would price quote other locations. I'm sure u can find better deals and not be shamed out of your money.
