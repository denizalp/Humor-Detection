DO NOT RENT FROM HERE- \n-seriously save yourself and don't even look on here, some of the amenities are good. That is the only reason why i moved here but then after everything I've been through don't fall for anything they try to buy you into staying here. \n\nI've lived here for 2 years and it's been the worst living experience and it could of been better if management did their jobs. MAINTENANCE GUYS ARE AWESOME, and super cool. Every time i had a problem the office basically said it was on my own. I've been taking pictures to prove how awful this place is.  Garbage is always on the ground all over the place. I live on the first floor. When they bring out a 3rd company to do maintenance and start using their blower machine to move things off the ground all that dirt and dust went through my window and got all my stuff dirty. I've tried to call right when they open at 9am and they must not turn their phones on until later which was a big inconvinced  to me, since i'm the resident and was calling on my time when they were suppose to be open. Also living here, I've heard so many stories of people breaking into cars\/windows\/ and even getting mugged by people on property. This place is not safe and all they care about is money.  Literally every time I see the office people they wont say hi and aren't friendly. I'm living here and they can't be friendly and helpful?
