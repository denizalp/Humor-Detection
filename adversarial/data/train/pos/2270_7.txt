If you are a Nostalgia buff, or one that just joys the atmosphere of a time going by then a trip through Punchy's Diner is up your alley. I have been riding by this place for quite some time in my trips up and down Route 29 in Concord, observing this unique-looking Diner with what look like two automobile is in the front window. Upon a family members visit to town, and seeking something different than some of the regular restaurants or chain locations, I suggested punchy's Diner as I knew he was a fan of diners also. Upon entering is the immediate throwback to the Happy Days television show style era. Fun seating and looking at the menu I decided on a couple of Pancakes and some fried liver mush.. my Pop decided on the breakfast special, consisting of an omelet, bacon, hash browns and some coffee.\nMy two pancakes arrived and they were the size of the plate literally, yet light and fluffy. The liver mush, while I don't have this often, was superb, lightly crunchy, a delight to the occasional pork lovers palette... I struggled to finish the plate sized pancakes, but maned-up and finished them as they were too delicious to leave but not enough for a to go box.\n\nA stroll through the far end of the diner revealed 2 vintage autos on display with in a glass case. While I tried to get management to allow me to gain access for a closer look I understood their policy about not allowing people to touch the vehicles as they appear to be in mint condition..\nA fabulous stroll down a Time Gone by, service was spectacular and the food truly worthy of a return visit, but this time I need to be a little bit more hungry before tackling those pancakes.
