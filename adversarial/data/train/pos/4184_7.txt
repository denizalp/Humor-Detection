Central Blends' muffins may seem relatively harmless, but beware. First you'll sample the regulars -- blueberry bran, cranberry oat -- then you'll realize that they are just the gateway drug to a daily roulette of muffin goodness: raspberry lemon ginger, coconut mango, or the amazing rhubarb streusel... Believe me, I could go on.\n\nThere's much more than muffins, of course, and once you're addicted to those, you might just want to come back for lunch. They also have a constant rotation of delicious soups and sandwiches, always with some vegetarian options and often gluten-free as well. \n\nAs for ambience? I think the wobbly tables are a potential downside (if only because you might spill one of their excellent coffees), but the exhibition of local artists usually makes up for it. And there are handmade, one-of-a-kind greeting cards above the cream and sugar, $5 each, which are exactly what I would want for my birthday (hint!) As the other reviewer noted, it's the kind of place where, if you start going regularly, you'll find yourself running into lots of people you know and maybe even starting conversations with people you don't know. After all, muffin addicts need support groups...
