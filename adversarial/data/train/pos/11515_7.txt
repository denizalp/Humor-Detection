My friends wanted to come here. I saw the reviews and warned them but they still wanted to go. We had reservations for a party of 10. When we got there, we told the hostess about our reservation and she looked at us like she had no idea what we were talking about. In all honesty, I think there was a language barrier. We were all standing there for about 10 mins with no one telling us a status. \n\nWe finally get sat. I knew right away the experience wasn't gonna be good. There were 10 of us and they gave us 2 menus to share for the whole table. I have no idea why. They weren't even busy. They sat us at a table that could fit 8 at the most. Everyone ordered drinks from the bar and I got a non alcoholic drink. He doesn't bring it to me. We finally get to order. I ordered a fajita salad with shrimp. Comes with pico, fajita veggies and a good assortment of stuff. When I got my food there was fruit all in my salad as well as other items that wasn't described. There was no fajita veggies the the whole mix wasn't right. I questioned the server and he just about all the fruit and he made a comment about \"Oh, you don't like fruit\" and giggled and walked away. I pulled up the menu online and saw I received a mixed salad instead of the fajita salad. I told the server about it and instead of offering me something else or to remake it, he just takes my plate and walks away. Several people ordered different tacos and he couldn't tell which was what. So he pretty much just laid them on the table to have people figure it out. \n\nThe whole experience was awful. I will never come to this place again. Sad, because there really aren't any other options around. Ugh.
