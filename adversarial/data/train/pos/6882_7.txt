(This review is for take-out service)\n\nMost people have a 'go-to' list of their favorite comfort food places, and emergency list that is used when you need tasty, predictable, and reliable. \n\nRed Devil Pizza is at the top of my list for great NY style pizza. Forgetting fancy pizza, this place offers really tasty pizza, at a good price for what you get. Red Devil uses quality ingredients, and doesn't 'church it up' (with apologies to Joe Dirt).\n\nIf you are ready for an extra treat, ask for your pie to be 'well done', that gets you a bit of char on the crust, and takes it from good to great. The guys behind the takeout window work hard to make some of the best pie in the 602, so enjoy!
