TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE!!! \n\nWe had called THREE times before going and kept getting the voicemail. I wasn't even sure if they were open & initially we wanted to place a to-go order. We said forget it and took a chance by deciding to just walk over. There are so many other options on the strip we knew if they were closed we could find another spot. \n\nAS SOON AS WE WALKED IN WE JUST STOOD THERE... almost 5 minutes ... the servers just looked at us. A flimsy girl finally approached us & cleaned off a two top table. \nAs soon as we sat down at 1:20 the waiter (some guy that did not want to wait on us... I know because he goes \"so & so\" will be right over & ends up taking our order and being our server anyway) tells us \"we close at 2 PM, so you need to know what you want.\" I was so thrown off but I held my tongue and sat quietly. I already knew what I wanted because I had looked over the menu on YELP. We place our order (glad we knew what we wanted or we would have been shit out of luck).... he takes our order and my husband ordered an orange juice and me a water.... our waiter puts our order in and begins to clean.... he cleans for a good ten minutes & still no drinks. Other customers are looking around. I'm so upset at this point I call over the flimsy girl & say \"could we get water please...\" her response \"well, what did you order?\" At this point I'm in flames and just proceed to walk out. I was a server and worked in the industry for years. I get it your ready to close but this was our first time visiting. We just moved to the area and could have been regulars! You just lost 30 percent tippers & great conversation. Keep up the hard work you two. \n\nBy the way after ordering my husband had sprinted like a mad man down the street to take out cash because apparently they are cash only.\n\nAfter reading the rest of the reviews, it seems they have good days & bad days. Hope you catch them on a good day.
