I recently went to Divine Skin Spa for the first time, I took my mom with me for her birthday. We got massages and I can't express how happy we were with the services. We purchased an offer off Groupon for two $70 services for a good price, the parking was easy, Divine was prompt with our appointment, we had Sara & Amber and I definitely would recommend both of them. At first I was unsure about purchasing an offer on Groupon but after going to get our massages on Saturday, we are HAPPY and definitely will be going back for other services. Thank you Divine Skin Spa for making my mom's birthday amazing!
