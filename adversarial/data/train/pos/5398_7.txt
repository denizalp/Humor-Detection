Update to Marks reply. Your artist was rude from second one. Read my review again. He has 45 mins before his next client. He did not even want to talk to us, show us his book. He seemed bothered when I did not want a dove to be Black! Yes I understand white ink. We did not book for Sunday, as I would never let someone who can't take the time, when he has the time to talk to us. He actually blew me off to book a walk in, without even an excuse me while I talk to this lady. I went down the street to a shop that took time, from the front desk to my artist. Who did an amazing job on Sunday. Obviously your artist did not hear a word I said, as I told him several times it's a mass, not cancer. My review is honest, more than I can say for your staff.\nNext edit Keep trying Mark he never showed me his book, or did I compliment him on his work. Its not a purple ribbon. I did not want a white tattoo, I wanted doves flying away from a GRAY RIBBION! This shows how little your employee listened, and proves his rudeness! Stop defending yourself, your digging a huge hole, and look ridiculous! I wasn't alone and I'll have her leave a review also. As she got a tattoo with me on Sunday, at a shop down the road, with your ex artists. They left for a reason, and I can see why. And no it was not his client that walked in, she was also a walk in who booked an appointment. She used her card for it, check your records.
