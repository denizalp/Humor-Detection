I have zero complaints about Rollier Hardware, and I'm as handy as Zsa Zsa Gabor!\n\nRollier is like a smaller version of Lowe's crossed with Michael's Arts and Crafts and Frank's Shoes over in Caste Village.\n\nAnd when I say that it is smaller, I don't mean that it's small. In fact, it's deceptively spacious, with things to gawk at 'round every corner. There's even a big parking lot out back. \n\nThey sell, paint, lighting fixtures, sinks, drill bits, electrical cords, Badger lip balm, X-Mas decorations, Carhartt apparel, ladders, picture frames, hammers, nails, screws, saws, *gasp*. That's just a fraction of what they pack in here too. I can't even remember everything I saw, and I cased the joint. \n\nThis is the Saks 5th Avenue for the git 'er 'done, hurr hurr, set. \n\nAll I walked out of here with was a pair of leather work gloves for about 8 bucks, so they aren't all that bad pricewise either.\n\nNow, yeah, I could have gotten the gloves at Home Depot, but don't they get enough money? \n\nThe good old fashioned neighborhood hardware\/variety store still has a lick of a chance after all, and this is one primo example. Don't be deterred by the swanky zip code. You'll likely find just what you need here in this classy, immaculately kept store for that household job you've been putting off since last Spring.
