I really love this spa. I've visited it three times on two visits to LV. This review only pertains to the men's wet area, not any services. \n\nThe spa is gorgeous and the array of wet rooms is impressive. First, the hot water spa is really, really nice. The bench bubbles, side jets, and floor bubbles make it oh-so-relaxing. The steam room is at just the right temperature and the lighting is soothing. The sauna's wood is clean, fresh-smelling, and the temp is pretty good here, too. The chilled mist room is wonderful. It is a great way to cool down quickly. Plus, the lounge areas are really nice and provide a variety of totally quiet, one with a TV (on mute, with captions), and one by the hot tub. Towels are fluffy and plentiful. Water is constantly restocked. And there are some light, healthy snacks. Very nice!\n\nMy only suggestion would be that they should enforce a no swimsuit policy here, much like Korean spas do. It seems creepy and unsanitary to have a guy sweating it out in the steam room in his cotton shorts and then take those sweat-laden shorts directly into the hot tub. Guys, be comfortable being in your birthday suit around other guys who have the same equipment ... or don't spa. That's my take on it.
