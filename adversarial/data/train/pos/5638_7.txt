I went once, had a bad experience, and went a second time because I was nearby and starving...also bad experience.  \n\nFor example:\n\n*Server dropped a serving spoon into a dish of polenta.  Put his fingers into the sauce to retrieve the spoon, and then served it to us, and licked his fingers clean.  I've never seen that before, and I hope that until the end of my days I never see it again.  \n*Ate with a vegetarian friend and ordered only meatless dishes.  Half of those were served with a meat sauce on them (no mention on the menu), so friend couldn't eat anything.\n* Food was rather tasteless and bland.\n* Multiple servers handle each table, so no one seems to know what anyone else is doing.  3 times servers asked us \"did Mandy get such-and-such for you?\"  Each time I asked, \"who is...?\"\n\nOverall, it's bad food, incompetent service, and a general air of indifference.  Since it's on Yonge St maybe they target tourists who won't be back whether the food and service are good or bad, and hence the attitude of indifference.  I'd get a take-out slice of pizza before eating here again.
