Grill city recently opened inside Seafood city. Lines has been long and it's true, service has been slow. \n\nI came from Washington and there's a grill city there. I was excited when one opened in Vegas. It's inexpensive and delicious. \n\nI really enjoy the pork or chicken BBQ sticks that is packed with flavor. Give it a try! You can get 4 BBQ sticks for $11.00.\n\nFor the grill side, I also enjoy the grill chicken which is packed with flavor as well. You don't need any dipping sauce what so ever. I also enjoy the pork belly, who doesn't love pork belly?! Pack with a vinegar BBQ flavor you can resist.\n\nTowards the entr√©es, I am a palabok fan.. Squeeze lemon package on top & once again pack with flavor.. But defiantly ask for lemon if you were to get palabok cause it can be salty without it. \n\nI must say they do have a lot of pork going on here but if you don't care for the calories, grill city is the place to indulge.
