We went here over the weekend when the lines are very long. There are no lines during the week but I only have weekends due to no vacation at work. The reason for the average stars is because they got cheap, no, not the prices, the offerings. I understand they can't do all real flowers all the time in that quantity, so they got the fakies. It's still lovely don't get me wrong, but I miss the scent of fresh flowers in the air. If we must live with it we will survive. But skimping on the buffet!??! What is that all about!??! They use to offer crab legs at lunch, now they only offer them for dinner. For $26 before tax I want my crab! Dinner is $40 except for Fri and Sat nights when it was $44 and marked as \"gourmet\" versus just dinner. There are other spendier items removed from the lunch buffet, but I forgot what they were. Apparently dinner use to offer lobster but no more. Sadness! \n\nNow I get there are some opportunists eating 20 crab legs at once. That's wrong and selfish.  What about putting a limit on the amount of crab and lobster any one person can get whilst keeping the rest buffet style? Sure it sounds cheesy but it would be easy to keep track of if people had tickets or something? I guess I'd rather have some than none at all, and I am one of those people who eat very little at a time, believe me, I don't ever get my money's worth, even at Izzy's lol. Anyway, the rest of the food was pretty good. The desserts were so perfectly hand crafted, almost too pretty to eat, most were good. \n\nI think they can add a pretty waterfall or something to make the elegant brightly lit flowery atmosphere even more gorg, like they do at some nice Indian restaurants. Maybe then I won't be as cognizant of my missing crab legs if I am distracted further by the beautiful environment. I heard from my family that Mandalay Bay buffet is better, next time :)
