The parking lot has dedicated spots for ER patients, look for them.\n The cafeteria has done delicious pizza, if you get stuck waiting for a ride.\n Courteous, caring staff.\n They all seemed to care about me and what was up. No one hesitated when I asked for anything, like a warm blanket. Each person took the extra minute to make sure I was good.\n The check in was the fastest I have seen yet. No waiting while hurting, all done in the room, and taken care of for me while I was getting the EKG. :)\n I also loved the food, which is very rare at an ER. The Pizza was hot and fresh, and the workers there asked the person in front of me if she had enough Ranch? Whaaa? LOL\n I used their Phone Registration, and she was very nice, helpful, and sympathetic. You have to preregister three days in advance if you do it online but for emergancies they will do it by phone, then a quick run in to get the bloodwork done. Bing Bam Boom, done.
