Vinnie rocks!\n\nI love his style, raunchy, dirty, hilarious. i have seen his show twice, lucky me i am in the travel industry so i get show comps and yes i am a show whore, seen close to 75 shows in 5 years living here in vegas so far :)\n\nThe first time i was one of the audience members he messed with, i was lucky, was not bad it went well with his \"wow look at the tits on her\" i introduced myself as \"nikki\" he replies nice to meet ya \"mickey\" lol. yes he treated me as the ditzy blonde. at the time i was a bleached blonde, yeah of course he got me as i stuck out like a sore thumb. at the closing of the show he called me on stage and gave me two tickets to see xburlesque. yay for me! \n\nI recently saw him again, was worried the stage act would be a bit predictable since i had already seen it before. not the case, what is awesome is his show is always different nightly since he plays off of the audience so much it can never be the same experience! love that. i enjoyed it even more the second time around!\n\nAt the end of the show when he walks to his merchandise table to autograph stuff he pulls out a cigarette to smoke and i asked him for one and he pulled a cig out of his pack and gave me one! haha too cool. he smokes parliaments btw.\n\nHe is way underrated in that small venue at the flamingo, he is going places and really should have his own act and theatre like what's his name... over at the tropicana. vinnie is way too good for this small venue. \n\nThe chances are very high that you will be part of the show as vinnie hits up i would say at least 60% of the audience. it is a raunchy fun experience.\n\nI am ready to see him for my third time.\n\nlove ya vinnie, you are dope funny!
