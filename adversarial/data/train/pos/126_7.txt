i fell asleep during the show...  and i've never fallen asleep in any cirque shows before.  \n\nwell for one, i'm not a beatles fan, so it was more difficult to get me engaged with the production.  \n\nthe acrobatics did not live up to other cirque shows' standards.\n\njust glad i had a glass of wine in hand to get me through the show.
