\"This place is trying sooo hard to be New York.\"\n\nThat's the closest an annoying acquaintance of mine from NY could come to praising Phoenix when we came here. Backhanded though it may be, I think it was his way of admitting that he couldn't think of a reason to sneer at us locals as we enjoyed our wine and cheese. \n\nWhen I used to work downtown I'd come here for lunch all the time, especially when in the mood for lighter fare. Their rotating soup du jour is always superb, as are their salads. The selections of both wine and cheeses are extensive. It truly is painful to come here on nights when the crowds are sparse. My hope is that the owner, Rep. Ken Cheuvront (D-Phoenix), can ride through the current lulls created by Light Rail construction, which will hopefully end very soon as the downtown portion is completed.
