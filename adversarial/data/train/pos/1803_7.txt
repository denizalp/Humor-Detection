Why so much hate??? They've got to be doing something right for this chain to make it this far. Lee's Sandwiches will one day be an international phenomenon. Now I'm not on the bandwagon yet because of several key concepts, but I consider Lee's Sandwiches the Starbucks\/McDonald of Vietnamese fast food. Not to say I'm against or for fast food chains, I simply respect success. Keep in mind how many people these chains employ and the salary and benefits they provide vs horribly ran, no customer service mom and pop places. \n\nVietnamese food really have the potential to be as mainstream as say American, French, Italian, Mexican and Chinese cuisine. But sadly, what really holds it back is the concept. Most great Vietnamese chefs don't understand that style is as equally important as flavor profile. The rare greats that do understand, like the An family with the Crustacean (http:\/\/www.anfamily.com\/Restaurants\/crustacean_beverlyhills\/displaypages\/homepage.html) chain is simply killing it. \n\nSo ask yourself this. Would any non-Yelpers (Westerners), or even Yelpers that's not adventurous , dare step foot in a place like Dakao, or Pho Hue Thai and order Banh Mi?\n\nI think Lee's Sandwiches is fantastic for what this city needs. It's a slap in the face for all the local shops to kick it up a notch (mainly Decor and customer service). It's a wake up call to say that good food is no excuse for poor overall dining experience. \n\nIn conclusion, this Lee's offers way too many choices for their own good. Less is more. Just look at Chipotle.
