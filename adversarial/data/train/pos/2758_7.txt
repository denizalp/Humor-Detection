(Lyrics - Of Monsters And Men - Mountain Sound)\n\nI heard them brewing in the valley\nSo I called my friends and fam\nFar away from all the commotion \nI had caused with my two hands\n\nThirsty we traveled armed with nothing but a hunger\nWe came, from far away\n\nHold your craft brews now\n(Sleep until the valley of the sun goes down)\nThrough the peaks we ran\n(Deep into the North Mountain Brew)\nHold your craft brews now\n(Sleep until the valley of the sun goes down)\nThrough the peaks we ran\n\n\nNorth Mountain Brewing is off the map in my books.  I wouldn't have guessed it exist simply because I don't travel to that part of Phoenix often. However, I'm glad I had the opportunity to visit this locally own brewery!  North Mountain focuses on what they call Beercentric foods; or foods that are inspired by beers.  \n\nI came on a Sunday afternoon brunch with a gang of a 7 and went for the beer flights right away.  I'm not much of a beer drinker anymore, but I can say the beers I ordered were definitely tasty and each had it's own character; some sweet, some floral, and some strong like whiskey!  Overall, I really enjoyed their beers.  However, I'm a food guy so let's get started!  \n\nI wasn't too hungry the day I attended, but they seemed to have some mouthwatering dishes; Poutine breakfast, Chicken & Waffles, and Skillet Scrambles.  Today I ordered the North Mountain Scramble with over-easy egg.  Overall, the sausage and bacon beneath was cooked to perfection with the oozing of the egg; gave this dish welcoming brunch bite with every sip of beer!  What I also appreciate about the dish I ordered was the size; it wasn't overly huge to the point where I had to take some home.  All the other dishes seemed pretty big, but I guess I picked it right this time around! - Enjoy!
