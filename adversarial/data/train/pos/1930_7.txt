1st impressions are everything right? Well I will never return again. I'd love to tell you about the food, I'd love to tell you about the beer, however, I can't. Saturday 3.22 a group of 6 of us entered wild wings at around 11pm. We were quickly sat by a hostess. That's pretty much the end of our experience. We sat at our table for 20 minutes trying multiple times to flag down a server, manager, leprechaun, or anyone who would get us food and drink. After 20 minutes of no success we left saying how bad that was to the girl at the hostess stand, we were shrugged off. The next day I sent wild wings an email.... It's now Thursday, no response thus I assume you don't care about your customers.
