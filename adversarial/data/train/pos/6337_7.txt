I am going to say 21\/2 stars...\nOk this place was known as La Unica  and I have checked in under that name because, it seems that no one has reviewed this place.\n\n      I swear by the La Unica in Huntersville but, it maybe why they changed the name. Service TERRIBLE. Here is the story your a Mexican Joint Ok Most Mexican joints are known for their chips and Salsa Ok they had 3 different types ( of Salsa) but, I would be making tortilla chips to order I mean come on 2 cuts in The corn shells drop in hot oil and Wham fresh chips a little salt . \n      They may not have been out of a bag but, they certainly were not fresh. Strike ONE. I ordered the ceviche  for a starter ... Starter key word here I had to ask for it 3 times . Not sure where they got the recipe they need to start over Strike TWO . Do not ask me why I ordered fried fish at a Mexican restaurant but, I was surprised it was pretty tasty.\n        The wife had shrimp with Chipotle sauce it was more like Shrimp Alfredo with two Huge pieces of Chipotle in the sauce it did have a pretty good taste even though there was nothing Italian about it. We had Desert to go Flan ( I had to go   traditional) not bad . We also had a slice of the tres leches cake it was pretty tasty as well.... maybe they need to go into the desert business? Would I go back? Ummm not really worth the drive I did see a Sushi place next door?
