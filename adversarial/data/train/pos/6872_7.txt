Expensive....expensive...expensive. What more can I say? There are limited food options - steak, fish and more steak. So if you want an entree that is a chicken or duck breast with a nice sauce or if you are in the mood for ribs or even shrimp with fettucini forget it, you are not getting it here. This is a casual and yet very expensive steakhouse. Good for those who can't cook a steak for themselves or who are on an expense account with no limits.\n\nWere the steaks good, yes. Were the sides tasty, yes. Was the complimentary bread fresh, yes. But the place was packed and it took nearly 15 minutes to get a server to approach us and well the quality and service was just not good enough to overcome the really high prices for what are some of the easiest entrees and sides to make for yourself at home.\n\nSides were $8.99 and up for a moderately small, sometimes really small (mashed spuds) portion. The steaks started - yes started at $32.99 and went up to nosebleed prices from there. No tablecloths, tight seating and well the atmosphere was like a big huge dining hall albeit with dark wood.
