Waltz & Weiser Saloon is a great place to become inebriated while at the Westin Kierland Resort in Scottsdale. \n\nI walked in here with about 150 other people and considering the mass demand for cocktails, the bartenders really kept up and provided excellent service throughout my visit. They have IPA on draft, which was awesome, and they pour relatively strong mixers considering this is a resort bar. A drunk golfer dropped and subsequently broke a tall glass full of Long Island Iced Tea and the staff cleaned it up in record time and even remade thew man's drink without batting an eye. Spot on service, really.\n\nThey also have a man that appears at sunset each night with a set of bagpipes and he plays a song or two to serenade the evenings arrival. This is either really cool or really annoying depending on your take on bagpipe music.
