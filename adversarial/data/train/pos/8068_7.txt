For $20 bucks, I really can't ask for anything more. Came for dinner, it's $21 per person but with the basic players card you get a dollar off. You can sign up for one for free if you don't have one. If you have one, you can get discount for you and someone else with just one card. Higher levels get a better deal, as cheap as $18 for dinner. Basic soda and iced tea included. Alcohol available for purchase. See menu photo I posted.\n\nWe came close to 8pm and waited in line for about an hour. They close at 9pm but serves food until 9:30p.\n\nVariety is a bit limited but the quality of the food is better than a lot of buffets I've been to. What I especially liked was the asian food. They had a curry, Mongolian beef and walnut shrimp that were all good. Prime rib was good too. The soft serve was not watery as I expected and was actually really creamy and good.\n\nThey also had a bbq station with chicken, ribs and brisket. The smoke on the meat was good but all lacked seasoning. \n\nOverall it was a pretty good buffet especially for the price.
