Half-way through a gruelling concert tour I was \"dragged\" here by the drummer in the band saying we need to escape our gig for something completely different.\n\nAfter schlepping our kit off the tour-bus we made our way up here only to discover a queue.  The drummer being the good Englishman suggested we queue up or go for something to eat nearby.\n\nWhich we did.\n\nAfter our respite we came back only to discover that queue hadn't been quashed.  So I succumbed and stood in line.  The drummer being 15+ years my junior suggested it \"was the proper thing to do\".  Standing in line however goes against every fibre of my being.  I'm usually the one walking in the back-alley door through the kitchen because our next set is up in 5 minutes.\n\nEventually we got in half-way through the last set (for the Sunday Band).  The drunken set where they turn up the volume to max.  Thankfully I always carry my protection wherever I go!  My etymotic musicians' ear-plugs rendered the volume to a sane and non-career threatening level.\n\nWe stood near the back trying to fit in by taking crappy flash cell phone pictures to post on Facebook.  (Trying to be cleverly ironic mocking the hipsters who do this thinking it's cool)  Alas, the pictures were CRAP!  (But that was the point)  Will they ever see the light of day?  Who knows.  They are trapped on the drummer's cell phone somewhere in South London (UK).\n\nThe bar was well stocked and had my favourite medicine.  The Sunday band played well... well enough to make me think I might just try to hear the first set with a meal before the hipsters queue up.
