Will never return. Surprised I didn't walk out as soon as I stepped in, but my daughter suggested it, so we stayed. The pictures & trophies of pigs terrified me. Even the people eating there were huge. Yikes. It's a barbecue-type restaurant & well-known for their giant slab of ribs in special bbq sauce. \n\nI ordered shrimp skewers with steamed broccoli from their 600 cal or less menu. Surprisingly, they were tastey, but nowhere near enough to satisfy me.\n\nI won't be returning.
