Don't let the shabby exterior fool you - this strip mall restaurant was once voted the best Thai food in America by the late Gourmet magazine. Reservations are definitely recommended. The chef-owner, Saipin Chutima, was voted \"Best Chef: Southwest\" in 2010. The restaurant's specialty is Issan-style Thai food, from the northeastern region of the country. The only problem you might have here is trying to choose which one of the 150 menu options to order. People who are lucky enough to eat here often spend a week researching the menu online beforehand to make the best selection.
