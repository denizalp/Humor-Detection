Had lunch here while waiting for a tire change at Kal Tire right beside. Kal Tire customers enjoy a 10% discount here. The service was quite interesting. At first I was asked if I wanted a menu. Why, oh why would you ask me that? Do you think I have it memorized or I just came to chill? Well, the waitress passed the menu over somebody's head to me - poor girl enjoying her salad. Thirty seconds after she came up to me and asked if I was ready to order. No, I don't look like a speed reader. Obviously, I was on page one of the menu. Then the lady forgets about me for the next fifteen minutes - take your time reading slow boy.\n\nThe menu claims they have the best burgers in town. And their wraps are the best. And fish & chips too. And literally everything else. Looking at the past reviews I got myself a burger with a side of greek salad. The patty was a little burnt, and I wasn't impressed with the salad either. I finished my meal pretty quickly, and then I was waiting for the waitress to come up to me and give me the bill - I think that's what usually happens in restaurants, right? Well, after waiting for fifteen minutes I had to come up to the counter and just pay there without getting the bill. \n\nNext time I go to Kal Tire I'm taking five extra minutes to walk to McDonald's.
