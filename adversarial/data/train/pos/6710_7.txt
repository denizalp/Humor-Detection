\"Come for a bubble tea, stay for popcorn\". Or something like that, I don't usually imagine bbt houses talking to me. Either way, I was pretty surprised with this small little place. The plaza is already bustling with tons of food and late night options, so a bubble tea join seemed like an obvious addition, but what sets this place apart are:\n- Free popcorn when you stay. Popped fresh from their popcorn machine. Woot!\n- Cute mix of big and little tapioca pearls. Means the chance of you suddenly sucking up a big pearl and choking yourself are slimmer, while enjoying the taste of tapoica pearls remains constant. Important math.\n- The fruit drinks here are refreshing. They're on the better end of bubble tea drinks, which is a pretty big accomplishment since the bubble tea world is mostly ruled by two or three big places here.\n- They've got a stamp card. Because who doesn't love free things?\n\nIt's a small place, so if you're going during the regular evening hours, be prepared to wait it out!
