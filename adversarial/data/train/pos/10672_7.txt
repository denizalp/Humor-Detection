I am sorry Yelpers but apparently my principles have no will power against my hunger. The stomach wants what it wants and who are we to deny it?! Ya'll gotta forgive me but they still get 3stars for bad service but 3 stars for amazing meals. I have had the salads, calamari, soups, steak, pastas etc. I have tried more of their menu than I probably should admit. \nI have come to the conclusion that their food rocks and although they need to be friendlier i may offer \"cara de culo\" a hug in my next visit. :-) \n\nYou gotta eat here! Lol i suck! \n\nAlso if you look at my pic...the container on the corner is parmesan cheese that the server left at our table so we can go cheese crazy! Other establishments take note!
