I needed to get a lipstick dupe for my mommy since she liked one of my MAC lipstick color. However, said lipstick was limited edition so it's extinct right now. \n\nI don't know how my mind thought of \"oh, lets go to Inglot and see if there's a dupe for your lipstick\" because I could've gone to ANY other cosmetic stores but I'm glad I decided to give Inglot a try. I've heard nothing but good things about their products so I was excited to pay them a  visit.\n\nI was the only person in the store and I was greeted by a male sales associate. I went to the lipstick section with a MAC lipstick shade in hand seeing if I can find a dupe for it. He was helpful and assisted me with numerous shades until we finally found one that matches PERFECTLY to my MAC lipstick. I was pleasantly surprised...I wasn't expecting to find a shade that matches 100% to my lipstick but you go, Inglot!!! I am very proud of you!!! =) \n\nI quickly did a quick browse around while thinking about what else I could get. BUT...being the good girl that I am, I decided to hold off on other items and came what I had to get and leave. =) I'm quite proud of myself for that actually. LOL. Don't worry, Inglot, I'll definitely be back!
