Although I saw the mixed reviews, I still wanted to give Comida a chance-- after all, it's the newest \"gem\" in our neighborhood. Unfortunately, the reviews didn't lie. While the parking was a perk (especially for Plaza Midwood) and the atmosphere was nice, the food and prices were anything but great. For an app, we tried something that basically resembling burnt cheese and a small portion of avocado dip. For dinner, I had the duck dish and my fianc√© had the pork belly. The duck was pretty overlooked and the pork belly was so chewy. Even the sauces didn't have the best flavor. Overall, we had a nice date night but definitely not worth $100.
