We got one and only one estimate to frame in an opening and hang double doors. I'm busy, so I just wanted it done, and they were convincing that they were the best and had competitive prices. We were offered the opportunity to pick up the supplies ourselves (he would order them and have them ready for us) in order to save a bit of money and his trouble and we would pay for supplies.\n\nWell, we had NO IDEA that the door frame was going to be pre-built by Home Depot (and since it was, why did we pay so much for the labor ($1,200)???)!!! We had arrived with our little trailer expecting to pick up pieces. The frame was HUGE and my hubby strapped it down on our little trailer and we hoped for the best. The frame adjusted while driving and my hubby had to pull over and re-strap it down, while on the freeway!!\n\nThey sent over a \"craftsman\" as they called him. When he left, the doors wouldn't close without a fight, yet his job was \"done.\" Overnight, due to humidity, the doors swelled and this time wouldn't open without a fight, and then would NOT close, even with a fight!!\n\nI called and complained and was told it was because of humidity and that it was done corrected because they sent out a \"master craftsman.\" I told them I was going to cancel my check and I was told they would put a mechanic's lien on my house!! \n\nI took pictures of the ridiculous end result of this job and emailed them. The rude idiot I talked to had to agree to refund me a small partial amount so I could hire someone else to fix it!!! That was NOT satisfactory because it turns out we paid way too much to begin with, according to the guy who fixed the problem! There was a lot of work done to fix the problem, and we had to pay him too, so we ended up paying way too much!!! \n\nI would NEVER consider using this company again!!!
