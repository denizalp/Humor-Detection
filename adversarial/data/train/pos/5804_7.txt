Some of us met here for drinks and with it being Wednesday, they offer 5 wine on all of their selections. One cannot beat 5 wine, so I decided to try a white wine why it was on the fruity side; was very delicious. They offer great deals on appetizers that usually are $10-12 are only $6. What a deal? I ended up trying the bruschetta and toast which was so good. The way the spinach was prepared was so well done. I tried their potato wedges which are so cheesy that it is running over the potato's with bacon pieces all around.\n\nI ended up taking food to go since the appetizers were so filling . For the main dinner plate I ordered the 10 oz steak which comes with garlic mashed potatoes and steamed veggies. Had to experience dessert too which I ordered strawberry cheesecake, and it even came with an Oreo crust. It was so rich that I could not even eat all of it in one setting. The steak was cooked to perfection and was so moist and thick. The service kind of lacked while we were eating there and a manager walking by noticed that we were ready to go and checked us out, but our server was the only waitress for the bar and patio area. We did not hold it against her. The Elephant Bar is such a beautiful restaurant with great art all over the place that you can experience and eat well too.
