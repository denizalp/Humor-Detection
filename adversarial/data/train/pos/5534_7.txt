I take back my comment that the wifi doesn't work. It was neither my phone or the wifi that wasn't working... It was me! Lol! Dumb humans! Lol! This airport is excellent and has exceeded all my expectations with service! Canadians are very friendly! Maybe I should plan my next trip to Toronto Canada rather than be here for overlay!
