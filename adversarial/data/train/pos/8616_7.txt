Autumn, a season that transitions from Shiki Sushi {old} into Four Seasons .\nA cool snowy season to wave Sushi you later [AYCE] and welcome the Noodle.\nWe stand upon an image (Shiki logos on the windows) of what once was Shiki, \nnow bestowed anew (New menu of mostly Korean food with Shabu Shabu).\n\nIf memory serves, an authentic Japanese Shabu Shabu I have not yet enjoyed.\nAs I encountered this, my first Japanese Korean-ish Shabu Shabu I'm amazed.\nNot by the volume in comparison to nearby Hotpots of Chinese, but by the freshness,\nthe variety and simplicity. Along with acceptable Banchan, 'twas a mighty feast. 3.5'd\n\nThe attention paid to our group of Travellers was friendly if not minimal at this late hour.\nThe Bell of Four Seasons was used more than once to retrieve our missing Maidens.\nAlas, we must be on our way, as the mighty JK needs to continue her pillage of GTA.
