Everytime I come to this location, the service is always great, only at this location though. The Sahara location isn't very good though, I mean it's BIGGER but they are very knit picky with their portions. At least the location on spring mountain gives you your own pot to cook your stuff in. \nThe service has always been great each time I've been here (which is always around 5 pm) I've always been seated quickly and the served right away! The lady that works here every time ive come in, is pretty nice and she never keeps up waiting too long. \nI like how the check in gives you free edamame so remember to check in!!\nMy favorite is the sukiyaki omg I love how they give you a whole bottle of sukiyaki sauce if you run out in your pot!\nThey offer you a pretty good portion of veggies for your pot and you don't have to share your veggies with your friend, they get their own haha \nI love to order the mushroom party and a plate of ribeye with the dipping egg sauce.\nThis swish is the best best BEST one don't go to the Sahara one, the people aren't very nice either and they Rip you off on portions and honestly the spring mountain location feels like you have more privacy to just chill and eat. The Sahara one you can be eating and staring at a stranger across from you eating and they'll be staring right back at you LOL omg.
