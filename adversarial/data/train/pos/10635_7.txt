I've been to this place a few times when I'm super duper hungover from the night before.\n\nIt's a really small, super cute diner in the village!\n\nThe service is awesome, but nothing really stands out there for me in terms of food.\n\nBut, I will definitely keep coming back here for my hangover cure!
