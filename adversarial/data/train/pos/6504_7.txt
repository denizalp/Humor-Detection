Came here last night, hg, short and sweet review is as follows:\n\nNot like Buffalo. But an oh kay copy cat.  \n\nmy bbq wings were half naked, whereas at the original anchor they were suffocating in sauce; complete fckin mess there, as it should be with wings.\n\nWe ordered 3lb, looked like the 2lb in buff, cajun rub, mild, chipotle bbq. (bf cant handle the heat).\n\nloved loved the cajun rub, it was lovely, i was expecting it to have a little bit more of a kick, but still yummy.\n\nmild was like okay, but i had set my expectations high, \n\nchip bbq: half naked , still good.\n\nanywayz, so far best wings in the gtaa, that i've had so far, but the low star rating is bc i just cant forget my eating frenzy at the origianl anchor bar. Which by the way we drove there for the day just for the wings.\n\ni like chicken wings.
