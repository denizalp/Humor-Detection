US Airways used to be right up there w\/Continental.. now they're down there\n\nI didn't even mind the fact that they started charging for their food.. \n\nBut now they're going overboard.. \n\nI didn't want to bring a heavy jacket w\/me to Cabo, so I wore a light jacket and I figured the standard blanket they give you during the flight would suffice.  I noticed there weren't any blankets on board and when I asked a flight attendant for one he said \".......yea.. for $7\" I almost started laughing cause I thought he was trying to crack a joke.   He wasn't.  \n\nIntroducing US Airways' \"nap pack\" comes w\/crappy blanket, ear plugs, inflatable neck rest , for only $7!  Use the money you were previously going to use to purchase your online crappy meal for your standard necessities!  \n\nSo I decline.. and they must crank the A\/C up ridiculously to tempt you to purchase their stupid nappy pack.. cause the tip of my nose was cold and I just couldn't sleep at all during my flight w hile I was trying cover every surface of my body w\/my stretched out light jacket.\n\nAnd you also suck cause you run out of your purchased meals...who doesn't pack enough for the flight?  You suck at even saving money for yourselves..
