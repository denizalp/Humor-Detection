Like the other reviews, Monte Carlo's layout is a bit awkward.  I was aware of this prior, so while my parents parked and unloaded, I walked from the back parking lot and to the desk in the \"front\". By far the cleanest hotel out of all the value hotels I've stayed during this roadtrip. However, we couldn't get over the odor in the hallway of the fifth floor. Smelled like a sweaty locker room which lingered into our room. Did somebody work out downstairs and decide to stop drop 'n roll  all the way back? There was a car parked in the lot which kept blaring its alarm throughout the night. I didn't try their complimentary continental breakfast but according to my father, he said it was the least expansive out of the places we've stayed out. Apparently hot items like eggs and bacon were not included and were extra charge. \n\nWe needed a place to rest our weary heads before heading back on the road. Besides the egregious car alarm that was out of their hands, it was the sweat smell that I just couldn't get over, thus gets knocked down a star.
