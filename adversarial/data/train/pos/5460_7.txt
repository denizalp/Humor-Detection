Let me preface by saying I don't drink coffee. I also don't eat many sweets. So the suggestion to go to a coffee bar that's getting known for its desserts seemed like an illogical destination for me. But me and logic have a special understanding: we don't get each other. \n\nThe chai latte was terrific and our group all enjoyed their coffee concoctions. Apparently the German chocolate cake was out of this world. \n\nCesar was an absolute doll. He showed us the patio behind the cafe and shared the improvements that will be added to open this space up and be accommodating to summer patrons; fans and a misting system will be erected. I'm not sure if there will be TVs outside or not. Since they are open 24 hours over the weekend, this should be an awesome place to end the night come summer. Or even now, really. \n\nSo on the the video aspect. *Maid in Manhattan* was on the afternoon we were there and it's amazing how much JLo reminds me of Chi-Chi from *To Wong Foo*. They will be holding an Academy Awards viewing event on March 7 so if you want to watch and don't have anyone with whom to watch, head on over. Have a chai latte; eat some sweets. Oh, and there's free Wi-Fi.
