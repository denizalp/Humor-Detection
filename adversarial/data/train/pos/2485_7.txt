This is the most overrated establishment in the Madison area. If I hear one person talk about the food and the PIE, how GREAT the pie is, I will scream. Yup.\n\nMy friend and I got there and we are waiting to be seated. We were acknowledged and asked to just step aside because a person with a walker was coming through. No problem. Then another party of two walks in and they are seated immediately. WHAT?!  We had been waiting and did a nice thing and were skipped over.\n\nSo we waited more and more. The place was cold and it was raining so the wait was even worse. Finally we are seated. Our server took over ten minutes to get to our table. When she got there, there was no greeting. She just asked us what we wanted. Wow. So much for service.\n\nSo then, we order. My order: coffee and a cobb salad. Coffee does not take too long. It took almost another ten minutes to get coffee. I am not kidding. This was probably the WORST service I have ever received. \n\nI get my coffee and shortly after my salad comes. Here is the thing, I never saw my server again until I was done with my salad. thank goodness the salad was fresh and delicious. If I had needed anything, I would have been SOL. Yeah, she never checked on us. I then ordered a piece of apple pie warmed. I was SO excited for this. PIE!  This place is \"the\" pie place. The pie was ok. And kind of pricey for being \"ok.\" $4?  No way. I can get a better slice of pie elsewhere. My server also barely warmed the pie. Needless to say I was disappointed so I just took the rest home. \n\nAll in all, that visit took nearly two hours. Yeah....Coffee, a salad and pie. They were not exceptionally busy. There was no mad rush. And I was not high maintenance. For average pie, you should pick your service up.\n\nSorry, I am not sorry, for thinking this place needs to stop relying on its reputation and provide good pie and good service.
