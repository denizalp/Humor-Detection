Mmmmmmmm Thai Hot!  \n\nThe owner\/chef (husband) is so sweet. He usually comes out to check on who orders it sooo hot & looks amazed haha!!  \n\nAnd the little waitress, Marada, is adorably awesome!! She always remember my faves & takes care of me!  Whether I'm in a rush or just taking my time; they are always very gracious & professional. \n\nIt's a quaint little place with lots of regular customers.  Even the customers are great:  I asked one of them what they ordered since it smelled so good & she was offering me a taste of her dish. Sooooo sweet!  Something I have done as well but it's great when there are others willing to share the YUMMINESS!!!  \n\nFYI:  they are closed between 230-5, Mon-Fri. Only open for dinner on Saturday. Closed Sunday\/holidays.
