Came here for lunch the other day and was shocked at how bad the service was. I stood there for about 10 minutes waiting to order for dine in and both guys behind the counter were on the phone taking orders. I get it. They were busy. But when one of them got off, he proceeded to go and make orders! He didnt even acknowledge me! As a matter of fact, neither of them acknowledged me. So I wait for another 5 minutes and still the same scenario. I left wondering what the heck were these guys doing? I know both of them saw me but did nothing. Def will be awhile before I even consider coming back if at all. That's too bad because I thought their food was really good.\n\nYelp 365 Review Challenge #142 \"Saddy's Pizza\"
