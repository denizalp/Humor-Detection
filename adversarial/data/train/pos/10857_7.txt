No. 1 Boba Tea is located inside the Chinatown Mall. If you enter in the main entrance, make a left and you will see it down the hallway. \n\nI came here with my husband last Sunday, around 1:15 pm. After browsing the extensive menu board, we ended up ordering:\n\nHokkaido Milk Tea, $4.50 tax included + Lychee Jelly $0.50 (yep, tax included)- This tea is made with green tea but I had asked if they could make this with black tea instead, which they did. I did not realize that most drinks (with the exception of the plain tea drinks) come with boba, so I added lychee jelly and declined the boba when the employee behind the counter asked if I wanted it (stupid I know, but the next time I come, I would be sure not to decline. The sign next to the cashier states that boba comes with drinks, but of course I failed to read that part... D'oh). Anyways, I also requested my drink to be made with 50% sweetener. I liked my drink with the modifications. The drink was perfect at the sweetness level. \n\nLychee Slush, $4.50 tax included- My husband opted for this drink, which it did come with boba. It also did not contain any tea. He also got his drink at 50% sweetner but thought it was still on the sweet side and would probably consider getting it at 25% sweetener in the future. \n-----------------------\n(Total= $9.50 after tax)\n\nWait time for our drinks was rather quick. We were able to try 2 teas that were out for samples (almond milk tea and a flavored rooibos tea). I thought the almond milk tea sample tasted more milk like and didn't really taste much of the tea part. I liked it but some may prefer their almond milk teas to be stronger in tea flavor. \n\nThe owner was friendly and was making small talk with us and had informed us that this tea place has been here since the 1990's. \n\nI love that this tea place is not hipster and the prices are very affordable. \n\nBut there is only 2 tables inside so this doesn't encourage patrons to stay and enjoy their drinks here. We were able to snag a table and also poach off of the free WiFi. It is password protected and so the employee behind the counter typed in the password on my husband's phone (it must be a real long and random password that he didn't want to tell us and probably easier for him to type it in). \n\nI will definitely be back here the next time I come to Las Vegas. \n\nPlease note that there are not restrooms here, but if you go down the hall, there are public restrooms in the Chinatown Mall (surprisingly the ladies restroom was decent and adequately stocked with the essentials and had running water and soap).
