I absolutly loved the museum.\nI have been saying I would go for months now and finally had the time.\nMy favorite was the prohabition section which was really great and definitely a worth see.\nI also loved the actual Heinz Ketchup & other Products section which was really cool.\nI did not realize Heinz had made a lot of the products that where there.\nI loved the pyramid of ketchup bottles all put together to make one huge ketchup bottle.\nWife and I did a yearly family membership as we can go over and over.\nI found the 5 floors of memorabilia super interesting and I would definitely go over and over again as I know i definitely missed things.\nIf in the area I definitely suggest the Heinz history museum as it is great.
