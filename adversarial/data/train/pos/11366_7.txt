This place is classic. Sit at the counter and order the smoked meat sandwich. It's unlike anything you've ever had and totally delicious. Try to get there early as this place gets crowded, but the turnover is pretty quick. This is one of Montreal's cant-miss spots. Also grab some dry rub on your way out; works great on your steaks at home. Just rub it down, grill it up, oui oui.
