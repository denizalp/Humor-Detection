this bar is awesome! Ive been coming to Bilbos for a few years now and it never fails. With an endless selection of beers to the fun game of shuffle board you will have an awesome time here. The bartenders always provide great service and the jukebox playing great music you will love this place. Why only 4 stars? it tends to get pretty smokey inside when there are a lot of people. \nOh yea! and the chicken fingers with the volcano sauce is amazing. super spicy!
