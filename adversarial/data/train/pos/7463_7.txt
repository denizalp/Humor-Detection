I've been curious about The Henry so when a friend suggested we meet here for lunch I was eager. I checked out the menu beforehand and was a little disappointed, but still went anyway. Fingers crossed for a daily special. The menu does not identify whether or not an item is gluten free. Being vegetarian AND gluten intolerant the menu seemed very small. The brussel sprout Caesar minus the croutons was good, but not good enough for me to return. \n\nThe reason for just 3 stars is the lack of notation on the menu regarding gluten\/non gluten items. I can think of at least 2 other Fox restaurants that have updated menus. Also, I attempted to order truffle fries. The very kind waitress went back and forth to multiple times only to find out there is not a separate fryer that is strictly for gluten free items. Clearly this whole gluten thing is a big deal to me, I hoped The Henry cared more about patrons with food allergies-wrong!
