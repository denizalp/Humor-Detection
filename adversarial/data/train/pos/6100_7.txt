You can't miss this place, literally. It has a retro flashing arrow pointing to the restaurant from the outside.\n\nReally enjoyed dining here. Going with a group of 4 is perfect for trying 7-9 sharing plates.\n\nMy choice for must-try dishes (in order):\n1.  Spicy tuna and watermelon ceviche - everything on this plate complemented eachother perfectly. That sauce brought all the flavours and textures together. I could've drank it... Yum!\n2.  Braised spiced shortribs - the tender meat, rich sauce, smooth pureed parsnips and yellow carrots made for a tasty meal\n3.  Truffled Japanese carpaccio - love the use of the hickory stick like chips paired with the meat\n4. Lobster ravioli (special feature) - the champagne bisque sauce should be on the menu as its own item it is that amazing\n5. Lobster tacos - liked the shell (think it was taro or parsnip), thought the mango sauce nicely offset the heat of the chili\n6. Sashimi tasting - you get to try 3 types of sashimi (2 pieces of each)\nFor dessert: Banana cake - the homemade jumbo toasted marshmallow and salted caramel sauce won me over\n\nI do not recommend the pressed poached octopus.\n\nBonus: tons of street parking and good selection of sake\n\nDiners beware: the portion are a bit small for the price and there is no beer on tap
