I've been a long time shopper at Big Lots, from time to time I go to different stores, and it just happen that I went there yesterday and I was looking for some tv stands, (they are known for low prices) so I decided to go to the store located on warm springs and Marks, I think is one of the bigger stores in Las Vegas, I was browsing the store when all of a sudden I hear a lady yelling at one of the employees with the \"F\" word and then the same woman starting to yell at some other lady, soon enough they were screaming at each other, one of the women even threatening to go outside and kick her butt !\nMy surprise ????\nthat was the store manager !!!!\nI couldn't believe that the store manager would be calling and screaming names to her employees and then take it out onto the customer !!!\nI was in total shock !\nI didn't buy anything and decided to leave, the so called 'manager' (I believe her name is margaret) was so out of place, threatening the customer to kick her ass outside the store ??? what was that about ?\ndid she think she was in jr. high ???\nI would never return to that store for long as that 'manager' is there !!! \nsomeone should report her, she's the total example of what some call \"white trash\"\nwith so many people unemployed, I'm sure that there are more educated, professional and deserving  people out there best qualified for  that job !!!
