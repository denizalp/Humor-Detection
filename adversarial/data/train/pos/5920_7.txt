Port of Subs is the same as most other sandwich shops - except how do they get pickles so thin? Seriously - they are thin and translucent. The staff is fairly skimpy with the toppings and my sandwich maker today was not proficient with the avocado scooper. The scooper is very small. He put one scoop that was about the size of a quarter on the sandwich. He attempted a second scoop, which he had to scrape around the bucket, and then fumbled the exchange as he tried to put it on the sandwich. As both dabs of avocado hit the table, he reached for the spatula. The spatula was not much better as he dropped it, and attempted to schmear the little avocado on the bread. As much remained on the handle as was on the bread. Maybe he's new? Or maybe they are just skimpy on toppings and have an inefficient staff?
