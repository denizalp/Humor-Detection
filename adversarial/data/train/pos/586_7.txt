This is a solid option for a quick lunch or late night snack.  I ordered two potato tacos and an order of Chronic Fries.  You get to choose your toppings for whatever you order which is nice.  There are a decent number of options.\n\nThe tacos were good.  The flavor was good and the portion size was ok.  The fries are a huge portion.  They are best shared by several people or multiple meals for one person.  The fries are good, and they do not skimp with the toppings.\n\nThe staff was decent and I got my food fairly quickly.
