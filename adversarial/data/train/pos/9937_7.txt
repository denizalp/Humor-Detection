Unless you read an endorsement for this tiny shop on a website that connects people with great local businesses (like, um, I dunno ... Yelp), you might never come across it. Located on Jones Avenue just south of Gerrard in a sort of non-neighbourhood (kinda Leslieville, kinda not), this shop is compact and crammed with goodies collected by the owner over the years. \n\nIt's a bit overwhelming but if you look hard (or better yet, just ask) you'll definitely find something. He also makes custom pieces from salvaged wood and materials. I scored a really, really sweet rotating barstool for $15 and a refurbished espresso coloured credenza for $80.
