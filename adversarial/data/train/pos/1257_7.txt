Yelp says 2 stars stands for, \"Meh. I've experienced better.\" That pretty much sums it up for me. However, when you factor in the price I paid, this hotel was an ideal pick. +1 star for price to value ratio.\n\n___________________________________\n\n\nDATE: Tuesday, December 13, 2011 - Wednesday, December 14, 2011\nROOM TYPE: King Room\nLENGTH OF STAY: 1 night\nRATE: $67.40\/night after taxes @ http:\/\/hotels.com (Resort fee paid upon check-in.)\n\n___________________________________\n\n\nThere are so many other nice hotels in Las Vegas that I wouldn't recommend anyone book this unless they were getting a real steal and\/or were on a budget.\n\nWhile everything is clearly modern and somewhat newly renovated, there are already some visible scuffs on a lot of the furniture. The rooms are much smaller than many of the other Las Vegas hotels.. though really the part of this hotel that makes me the most sad is the bathroom.\n\nStill, when you compare it to hotels like New York-New York or the Paris, this hotel still ranks higher in terms of decor and quality of service.\n\nLocation is good if you don't mind walking 10-15mins to get to the major casinos\/attractions. While there was a time when staying at or around the Wynn\/Venetian\/Fashion Show Mall was for me, these days I prefer to stay as close to the Cosmopolitan\/Aria as possible. The Mirage is conveniently located in between the two.
