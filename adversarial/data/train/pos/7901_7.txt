The ambiance is just ok but the people watching and entertainment factor on my night out made it ok to round up.  I didn't try the food.  \n\nOut on a rather impromptu night out we stopped in here after 10pm on Easter Eve.  Anna M. had mentioned that their website said something about appearances from Jesus and the Easter Bunny, and sho' nuff as soon as we walk in I see a  Girl wearing an Bunny head and a Jesus in a corner offering the Stations -Trials that a faithful Monkey Pants patron could go through for a few shots and a t-shirt (Facing insults, washing Jesus' feet, drinking wine from a sponge, among other things).  Also as the clock hits 1am they have shirtless shots, where everyone who takes off their shirt is offered a shot.  Now its mostly the boys doing this.  Either way it is entertaining.      \n\nThis is definitely nothing fancy about this place.  Just a down to earth slightly dive-y location where you can drink cold beer, have some food and play a little pool if you choose.  I may have to go back and try their grub here soon....
