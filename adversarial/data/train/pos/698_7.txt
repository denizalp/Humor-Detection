After working with a few shady realtors, i was about to give up on the home buying process then decided to jump on yelp. I'm so happy i found you guys, you all made the process much easier than i expected. I can't believe i was able to find a home and close in two weeks after meeting you guys. John glulch and his team is a great ethical company and proves that there are good realtors out there. Thank you Justin, John, Britney and Jeremy for helping me purchase my new home. I couldn't be more happier in my new place. I wish you guys all the success and will definitely work with you guys in the near future.
