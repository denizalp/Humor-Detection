I've been to the Brow Studio twice now and seen Noelle both times. My first appointment was for the full consultation and my second was for the brow maintenance. \n\nThe studio is clean, quiet and relaxing. And there is a giant bowl of chocolates at the front that I always make sure to sample!\n\nNoelle has incredible attention to detail and is truly a brow expert. During the consultation, I explained that I wanted fuller-looking brows with more of an arch. Even after the first appointment, I left feeling like my brows looked thicker! At the second appointment, Noelle was still aware of my goal for fuller brows and was very cautious about removing too much. The combination of tweezing and waxing is working well. I waited 4 weeks in between appointments and felt like I probably could have even waited another week or so.
