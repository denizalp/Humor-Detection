Disgusting... We got RASHES from their bedding! A group of us rented 5 rooms for a 40th birthday party...\n\nOne room had BLOOD on the sheets (not washed bedding), the other room had RITZ CRACKERS in the bed, another rooms bath tub overflowed and they had to stay in the room with WET CARPET for 2 days.\n\n I of course, saved the best for last. My significant other and myself are covered in a ichy burning rash - from head to toe!!!\n\nSo I complained to the general manager and he said they would put my room on quarantine and let me know what they find out... Thanks! I will never again stay at the Mandalay Bay... It was my first and last time there. ---\n\nI would however stay at the Planet Hollywood, Luxor and even Treasure Island. Much cleaner and cheaper! And RASH FREE! Grosssssss!\n\nThey would not take off any Money for the stay or anything!!!! (I was not looking for anything FREE, I have just had MUCH BETTER CUSTOMER SERVICE)
