THIS PLACE IS AMAZING!!!! my favorite Japanese restaurant in LV by far!!! You have to make a reservation 3-4 days prior to your arrival. When u enter the restaurant you immeditaly see the open sushi bar with a little peak hole window into the kitchen. The hostess seated us at the bar, and quickly we were asked for our drinks. \nI order anything and EVERYTHING on the menu that has uni in it. if u get a chance, and u ARE AN UNI LOVER. you MUST TRY THE PREMIUM UNI, its so cold, so sweet, and succulent..... its so good i can cry!!lol \nwe ordered a vierty of grilled meats, such as the kobe beef with wasabi, the grilled pork ears, grilled froi gras (OMG! MUST HAVE).. i ordered so much stuff i cant really remember everything.. but here's a few items on the menu i do remember being MUST HAVES ON THE MENU!!: \nPREMIUM UNI, LIVE UNI W\/ SOBA NOODLES, FROI GRAS COLD SOBA, FROI GRAS CUSTARD, KOBE BEEF WASABAI & GARLIC, BLUE FIN TUNA (when in season), GRILLED FROI GRAS, AGADASHI TOFU 2 WAYS, LAMP CHOPS, KOBE BEEF TENDON.... almost everything on the menu was GREAT!!
