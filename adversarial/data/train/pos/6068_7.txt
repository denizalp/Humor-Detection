I'd been hearing about Fair Trade for a while but for some reason, I didn't try it until just the other day... \n\nLove it!\n\nI found the staff friendly - especially Shane, who flirted with me and talked my ear off about all of the upcoming events; parking was a breeze in the adjacent lot; and although the place was packed, my friend and I scored a table outside... (good thing it wasn't crazy hot out just yet).\n\nI'll be back soon to try more than the iced tea that I had the other day... the pastries looked awesome and I need to go explore everything else that Fair Trade has to offer.  I see a future Yelp Office Hours happening at Fair Trade for sure!  Let me know if you'd be up for that?!
