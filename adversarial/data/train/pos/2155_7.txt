I have been going to the dental school for the last several months. My care has always been great. The students and faculty are always professional. The offices are clean, the wait is short. I can't say enough good about it. I would definitely recommend it too anyone needing dental care at a affordable price. Often times they finish the appointment in a very short time. Dr. Rips, a facility adviser is wonderful, very caring.
