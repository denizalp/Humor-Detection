It is dangerous that this place is so close to my apartment. This, ladies and gents, is one delicious sandwich. The roast beef with caramelized onion and provolone on baguette was amazingly delicious -- the beef was tender, and what bad could possibly be said about caramelized onions? NOTHING, that's what! Caramelized onions are always good! And having it all toasted and melty-tasty sent me over the moon. The sandwich was accompanied by a lightly dressed mixed green salad, which makes the somewhat spendy price a little bit less of a blow. \n\nNot much room to eat inside this location, so you're best getting your sammy to go.
