Innovative af!\n\nI'm uncertain how most \"roll\" but I like my ice cream enjoyable and Rolled Ice Cream is on a whole new level of creativity. The employees seem overwhelmed and to be honest I was to with the entire process.  Intriguing as it was watching the young lady create my order, the cream used to manipulate the ice cream was not as delightful as I imagined. If your \"curious\" check it out.  Once is definitely enough for this kitty! (Meow)
