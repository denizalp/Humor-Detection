If you're into vulgar adult entertainment then this is the show for you! It certainly wasn't for me. First and foremost, I don't believe in hypnosis and anything of that sort. The only other hypnosis\/mind reader that I've been to prior was Frederic de Silva at Bally's Las Vegas. I didn't do my research before attending Anthony Cool's show, but if it was anything like Silva's, I figured I would enjoy it. Boy was I wrong! \n\nThe show depended strictly on audience participation. At the start of the show when Anthony Cool asked for volunteers and he didn't get enough volunteers to fill up the seats, he stopped the show and told the audience the show wouldn't go on if he didn't get enough volunteers. I understand that if a show depended heavily on audience participation there would be no show if there were no volunteers, but to penalize those who truly just came to enjoy watching a show is not right. Think of another solution or other acts that you have up your sleeve because people pay good money to watch you on stage! \n\nAs a participant on the stage, you truly don't get to enjoy the show as if you're watching it from a seat down below. Most shows ask for volunteers for a short segment of the show, not this one! Volunteers stayed on the stage for the ENTIRE duration of the show. Some volunteers even left the stage because they were not enjoying it or did not want to participate in some of Anthony's crude requests. \n\nThis was probably one of the worst shows I've been to here in Las Vegas. I hope they take my review into consideration and take the time to revamp their humor and incorporate some real talent into the show.
