Yinz I will miss this place. I have eaten so many Sunday brunches here its kind of ridiculous- I went to a lovely bridal shower hosted here on a Saturday (they do private parties too)- and also happy food times were had.\nTwo words: PIE TABLE. Thats right your $10 brunch buys you an entree, coffee, a buffet of side dishes and a buffet of cake\/pie. I'm shedding tears right now about how $10 will buy me two cups of coffee in NYC
