This restaurant is not good. The customer service sucks and everything you order something on the menu...the waiters\/waitresses get it wrong every time. It takes so long to get your food and their Irish stew is way too salty. Yuck!\n\nI ordered a salad with my burger and I didn't get it but I got something else instead and also, on top of that, the staff wanted a tip in spite of their inferior customer service. \n\nI'm a proud Irishman and I have to say the service and quality of food at this Irish pub is a disgrace to Ireland and Irish people. This farce of a restaurant brings a tear to my eyes and leaves my stomach aching with searing pain and many visits to the toilet!\n\nFor shame! I will not return to this restaurant if my life depended on it!
