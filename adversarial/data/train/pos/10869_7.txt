To be honest, it's a good bar, but today was one of the most important days of the year for me, the day of the birth of our Lord Beyonce and I simply requested the DJ Fish to play Beyonce at midnight and I PAID him to do so, and does he? He plays a mere snipped of one lame ass excuse of a 7\/11 remix and calls it a day. Anyone in the Beyhive knows that this is the most important day of the year and as this is the 10th anniversary of B Day album, this is extremely important. DJ Fish is NOT in formation to say the least. He didn't countdown with us, he didn't put the love on top, he doesn't \"still care\". Next time I give a tip, my 1+1 +dollars hopefully will be RESPECTED.
