ALRIGHT LET ME TELL YOU YELPERS THE REAL STORY..... Frankie's Tiki Room IS in an icky part of town. The drinks DO NOT taste good, but they are strong especially the 5 skull drinks. I had a Fink Bomb which tasted slightly less crappy than the Zombie (it tasted like the ingredients were cheap)which tasted horrible, but I went there for the intoxication not the flavor of the drinks. The atmosphere was overrated, it is a bar with a few tiki decorations nothing that great, unless you sit in the booths which seemed especially made for large groups. and tiki pictures only in that corner. The continuosly running video was entertaining more so after a cocktail - definitely overrated.  The bartender had a voice that was akin to nails on a chalk board - (she was loud too). When she got off of work she sat next to me, I expected her to order a Tiki concoction with bells & whistles (literally) but what did she order??? Wait for it......... a friggin' red wine! What does that tell you hu?  Also ladies, when you go to the restroom look for the tiki head with the lipstick on it (which is the tiki head on the right if you are looking straight at the two bathroom doors). My hair smelled like smoke when I left, yours will too. If you don't mind a bar in a nondescript part of town, shitty tasting strong drinks with a tropical flair to them (they also sell regular drinks too), and a let down when you walk in the door in regards to the decor (I thought I would be in Tiki Heaven - so not the case!), then this is your kind of bar.
