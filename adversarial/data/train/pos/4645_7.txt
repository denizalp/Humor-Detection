I went there and had a evening table d'hote! \nFirst let me start by saying this place is gorgeous and they have a nice terasse! \nI started with a salmon gravlax salad then I had the lamb as a main course. Everything was really good! The lamb was oustanding! Moist and well marinated. The portions were fair and I find the menu inventive! I would go back for sure. I really enjoyed the service, the waitress was attentive and really nice. \nThis place is a hidden gem in little Italy.
