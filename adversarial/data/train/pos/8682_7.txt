Came here one night after work with my Fiancée.  Not much service as you go to the front and order what you'd like and then sit down and wait to be called. The girl who was taking our order wasn't very friendly nor did she speak much English which was ok since we knew what we wanted. We got the Waziri combo and the Chicken breast combo. I got salad and bread with the chicken breast and my fiancée got rice as well. \n\nThe salad was the best part of the meal. My fiancée said the rice was OK but our chicken was raw! we had to show the owner how raw it was and he offered to make us new ones but by then we had lost our appetites. The owner or manager was extremely nice and apologetic for the food being undercooked and gave us free meal vouchers on our next visit. Needless to say we will not be coming back.\n\nOMG, I almost forgot to mention was that the hallway by the bathrooms has the most horrific smell you could ever smell. The restaurant in general has a weird smell but that hallway would make anybody loose their appetite. Be warned!!
