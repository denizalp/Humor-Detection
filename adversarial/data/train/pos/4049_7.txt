What a fun place! First of all, they have a whole vegetarian menu! That is simply music to my ears. Amazing. I do want to point out to my fellow vegetarian eaters that there were a few items (and good ones at that) that were vegetarian but not on the strictly vegetarian menu. The cheese pancakes and bread are some examples.\n\nI am lucky enough to be familiar with many of these dishes, so I did not hesitate to try a few things. They are definitely authentic tasting and worth the awkward parking. For my main, I got the handmade Vareniki. Basically think of dumpling-like pierogies filled with just potato and onion. Served with sour cream in the middle and dill on top. I loved them! Like I said before, authentic and simple. The cheese pancakes and bread (also mentioned before) were very good as well. The cheese was sweet and the pancake was like a crepe. For dessert, I tried the napoleon cake. It reminded me a bit of the cake made of wafers and condensed milk but it was softer and a bit creamier. I loved it! I will definitely come back.
