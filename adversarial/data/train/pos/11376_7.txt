I've spent years trying to perfect my lumber-sexuality, hours of primping in front of the mirror, selecting the best flannel, grooming my beard with the sharp side of a buzz saw, standing for hours on logs in deep bodies of water, amassing an impressive mane of chest hair, painting a small calf blue to act as my sidekick, and heck, even learning the lyrics to \"I'm a lumberjack...\" backwards and forwards, yet something was missing....\n\nWhile I remained skilled with many lumberjack tools of the trade, I had yet to truly master the art of a deadly axe throw at a distance of 10-12 feet. Thank goodness I found out about Bullseys Axe Throwing in Newmarket (located about 50-100 axe throws north of Davis Drive right off of Leslie). The team at Bullseye, including owner Jonathan, were super helpful at helping me hone my axe throwing skills, teaching me a variety of different throwing techniques.\n\nThe great thing about Bullseye is that it's the most convenient, correction - the ONLY, Axe throwing sport club in York Region. This means for my fellow lumber-Jacks and Jills living east of the 427 this is super close and your GO-TO local. \n\nWhile they are by appointment only, the staff are totally willing to accommodate groups of between 20-40 with ease at your convenience as they've got 3 Axe throwing \"courts\" on premise, all done properly. Totally wrapped in floor to ceiling cages, equipped with a rubber toe stop AND using only the best REAL log targets (some other spots use a target painted on pieces of plywood) - this makes for much more satisfying 'THOCK' sound when you make contact with a perfectly placed toss.\n\nAfter a few hours in the cages, I'm feeling confident and a much more well rounded in my lumberjackery. I'm confident at my next Lumberjack meetup that I'll be able to go toe to toe with some of the best in the biz now.
