Dr. Laffa serves up one of the best laffa sandwiches in the city! His shawarma is delicious: tender, flavourful and served generously... All wrapped in fresh laffa bread that can't help but illicit memories of my trips abroad in the middle east. \n\nUnfortunately, this doctor's specialty is strictly food. I waited in line for over 25 minutes before being noticed by a server who's ability to smile was questionable. After another 20 minutes I got a table... but had to fetch my own chairs. \n\nFood came slowly and intermittently and neither entree was as-ordered. Place is loud, and fluorescent lighting resembles a fast food joint. \n\nMaybe it was an off day but there weren't too many happy patrons leaving the doctor today.\n\nDiagnosis: I would only return for take out and only before the 6pm rush. I was never a fan of cramped waiting rooms...
