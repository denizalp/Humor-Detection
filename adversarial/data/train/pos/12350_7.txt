You are now aware that Zookz makes uncrustables for grown-ups. And while you can't get a PB&J, they are delicious. \n\nI must have stumbled upon a meeting of sorts during my first visit to Zookz. About six workers stopped, looked my way, and greeted me with huge smiles. I can tell when someone is faking it, and these grins sure were genuine!\n\nI wanted the very best they had to offer, so without hesitation I went for their most popular lunch--turkey, bacon, avocado, and sweet mustard. It came with a tiny, but scrumptious side salad of kale, craisins, and walnuts. Delightful! Some say these are small, but this is a right-size lunch at a good price. Totally snagged a little jug of apple juice with my sandwich and dropped less than $9 for a satisfying meal. \n\nA fair criticism to ding a star for is that it's not as flavorful as the ingredients would suggest. Rather than an eclectic sandwich, it almost tastes like the best grilled cheese you've had in your life. I would use less cheese and probably go for something sharper, just to let everything else shine. \n\nWhoever writes the menu has some creativity and a keen palate for mixing flavors. If you're around CenPho and seeking a tasty, casual lunch, don't pass this place up!
