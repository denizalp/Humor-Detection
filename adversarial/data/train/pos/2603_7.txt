Upscale, urban and very comfortable, Provenance is the perfect place to rest after perusing the galleries. The restaurant looks out to wildlife and trees, bright in early-winter afternoon sun. The space is intimate and small, just right for a dinner for two. \n\nThe crepes were lovely, the creme caramel very light, the perch and ravioli big hits. The wine list is acceptable, though the full bar promises better cocktails. Very nice overall. \n\nHowever, the staff were a bit of an embarrassment. In the museum of art, the waitstaff should be able to pronounce their dishes (our server didn't even try to say the French dishes, and she cut me off when I ordered the crepes by their name), and more importantly, their themes. The server couldn't pronounce Mary Cassat's name correctly. In a museum. Featuring a Mary Cassat exhibit not 100 feet away and Mary Cassat menu. Really?
