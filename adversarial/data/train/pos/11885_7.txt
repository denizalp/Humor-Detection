We bought a new dishwasher from Spencer's and paid in full. When it was delivered, we noticed dents and scratches. We called the store and the manager admitted that they, without any notice, had substituted the floor demo model. He tried to blame the warehouse. Who believes the installer walked into the store, unhooked and removed the floor model without notifying someone at the store? Don Paul was our salesperson and was defensive and unapologetic. It's fraud, plain and simple.
