Very disappointed I went to this location I was told there was a grand opening on 24 Street and Thomas which I went the first day I understand they were busy so I made an appointment and when I got there waited quite a while and when she finally came out she apologized and said she would call me the following Monday well I'm going on two weeks and she never called so much for wanting my business! Very disappointed! Before you start wanting to make appointments I suggest you get your act together! Sad part is she had my number she lost it the first time and then the second time I gave it to her and she never called me! And I think she's the owner of this one name Myrna!
