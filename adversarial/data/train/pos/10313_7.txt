It's been a few months since starting at PF (ah, resolutions and their obvious cross-overs into gym discounts) and I can say they provide a solid, no-frills place to gym up.  The things you don't pay for here are what distinguish it from other gyms.  No towels, no pool, no personal dvd\/mp3\/workout-for-you machines, but for $10 a month, the yeses make up for the losses.  Their main marketing motto is my favorite part of my experience at PF: No Lugs; I don't have to watch people over do their work out and listen to them grunt about it.\n\nIf you live in the area or don't mind just doing a quick rinse with your own towel and all, then PF is right for you.  That I can cycle on my own to warm up, come in for a half hour of weights and get home in minutes makes this a perfect solution for myself, and those in my neighborhood.\n\nThe one thing I don't dig:  not enough dedicated ab\/stretching area.  It's  a little uncomfortable to do any kind of crunches\/floor stretching. There is a little area, mats and medicine balls enough to get it done, but if I had my way I'd take out the tanning machines and give the midsection a little space.
