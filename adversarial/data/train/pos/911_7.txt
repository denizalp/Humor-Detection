What a dive! But the coolest thing was that the slots still used REAL quarters. Most hotels have shifted to that fake 'ding ding' sound but at the EL, it's the real thing dropping into the tray. Now that was cool. \n\nI played some slots here and found that the machines allow you to win a lot more than at the other hotels. It was a lot of fun even if it wasn't a big win. I love hearing the 'ding ding ding' of the real quarters dropping. None of that fake sound which spits out a redemption ticket for you to collect your money!\n\nThe clientele are old, but I guess that's the charm. LOL.
