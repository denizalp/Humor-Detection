So Ive been to this gentleman's club twice, not on purpose... \n  \nBasically to get in is free the guys just need to buy drink vouchers outside. \n\nThe girls were not that good looking but I guess its dark and with a couple drinks the dark room turns into somewhat of a looking glass where your watching it from the distance. Some of the women were going up to the guys who were buying bottle service but we just sat there with our cheap drinks looking at the main stage, \n\nall and all you get what you pay for.... not much.
