WARNING!! HORRIBLE EMPLOYEE ENCOUNTER WARNING!! BEWARE\n\nThis is by far, the worst employee encounter my husband and I have EVER had. May 2nd 2018  @830 pm.\n\nGoing to the Stratosphere for the first time in 20 years, my husband and I decide to visit the property and observation deck to see the new renovations on the property.\n\nAfter buying our tickets ($20\/person - $40\/total) we headed to the mandatory security check. Told to empty our pockets and my purse, we comply. Then walking thru the metal detector, my husband sounds. Selected for additional screening, the security guard tells my husband to come forward to be wanded. \n\nOnce thru the metal detector and after wanding, the customer path leads you thru an obligatory \"photo booth\" with a 3rd party photography vendor. It was at this point my husband is aggressively approached by a \"photographer\" and told \"YOU NEED TO LISTEN NEXT TIME!\" My husband has a brief interaction with this employee where he repeats \"LISTEN NEXT TIME YOURE TOLD SOMETHING.\"  The screening security guard breaks them up and we head to the observatory deck.\n\nWhen we exit and head back downstairs we stop to ask for the supervisor on duty, as this encounter had ruined our evening and upset up both.\n\nWhen we ask the employee for his name, with a smug smile he says \"Joaquin\". I say \"Great, thanks for being an A**hole.\" And then wait for a manager. \n\nI explained what happened to the managers on duty and they apologized. However this odd and extremely offensive encounter is TOTALLY UNCALLED FOR. This failure of a pathetic employee was looking for a fight. Unprofessional and inexcusable. \"Joaquin\" should be fired for treating guests like this. \n\nHow many guests did this happen to tonight? How many times has this employee been out of line and made guests never return?
