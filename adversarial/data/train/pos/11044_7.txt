Not sure about the other two reviews, maybe they own the place, but this wasn't not a good visit.  We got there around 11:30 for lunch, not a person in the place( should have left then)!  We wait for our \"deer in the headlights waitress\" for a few minutes to seat us.  They obviously don't clean much as the place was filthy, and she seated us at a booth was dirty and didn't bother to wipe it down.  We ordered a wings, fries, cheese steak.  About two minutes later she comes back to tell us the frier isn't hot yet and it will be 30 minutes on the wings.  Change  that to a burger, but wait the fries too!  So I get some lays chips(best part of the meal).  Then I am told the ice tea has been made either.  This just went down hill, to sum it up cold burger and no taste on a cheesesteak.  Not sure how somewhere can screw that up, but this place manages to.  I would keep driving to another location if considering it.  I just pray I am not sick later!!!
