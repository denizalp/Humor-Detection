Great service. No, scratch that. Amazing service. And their bikes aren't bad, either!\n\nMy last bike was probably in grade school. You know, I had the ones where you pedal backwards to brake. I have begun to learned the modern world of cycling this year and signed up for my first sprint triathlon. JT's gave me an amazing deal on an entry level road bike.  Each new bike purchase comes with two maintenance checks you use later on and 10% off all accessories for the first month.\n\nWith each visit, I am very thankful for this locally owned bike shop and its amazing staff, JT, Jay, Eric, and Neil, for all the knowledge and help they've given. From servicing my bike to installing my new bike pedals, they have always been professional, fast, and efficient. Their prices are great, they have a great selection, well stocked with bike accessories, and store is well-kept.\n\nAnytime you need a reliable bike shop near Henderson, I highly recommend JT's. They definitely know what they're doing!
