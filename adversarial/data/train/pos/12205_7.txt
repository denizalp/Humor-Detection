One of my favorite stores at the premium outlet!  I like the variety of clothes here,  plus it's easy on the wallet.   I wish the sales signs were better displayed,  I lost out on a few discounts because of missing or non existent signs.   \n\nYou can find your whole wardrobe here.   I was able to get some tops to wear to the vegas shows and also to casually go out or wear at home.  There is a great selection of colors and sizes in styles that I like.   The clothes are similar to what you would find at forever 21, but cuter.   I wouldn't put the blouses sold here in the dryer,  I heard one of the sales girls warn a customer that shrinkage happens if you do.  \n\nThere was also a small men's section in the store with a variety of tops,  pants and accessories.  \n\nThe only thing I don't like here is that there is only one cashier,  despite several people on the floor.   There was a man in front of me in line who carried a ten minute conversation with the cashier and I was looking at the lady standing behind me like wtf.  My bf thought I got lost because it took so long to check out.   The workers are pleasant,  but please don't make your customers wait unnecessarily long when you're the only one ringing out.   I will be back.
