Whats wrong with theaters today:\n\n1. Too expensive for what you get. If the movie is crappy, tough shitzu. \n\n2. Uncomfortable seats that cramp your neck & your style. \n\n3. Tiny aisles that force you to stick either your fanny or your junk in strangers faces when you have to tinkle. \n\n4. Food that is expensive, unhealthy and not very good. \n\n5. Nonexistant customer service\n\n6. Oh yeah, and no booze!\n\nThis theater solves these nasty problems in creative & interesting ways. \nHeres how:\n\n1. You get more for your money. Its only a dollar more than other local theaters, but you get luxury seating, ushers in uniforms like the old days, & more. See below. \n\n2. HUGE recliners that go ALL the way back. Even though we were seated close to the front it didnt hurt my neck. Id recommend you sit in row H or above so youre not too close. The recliners also have little swivelling desks like in college to put your snacks on. \n\n3. Larger aisles to accompdate the larger reclining chairs\n\n4.  They have a hotdog bar where you can get a bunch of different toppings. The hotdogs are bigger than at other theaters, cost $6 (not too bad), and its rumored that burgers are on their way!\n\n5. The BEST customer service Ive ever had at a theater. I think theres nothing like putting a uniform on someone to remind them theyre there for SERVICE! Sidenote: it was really nice to see a bunch of young people with JOBS! You can tell theyre all anxious to please and make a good impression :)\n\n6. Oh yeah, and theres BOOZE! The line was pretty long so we didnt check it out in depth, but we will in the future!\n\nAll around: 5 stars! Im impressed. Great job, guys!
