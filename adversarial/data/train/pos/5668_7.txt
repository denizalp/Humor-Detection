I always go here for my haircuts. I didn't know much about this place at first but since it's right by my house, I went here and fell in love. You don't need to make any appointments. I usually walk-in and get my cuts. \n\nI usually go to Rino for my haircut. He's a jolly barber whose always willing to chat about anything. Very kind. The other barbers are friendly as well and it's like a cool men's spot. I haven't seen any women come there since all the barbers are men. \n\nThis is a very clean barber shop. They cut your hair exactly the way you want them to. I haven't had any issues and I go here every 2 weeks and have been going for the past 3 years. Great place! Price is very reasonable as well.
