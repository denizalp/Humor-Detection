Guess I didn't realize it was upscale Italian prices. Prices high for portion size ..just like Brio, but without the classy ambiance.  Ended up w\/ Pizza since we didn't want to drop 18-20 each on entrees. \nPizza was just normal. Nothing stood out, about as plain as possible. Ave amount of sauce & cheese and crust was normal. $13 for Lg cheese. Specialties were over 20. \n$8 for 2 Stuffed Eggplants (app'r) which was good. Kids meal $6 for pasta + meatball.  Rolls were complimentary but just ok.  Decor was pretty plain but nice & new. Server was nice & very attentive!  But long gap btwn app delivery & entree, pushing 25 mins.  Overall JoJo was just Average Jo.
