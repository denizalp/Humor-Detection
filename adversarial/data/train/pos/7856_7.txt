Oh lord my calorie counting is in trouble.  As I write this,  I am inhaling the thin mint cupcake. Words cannot describe the party that is going down in my mouth.  You can never eat a regular ole plain thin mint again. My love handles are going no where soon. \n\nHighly recommended.  Super cute shop.  Very friendly staff.  A little pricey but they are delicious.
