First time I've used the yelp quoting service before. Gregory got back to be within 2 hours though I sent in the question around 9 that night.\n\nWhen in the next day in the afternoon, they took my phone and in the time that it took me to walk out grab a bite to eat and come back they had my phone ready for me. \n\nQuick service that got the job done.
