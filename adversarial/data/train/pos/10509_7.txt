Don't show up at 10:13 even though the restaurants up until 11:pm because they will not seat you. Restaurant was only 1\/3 occupied. But they decided they did not want any further business after checking with their kitchen. Unfortunately we are locals and we pop in on a regular basis after movie night between 10 and 10:15 for an amazing dinner. Time to alter our plans and go to herbs and Rye. Or other amazing restaurants because Golden State in a longer wants our business. Las Vegas is filled with amazing restaurants that want your business. It's an end of an era what an amazing place like Golden Steer turns away locals 48 minutes before closing. Ouch
