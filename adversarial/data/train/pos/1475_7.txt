The name is misleading. They are not Honest.\n\nA \"technician\" came to my home to estimate two bathrooms.\n\nHe first quoted me $13, 726.00. After I said \"forget it\" , he dropped it to $10,000.00\n\nI got two other quotes from reputible companies. One for $4200 and $2700. \n\nWhen I called the Honest Plumber to tell them what a \"fool\" his person was, he didn't seem to care.\n\nStay away from this one. You're better off catching an STD then dealing with these people.
