I come here to wash our comforter since our home washer and drier aren't large enough to accommodate it.\n\nThe place is relatively clean (in fact I see the attendants cleaning it while I wait for the laundry to complete). They do have TVs, but the volume isn't loud enough to be distracting, in fact I've been studying just fine here.\n\nDisregard the few hysterical reviews stating this place is unsafe or unclean. They are patently false. It's really just code for \"I miss white suburbia\".
