It's gettin' HOT in hurrrrrr.... so take off all yo' clothes! Literally.\n\nMaybe because it was 43 degrees outside or maybe because we were sitting near an open kitchen or perhaps their A\/C died that night but it was SO HOT inside the restaurant. At first it feels a bit snugged and cozy warm, but then as more people dined in, the room temp went up, and I was sweating. Ultimately, it ruined the overall experience, and I just want to leave asap.\n\nBut I have to say, the decor and atmosphere is absolutely BEAUTIFUL. Service was spot on with great recommendations. The drink he recommended was delish - the one made with coconut and ginger syrup. The Barrata and the Pear & Walnut Pizza were delicious appetizers. The Spaghetti was cooked a bit undercooked for al dente imo, but the taste was definitely there. I was a bit disappointed with the Lamb Burger, a bit on the dry side, but the side of fresh cut fries really stole the spotlight - so good.\n\nOverall, 3.5 stars. Appetizers and drinks are great. I know Constantine is still new, and hopefully they will work out the kinks (and fix that A\/C please). I hope to be back again and try their brunch :)
