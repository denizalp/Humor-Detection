I have been going to Dr. Stile for over 4 years. I first got my breasts done with saline and Dr. Stile is concerned and caring whenever I see him.  He goes the extra mile for his patients. I also starting getting botox, juverderm plus injections in my lips and facials. The hydro facial is my absolute FAVORITE and make my skin clear and glow! All my friends were wondering how I got such pretty skin! Ask for Carol to do your facial.  Dr. Stile is also really great with scars and making sure everything looks its best :) \nCorinne S.
