The Chicken Makhani was delicious!  I was scraping the bowl to make sure I got every last drop of this luxurious sauce dish!  If you like  creamy Indian chicken butter dish, try this one!  It is THE BOMB!\n\nNancy M enjoyed her vegetarian dish as well.  There was a nice selection of vegetarian  entrees.
