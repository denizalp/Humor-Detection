Since it's been almost a full year since my initial review for Allure, and since I've probably dropped about $600 or more at this local business since then, I think it's about time for an update!\n\nI continue to drive out of my way to go to Allure (specifically Michelle and Rose although I've also trusted Nina, Richie, Lindsay, and Jen when in a bind) for my mani \/ pedis.  I always get compliments on my nails.  They are gel on my real nails but oh so much prettier and last oh so much longer than regular manis.  I keep them short so I can type, lift weights, etc...\n\nIf you're looking for a mani and\/or pedi, give Allure a call.  And if you need proof before doing so, check out my nails next time you see me :)
