I had the WORST customer service here. The waitress spilled the entire drink on me, my shirt, my jeans and my jacket. I was eating my meal soaking wet and I was extremely embarassed. I understand that accidents happen but NO ONE came up to me to see if I was okay. They didn't even offer to reimburse me for my meal! When I asked if my bill be adjusted to reflect the drink spilled, the waiter looked confused. I had to show the evidence of how wet I was for him to go ask the manager. The manager only offered to remove the drink from the bill and not my food item. Overall, the food is good, but the service is awful. Workers have a lack of common sense, and are inconsiderate and cheap! Never going again!
