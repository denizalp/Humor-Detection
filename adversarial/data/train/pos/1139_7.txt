Wow can't believe it took me this long to come here. There are two locations closer to my house but I met a friend here for a weekend brunch before work. I know this place is constantly busy with the amount of cars in the drive thru, so that's a sign of a good business. We dined on their patio which is dog-friendly, and we saw some dogs inside as well.\n\nLove that their menu is simple with healthy options that encompass all dietary preferences. I chose their nuts n' berries salad which comes with strawberries, blueberries, walnuts, and goat cheese on a bed of mixed greens and raspberry vinaigrette. It was light and refreshing, just what I needed since I wasn't feeling so great. My friend ordered their low carb breakfast, which was my other choice and she enjoyed it. I'm looking forward to trying other menu items and may visit the drive thru if it's not terribly busy.
