I saw a blast on Twitter that this market was opening today.  This used to be an AJ's Find Foods and now Good Food has taken over.  \n\nThe store is nice and clean.  They have a good sized produce department and a very nice seafood case as well.  In terms of other items they carry Annie's and Amy's products as well as other organic items. They also carry some other things that you might not usually see in a store geared to organic.  They sell Coke and Pepsi products, Oscar Meyer Lunchables, and Pillsbury refidgerated rolls like the crescent and biscuits.  They have a nice selection of things, a bakery, a deli and it look like they will have an open air deli\/bbq soon.  There is a nice little patio with tables and chairs out front.  Over all I thought this was a great addition to the area and I will be back.  \n\nThey have a nice beer and wine selection.  I picked up the last 6 pack of Blue Moon Pumpkin Ale!  Score!  I might share if you say pretty please.  :)
