Decent breakfast for cheap. Small mom and pop ambience. It's been around since... the sixties? Took Anna M and met up with my Grandma there for brunch. She started talking about back in the day they used to also hang out here and bowl at the Wagon Wheel bowling alley. Older employee chimes in and says, \"When they tore down the Wagon Wheel, we used several of there lanes for our bar counter\". \nThe food may not be special, but it doesn't suck. The biscuits and gravy are good, the drinks are cheap and the old Phoenix atmosphere is free.  You got to try once to say you've gone there.
