Lizeth at IQ TAXX is absolutely amazing! She makes it so easy to correspond with her via email during my busy work week. My appointment was so quick and painless as well. I love that she not only prepares my taxes for me, but also walks me through everything to make sure I finally understand what she is doing. In just one session with her, I feel like I learned more about taxes than I have ever known. So helpful! The rest of the staff at the office is so friendly and helpful too! \n\nI recommend IQ Taxx to everyone I know and will continue to be a loyal customer!
