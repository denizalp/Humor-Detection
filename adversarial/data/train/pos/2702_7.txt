Sushi legend isn't so legend...\n\nDon't know why there's such good reviews when there are better sushi places for people who know better. \n\nIt was a full house but the servers were not attentive. The only time they came around was when they grabbed the empty plates from our table. They didn't ask us if we wanted some more tea or soda or even how we were doing. The rice for the sushi was mushy, and the white tuna sashimi was not so white. So I was afraid to eat it. My friend also had vanilla ice cream with 4 hard white pieces (ceramic pieces?) on her first spoonful. Probably b\/c they were pre-scooped and left in the freezer for convenience. We told the manager and all he did was take it and brought her a new one without a simple apology. \n\nWe were not pleased at the end based on quality and service.
