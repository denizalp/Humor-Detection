Velvet in Vieux Port is what you get if a bunch of dangerously good-looking people commandeered the Parisian catacombs and moved out all the pesky bones to make more room for their writhing and gyrating hips. \n\nOnce you get beyond the bouncer\/guest list, pass through the lounge-y ski lodge atmosphere of the first floor and descend into the depths below, it's literally like walking into Nosferatu's lair....dank, ancient, terrible, seductive, wickedly alluring. The music here is bumping techno that courses through your veins and beats uncomfortably at your sternum. Personally, I wished that they would instead play a low key trip-hop, a smoky melody of exhilaration and dread (It'd be too much to ask for some Bartok night music, I tried to come up with a compromise). \n\nBut hey, the kids wanna dance. And after one of their drinks, that's just what I did.\n\n(Useful information: 10 dollar cover, 2 dollar mandatory coat check in the winter. Or at least these were the terms when I went at 11pm on a Saturday night)
