Abstract\nWhat is wrong with you people?\n\nIntroduction\nEvery fucking kiosk machine is broken besides one (1), and that one does not even work very efficiently (at all, really). (They claimed that they broke the night before. All of them? Seriously? Six [6] of them broke in one [1] night?)\n\nI strolled by a week later, and you guessed it, all of the kiosks save for one were still broken. I will check in a week's time again, and I am guessing that the kiosks will be not working. Hertz's tagline should read: Come stand in line for a couple of hours while out-of-order kiosks mock the value of your vacation\/time.  \n\nThe infamous lone, working kiosk\nThis kiosk says it will be a five (5) minute wait, then takes fifteen (15) minutes for the counter to decrease one (1) minute to show that it is now allegedly a four (4) minute wait. Too much math. Just give me a fucking rental car! This is the most inefficient madness I have ever witnessed from a legitimate corporation. \n\nAt this point one has to look around to see if this is one of those What Would You Do? scenarios or they are trying to make someone strangle one of these employees.\n\nCounter service\nThere are two (2) counters open and a queue that reaches the end of the roped, master line which snakes three (3) times. Can't ... be ... serious. A band of untrained monkeys could do better. In fact, I would wager money that some monkeys could be quickly trained to get all these cars hired out faster. \n\nConclusion\nHertz sucks. This was a Thursday night. Go elsewhere. \n\nReference\nOne (1) star.
