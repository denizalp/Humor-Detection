Passed by Victoria Square when we were walking in Montreal.  This town square is named for Queen Victoria.  There is a statue of her as well.  There are some trees, grassy areas, and benches here so you can hang out if you wish.  \n\nAs for my wife and I, we just entered the Metro entrance since Victoria Square is one of the Metro stops.  We continued on our journey through Montreal by walking the Underground City.
