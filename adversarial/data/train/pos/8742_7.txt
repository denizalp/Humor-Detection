So I come in the room, check underneath the bed (Anyone ELSE seen FOUR ROOMS?) check the bathtub for period, check the closets for biohazards and prophylactics....you can tell I've stayed in many a shithole in my misguided youth (and watched way too many movies about Hotels and Hostels to boot). But when I opened the window blinds and saw all the fucking OIL MARKS from people's foreheads, I just had to crack up. All the way down to the lobby. Where I canceled reservations for the next night and went across the street to Stratosphere instead. Which is weird, considering I live here in Lost Wages. The hell was I thinking.
