I have been there couple of times. Employees were super friendly. I almost tasted all of their flavored. My best one so far is the Turkish pistachio. Texture is a bit chewy. But the flavor, the hey said coming from the orchid. All natural, no additives, no preservatives!! \n\nThey also said they are expanding and will start selling gyros\/shawarma\/doners in 2 months.
