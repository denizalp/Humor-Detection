Its like the CityWalk of Las Vegas!  This part of the Strip used to be so dumpy and boring.  The best thing they did was gut out the Imperial Palace area and squeezed in the LInq.\n\nLocated between the old Imperial Palace (now called the Quad) and the Flamingo is the Linq.  The walkway is a bit narrow, but you can find all sorts of  stores like\n- Kitson\n- Dessert places: Sprinkles cupcakes, Ghirardelli Ice Cream and Chocolate Shop\n- Polariod Fotobar\n- Brooklyn Bowl\n- plenty of bars: Tilted Kilt,  Yardhouse, O'sheas\n- F.A.M.E. - Food. Art. Music. Entertainment. blends the best of Asian cuisine, including Las Vegas' own food truck: Fukuburger.\n\nAt the end of the walkway is the High Roller, which is a rotating observation wheel, bigger than the London Eye.  Its a pricy ride ($30) but tourists seem to like it.  Quite frankly you can get better views of the Strip from the top of other hotels (and most likely for free).  \n\nAnd, of course you can find Starbucks.\n\nOverall a great addition to the Strip.  That's the best part of Las Vegas, the place is always moving.
