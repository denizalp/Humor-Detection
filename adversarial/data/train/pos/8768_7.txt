This place has the freshest fish in the city.  There...I said it!\n\nIt's a must for sushi lovers who claim they've had the best sushi in the city but really haven't because they haven't tasted Penn Ave's sushi! You're even able to pick up fresh fish to fry, cook or grill.  Although nothing beats visiting the location to eat it up!  \n\nI come here so much that, yes, they know me by name and know what I order.  Sometimes I'll tear myself away from the sushi to try one of their other fabulous fish creations.  The shrimp and crab pizza, spicy tuna melt and energy salmon lunch are all winners for my fishy taste.  \n\nThe Strip District restaurant is pretty small so be prepared to hunt for a table at lunch time.  Be warned, I have been known to hover and pounce on a table if it looks as if they're getting ready to leave.  They offer up daily sushi specials which has actually made me branch out to try something different then my old faithfuls (spicy anything really).  There's also Taco Tuesday -  2 for $4.99, 3 for $6.99 or all you can eat for $8.99.\n\nAnd remember, if you're ever there it's highly likely I will be too!
