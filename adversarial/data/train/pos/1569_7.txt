First time here. Got a haircut for $30. She did fantastic. Her name began with a G I think. She took very good care of me, very friendly as well as the other staff, great haircut best I've gotten..and I get a LOT of haircuts so thats saying something. Couldn't be happier. Go to supercuts, get trash for $10. Go here, get amazing service, a great haircut, good conversation, for $30.
