There's something to be said for consistency.\n\nLike how the owner is always standing at the checkout counter, scouring the stock section of the newspaper...grumbling to himself.\nHow the same lady server has worked there for all of the twenty or so years I've been going there. \nAnd how the food never varies.\nThe same dozen or so featured items week after week, year after year. \n\nSometimes you need that.\nThe feeling that while the rest of the world is changing at breakneck speed, there's a respite from all of it. \nA place where you know you can always go where the food, the people, the ambiance will always be the same.\nIts small intimate surroundings.\nThe server, who upon seeing me knows to bring me a diet coke and does so before I seat myself. \nAnd the warm smiles from the owners when I leave.\n\nBe forewarned however. It's not fancy.\nIts very small, and can get crowded at lunch and dinner.\nBut the food will always be the same, guaranteed.\n\nThis place is pure comfort.
