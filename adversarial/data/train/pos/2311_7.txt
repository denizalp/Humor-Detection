We came here with a group of friends to go putt putting and go karting. If you print a coupon off their website you can get a buy one get one free coupon(valid on one activity-one per person). Thank God we did that because I would never pay for this place after our experience. \n\nPutt putt was ok if you like run down courses along with not being able to see your ball. Nearly half of the lights were out on the course. In addition, trash was everywhere! Do people not believe in trash cans? Also the radio station they played aired a commercial for male enhancement medicine. Ummmmmmn families are here people! Awkward as it was heard throughout the entire area!!!!\n\nWe also decided to give the go karts a try with our buy one get one free coupon. They had only 6 karts running. There was a line of about 50 people and it took us nearly 45 minutes to just get on one. Half of the go karts will break down on you, while the other half will barely make it up the hills. By the time we got off the go karts we had about 10 minutes lefts before the park closed, however the employees refused to allow us to ride again. Most employees are teenagers so you can understand how willing they were to stay an extra 5 minutes. Seriously?!\n\nDon't even both trying to get a refund here. Not worth the hassle or your time, but don't worry you can use your coupons another day. Ha \n\nThe only pro to this place is that it's cheap, but that's also a reflection on how poorly this place is ran.
