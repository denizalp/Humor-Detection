Do not do take out from here. I cannot imagine having to wait as long as we did for food. My first visit to this place. Wanted to try it out before making a trip to have eat in dinner. We love supporting our downtown Gilbert restaurants. However if I had known a roasted chicken for $21 is an anemic chicken quarter I may have chosen something else. The branzino, $22, was tasty but again small and buried under a mountain of wilted kale. \nAsparagus starter,$12, amounted to about 9 pieces, small, looked like tiny green beans and under seasoned. \nHave to wonder if this place is trying to hard to be an upscale place in the heart of Gilbert. I think a little tough with so many casual places close by that seem to fit the area better. \n\nNeedless to say most likely won't go back. Small portions, meh taste, slow service, low value for cost and almost no interaction other than \"what would you like? , ok\" 30 min later \"here you go\".
