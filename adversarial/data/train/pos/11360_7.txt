Is this real life?\n\nI'm not sure who would actually pay a cover to get into this place.  I don't even know how to describe it.  The fifteen minutes I spent here felt like an eternity & I never want to repeat the experience again.\n\nI get that it's Mill Avenue & I'm sure these places get really beat up.  But it was beat up.  Everything was sticky.  Sticky like it hadn't been cleaned in days.  The only other people in the place looked like they were still in high school.  One was wearing an invader zim backpack.  There isn't a dress code here.\n\nThe poor bartender looked depressed.  I would be too.  \n\nNever again.
