I have to agree w\/ most of the reviews that are listed about Tutti Santi!\n\nFresh Bread and butter- very good.  excellent whipped garlic butter\nThe Homemade Potato Gnocchi is excellent!! A must try!\n I've had Chicken breast in noodles, cream sauce with tons of veggies!!- great! ( Remembering names- not so much!!)  \n Tiramisu is Excellent.  It is homemade and very good.\n\nAt the end of every meal is the complementary shot  sambuca.  \n\nBIG TIME TIP  Go to http:\/\/Restaurant.com and get a gift certificate for a couple bucks and save yourself $25.  Well worth it!! (Thanks to other Yelp's who had this too!)\n\nNUTSHELL- Above average food, A little above average prices. Always a special offered, always a great dish. You will never be disappointed here!
