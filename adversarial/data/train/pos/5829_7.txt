WAIT!! Don't order your drinks yet. Request for some bread and butter first. They come in a small iron cast and may run out for the night. The complimentary bread cannot be missed.\n\nI stick to what I like, my usual red bull goose. My date, on the other hand, wanted \"heat of the moment\" that looked funky to see him drink it. I wish I took a photo on my phone.\n\nWe came with a group but we ordered for our table of 5.\n\nJumbo White Shrimp Cocktail - four okay size shrimps, tasty but won't order again.\n\nCaprese Salad - simply delicious.\n\nUltimate Steak 80 oz for 4 $165 (includes two sides and two steak sauces) - this was a lot of meat and perfect for us, 3 dudes and two chicks. We asked for medium with a nice red\/pink center. Kind of neat presentation with the bone sticking up vertically. First bite of my pre-sliced steak and I was not blown away. The steak actually needed the sauce and it tasted much better. Peppercorn or red wine reduction Worcestershire.\n\nBaked Mac and Cheese - this was really good, so heavy.\n\nBroccolini (they were out of asparagus) - I love veggies.\n\nCreme Brulee - freaking awesome.\n\nKentucky Butter Cake - good, came with a candle for the birthday girl.\n\nFOOD - 3.5 stars: This was my first visit, my date raves about the ribeye at Brand Steakhouse so we'll come back so I can try it. I prefer my steak without any sauces.\n\nSERVICE - 3.5 stars: The staff was great in clearing our plates. However, I thought it would have been kind of our waiter to comp one of the desserts for the birthday girl. After all, he received a fat tip from us. \n\nPARKING - valet at the Monte Carlo or self park.\n\nRESTROOM - careful walking on the smooth floor in your 5 incher, I can imagine a chick falling on her face. I was enjoying my buzz and walking carefully, ended up at the bar. I eventually found the nice ladies room. \n\nWAIT - no wait, made reservation on opentable.\n\nThe bar started to look like a club after 10pm. We saw a line of people waiting to get in. Cool.
