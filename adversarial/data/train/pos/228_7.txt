Came here on a Sunday afternoon. There were a few people when we came. Was impressed by the carpeted floors, nice clean layout for a small place.\n\nWe got the Mini Koo Koo bites with rice and drink. Without the drink it's $8.99. With the drink it's $11.50. I was impressed by the serving size. The chicken was very tasty and crunchy. Was very happy with it.\n\nWe also tried their Kala Kala chicken leg for $3.50. We had to wait 15 minutes before this food arrived and man the chicken was hot (temperature hot) and tasty!  Another plus!\n\nIf I would pick between the 2 (chicken leg or chicken  bites), I would pick the chicken leg. But trust me both options are great!\n\nTo drink I got their original milk tea. This is the part that I kind of was dissapointed to, as I expected the drink to have more flavor or to be a little bit more sweet, but rather the milk tea was bland for my taste.\n\nOver-all I would come back for sure! This place is cheap, got a great selection, and the food tastes really good!
