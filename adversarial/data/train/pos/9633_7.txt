I would like to tell you how terrible the food is here... that way you'll stay the hell away and leave it all to me. \n\nSeriously though, I don't even know how to explain how amazing the food is here. Best biscuit, best gravy, best mac & cheese.\n\nAfter the person sitting next to me at the counter left, I ate his leftovers right off that dirty plate (not kidding). That's how good it was.
