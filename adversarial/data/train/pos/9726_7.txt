I seriously had no what to order when I came here. My friend and I just stared at the menu for the longest time!! Haha. Of course at the vegetarian menu. Great selection, so much to choose from. Just didn't know what to order. So I LITERALLY close my eyes and pointed to one.\nI got the chili vegetables. And the palak paneer. And....I forgot the other name of the dish. But oh my gosh. I love all my dishes. Different texture for sure, not use to it. But i like it. :D\nThe staff was great, slow with our drinks, but overall it was a good place for dinner.
