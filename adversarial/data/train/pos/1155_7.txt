This shop is superb! Excellent locally owned store with a great selection of new vinyl releases. \n\nCame here while visiting and bought some records from them. When I got home to NEVADA I found one had the wrong record inside. This was a weird manufacturer\/packaging error as it was new and sealed. \n\nWell I am back a month later and told them about it and was quick to receive credit for the purchase price from them. No hassle or run around. \n\nThanks so much for the great service and for owning the error and fixing this for me even though you obviously didn't package the record yourselves! \n\nOne small thing- re some other absurd note in an old review... Who cares how they keep track of ordering their stock and in what form?!  Silliness. \nIt seems to work for them just fine, and they offer plenty of quality music for us audiophiles!
