If you have the opportunity, I highly recommend taking the tour. You'll have a greater appreciation for the history & architecture of the building and how lawmakers and politicians get the job done! Tour times are generally given every hour until 3pm and last about 45-55 min. (except holidays). You'll be taken into several different rooms and learn lots of interesting facts. A highlight of the tour for me, was being able to see the governor's conference room lavish in crimson wallpaper, drapery and paintings from floor to ceiling. At the end, don't forget to check out the 6th floor museum and observation deck open during the summer season. Externally, you can't go wrong with any location because there are great photo opportunities around every corner.
