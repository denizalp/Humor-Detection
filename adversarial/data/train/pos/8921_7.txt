Steve's is hit or miss with the service. Just know that going in. Vinny is great. The others... Meh. The kitchen takes for-ev-er. (Squints from The Sandlot style right there) I've gone times where we were the only table in the whole joint and it still takes for-ev-er.... And then the burgers were over cooked. Blegh. Whatever.  \n\nI do like the burgers from here. When they are cooked med rare like I likes 'em. Cowboy burger... drool. Actually all the food I've had here has been pretty tasty. The beer selection is pretty good and the vibe is kickin. They usually have live jams on the patio on the weekends.
