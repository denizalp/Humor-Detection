The beer selection won me over.  \n\nThis place has all the charm of a hospital waiting room.  It's not a place that you want to kick back for a few hours and drink because its so bright and uncomfortable.  Aside from that the bartender kept trying to hand me my tab when I wasn't ready to go but dammit I was staying and trying every beer I wanted to try.  Or so I thought.  The beers are strong.  At the time I went, they have an excellent selection of IPA's, one nitro which was so fucking tasty, shit dreams are made of....\n\nI can't remember being this happy about a beer selection since I was at Papago Brewery - hey now there's a place you can spend a lot of time at - take notes Angels.
