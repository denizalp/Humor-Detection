I was craving some Chinese food and it sucked that this place doesn't have oyster sauce chicken or any type of fried rice. \n\nI ordered the ham nam chicken with rice and a side of salt and pepper wings. The waiter was both the cashier and taking orders as well. He didn't seem too friendly and was quick to get our order but did not ask us what to drink at first. This place is simple has styrofoam cups for water and disposable fork and spoons.\n\nThe ham nam chicken is okay. It was bland. There was 2 sauces on the side which I thought was very tasty. The salt and pepper wings are really good though. Too bad they don't have ketchup. I eat all my fried chicken wings with ketchup. My friend ordered the chicken curry, the Naan bread was soggy and the bread is supposed to be plump. Overall this place rates as a 3, worth the price for a cheap meal!
