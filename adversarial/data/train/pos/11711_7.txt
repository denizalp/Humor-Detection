A laughably bad experience. The host confirmed my reservation for one and offered to sit me in the bar. Since I'd heard such great things about dining here for one, I wasn't worried at all. \n\nI chose a tiny booth and waited for service. After 15 minutes the bartender arrived and promised a waiter soon. He took my wine order and put in a food order of some crab claws. They were out of the wine I ordered so he gave me the house wine. Mediocre at best. But I chose to let it go and prepared for a great dinner. \n\nMany servers came and went, all promising that the next server would take my dinner order. After an hour the crab claws never came. And the myriad folks swinging by to state that \"someone with the authority to provide food would be by soon\" was simply hysterical.\n\nThen the original host -- the same guy who'd told me the bar was the best place for me -- BOOTED me from my booth saying it was reserved. I pushed back but was told I should have sat \"at the bar\" not \"in the bar\". \n\nThe owner arrived and was absolutely horrible. I offered to pay for my crappy glass of wine, but to her credit she comp'ed it. But was still quite nasty. \n\nI'm now sitting at The Wynn enjoying a perfect meal. No more Piero's for me ever again.
