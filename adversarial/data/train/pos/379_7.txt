My favorite Mexican restaurant in Pittsburgh - which by the way is a rarity. Finding legit Mexican fare in Pittsburgh is hard as it is so this place really fills in that void. \nMy go-to favorites are the tortilla soup (hearty soup with tortilla), chicken and beef nachos (i do not even like nachos but La Palapa has such awesome nachos that even im sold; loaded with veggies, beans, cheese and meat along with red mole and green verde sauce). I highly recommend their nachos! Another favorite of mine are their empanadas especially the shrimp empanada. The beef empanada is good also but the shrimp one is my favorite. \nDont forget to get a pineapple or lime Jarritos with your meal. I do miss the older location when La Palapa was a hole in the wall but im happy for their success and hope the food quality and taste stays the same.
