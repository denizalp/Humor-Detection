I love this place and have done since day one of going and am glad to see that they're doing so well. \n\nYes Snakes can get crazy busy. Due to their popularity and the size of the cafe - there are times when you're going to have to wait, and if you show up with 20 people on a Saturday night...well uh...good luck. That said, it's worth it.\n\nThe $5 sit fee is quite reasonable with walls chocker block with games to choose from. Best of all are the staff. They're absolutely awesome. Even when it's ridiculously busy, someone has always come round to check up on us, offer game recommendations and taken the time to explain new and unfamiliar games in layman's terms to us.\n\nOverall, super enjoyable experience to have people working there who are genuinely enthusiastic about board games and sharing that knowledge and interest.\n\nIt's also incredibly refreshing (as much as I love my WiFi and laptop), to go to a cafe that is *social* and doesn't have people moodily sitting in corners trying to hide their oh-so-precious-private-interneting. (ZOMG I AM TRYING TO LOOK AT CUTEOVERLOAD THIS IS SUPER S3Kr1T WORK!)\n\nWith a good variety of drinks and treats, plus alch-o-mo-hol if you really want to get your booze on while playing Settlers of Catan, all you need for several hours of intensive gaming is to hand, and priced well. And Vegan Lattes and treats? Omg. Love.\n\nAll in all, please more Snakes & Lattes - I know I would have killed for a cafe like this when I lived in Ottawa!
