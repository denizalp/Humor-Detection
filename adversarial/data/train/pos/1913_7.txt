We came here for a Free ice coffee and Caramel Macchiato for $1 on a Friday morning. \n\n- Avoid the resort fee and get your free Wi-Fi here. \n- Nice seating. Good place to take a break from it all. \n- No real complaints about the coffee since it was free. Staying at the hotel, they give you free vouchers for coffee and $2 off specialty coffee drinks. \n- Starbucks taste better. Needs to be stronger.
