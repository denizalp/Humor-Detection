Ah, I love the Vegas cheesiness of eating inside while looking like you're eating outside. \n\nWe hit up Trevi recently as part of a group dinner after a long day at the convention center. Took a table in the patio courtyard area under the faux sky and clouds. Mock statues and structures of Italy surround the dining area. The skyline rotates from daylight to twilight occasionally. Tourists walk by while shopping at the Forum Shops.\n\nIt's pure Vegas cheeze. \n\nAs for the food it's standard tourist style Italian fare. Fried Calimari was over-breaded. Linguini with bolognese sauce was just ok. The Grilled Chicken topped with lemon sauce with roasted veggies was pretty good, plus they do give you a hearty serving. Our waitress was terrific, super attentive, and helpful.\n\nThe saving grace were the delicious desserts. The gelatos and sorbets are outstanding. I had the Tiramisu Gelato and could have eaten a gallon of it! Wow.\n\nAs far as Italian food goes it was average, and there are many places in Vegas to get better. You go here for the fun cheezy Vegas ambiance after all.
