Pretty blessed location still. There's this Chinese guy with glasses that works there, I think he's named Jacky or something? Super cool dude, definitely deserves a raise and promotion. Sick guy. Also these three managers are the best: Michael, Eli and Kiffan. (They can be found Saturdays and Sundays usually in the morning or Night) \n\nFood is lit cause it's Mcds. \n\nPro Tip: ask for \"Well Done\" or \"Freshly Dropped\" for food that is freshly and completely new made. \n\nAlso get the Junior Chicken add Thai Sauce. It's blessed stillllllllll.
