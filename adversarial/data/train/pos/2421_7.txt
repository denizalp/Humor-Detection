Has to be one of the best hotels I've stayed at in Las Vegas.  The rooms are spacious, clean, and cozy.  My only issue with both my stays at their hotel is the fountain. The first time I stayed here, I felt that I lucked out with views of their infamous fountain from my room. But if you're one trying to get to bed early, the sounds of the water crashing down and the bright lights have you tossing and turning all night.  My second stay was facing the fountain as well but I was prepared with ear plug and Capt N Morgan. By the way, I cannot comment on the price because both times were paid by someone else. \n\nAs for the casino floor, Bellagio has a lot to offer. The Conservatory, Gallery of Fine Arts, conference rooms, restaurants, and their poker room are all favorites of mine.  Although, I've never had the stack or the skills to ever play in Bobby's Room, it's just an amazing feel knowing that million dollar hands are played out almost daily. \n\nIf you've been to Las Vegas, you know all about the Bellagio. If you're looking to visit, make this a stop. No expense needed for the fountain and people watching.
