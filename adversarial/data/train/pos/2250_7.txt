SCAM ALERT!! People!!! Never buy the VIP groupon for $65 for the high roller at LINQ ever!! It supposed to include free open bar and a free picture for the value of $65! I bought this groupon to use on Valentine's Day! Went there around 9 PM and they say you have to wait until 10:30 to get the VIP free open bar carriage! But when we went in there were so many carriages with the bar included that were available and I realized that is how they save money when you have bought a groupon!! After 30 minutes ride, I waited 20 minutes in line to get my free picture which was also included in the Groupon and they said come back in 30 minutes to get it while others get their pictures right away!! What a scam!! I am a local and I could have taken the same shitty ride for 30$ for two people instead of paying $65!! This is such a BOGUS  deal and never ever fall in to that!!!
