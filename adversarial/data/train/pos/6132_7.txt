Really expensive for consignment.\nEvery time I walk in, the two people behind the counter stand there looking at your every move.\nThey do not leave that counter, they do not greet you, they profile you and see if your worth there time to leave that precious counter.\nClothes are not set up by size so your having to try and search through the rack or unfold the tops while they stare at you.  Awkward.\nThey are closed on Mondays? This is not a restaurant!\nNeedless to say I agree with the creepy atmosphere and lack of customer service.
