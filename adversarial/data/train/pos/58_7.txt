Oh what a night.... I really need to spend more time here!  After a poor experience at another lounge earlier in the night, walking in to Mabel's was exactly what our group of girls needed to get our party back on track.  The music pumped us up, the upscale crowd was full of well-dressed eye candy, and we had excellent service from Holly - she kept the drinks flowing!  Greg, the manager, stopped by to welcome our group and Silas, one of the hosts, checked in on us throughout our visit to ensure we were happy.  \n\nMabel's on Main sets the bar for service in this town; I wish every place could treat their patrons this well.  But until they do, I'll keep coming back to Mabel's for a fantastic time!
