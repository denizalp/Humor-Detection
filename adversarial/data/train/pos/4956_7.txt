Do NOT go here. The salesmen are rude, pushy, sneaky, predatory, I could go on but I think you get the point. They literally SWARM your car like sharks the second you pull in, like they are going to go in for the kill. I went here last year when I was looking for a car and right when we're about to finally close the deal, the car *suddenly* is purchased by someone else...Then they get angry with you when you are actually tired of the process by this point (several hours later after all their games\/phone calls\/ \"talking to the boss\") and want to go home instead of going for the random car they decide is best for you.. As if that wasn't bad enough I went back just a few days ago (I know.. I suppose I only have myself to blame) where the salesman seemed like I was wasting his time and he ended up mocking me and telling me to go buy a Toyota. Seriously.
