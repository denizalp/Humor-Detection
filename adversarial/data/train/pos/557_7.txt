I am not a ramen connoisseur but my friends are and they love this place.\n\nMy friend had asked me to go to pmall and it was a minus 3 billion degrees cold ass day. So I actually suggested we go for ramen if he wanted to, cuz all I wanted was soup. Bet.\n\nAfter pmall we headed over as they re-open for dinner at 5pm. The place was rammed just after 5 but we only had to wait about 5 minutes for a table.\n\nI don't know the different types of ramen but my friend does. He suggested I get the misoblack but I made up my own damn mind and got the tonkotsu based on the description lol. He got the tonkotsublack.\n\nI have to admit their ramen was noticeably delicious. I've tried a couple ramen places in my life but this place was actually a standout. My broth was pretty flavourful but my friend's soup was way tastier. That garlic oil makes all the difference. Always get the garlic oil. I now know this. Also, our broths weren't too salty as other reviews have mentioned. I opted for the thin noodles as the server said the thicker noodles were a bit chewier. Noodles were great and just the right about. My friend and I were both stuffed after but I did manage to finish all the noodles. I couldn't finish the pork though. It was one or the other, or I would have exploded lol.\n\nI would defs recommend this place. I've found that other ramen places are so basic or so salty. Sansotai is a great balance and all flavours are present. This place actually made me enjoy ramen and makes me want to come back!
