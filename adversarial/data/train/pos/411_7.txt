Everything looks so pretty and neatly organized that I almost feel bad touching anything. This store reminds me of those chotchke stores that are full to the brim with candles and art work and home decor and floral EVERYWHERE and everything is expensive and you can't tell if it's for sale or if you're even allowed to pick it up, where the woman who owns the place is covered in floral and beads and stuff so she blends in with the walls. Yeah, like that. \n\nThe produce is fresh and beautiful and the meat section looks like they just cut it off the animal and the fish just flopped in from the ocean. The wine selection is wide and varied and expensive. There's oils and juices and breads and stuff I can't pronounce and wouldn't know what to do with in the first place.\n\nThe only times I ever shop here are when I don't feel like baking and need to bring a pretty dessert to a party, or when I don't feel like making my own hummus. They have a really great selection of hummus and spreads and dips with all sorts of chips and pita to go with it.\n\nEXPENSIVE. I would never shop here on a regular basis. I just don't see my self that way. You know... that North Scottsdale, I drive a Jaguar and my kid goes to Notre Dame Prep while the cleaning lady neatens my mansion off Pima and Happy Valley. Not to judge or anything, those people sure are blessed.
