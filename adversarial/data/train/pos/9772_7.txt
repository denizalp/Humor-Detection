\"It looks like a unicorn had explosive diarrhea and splattered a rainbow on a cake\" I say to my two poker buds giddy with excitement through a fit of laughter.\n\nThe \"famous\" $60 birthday cake; three layers of vanilla sponge stained with colorful sprinkles, sandwiched and topped by pastry cream, more sprinkles, and a pile of \"b'day truffles\" made from cake crumbs, white chocolate and more sprinkles.\n\n\"I'll get a knife and some...\" turning back to the two who have taken a chunk of cake each, eating it from their hand.  When in Rome.\n\nBottom line, the sponge is too dry and crumbles (day old and refrigerated?)  Every component is also far too sweet and sugary.   It is impossible to have more than a single bite.\n\nAlso sampled, the crack pie.  Think a pecan pie on steroids.  A very tasty crust containing oat flour that works  very well with the nutty, gooey butter caramel within but just too sweet.\n\nIf you're into IG worthy, uber sweet desserts at very high prices, this place is for you.  Personally, I'll pass.
