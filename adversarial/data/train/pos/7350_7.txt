This place is the sh**. It's a very small bar located inside the Grand hotel downtown. Decided to bar hop last night & our 2nd stop was here. As first timers, we were excited. \n\nWe seated ourselves at the bar and automatically greeted by our bartender, Adam. We received a BOGO cocktail for checking into Yelp! Adam was clueless about this offer and had to check with his manager first. But we Yelpers won & each got a free drink. Yay! \n\nMadison Ave $10 -- very delicious. I definitely did not taste the alcohol but I did feel it after. It had a cinnamon sugar rim that really had me goin & I hate cinnamon! But together it just complimented each other. \n\nMint Coffee Martini $13 -- the beau got it. I'm not a fan of coffee based drinks so I really didn't like it. \n\nScoobieDoo cocktail -- off the menu. It's suppose to be a shot but Adam made it into a cocktail & it tasted just like juice! I loved it. \n\nNow what really made this place memorable was the singers at the piano. They were full of character and had amazing voices. You were able to request songs for $5. It was worth it! They made jokes, laughed and sang. If they weren't there last night this place would have been a solid 3 stars, but they made me bump it up to 4. Amazing!
