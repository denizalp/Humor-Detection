If you've been to Vegas, or a casino in the islands, or Monaco -- Rivers isn't for you.  While we rate Andrew's Steakhouse as excellent in both service and food, the casino is just \"meh\".  Agreeing with Darren, the waitresses scurry around looking busy, but rarely, if ever, ask if you want a drink.  The one time I was able to flag one down, she was clearly pissed.  And, don't bother to dress up -- ANYTHING goes.  (See, e.g, \"People of Walmart\").
