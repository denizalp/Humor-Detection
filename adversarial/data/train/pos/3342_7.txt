Tom's Diner is what you expect of diner food, cheap and filling.  The help isn't crazy fast but pleasant enough, and the kitchen is open.  They also have some unique selections, which makes them good in my book!\n\nThe day I came in, I just wanted an omelette.  I think it was $7 or so, and it came with toast and potatoes!  The omelette was packed full of peppers, meat, cheese, and tomatoes.  There were plenty of toast options as well.  I wouldn't go out of my way to come here, but it is delicious all the same.\n\nThere is a very small free parking lot behind the building for customers.
