This place needs to work on the traffic flow it's way too crowded ! Went last night pre Halloween for afrojack. I enjoyed it - ish but it was so beyond crowded . It almost feels like a hazard ! I knew it would be crowded but it was ridiculous . To add insult to injury - I left my shoes at coat heck came back today and they weren't there. Coincidentally met some fellas who had just been robbed at the pool there . Hmmmm it seems a little fishy to me ?  They didn't seem to care much about said robbed people's stuff or my missing heels. I told them straight out , ( and I wasn't mad because they weren't expensive ) but I said : \" I left my shoes at the coat check with this hotels club. And today they are gone , doesn't that mean someone along the lines dropped the ball\" and I was told \" they are separate from us \" wow !!!!! I know this place is the revamped itself especially with this new edition of Pure but I'm not impressed . RIP white cute pumps !l
