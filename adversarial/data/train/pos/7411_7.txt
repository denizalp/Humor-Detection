This review is only for their burger. I've had it twice now and I must say this burger is probably one of the best burgers I ever had. The homemade biscuit is served as a hamburger bun which is nice and gives it a different texture than your typical boring brioche bun! The biscuit is nicely crisped on the edges and softer in the middle.\n\nNext the tomato jam is a nice complement adding a touch of tartness and then now let's talk about that juicy hamburger meat. The meat is not something you buy from Ralph's. It has a nice consistency with a robust nutty flavor. It's cooked perfectly (medium) and it's literally one of the best burgers ever. Just look at the picture. \n\nThe brussel sprouts are good, but they aren't my favorite. I can't wait to be back to come  here for their steaks. It can only be that much better since the hamburger meat is already BOMB!
