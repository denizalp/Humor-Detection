I'M BACK, BAYBEE.\n\nSecond visit. Third time, if you count the dinner at the original Bouchon in Napa when we got stuck in CA due to a freaking blizzard on the east coast.  But nevermind that.  This time in VEGAS, BAYBEE, for MAH BURFDAY.\n\nOh my god.  Just.  I can't even.  Birthday at Bouchon? Jesus.\n\nJust get the lamb. Whatever lamb they have that day.  Just get it.  Or maybe a steak.  And some foie.  Gotta have the foie.  And then stick it in your face and giggle to yourself like a drunk schoolgirl, because it's that ridiculously stupid good.\n\nI kinda flipped back and forth between giggling and getting weepy the whole time.  Maybe a few cocktails were involved.  SHHHHH.  Mind your own business.\n\nI love Thomas Keller.  You should too.  Just go.
