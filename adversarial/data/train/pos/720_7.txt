Udder Delights' ice creams are udder-this-world!  Heehee!\n\nI've visited Udder Delights twice already in the last two weeks, trying to use up Groupons I bought three months ago.  I've always wanted to visit UD since first trying a few samples at a Yelp event from ten years ago (?).  Seeing Groupon prompted me to try it now, and it's a bit of a drive for me since I live in north Scottsdale, but if I schedule Massage Day right, I can squeeze in an ice cream break once every few weeks.  ;)\n\nOn my first visit two weeks ago, I met Jessica**, who did FOH responsibilities, such as greeting the guests when they walk in, handing out tastings with a smile while answering any questions ranging from ingredients (allergy concerns) to delicious ice cream and topping combinations (whether it's just scoops in a bowl, cone, or waffle cone, or milkshake extravaganzas, as well as manning the cash register.  I also met owner\/ice cream flavor creator Stephanie, who really is passionate about the ice creams she produces and sells here.  Can't wait to see what new flavors she comes up with this year!\n\nAll of the samples I tried were delicious!  Seasonal ones you may want to check out before they leave to make room for new ones are Egg Nog and Pumpkin.  I haven't tried Cinnamon, but I hear that's a year-round flavor due to the fact that a couple of restaurants feature the flavor in their menus.  \n\n1st visit:\n\nTWO-SCOOP, PLUS HOT FUDGE!  I chose Coffee and Superstition Farm, and both were delicious!  The latter is hazelnut ice cream with crushed hazelnuts; riich in hazelnut flavor, creamy, and I love the added crunch factor.  It's been YEARS since I could have \"hot fudge,\" since those huge cans of hot fudge are usually made with corn syrup, so I was delighted to be able to enjoy UD's home-made version.  I wanted this presentation in a waffle cone, but knew I would be taking some home, so I elected to have the cone on the side and just crush what I needed while at the shop. https:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/udder-delights-gilbert-2?select=bUk4tLOvaOIuCrLqLOBPdw\n\nSUPERSTION FARM & COCONUT MILKSHAKE: I opted out of the milkshake base (allergy issues) and just asked to try the homemade caramel sauce, instead.  Awesome combo, but I may just go for hot fudge instead of the caramel in the future- personal preference. https:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/udder-delights-gilbert-2?select=sz5nNNngxHf6pFbc0l9LUA\n\n2nd visit:\n\nWHITE CHOCOLATE RASPBERRY & COFFEE, WITH HOT FUDGE!  Oh, why did I not just order TWO scoops of the White chocolate raspberry ice cream?  White Chocolate and hot fudge is a match made in heaven... I know this from working for TCBY in the late 80s and early 90s.  White chocolate mousse, hot fudge, \"wet nuts\" optional.  Holler if you know what I'm talking about!  Thanks to the server (sorry forgot your name!) who placed the original bowl in a larger container to keep the hot fudge from spilling all over.  THANK YOU!  :)  https:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/udder-delights-gilbert-2?select=FcbGBgIjxnzk2Ja9zbhpiA\n\nCHOCOLATE & COFFEE, PLUS GRATED COCONUT:  Delicious!  I opted out of the milkshake base, as well as the substitution suggestion of heavy cream, and just went with hot fudge (the way we used to make Double Dutch Chocolate shakes at TCBY decades ago). The UD milkshake creation turned out thick and silky.  I wished I'd reminded the server about the almonds that I originally requested, but no big deal. https:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/udder-delights-gilbert-2?select=BUTfllIrBpd2nejk4tGKIg\n\nI favor ice cream scoops in a bowl with hot fudge over a milkshake, only because I like chunky textures in dense ice cream, rather than smooth milkshake textures.  (Unless the milkshakes are more like Shivers or Concretes...)  I definitely am a fan of Udder Delight's products and will continue to frequent, with or without Groupon offers!\n\nDon't forget to check in on Yelp when visiting-- three check-ins reveal a \"free gift.\"  I'll find out what it is when I take Mom with me this week!\n\n**Was told that Jessica left due to scheduling conflicts, but the second server is equally knowledgeable of the products here, as she also does work at Superstition Farm.  I like how enthusiastic both servers were about their employer.  Kudos to Stephanie and her team!
