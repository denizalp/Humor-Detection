This is a great place to go to during happy hour. Even though the prices aren't THAT bad, it's just 10x better when paying the happy hour price!  One time at another location, we called and ordered and the let us dine-in while putting our order in with happy hour specials. That's awesome customer service!  The duck tacos are like nothing I've ever had before!  They are truly unique and definitely a must-try!  They are served mini on a bed of sour cream. They also have a tangy cream sauce inside. The coconut shrimp appetizer is also deliciousness!
