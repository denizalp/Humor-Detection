I normally avoid chain restaurants but because we were shopping all day at Legacy, our tired legs were ready to bell up to the bar and have a few drinks and eat some grub.  On a weekend night be prepared to wait a long time (upwards of an hour).  We luckily scored two seats at the bar and sidestepped the wait.  The Blueberry Mojito was killer good.  Super refreshing and not overly sweet.  Bar service was very friendly and fast.  And kudos to the CF for having a lighter fare menu...nicely done.  I opted for the beet and goat cheese salad and a side of macaroni and cheese.  The citrus vinaigrette on the salad was delicious.  The macaroni and cheese was VERY disappointing...it was swimming in oil and bland.  And it was coated in bread crumbs that tasted like old oil.  If the bar would install hooks to hang your purse on, that would be great.
