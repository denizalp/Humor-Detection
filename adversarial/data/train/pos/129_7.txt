Attended the Superbowl party here and the game couldn't end fast enough. We were packed in like sardines which made it difficult to maneuver to the restroom and the buffet. They also had an annoying DJ and host that kept talking into the game. \n\nWe were so close to each other I could taste the guy next to me farts!\n\nWe seriously overpaid thru Vegasnvip to get into this place . . . Never Again!
