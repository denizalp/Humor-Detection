Came here yesterday not knowing what to expect and everything was pretty cool.  I'm not super picky so I'm sure I was an easy sell but the woman that helped me was super awesome and nice.  \n\nTo start from the beginning you pull up to the venue and the front door is actually in the back by the bigger parking lot.  When you walk in there's a man that greeted me and asked if it was my first time here.  I said yeah and he checked my credentials (Letter\/card & I.D.) then I waited for approximately 3-5 minutes.  Then I walked in the back and that's when you get a glimpse of the buffet :) lol... \n\nIts actually pretty organized where they have the different strains and cannabis products.  The girl that helped me seemed so knowledgeable and she was super sweet.  The receptionist up front was equally nice and pretty.  My cashier\/weed consultant took my order over an ipad and then when you are all finished she brings you to a little kiosk then you throw your $$$ in then boom she grabs your receipt and boom finished.  \n\nI kept looking at the other reviews and I didn't understand why they all kept saying the wait\/line is long.... The reason why its like that is they only let 1-3 people back there at a time.  I was alone so I was the only person back there shopping.  I'm not sure if its for medical privacy or for their own security but yeah if its busy I'm sure that can be frustrating.  \n\n1st time visitors get 20% off.  Also if you check in on FB there was a sign that said free gift!\n\nThey only except cash... There is a ATM machine inside!\n\nI've only used one of the pre rolls and a edible and they were awesome .. and SUPER STRONG!
