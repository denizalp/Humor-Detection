We've went here about 5 times now and each time dealt with a different employee. Out of the 5 only one stood out for his oustanding customer service! The other don't even acknowledge you when you walk in the door. We happened to pop in yesterday while a female employee was working and you would have thought she was a customer because she was goofing off with 5 of her guy friends. I spoke to management and his response was oh we have cameras, plus she's new. I was like are you kidding me. Especially being a new employee you should be on your best behavior at work! It's too laid back no personal skills giving to staff to inner act with customers just to say Hello welcome to Zoyo, especially for their prices! I'm sticking with Scooptacular where you not only get good product but good service.
