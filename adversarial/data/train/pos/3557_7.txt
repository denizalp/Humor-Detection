I just read the reviews: a lot of hate. As usual I agree with Racheal N. She is the barometer of taste and can be trusted. My friends wanted to grab lunch today and we bounced a few options around. We ended up down at Black Dog. It is right behind the CVS and off the beaten path. There was a nice bum sprawled out on the Euclid sidewalk and he served as the guiding light. All of the dog references are adorable. I am more of a cat lover but dogs are one of the coolest animals if you ask me. The food was good. For a Sunday football game special, one pound of wings was $5 and cheeseburgers also $5. The bruschetta was also tasty. My friend and I split dishes. I ordered the Euclid Beach chicken sandwich. It was not the most exciting or flavorful sandwich but very fresh and light. It was the perfect counter balance to the other sandwich we split: The Hangover. That was a burger with egg, hashbrowns and bacon. The server was a very nice young man. I asked if I could sub out the fries for something else and he let me. I said \"Yeah, I am looking to have my urine stink today\" meaning I wanted asparagus. He didn't catch the reference and thought I was a maniac. From Wikipedia: \n\nHowever, a 2010 study found variations in both production of odorous urine and the ability to detect the odour, but that these were not tightly related. It is believed most people produce the odorous compounds after eating asparagus, but only about 22% of the population have the autosomal genes required to smell them.\n\nThe guy must be part of the population who cannot smell what this food does to your urine. Which makes me think, they should have had asparagus at the Yelp Science Center party. With all the beverages going around, we could have conducted a study on who can smell the asparagus in their urine. People who could would be considered more Elite than the others.
