Oui ou Non?  Ummm Non. Amelie's French Bakery is not quite \"une boulangerie fran√ßaise.\"  The pastries don't remind me of France or even Canada and I suspect it's because of the use of margarine as a substitute for real full fat butter.  There isn't much bread to purchase which usually is a staple at a French bakery and everything taste a bit frozen.  I feel like taking an international flight just to get a delicious pineapple coconut cream cheese ring or a simple freshly made baguette.\n\nThe Pros:\nThe staff are the nicest people ever.\nThe shop stays open 24 hours which is rare in Charlotte.\nThe food is visually appealing.\n\nThe Cons:\nThe eating area is filthy which makes me nervous about the kitchen.\nSeating is limited.\nThe decor is a tacky mix of the idea of what Paris should look like mixed with the local thrift store.\nOverpriced for quality.
