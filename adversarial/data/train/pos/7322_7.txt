I'm really happy that Hula's is within walking distance of my apartment.  This is because the tropical themed drinks pack a punch!  Me and my ladyfriend shared a \"Scorpion Bowl\" that was deceptively sweet.  We both stumbled home.  \n\nMake sure to eat plenty while drinking at Hula's - there is some excellent food to help keep one's blood alcohol level in check.  The last time I was there I had Duke's Lua plate, with slow pulled pork, cole slaw (which had a subtle wasabi flavor) and sticky rice which was amazing.  The fish is of high quality as well, though the blackened Ahi Tuna burger was a bit dry .  The burgers are excellent, with the Hula Burger being exceptional.\n\nIf you want to get drunk and pretend that you are in a tropical paradise - this is the place to go.
