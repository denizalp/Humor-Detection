This place is full of fant√°stica! Fantastic food, fantastic service, and fantastic location. Stopped by for some steak while in town for convention. \n\nDecor-typical upscale steak house look with dark wood paneling and long table cloths throughout. Bar looked well stocked and bathrooms were very clean and tidy. \n\nService-Fantastic! She was amazing and knew the menu very well. Gave great recommendations and was extremely pleasant. Just a cool place\n\nFood-Calamari app was very favorable and meat was tender and not chewy at all. Oysters were fresh and larger then I expected. The tarter sauce was also very good. The filet minion was very tender, juicy, perfectly seasoned and cooked to perfection. I enjoyed every bite until it was all gone. The crab was a bit small and the dish itself was unimpressive in size, but the awesome steak made up for the size.
