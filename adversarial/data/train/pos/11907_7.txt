Go on, rub that glitter out of your eyes. Much like the rest of Vegas, you shouldn't let the tantalizing photos fool you: It's just not that good. Don't get me wrong, I can truly appreciate what a find a full 24-page menu is at 4am. That chicken quesadilla that rolled out? At the time it tasted like a gift from the gods. On the other hand, the Dailies burger was dry and bland. I chalked the burger's shortcomings up to my own dehydration and poor decision making, then decided to give Dailies another shot during sober hours. \n\nOn my return visit I had the Turkey Avocado salad (yes, that monstrous tower of toppings that's featured in every advertisement and menu in this place), and am sad to say it was grossly disappointing. Worse yet? Of the five in our group I don't think a single one of us was happy with the meal. It was just.... ok.\n\nAppreciate Planet Dailies for the 24-hr diner on the Strip that it is, but that late-night quesadilla might be the best they can offer.
