This bank is the worst bank! I have had prepaid cards way more reliable! Also their customer service line hours are not customer friendly either. they have the worst customer service line i have ever called! If you enjoy not being able to access your hard earned money, then go ahead and sign up for this bank! they love to play with your account and play with your money. So go ahead if you dare! After some little punk hung up on me when I was stranded and could not access my card i have been through! I could tell he did it on purpose.. of course he did it a couple minutes after the phone lines had closed because he knew I couldn't call back right away. This is the kind of customer service that one Nevada provides, this is the kind of headache that one Nevada will give you... at this point, I would prefer AIDS over one Nevada!
