If you've had Halal Guys off the streets of NYC then we'll you've already been exposed to this heavenly flavor!!! As a yelper I'm all about the experience so this small chipotle like walk through the with a middle eastern touch wasn't the same as stand in a line that seems endless to only get your food and go on about your business. Oh and let me not steer you wrong the chicken isn't the same. The point is beggars can't be chooser though guys... Drum roll it's a must try especially if you've never been!! \n\nDon't eat it without the white sauce. Don't knock it until you try it. Get it to go the seating is limited. Don't skip out on the hot sauce I mean it's really hot but worth it. I can't wait to go back once the lines settle down of course.
