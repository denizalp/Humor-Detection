This place has once again come to my rescue.  My car's tire pressure warning light thingy came on and I started to panic.  All the tires looked to be in good shape but I brought the car by the shop today before work just to be safe.  The manager guy told some younger guy to check the pressure on all the tires and top them off if necessary.  Turns out a few of them were a bit low.  The whole process took like 5 minutes and they didn't charge me anything but I slipped the kid a few bucks as a thank you.  Anyway, the light went off and I made it to work safely.  I know it was not rocket surgery, but tires, pressure, and air are all mysterious to me so I'm glad this place is there.
