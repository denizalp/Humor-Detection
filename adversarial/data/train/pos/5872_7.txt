This place sucks enormous donkey nuts.\n\nThe first time I went there, I was told that the only way to use their free wifi was to load $20 onto a gift card.  Really?  Starbucks, Second Cup and Timothy's all offer wifi to customers completely free, but you're (essentially) charging me $20 as a first-time customer?\n\nHowever, I like coffee and I'm always in that neighbourhood, so I fell for it thinking I would surely spend that $20 in a month.  Only every time I went there, either the air conditioning was broken, the washrooms were covered in filth, or their wifi was down.  It was starting to become an unpleasant chore to even use up that 20 bucks.\n\nThe final blow?  I head there and order my coffee, and take more than 5 seconds to root through my purse for my card, and because there's a line-up behind me they start screaming \"Come on!  Let's go!  Pay!\"  So I finally throw them a toonie and say \"I'm just looking for my card.  Can I please have the wifi password?\"  (That's the other thing.  They change the password, so even customers who have been loyal for a year have to keep reloading the farking card to get the password.)\n\nAnd they say \"No!  Card-holders only!\"  And I stand at that stupid counter saying \"Look, I have your card.  It's a green one.  It has a balance of $11.63.  My name is XX.  You just served me 3 days ago.\"  \n\n\"Card-holders only!\"\n\n\"Then, what should I do?\"\n\n\"BUY ANOTHER CARD!\"\n\nThanks, I will buy a gift card - TO STARBUCKS.
