I would say my husband is the \"Lucky Boy\" with a wife who is more than happy to dine at such a fine establishment.  You won't find kobe beef or antelope on the menu, nor some crazy topping like foie gras.  And brace yourself, no sweet potato fries either.  But you will find a pretty damn good burger and fries for under $4!  Who knew they still even existed?\n\nThe burger is everything an old-fashioned burger should be, standard with mustard, ketchup, chopped lettuce, tomato, and onion.  And just so you don't forget we're in Arizona, they offer pepper jack cheese and green chilies.  The fries are thick cut and crisp, and they mix a mean milkshake, too.  We ate inside, and yes, it is kind of a dive, but a clean one.  It reminded me of the kind of burger joints that were around when I was a kid.  Yes, they had burgers back then.
