I took my kids downtown the day after Thanksgiving to go ice skating.  I just happened to walk passed this store filled with sparkly jewelry, belts, shoes and clothes.  I of course had to walk in.  Wow!  Two stories of beautiful accessories!  Then you take a look at the prices.  Holy Cow!  This place isn't very expensive at all.  I found myself a cute little ring, brown belt and a cute pair of earrings.  All for under $35.  \n\nI can't wait to go back!
