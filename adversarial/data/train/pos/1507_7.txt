I mother effin love this place.  I have been eating there since they opened back in 2000 or 2001.  \n\nThe breakfast burritos are the bomb, the california carne asada is unbelievable and the rolled tacos are always good.\n\nThe staff is always nice.  I love seeing this place packed, they deserve it.
