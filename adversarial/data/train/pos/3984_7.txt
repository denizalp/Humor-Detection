Given that the Opening Week crowds had subsided I thought I would try this new lunch place near work.\n\nI ordered the small mixed plate of chicken & gyro atop a great mound of bright orange rice with a salad on the side.\n\nOverall it was a disappointment. The gyro meat stung my mouth from the heavyhanded use of salt but the chicken was okay. You can get better chicken pretty much anywhere downtown so this particular recipe by the Halal Guys also got tossed into the category of underwhelming.\n\nThe salad was a mundane assembly of iceberg lettuce and chopped tomatoes. Its saving grace being that it countered the salt burn of the meat.\n\nThe rice - of which there was plenty - was bright orange in colour so I had to ask what it was flavoured or coloured with. I was met twice with the response:\n\n \"It's a secret\". \n\nThis, in the food industry is probably the worst response you could give a customer, and it made me vow to never return to this restaurant chain. Well, the secrecy as well as the cuisine, that is.\n\nI didn't finish my plate, preferring to write this review rather than finish eating their mystery food.
