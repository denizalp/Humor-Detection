The Wynn is one of my favorite hotels in Vegas, and I haven't even stayed here yet! The decor of the casino is so jaw-droppingly gorgeous. \n\nI love to just walk through the tiled casino walkways and admire the intracacies of the mosaic tile artwork. \n\nThe canopy of trees with hanging bulbs of flowers is another favorite aesthetic pleaser of this hotel. It's absolutely beautiful!\n\nLooking up, you notice the attention paid to even the ceiling, with it's recessed lighting and hanging lights.\n\nJust looking at the Wynn makes you feel like a VIP because this kind of beauty isn't seen every day (well, I guess it is if you're a dealer). It's hard to believe this beautifully interior-designed resort is in the middle of a dessert... If I didn't know any better, I'd think it was the Sultan of Brunei's palace or something!
