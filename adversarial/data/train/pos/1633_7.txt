This place is really expensive. They give you way more food than anyone could possibly eat in a meal. It tastes really good but by the time I'm done with the \nmonster salad and the giant appetizer, I am done and the sixty dollar steak has nowhere to go. \n\nI ate it anyway and I was packed to the gills. I got maybe six pounds of fries with the steak and nobody sneered at me for getting fries with a steak. French people do it, right? I ate it all. I mean all of it.\n\nI shared some champagne to wash it down but started with a fancy beer and the whole thing was gluttony and I appreciate that.\n\nIf places that give you three scallops on a plate and call it dinner bother you, go to this place and get a lot of things and you'll never be hungry again. Never ever again.\n\nThe tip was astronomical and I wish I worked there because wow does that waiter make some scratch. I wouldn't get the twenty percent he deserved but even a sympathy 10% of $300 is enough to buy a blender-full of whopper juniors and a bottle of really harsh sinus-clearing tequila. I would do that every night until I got fired for being too fat. Everyone at this place is better-looking than me, too. There's that.\n\nI have drifted from the point which is that Kevin S is wrong and this place is a bargain at any price and the food is awesome and the big crowds are because people can do something big maybe once or twice a year and this Ken Stewart's Lodge is it and you won't be looking for a pb & j wondering where your week's salary went. You'll know.\n\nWorth it.
