Every now and again, I have a sandwich on a Mancini's hoagie roll and am reminded of how godlike bread can be. So many Pittsburgh eateries choose to use Mancini's bread instead of making their own, as if they know it is futile to match Mancini's plush interior and slightly flaky crust. \n\nSomeday I shall eat a fresh-baked loaf of Mancini's bread. All I will need to go with it is a crock of warm butter and a dull knife with a rounded point. On this day I will greet Joe Black with a firm handshake and a smile.
