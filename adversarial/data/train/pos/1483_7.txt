Wow - what a fun new place on the 7th Street restaurant corridor!  We made a reservation last night and stopped in for dinner.  Beautiful decor, lively atmosphere (although the bass in the music was overwhelming), great service and delicious food.  We both started with a cider and a beer and then split the bean burrito, carne asada tacos, cilantro rice and black beans.  We sat inside this time, but definitely will come back for a patio seat next time.
