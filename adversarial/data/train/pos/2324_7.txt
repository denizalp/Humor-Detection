The new Foothills Hospital Good Earth is now located in the newly renovated part of the Foothills beside the emergency entrace (main building).\n\nThis Good Earth was previously closer to the main entrance doors and gift shop. \n\nIt looks more like a kiosk (but a lil bit bigger) as it is quite open and has constant traffic from patients, staff, and visitors coming and going. There are some comfy chairs, lazy boys, benches, and sofas in the same area where you can relax and have your coffee\/tea and treat.\n\nThey offer the same food (pastries, salads, breakfast sandwiches, etc.)and drinks as any other Good Earth and their prices are the same. \n\nBaristas that work here are really nice and accomodating. They often go above and beyond for their customers.\n\nThey also provide catering for meetings and events - all you have to do is call them in advance at least a week or two before your event.
