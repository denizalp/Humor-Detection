Fukumimi ramen's okay. I'm so used to monta I don't think I'll be able to adjust to another ramen place. What's good though is it's located (hidden) by UNLV next to Baskin Robbins. It's actually pretty good if you don't wanna drive all the way to Spring Mountain or Eastern to eat somewhere else. Their service was friendly and seating was plentiful. They have all different types of broth like miso, spicy miso, soy, etc. The bowls are about $8-$9 and it comes with pork, egg, and mushrooms. You have to add everything else for a tiny cost. We ate on a rainy day so the atmosphere made it perfect for ramen. I enjoyed my time. Just not something that's amazing. But just a-ok!
