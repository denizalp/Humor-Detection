My dad lived in Montreal back in the 70's, and every time he comes to visit here, he gets roughly eight dozen bagels. If he knows he's getting bagels from St. Viateur, he'll often borrow my mom's minivan to drive up to Montreal, to make sure they'll all fit. We've had problems at the border, a lot of US agents who have never had the fortune of going to St. Viateur think we're smuggling drugs amongst all the bagels. But no, there's really just nearly 100 bagels in our trunk. They're that good.
