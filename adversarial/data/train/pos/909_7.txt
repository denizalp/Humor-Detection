I have wanted to come check this place out ever since I saw some photos in my feed from an event organized here by the Pittsburg Yelp CM and so was super psyched when local Yelper Phil G suggested coming here for dinner.\n\nIt was easy to find parking just a block away and yay, no payment needed after 6pm. Walking into the Smallman Galley, I knew I was in for a treat straightaway - it just had a buzz and a vibe I could feel in the air! \n\nAnd I loved the curated restaurants! In one evening I had food from x3 continents! Vietnamese Ice Tea (Asia), Papusa (South America) and Chestnut Soup (Europe)! How cool was it to be able to travel the world, food-wise, without leaving Pittsburgh!\n\nSo my thoughts on food & menu as below:\n\nColonia - cuisines of Latin America\n1) I ordered a Pork Pupusa ($6.00) and this was topped with a really lovely tarty fermented slaw with jalapenos pieces that would occasionally pop up and dance in my mouth and cause me to drink up my glass of water in a gulp. I loved the fresh taste of the corn tortilla but one thing - this is a massive plate of food, so would recommend getting it as an entree to share.\n\n2) Yelper Phil G ordered the dessert plate of Churros with chocolate dipping sauce ($6.00). This came pipping hot and and I was super happy that the sugar and cinnamon taste was restrained. For me the highlight however was that dipping chocolate! Reader, I licked that bowl clean - yes, both my dining companions teased me, but I dont care. That Mexican chocolate was so lovely and whatever spices were added, it was thoroughly addictive. Absolutely Recommend!\n\nBanhmilicious\n1) I got my drink from here - a glass of Thai Tea for $4.00. I feel these guys are a wee bit cheap. I requested the Thai Tea to be without ice and rather than getting a full glass, I got a 3\/4 glass full. I was really taken aback when handed the drink and didn't query the lack of getting a full drink, but wish I had. The taste was superb, but honestly not sure about coming back here, cause I felt like I was gypped from them!! \n\nbrunoise\n1) I had the most incredible parsnip & chestnut soup with orange slices from here for $8.00, and frankly it was the highlight of my meal. I so want to go back and try everything from the menu here. They were making fresh chirozo when I ordered the soup and that smell was divine! The texture of the soup was so silky smooth and each spoonful was hearty and falvourful! The burnt orange added an incredible taste!! If you like French Cooking, then go here cause you are in the hands of a master!\n\n2) My other colleague ordered the dessert from here - a lovely Lemon Meringue Tart for $8.00. I loved the taste of the mint that was used and the concord grape sorbet was just massively refreshing and to my palate, didnt taste grape-y at all. In fact I thought I was eating something made of apples and prunes and we went back to the restaurant counter to confirm what the Sorbet was made of.\n\nOverall Verdict?? GO GO GO!\n\nPS - I thought of knocking a star down b\/c of the service received from Banhmilicious but brunoise & Colonia's food made me so happy, it overcame that lack!\n\nYelp 67\/2018
