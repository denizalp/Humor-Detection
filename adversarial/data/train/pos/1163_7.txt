The view from the bar, sitting on one of the bar stools is my favorite spot. I see people, every one! Every person coming and going! It's like a panoramic wide-angle view of the whole showroom. If getting seated on the chairs with tables, my sitting height (my body's not too long upward) require craning my neck to see over someone else's head before me to see the dancefloor or the stage. There is no weaving around the table and chairs or bumping into anyone and their chairs just to pass through either into the dancefloor when seated by the bar on the high bar stools. Although seating by the bar is not a favorable place for a behaved lady like me, the view of the whole showroom is impeccable. Easy for everyone to see me, too and that includes sitting at the dais by both sides of the stage. But wherever a chosen spot to sit, the Showroom is a favored place to dance in and to enjoy featured shows!
