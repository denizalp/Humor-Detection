Woof Gang Bakery is the most adorable pet bakery & \"paw\" spa around town. And I'm not joking when I say that all the treats look good enough to eat. I brought my kids (the real ones not the fur babies) and they literally wanted to eat the dog treats haha. \nI came here to order a birthday cake for my dog. They did such a fantastic job. It looked (and smelled) amazing. My dog will pretty much eats anything but he woofed (pun intended) this down before I had time to grab my camera. Safe to say, your doggo will love it too.\nCome check them out and spoil your fur baby, they deserve it! ;)
