After reading these reviews, I was bracing myself for the worst. That ended up being all for nothing as this was a relatively quick and easy process!\n\nDoctor sent me for some X-rays and apparently X-rays are taken by walk-in only. No appointments. Dammit!\n\nDoing my homework, it seems that Mondays and Fridays seem to be the worst days to go, so I planned my visit for a Wednesday morning. Walked through the door at 9:15 am. All staff I encountered were all friendly and efficient. After filling out new patient paperwork, giving my insurance info, and paying the co-pay I was ready for my X-rays! The nurses were all very nice and explained everything that was happening as it was happening.\n\nBy 9:50 am, I was walking back to my car feeling grateful that the whole process was already done. The place was clean, the workers were very helpful, and everything was done in a timely fashion.\n\n4 stars.\n\nYay! I'm a fan (I guess? lol)
