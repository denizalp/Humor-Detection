Used to stay here all the time for work.  Wanted to check in early around noon, but now they charge an EARLY CHECK IN FEE of $30-- really?  Thought this was a courtesy.  Check in 4pm, check out 11am, not even a 24 hour stay.  Got some $ from ATM, charged bank fee $5.99 which was stated--no problem here. Then see a $12.18 fee from Caesars when I get home--poor customer service when customer isn't aware of fees.  Table minimums really high too.  Disappointed and not sure I'd stay here again.
