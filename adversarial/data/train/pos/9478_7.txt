BE AWARE!! WORST SERVICE EVER!!\nI called them to make an appointment for an estimate of the cost. The appointment was set at 9 am, and at 9:20, their staff called me and told me they were about to come, so I waited at home until 12pm, and still no one showed up. \nAfter that, no one came nor explained to me anything, and I looked for other company for cleaning service.
