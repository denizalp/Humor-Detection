Honestly, I never go here by myself cause this place scares me, let me tell you why...\n\n1. It's always busy... always.\n2. People can be extremely pushy with their giant carts.\n3. If the person you came with leaves to go find something else in another part of the store... forget finding them till the end of your shopping trip. This place is so gigantic... \n....BUT... Woodman's is definitely worth the listed troubles. They have great prices, and they have literally everything here that you can imagine. Like a giant bag of Swedish fish :)\n\nThat being said... Woodman's has great value, helpful employees, and cleanliness.
