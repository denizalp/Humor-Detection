We came here for lunch on a Sunday. Located in the corner of Dana Park mall, this quaint little store has a trendy ambiance. There are plenty of tables set up for outside dining. This is good until the weather gets hot. We chose to eat inside. The grill area is open so you can actually watch your food being prepared. The seating is limited to several booths and about a dozen tables.\n\nOur experience was pleasant. Our waitress was friendly and the service was prompt. Pita is what this place is all about. You get pitas with your salads or used as wraps in sandwiches. I ordered a pizza which was on, you guessed it, a pita. I was a little disappointed at the selection of burgers. they were \"healthy burgers\". All were veggie burgers of one kind or another. That's good for the vegetarian, but carnivores will be left wanting that juicy medium grilled 80\/20 ground beef burger.\n\nI will say that the pizza I ordered was surprisingly tasty. I got the roasted garlic portabella pizza. This was made on an ultra thin pita like crust, which made it very crispy once it's baked. This is my favorite style of crust. There was a modest amount of sauce and cheese, which was ok by me. After all for me it's about the toppings anyway. The toppings, roasted garlic, basil, Portabella mushrooms, and thinly sliced tomatoes. I enjoyed every bite, and it was under 10 bucks. You can't beat that at most places. \n\nNow that I'm spoiled on this pita-pizza, I may not be able to get past that on the menu. I will try other items, but I want to experience the other pizzas first.
