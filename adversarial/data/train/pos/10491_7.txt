3.5 stars\n\nZumanity was my first Cirque du Soleil show, and I went in with an open mind and high expectations.  From all the hype and previews of other shows, I'm fairly certain I would have been less happy with Zumanity had I seen another Cirque show before.\n\nThe acrobatics\/contortions\/basically what you'd expect from CdS were impressive, but didn't necessarily have that \"wow\" factor.  I've gone to see Bite, which had the same swing-from-a-rope acrobat thing, and was more impressed with the Bite acrobats (though it is important to note that is where the similarities between Bite and Cirque du Soleil end...).  I kept waiting to flip out and go \"OMG HOW DID THEY DO THAT\" but all that ran through my head was \"that was cool.\"\n\nThere were bits of [naughty adult] humor interspersed, but even though it fit with the general theme (sex) of the show, I didn't think it meshed well.  The skits were all boobie humor (hilarious), while the show had a much more serious feel.  \n\nAlso, there is one segment of the show where I was uncomfortable because I thought the acrobat was simulating committing suicide.  Evidently, it was erotic asphyxiation, and it culminated in her orgasm, not death (as I had thought).  So just a heads up...\n\nI think Zumanity is best for those who have seen the \"WOW\" moments in other CdS shows, but leave your more conservative sensibilities at home....
