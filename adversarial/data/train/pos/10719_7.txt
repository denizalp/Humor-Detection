Yelp circle jerk alert! Completely average tacos. Homemade authentic style, mom and pop, tacos. Not terrible, and not memorable. Regular average flavors. Edible and definitely tacos. Nothing wrong with that, just not worthy of pulling your pants down to your knees and helicoptering your D up and down the street. Give me a break hipsters. Get over yourselves.\n\nDon't get the tacos here. Just get the gorditas.
