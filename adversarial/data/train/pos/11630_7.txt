My husband and I saw Marsena in the beginning of our relationship when having difficulties. Upon arriving to our session, we were late for the session, do to bad communication on Ms.Bryant's part on letting us know which side of the office to enter on. At the time we went to visit her, there were two entrances and two sitting rooms. Because one office was dark, and there were no signs, we entered on the East entrance which was lit and was filled with patients. After twenty minutes past our initial appointment time, Marsena came looking, and informed us that our session would be cut short due to us arriving late, although in fact we had never arrived late, and that it was our mistake that we did not enter on the correct side, the West side.  Upon entering the therapy room, Marsena immediately demanded our payment, before she would even start talking with us.  Throughout the therapy session, she did not have a positive attitude towards us nor did she sit down during the duration of the session to talk with us. He main focus was the air temperature and her appearance. Without pause she consistently walked out of the office which we were in to check the air temperature, and\/or look in her compact mirror to check on her appearance. When our session was over, she told my husband and I point black that we had no chance of making positive changes and we were a lost cause. She stated there was no reason to continue therapy. After meeting with her, we were devastated, and avoided each other. Years later we have a very different therapist and are doing very well. Had we not decided to try again ourselves and just go off of Marsena's awful advise, our lives would be in shambles. Never again will we go see her.
