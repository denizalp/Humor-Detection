I've been coming to this Loblaws-based location for years and recently stopped by, hoping to replace a broken zipper on a new-ish winter coat. This was AFTER getting a pricy quote from the Bayview tailor and being turned away by Dove cleaners (apparently they don't replace a zipper unless you also pay to have your garment dry cleaned!) \n\nThe woman who helped me has worked here for a long time and she's always friendly and professional. She took one look at the zipper, stepped away for a moment, and handed my coat back - zipper as good as new and no charge. Apparently part of it just needed to be tightened. Her honesty made my day! \n\nUnlike the staff at the other businesses, she took the time to actually look closely at the zipper itself and she must have recognized a familiar problem. I realize this is a chain of dry cleaners but I wanted to post a review because it's not every day you meet an employee like this.
