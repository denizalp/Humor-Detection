Food:\n\nIf you never had KFC before (Korean fried chicken) then this is a must order. The chicken batter is soft but there's a crunch when you bite into it. They only have two flavors but the soy garlic & the spicy BBQ pack a punch of flavor in your mouth. Another item to get is the crispy pork belly. It's a unique take on traditional Korean Sam geyop sa. It has the right combination of being salty, soft & tender but also crunchy as they leave the skin on. The combo just works. The beef ribs looked like they got cut from a dinosaur. Yes they were that big but also very soft & moist. If you had traditional Korean BBQ chicken then the fire chicken is a must. The gochu jjang, the red pepper flakes and the chicken just work well together. Honestly everything was good from the ramen Mac & cheese, kimchi slaw, and the Sriracha cracklins (pork rinds) you can taste the traditional Korean flavors but with a American twist.  \n\nLook\/feel:\n\nWhen you first walk in you notice the Kpop videos playing on the screens and blaring from the speakers. It kind of makes you feel like you're in ATL or DC. They keep the lights dim but it brings out the total ambiance of the restaurant. The original mixed drinks also has names like, \"keep pounding punch\" & \"Hornets sting.\" Let's you know that they take pride in this city & the local sports teams. They haven't got the shipment of soju in yet, but that's something that I'm excited for. Soju is like Korean vodka and it's great when mixed together. Now they do have sake as well as Japanese & local craft beer. \n\nAll in all, the food was great and the ambiance makes you feel liked you stepped into Koreatown. Since this is a new restaurant they're still working out the kinks as well as working with a menu that isn't 100% established. But from what was sampled I can't wait to go back and to tell them to shut up and take my money.
