I went to a *very* exclusive party over the weekend.  \n\nA fried chicken + donut party...in my mouth.\n\nI could dig out a thesaurus and use numerous nifty adjectives to describe their perfectly cooked fried chicken and melt in your mouth donuts, but instead I'll just repeat what numerous other Yelpers have already said; the chicken and donuts are phenomenal.  \n\nYou really have to find out what the hype is for yourself.\n\nYou can score you own mouth-party invitation by popping over to Welcome Chicken + Donuts for lunch today.\n\n(Oh, and you're welcome.)
