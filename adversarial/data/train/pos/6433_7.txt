AMAZING cupcakes! Kelly knows her craft, & does it well. She is a super nice, local business person who puts out a top notch product. What more could you ask for? Oh you want them delivered? Well they do that too.\n\nRight from their website: We offer free delivery in Scottsdale and charge a small fee for other Phoenix metro cities.\n\nThey are also at The Old Town Farmer's Market every Saturday from 8:30-1:00. Make sure to get some cupcakes while you are there.\n\nIn closing, Chocolate Brownie Cupcake with Mocha Buttercream...I dare you not to eat it & love it.
