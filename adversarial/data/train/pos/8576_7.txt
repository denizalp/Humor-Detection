This was my 8th time to Vegas and my first time at Hyde. This is a great spot. Less crowded and less douchey than Pure or Tao, and ladies get in for free. Ladies, you can also get free drink tickets from the promoters who wander the casino. It's classy, and the fountains are right there-great for Vegas first timers. The live band was amazing! It was such a good time and a nice change of scenery from Seattle. I even made out with this cute guy from Brooklyn who I'll never see again! Oops. I guess that part of the story was supposed to stay in Vegas. Too late! (Hi Brooklyn Guy if you're reading this!!! xoxo!!)
