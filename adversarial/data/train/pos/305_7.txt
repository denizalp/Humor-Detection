The Main Dish used to be a passable alternative to nearby brunch standouts: Blue Star Diner, Diner Deluxe and OEB, etc. I think I'd rather persevere through OEB's wait times than endure The Main Dish again. Given the ghost town atmosphere during peak weekend brunch hours, it looks like I'm not the only one in Calgary who thinks so. \n\nOnce upon a time, the Main Dish was known for delicious and relatively healthy ready-made meals. They are a shadow of their former selves. The menu is now truncated and the service even more so. The ingredients are exceedingly pedestrian and the portions are mediocre. Frankly, I've eaten hospital food with more flavour. \n\nI had the Florentine Benedict, described as wine and garlic braised kale (yum) but produced as undercooked weeds my four-year-old cousin would proudly produce in muddy hose water (not yum) and if the potato cheddar cake was supposed to be cooked, the ice cold center suggested otherwise. \n\nThe omelette had an odd spongy texture, resembling a kitchen sponge that's long overdue for disinfecting. Which... as a food item... is not so good, you know?\n\nThe Italian sandwich was so utterly forgettable that all I can remember was that it came with a single carrot stick and a single celery sliver.  \n\nSpeaking of sad garnishes, another plate received half a GRAPE tomato. Half. A. Grape. Tomato. So many questions. Who has the other half? Why cut it? What led to the conscious decision to only plate half a grape tomato? How is there a vegetable shortage in a restaurant that promotes itself as healthy, fresh and delicious? My eyes searched longingly around the restaurant in hopes of reuniting the two halves but... there was no one else around. \n\nIf this is \"healthy\" eating then please super size me so I can have a whole (grape) tomato. \n\nPros:\nAbsolutely positively no wait times; if you like dining with crickets, come here. \n\nCons:\nEverything feels and tastes like sadness
