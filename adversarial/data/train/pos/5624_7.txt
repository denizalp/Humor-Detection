\"If this is coffee, please bring me some tea; but if this is tea, please bring me some coffee.\"--Abraham Lincoln\n\nWhile at dinner with my Sis and BIL, the subject of Nitro Coffee happened to come up and I mentioned how I had been Jonesing for a while to give it a try. My sister swore she'd heard about somewhere in Downtown PHX that served it up, and after a bit of Yelping I stumbled upon Songbird Coffee & Tea House (SCTH). The next a.m. I was on a mission to cross this foodie challenge off my \"to do\" list. \n\nNitro Coffee- This is essentially cold-brewed coffee that you can get at most cafés, but it's then infused with pure (conflict-free) Nitrogen gas to give it a smooth finish and lightly, bubbly effervescence. There was absolutely no bitterness, and I didn't even have to add any cream because it was so incredibly creamy on its own. I loved it so much that I had to stop in another time before I left the Valley of the Sun.    \n\nService & Ambiance- Located in a quaint renovated house that's exterior is adorned in a bird cage motif with a smattering of retro patio furniture to chillax in. The interior is abound in mustache wax, beard oil, skinny jeans--and knitting?!? SCTH puts the \"hip\" in hipster... The barista on my first visit was pretty amazing; she was enthusiastic and enjoyed answering our questions about the whole nitro process and all their wares.\n\nValue- Standard café pricing. Prices didn't seem exorbitant to me, but I wouldn't consider it \"cheap\" either. \n\nI would like to have tried more of their stuff before reviewing SCTH, but just on the crave-worthy Nitro Coffee and excellent service alone I'll have to give them a solid 4.5* rating. With a 1\/2-star bump just so I don't mess up their Yelp average. Bottoms up!
