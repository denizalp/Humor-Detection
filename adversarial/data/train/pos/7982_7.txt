There must be a new girl working there who is a complete idiot. I had to repeat my order to her multiple times then verify it at the window only to get home and see she still gave me the wrong thing. I couldn't eat it and there went $7 into the trash. The crappy part is this isn't even the first time I've come here and dealt with her screwing up my order. I'm livid and never returning here again. She's ruined it for me and I use to love them.
