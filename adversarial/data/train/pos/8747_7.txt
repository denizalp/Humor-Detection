The delivery form that Canpar provides to authorize the driver to leave the parcel in a specific location or with a specific person is not available to those who live in apartments and condos - and it is now clearly printed on the form.  Fortunately, I live in a townhouse and the driver left my parcel exactly where I requested it be left.  Shippers should convey that information to customers ordering items and have other shipping options available.  It is likely that Canpar cannot offer the delivery form option for apartment\/condo residents for liability\/insurance reasons, which is understandable.  However, the fact that their pickup location is usually not conveniently located and not open evenings and weekends is something that shippers should really take into consideration before choosing the method of delivery.  For me, the delivery worked out perfectly.  Thanks, Canpar.
