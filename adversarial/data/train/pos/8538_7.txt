When it comes to airport food, there generally aren't many great options. It's usually a mixture of chain restaurant or something of equal or lesser quality. Then there's Beaudevin.\n\nI don't know where this place came from. I can't even find a website. It's almost like it was quietly placed here by a divine Airport God as our reward for dealing with TSA's across the lands. This is easily the best and fanciest place I've eaten at Any airport. \n\nI ordered a bagel with a side of all the necessary ingredients for a lox bagel combination creation (herbed cream cheese, capers, red onions, tomatoes and smoked salmon). Everything tasted fresh enough for my liking. The salmon was great. Mind. Blown. \n\nIf you're flying into Charlotte and have some time to spare, check it out. I read they also have one in Chicago O' Hare and Miami. Travelers rejoice!
