Ideal for lunches, a casual fast service, seat yourself Vietnamese restaurant. The spring rolls were pretty tasty. Not fresh, I could tell the wrappers were a little chewy, but the peanut sauce was tasty. The pho was good but not great. The meatballs were hearty and I liked the ample helping of green onions, but the steak was pretty dry and the broth was watered down and sorely in need of spice. \n\nTip: the pho is better than second day if you put the jalapeno slices they give you in the broth and let it marinate overnight
