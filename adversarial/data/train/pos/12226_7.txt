Had become disenchanted with the Waterfront location so I wanted to give a different shop a try. Went in with a groupon and was all set for a five minute scalp massage, hair treatment mask and a fantastic blowout (as advertised) . I've had many before and have come to expect a pretty decent standard. I walked away with a 90 second scalp massage, no treatment mask, unconditioned, wet hair that was a tangled mess and finished hair that had no style and frizz. The girl doing my hair couldn't manage to get a comb through it once she had me in the chair. I informed her that conditioner would help and she told me she used spray conditioner - kept yanking the comb through and had to take brushing advice from the stylist next to her. The worst part of the experience was the customer service. Front desk knew I wasn't happy and let me walk out, so I took it a step further and emailed the store. Still no response days later. What a disappointment. If you're going to advertise specifics on a Groupon, adhere to them. I feel like corporate chains are really losing out to small businesses when it comes to customer service. These places just don't care anymore.
