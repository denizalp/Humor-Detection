I was very disappointed with this particular Oregano's location (Scottsdale at Shea). Although the food was very good, the service was lacking. \n\nInitially, our waitress was prompt with bringing beverages out. However, after our meal was delivered, our waitress disappeared; we never see her again. We inquire to another waiter, who then lets us know that our waitress had taken a break. \n\nNonetheless, the food was good. My four favorites are the \"Italian Gold wings,\" \"Numero One-O,\" \"Bistro Sweet Po's,\" and French Fries. \n\nThe Italian Gold wings are chicken wings cooked with a honey mustard BBQ sauce. The Numero One-O is a stuffed pizza with sausage, pepperoni, mushrooms, onions, and green onions. \n\nThe Bistro Sweet Po's are sweet potato fries. And as for the French Fries, they are crispy and ruffled! \n\nOh yes, and DO try the dessert. I recommend the Chocolate Chip dessert, which is essentially a hot pizza cookie -- made entirely of chocolate chip. \n\nPrices from about $5 to $9 for appetizers. Pizza prices range from about $14 to $23. \n\nThere are also lasagnas, pastas, and sandwiches -- all of which are good.
