Oh boy.\nYou know those sentimental photos of a single flower breaking through a world of concrete? Life springing up in an urban wasteland! That's actually what Sam James is to The PATH. \n\nI first heard about this place a week ago; after listening to me complain about the lack of great coffee options in the financial district (it doesn't make sense! this is a neighbourhood fueled by caffeine and overrun with yuppies!) a friend informed me that his favourite indie coffee joint had just opened up shop in the bottom of the SunLife bulding. \n\nWednesday morning, and its time I check it out. With sunglasses lowered and a slightly shaky demeanor, I weave my way around Thai Express and Tim Hortons to this haven--this sanctem--this refuge of the bean. I approach the counter and slowly remove the shades to review the limited menu: Espresso\/Americano\/Cappucino\/Machiatto. My sigh of happiness eases into a deep inhale: Oh boy. The smell of this place alone can cure a hangover! \n\nThere's great music playing, the barristas seem relaxed and happy. I order my Americano. I pay for my Americano (CASH ONLY). I receive my Americano. I sip my Americano. Oh. Boy. \n\n\"Roomie? It's me. I just cried. Ya. A coffee. No really. It brought tears to my eyes. Ya, that's all. I just had to share that with someone. OK bye.\"
