This is one of my favorite places in Vegas!  I sort of have a routine - I arrive in Vegas on Friday around midnight.  I give my bag to some hotel checker, hit up Bill's for the cheapest craps, and wait for Drai's to open up around 2am.  As soon as Drai's opens, I get my stamp, and go back to gambling, because Drai's gets good at about 3-4am when all the true fuckups and drunks roll in (including me).  If it weren't for Drai's, I'd actually have to get a hotel room for my first night in Vegas.
