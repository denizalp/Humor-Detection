Great Place to Watch a Game\n\nThis park is beautiful and spacious.  Every seat has a great, close view. There is an intimate feel, we have gotten many autographs and photographs.  \n\nThe park offers free parking and the easy in\/out with minimal traffic, is a bonus.  Only drawback is there is very minimal shade, so bring mist fans and lots of sunscreen.  \n\nThe food is okay, nothing soecial, and very pricey, like most parks. I try to always bring frozen water bottles and snacks.  On every trip we visit the store to pick out some fun new Spring Training apparel at reasonable prices.\n\nIf you're looking to attend a game, stop by, very enjoyable.
