Holyyy....holy....cow! I never had gam ja tang (pork stew, I think this is the same dish the previous reviewer was writing about) before in my life and this is what the restaurant is known for.  My korean friend told me they boil it in the morning, they basically cook it way in advance so that it's very tender and ready to eat! \n\nOrder that if you can eat pork...and if you don't? Well you are missing out!! The broth was not as spicy as I thought and it was just delicious! Warning, the menu says it is for 2 people, but we were 4 and we didnt eat 2 pieces of it with some broth leftover. Our friend had to take it home.\n\nWe also ordered the Korean \"sausage\" which is apparently intestines and noodles as well as other ingredients mixed together. It didn't have a sausage texture though it definitely looked like one. That was also not as spicy as I thought.\n\nMy recommendations? Order the gam ja tang. It's a must!  Service was also generally pleasant.
