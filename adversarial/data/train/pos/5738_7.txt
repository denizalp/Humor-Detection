Ditch Fridays, the calmer cousin of Hard Rock's Rehab Sundays. I think they wind down in September but was here over Labor Day weekend. You have to experience it, once, twice, maybe a few more times. Women were beautiful, and some men - don't let anyone say that when you're in your mid-40's you can't maintain a six-pack. 90% of all guests here were in fantastic shape. The women who are beyond-blessed, some wear g-strings and lower them below the areas there supposed to be covering, but no-one seemed offended?? Seriously, drinking shots at 12:30 PM to about 7 PM is one hell of a way to pre-game for the night festivities. Didn't get to the VIP cabanas, they were all taken ,but did see a GUY with a french-manicure!!! I am from the East coast, I am STILL in disbelief. This was more than a month ago and I can't get the image out of my head of some 6 foot something dude wearing white nail-polish on the tips of his toes. ONLY IN VEGAS! Classic - dude if you read this or if your friends read this and know who you are, you're a legend! And I don't ever compliment other men.
