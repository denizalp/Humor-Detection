I hit some girl opening the door! Not a bad way to meet someone if you ask me;)\n\nExpecting to be in and out in 5 minutes, turns out i got out of there in 30. Which was half an hour before closing time. Met a lot of regulars and some of the workers who were very friendly.\nI have to give the Brisket and Tri-tips a for sure 10. Juicy and tasty, you just cant go wrong. But thats not all, the Ribs(7), Pulled pork(9), and Rib tip(7) were in my to-go box as well. For my sides it was their homemade Baked beans(8) and Macaroni salad(8).\n\nNot only can you eat there, but you can also shop their Butcher shop for some fresh cuts. They pretty much have everything from beef to goat and lamb!
