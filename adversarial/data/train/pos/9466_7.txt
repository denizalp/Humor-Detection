Love the Halloween spirit, food & excellent service by Game & Sabas.  Remarkable!  The sushi bar & whole restaurant was packed so I was surprised that they sat us so quickly on a Sunday night, 10.22.17, 6:30pm.  My first time, guess we got lucky!  We ordered many items & not one was left behind.  \n\nSizzling Ribeye plate over cabbage, side of rice, miso soup & the salad had a tasty ginger dressing & was larger than a usual side dish.  Cooked perfectly & well seasoned  ribeye, sliced.  They offer Teriyaki Chicken, Surf & Turf, Asian Skirt Steak & Sweet & Spicy Pork also.\n\nSalmon Lover Roll, Game's recommendation was fabulous!  Lite lemony mustard cream drizzle over tempura salmon, avocado, cream cheese rolled in rice & topped w\/ fresh salmon!  Delish & I will start w\/ it again!\n\nI'm not a Spicy Tuna Roll fan, but we also ordered the Spicy Tuna Crunch which was fantastic.  Jalape√±o, cream cheese deep fried & topped w\/ spicy mayo & eel sauce so you can't go wrong.  Many rolls have cream cheese btw.  I usually look for the ones that are more fresh so next time will sit at the sushi bar & experiment.  I did love our servers recommendations tho!  \n\nOur Vegan friend got the Cucumber & Avocado roll which was also delish.  Overall, the menu is very appetizing w\/ numerous items that I must come back for & I was happily surprised by everything at Oyshi.  Cheers!
