Great price but I really only liked it because of the yelp deal: $5 of $10 worth of stuff. The prices aren't bad to begin with. ~$5 for a pineapple float, which is pretty large, I'm just not a huge fan. It's super tarty. I think it would have been better a bit more creamy.\n\nThe girls that helped us out seemed a bit confused about the yelp deal. They weren't sure how to ring it up but eventually figured it out. They were nice!\n\nI think I'd be more likely to come back here if it wasn't located inside the food court of the Boulevard mall. I used to love this place as a kid but it has since gone downhill. It's also not as convenient, not being in a standalone spot.
