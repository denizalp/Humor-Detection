Maybe the smallest club in the valley.  That being said...It will have just about everything you need to get a quick work out in.  Remember to bring a work out towel as there is none provided.\n\nI stopped in on a Friday during the lunch time.  The gym was mellow and there was no wait for any sort of equipment.  I thought about deploying the iPod, but the ambient music keep a beat, and this led to a pleasant elliptical experience.\n\nThe gym is clean and the staff was super friendly.\n\nDon't forget to get your parking ticket validated.\n\nThey are closed on Sunday.
