FINALLY! Froyo close to campus (Kent State - Main). Standard procedure; pick a cup, fill it up, weigh, and pay.\n\nThey've got 8 different machines; 16 flavors, plus the option to mix, so a possible 32 flavors for your taste buds to choose from. \n\nAt $0.42\/oz., it's the standard fare (that I've seen in my froyo adventures). \n\nI was impressed by how smooth the operation ran since it had only been open for a few weeks. Nice, friendly staff; clean establishment, and great - albeit bright ;) - environment. Two thumbs up from me!
