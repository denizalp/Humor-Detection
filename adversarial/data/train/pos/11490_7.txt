I was at paymons again last night. I have been going there since I moved here seven years ago, but never wrote a review. I keep coming back for the rich tasting food and the clever ambiance of both the lounge and the patio-like area. Last night I was reminded of the superb service that is seamless and friendly as to be natural and look easy. I am always treated well, and last night Brian the hookah guy and the lovely Julia attended me at the bar. She made me a Bloody Mary with paymons spices and it was just as savory and spicy the way I ordered it, and consistently delicious. Julia and Brian show their professionalism with regal style and efficiency. I also like the Tabouli with quinoa. It is my favorite salad, but the gyro salad is a close second. The curry they have is also a great take on the dish. I am a curry fan and the unique take on the dish keeps me coming back as I cannot find its equal. I will end with saying thank you to Julia again for that amazing Bloody Mary, her continued efficiency, and her beautiful smile. Of course I will just tell her next time I go in.
