Every time i come here my experience is less than satisfying.. I don't know if its the fact that this place is trying to be urban and hip, but instead it's a bunch of overpriced stores and pretentious restaurants. \n\nThe parking -1, I mean what the hell was the person thinking who design this place, parking is confusing and people try run down the back of your ass to get passed you to park.. I mean why are u in such a hurry though? calm all the way down!\n\nThe vibe. -1 . umm there wasn't a vibe to speak of, yeah some people were dinning and out and about walking around but most of the mall seemed dead. \n\nPeople -1 Pretentious.. like let me valet my honda accord so I look super cool kind of pretentious LOL .. \n\nHonestly the only good thing here is the Apple Store, I love the design and the customer service is friendly whenever I've been there. H&M's men section sucks, and The Nike Store is overpriced like SHIT..\n\nyup I will try to avoid coming here in the future.. Fashion Square, hell even Kierland is a better option. MUCH BETTER VIBES\n\n2 LONELY STARS.
