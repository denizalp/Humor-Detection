Went on Sunday 5-29-16 around 6pm.  $41.12 got us two bento boxes, two drinks, a shrimp tempura appetizer, and a tuna sashimi plate. Service was very prompt and friendly.  There is a yelp check-in offer right now of 10% off and I had no trouble redeeming it. \n\nI got the steak and salmon bento for $12.50 and upgraded the rice to fried rice for like $2 more.  The steak was cooked perfectly to medium and the salmon was delicious.  Even the veggies had a great flavor to them.  Next time I would pass on the fried rice though because it was not tasty.  It looked like it was just colored brown with miniscule chunks of chicken in it.  I prefer my fried rice with some veggies in it and I like it to have that nice charred flavor from the wok.  \n\nThis would be a great place to eat if you were watching your girlish figure because the food is lean and healthy but incredibly flavorful.  I'll definitely be back!
