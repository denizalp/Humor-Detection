Half off bottles of wine on Wednesday! They have a pretty decent happy hour- $7-9 for variety of drinks and food. I went with the crab crunch roll and wave roll- both $7 and would order both again, and the hamachi nachi $9- which I would not order again. I wasn't a big fan of the taro chips the fish is served on, and couldn't really identify much flavor. Would be better on a wonton chip. Always consistent service at the bar and a large screen tv that's always playing sports.
