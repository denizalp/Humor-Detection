We stayed at Excalibur and was hungry, so we thought why not try this place out. My hubby and I never been as well as the other couple that was with us.\nService was ok besides all those random offensive comments, which the server told us in advance; it was pretty brutal, we were warned. Haha.\nI asked for water with lemon and I was being serious and didn't even get it. Ugh. :(\nFood wasn't the best, my hubby and I shared nachos with chicken, way over priced and it actually gave me a tummy ache later that night.\nI'm giving 1 star for the servers sense of humor. If you like mediocre food and people talking back at everything you say, this place is for you. \nMaybe you might have a better experience then we did.
