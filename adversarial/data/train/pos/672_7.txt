The return was a litlte less starry, sadly. Definitely some highlights - the salmon ball I was given at the start of the 5 service table d'hote was delicious and I would happily order \"Salmon Balls\" as a main any time they might choose to allow it. The soup aux courge with the fried, breaded cheese ball and bit of crunchy lardon floating at the bottom was perfect, point finale. The Trou Norman palate cleanser (mojito ice) was bangingly boozey and yummy, and I really loved my pain perdu dessert, amazing hot and crispy and dripping with tire a l'erable ice cream. For the main I ordered the bavette, and while I was enjoying the flavour and cut of the meat the anchovy butter melted, got everywhere, and completely overpowered the flavour. It was a cloying bad taste that put me off the rest of the plate and was a shame. \n\nThe server was charming, friendly and sweet but forgot to mention that they were out of the mussels,  or that the bavette was going to come with green beans instead of the kale choux on the menu (the menu is on a chalkboard, why not just update it?) More to the point, they seemed to be under-staffed on the floor and in the kitchen, our meal took 3 hours - too long on a Monday night with only four other tables. This included us asking for our bills with dessert. \n\nI'd try it again, but am not in a rush to go back with so many other tasty places in town to try, and the taste of that anchovy butter still lurking in my mind.
