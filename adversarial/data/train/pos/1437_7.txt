I searched high and low throughout the Carolina Place Mall for this shop and could not find it. I looked at the directory and they're not listed. They have no phone number on their Yelp listing and their web page has no phone number. The URL link points me to a shop in New Jersey.\n\nI fear that Hollywood Heroes & Villains at Carolina Place is gone. If someone spots it, let me know where it is in the mall and I'll update.\n\n[Review 9974 overall, 1554 of 2018.]
