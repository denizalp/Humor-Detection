Was looking forward to Father's Day brunch as Soul Cafe has always been a go to spot for great food.\n\nOur experience started poorly. They had lost our reservation that had been made 3 days prior. Thankfully they had a table to accommodate our group.\nFrom there we were treated to a poorly run debacle which included slow drink refills, food that took over 1:15 minutes to come, incorrect orders and total confusion. \n\nAfter about an hour of waiting one of our group members was told that the dish she had ordered was no longer available. It took an hour for them to figure this out?!? \n\nIt took nearly 20 minutes from the time the first dish came out until we all had our food. There were only 5 of us. When all 5 dishes had come, 3 of the 5 were not what had been ordered.  It also took them that long to get us place settings. Seriously? No napkins and silver wear for almost 1.5 hours after we had been sitting?\n\nUpsides, the servers and manager were super nice about everything. After watching them apologize to nearly every other table for similar issues they were obviously flustered but treated us well. Also, the food was great! Right on par with Soul Cafe which is always excellent.\n\nNeedless to say it will be a long time before I try this place again. Our first try was a very, very crummy experience and I have totally lost faith in this place. I hope they get it together soon because if this keeps up doors will be closed in no time.
