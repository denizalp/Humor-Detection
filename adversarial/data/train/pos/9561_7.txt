I kind of feel like a dick giving this place such an \"low\" rating because out of the two times i've been here, one of them was an absolute blast and the other time i wish i was dead.  \n\nSo, a fair rating would be more like a 2.5\n\nThe Good:  They have the coolest spot on the Washington drag, complete with rooftop patio that is completely urban and when CityScape comes to fruition will be the ultimate place to view it.  \n\nThe Bad:  However, the owners have completely missed what their target rooftop market should be, and \"dumbed\" this place down with awful DJs and a projection screen ... not to mention an completely forced \"VIP room\", which seems more like a holding cell than somewhere to put the local celeb dorks that frequent this place.  \n\nThe Good:  The decor and design.  The interior is very classy\n\nThe Bad:  Their current clientle has completely missed the point.  Tuck in your fucking shirt, or don't, but do it with some fucking style.  You look like shit and you're making this fine bar with some massive potential look like a dive.  \n\nThe Good:  They have a DJ\n\nThe Bad:  He plays bad Hip Hop\/Rap.  I don't mean that i hate Hip Hop.  The exact opposite, actually.  He just plays all the horrible shit.  Would it kill you to update your selection from \"irrelevant\" to \"marginal\"?  How about going beyond that to some indie hip hop like Spank Rock, Handsome Boy Modeling School, M.I.A., or Ohmega Watts?  How about something everyone knows dispersed in there, like Common, Jurassic 5, Lupe, Nas, or OutKast?  The music upstairs is straight up boring.  \n\nThe Good:  You can have a fantastic time here with all of your friends\n\nThe Bad:  You need ALL OF THEM there to make this possible
