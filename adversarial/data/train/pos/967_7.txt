Chimaek!  Gimme that Korean fried chaaacken!\n\nWe got the Type A: Half & Half chicken with Crispy + Yang Nyum (sweet & spicy chicken), Mekomjeyuktukbegibap (hot pot rice with spicy pork), and two Abalone Porridges. We wanted to make sure we get one of each for their namesake --- Po(rridge) Chicken! \n\nThe chicken dish was amazing and was easily shared between four adults with leftovers even. The crispy chicken came with some seasoned salt on the side but was pretty bland overall. I liked the Yang Nyum chicken more as the sauce was sticky and sweet with a little heat. Both chicken styles had huge pieces of chicken so it was exciting despite the wait time. The porridges weren't ground breaking and they didn't offer much variety of banchan for the porridge either. As for the hot pot rice with pork, it was decent. The pork was delicious but I wish the rice ended up crisping up at the bottom.\n\nThe service was so-so. It was pretty busy so our drinks were never refilled and when one of the waitresses turned too sharply with the cart of dirty dishes, the bowls went flying all over and made a mess that ended up getting on our clothes. An apology wasn't even given. Eh! Come for the food but don't expect attentive service. I'll be back for the chicken.
