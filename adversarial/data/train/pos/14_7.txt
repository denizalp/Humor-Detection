Last year, I spent a few days in Taipei and managed to get addicted to bao. Bao are a special sort of steamed bun stuffed with stuff and they're not usually easy to find done right in the US. I did not have high expectations, being halfway around the world, but I knew that I had to give it a try.\n\nChina Go Go does have Bao on the menu and while the bao themselves are quite traditional, being on a plate with french fries and a pot of ketchup seemed odd. I got over it as I ate through this goodness.\n\nI had two, the \"Neighborhood Bird\" which was a flattened and battered chicken breast on a bao with lettuce and tomato and cucumber with a sweet honey mustard sauce. The chicken was excellent, I don't know about the sauce. The \"Original Pork\" was way better. Braised pork with cilantro and peanuts and pickled mustard greens. Very close to what I had in Taipei. Really delicious.\n\nEnjoyed my bao fix and already looking forward to coming back.
