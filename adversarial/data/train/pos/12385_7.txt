Happy 2015! Let's see how many fast food places I can review this year!\n\nThis McDonald's was recently renovated. The new indoor play place is awesome. It's like a three level mini gym for kids complete with obstacles and a slide. There's even a toddler area with interactive musical instruments that are surprisingly loud. My 2 1\/2 year old daughter has a great time playing here and it's a convenient option when the weather is less than perfect to enjoy an outdoor playground or one of the nice parks in the NW. I'm not sure how it compares to other fast food play places but it's the first I've seen of its kind.\n\nThe food? You're not supposed to eat that garbage. Didn't you see Super Size Me? I stopped eating it in the 90s when a Beanie Babie collecting-relative fed me countless Happy Meals because she needed the Teenie Beanie toys that were included at the time. Or was it the time I discovered an unidentifiable blue object in a chicken nugget at a Girl Scouts event and became a vegetarian? Ah, food memories. I did enjoy the white chocolate mocha that was recently discontinued and I have a weakness for the warm strawberries and cream pie. Limited time only!
