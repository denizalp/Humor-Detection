I just love Sam Fox and all of his foodie goodness! True Food Kitchen, the latest to come from Fox Restaurant Concepts and Dr. Andrew Well of the Oprah fame, certainly lives up (and possibly surpasses) the fame of it's sister restaurants. \n\nThe menu consists of all Natural\/ organic foods with a healthy twist. The servers are even wearing \"natural clothes\" that actually look like pajamas! \n\nI ate quick and wish I had time to really dive into the menu, but what I had... I loved! My boyfriend had the Ahi Tuna burger and said \"it was the best ahi burger he has ever had\" (BOLD STATEMENT). I had the Turkey Spaghetti Bolognese, which was amazing! The bolognese had chucks of carrots and other vegetables, and the portion size was perfect. We definitely wanted to try the Sashimi appetizer, that the table next to us said was delicious and fresh. \n\nOverall, the service was excellent- they really were interested in if we enjoyed our experience and had any comments for the new serving team. I loved the menu, it was so different and not outrageously priced. It's clear that a lot of research went in to everything from the decor to the wine selection. \n\nI'm looking forward to getting into the menu a bit more next time!!
