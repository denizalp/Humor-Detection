I love Village Pub. The sister company of Ellis Island, serving the same yummy food as the cafe, but at a more convenient location for us Summerlin folk. This place is tucked away in the quiet Desert Shores Community, if you have never been you probably have to use navigation to get here. \n\nMy family and I have been eating here for over 20 years. My grandma says the first time  she took me here, I was probably 8, I said \"how come there are so many old people here?\" I later learned this place gets a lot of foot traffic from the Sun City crowd. The food is reasonably priced, with daily specials ranging from ribs, to prime rib, to meatloaf. The dinner specials come with a salad (get the caesar, the dressing is homemade and the best I have ever had) and a choice of potato. My mom always gets the lemon chicken which is seriously super good. It's lightly breaded with lots of fresh lemon, capers, and a delicious lemony sauce. They also have breakfast, sandwiches and finger foods.\n\nFYI: This place is also a bar, and smokers are welcome. There is nothing separating the bar from the dining room, so be advised.
