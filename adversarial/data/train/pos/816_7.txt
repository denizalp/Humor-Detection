Great view!!!  Really, seriously.\n\nHostesses greet you and are very helpful.  \n\nDecor is a bit weird....like an old guys expensive condo and trying to be hip? \n\nDidn't eat, but did drink....but when I went to pay my bill with a $50 and got back like $9bucks?   \"Uh honey....2 beers from a $50 isn't $9 in change\".....I think they hired the short blond bartender for reasons other than basic math..if you know what I mean....\n\nThis is the place you want to take a date...have drinks...a nice dinner and enjoy the time....folks here are well mannered and behaved....as it should be in the South *wink*
