I went into the store last night because I am interested in a few model.  It was close to closing time or after closing.  I'm not sure which.  The doors were open so we went inside to check some of the cars out in the show room.  After about 20 minutes someone came up to me and asked. \"Has anyone helped you yet?\"  I said no.  I only had a few questions.  I was gonna be quick.  I currently drive a Prius and have been curious about the TDI models.\nThe sales person seemed not to care at all about my questions.  She seemed like she wanted to go home.  She tried to find out the one question that was the most important to me.  But, I could not get a clear answer.   I currently drive a Prius and am interested in several of the TDI models.\nThe one thing I HATE about going into a car dealership where the staff doesn't know the features of what they are selling or they seem to be \"put off\" by taking up their time.\nSo if I bought a TDI something I would NOT buy it there.\nP.S. There are NO hours of operation posted on the door.  Most dealerships are open until 9.
