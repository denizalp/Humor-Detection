Staying at Ballys wanted some  late night ice cream and Turkish ice cream down in the container stores were open and they're open till like 6am I was told. \n\nI had read that they use some type of tree sap in the tradition Turkish ice cream that prevents it from melting. I tried the three flavors, chocolate hazelnut, Turkish coffee (tasted like any other coffee cream). The pistachio was I believe the only one that has the sap in it, it was kind of gooey texture. It was okay it seem like regular ice cream, it was interesting. \n\nThe chocolate hazelnut was the best flavor to me. Ya it's the strip and it's open late night but the price was a bit high. 2 cups of ice cream with 3 small scoops was $18.00 basically. I don't think I would go there unless I was in some mood to go have late ice cream and that was the only option. \nLike everything on the strip due to real estate the prices are very inflated.\n\nOne more thing the guy working there could have smiled and been a bit more friendlier. I know it was raining and weather was not that great but a smile goes a long way. I think I at least deserve that as a paying customer. Sometimes when the food your eating or buying something is ok what stands out is customer service and just a smile goes a long way in repeat business.
