Hooray!!!! I found another Hawaiian restaurant that I like! \n\nOK. Many moons ago, I lived by an Ono. Many moons later, I moved away, but I would drive past one on my long commute. Then I moved right near my work and no more Ono. So then I see I lived near an L&L. I can once again be happy, right??? WRONG! L&L suuuuuuucccccked. So I just gave up on my Hawaiian food love affair. \n\nFast forward to this evening. I had to quell my craving. So I see what the next nearest place is, and here I land. \n\nThe place was very busy when I came in, but the wait was not long. I'm a big beefy sumbich and I know what I like, and what o like is a BBQ mix with all Mac. Sure as shiitake, they have it! Ordered, sat, and waited. Food took a reasonable amount of time. They brought it to me. \n\nNow I'm a sauce loving mofo, and their teriyaki is the thick kind that I like. They also have katsu. They come in cups, but they are not the lil tiny cups, they are the next size up. Sweet! Got 2 of each. The sauces were great! Not too salty. Sometimes that gets messed up at other places. \n\nThe meats were great and reasonably portioned, based on my experience. The Mac was yummy too! I'm looking forward to coming back soon.\n\nDo be warned, they are busy and they don't have a large dining area. They may not have a place to sit if you come when they are busy.
