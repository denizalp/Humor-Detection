I came in sober and I left drunk. Isn't that what a sports bar is all about?\n\nHonestly I thought this was a great little neighborhood bar. Everything was clean, the service was on point and the drinks were well made. Karaoke started happening sometime during the night which is a great drunken activity. I had a lot of shots. I lot of good shots, mixed shots, yummy shots. Did I mention that I left drunk?\n\nThe only bad part of the evening was the food. Drunk me wants chocolate, and the chocolate they had was in the form of a cold and stale chocolate brownie. Sober me knows better than to order dessert from a sports bar - drunk me is not so smart.\n\nOverall I like Tukee's! I'll definitely be back.
