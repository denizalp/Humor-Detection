I've been into other Papyrus stores before, and I always think of them for high end stationary and cards... so when I popped my head into this location the day before Fathers' Day, I wasn't surprised to see the selection of gorgeous cards, gifts, etc... The display right in front had something for every type of Dad from a gambling dad (mine) to a chill, beachy dad (my husband's) to a handyman dad, an animal loving dad, a sentimental dad, a jokester of a dad, etc... \n\nNeedless to say, I went in with the intention of purchasing a card or two and walked out spending close to $50 fifteen minutes later.  Take that as a warning that this store will suck you in!\n\nThe fellow working was helpful and sweet when I asked him to grab a card for me that I saw in the window display.  He also signed me up for my free membership which scored me a free card that day.\n\nThe only reason that I can't give this store five sexy stars is because it's so darn expensive.  It also has really classy cards of all kinds but I did find it challenging to find a card for the grandpas in our family (whom we call Papa).  I would have liked a bit more selection there. \n\nAll of that being said, I'd absolutely come her for future cards and gifts, especially if I want to wow the recipient!  And on that note, I hope that all of the daddies that get cards from me this year (and all of you daddies out there reading this review) have a very Happy Father's Day today!
