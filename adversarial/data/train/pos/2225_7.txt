Horrible!! Terrible music. The place feels like a high school dance, only with alcohol and more stupidity. I can't believe Town Square tolerates this place. It feels completely out of place from the upscale shopping around it, as does the Saturday night clientele. Please go elsewhere. I also ordered a Moscow Mule, which was the worst I've ever had. It tasted like soda, was served in a water glass, and cost $13. No thank you.
