EZ Mount did a great job mounting two of our TVs and putting in HDMI plates.  We purchased mounts, cables, plates from them for cheaper than we could purchase on our own.  Very clean job, cables completely hidden and not just \"tucked\" away.  Only con we had was the making the initial contact took a little longer than I would have expected given previous reviews.
