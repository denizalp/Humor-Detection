Back for another round at Fabarnak.\n\nMy coworker and I meet up for lunch once a month and sure, we could check out other restaurants in the area, but we just end up going back to Fabarnak again and again.\n\nWe each ordered the Square Peg ($10 - has gone up $1 in price) which on this day contained a slab of roasted piri-piri pork topped with a sunny side egg, creamy coleslaw, fingerling potatoes, and a mini Portugese custard tart. We noticed that the portion size has slightly increased with the price which is fantastic.\n\nFabarnak is celebrating their one year anniversary and also their liquor license.  The beer menu consisted of several choices of bottle local brews priced at $5.00.  They have also expanded their food menu since the last time we visited.\n\nOn my way out, I grabbed a cinnamon cupcake topped with apple cider frosting ($2).  Seriously...does not get better than this.
