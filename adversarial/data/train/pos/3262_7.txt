Whoa!!!! What happened here??!!! \n\nI guess I waited to long to come through on that marriage proposal-the mushroom quesadilla is now completely off the menu. It must have been pissed off when it left because it took quite a few things with it. The delicious mojito is gone too, its been replaced by a horrible sour mess, that was hardly drinkable. It tasted like cheap sour mix from the grocery store with a piece of mint on top We really should have just left after tasting the mojito and finding out that my main squeeze item, the quesadilla, was gone. We should have thought about the time we stopped in for brunch and the chef refused to fry my eggs instead of poaching them. I'm not a poached egg fan, but its never really been an issue as never in my life has a chef refused to fry an egg, the chef did offer to scramble them, but it felt more like a smack in the face than an accommodation, because seriously, if you can scramble an egg why the hell cant you fry it up over easy? That brunch was upsetting but our love of the quesadilla and perhaps the strength of the mojitos made us brush it aside, however, our last meal at Mesa was just so bad and boring and just so really disappointing. The replacement quesadilla made with chorizo and artichoke hearts was pretty bland and by that I mean almost tasteless, as were the formerly magnificent yucatan chicken tacos. It felt like food you might get at a TGI Fridays or Chili's. Having a bad meal is bad enough on its own, paying a ton of money for said bad meal is even worse, but having bad meal that you paid a ton of money for in Las Vegas where really great restaurants abound is just heartbreakingly sad. It is a frustrating waste of money and stomach space that momentarily makes you envious of those lucky anorexics who only need a hair clip and two sturdy fingers to say bye bye to a bad meal. I'm looking forward to my next Vegas trip, but I dont think Mesa grill will be a part of it.
