When you come to Vegas you expect to be stuck on the strip drinking and eating away but when you come with Asian parents, you end up going back to the Chinatown area for some Chinese food cuz they are sick of the American food. This place is pretty far from the main Chinatown Plaza but if you keep driving down Spring Mountain, you will see a 168 Market and there you will find this Yi Mei. The menu is pretty huge with the selection of taiwanese breakfast items ranging from soy milk to radish cakes. The place is popping in the mornings but can be dead at times as well. I'm happy I found the place though because the meal was super super cheap (in comparison to other Vegas food) and it was delicious. We got the soy milk (unsweetened), rice roll, chinese donut, and chicken roll. The soy milk was good.  According to my parents, it was even better than the ones we get in LA. I liked the rice roll the best because i love sticky rice. It was a great combination of sweet from the rice and savory from the chinese donut and the pork sung. The chinese roll is almost like a sausage. It is pretty oily but it is cut up into pieces so you don't have to eat all of it at once but you probably will. I eat it with the chinese donut almost like a mini hot dog (just remember to try to squeeze out some of the oil from the chinese donut. The service is quick and efficient. The lady that works there seems to know everyone or at least makes it seem like she's your bed bud. There are a ton of other things on the menu. It is kind of like a hole in the wall so remember to clean the table before you start munching. It's quick and simple but satisfying and I have to admit, it's a good break from all of the buffets and benedicts on the strip.\n\nFYI, they also sell vacuum packed items from Champion company which is known for their pork sung and other marinated items.
