Called in to inquire about an a mailer sent to my home about a HELOC. The lady I spoke with was incompetent and steered around answering my question. My level of knowledge is very high in this area and she tried talking to me as though I can be easily steered away from asking technical questions and to think she knows what she's talking about. Nice try, but it didn't work. She also kept huffing and puffing which was very rude. I asked to speak to a supervisor and apparently they don't have one.
