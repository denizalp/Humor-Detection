A co-worker mentioned this place awhile ago and thank goodness, I finally got a chance to go.\n\nI have to admit, discovering this place, tucked into a non-descript food court off McCaul and across OCAD was like finding buried treasure. Who knew this was here? Okay, maybe OCAD students.\n\nIn the past,  I have walked down this street so many times but never noticed this was here. If I hadn't been following instructions from my little blue dot on my iphone. (Yeah, that's right) I think I still would have missed it.\n\nIt's a modern eatery surrounded by a world of familiar cheap eat booths from every corner of the globe. Upon entering their space, you are immediately welcomed in Japanese. After reading the menu and reviews, I ordered the shigure don. A bowl of white rice topped with thin slices of beef and onion in a special sauce I like to call yum. \n\nThe low down: a variety of noodle and rice dishes as well as desserts.  Priced between $2-$7 per item.  They are licensed so you can get your drink  on with Japanese alcohol and sake. Seating is available for individuals and groups. \n\nService is extremely fast and friendly. Clean! Price is inexpensive. Washroom is on the ground floor (they get a star just for that!)
