Excellent jerk prawns.  The seasoning was perfect, and while they were spicy, they weren't so spicy I couldn't enjoy the meal.  The sides the prawns were served with were good as well (coleslaw, grilled corn, breadstick).  The beverages they offer here are wonderful as well.  While I was initially wary of getting carrot juice, the carrot juice they offer here is slightly sweet (from the addition of raw sugar), creamy, and the nutmeg they added gave it a very nice flavor.  The Pink Ting grapefruit soda is also quite tasty, as well as the refreshing apple cider (locally produced).  \n\nDuring our meal the waiters strongly suggested that we order the beans and rice with the jerk entrees.  I tasted some of the rice and beans from my husband's entree (brown stew chicken), which tasted OK, nothing special.  If it is so strongly suggested to add the beans and rice to the entree, why isn't it included automatically in the entree then?\n\nMinus some points for naming your restaurant breadfruit, but not having breadfruit on the menu!  It's like calling your restaurant Kentucky Fried Chicken but not offering any chicken. : p
