It's sad to say that the quality of this hotel has drastically decreased. I stayed here with a group for the 3rd time during the magic trade expo (we like to stay here because of the cleanliness, spacious rooms, and ease of traveling to\/from the expo). We had a 5 rooms for 4 nights, plus 2 additional rooms for 2 nights. Needless to say, every room had at least one issue...\n\n1. Room had dirty room service dishes upon arrival.\n2. Room had dust all over the wood floors.\n3. (My) room, coffee cups and glassware I used was never replaced, only removed by housekeeping.\n4. Room was too small for husband, wife n daughter (12y) had requested room with 2 beds. Couldn't be changed after check in.\n5. Used toiletries were not replaced by housekeeping.\n\nUpon complaining to the front desk (night shift, we were at the expo all day) they managed to wave some of our resort fees, but still didn't feel accommodating as we were not utilizing any of the benefits included in the resort fees. \n\nAll in all, we were disappointed as a group and will not be returning for the next expo.
