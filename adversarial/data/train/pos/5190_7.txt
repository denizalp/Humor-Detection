DeNora's Ristorante is a small Italian Restaurant with a bar and a patio. They offer Italian style dinners, a ravioli of the day and an assortment of pizzas.\n\nI think the sweet spot here are the pizzas........because those garlic knots we tried were absolutely delicious and I noticed other customer's pizza that truly looked amazing.....\n\nWhat drew me here was the dinner menu. They offered some Italian Dishes you just don't find at most Italian restaurants. In short the dinners we tried did not meet our expectations. I note nothing was horrible but really both dinners weren't served as described. I note I was also wrong not to tell the owner about my dinner but I didn't feel like complaining after my husband complained about his dinner. AGAIN nothing was horrible but both dinners weren't prepared as they should be.\n\nThe owner seemed very nice and also was understanding. She even took my husband's dinner off the bill when we asked her not to.\n\nI think the sweet spot here are the pizzas.\n\n I must rate this restaurant at three stars because I have some reservations. Three stars means A-OK in Yelp and nothing is bad about a positive A-OK....
