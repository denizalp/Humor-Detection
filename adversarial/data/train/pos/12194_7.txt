I was killing time in Parkdale (waiting for a table at Grand Electric, of course) when I spotted the pinball machine in a window across the street. Stepping in to Community 54 I found the makings of an old school arcade. There was Street Fighter pinball, Galaga, NBA Jam and others. Suddenly waiting for table didn't seem so bad.\n\nBut this isn't really an arcade. It's a retail shop that houses a healthy mix of new and vintage clothing, hats and accessories. Everything here is reminiscent of that liminal space between the 80s and 90s. Neon, hiphop, record-scratchy. \n\nActually it's more than a retail shop; it's a man cave. The fashions are casual and fun, and the guys working here are more than OK with it if you just chill out and pump quarters into Terminator 2. Dudesque touches about. A large Canadian flag hangs from the ceiling and unfurls into a makeshift changeroom. There is a boombox on the floor. Kewl place.\n\nObligatory Title Pun: LIV it up at 54! \n\nMenu Readability: Their understated signage is more befitting a Detroit barbershop than a hipster curio emporium; I suppose that is the point.\n\nNeed to mention: I think they throw events here from time to time.\n\nWhat this place teaches me about myself: \"If you don't learn Roman numerals, you won't know the year certain motion pictures are copyrighted!\"
