I found this wonderful company at a local Home Show and hired them to remodel my bathroom and my kitchen. I cannot express in words how happy I am with my bathroom and kitchen. Snail shower with custom glass in the bathroom, a beautiful vanity with quartz countertops, mirrors, lights and tile. Amazing cabinets with ALL the upgrades in my kitchen, and beautiful countertops and backsplash. They gave me a price on the spot with discount, brought all the materials out to my house to choose, so I didn't have to run around and find what I wanted. From installation, to project management, to keeping with their schedule; they get an A++++. I can't wait to recommend them to my friends, and I will most definitely be using them on any more projects in my house. Do yourself a favor and HIRE THIS COMPANY!!
