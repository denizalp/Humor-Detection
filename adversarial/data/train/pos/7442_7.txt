This review is for the hotel and rooms only:\n\nMy favorite hotel to stay at.  Rooms are super spacious and plush.  As much as I love modern rooms. They can feel cold and small. These rooms are warm and relaxing. It's nice having the step down area with a large couch and separate TV. There's also a Tv in the bathroom which is nice as your getting ready. \n\nGreat location and easy to get around with lots of restaurants to pick from.  It's nice that CVS is around the corner as well.
