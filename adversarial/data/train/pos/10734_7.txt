Beautiful library. Exceedingly useful. Tables are always open and clean, the lighting is fantastic, the chairs are comfortable. The air is always cool and not stale, which is nice. The few employees I've talked to were friendly. \n\nI like signing the ballot proposal sheets out front. Those aren't a scam. Despite digital everything, those sheets are how propositions get on our voting ballots.
