My god, why does a hot dog taste so good?  That was rhetoric, but if you want to answer I'm all ears and will probably agree with you, whatever you say.  \n\nYovi's appeared on my radar a long time ago.  So I have had my eye on the prize for a good amount of time.  It didn't take much convincing of my other half to come here, it was a to be a quick lunch for us before I had to head to work for the day.  And to agree on something in Market Square is hard to come by on short notice.\n\nI like the feel of this place.  It is kind of rustic and feels like it was suppose to be that way.  I like the downstairs feel you get from it and really feel it adds to the character of eateries in Market Square.\n\nWe came here for a quick lunch one day.  It was after the lunch rush so that made for quick service.  My better half is from Chicago originally and when I told him exactly what Yovi's was, he was excited to come here.  Especially since they specialize in Chicago style dogs.  We go up to the counter area and place our order.  He gets two Chicago style dogs and I get two chili cheese dogs.  He downed his in no time flat, I took a little bit longer to enjoy mine.\n\nThe dogs are nice and fresh, served on poppy seed buns.  The chili and cheese on mine blended well and gave a little kick to mine.  I had also added diced onions which gave a little crunchiness to it as well.\n\nWhen we finished and right before we walked out we talked to the guy working.  Turns out he is the owner and very proud of what he does.  The owner himself is from Chicago as well.  What better business to have here than something to remind you of home.  My better half and him strike up a conversation and we find out that when the Chicago Cubs come to town to play the Pirates, they do a pretty awesome thing.  But you have to basically be in the know for it.  I don't want to give it away in the review, in fact I implore you to go here yourself to find out.  It's quite a good deal is all I got to say.
