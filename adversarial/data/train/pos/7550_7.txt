I came to Vosier upon a friend's recommendation.  Sadly it's not worth the drive to Pickering.\n\nI had a timing belt changed, and was advised that it would be better to drop off the night before so they could start work promptly in the morning.  It turns out they didn't start until afternoon, and I didn't get my car back until nearly 10pm at night.  So that part of the experience could have been improved.  \n\nThe saga continues, when a few weeks later, with very little driving my car dies.  I called them for help, and received a weak \"maybe I'll come look at it\".  To which I couldn't make decisions on car repair based on a \"maybe\".  I had the car taken elsewhere for an opinion.  The \"turbo\" on my engine \"grenaded\" - yes, \"grenaded\".  I called them back to see if they wanted to have a look at the car, and was greeted with yet another \"maybe\".  They finally went to look at the car, that was parked at the dealer, and emailed me that it might be because of low oil pressure.  But the oil had just been changed, and there was no evidence to support oil leakage.  Needless to say, that I have thousands of dollars of damage to my engine, that may not have been caused by Vosier.  Not only did they not provide any insight or quote on the work, trying to work with them ultimately delayed my decision making process, leaving me car-less and taking the better way for a couple of days.\n\nBut I'm looking for a mechanic to provide solutions to my problems, not point fingers at others.  Incidently I had my car fully serviced (all fluids checked and topped up the week before they serviced my vehicle).  I shouldn't have to coax a quote outta someone.\n\nSo I would give them only one star, based on lack of professionalism.  IMHO, and it's just not worth the drive to Pickering.  Can't put all the blame on them, I should have gone somewhere else to avoid all hassle.
