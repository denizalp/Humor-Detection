*** UPDATE ***\n2\/16\/11\n\nBoth the beef brisket and smoked chicken offered at the butcher's counter are fantastic - tender, juicy, and thoroughly WOW!  I wish they'd cook more than one brisket a day, though. Some days they run out early!\n\n________________________________________________\n\nWhole Foods\nWhole Foods\nYou're a tasty place.\nLove your meats,\nYour produce too,\nThey all go in my face.\n\nYour cheese selection \nRocks my world,\nYour food bar is sublime.\nI know you cost more than the rest,\nBut you're worth it ... \nEvery dime!\n\nFor quality groceries and excellent customer service, there is no other contender for my grocery dollar.  WF is the only place where I can find Coconut Milk Creamer ($2.79), and they have the best lemons in town (at about $1 ea.). Since I consume mass quantities of both, I shop here at least twice a month.\n\nGranted, prices are high, but I would rather skimp in other areas of my budget, and get the best food I can for my body's sake.\n\nService wise, I was impressed on a recent visit, when I actually found a store employee who was friendly AND willing to check in the back for something I was seeking. I cannot remember the last time I was able to find a clerk to assist me at one of the major chain markets! \n\nI love you, Whole Foods!
