I hate Las Vegas healthcare. Its one of the worst in the country.\n\nI changed insurance so I had to change doctors, and since I now live in Henderson decided to check here. My first 5 choices were all booked until November. Finally this office and Dr. Meli had an opening in late August so I booked it.\n\nMy first appointment was at 9:15am and went smoothly....on time, no issues. My followup is where it goes all wrong. Scheduled for 11:15am, I don't get called in until 12:45pm, then sit there until 1:30pm when someone takes my pulse and blood pressure. 35 minutes later the doctor comes in and goes over my test results. I'm mostly curious about my PSA score since I know the cancer is back. No PSA score on the tests. This was the primary reason for scheduling the appointment, and was told to the person who took my blood and confirmed. Doctor leaves, I check paperwork and sure enough....there's the PSA score on the bottom of the last page. \n\nMy recommendation is to avoid this place and this doctor. Where you go...well....good luck with that as well. I recommend Mexico or Thailand or somewhere with good medical care.
