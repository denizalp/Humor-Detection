So not really Italian....and soooo overpriced and the atmosphere is almost non-existent....parking is horrible....using a voucher from Restaurant.com takes a bit of the bite of how not wonderful this place is.  The owner circulate among the guests but only talk to their croonies.\n\nI live in Henderson NV where this restaurant is.
