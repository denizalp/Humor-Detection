We are from out of town and heard this place had good pizza. I decided to call and order a pizza, so asked about what kind of sizes, type of crust and if they do white pizza. The guy told me he only had pizza crust and red sauce and since I was asking for a different type of pizza, that this wasn't the right pizza place for me. He told me I wouldn't want to order from them and hung up the phone. Not sure if it was because if my Hispanic accent or what but he was extremely rude and didn't even give me a chance to order or ask. I would have been perfectly fine with a red sauce, regular pizza crust with cheese and pepperoni but he wouldn't even take my order. I was just trying to ask. Rude. Very!
