Having been to other locations, I wanted to check out the semi-new location in Yorkville.\n\nThe service was horrendous! \nI ordered a chicken shwarma wrap and it took over 45 mins to arrive, while my friend's order arrived within 15 mins. It was lunch time but the timing was too long for a sandwich. \n\nI had asked my waitress to inquire about my order several times with the same response that the staff was making it.\n\nThankfully the wrap was tasty, as the chicken wasn't dry with lots of sauce. \n\nThe food was pretty standard to other Paramount restaurants but the long lunch wait was not worth it.
