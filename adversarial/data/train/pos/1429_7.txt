It's so so good! \n\nHash house should hand out yoga pants at the door. A host should greet you and say, \"Hi, welcome, our food is delicious and served in ridiculous portions so here are some stretchy pants to help you feel better about eating until you hate yourself!\" \n\nWe ordered the man vs. food Benedict, the roasted chicken and red pepper skillet, the salmon sandwich and the artichoke, sun dried tomato hash. All of which were pure deliciousness! The Benedict... Unreal. It has mashed potatoes, cheese, eggs, fried chicken, a biscuit and it's smothered in a sauce you could bathe in. The strawberry jam that's served with the biscuits tastes so fresh and real. Not smuckers jam, real grandma made it type jam. \n\nOur service was pretty good but the it took almost 15 minutes to get our bill. The only negative thing I can say about the good is that the salmon sandwich needs a different bun, it's too much bread to sandwich ratio. \n\nWe will be back, with out stretchy pants on!
