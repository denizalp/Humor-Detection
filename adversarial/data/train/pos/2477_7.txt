Alright, Burgatory\/BRGR\/every other trendy gourmet burger establishment that has popped up in Pittsburgh within the past year--it's time to start trying harder. Or maybe, stop trying, because it might be impossible to reach the level of delicious that is Winghart's.\n\nMaybe I'm exaggerating...am I? The burger I had here was most definitely in the top five burgers ever eaten in my life, and THE best in Pittsburgh, though to be fair I'm semi-new to the area and have yet to try Tessaro's. I had the Shipwreck burger: Bacon. Brie. Carmelized Onions. Arugula. Truffle Aioli. TRUFFLE AIOLI--I didn't care what else was on the burger, if I hear \"truffles,\" I'm there. Even though I don't generally like onions, I decided on this rare occassion I would trust Mr. Shipwreck and just order it as-is instead of my usual laundry list of additions and omissions.\n\nOf course I was excited, but I was also a bit nervous. Every one of the toppings has an intense flavor that can easily overpower. But by some miracle, it not only worked, it was perfection, with a complexity that you just have to eat to understand. The burger itself was not quite as red as I prefer, but it was so juicy that it actually didn't matter. Oh, and it's about twice the size of BRGR's pathetically portioned patty. I'm totally in love.\n\nNegatives:\n\n1. Location. I don't go downtown unless I absolutely have to because of obvious transportational issues. Plus, it's not exactly the most happenin' neigborhood in town. UPDATE: Problem solved, there's now a second location on the Southside!\n\n2. The signage. Ed Hardy called, and he wants his logo back. But hey, it's marginally better than BRGR's (no excuse for using Papyrus on anything other than the title page for a 9th grade essay on Ancient Egypt). So, keep rockin' it out Winghart's...that awkward heart tattoo won't stop me from enjoying your obscenely good burgers!
