Terrible Meal!!!! Me And My Girl Had The Huaraches. Traditional Mexican Confort Food. First Off The Huarache Is Supposed To Be Fried, It Wasn't. Second The Meat Is Supposed To Be Suculently Delicious It Wasn't, For The Amount Of Time It Took To Cook, It Should Have. Third Is You Have To Pay Per Drink. The Drinks They Have For Sale Are Not Very Big What Ever They May Be, Water, Soda Or Haguas Frescas Like The Horchata. Fourth Service Was Mediocre And Last We Got Overcharged Even With The 20% Discount This App Offers. NEVER GOING BACK!!!!!
