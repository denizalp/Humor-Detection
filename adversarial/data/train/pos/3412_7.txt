I don't get it. Is having reclining seats that big of a deal? Okay so picking out your seats before the movie is pretty convenient. No more fighting in line and stampeding in the theater for your favorite spot! Another obvious plus? No one can kick you in the back of the seat during the movie. I hate shit-stains who kick the backs of seats during a movie. Also, there's a swingy table thing that makes eating at the theater so much easier. Other than those features, I still prefer plain ol' run of the mill theaters.\n\nWhy you ask? In my opinion, those luxury seats are uncomfortable! Like really uncomfortable. My back hurts when I leave the theater. Plus, since it's (faux?) leather, the seats are sticky and I feel gross if my bare skin touches the seats. Can you imagine watching a movie during the summer? Sticky central! \n\nIf you sit towards the back rows, the ledge obstructs your view of the screen. My husband and I learned real quick that the best seats are the middle to lower sections of the theater.  \n\nThe Galaxy Cannery theater has temperature issues, too. It's always scorching in here. Maybe I'm just used to cold air-conditioned theaters? \n\nThis is the only \"luxury\" theater I've visited. I guess they're not my thing!\n\nYELP 100 CHALLENGE 2015: #14
