This is a BREASTaurant    - Hooters with a mountain theme.  I already know this will be a sausage (venison?) fest with exclusively miserable husbands at the bar escaping with sports.\n\nOk this is where they started and went downhill from there.  1 - no gaming - good luck in Vegas franchise from Texas!  2 - young pups (hired for hair and implants and are exactly 21) who don't know how to pour a Manhattan or hold a crowd (lots if standing around and pouting).  3- supposed to be sexy but exactly one skinny body type - no bum no body diversity.  4.  Food sucked and was $$!   Beer slushies and wings on par with Denny's - yum yum. \n\nThis place has been 4 different concepts and this will die out soon too.  There is nothing at all interesting with food, beer, or girls.  The girls are sweet but this is a hot mess of trying to be sexy when we see more on billboards here!  Alienating 50 percent of the population with SIT2P bathrooms and terrible service to females as evidenced by many Yelp reviews in other cities -- not smart! \n\nOk I got accused of being jealous by a fellow Yelper.  Not true- there are lots of places with sexy gals that I love (PT's Gold, Treasures ;) but you also need to be a good bartender!  If you don't know where Firestone beer is from or where you get the venison in the chili from you are just eye candy.  There is nothing wrong with being sexy but if this is a dining spot and not a strip club then act like it!!  Food and service was worse than Hooters - I didn't know that was possible.  You don't really come to a place like this for anything but the girls. Unimpressed.  Grapes on a celery.  No curves :(\n\nArkansas Times agrees with me.  Epic bad.\n\nThey called it, \"The worst most apathetic swill I've ever eaten.\"  Ha ha ha yep!
