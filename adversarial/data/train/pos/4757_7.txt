It kind of sucks when you visit home, and you find out your parents' new car was scratched going through a car wash.  It's worse when you find out the car wash didn't own up to the problem.  It's even worse when you know how much it would cost to fix the scratches.\n\nThen you find out that when your parents stopped buying gas from this place, the engine performance of their other car (which is still quite young) improved.\n\nBetween wash scratches and dirty fuel pumps, I would stay away from this place.
