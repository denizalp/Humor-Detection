If you've visited The Rubber City, or stayed with friends, or lived there, or were born with tire treads instead of finger prints, you know about Swenson's, and you know about Skyway.  There are only two possibilities, for your drive-in burger, fry, onion ring and shake addiction, and, usually by birth, you already know where you stand.\n\n\"Dad, could we go to...\"  It was either Swenson's.   OR...  it was Skyway.  Nobody, and I really do mean nobody, said, \"Hey, instead of Skyway, let's give Swenson's a try tonight, huh?\"  You would be drawn, quartered, and forced to sing the Michigan fight song, while slathered in Aqua-Velva and left to fend for yourself at a picnic table outside a Lawson's store.\n\nSo, I was born into a Skyway family.  That was it, you didn't have a choice.  \n\nThen, that Galley Boy popped up out of the alley, whispering, \"Here.  Taste this...  the first one's free...  come on.  TRUST me...\"\n\nIt was all over.  The hook was set, the line tightened, and the only thing left was the carhop reeling me in, ready for my weekly Galley Boy, bowl of chili, tall cola.  Damn.  I just ate there about four hours ago, and if not for the snow, I'd drive right back there now.\n\n(I nearly took a star off for the unbelieveably feng-shui-challenged location of this place.  It looks like they lost the lottery when the retail space was doled out in the Great Montrose Money-Sucking Strip Mall Megachurch From Hell.  They at least have a few pine trees in the parking lot, but it is pretty damned awful.  I don't think that's really Swenson's fault, so I left all five stars.)\n\n(I had to update this review:  Wax bags.  They hand you your \"to-go\" food in WAXED bags.  How perfect is that, on a scale of one to PERFECT?  When was the last time anyone handed you food in waxed paper?  Were you listening to the latest hit from Frankie and Annette?  Were you helping your Dad dig the Cold War bunker?  Dig that waxed bag.  That's just so, so... SwenSATIONal.)
