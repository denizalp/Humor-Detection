Gotta admit - when I first heard of a sushi burrito I was confused. I love sushi and I love burritos, but the two of them put together just made me feel uncomfortable LOL. Regardless, my girlfriend has been wanting to try one and so we came here for her birthday lunch. It was so good that I was craving another one the next day. When we got there the place was pretty packed - we were lucky to find a table. My girlfriend got the special on rice paper, I got the Fire Cracker on seaweed, along with two beers each (happy hour all day - beers only $3!). I recommend this place to anyone that likes sushi (read: all of mankind).
