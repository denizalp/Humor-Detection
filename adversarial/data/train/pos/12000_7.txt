Tiny little, clean place.....3 tables of 4.\n2 tables of 2 and a counter with 6 seats.\nCabbage & noodles were tasty. Wish there was some bacon or some meat in it though. Stuffed cabbage was some of the best I've ever had. Potatoes were dry and ice cream scoop shaped. Canned green beans. My Dad reports the perch dinner was the best he's had in a long time!! Kudos on that. Food was tasty. Seemed a lil pricey but hey it was worth it!!! I'll totally be back
