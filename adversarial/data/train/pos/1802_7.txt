Yummy food ! I\nHowever, I wouldn't recommend the house broth if you are not used to Asian hot pot because it has too much \"seeds\" (I forgot the name) in it. When you bite into it, it somewhat numbs your mouth and then there is a hint of a metal flavor. \n\nIf you are a first timer I would recommend either the mushroom or tomato broth! Their presentation is beautiful especially with the combos. They have cute little baskets and use dry ice as decoration as well. \n\nWe had the meat combo, scallops, 2 mushroom soup, pork dumplings, rice (you have to order), crab meat, and veggie noodles. It came out to about $50 enough for 2 people. Everything was very tasty however you have to watch the noodles carefully because they tend to get pretty mushy if you leave it in too long. \n\nI LOVE the sauce station ! They have a wide variety of sauces to choose from and to mix with. It was also a nice touch how they had sauce mixture recommendations. \n\nThey also have a happy hour for everything on the conveyor belt buy one get one free SUN-THURS 9:30-12:30. \n\nOverall, I had a wonderful experience. Shout out to our server xiao xiao! She was very helpful with refilling our broth and with anything that we needed.
