Honestly I'm not much of a donut lover so it's not often that I find a donut that makes my toes curl. Plus, I used to live in Portland Oregon which is home to one of the most creative a nummy donut shops on earth, well until I found Pink Box! Thanks to my great friend, who is a Vegas native and lives in Henderson, that came to visit me one day. She looked up my address and saw that I live just a block away from Pink Box and she absolutely had to stop in, and was I glad she did!!! I have driven by the donut shop almost daily for over a year and never woulda thought they had \"out of the box\" donuts. My friend came with 2 dozen of the oddest variety... Banana Cream Pie, Maple and BACON, the Fat Elvis, lol and more! Let's just say that these days we are frequent visitors and will be long time patrons!
