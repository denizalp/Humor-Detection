My friend Greg and I used to have this thing called \"The Greg and Kate special\" which meant that we'd walk to Greenbush at whatever hour of the night when doughnuts were the only thing to satisfy our hunger (they're open really late on weekends, I think at least 2 a.m.) and each get three, yes, three doughnuts and a pint of milk.  (Really putting my fast metabolism to work).  This was always one of the happiest moments of the weekends.  Greenbush doughnuts just make you happy.  They always taste fresh outta the oven, they have a million varieties (cake and raised along with cinnamon rolls and other kinds of pastries), AND they're kosher.  What more do you need?
