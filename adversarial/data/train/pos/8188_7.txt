**WEEKDAY BRUNCH $22**\n\nMy new favorite buffet on the Strip! I was so impressed by the creativity of the food as well as the flavors. I loved that many of the dishes were small plated creations instead of just a big vat of orange chicken for you to scoop. Here are some highlights:\n\n-- free mimosa, bloody mary, or champagne. I enjoyed the mimosa; refreshing, just enough booze.\n-- short rib eggs benedict is AWESOME. I must say that I make a pretty mean eggs benedict, and I have never been impressed with a buffet's version until now. Savory, cooked perfectly.\n-- sweet potato and pork hash is tasty with a nice kick.\n-- angry mac and cheese is fantastically creamy with a hint of tabasco on the finish.\n-- asiago-stuffed gnocchi is hearty but the real star of the dish is the brussels sprouts. Cheesy and SO YUMMY.\n-- butternut squash ravioli in brown butter with pumpernickel croutons is fabulous with great layering of flavors.\n-- fried rice with Chinese sausage: homey and delicious.\n-- gelato: pistachio and raspberry are both outstanding.\n-- strawberry shortcake: one of those layered desserts in a little clear cup. Beautiful presentation. Strawberry meringue on top adds a nice crunch but not too much. Super delicious; I wanted to eat three.\n\nDefinitely a winner! Didn't break the bank and there was no line at 11am on Tuesday. Will definitely be back.
