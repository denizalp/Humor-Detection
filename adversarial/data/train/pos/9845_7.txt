This have always been my go to theater! I used to get annoyed by the awful smell. I swear we have farmers who loves to come here. Because that what it smell like in the theater! Soil with cow craps! But I dealt with it. Recently I noticed it gotten so much better.. I love how you can go before 4pm and it's only $5! Such a deal! Since Sundays during football OFF season is the perfect time for me to go watch a movie. They alway mange to keep it clean. The popcorn\/concession stand alway have been stock. Some cheery staffs, some could be better. But I promise you. The staffs that sells the tixs.. I really don't think they like their jobs much. They look sooo annoyed all the time! So I tired to buy my tixs in advance as much as I can to avoid that!
