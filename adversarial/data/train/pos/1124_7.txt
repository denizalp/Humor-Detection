This is the worst hospital. I went in with chest pain 9 out of 10 and they said we can't give you anything to mask the pain. Some tall baldheaded Doctor came in and talked down to me  They r so full of shit. You go to any hospital and they will give you morphine. It's a hospital that what they do help control your pain. This place sucks!!!!!!! I left the hospital.
