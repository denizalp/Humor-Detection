3\/19\/11\n\nAfter checking out the scene at Degree 270, my friend and I decided to end the evening w\/ something sweet at Black Fig Bistro.  We both like chocolate and peanuts, and I'd had the opportunity to try the peanut butter and chocolate tart here a few times before, so I suggested we order this.  My friend LOVED this dessert! http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/black-fig-bistro-scottsdale?select=S_oi-WhT5tat37ZKq79YjA#S_oi-WhT5tat37ZKq79YjA  We practically inhaled it, taking fast turns at the plate!  :)  I was already satisfied w\/ my half of the pastry... or was it she w\/ hers?  :P  In any case, we decided we'd try another-- a yellow cake w\/ chocolate ganache and finished w\/ chocolate and white chocolate curls.  Sounds good, doesn't it?  Well, it looked better than it tasted. http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/black-fig-bistro-scottsdale?select=JjytWa_ggHvFBwRJk3TfOg#JjytWa_ggHvFBwRJk3TfOg  The cake was very dry, and the frosting wasn't as creamy, nor rich as we both wanted it to be.  The cute curlicues of chocolate weren't enough to save this pastry--  they tasted old, as if they've been in the fridge for too long.  \n\nI'd check out the other desserts, but not very late in the day!
