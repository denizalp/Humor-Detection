I've walked through this place a few times, eyeing all of their delicacies. And yesterday was the day I finally broke down and purchased some! We'd already had quite a large dinner and dessert, so I simply chose one macaron and one truffle. \n\nThe Orange Chocolate Truffle - orange macaron with a dark chocolate center. The macaron was so moist and soft of the inside - just the light consistency you want! Not to mention it's beautiful flavor. \n\nThe PB&J Truffle - PB ganache with a dallop of raspberry jam, enrobed in chocolate. The PB ganache was smooth in texture and mild in flavor. It was the chewy jelly that had zing and pulled the whole piece together. \n\nWhat a fun little visit. Check them out!
