Calling all Kinder Queers!\n\n\nDon't get me wrong. I love the gays and I love nightclubs, but Krave, oh Krave let me count the ways you disappoint me.\n\n1. 18 and older. What the? Yes, this place is an old man's paradise. The keep the \"underagers\" up front, away from the bar, and put a big black X on their wrists. If you get caught giving booze to the youngins, you're 86ed.\n\n2. For being an \"alternative\" nightclub on the strip, you'd think this club would be on par with the other nice posh clubs. This place is broke down and needs a renovation stat!\n\n3. The space is not laid out well. There's really not a lot of rhyme and reason to the layout.\n\n4. There is only one bar and it's waaaay in the back. Come on now. You'll make more bang for your buck with a little mini bar.\n\n5. There is a cover charge for locals after midnight. LAME! Locals should never have to pay, ever. Cover charges are only sensible when there is a live, quality entertainment.\n\nThis is my major beef with this place. There are some redeeming qualities...\n\nOccasionally, my favorite queens from RuPaul Drag Race perform here. There are great, great drink specials and it's pretty easy to get a comped bottle.\n\nI think if this place elimnates it's 18+ thing and gets some work done, it would be an okay place, but it's kind of a shit storm.
