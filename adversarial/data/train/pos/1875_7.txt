Excellent Latin street food. Is it authentic? I really don't care. Is it tasty and delicious? That I care about and it absolutely is.\n\nI went with three tacos - one chicken, one carne asada and the third al pastor. They took a few minutes to be prepared and then it was time to dig in. Nice \"autenticos\" plating with chopped onions and chopped cilantro. Everything tasted super fresh. The beef was nice and rich tasting, the pork and chicken had a nice roasted flavor.\n\nBe really careful with the salsa bar. It goes from very warm at the left to insane at the right. I am not kidding.
