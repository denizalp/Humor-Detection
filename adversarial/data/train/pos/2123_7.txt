I heard about this place from friends- it's not an area I usually venture out to, but I was intrigued by the idea of Thai street food in Vegas. Unfortunately, aside from the wraps, they have a pretty standard menu.\n\nTHAI CHICKEN WINGS: Good flavor in the sauce but otherwise a bit on the dry side, price was okay for the portion but this didn't stand out as something I'd get again.\nCRYING TIGER WRAP: grilled sliced beef, lettuce, tomato, onion, mint, cilantro, and rice wrapped in a tortilla with a spicy lime sauce. I really enjoyed the sauce and the tender meat, but there was no rice in my wrap. It was mostly stuffed with lettuce, which made it lighter than the burrito-esque food I was expecting.\n\nStaff was friendly when I went to pick up my order. They did inform me that the curries were popular, and they were likely removing the wraps from the menu. Despite the seedy area, the interior was nicely decorated with dark wood and large color photos of Thailand street markets. Disappointed that they don't actually have anything resembling street food here.\n\nNOTE: Pricing is a little high for the area, such as $10 for an entr√©e without rice (additional $3) and all apps seem to be about $8. Not super high or anything, just not consistent with expectations for Industrial Rd.
