BLT is located at the Mirage, near Sportsbook.\n\nMY BOYFRIEND TO THE WAITRESS: \"I'LL HAVE THE NUT JOB.\"\n\nGit your dirty minds outta the gutter!!!!!  It's not what you think!!!!  ;) \n\nBLT Burger may seem like your typical burgers, fries, and milkshake spot buuuuuut it really isn't. Their burgers and shakes are pretty fancy schmancy (yet reasonably priced) with different variations offered depending on the ingredients used.  Seating is a plenty and there's even a bar where you can watch either the multiple TVs OR you can watch the cooks cook and build your burger.\n\nMy favorite 'burger' here is the Salmon ($14) consisting of Atlantic Salmon, Avocado, Red Onion, Watercress, and Zesty-Cayenne Tartar Sauce. Mine and my boyfriend's favorite milkshake here is The Nut Job ($7), hence my boyfriend asking the waitress for a Nut Job! It's made with Vanilla Ice Cream, Nutella, and Slivered Almonds. OMG, it's all yummy goodness!\n\nDuring our weekend stay in Vegas we ate here 3 times!!!  I ordered a different burger each time, but aside from the Salmon I can't remember the other ones I had (must've not made that much of an impression on me).  As for the fries, the burgers do not come with fries so me and my boyfriend shared, which was good since the burgers are pretty hefty.  Out of the skinny, fat, and waffle fries I preferred the waffle fries. \n\nNeedless to say, I was strung out on burgers and fries after our 3rd time here, but we still couldn't get enough of the Nut Job. Before leaving Vegas my boyfriend was craving a Nut Job and so we took one to go.  If you happen to come to BLT, get the Nut Job: it's amazeballs! LOL.
