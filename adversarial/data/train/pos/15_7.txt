I drank the 34oz pitcher of Hoegarden by myself. Like a boss. The only challenge was actually LIFTING the 34oz pitcher.... which was a struggle.\n\nI liked Cornish Pasty Co because its simple: pastys, beer and a couple of sides. No worries if you're vegetarian or pescatarian or whatever the hell you're in to these days (seriously people!)  they have every kind of pasty you want, and all delicious.\n\nI got the sheppard's pie with the traditional fillings (mash potatoes, gound beef, peas and carrots) and gravy dipping sauce.  \n\nMmmmmmm, the delicious taste of an English heart attack.\n\nThe pasty was decent in size (filling enough for a whole meal for sure), came piping hot and had great flavor. The gravy dipping sauce was the best and they should probably put waaaaay more of it on your plate than the small cup you get with your pasty. Add some side orders of their chips (garlic and jalapeno please) and you've got yourself a manly meal. \n\nFor those into decor: this place has it. Very simple style, candle-lit and long tables, almost picnic-style. Easy, simple, down to earth. I don't need more than that.\n\n5 stars all around. Did I mention that I finished my 34oz pitcher of Hoegarden? Like a Boss? Really, I did.
