It took me forever and a day to finally visit Sweets Raku and then I made two visits in one week! It makes me feel like kicking myself for not visiting sooner. \n\nIt's the tiniest, cutest little shop and despite the small location and the long line it's well worth the wait. \n\nI ordered different treats on each occasion and they were all excellent. Japanese desserts are some of my favorite since I don't have much of a sweet tooth and they are perfectly suited to my palette. \n\nDelicate flavors and beautiful presentations are the name of the game here, I can't wait to visit again soon.
