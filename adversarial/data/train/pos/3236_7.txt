Everyone should have a go-to Chinese takeout restaurant. That place that is stored in your phone and whose menu you don't need to be able to order. Hong Kong is mine.\n\nDo not expect atmosphere (or even tables of any kind). Do not expect frills. Do not expect fortune cookies with your takeout (which does seem a bit stingy to me, but you know what I can overlook it). Just expect tasty food and friendly staff (even if the girl who took my order last time did look like she wasn't out of elementary school).\n\nI am a huge fan of the Beef w\/Garlic Sauce combination dinner. It comes with an egg roll, which is never overly greasy and always has a nice balance of cabbage and non-cabbage fillings. The fried rice is good, though not exceptional, and the beef is joined by an assortment of peppers, baby corn, carrot, celery, mushrooms and probably some other veggies I can't remember. It is listed on the menu as hot and spicy but don't believe it.\n\nDid I mention that I get three dinners out of one order? Now that's value, my friend. Tasty, tasty value.
