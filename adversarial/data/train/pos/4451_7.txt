Okay, so much hype, so I had to see for myself.  I warned my other half in advance that it wasn't the BOGO of Montana Meat Co., and it also wasn't going to include fries.  I'm big on self-preservation.\n\nWhat I didn't know was how big and unpreposessing the place was going to be, with its abundance of unadorned tables and lack of any decor save for some modernistic Asian-influenced \"art\" on the walls.  Kinda like \"Decor by Bed, Bath and Beyond\" on sale (and don't forget those 20% off coupons).  You can eat the ambience, and my appetite wasn't getting all that stimulated.\n\nLuckily, the burgers were excellent (we both had Ronins, medium).  They had a Pear Cider special for $4, so we had a couple of those, and shared an order of Salt and Pepper Garlic Fries.  We liked the aioli that came along with that, but the dressing for the burger worked as a dipping sauce, too.  \n\nWhen the burgers were delivered, I didn't see how I was going to bite into that gargantuan creation, but figured out quickly that if I press down and hold the chrome-dome top of the bun, I could compress it enough so that I didn't have to eat with with knife and fork.  That would have been way too difficult, since no forks were provided, just one serrated knife to share, presumably to cut the burger in half.  \n\nWhile we enjoyed our burgers and fries and the service was excellent, Bachi is somehow missing that je ne sais quois that would compel us to return on a regular basis.
