I understand that this place just opened, but they have a long way to go make it a viable business. First, they are very disorganized. I arrived at 11:35, five minutes after their opening, and very little food was prepared for their hot choices. Instead, I ordered from the menu, and was told that it take 15 minutes. It actually took 30 minutes. Although the dishes I ordered were all flavorful, there were several problems. The samosas were ice cold, not even lukewarm. The naan did not seem to be homemade and was of fair quality.  The nutter chicken and chana masala were both very tasty, and the portions were of good size for the price. The young men who worked there were casually attired and could have been more professional.\n\nI suppose I will try the place again, but if you are interested I suggest stopping by to pick up a menu and then phone in your order another day to avoid the wait. The owners could have a successful venture if they improve the appearance, service, and quality control.
