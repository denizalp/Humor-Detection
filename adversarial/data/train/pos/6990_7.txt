We went here hoping to have a little fun with the family for my 8 year olds family birthday get together. We figured that since my son loves tacos and with the outdoors, music, drinks and fun things to do, this would be great place for all! Not so much. We didn't even get to try any of their food. We got there and tried to order 30 tacos...just regular tacos...nothing crazy...but enough so that we would have enough for our group. Well, they told us we couldn't do that. So we asked if we could place some smaller orders instead. We didn't mind if it came out separately at that point. They said no because they wouldn't have enough food for everyone else. It's a taco place that couldn't make us 30 tacos???? Whatever we tried to suck it up and asked what the best way to handle it would be so that we could have food for everyone and the manager that came up to talk to us just shrugged and turned around and walked away! Seriously weirdest thing ever! Thought the idea of this place seemed super cool...but the service sucked and we didn't even get to try their food so I can't comment on that...but we will not be retuning. Too bad...could have been great...but it won't last long with service like that :\/
