This place is the best when it comes to waxing. Gill is my go to technician. She makes a usually painful waxing experience into a pleasant, not so painful experience. She's not only sweet but she's gentle. She's the best wax technician I've ever been to. No joke. \n\nAlso the staff here is great. They're always great with confirming and reminding you of your appointment and always great you with a smile. I've been to other wax centers before but this place is the best I've been to. \n\nIf you haven't been you must try it out and ask for Gill. They have much better hours than most salons too so making an appointment shouldn't be hard. Plus if it's your first time they give you a free wax up to $20 I believe. Check it out! What do you have to lose? Besides a little unwanted hair?
