I can't believe I've never reviewed this place.. \n\nI'll try to fit in all I can muster about my favorite China Town area restaurant.\n\nMy mom's Thai and a really good home cook. But since we're all grown now, she doesn't make huge family style meals anymore. So. This is my go to Thai restaurant.\n\n\nIt's not fancy, it's not over priced, it's not a new take on Thai. It's pretty much the classics done simply and executed well. Plus the price is definitely right. I'm pretty sure nothing is over $10..I think.. Well..  maybe! If you do seafood it might be.\n\nMy favorites are definitely the same as most yelpers:\n\nNoodle house style pot stickers are always a good start.\n\nNoodle house Tom yum soup with choice of noodles which I get the fat noodles- spice a 10.\n\nMy favorites include: Roasted duck curry 75% of the time, duck Fried rice(ask for chili in it and it makes it even better), the roasted duck soup with egg noodles, fried chicken over fried rice, BBQ park and Chinese sausage fried rice, lad nah, grilled beef salad with a side of sticky rice, their version of pho lol, Tom kah kai, and pretty much everything on their menu.\n\nIt's all really good.\n\nMy only let down was the pork wonton soup I got tonight with egg noodles. Fresh, but a  pretty bland broth.\n\nA huge plus is they can make their papaya salad LAOS style, which I prefer, and it's actually really good :] \n\nWith Ling Ling as the best server ever and down to the padak on the table as a condiment, this place is pretty authentic and never disappoints me. \n\nIdk if this is for regulars but the service is always super sweet. If I don't finish something for ANY reason I.e. Being full or saving for later.. The Ling Ling always asks if i enjoyed it or if I need it replaced if I may not have liked it. So nice :]\n\nIt's tiny so expect a tiny wait at times, the food is worth it, and try not to sit in that center table when it's sunny..\n\nRandom thought:\n\nMy favorite thing about eating a Thai meal is that it's usually family style. I wish they had an options of ordering a bowl or pot of some of the dishes.. If that makes any sense :] but I'm sure there's a reason they dont offer that. Limited table space..?
