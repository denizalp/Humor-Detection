I don't usually drop off the dry cleaning but alas sometimes I must help. The poor old man kept using garbage bags for transporting laundry and I was sick of it. I made it into the nice humid space and the man behind the counter greeted me with a cheery face. I bothered him for a reusable bag as some people want to do their part for our planet. He did not hesitate to give me a bag, he is probably happy he will never have to throw away a trash bag of mine again. He proceeded to ask me if the kid could have a sucker and me, always being the sucker I am for strangers with candy I gave in. The kid was happy. C'est la vie.
