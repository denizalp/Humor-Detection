KOA is in the business of serving travellers.  Well, when the hours of Montreal construction that I ran into a few weeks ago while driving OVER 12 HOURS from Halifax delayed me to after 9 pm, I did not think anything of rolling up to the KOA, I've done it before all over North America.   It was dark and locked up, but when I went to find a tent site it seemed to be a muddy, mosquito infested swamp.  Back to the front I called the number.  You know darn well they live above the office, but they would not open up and rent me a cabin.\n\nI had to drive another hour to find a decent hotel.\n\nKOA is a giant money grab, and this just proves it.  They obviously do not need to bend over back anywhere for their customers.  This particular one was just the same almost 25 years ago when we stayed there - nothing's changed.  Give it a pass.\n\nIn fact, give camping in Quebec as pass entirely.  Do not, ever, leave the highway following a 'Camping' sign because you will find they are all permanent resident parks - the signs should not be put there for tourists, very misleading.
