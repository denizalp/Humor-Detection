Some kid shows up at my door at lunch today with a Sage Pest Control shirt on. First, it's lunch time and I don't know about you, but I don't like having my lunch interrupted by some stranger knocking on my door trying to sell me somthing. Second, it's 100 degrees outside and he's soaked in sweat and he reaches out to shake my hand. Umm, no thank you stinky, sweaty boy! Third, he's pushy...VERY pushy. He tells me that I don't even know why he's here or what he's offering. Actually, I do. You will offer to scan around my house and find insects,. You will try to convince me that I have a problem. You will then have the magic package tthat will save the day for several hundred dollars. \n\nAnyway, this kid could not read my body language, did not listen well when I told him it's a bad time because I am eating lunch, and then he's got offended that I did not shake his sweaty hands.\n\nWhoever trains these guys needs a lesson in manners. Needless to say, I sent him away.
