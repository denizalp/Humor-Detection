This place was packed on a cold Friday night in the dead of a Toronto winter when most  people would just rather find some place warm and quiet after a week of work and slogging it home every day in -18 c weather. So that's a good sign.\n\nThe concept is pretty simple. There's a bar side and a small theatrer side. You can congregate with your friends before the show in the bar and then bring your drinks and foods into the theater for the show. \n\nIt's a mite confusing for the first time visitor and staff seems to assume you know the set up. \n\nFood and drinks, there's nothing too surprising save for Sapporo beer on tap (Go University of Sapporo Vikings! Victory over the Shimamatsu Red Skins forever! Boys, be ambitious!). \n\nFoodwise the menu offers a surprise: a Montreal-style steamie ($5 including slaw). I don't get out much but this is the first time I've ever seen that Montreal delicacy on a Toronto menu.\n\nMore about steamies here:\n\nhttp:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Montreal_hot_dog\n\nThe theater seating is pretty minimal. Mostly low rent banquet style chairs and a few bar type tables. You probably want to finish your grub.\n\nThe entertainment appears to be mostly small improv acts cutting their teeth in the world of stage comedy. It's a mixed bag but always refreshing to see comedy not ready for the Comedy channel.\n\nThe crowd is young and are mostly there to laugh. It's a pretty supportive atmosphere over all for the young comedians.
