Scott is a rude and stuck-up, prissy unprofessional businessperson.  Everything he promised us he didn't deliver on.  The jacuzzi and TV weren't functional, the room smelled of old socks, and he was always on our behinds to \"follow the rules, not to stay out too late, because we'll walk up the other guess...,\" even though no one was even staying near our rented room!  Then, after we departed, and were constantly reminded that Scott was \"too busy to help us fix anything in the room,\" we were told that there were books and antiques missing, and that was going to charge our credit card for hundreds of dollars...nothing was ever taken.  Don't stay here if you value your sanity and desire peace and quite!
