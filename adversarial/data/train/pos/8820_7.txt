After Mother's Day dinner we were leaving Green Valley Ranch and know how good the Grand Cafes pastries are so took it home with us. This location is very large and even last night the pastry counter was really busy . Everyone wanting a tasty treat to share with mom. When the cashier recognized that it was our turn she was very pleasant and friendly. She was very professional and properly handled the delicate pasties, individually wrapping each one. \n\nWhen we got home it was time for our pastries. They all made it home safe and sound. We took home some of everything which features a brownies, choc covered strawberries, an eclair, coffee and cream cups, and tiramisu brownies bites. There was nothing bad to say about any of them. The best of the bunch was the coffee and cream cups. When you get done with the whipped cream and mix inside the cup, then you eat the chocolate cup.
