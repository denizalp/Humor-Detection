Who doesn't love pierogies? My pal mentioned that she wanted to go out for pierogies, but didn't know where to go in Toronto. I went on Yelp a couple of days ago and found Loaded Pierogi. We decided to check out this 'Hot and New' restaurant this afternoon while everyone else in the city was checking out the Santa Clause Parade. This place is small and cozy; they share a space with Hanks so make sure that you go through L.P.'s doors instead. The menu is extensive with a variety of unique pieorgi dishes, including butter chicken, kimuchi, and cheeseburger. We found the 'Baba's Classic' to be the winner; sometimes simple is the best. However, we also enjoyed the Cheeseburger Pierogies. L.P. also has a bar with a Vodka Flight for $12. Price points here are super reasonable considering the amount of food you get. We found service to be quite good as well. Can't wait to return and try their other pieorgi dishes.\n\nGood for: lunch, pierogies, drinks, take out
