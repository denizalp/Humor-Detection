Blueberry Hill missed the mark on this location. \n\nThe place has an awkward layout and looks a little dirty. The Christion books and statues for sale are pretty strange too. The service was nice enough but a bit slow. \n\nThe Sausage Skillet was pretty good. The French Toast was great but I hate fake maple syrup. The Eggs and Hash-browns were oily. \n\nThe best thing was the Blueberry Muffin with whipped butter but you can get that anywhere. \n\nSo sorry, but this location only gets 2 Stars from me. Maybe the others are better.
