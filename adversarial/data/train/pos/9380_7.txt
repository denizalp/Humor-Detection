Butterfly Wonderland owes my visit to Yelp.\n\nI was scrolling through Yelp and I saw the pictures of previous Yelper's visits, so I wanted to check it out.\n\nBUTTERFLY WONDERLAND\n\nButterfly Wonderland is the largest butterfly conservatory in America. \n\nIt features an indoor conservatory that brings a tropical rainforest environment to Arizona where thousands of butterflies fly freely.\n\nButterfly Wonderland is located at OdySea in the Desert, a 35-acre entertainment destination that features 3 live animal attractions - OdySea Aquarium, Butterfly Wonderland, and Dolphinaris.\n\nTHE STORY & SERVICE EXPERIENCE \n\nButterfly Wonderland on the Salt River Pima-Maricopa Indian Community reservation, just east of the 101 Freeway at the Via Ventura exit.\n\nThe main ticket window sells the tickets for both OdySea and Butterfly Wonderland. \n\nThey offer packages for both the Butterfly Wonderland and OdySea. For just the pass to the Butterfly Wonderland, it was $24+tax.\n\nThe main entrance was cute, just NOT a \"WOW\" factor for that price.\n\nImmediately after I went through the ticket gate, they tried to usher me into their 3D theater for a 15 minute show, which is practically mandatory before they allow people to go to see the butterflies, but it was filled with families with children, and that's just not my scene, so I opted out, and went straight into the butterfly room.\n\nThe butterfly room is one big room that looks like a mini copy of a tropical forest, obviously filled with butterflies.\n\nThe staff gave me some helpful instructions, and was available throughout the exhibit. They also set some fresh fruit out from time to time, which invigorates the butterflies, so they're easier to see. I liked that part a lot. It brought out some butterflies that I wasn't able to see on my own.\n\nThe butterfly space is pleasant and pretty. The butterflies are really fun. I had one butterfly sit on me for a half hour. I don't know what makes that awesome, but it really was a good time.\n\nThere is a small snack shop which was overpriced and had minimal crap and sodas.\n\nThere is a reptile exhibit and tropical fish aquariums that was interesting.\n\nThere is also a gift shop with overpriced tchotchkes.\n\nCONCLUSION \n\nI love taking photos, and it's a good place to get a few pictures with some pretty subjects in a nice environment.\n\nI liked the experience, but it's not worth the money to keep coming back.\n\n4\/5 RECOMMEND\n\n*Discount packages available.\n\n*Available for group events.\n\n*Plenty of parking out front.\n\n*For more information: butterflywonderland.com
