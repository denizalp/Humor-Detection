Returned back to Blondies after not so good past experience. Due to bad review regarding one of their crappy cracked out severs we were asked to come back on owner vonns behalf for complimentary drinks. I decided to take my brothers into blondies for some drinks and appetizers. This time I chose to sit at the bar\/ table  with 5 of my buddies. We ordered tap beers and some appetizers. Chicken wings, potato skins, nachos and some fried pickles. Bartender was excessively slow for how dead the restaurant was for a Friday. Food was just blah , bland bar food which was  under cooked and overly fried which hid the frozen flavor I assume. Waited around for this Vonn guy who claimed to be the owner but no one was able to get ahold of him. \n\nAll the of the staff were sitting in the back booth on their phones, and eating. I asked multiple times for side of napkins and ranches ( almost walked into the kitchen myself). Place is trash needless to say, restrooms were gross, next time use Mother Nature it will be a lot cleaner. \n\nI just can't get with this place and I'm not sure why the health department continues to allow this place to run. Chicken bones on the tables and floors. Staff was less than helpful everyone was \"busy\" like my last experience. Trash was scattered all around the restaurant while everyone just walked over it. I wanted to throw up my blondies me\n\nThey need a HUGE makeover!!
