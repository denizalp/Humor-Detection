After walking into an awkwardly empty restaurant, we were seated by a VERY sweet young girl. She was the best staff member in that place, and she was probably 16. \n\nSat for 10 mins and no one came and gave us a menu or took our drink order. One waitress kept walking back and forth, and another was eating and applying her lipstick. Mind you, there are 4 other people in this place. At this point, I'm done and we are just going to leave. As we are packing our baby up to just leave, they bring the menus. We let them know we are actually leaving, and with a smile one of the waitresses says as we walk out the door, \"have a nice day!\" At least their early exit service is friendly. . . \n\nAgain, the young hostess was sweet and gave us the best service out of anyone in there.
