Let me preface this review with the fact that this is the most random location downtown by Fremont ever... If Whole Foods and Sprout's and a little cafe had a baby this would be the place!\n\nIt's actually a very cool place to get a meal or pick up random crap that is in your typical hippie or vegan form when shopping for groceries. \n\nWhat honestly stood out to me the most here was that every person working, every person eating, or shopping was smiling. This is a true testament to the employee loyalty and happiness when it comes to getting some awesome food. \n\nMy friend talked me into going to their first location down the street at the LGBT Center which we found out was closed permanently... Luckily they told us about their primary location which was down the street on Fremont. Their food is pretty awesome I must admit even if you like meat or vegan... The chicken goddess sandwich blew my mind!\n\nYou can get everything from smoothies to salads to sandwiches to some crazy-ass nuts in a bag to go. I plan on coming back here frequently for lunch!
