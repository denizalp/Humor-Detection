When you enjoy your faux-Napoletana pizza with cardboard-thin cracker crust and a faint drizzling of sauce, do you like to do so in a dining room with walls of plastic bricks and populated with boisterous children?  If so, you'll love Ciao Grazie.\n\nWe came here because we were going to be in the neighborhood anyways, and this place for some reason has mostly good reviews.  If only we knew the people who had eaten here are the same sorts who actually think Sauce makes a good pizza.\n\nThe meal started out OK.  The service was adequately warm, even if the over-the-top decor left it a little cold (it's OK for a restaurant to be unassuming - really, it is!).  The garlic bread was edible, even if it was just a piece of flatbread with butter and garlic salt on it.  Would have preferred actual garlic, though.\n\nThe pizza?  I went with the capricciosa, and my friend had the sofia.\n\nWhen our tostadas... I mean pizzas... arrived, the unfortunate lack of substance in the crust was readily apparent.  The cornicione was almost nonexistent.  I have said it before, and hopefully I don't have to say it too many more times, but if you think the cracker crust is good, you're absolutely wrong.  There are certain propositions that are not open to different opinions, and this is one of them.\n\nFurthermore, the toppings, besides the olives, were pretty lame.  The prosciutto on my friend's sofia was barely distinguishable from normal ham.\n\nCiao Grazie is all style and no substance, and the thin, lifeless crust serves as the perfect microcosm for the place itself.  If you like to eat that garbage, just go to Sauce, it's cheaper.  If you don't, do yourself a favor and go a few miles down the road to the far superior (and understandably more crowded) LAMP Pizzeria.
