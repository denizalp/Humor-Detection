Negative stars. Every inch of this property is filthy, shady, and in poor repair. Broken glass, broken door frames, filthy broken curtains, uneven floors. \n\nAll this I could let slide, but I used my debit card to pay for the room against my better judgement, and lo and behold two days later I have to cancel my card due to fraud. My card was used to make a small test purchase at a motel in Missouri, and luckily my bank has a great fraud detection department and it didn't progress beyond that. \n\nI'm embarrassed to admit that I even stayed here, but I would like to help others avoid making the same mistake.
