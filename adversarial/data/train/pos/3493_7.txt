I first tried Sarris Candies when my boyfriends mom sent him dark chocolate covered pretzels for Easter. It was love at first bite!\n\nWhen we visited his parents for Thanksgiving I insisted we visit the store so I could get more pretzels! The shop is adorable, it's huge, with a huge castle made of chocolate, and they have an ice cream bar!! We ended up getting chocolate covered pretzels and chocolate covered potato chips, both were delicious, let me tell you, they have some of the best chocolate covered pretzels I've ever had!!\n\nSo for Christmas I decided to order one of their holiday bash cakes for my family to enjoy. I ordered it online, it shipped on time and was delivered on time and safely within 2 days. Everyone at Christmas eve dinner thought it was so cute!  And oh man did we have a blast enjoying it, everyone took turns hitting it to break it up, and it was full of chocolate covered pretzels which were gone within minutes, and the chocolate itself was absolutely delicious. We had about 15 people sharing in it and had plenty of chocolate leftover!\n\nThe bash cake will definitely be a family holiday tradition and I highly recommend trying one!
