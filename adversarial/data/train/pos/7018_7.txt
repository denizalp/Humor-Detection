This is a smaller Chase branch just south of Windmill on the east side of Las Vegas Blvd.\n\nPros\n\n- tellers were very friendly\n- place was small, but very clean\n\nCons\n\n- they have only 2 windows available for customers, plus one window for business'. They seemed to have replaced 2 windows with automated machines. This can lead to atrociously slow-moving lines whenever there are more than just a handful of people inside. Gotta tell ya...pretty annoying..\n- not much in the way of good parking\n\nI like Chase and have been with them for many years, but I will certainly make it a point to avoid this branch in the future, if at all possible.\n\n2 stars.\n\nMeh. I've experienced better.
