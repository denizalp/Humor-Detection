Location: 3175 Rutherford Road Unit 31 Vaughan, ON L4K 5Y6 (same plaza block as the Starbucks)\nPrice: $$\nServiec: Good\n\nI find that Chatime has a really confusing option with the percentage of ice and sugar. So I usually just opt for regular ice and sugar (makes my life easier), and every time I alter the percentage it always taste funky. This location is not as busy as the others, I find. It awfully cold in there, maybe it's just the location of the door- dunno what's going on there.... On a good note, their halzenut chocolate milk tea is bomb.\n\nVerdict: ehh
