Lago was supposed to be our one \"nice\" dinner before heading out to party the night away during our girls weekend in Vegas. \nThe view of the fountains while you dine is unmatched. The food had some great flavors and came out quickly.... And that's about all I can say about what I liked.\n\nThe service was ok-ish. I didn't really think it was appropriate to have our server open up our paid bills at the end of the meal and check on his gratuities at the table as we sat there. \n\nAs I said the food had some great flavors. Jackie B and I ordered 4 dishes to share. The branzino was done very very well. The funghi was also very good. I was excited for the seafood risotto but was left very underwhelmed. Not enough seafood\/lobster to be called a seafood\/lobster risotto. It also lacked that creaminess you expect in a risotto. So definitely not even close to being worth the price tag. We then ordered a Cesar salad at the end of our meal because after sharing 3 dishes we were still hungry. Quite possibly one of the worst tasting and unappealing salads i've had. The dressing was awful, the portion size literally looked as if the chef took apart a head of lettuce and found the 5 smallest leaves he could find and put them on the plate, and whole anchovies staring at me made my stomach turn. We immediately sent it back.\nThe rest of our group is also sorely disappointed not with the flavor of their meals but with size of their dishes especially since this was considered our \"splurge meal\". \n\nUnfortunately Lago is not a place to come to with an appetite or a place to come to when you expect to get a decent sized portion for the price of each dish. Sadly I won't return. With so many other amazing restaurants in Vegas, this is one you can skip.
