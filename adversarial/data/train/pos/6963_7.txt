There aren't zero stars available, because if there were Pure would deserve it. I mean, any place that fetes Jersey Shore rejects cannot be taken seriously (If snookie is hosting Halloween I am going to be as far away as I can be. And that people would want to see her already shows you the kind of people that come here).\n\nYou walk up and you're basically treated like cattle, and that's actually giving them credit, so that you can get into the most unoriginal club I've ever been to. It's like they converted a warehouse into a 'club.' \n\nThe bouncers are self important and hold clipboards because apparently that raises the 'I'm so awesome' meter. Don't buy into it. \n\nYou finally get the golden ticket and you're herded into this big room where having your space invaded is a step-by-step happening. You cannot get away from people breathing on you, touching you, screaming in your face. It's obscene and unnerving. \n\nOh, yeah, TRY getting a drink in this place. If you can accomplish that I can assure you that you won't get a drink that is even in the same stratosphere as the drink you thought you ordered unless you ordered melted ice over some no-name liquor. Drink before you go and save yourself that blatant rip-off. \n\nThe music is fine for a club. That's all I can say about that.\n\nI have actually made it to the 'VIP' area several times (by virtue of knowing someone there) and ended up feeling like I was lording over the poor losers begging to get into it. I suppose if you want to pay cash to feel like a douche then don't let me stop you. \n\nThis club is way past it's expiration date. Let it die.
