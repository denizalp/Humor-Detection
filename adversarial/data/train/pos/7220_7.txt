I really like this spot. Very cool staff (the one guy looks like David Usher!), relaxed, large communal table, outdoor patio - overall a great place to spend your afternoon soaking up your vitamin D. \n\nAs stop number 4 on the CMYE East(er) End Espresso Crawl, we were all well into our caffinated mode. This was the only spot that I decided to have a little nosh with my joe. I opted for the chocolate pecan butter tart, and boy am I glad I did! Very delish - a cross between a chocolate shortbread and your grandma's butter tart. \n\nI loved that my coffee came in a glass. The texture was great and was for sure an excellent choice pour moi. Adeel and Will opted for the machiatto and seemed to be in java heaven. Greg went true to the crawl and had the espresso and was showing and teaching us the beauty of the VV's espresso. Susan had a sip and she was totally on the Greg VV vibe. \n\nI will be back to this spot again and again. I will also be singing ABBA every time I go as well (http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=za05HBtGsgU)
