So I'm going to make it simple. \nPizzas are overly priced and they're really not that great. On top of that, service is excruciatingly slow. We saw 2 different tables walk away because they couldn't place an order. \nIt has a nice ambiance since it's at The Linq, but I will NOT come back to this place at all.
