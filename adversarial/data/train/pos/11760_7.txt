This place takes your money faster than the casino. \n\nThe food is Michelin 3 star good, but damn is it it expensive. After eating at French Laundry, I said the same thing, but felt it was a deal; here not so much. \n\nThe decor and details are all there. I kept chuckling to myself every time  someone entered the restaurant, as the serene atmosphere was invaded by the noise and trash just outside the door. The contrast is really quite extreme.\n\nThe service is technically impeccable, but is missing its humanity. It seems their approach to training staff is to dunk them in a vat of French snobbery and call it a day. Seriously, the entire French population of Vegas works here. It just lacks the understated grace that is French Laundry.\n\nShould this review be listed under The French Laundry?
