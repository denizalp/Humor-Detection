Cane here to watch the euro finals game France vs Portugal. It's a beautiful place with picnic style benches, regular tables, 2 bars and couch area. \n\nWe were given water by the busboy and also menus. We were told at the bar we were sitting at that it wasn't open and we weren't going to be serviced over here that we had to go to the main one that was open to please a order. Hubs went to order a drink for me and walked up to the bar and was ignored by the Asian bartender. So he went to ask for some help at one of the cocktail waitress and was told by her she was too busy for him. One when we walked into their kitchen and asked who was in charge, and when he answered hubs said there should be someone to serve people at the no service bar. We have money that we wanted to spend while being here to watch the game.\n\nIMHO final euro soccer game yâ„´u should have more people on staff, it will get full, they're a bar what did you expected especially being in Las Vegas. And the people who are servers shouldn't have such a attitude when you're in the customer service industry, try being a little more polite just saying. \n\nWe sat there for the whole game ordered food and ordered drinks throughout, the bartender that we had made up for the fact that his fellow coworkers didn't have the same attitude as he did. \n\nOverall the place is very clean spacious, right on the strip, great for sports events, has lounging areas,  lots of TVs, 2 large bars and even giant games like connect 4 and jenga blocks.
