Ughhh, what is this place?\n\nAnd why am I here?   (thoughts running through my head last Sunday night)\n\nMy friend's bachelorette party descended upon this place after dinner and cocktails elsewhere.  I was ready for some debauchery, it was a given seeing the girls I was out with.  But I was not ready for the eye-raping, sleaziness and vulture-like behavior from the guys here....maybe I've been out of the club scene too long or maybe I thought men left that behavior back in the frat houses.  Guess I was wrong. \n\nDear Gentleman (I'm being generous with the use of gentleman), \nDon't come up to me and ask me why I'm not dancing.  Don't come up to me ask why I'm not smiling.  Do not stare at me like I'm a piece of meat at the butcher.  Don't approach me with the pick-up line of \"Are you Irish?\" so you can show off you're irish accent.  Hah, now I'm going to go up to guys and ask them \"Are you Jewish? Are you Catholic? Are you Swedish?\"  Makes as much sense as the Irishman's line.  (gross, I think I needed a shower right after that)\n\nI have to say, if I was drunker I would probably not have minded it so much.  But I wasn't, shame on me!  \n\nStars retained for the variety of music offered.  A metal cover band is a fun idea for a meat-market club, I guess.  DJ outside did play some decent tunes in between the prog-house drivel.  \n\nGiven the chance, I will not return.  Unless you get enough shots in me, then I may drunkenly reconsider my threshold for college-age debauchery.
