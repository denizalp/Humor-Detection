Still a solid 4 stars for me.\n\nAs far as buffets go, I still think Wicked Spoon is one of the better ones with its price point (we went for a weekday lunch at $27).\n\nWhat I liked:\n- truffle risotto was delicious!\n- oxtail pho.  Impressed that they would even attempt that.  I wish it was a bit hotter, but I give them credit for having that as one of their buffet items.\n- bone marrow is always an indulgent treat.\n- perfectly medium rare prime rib.\n- warm pecan pie was soooo good.  I got a scoop of vanilla gelato and added it on top, and it was amazing.  Worth $15 right there.\n- overall the food wasn't salty like a lot of buffets.  I didn't have to drink gallons of water after.\n\nWhat I didn't like:\n- some asian dishes could be a lot better, but that is nitpicking.\n- wish they had better raw seafood station, I don't expect raw oysters during lunchtime, but cocktail shrimp would be nice.\n\nA great value for the money and the food was pretty good.  I'd come back for sure.  Definitely get the warm pecan pie!
