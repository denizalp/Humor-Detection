A lively mid-range restaurant. The crowd was mixed, but was comprised mostly of families. Strangely they played clubby music in the background. \n\nService was really good, there were about five people servicing our table as a team. Everything came out quickly and they were able to accommodate all the bizarre dietary needs of our finicky group.\n\nThe food itself was pretty basic. The big eye tuna ceviche was a significant deviation from real deal, it appeared to have small pieces of tortilla chips mixed in which through me off. The chicken fajitas were fine, but weren't a huge step up from something you could get at a chain.\n\nFinal word: Ok for a casual or family dinner.
