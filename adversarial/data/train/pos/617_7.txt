This has to be one of the worst airports ever!  If you get dropped off (or picked up), you get yelled at for taking too long. Then they have double \"parking\" on drop off so you get yelled out for not being able to move. Huh?  Once inside you're kind of on your own...not a lot of signs to direct you to the right place. If you ask for help, you will more than likely be \"greeted\" with an unfriendly \"yeah\".  The only reason I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 is because they do have free wifi.
