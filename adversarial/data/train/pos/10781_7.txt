ZERO STARS \nRACIST EMPLOYEES \n\nI asked for double General Tso's and apparently that's a outlandish request. So what if you have to make more! Your not closed for another hour! Make more! I'll wait! \n\nHe asked me what I wanted but than continued to yell across the store to another employee. I had to wait for him to shut up so I could order. \n\nEvery Hispanic person who walked in was greeted! One lady even requested fresh chicken to be made when the one wasn't even empty. His response to her was sure no problem and told her it would be 7 minutes! YEA IM WHITE AS A GHOST BUT I ALSO SPEAK SPANISH! \n\nSo next time don't assume I can't understand you complaining about me! Assholes.
