YOOOO, the best place I went to when I was in AZ. they have the best horchata in a coke bottle- no lie. the food is bomb.com. I got the fish tacos with a side of seasoned fries. my bf got the pulled pork burger (which we're not usually pulled pork fans) but that was pretty good too. The burger was not dry at all and everything that it came with including the fries just went well together! I def recommend!
