Not just your average burger joint. With Angus beef organically grown and fresh ingredients there's nothing to feel guilty about except that you didn't come here sooner. This is a trendy unique little place in a shopping plaza. The glass architecture allows for a brightly lit dining experience\n\nUpon arrival you're asked to take a menu and you are seated. When you are ready to order just walk up to the counter and place your order. I ordered the El Diablo burger. They asked me if I was ok with a small ribbon of pink in the middle. I was good with it. Most places don't ask.\n\nMy burger and fries were out in a reasonable amount of time. My burger was cooked exactly as they said it would be. It came with lettuce, caramelized onions, tomato, habanero and serrano peppers, and a spicy mayo sauce. All this was piled on to a slightly toasted bun. For all the spice it didn't take away from the flavor of the burger.\nThe fries are made from honest to goodness potatoes, not the frozen processed ones. They still had skin on the tips. Slightly over cooked, but still good.\n\nThis was a good dining experience and I will be back when I'm in the area. My only regret is that I didn't try one of their signature milk shakes.
