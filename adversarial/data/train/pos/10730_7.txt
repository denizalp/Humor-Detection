I'm happy to report that we have never had a bad experience when we visit this club! Every time we've had bottle service, the process has been flawless and the price has always been right! Andrew, who is one of the main bottle service promoters is THEEE Best, and truly will take good care of you from start to finish. \n(*Please private DM me for further info, if you'd like the hook for your future Vegas needs) \n\nMy group and I arrived just before midnight, and with the ridiculous line at the entrance, because of our table reservation we were able to completely bypass the line and enter right away. From there the ID\/Body checks were performed and within minutes we were taken to our table with no problems. In some clubs, it's nice to be on the second level, but at Light I recommend the first level, either the middle lower level, or the dance floor level. Why? Because the music sounds sooooo much better, these tables have so much more dancing room, and the view of the entire club is perfect. On some nights they have a mini cirque de soliel show that goes with the music the DJ plays, so by sitting on the lower levels you get the complete experience! \n\nThe main reason why Light is one of my favorite clubs is the vibe and complete ambiance once inside. The entire club turns into lights and really makes the party. The screens show lights that match the music and the production is amazing to watch. The music is always, always in point and the people inside just want to have fun; there isn't ever any rude or overly drunk people around. The bottle service table always has a security assigned or at least near by so it feels safe. Danielle, our go to bottle service server takes such good care of us as well! \n\nBe sure to visit Light LV on your next Vegas Getaway! ... You won't regret it!!!
