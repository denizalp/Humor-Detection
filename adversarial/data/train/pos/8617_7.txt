My dog is cuter than your dog. Seriously, there is no argument you can make to the contrary. He is simply the cutest dog in existence. Because of this, Buckley deserves the very best, so I constantly have my eye out for new shops to spoil him at. Today I came across Petique while waiting for my computer at the Apple store.\n\nThe deal is, The Biltmore donated the shop space to the Humane society.  The Humane Society in turn created a really cute little retail shop and adoption center. \n\nIf you have a small dog whom you enjoy carting around please check out the carriers here. They are some of the coolest I have seen in awhile (especially the sugar skull decorated one). \n\nI picked up a toy, some treats and poopy bags. The poopy bads are especially of note as they are decorated in a skull and cross bone pattern to let others know \"Don't eff with me while I am cleaning up my dog's poo\".\n\nThey also had three or four dogs and a wall full of cats for adoption. The people were knowledgeable on the behavior of the dogs and when I inquired were able to tell me which they felt would and wouldn't be a good fit for the person I was inquiring for. \n\nThey do not have the biggest selection of products but what they do have is great and TAX FREE. Yup non-profits can do that. I'll be back to treat my pound puppy quite a bit I'd imagine.
