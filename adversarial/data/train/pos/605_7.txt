Stick to Hooter's, y'all. First off, let me say for some really strange reason, I love breastaurants. So I was pretty excited to try Twin Peaks. When it comes to food, the fried pickles were the best thing I had, but again Hooter's is better. For an entree, I got the  blackened fish tacos. These were pretty darn disgusting. The biggest letdown though, were the wings. What kind of sports bar has crappy wings?!?!?! Twin Peaks, that's who.\n\nFurthermore, the lumberjack-y theme was cool, I guess. But the plastic wood and rock decor trashed up the place. Is it that expensive to invest in a real dang rock? I'm sure nobody else even noticed this. But it was off-putting. There were a lot of tvs, however, rather than sports, half of them were turned to this bizarre Twin Peaks promotional channel.\n\nOne more thing that probably didn't matter to most, but peeved me were the girls. Well not so much the girls, or their little outfits, but the gaudy jewelery and belts. Like we see you walking around half naked, why do you have to wear a giant pink rhinestone belt and gargantuan fake necklace too? All the girls had so many gaudy, non-matching accessories, it really just made them look trashy. Again, I'm sure nobody else would even notice. But it bothered me.\n\nAnother thing, our waitress was really weird about giving my boyfriend his military discount. Which maybe it's not standard procedure for them to give military discounts anyway. But it was still a strange situation that did not get Twin Peaks any brownie points.\n\nYou can find me eating a mile or two down the road at Hooters, and for the love of breastaurants, I hope you make the same decision.
