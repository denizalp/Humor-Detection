***I'd like to update this saying that I have been harassed for some of my reviews, including this one, by some super obsessed creepy person with too much time on their hands.  The purpose of this website is for individuals to state their take on businesses, thus I am doing so, and there is no wrong or right when it comes to Yelping.  If a business gains a negative review, perhaps that is their chance to do some soul-searching and work on what people point out as a deterrent.  In the end, running an establishment poorly is what will cause it to go out of business.  Not one grain-of-salt review on a website.***\n\nYou know, when I was a kid I often wished for the super power of invisibility, and Visart is the only place my wish has come true!  To say the customer service here is elitist and crappy is an understatement. \n\nYeah, they might have a wide selection of everything and anything I'm looking for, but giving someone money and then being treated like I'm not cool enough to be renting what I'm renting is not something I really enjoy subjecting myself to.  At least with Netflix nobody is judging me and I don't have to wear pants to choose my movies.
