Garbage...absolute garbage.  Too bad yelp doesn't allow us to rate places with poop emojis or garbage cans instead of stars. This is the worst of all of the Feast Buffets, and we have tried them all. \n\n1. Entry logistics are terrible. Long line, no rhyme or reason to the flow of people, or seating protocols. \n\n2. Food is sub par, for the price. Comparable buffets have considerably better food options and quality. \n\n3. If you have kids, please don't bother. Local or otherwise, skip this place. $14.99 for a 2 year old at breakfast, and they can't seem to figure out how or where to place a family requiring one or several highchairs. Just plain ignorant to the needs of their patrons. Expect no less than a 15 minute ADDITIONAL wait if you need more than one highchair. \n\n4. Hand me a pen that works when you want me to sign a credit card receipt. If your sales counter does not work with the pen that you handed me, get a different pen or counter or whatever...I am being picky here, but please, don't make it annoying or difficult for people to give you thier hard earned money. You are part of a very successful casino chain, you should know how to be efficient at taking people's money by now. \n\nWe live in one of the service capitals of the US, and we are accostomed to \"service with an smile\", and pay\/tip well for these services. If you decide to eat at this buffet, expect NO service, with a blank stare. \n\nTo reiterate, this buffet is complete garbage in all aspects. Pay a little more and go elsewhere, or don't eat at all. You will add years to your life by not consuming this trash, and avoiding the aggravation.
