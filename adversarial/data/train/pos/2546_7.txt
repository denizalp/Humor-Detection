5 stars for service\n1 star for food \n\nI came here because I remember seeing a picture of this delicious ribeye on Facebook. There were only 3 people at the bar when I walked in. The bartender greeted and we sat at the table. \n\nOne look at the menu and I was immediately disappointed - no ribeye. She told us that the kitchen staff has changed so new items on the menu. \n\nShe recommended dry rub wings which we got but they were okay. They didn't have either of the two entrees - The Biggie Burger or the Chocolate Fried Chicken. They didn't have Crown Royal. No napkins. Geez. So what did they have? \n\nI'd say the crab cakes were the best thing on the menu. The tacos are horrible - bland and tasteless - do not order these. \n\nThe bathroom had a funky moldy smell. I would not come back here.\n*****************************************\nA message to Stephen after your rude comment to me. Not once did I ever say the service was bad. The bartender was fabulous. I simply posted my opinion on the food I ate. But after seeing your reply (as if I was in the wrong) I don't know what to think? Take this as constructive criticism or room for improvement on the food. \nAnd if you have time to read Yelp reviews, perhaps you should have time to buy some bar napkins for the place. That is all.
