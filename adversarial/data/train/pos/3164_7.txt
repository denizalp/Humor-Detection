I've had Tarbell's bookmarked for as long as I can remember-- I'd heard and read about local chef celebrity Mark Tarbell's 2007 Iron Chef America victory over Chef Cat Cora, so it's been a wait of ten years!\n\nA friend and I just finished a lovely bottle of white with charcuterie from a wine bar nearby and wanted dessert, so we both checked our Yelp apps for bookmarks and Tarbell's came up.  Turns out he's never been to Tarbell's either, has never even heard of the restaurant, and all it took were photos of a cheesecake and profiteroles and the decision was made-- my wait was over!\n\nI had no idea that it's so lovely indoors!  We walked through the entrance to find a crescent-shaped bar in the middle of the restaurant, with an open kitchen behind it and a few tables lining the walls to the left and right of the bar.  There were colorful abstracts under subdued lighting on the walls, and I appreciated that it wasn't very dark inside.  (I'm not a fan of dark interiors kept dark to induce low inhibitions.  Part of the magic of dining out for me is the plating of the food, as well as the use of colors and textures to create beautiful ambience.)  Tarbell's is intimate and has a lively energy, as well.  And there's no doubt that the bar is center stage and the place to be, at least for dessert and cocktails!  I hadn't planned on having any more to drink besides water, since we already had cocktails elsewhere, but a man sitting to our left offered to buy us a round, but with his choices of alcohol.  (He'd heard me nix the whiskey sauce on one of the desserts we'd chosen, so he instructed bartender Mikey not to give me anything corn-based.)  Turns out he's a liquor supplier of Tarbell's, or something- hey, I was buzzed and busy taking a photos of the orange hippo sitting on top of the coffee machine and our gorgeous desserts! https:\/\/www.yelp.com\/user_local_photos?select=A9-EzvvbpUonfivsDlyEng&userid=M9rRM6Eo5YbKLKMG5QiIPA  I didn't enjoy the gin-based mojito drink I was given, but I thank you for your generosity, anyway!  Friend enjoyed his twist on an Old-fashioned and Sazerac.\n\nBut what about dessert?  We couldn't decide on profiteroles or bread pudding, so bartender Mikey said he could give us half of each; an order of profiteroles includes two pieces, so we were given one. https:\/\/www.yelp.com\/user_local_photos?select=h2lEoTL6fB4NZZWBWuavtg&userid=M9rRM6Eo5YbKLKMG5QiIPA  The profiterole turned out to be massive!  I've had them before from different places, and the standard sizing is much smaller.  Not here, and it came with vanilla gelato and delicious chocolate ganache.  I didn't get to inspect the gelato or even get the chance to ask for more ganache, because my friend pretty much inhaled most of the dish (and I can't blame him!).  The bread pudding was the complete opposite of the profiterole.  Granted, it's half the size of a normal serving, but was it TINY!  If I weren't allergic to the pecans I didn't know were included, I might've cared, but I enjoyed the two bites I had, and really, it was the salted caramel sauce that made this dessert shine.  https:\/\/www.yelp.com\/user_local_photos?select=zCSkzDMeRKTWIrjw-j80hg&userid=M9rRM6Eo5YbKLKMG5QiIPA\n\nI definitely want to return to try some apps, an entree (or three!), and perhaps the Apple Crisp soon!
