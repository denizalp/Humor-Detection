This is an excellent park to take the family. With their basketball courts, skate park, playgrounds, dog parks, and pools, this is one of the largest parks on the west side. If you don't have your own pool their indoor and outdoor pools are worth checking out. The outdoor pool has a shallow water area and playset that's great for really young kids and a deeper area with two water slides for older kids and adults. Admission is $2 for kids 3-17, $3 for adults, and free for kids 2 and under. They also have a 90-day family pass (good for 4 people) for $100. There are locker rooms with showers on the premises with coin operated lockers and ones where you can bring in your own lock to store your items. It's a great place to take your family whether or not you live close by or are visiting from out of town and want to get away from the strip.
