Seriously, THE best place in town for comic books. It's huge, it has everything you need, the prices are amazing, the staff is helpful & knowledgeable, and they even put aside all the titles you collect for you every month!\n\nI go every week but that's because I'm afraid for my budget, otherwise I'd rent a room in their dollar bin section and just read comics & drink coffee for the rest of my life.
