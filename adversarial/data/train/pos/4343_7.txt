2 and 4 stars. There's no value in them. If a place is a four that means it's better than most, but there are specifically designated spots that are better. I'm not taking home silver, ok? But if a place is a two that means it's moderately bad. It's obviously not good. It's probably actively bad. But the 2 star gives it a special designation that neither 3 nor 1 stars gives it. There are better basic bars. This is boring.\n\nTo be honest, I'd rather come to this bar than other bro college bars. To be honest, I'd much rather go to some other bro college bars than this bar. It's just middle of the road bro-ey and college-ey. Sometimes friends or family or pretty girls will want to go here, and you know, that'll sway me more than any dumb opinion I've ever formed. But I don't want my memories of Madison to be, \"I won a bunch of cheap drinks at flip night and that's how I met your mom.\"\n\nYou all have a friend who has done that. Maybe two of them. They might be in love. Think about how nice those friends are. I'm sure they're really, really nice.\n\nThis may seem like an indictment of all college bars in Madison, and maybe it is. To be honest, I haven't stepped foot in this spot for years, so I don't even really know. But if you feel so compelled to read a review of this historic institution, I do have a few questions do pose to you. Where do the musicians hang out? The grad students? The aspiring politicians or theater kids? The kids that rap or throw paint on walls? I don't mean where do you see them, because of course you'll see them here. They're all pretty much bullied to come here, and they don't like any other spot in this city enough to complain that this place is not as cool.
