A sign on the wall says this Subway served subs to the United States Secret Service during a Bush visit to Phoenix. Wow! Unfortunately, the fact that it served subs to the people who take bullets for the president still does not make its subs anything special.\n\nOf course, if you like lettuce, by all means, come here fast. If it's the end of the world and I'm craving a sandwich, I'll throw a brick through the window of a Subway--this location or any other subway. God knows they probably have, without fear of hyperbole, a million bags of vacuum-packed shredded lettuce under their counters.\n\nAnyway, did I say that someone whose job it is to take a bullet for the president has eaten a sandwich from this Subway?
