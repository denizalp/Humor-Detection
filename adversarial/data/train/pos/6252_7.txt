This place is small. Great ambiance for a sushi place. They had NBA on so that was awesome in my book. It was not busy at all which made me wonder why some tables were left uncleaned.\n\nI guess this place was once Xtreme Sushi since they still had super old menus with the old name. We came here because I got super hungry after going to the park nearby and TSC was already closed. They have AYCE and I kept going back and forth as to whether or not I should get AYCE.\n\nAll I really wanted was soft-shell crab and sashimi. So, I skipped AYCE.\n\nSoft-shell Crab:\nHuge pieces of crab tempura. The dipping sauce was pretty good and citrusy. 4\/5\n\nSashimi:\nI got 7pcs: tuna, hamachi and salmon. The bigger orders of sashimi include octopus. The quality of the fish was alright. They were small and thinly sliced...with a dull knife. The tuna had a weird fruity taste to it. 2\/5\n\nThe service was so-so. Overall, this place was marginal. I wouldn't drive all the way out here just for this since I live on the opposite side of town.
