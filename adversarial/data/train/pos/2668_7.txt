Ok, it gets three stars. Last year, two. What's changed? The smell of smoke is getting further and further away.\n\nWe stayed in the West Tower. Avoid Manor court unless you're budget bound. In January, the pool is closed. Fuggetaboutit.\n\nThere are small improvements. Food is just a bit better, like coffee. The shops aren't mindless tchotchke stores, although they get there.\n\nThen there are the time-share buzzards that troll the lobby, dressed like they were hotel staff. They chat you up like a Turkish rug salesperson, offering free tickets, but it's all about selling time-shares. These trolls seemed to be sanctioned by the hotel, which dropped the entire rating from a four to a three-star. \n\nAdd in the Resort Fee, which ought to be illegal, and the price of Circus Circus gets less and less attractive. Maybe I should go back to a two-star. Nah. The rest of the staff was pretty helpful.
