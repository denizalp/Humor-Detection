Came here for dinner with my friends! Tried it a few times in California, so I was excited to try the Vegas location. Parking is super easy because it's located at the mall, the wait wasn't long for my big party. The interior is nice, though the tables were kind of small, but that's just because we ordered a lot at once. The menu for dinner has 34 options, we managed to try almost all the beef options. Food came fast and the portions are a good size so you don't order way too much at once! Terry and Luke were EXCELLENT and attentive! Though it was busy, they still managed to handle our table and also make the experience fun.
