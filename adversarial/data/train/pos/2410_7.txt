This is my first negative review because my experience with this co. upset me and could have cost me THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS.  In May, I called a handful of companies to tend to a large Ficus tree that was causing problems in my yard.  Only 2 called back.  Top Leaf's quote (by Levi) was nearly THREE TIMES what the other co. charged me.  This would have put the cost in the thousands vs. the hundreds I paid!  The other company didn't even know I already had a quote either!  I suggest getting at least one more quote if you're thinking of working w\/Top Leaf.
