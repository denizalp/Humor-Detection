Five stars because I have absolutely nothing to complain about.\n\nI truly miss Cafe Novo in Bloor West Village, but decided that it'd be a worthwhile trek to Kensington for this wonderful cafe, noting that it's probably one of the only cafes in Toronto that uses organic milk. \n\nI came here three times this week, and do not regret my visits one bit! Each day, I've had the pleasure of being served by three separate employees, and each of them were incredibly kind, funny, and welcoming. Although the cafe is still setting up and finding its groove in its new location, the food and the service seems to have nestled in comfortably. The space is beautiful and cozy. Music not too loud, which is always a bonus. \n\nI've tried their cappuccino, latte, and an Earl Grey tea. All very delicious. The espresso drinks were velvety, warm, and homey (is that even applicable to a drink???). Tea is steeped with love and care, and not just tossed into a bag and thrown at you without attention. Cafe Novo also carries several vegan + gluten free desserts (cookies are from Bunner's, I believe), so all my conscious and paleo friends...grab a bite and stay a while.\n\nPrices are incredibly reasonable. I was pleasantly surprised at the prices for drinks using organic milk (organic milk costs more than double the price of conventional milk). How amazing is that? I have no idea how they keep their prices so low, but I'm not complaining! \n\nWill probably frequent Cafe Novo at least once a week, not to catch up on readings or pretend to get any work done on my laptop, but simply to sip up a frothy, dreamy cappuccino, undisturbed by the nuisances of city life.
