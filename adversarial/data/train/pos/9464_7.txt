Hubby and I met Julie P. and Julia T. for Sunday brunch recently. Having enjoyed Havana Cafe, we were eager to try this more homespun version of Cuban food. \n\nAlthough consistently hopping, there seemed always to be a seat for newcomers. Service was slow at times, but to be fair, there did not seem to be quite enough staff to serve everyone. Our waitress was also a busser and cashier, and remained friendly in spite of clearly being overwhelmed.\n\nThe buffet itself had many different items, and I liked some more than others. The beans, rice, fried chicken, yucca, pork, and chicken soup were all stand-outs. The whole table ended up surprised that what we thought was a strip of beef ended up being liver. The rice pudding was also quite good, as were the items we ordered off-buffet, such as the tostones (fried savory plantain patties) and the far sweeter quartered plantains. The flan was the second best I have had in the Valley (first being Comedor Guadalajara). We were all glad we had the experienced Julie P. to guide us, and we stayed a long time, conversing, digesting, and getting to know each other. I'm sure Hubby and I will be back to experience more, especially as it seems that the menu is not static.
