This location just opened up on 17th Ave.  The space is nice and large enough for big groups.  The menu is has a good variety to choose from.  There's an efficient electronic ordering system...you pick and click and a few minutes later, food is on your table.  The service was pretty good, consistent clearing of our plates and filling of our water glasses.  The best items we found were the beef short rib, sashimi (decent thick pieces), sushi rolls, shrimp tempura and dessert (Mango pudding and yogurt, plus ice cream...pretty decent selection).  We also ordered the chicken wings, which I enjoyed, nice and crispy.  Other items such as beef tataki, dumplings, deep fried chicken nuggets were in our opinion, just ok.  We did try the pad-tai and was not a big fan, although, the portion is small, easy to finish, so if you'd like to try for yourself, go for it!\n\nIt's $26.95 for all you can eat dinner menu. Although its not the most mind blowing meal you'll ever have, food comes out quick and service in our experience was good.  As with all \"all you can eats\", its about what you order, the menu is extensive enough to sample various dishes which will allow you to determine which dishes are the best and keep ordering those.
