Achtung! Go eat schnitzel at the Schnitzel Queen. Schnitzel sandwiches are HUGE, cheap, super-tasty and fresh. Go early to avoid the crowds in this tiny (4 stool!) joint. Me and a pal plowed through our sandwiches so fast, they gave us another on the house, just to see if we could make it fit! We did.
