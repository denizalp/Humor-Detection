The Moxy has definitely a different feel from any of the other Marriott locations I've stayed at. \n\nIt's got a great vibe to it. Once we walk in, it's like a bar with the check in counter. I will admit, it was slightly confusing. They do have some popular drinks and it was nice to stay there. Also, if you happen to get food there, get the breakfast naan - definitely delicious! \n\nFree yoga on Sunday mornings (with mimosas). Pinball machines in the lobby area. Free bike rentals. Pool cabanas and a great pool area. The gym was alright, but not the main focus for most people I think.  The staff was awesome and remembered that I was there for a hot air balloon ride so kept asking me about it. LOVED IT. \n\nThe service was great. I will admit, it was loud some nights. I really wanted to sleep some nights really early since I was getting up early the next day and this place was just...okay in that regard. \n\nAlso, I do wish they had a closet instead of hangers on the wall. \n\nProtip: get a drink and a naan. They are delicious.  It's definitely a great different kind of location.
