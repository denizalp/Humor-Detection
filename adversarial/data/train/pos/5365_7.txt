I love the food at Butterfields. Most recently I tried the whole wheat french toast, with a side of strawberries and bacon. The french toast was very light and fluffy and not dripping in egg batter. Our server was friendly and fast. I've never had bad service here!\n\nMy only cons are the prices. They charge $2 for a side of strawberries, which would be fine except it was literally ONE strawberry sliced up. A side of bacon (4 pieces) is $3.95. I wouldn't mind paying that for a thicker cut...maybe even peppered bacon, but this wasn't anything special. \n\nI definitely recommend Butterfields. If you go on a weekend, plan to arrive before 9:30 or be prepared to wait AT LEAST 30-45 MINUTES. But you won't be disappointed!
