Very poorly planned opening of this location:\n\nUnprepared\/untrained employees \nNo air conditioning or even a fan\nScanner not up & running yet on this, the 2nd day\nHot tapioca balls in what is supposed to be a cold drink\n\nI visited Kung Fu Tea on their 2nd day of being open.  After waiting in line for 20 minutes, it was my turn to order.  The employee taking the orders couldn't answer my questions.  It was so hot in the place that employees & many customers had perspiration on their faces.  A customer who had ordered before me wasn't informed that they were out of what she wanted until she'd been waiting for over half an hour.  They call out order numbers when they are ready, but mine say there on the counter along with 2 others quite awhile before I finally asked if one of them was mine.  I had ordered the \"no sugar\" option but my drink was incredibly sweet, so I believe it was made incorrectly.  I couldn't help but notice that there not one employee smiled during the entire 45 minutes I was observing.  It seems that they weren't even trained to be pleasant, or even thank customers.\n\nI won't be back for some time, if ever.  Other places make bubble tea here.  The Grand Asian Market in Stallings, Whole Foods locations, & Chok the Noodle in Indian Trail are a few.
