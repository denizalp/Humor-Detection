I visited Popped for the first time over the summer and I fell in love. I think I came home with at least seven bags of popcorn on that trip. Since we were in Vegas for Thanksgiving, I told my BF that we had to stop here again.\n\nOn Friday morning before we headed out of town I pulled Popped up on Yelp and let my phone guide us there. We quickly realized we were not going the right way, and I of course blamed the shoddy iPhone maps app that has let me down on a couple occasions. But, it turns out the phone wasn't wrong - Popped opened a new location, and it's much closer to the strip!\n\nThis shop is tiny, but they still have everything that they had at the original store. I tried a few samples (Pumpkin Spice Popcorn - you must try it!) before loading up on many large bags. Since it was Black Friday they were giving a 15% discount, which was awesome.\n\nI'm so glad Popped is doing well enough that they can afford to open another store! And i'm glad it's in a more convenient area :) Now they just need to open one in the OC!
