We new it was going to be expensive going in. $45 for 2 burgers, a poor attempt at a grilled cheese, 2 sodas, fries and onion rings. \n\nWe had a 2 year old with us and they sat us at a 2 top, ever try sitting at a 2 person table with 3 people and one of them is a 2 year old? Yeah, its never fun. But we saw three 4 tops with 2 people at them.....emmmm, not sure what happened here. \n\nIf I am going to spend $45 bucks on a burger lunch. Please clean the cobwebs off the lights and boogers off the walls.
