i don't have much to compare this with in pittsburgh because this is the only place i've lived in pittsburgh......i did however check out the heinz loft when i first moved here and i thought the cork factory had a better deal (price was right) it also had a better atmosphere and better apartments.  anyways this is how i feel about the cork factory:\n\nthis is a gorgeous, unique, clean apartment complex.  they have a free happy hour for residents every thurs night!  wine and pizza are served.  FOR FREE!  they have some killer grills out back in between the river walk and the pool.  i loved going out last summer, throwing some dinner on the grill and having a cocktail while waiting and people watching.  \n\nthere is also a gym with 2 flat screens, 4 treadmills, 2 ellipticals, free weights, and some basic weight lifting machines.  it gets the job done!  \n\nthe apartments are all different in size and shape and have a great lofty feeling to them.  the apartments are open- meaning they don't have bedroom doors and the bedroom walls do not go all the way up to the ceiling.  those ceilings are mighty high.....\n\nit's also a plus if you work downtown.  no car necessary.
