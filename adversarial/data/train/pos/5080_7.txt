Tasty latte, comfy chairs, mellow tunes, warm sunshine... this is life. I haven't been here since last fall but am glad I stepped into the new location yesterday afternoon - the transformation was a pleasant surprise!\n\nThe old location still serves as Br√ªloir's 'laboratory' where mad coffee scientist and owner Vincent continues to experiment and roasts a vast variety of beans and tests different blends to cater to its clientele varying palates. The difference is he now has more space to service his machines, store more freshly sourced beans and most importantly more room expand his imagination to craft and concoct the perfect roasting formulas.\n\nI've been told that the reason he got into the process of roasting his own coffee grains was to gain control over the outcome.  Interestingly enough, the secret to torrefying coffee beans is part science and part art as you are working beans that contain thousands of chemicals and when you apply heat to it, quickly cool it, many things can happen. Acidity, sweetness, mouthfeel, flavor are all important factors that goes into the final result.\n\nThe Torrefication process is very conditional, even if you have best ingredients you'll never really end up exact same results but there's one thing you can be sure of is you'll always end up with a fresh batch of roasted beans (vs pre-packaged).\n\nSo what are the final results? None conclusive so far as there are still so many to try but I must admit that trying different brews in a welcoming and naturally bright sunny space makes it so much more enjoyable. If I were to pick on something, I'd say that the foam art is terrible, but who cares right?\n\nOh forgot to mention that the menu includes bagels, breakfast sandwiches, scrabbled eggs with feta & bacon, grilled cheeses, pizza, soups and local sweets to satisfy your hunger.\n\nCan't wait to come back and savor the next drink, and test some more grilled cheese on 'to the be built' outdoor terrasse!
