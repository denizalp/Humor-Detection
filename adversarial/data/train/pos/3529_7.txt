Last night I received some of the worst customer service of my life at Los Dos Molinos - Ahwatukee. The GM was our waiter (black shirt and handle bar mustache) but didn't offer his name. I ordered a dish that did not have cheese listed on the menu (the flautas) and asked for no sour cream. I have a slight dairy allergy so I thought that was good. The food comes and I notice there is cheese on the flautas. I apologize to the kitchen staff for not knowing and asked if I could get it without cheese thinking that would be the end of it. I had never been there before and the other places I had ordered the same dish from didn't have cheese. Honest mistake...\nWell the GM comes over and sits down in our booth and says in a very condescending tone \"something wrong? We need to have a chat\" and lectured me on why it was my fault for not knowing that everything on the menu comes covered in cheese. Keep in mind that many dishes listed cheese under the ingredients but this one did not. He was extremely rude during the whole exchange.\nHe then proceeds to make a loud obvious jab at us when taking the order at the table next to us. \"Thanks for voicing your preferences now instead of after you get your food. Saves us all time!\"\nThe sad part is he obviously knew he was wrong or at least that we were upset because he never came back to our table. I went up to the bar to ask him for our check and he proceeded to avoid me and briskly walk to the back of the restaurant. Another much friendlier waiter helped us out.\nThe rest of the staff was great and the food was good but I cannot believe someone who is in a position of leadership talks down to customers like that. \n\nThe extremely poor service outweighs any food quality in my book so this one gets a one-star and no repeat business. It was not just our table either. He talked down to everyone when taking orders. He either needs a lesson in customer service or a new job!
