The Cortesian recently came under new management during the summer and I've had a great experience with it so far.  I recently moved out to Scottsdale for work and I'll boil down the perks of The Cortesian in four quick points:\n\n1. VERY CHEAP! Is it the most fanciest place in Scottsdale? No. But you'll pay half the price or a third of the price compared to San Marin or Palladium and still be within walking distance to Old Town.  \n\n2. Respectful and prompt management team. Every time we submitted a report, the maintenance guy would come fix it within two days.  Even when we had huge packages that we accidentally delivered to the front office, they held it for us without a problem.\n\n3. Renovations. Brand new state-of-the-art laundry machines were put in place so you can see which ones are being used online.  New pavement and 3 swimming pools.\n\n4. Clean.\n\nDefinitely check out this place first if you're in the area. If you want a cheap low-key place to live right near Old Town, this is the spot.
