We had really hoped to be more impressed. It's not that the food isn't okay... it's split. Some of the tapas plates are worth the $10-14 cost... half are not... (and all portions are skimpy).\nFor two people, you order 7-8 tapas.. so there's $50 bucks of your meal that will be for just ok food... sorry that's just not good enough... (at what should be a top notch Strip restaurant).\nWith a $50 bottle of unimpressive wine, you'll be in for $150 plus tax and tip.\nWill you be drawn back for a second try... maybe you'll remember the pluses over the shortcomings.. don't think we will though.
