Stopped in around 2:30 on a Friday, and despite the wait (around 10-15min total to order and get my food) it was delicious. \n\nOrdered the cookies n cream with chocolate macaroon, and Thai boba tea. The ice cream was great, can't beat that it's homemade! Not enough cookies in my opinion, though. Macaroon was perfect with it, nice & gooey\/chewy :) I love trying new flavors and foods, but when it comes to ice cream I have to order cookies n cream. Having said that, I do want to try their other flavors like honeydew ice cream, or, dare I say it, their durian! \n\nfor their drinks, I love that this place has custom sweetness levels (got mine at 50% or half the usual amount of sugar), and the boba was good too. The milk tea is brewed on site & delicious. Like it actually tasted like freshly brewed tea. Also, even without my $1 off via yelp, the drink price of $2.22 is pretty amazingly low. \n\nThere are two downsides - one was that there was only one employee in there, so one guy had to take orders and make all the food\/drinks. The party in front of me ordered three milkshakes, so that took awhile to make. The second is that they don't have a Henderson location... Please come to Henderson!! \n\nAnyways, I'm definitely coming back!
