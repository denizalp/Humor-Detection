Worst service, worst food and worst customer service I have ever had. First my drink order was delivered wrong. Next my appetizer of BBQ ribs was so over cooked it was like eating leather from the gloves that OJ used to kill his wife. My wife ordered Kum Pow Scallops and specifically requested that it NOT be spicy. It came to her as spicy as if she hadn't said a word. I made the mistake of ordered the sizzling seafood platter. That dish came out so over done that I could not remove the lobster meat from the shell without it coming out in shreds. It stuck to the shell like they crazy glued it in. When I complained I was told that I shouldn't have ordered that, I should have ordered something else. I was flabbergasted by the waitresses statement. I informed her that information would have been much more useful before I ordered that mess. I informed the waitress that I was not interested in eating anymore and requested that it be removed from the table. I assumed that dish would be removed from my bill since I ate about 2 fork full of it...I assumed wrong. When the bill came, there was the sizzling seafood platter still listed at almost $16.00. I complained and asked to speak with the manager. The manager came over to informed me it was their policy not to remove anything from the bill but to replace it with another item from their menu. Since both my wife's order, as well as my order was horrible, I decided to skip the possible food poisoning and to merely pay the bill as it was. I included a tip of ZERO which I clearly spelled out on their bill. \n\nThis was without doubt the worst dinning experience I and my wife had ever had at a Chinese restaurant. STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE! DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY! \nThe food, the service and everything about this place was terrible! I hope to God I do not get food poisoning from what I did ingest.
