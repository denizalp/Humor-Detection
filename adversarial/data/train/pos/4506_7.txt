Okay FUCK THIS PLACE!! My friends and I came here not knowing philly sandwich co. had relocated. We had already walked all the way down from the other side of old town so we said \"Why not?\" even though the sandwiches are fucking 8 bucks plus...ridiculous. So we order, and my friends get their sandwiches within five minutes. I waited at least ten for mine- the place wasn't even busy and the girl was just letting it sit there while she brought out other orders that were placed after mine. I made eye contact with her several times before saying anything and she still didn't do anything. When I said \"What happened?\" she said \"What did you order?\" and then she finally brought it. I don't know if she thought she was being cute or what- but it wasn't even that good- fine for food after drinking, when you're hungry, but any other time-no. The worst part is that I TIPPED HER. Fucking bitch. It will take no time at all for this business to tank. Wish we had known that Philly was just around the corner. :\/ Whore. I hope karma will give it to you in spades when you're out of a job!!!
