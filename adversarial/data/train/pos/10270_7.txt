I was feeling down yesterday--I needed a fix, and fast. Fortunately, as I was driving east on Thomas, what should appear on the right but a new pusher shop for what I'm addicted to--chocolate ice cream. I quickly ducked into the tidy little Pink Spot and looked over the selections, looking to feed my addiction.\n\nI settled on the old reliable, made from dark roasted cocoa beans sez the tag, to satisfy my craving. [sorry, I'm just not into coffee ice cream, thanks anyway!!] The nice lady crammed a humongous scoop of the Dark Cocoa Brown confection on a plain cone [my fave!], and she even put the whole thing into a cup for me so I could drive off with my fix. \n\nThat said--the selection is kind of thin, it's like a Fresh & Easy version of an ice cream joint. It's in the old Willo candle store, so you know there's gonna be at least some parking. $2.95 for a big scoop of ice cream was a bit stiff IMHO, but when you're jones'ing for an icy chocolatey treat, no cost is too high.\n\nNext time I'm gonna try a sundae...looks like there's plenty of chocolate fudge sauce for my addictive cravings.
