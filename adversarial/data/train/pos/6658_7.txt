Ok. I'm officially a fan of this place. We tried it a couple nights ago when we met a friend from out of town. Good decision. \n\nThey start you off with a small bucket of pizza flavored popcorn and things only get even better from there. Hubby and I worked together for the whole meal, ordering different entrees and deserts so we could share. \n\nHe got a burger that was covered in teriyaki sauce, little fried haystack sweet potatoes and a tempura avocado. The main flavor here was definitely the teriyaki. The sweet potatoes gave a nice crunch and the avocado provided a smooth, creamy texture. \n\nI ordered the current burger special - a Thanksgiving burger. It had a turkey patty, a patty of stuffing and was topped with cranberry sauce. The salty from the stuffing and sweet\/Tart from the cranberries complimented each other very nicely. \n\nFor dessert, hubby got the cookies and cream shake. It was an Oreo shake topped with a cookie ice cream sandwich and the glass was rolled in cookie crumbs. The ice cream sandwich was decent - nothing life changing, but certainly yummy. The Shake was actually very well done, and this Is coming from someone who's pretty picky. It had a good amount of sweetness and was very creamy. I loved the cookie crumbs on the glass. They were stuck on using a thick, white icing that stupid sweet and delicious. \n\nI went for the Peanut Butter Crunch Brownie. Although it's much smaller than their epic shakes, this little thing really packs a punch! It had layers of dense brownie, chewy caramel and peanuts. This is definitely what I go for when it comes to dessert and I would absolutely order it again!\n\nThis place was fantastically fun and we will absolutely return!
