Randall's massage  was absolutely disgusting! I felt violated & uncomfortable when he massaged me and he didn't have much strength!  Very limp hands & flimsy cold fingers. I got a Groupon and that's how I found out about Randall. The price of course is what attracted me ($20\/hour) unfortunately, you definitely get what you pay for. His social presence was awkward and he wasn't genuinely cordial. There was this weird modality that he did on my face tapping his fingers and he spent most of the massage sitting which I guess if that's your thing that's cool. But I'm used to receiving excellence when I get a massage. I absolutely would not recommend this practice at all! #IRegretGivingHimATip
