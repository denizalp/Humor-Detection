Always great here we love this place cause there so nice and the place is clean and comfy!!!!! Cold Amstel also a plus !!!! My fav beer can't go wrong with that......;)the 8 ounce steaks came out great perfect and two side Cesar salads and mash ..... Hit the bellies great !!!!! The only thing bad was the sangria tasted like pink watered down lemon aid with a strawberry just sitting in it doing nothing very weak !!!!' But all was great.....  Stick with beer and wine and if dinner will be great..... Servers are the best and manager always comes out to check on u to make sure ur happy with meal and I love that that's how u run a buss!!!!
