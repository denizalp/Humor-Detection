Does it matter what towing company you use?  Before my experience with Quik Pik I would have said no, \"They're all the same.\"  Unfortunately that is definitely not the case with this company.   The driver, David, was rude and abrasive,  suffering from some inferiority complex that made everyone around him cringe.  When I called the main line to voice my concerns and express my issues with his conduct and professionalism,  I was dismissed.   \n\nI cannot stress enough or warn others to avoid this company.   I would rather push my car over 100 miles in the middle of an Az record breaking scorching summer, burning my hands in the process,  than call these incompetent, negligent \"tow specialists.\"
