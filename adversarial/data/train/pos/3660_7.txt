One word, AMAZING! \n\nWho knew such deliciousness existed inside of a gas station? \n\nThis place definitely takes the cake! \n\nI walked in and there was only one guy working the grill. He took our order pretty quick and it was done in 10 minutes. I went with the nachos and my honey went with the chorizo tacos. The food is a few cents cheaper than your average Roberto's but way better quality. \n\nI had to steal a bite of the chorizo tacos and they are to die for! I had never tasted a better chorizo taco, not even in Mexico! My nachos were pretty good too. The guy makes the chips from scratch. When I was speaking to him he said everything was brought from California, even the meats, that's why the food tastes so much better, better ingredients. \n\nThis place is only a few streets down from me so you can bet your shiny pennies that I'll be making it my mission to visit weekly.
