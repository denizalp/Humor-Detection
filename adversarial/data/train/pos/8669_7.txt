No stars for this place. OK it made me place 1 :-( \nI am a big foodie and previous food service director. when trying this place I did not find there hospitality to be welcoming no explanation of menu when. Stating it was our first time we found you on yelp :-( \nCustomer service was they never came to check on us we had to flag them down or ask for assistance.  Remind you this is a small place should be no need to lack in this area. \nI ordered menudo when it arrived there was no hominy in it only tripe and broth. \nWhen I questioned this serve said it comes that way unless customer ask for corn. He never expressed that to me when I ordered.  The eggs were burnt  and portion small for 4 of us to eat was 70$ not worth it at all.
