I love Costco, I have for many years but it is not some place I would typically choose to write a yelp review about because I think everybody knows what they are getting when they go to one of hear of it; a high quantity of an item for a pretty good savings, and a few taste tests of items while you walk around. Now however Costco has a new tool to make them even better.\n\nThe biggest problem with Costco has always been the crowds and lines a check out. Well they have no figured out a way to alleviate that by letting you use your membership card to check out a portable scanner that slides into a nice litte mount on your cart. You scan your items as you add them into your cart and then when you are ready to leave you head to the self checkout it totals your cart and you pay, then you are all done. No waiting in line to hoist 30 packs of Monster or 100 rolls of toilet paper onto the check out conveyor. \n\nThis time saver has fixed the problem of long check out lines making Costco even better.\n\nNow if they could just stop with the silly receipt checks at the door on the way out and teach people in the parking lot how to drive they would be all set.
