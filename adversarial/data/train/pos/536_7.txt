Terrible customer service -they care more about upholding their unethical corporate policy than their actual long-term, loyal, elite status paying customers.  Good luck if you ever accidentally book a room with their advanced rate and try to change it.  It doesn't matter if you change it within three days and 3 MONTHS prior to your stay  - they can care less. They will take your money and will hide behind their policy.   I'd go somewhere else.  I give them one star because I can't give them any less without a post.
