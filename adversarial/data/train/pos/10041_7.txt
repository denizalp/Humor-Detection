Here's what you'll like.\nThe salsa bar. \nIt features about a dozen types of salsas, ranging from traditional to the more obscure pecan.\nThe cochinita quesadilla, which really doubles as a Mexican stromboli only deep fried and not baked, is a culinary triumph.\nAnd the artwork, all of which macabre -  depicting 'Dio del muerto' scenes -  is erie to say the least, but colorful and provocative.\n\nHere's what you won't like.\nYour missing car if you don't lock it and set the alarm.\nThe chairs - likely designed by an orthopedic surgeon whose life's mission is to rid the world of scoliosis, one taco aficionado at a time.\n\nIn their defense, the chairs look to be some kind of Mexican relic, something they found in an old Mission or something. They're artsy and very heavy carved wood. \nOne problem.\nThey're so heavy, when you stand up, attempting to furtively sneak to the salsa bar for the fifth time hoping no-one will spot your sloth-ass in the process, they'll give you up in a New York second as they make the most God-awful racket scraping the bare floor. \n\nI don't like it when I'm trying to be sneaky and some inanimate object signals everyone, warning them of my intentions to abscond with the entire salsa bar, greedily hogging it all to myself.
