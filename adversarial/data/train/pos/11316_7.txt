I had the fit and healthy breakfast.  But it was not tasty.  I disliked the wheat toast, it tasted weird (old?), the fruit cup was not fresh and fruits weren't sweet at all, fruits looked slimy especially the watermelon and strawberry.  The egg white mixed with cheese, chicken sausage, mushrooms, spinach should have worked but it is put together in such a way that it looks nasty and it tastes wrong. Chicken sausages are brutally chopped sometimes in tiny pieces, sliced or torn in chunks, like a murder scene. \nFood was slapped on my plate like a punch on my face.\n\nBUT Staff is nice and helpful.  My hubby picked the waffle with sausages and eggs. Waffle wasn't cooked thoroughly. Small OJ (minutemaid) costs $3.49.  It is my second time at the black bear. Shame on me!
