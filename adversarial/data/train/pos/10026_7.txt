From the lovely coat check person\/greeter to Antony our server, we were treated so warmly, patiently and with great care.\n\nVery sheik restaurant in haute couture location of Rosedale, five minute walk north of the Subway station. Parking on nearby east-west streets.\n\nUsed OpenTable to book a 615 pm Valentine Dinner for me and my gal and we were not disappointed. We left at 830 pm satiated, smiling and seriously happy.\n\nI'm a meataterian and she is a vegetarian so our dinner plans are sometimes a struggle - meaning that usually one of us are happier than the other. Not tonight!\n\nI dined on the marrow salad and the steak with baby potatoes and green beans, while she had the veg consomme soup with gnocci and vegetarian moussaka (hearty caulliflower).  Everything was excellent, including the buttermilk biscuits before the meal.\n\nAs you'll read from other reviewers, all the food is local...well, almost all. They had to go outside the 100 mile limit for tonights menu but not that much.\n\nThe wine list is outstanding with so many excellent Niagara wines...looking for some great Prince Edward County wines soon...such as Rosehall Run or Troumpers Mill. \n\nAttention to detail is the norm at Earth. If you care about what goes into you and you want to feel cared for, try this lovely oasis.
