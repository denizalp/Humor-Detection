Another home run for Yelp. . .correction--another grand slam.\n\nThis is a small, unassuming place with non-descript decor that has absolutely knock out Mediterranean food.  It's got the general type of menu that you see at all of these spots (gyros, kabobs, etc.), but be prepared for intense, delicious flavor and LARGE portions.\n\nDid I mention FREE BAKLAVA with your entree?\n\nWe had to take a minute looking for the place, but it was worth it--apart from the food, there are really friendly folks here and the joint has a nice atmosphere.  It's hard to maintain a five star average rating, but this place has amazing food, and you get a lot of it for a good price.  That's what does it.\n\nIf you didn't know about this place before, now you do.  GO there.
