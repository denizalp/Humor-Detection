Aria is try-hard. \n\nThe check-in guy made the worst small talk I've ever encountered. Utter dribble. Tried too hard to be friendly and came off super awkward and superficial. \n\nThe rooms try too hard to be modern.  There are several sets of buttons in the room that do different things depending on the state of the room. Totally not intuitive, guys. Try to be more like Apple and less like Microsoft with your design choices.\n\nThe rooms themselves are high-quality, clean, and look modern. If you're going for a sexy night, then it does the trick.\n\nATT signal quality was poor in my room on the 18th floor, such that it would take about 5-10 min to send\/receive messages. So, if you're making a rendezvous, you might want to communicate from the lobby floor.\n\nThe supposed iPhone\/iPod dock takes a proprietary connector that you must buy from the wet bar for ~$30. What a rip-off. So, bring a male-to-male audio cord that plugs into your headphone and into their line-in jack.\n\nAlso, I could hear a family through the adjoining door in the room, so perhaps they could also hear me, my gf, and our $30 iPhone music at midnight. Oh well. I paid $$$ for the room, I'm gonna use it.
