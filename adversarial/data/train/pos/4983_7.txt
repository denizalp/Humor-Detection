I really love this restaurant! This was my third time. Now, first off, the first thing that I didn't like was the absence of the three different butters that they used to have. Now, it's this maple butter that neither one of us liked. But, our waiter did bring us regular butter which helped the situation. The lavash and the other bread were both delicious. I started off with a Caramel apple martini which was pretty good. But, it was a little more bitter and less sweet. For my second martini, I got my usual lemon drop and it was perfection. Our entrées were delicious. I had gotten the lobster Thermidor the first two times so this time I got the filet mignon and the lobster Thermidor. I have to say, the lobster Thermidor was more like just Lobster on a tail then the actual Thermidor, but it was still rather good. And the fillet mignon was broiled to perfection. He got the filet mignon with the shrimp scampi. Both of our entrées came with mashed potatoes and vegetables that were also delicious. He got the chef's tasting menu. And, the lobster bisque he loved, but the scallop was just one tiny scallop. He shared it with me but it was just one. I thought there would be at least two or three. Also, for dessert, it was a crème brûlée and I believe a chocolate mousse that came with his chef's tasting menu and it was tiny also. Barely enough to share, barely enough for one. All in all, I still give this restaurant a 4. The food was rather good and the views are breathtaking. Afterwords, we did go to the observation deck inside and out and took spectacular pictures! The restaurant slowly rotated all around & we saw breathtaking views of Vegas in all it's glory!
