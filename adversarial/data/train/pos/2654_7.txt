If you are a pool party newbie like me, please read below for my top five tips:\n\n1. We bought general admission tickets ahead of time online to see Diplo on a Sunday and arrived at 1pm. Two hours after opening, only had to wait about 5 minutes to get in. I don't think buying expedited entry tickets are necessary.\n\n2. Come hydrated. A small 12 ounce water bottle costs $12. There are no free cups of water.\n\n3. Renting a locker costs $50...ridiculous, I know. But you do get to open and close it as many times as you want so I guess that is a \"perk\"\n\n4. Those fancy drinks served in yards? Not even close to what you pay for the ones sold on the strip. You'll need at least $65 (depending on what kind of alcohol you want in it) if you want one of these.\n\n5. Do not go on the pool stage if you are a drunk mess. I saw a bride twirl on the pole and fall on the side of her body (ouch) and it was all over Instagram. Not cute.\n\nThis club gets crowded but there was plenty of room to walk around in and outside of the pool. We were there from 1-3:30 though, so I can't speak for later in the day.
