Purchased a real nice looking 7ft Christmas treeDecember 2016 from this Home Depot location.   Had great service from the Christmas lot attended. \n\nHowever Christmas Eve woke up to a nymph tick infested tree 100s of ticks filled the tree and floor around the tree.  \n\nJust bad luck I guess, unless this happens to anyone else who also purchased a tree at this location.  So I am posting review.   Wondering who else had this bad luck
