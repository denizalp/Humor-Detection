6\/24\/15: First Canadian restaurant I have ever tried!  Seems very similar to Starbucks (which we passed a ton of on the way too btw.)\n\n1. Classic Butter Tart C$2.50:  I liked it. Like a pecan tart but with caramel flavor. 6\/10\n\n2. Vanilla Bean Latte Medium C$4.45: About what you would expect. 5\/10\n\nAnd now that I got some sugar in me from the 4hr flight from San Francisco and one hour spent with the highly unfriendly EZ rental car company... I'm read to eat Canada all up!\n\n3\/5\n\n#canada #coffee
