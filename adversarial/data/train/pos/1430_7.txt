This is the second time I've been here and I really wasn't impressed. The crowd isn't as laid back and casual as I like (was it just me or did everyone look like they went out clubbing?) but the prices for beer are pretty average.\n\nThe first time I came here was pretty decent. They have a large selection of beers on tap and the sweet potato fries were ample but a bit on the pricey side. Didn't stay for too long as I felt it just wasn't one of those warm and inviting places.\n\nThe second time I came here was right after midnight on a Friday night. We were  served by a pretty cold, if not pissed off waitress. Funny to say this, but I almost felt pressured to order something quick for fear of pissing her off any further. Within about a half hour it was last call, then when we were sorting through our bill she came over with the portable credit card machine and insisted that we fix up the bill right then and there while she waited. Talk about wanting to get us out of there quickly.\n\nI probably should add that the layout of the interior was quite nice; high ceilings, overall clean look of the bar, but the bathroom is in a very inconvenient location way in the back, down a flight of stairs, around the corner, etc. Ladies, bring a friend for company for your long journey!\n\nI probably won't go in there again. There are tons of better bars in the city with cooler vibes, much better atmosphere and friendlier waitresses.
