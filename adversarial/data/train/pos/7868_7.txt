Ever get the feeling that some people have the wrong expectations about gyms (and gym memberships for that matter)?  Reading through some of the other reviews, I would say that could be the case.  \n\nThis gym is nicer than most gyms out there and has a very new feel to it.  It used to be a 24 Hour Fitness so you will see some of the dumbbells clearly labeled as such... but the weights and equipment are in really good condition and relatively clean!  And it has all the amenities of other LA Fitness locations (that a lot of gyms do not have)... like a pool and a basketball court.\n\nMy only knock on this LA Fitness location is the lack of some of the equipment that I typically find (and use) at many other LA Fitness locations.  There could definitely be another squat rack (or two)... and a second decline bench would be helpful during those busier gym times.  Also, for some reason there seems to be a conspicuous shortage of ten pound free weights.\n\n****FOUR STARS****
