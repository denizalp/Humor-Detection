I was blown away by how GOOD this place is. I'm not a fan of bread\/bagels\/baguettes.. anything like that really. But my friend and I stopped by and when I tried his fanzette with cheese (basically a gourmet croissant with a sausage and cheese- looks like a westernized 'cheun jai bao' for all my cantonese folks)\n\nThe pastries and baguettes look super fresh and they are not understaffed at all. So many people working hard in an assembly line and customer service was great. The pastries are also very unique and they have stuff like a pizza croissant. They also had a staff giving out free smoothie and baguette\/cinnamon bun samples- THE MANGO SMOOTHIE BLEW MY MIND. Also, very fresh samples because when I came back a second time ten min later to get my own cheese stick (my friend's fanzette taste lingered in my mouth and begged me to come back for more. That tease.), anyway- new samples were out. Yum! Only downfall is that it is a bit pricey- his fanzette was around $5... \n\nVery efficient although there's always a inevitable line here. I'll try the other things next time and maybe sit down as well.
