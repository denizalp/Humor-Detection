I like this place. I'll probably be back. \nI admire their desire to be different, to be adventurous.\n\nBUT Jaburrito has the same problem that sushi restaurants have. The food has no flavor; you have to add flavor....with sauces and add-ons.\n\nLet's be honest here: rice has no flavor. It's like little pieces of styrofoam. \nMost raw fish has no flavor, other than slightly fishy. \nNow combine all that into a flour tortilla (or soy paper etc) which also has no flavor, and guess what: MORE no flavor. \nOh sure, lots of TEXTURE, but flavor has left the building.\nSo slather on the wasabi, the hot sauce etc.\n\nHmmmm. I wonder about this food strategy.\n\nSO to test my thesis: after I ordered my Jaburrito, I drove a few blocks down the street to Mariana's and ordered a typical carnitas burrito. Then I went home, and ate half of each.\n\nGuess which one had more flavor....and therefore more satisfaction?\nAt half the price.
