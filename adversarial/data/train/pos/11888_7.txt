I guess I must've come on the right night because my seafood was as fresh as if I jumped into the ocean with a fishing net and caught the crustaceans myself.\n\nFrom the oysters, to the shrimp, to the sashimi, to the crab legs to everything else...all good. Except for the mini lobster tails which were over-cooked and rubbery but hey, dip that summamabitch in some melted butter and lemon and it's on.\n\nPrior to that, we stopped by one of those \"Half Price\" booths (the one by Ross on the strip) and only paid $28 for our seafood buffet. If you've read my review on Barona's buffet, you'll know I'm here for the seafood and dessert only. I limit my carbs to a minimum at these places as I need to save precious stomach space for the good stuff.\n\nThe shrimp was delicious as were the fresh steamed crab legs. I laughed out loud when the greedy bastard in front of me hogged the not-so-empty tray with a smug smile on his face, only to have them bring out a fresh new tray for me and the folks behind. He had that \"aaaw maan\" look on his face and ran to the back of the line for more since I refused to relinquish the serving tongs. Dude, it's an all-you-can-eat buffet so relax, they'll bring out more. \n\nHubby always laughs at me because I don't \"eat-as-I-go\" but instead create a big pile of of crabmeat as to eat without interruption. The waiter almost took away my plate since I got up to get more lemon, but stopped when I said, \"wait, I just put in about 7 minutes of labor getting that crabmeat out of their shells!\" much to his amusement. \n\nWe finished off our meal with creme brulee, gelato and other confections that were almost too pretty to eat. Afterwards, dance off your gut at Voodoo Lounge. That's only IF you can fit into your clubbing clothes afterwards.\n\nThumbs up.
