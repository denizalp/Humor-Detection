Not sure who you people are that think you are getting some fantastic gourmet food at 5:00 in the morning but try ordering at 9:00 in the evening and you will be surprised :) We were very impressed with the hot wings and my 'authentic' sub was fantastic!!! The Greek salad wasn't amazing but not bad! Overall...order!!! update - we have ordered at least 3 times since starting this review and I have to tell you, it is pretty darn good! Not Spinato's mind you but good food and quick delivery!
