No, this isn't the same as Din Tai Fung in Arcadia, CA.\n\nIt was still however, incredibly memorable. My taste buds were happy for days after this meal. We came for lunch on a Tuesday. The restaurant was packed but we were seated quickly. \n\nService here isn't the best. The employees aren't attentive. You can't really blame them. There are way too many customers and just a couple of employees. They need to hire more employees. Our server looked incredibly overworked. \n\nFree Wi-Fi is available. The password is the restaurants phone number. Complimentary tea is offered. A menu and order sheet is brought to the table. You write down your order on the sheet and give it to an employee. Food comes out fairly quickly. Everything tasted fresh and was very flavorful. \n\nI love their Spicy & Sour Soup. Filled with all sorts of goodies and had a nice kick. There were levels of flavor in this soup that I usually don't taste in most hot and sour soups. Drool. The Green Onion Pancake was crisp, yet soft in the middle. Filled with lots of green onions. An oily but tasty starter. Their Shanghai Wontons w\/ Spicy Sauce was so good that we had to get another order towards the end of our meal. The wontons had a delicate skin filled with tender meat seasoned to perfection. They are placed in a pool of chili oil and topped with green onions. If you enjoy spicy foods, this dish will finish quickly. \n\nTheir XLBs (Xiao Long Bao) are a hit. Whether it be with pork filling or pork and crab, it's juicy and flavorful. The broth inside is clean and seasoned well. The skin is smooth with a nice chew. Dip your XLBs in some vinegar\/ginger sauce and you're good to go. For any shrimp lovers, try the Steamed Shrimps & Pork Siu Mai. Big and beautiful pieces of shrimp. \n\nThough the service needs great improvement, the food is off the hook. Just thinking about Ding Tai Fung makes my mouth water.
