My dude Squirrel eats a LOT of subs so to switch it up we come here from time-to-time.  To me paying 7-9 bux for something that can be made at home for 2 is nuts and kinda damn lazy too but thats how Squirrel gets down.  Staff is fun and the subs look as fresh as lunchmeat can get.  I used to live in Jersey so the maps and diagrams on the wall bring me back to the days of taking the Path train into the city wearing Davey Dukes, tripping on shrooms with Jim and Terry...
