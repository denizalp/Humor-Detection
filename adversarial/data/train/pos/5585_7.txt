What a fantastic way to spend $20!! I had been wanting to check out the Fremont Street Flightlines for a while now, I finally did so last Friday evening.\n\nIt is cheaper to ride before 6 pm ($15 before, $20 after), we wanted the full effect of riding after dark when the light show was going so we got in line right around 7 pm. After about a 10 minute wait we were weighed, signed some waivers and headed up to the 5th floor of the parking garage to get strapped in. \n\nOnce you are actually on the platform you realize you are 60 feet up and about to dangle from some straps as you fly thought the air. It's a little nerve-racking but in a good way. The employees double and triple checked to make sure we were strapped in securely but still comfortable enough to enjoy the ride, told us three common-sense rules for riding, and off we were! \n\nI ended up spinning around a few times which I was trying to avoid but turning yourself back around is really simple. I loved the free feeling you get from the wind on your face... And the sounds of tourists on the street enjoying another exciting evening downtown...  It's a cool combination. \n\nBefore you know it, you are coming to an abrupt stop at the end. This is a quick ride, we spent far more time waiting in line then enjoying the attraction but that's to be expected. Spending $30 on three photos ($20 for the first and then $5 for each additional one) at the end was the most painful part of the experience, but it's not like there was a cheaper way to remember the evening. \n\nOverall, I would do this again in a heartbeat. Highly recommended anyone that visits or lives in Vegas try this at least once.
