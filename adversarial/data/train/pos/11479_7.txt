Ping. Pong. Ping! Pong! PING! PONG! Friends, there is only one table! So while this isn't exactly a \"Ping Pong Club\", more like a \"Ping Pong if you're lucky\/ practice your sharing skills\" it is a welcomed addition to Mile End and the first of its kind that I hope sticks around for a while (or expands). Cocktails are good, most are $10, and there are milkshakes and snacks. The vibes are relaxed super great for a date whether its your first or one of many with your lover. Music spanned MGMT to Beatles to U2 (I know, you couldn't escape him from iTunes and now this... We won't hold it against them this time). Have some fun, get pinging and ponging.
