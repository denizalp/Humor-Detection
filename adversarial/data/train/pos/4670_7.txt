Don't be fooled if you walk in the front doors of Asyans- It will look like you are walking into a cheap, very small store with random every day items and a few items of clothing.  You have to go upstairs where you will find a completely different place.  The second floor has wall to wall \/ floor-to-ceiling fabric and sarees with every design\/material you can think of.  Probably the biggest supplier in the area.  (The third floor is the same but has shalwar's and other 3-pc suits.)  They also have on site tailors and jewelry.  The only downside is the same with any other saree outlet (ie- they might give you a hard time if you're not brown).  Overall they're fairly accomodating (though their english isn't that great).  Prices are average though some of the materials are super expensive.  The first shalwar I got from there had one sleeve that was smaller than the other so I went back the next day and the tailor fixed it in 5 minutes for no extra charge.  Despite the mediocre service, the selection they have is really awesome.
