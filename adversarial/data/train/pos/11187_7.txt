SCAM SCAM SCAM!!!\n\nVISITORS ... RESIDENTS ... ALL of you PEOPLE ... BEEEE AWARE OF THIS ONE ... THEY WILL TRY TO CHARGE U TWICE FOR TIPS!!! What kind of people do that really!!!\n\nI went to this one because one of the nearby restaurants (Middle Eastern) was also closed for renovation.\n\nLet me begin my review with this: \n\n1. They charge you automatically 18% a gratitude tip of the overall amount! It is CLEARLY written in the bill as 18% Gratuity (mine was around 7 dollars). \n\n2. Then the server will bring you another bill to sign with BIG BLANK SPACE With the WORD TIP!!!! AND NOTE: the 18% are already included and they simply want you to add more!! BUT without your attention!!\n\nWhhhhat ... This is the first time everrrrrrrrrrrr in my life I find someone with the courage the do such stupid cheating!!! Do you want me to tip you again!! Do you think people are really stupid not to notice that!!!\n\nI'm a person who tip generously ... I like to tip even when the server is not that good because we all face hard days so don't expect a perfect service each single time you sit in a restaurant. Waitress and servers are human and face greater pressure than us who just came to enjoy a meal and leave. But what happened in this cuisine is really unprecedented! To have the courage to decide the amount of tip I wanna put is mean and malicious, but to send me another bill with tip space (with the total amount already including 18% tip) is PURE THEFT!\n\n\nTo the owner: \n\n1) I hate when you decide in behalf of me how much I should tip your employees. The server was good (may be because the restaurant was really empty), but still this don't give you the right to decide for me!!\n\n2) Your shish taooq is really not tasty! $17 for a small plate of kebob is really OVERPRICED ... I'm a Middle Eastern who live in LA, California and even in fancy places which are located in the most expensive locations like West Hollywood, Beverly Hills, SFV (not in the border of Las Vegas like yours) don't charge $17 for a small  Middle Eastern Plate! I know how much it cost to prepare a high quality plate (I'm into the food business), and yours are totally and ridiculously overpriced. You will have (2 to 4) dollars revenue in a $10 plate (the average cost for a kebab plate made with good and fresh ingredient, not to mention it  includes labor cost and rent as well!). Yours, based on my experience, cost less than 6 (100% sure providing I don't know how much is the rent in the border lines of Las Vegas): Thus, it is completely ridicules to ask for $17 to your plate ...\n\n3) I'm seriously disguised by your trick! I dare you to replay with reasonable answer to this incident without the words: I'm sorry, it was a mistake!!\n\nWhat an Irony: Ali Baba in the Arabic culture was a guy who used to steal people's money, but hey at least we heard he was givin' em' away to the poor!!!
