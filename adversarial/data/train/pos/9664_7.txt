Do I need to say something for this place? It is AWESOME. It always makes me SOooo satisfied every time I go. You won't go wrong with anything - I particularly liked the split lobster - I thought the wood grilled lobster is a little bland compare to the other style. The garlic shrimp is also a must try. Crabs are less mind blowing but still really good.\n\nThe nicest thing about this place is their biscuits - I would always finish one batch and ask for another batch and pack them home and munch on them for the next day. It is super soft. I also love their lava cake - awesome dessert choice, but you gotta have some space in your stomach to finish that big baby. I usually split it between at least 3 people.. \n\nKeep in mind that their drink menu is also very exciting. They also come with giant portions. Don't eat too much of the salad before the entree if you have a marble stomach, otherwise, just sit tight and enjoy the ride!
