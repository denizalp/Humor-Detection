I've waited a long time to give a review. I just don't want to go on a few visits, but I think it's high time. Years in fact. It just gets worse and worse. Did someone say SLIGHTLY higher prices. I said I wouldn't come back again. I came for the orange juice machine and left with the fish mans attitude that the fact I asked him to take the head off the trout makes me common folk. I can't tell if the nasty attitude of the cashiers is from ego or having to eat their nasty prepared foods. I'm trying very hard to put my finger on what it is. Are they throwing every spice imaginable in to make tofu taste good or just trying to be creative on an empanada? Either way everything I've tasted prepared here taste like crap. \nI almost cracked a tooth on one of the coconut macaroon. All the cookies were stale. I threw them out. The bananas lasted 2 days. They were not organic. The prepared Jicama was slimy after 3 days.  I spent over $250. Probably threw out $30. My main purpose after the great orange machine was the bison. At my usual grocery store I usually buy a roast or whatever is on sale and have the butcher grind it. I asked to do that for a bison roast, they refused saying their mgr would not allow them to do that but the ground bison is freshly ground. ( I guess freshly ground is relative). This time they told me it's brought in already ground. Ground where? When? What parts are in there? No answer. Just enough parts to make it 98% fat free. Well. An asshole is pretty much fat free too. Is that in there? I am just getting my own grinder. I just want the truth. Is that too much to ask? I will say, the time before this the fish man deboned and filet my fish. Beautiful. That's what made me come back. I probably will go back after a few months but not for $250. Just the juice, just the juice. Don't go in hungry!
