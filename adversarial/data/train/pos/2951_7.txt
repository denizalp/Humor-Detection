I really don't see why they have so many high praises and ratings. The sandwiches are all very simple, things you could easily put together at home. They are very slow at making each one, seem pretty unorganized and the atmosphere is cramped. \nI got the Italian, it was simply salami, pepperoni, cheese, mayo, lettuce, garlic salt and tomato. Then they had a homemade pesto, which seemed cool, but they put a small bit (not enough for my sandwich)?on my (tacky) styrofoam plate. Why wouldn't you just put it on my sandwich? Plus no option for onions, olives, or other special toppings.\nIn summary, they are SUPER nice, the sandwiches are somewhat cheap, but there is nothing special about the food. It's something all of us could go home and make on our own. Plus it's a real hassle to get your sandwich and eat it in the cramped space. \nSammiches, if your goal is to simply make money off of the patrons that come through the office building you're in due to convenience...I think you nailed it! If you actually want to own your own place sometime and want to be the best, you are really going to need to find something that makes you unique and go with it. Subway is fast and has lots of options, Firehouse steams their sandwiches, Jimmy Johns has better quality meats, bread and is very quick, Bocadillos is a huge portion and a crazy good gourmet offering, WhichWich lets you make whatever you want with tons of ingredients, what does Sammiches do that no one else does? I should be able to walk away knowing what makes you special. Get to work!
