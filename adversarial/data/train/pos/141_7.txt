DONT BELIEVE THE HYPE\n\nOK so the reason I came here was because of all the reviews and honestly this place is not all that. First of all you have to wait for an 40 minutes or more to be seated and the service is very slow.\n\nOnly thing I liked about this place is the hurricane roll (The extra star is for this roll). The fresh was not as fresh as some reviewers said.\n\nOH and because we were sitting thing there and talking with friends with have not seen for awhile, mind you this is shortly after we paid the bill, they asked us if there was anything else we needed kinda their way of telling us to get the eff out because there were people waiting. I am sorry but if we were at any other place, they wouldnt make us feel that way. \n\nThey are never getting my business again. Get a bigger spot!
