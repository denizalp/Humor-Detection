STOLE MY COMPUTER'S PARTS\nSo I have a story for you all. My husband took my Hp laptop to be repaired at this place. He was told that they could call the next day to give us an  estimate and go over the repairs for the computer. I had called the place for three days, started by being told they were behind, later on added other excuses such as short staff so decided to just show up. They told me that the mother board died and there was no repair, in other words it was garbage. \nThey also told me to come back because they needed more time since it was opened and needed to put it together. Came back again and walked away with a dead 3 year old computer. \nWell, guess what? We took it to two different people for second opinion :  the first one was a technician friend of a friend that told us that there were parts missing from my computer. I was shocked. At this point we decided to call and confront them and obviously they denied it all. We really didn't know what parts were taken, we imagined that they could have been replaced if found so we sent it to a relative whos a college student in Mexico, thinking that he could add the parts that were missing. Well, guess what he found when he tried to repair it himself : nothing. So they stole whatever they could re use and those parts will be charged as new to one of your computers. \n\nKarma will get you back! know that you will get what you deserve. Will be pressing charges pretty soon. Good thing I kept my invoice and have cell phone bills proving the several phone calls we made. Shame on you!
