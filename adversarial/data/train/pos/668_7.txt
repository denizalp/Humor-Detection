Very cool tour.  I went here early in the spring last year so it was too cold for the beer garden but I think it would be great in the summer with the live bands...and of course Capital Brewery beer!! Yum!\n\nOn a cool note, our guide said that the warehouse can be rented out for events....I think it would be awesome to have a party in there surrounded by pallets, cases, MOUNTAINS of BEER!! :)
