I regret even having to give this place one star. This was a horrible place to eat. The salad bar was appalling with hardly any salad or food . The food that had been sitting out there was luke warm. But of course we were there for the meat so we waited. After they brought out a few rounds of fatty white\/dark meat chicken they finally brought out a rough beef jerky like slice of beef. That was the last semi-good piece of meat we got. Everything else, round after bloody round was dripping rare. When we complained to the owner after two hours we got no help. We did get an angry Brazilian with a knife come to tell us that we didn't have anything to complain about because we didn't make reservations. (There were three tables with ppl in them). When we were finally done waiting for meat that was edible we had to ask for the check (which was full price by the way). $84 dollars for some ice berg lettuce and a lot of dinner rolls. We were never offered a discount or coupon to come back and we complained at the end too. This was a really really bad experience. Lol, the lady who is commenting can't even take some honest criticism and try to make her place better. This is so professional. Maybe this is why the Italian restaurant of the same name shut down? I never once complained about the price, I have been to a lot better places than this one claims to be. I also consider myself to be pretty patient. All I wanted was some steak, at a steak house, it should not have been this hard haha. Well, for me, this is just one night. Unfortunately for this poor woman, it's her whole life.
