The big review 200.\n\nYou dont go to Vegas pool clubs for a relaxing afternoon with the new Nicholas Sparks novel.  You go to Las Vegas pool clubs:  to galk at scantily clad skanks and their douchebag male counterparts, get shit faced on the most impossibly expensive drinks this side of Dubai, get a tan, and drunkenly splash around whilst wilin' out to pretty horrible pop\/hip-hop\/house.\n\nThats it, and there is no nicer place in Vegas to do just those things. Service is unmatched, the facilities are amazing: it is huge, so big that it doesnt get crowded, and overall was a shockingly good time. A sheer luxury oasis tucked in between Vegas' two nicest hotels.\n\nWe ponied up for a pool side cabana, and the service was impeccably provided by outrageously hot girls with great bikinis. \nThe crowd was friendly, and exactly as douchey as you'd expect. Be prepared to drop at least $2k on a a cabana (but that is just drinks and food, no fee for the actual cabana itself)\n\nIf you want to go to THE Vegas pool party, this is where you want to go.
