Not gonna lie, I decided to try this place out because of an appealing photo I saw on a Las Vegas foodie Instagram account! I ordered the Butterfly Pea Tea with fresh squeezed orange juice. The OJ gave the drink the right amount of sweetness, needless to say that the two make a delicious combination! I wasn't sure about the chia seeds at first, but I actually loved the little bit of texture it gave the drink. I'll have to come back to try the yogurt flavor with the Butterfly Pea tea!
