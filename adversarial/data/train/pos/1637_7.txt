So I found out last week that there is a 8 dollar cover for everyone on Saturday nights.  But wait.  the drinks are only 50 cents.  The well drinks are less to be desired so I stuck to bottles.  And for the first time in 20 times coming here I was not hung over the next morning.  I think it is probably something they put in the ice.  I  would definitely keep an eye on your drinks or watch whoever buys them for you,  know of a couple of people who thought they got drugged.  Another thing is I am married so coming here is like watching the animals at the zoo.  Good times.
