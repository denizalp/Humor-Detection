This is one of those delightful little consignment and resale stores that I find out of town but not often in Phoenix.  The owner, Jeff, says it offers \"eclectic treasures\".  That would be one way of putting it.  Another is that you don't know quite what you might find there and that makes it worth going there and experiencing it.  It is far from fancy and as he doesn't have a high overhead, he can keep the prices down.  I saw antiques to knick knacks to furniture to live plants and that was in only one quick visit to the store this morning.  That to me is the real charm of this store.  Usually you would find it in a more bohemian part of a large city and it is has popped up in Phoenix?\n\nHow did I find out about it?  A friend who works in a high end antique store in the Valley had heard about it from another friend.  She wasn't quite sure of the location but knew it was on the South side of the road, she thought.  She knew it had consignment and resale but that was about it.  \n\nThe is one of those stores that word of mouth is going to help keep open.  I hope Yelp helps to do this.  Digging around for \"treasure's\" doesn't bother me.  It takes be back to a simpler place and time.  There are some framed theatre posters there that are begging me to go back and bring them home tomorrow. Best part is I can afford to think about them bring from this funky store; in another place I am not sure I'd be able to.\n\nSpeaking of prices.  I hesitated to put inexpensive or moderate.  Check it out for yourselves.
