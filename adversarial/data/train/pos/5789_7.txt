A Texan once traveled to Cleveland for BBQ... Sounds like the start to a bad joke right? I guarantee this story has a very happy ending! Before coming to Ohio, a co-worker told me about the newest Michael Symon's joint...Mabel's BBQ. I immediately laughed at her suggestion thinking \"I'll be darned if I go to Ohio for barbeque\". My pride took a backseat once I saw pictures and reviews. The giant beef rib had my name written all over it. Boy did it not disappoint!! It was perfectly marbled, juicy and fell off the bone. The waitress told me of the spicy bbq sauce and the mustard based bbq sauce. The rib did not need sauce but just to satisfy my curiosity, I tried the mustard based sauce. I'm not a fan of mustard but that bbq sauce was quite tasty and not at all tangy as I expected it to be. The one thing I was a bit disappointed in was the rib only came with a slice of bread, sauerkraut and pickles. Overall, I was very pleased with my visit and had zero wait arriving just before 5PM in bar area.
