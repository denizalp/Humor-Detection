Had to give it a star in order to write the review. The store manager is a beast. Doesn't care about the dogs and I say dogs because some of them are almost 6 months old. Absentee owner of course so he doesn't give a damn. The workers are really nice especially Chloe, who definitely knows more than the beast of a manager. The dogs look so hot and exhausted  I don't know how they stay in business. They should be closed down.......
