A lot of weirdos shopping and\/or loitering around the area. Hey, it feels like home when I shop at this sketchy CVS Pharmacy store, which is also walking-distance from my hotel. \n\nThough there isn't much around the area, this 24-hour CVS Pharmacy\/store has everything I needed and then some. There is also a Chase ATM-machine at this location. At least, I know where there is an ATM machine in Phoenix. \n\nDespite being a stranger in Phoenix, the friendly clerks treated me well. I would hate to imagine how they treat the other Phoenix's locals!
