Unassuming cafés are a dime a dozen in Montreal.  Walk a block there's one; walk one more, there's another.  But Café Névé did something right to catch my sister's attention.  She's a brisk, focussed walk-er.  Only she knows how or why she spotted it.\n\nNévé is cute, unpretentious and communal.  The only cringe factor came from the hipsters behind the counter.  A little too much-ster.  \n\nThe coffee was good.  And while I prefer a cappuccino in the afternoon it was a little too pricey for me.  For me, the focus shouldn't be on the coffee anyway.  Névé serves happiness on a sheet pan - cookies and other baked goods.  A simple pan on the counter, next to the register.  \n\nI looked at the pan and the chocolate chip cookie whispered, 'eat me', which probably means I'm stressed out about something.  I don't ever crave sugar or hear voices unless I have a lot going on.\n\nSo I get the cookie.  Two hours later while waiting for dinner reservations, I took a bite of the cookie and I swear I nearly lost my mind.  It was one of the BEST chocolate chip cookies I have ever had.  EVER.  My enthusiasm for this cookie is off-the-charts.\n\nIt was sweet (but not painfully).  It had the nicest burnt caramel like crust on the edges and a soft, chewy (but totally cooked) centre.\n\nThe cookie is that f*cking amazing.
