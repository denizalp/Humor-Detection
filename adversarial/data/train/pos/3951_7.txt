I'm not exactly sure why there is such reviews of this place.  I've been in constant contact with the realtor I'm working with. We were able to get a home to lease that fit our budget at no time at all. The realtor had been nothing but nice & helpful to me throughout the process. He even made efforts during his vacation to answer his phone & meet me at the office the next day during a holiday. Thank you for all that you've done to make it a pleasurable experience.
