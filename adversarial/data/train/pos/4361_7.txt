We came here for pre drink before concert but I wish we hadn't made the decision to come here. This bar is very shady and sketchy, which I didn't expect to see on this part of town. Everyone looked like alcoholics who seemed to be drinking their lives away as usual. And all these men with girth big enough to fit all my textbooks who probably shaved and showered a month ago kept staring at us. Eww. \n\nDrinks were really cheap but that can't justify our experience at this bar. Service wasn't good as our server took so much time to bring our drinks.
