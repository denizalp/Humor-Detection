I took my motorcycle in to have turn signals put on, a new ignition, and to check the wiring. The bike was there for a few days so I decided to call to check the status and get an estimate of the work that I wanted done. I was told 3-5 hours and that the relay should be replaced. He also asked if I had a manual, which I didn't but found one online and emailed it to him. I also gave him 100 dollars for parts. They ended up charging me for 20hrs and 210 for parts for wiring, ignition, rectifier, relay, carb float gaskets, even though I said I didn't want to spend much. They only were going to charge me 450 total as the bike has been there for around 6 months. I tried to pick up the 3 occasions, each time waiting on average an hour for someone to show up after I set up the time. 1st time they didn't have change or an invoice. 2nd time the bike was leaking fuel profusely so it was unridable. 3rd time I finally was going to take the bike regardless of condition. I ended up paying 370 for everything for it after he threatened to sue me, but agreed to 270 additional and gave me 2 weeks to pay the extra or the warranty they offer was void. They also broke the key cover for the gas tank and lost the original key that would fit to get into the gas tank and for the saddle bags, luckily I had a spare.\n\nI would not recommend any business ran by Ray or anyone associated with him. I found him to be very unprofessional. No one actually walked me through what work was done, which appears the bike was not completely rewired as the switches and their wiring were not touch at all. I never even meet in person with Ray and found what he told me and what the mechanic told me usually never matched. I also was not told of what the additional cost of what additional work he thought needed to be done would be. They just went ahead and did it. The mechanic said they hired someone else to work on my bike.\n\nI have uploaded a few photos of the show now.
