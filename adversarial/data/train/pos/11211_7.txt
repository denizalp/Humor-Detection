I blame Yelpers for the best moving experience of my life, having called Warren's Homework under the Yelpian influence. My last move, which took place a year ago, was also an interstate move, was a terrible experience that I was disinclined to repeat, hence the research for a good mover. (Not only did that mover jack me for $1500 over the estimate, but the movers stole a laptop and shattered the contents of two entire boxes, one of Grandma's crystal and one of my children's pottery.)\n\nThe gentleman who did the estimate was true to his word, and there were no hidden expenses, nor any sort of hijacking of my stuff once it was halfway to California. The movers themselves, Joel and Marvin, did an excellent job. They were thorough, professional, and efficient, all with a friendly, helpful manner. Joel hooked up my washer and dryer without my even asking. They were so gentle that not one wine glass was broken. In fact, there was no damage to any of my things.\n\nIf I had to move again, I would definitely call Warren's, and I would ask for the same movers. Thank you, Yelpers, and thank you, Joel and Marvin--and to Warren, for making it all possible.
