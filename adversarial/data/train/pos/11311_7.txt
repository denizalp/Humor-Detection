If i could do a zero star review I would. So about 2 months ago I was in this location and after waiting 30 minutes and a lobby full of people a new client comes in and gets to go in front of everyone that's been waiting. I left a review following that incident and my next visit the Dr. called me back to the office and asked me to change my review because they got in trouble for it and tried to explain why one person's pain is more important than another's. So i change the review and go back in today. Well guess what happened again. I was waiting this time for 20 minutes, I was next up, and a giy walks in, checks in, and gets called back next. Looking thru the reviews there is another client that has had this happeb as well, so its not an isolated incident. This location obviously needs to learn how to take clients in the order they come in. As this location is the closest one to my house I am going to cancel my membership and find a chiropractor that actually cares about the clients.
