It is with great sadness that I am reporting that my most beloved Silver Spoon will be closing their doors after 10 years on the beleaguered Roncesvalles. We dined there on new year's eve and they told us then. The construction that was never ending reduced business by over 40% and it was a tough decision on their part. \n\nI'd like to wish Rocco Agostino the best and thank him for his fantastic cooking. I'm not quite sure where I'm gonna find my crispy duck now. :( \n\nJust an FYI....Rocco is also the owner of Pizza Libretto. I'm hopeful that he will open up another spot similar to Silver Spoon. It was a special spot and it'll be missed. \n\nSilver Spoon RIP. We loved you.
