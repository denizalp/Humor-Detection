Ramen Sora is one of my top Ramen spots! \n\n\nTheir Ramen prices range from $8 - $11. I always get the usual shio (salt) ramen. It's the best one in my opinion,  but then again I have yet to try the miso and shoyu (soy sauce) ramen.  The broth is delicious!  I always end up drinking all of it. The noodles are cooked perfectly. The tamago is great! The yolk is still gooey and the whites absorbed all the good flavors. \n\nThey also have the best chashu! The chasu in the ramen is a great balance of fat and meat. The chashu bowl is bomb! They have two sizes, mini $3 and large $7.  I usually get the mini one since I have ramen too. \n\nOverall, great food and great service.  It's definitely one of the ramen spots that I would recommend to everyone. Remember to stay hydrated! The salt ramen will make you thirsty haha.
