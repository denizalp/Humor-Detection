Lush is luxurious and has a great message!\n\nWhen you walk into a Lush store your eyes can get a little overwhelmed and you might not know where to start. It really doesn't matter where you start because all of these products are really wonderful. They look good, smell incredible & encourage us to take good care of ourselves. \n\nThe bath bombs are divine & there are so many to choose from. The funnest part is to put one into your bath & just watch it dissolve creating a stunning array of colors. \n\nSome products I've tried & highly recommend are - \nCleanser - Ocean Salt (smells like a margarita in the shower) leaves my skin glowing\nBody Butter - Buffy (smells like sweet butter) leaves my skin extra soft\nLip scrub - bubble gum (smells like bubble gum!) leaves my lips extra soft \nFresh face mask - Love Lettuce (smells like lavender & almond butter) my face loves this stuff!\nShower lotion - Ro's Argan body conditioner (smells like fresh roses) my favorite product ever!\n\nThis place has lots of amazing things to choose from and there's plenty of staff waiting to assist you to make sure you get the things that are best for you & your skin type. \n\nThey are against animal testing & won't work with any company that isn't. They recycle & encourage customers to bring in used containers which result is free sample goodies! They make everything fresh and I haven't tried anything that I didn't like. \n\nWe all need to take more relaxing baths, so try a bath bomb & let it do its magic...
