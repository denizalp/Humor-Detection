I had two tires split...yikes!\nI headed to Discount right as they opened and stood in line with a few other people. I had called earlier to make an appointment, which did not make any difference in the order I was helped. It was just first come first served. \n\nThe staff was very friendly and had two new tires on my car in a flash. I was in and out within 20 minutes!!
