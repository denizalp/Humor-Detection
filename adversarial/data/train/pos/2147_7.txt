Every town needs a mall that's on the way down and for the Charlotte area, it's the Plaza Fiesta. I've been away for way too long and I think that in my absence, it's gone over. Though maybe that's just me. They seem to do pretty well with the big play area and the video game area for the kids parties and there are quite a few smaller independent shops with candies from Mexico, dresses that seem focused on a certain population group and hair dressings for same. And a Bass Shoe Outlet Store.
