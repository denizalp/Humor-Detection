I've eaten here before and it's very good. Delicious if overpriced. \n\nI write tonight because I am disappointed in treatment I received from the bartender. I saw they were offering food & drink specials until 10pm on a poster outside, but the bartender shoo'ed me away at 9, claiming they were closed. Bummer and I hate being treated like that.
