Super excited for a new gastropub near me! Vegas needs to get down with gastropubs and open up more. \n\nFirst off, the structure itself is really awesome. From the patio, the decor to the vibes. \nThey have an excellent craft brew selection and the food was excellent. No complaints on that!\n\nThe only thing was service. I really struggled giving this place 4 stars but I had to go with 3 because our waiter was horrible. He was super nice, but he literally never checked on us and kept forgetting our drinks. We kept having to ask other waiters to get them for us. I don't think it was his area, but still, he wasn't busy. We went on a Sunday night at 8 and didn't leave until 10 because it took forever to get anything. That's a huge downer.\n\nFor the beer: I had Dawn of the Red. It was amazing. It's a hoppier amber with fruit notes. It's now one of my favorites. \n\nFood: \nFiery Calamari - very good and fried perfectly. It wasn't spicy at all though.\nShrimp and Grits -  It was super tasty. The grits are more of a grits cake and it has so much in it with a ton of flavor. The sauce was very rich and spicy. \nBeef short rib with parmesan mashed potatoes - it was very good and the au jus gravy was very rich. \nThe NUTELLA COOKIE SANDWICH. I'm going to be 100% honest. I'm not a dessert person. But when I saw this cookie on Yelp, I decided to go here solely for that purpose. And friends, it did NOT disappoint. It was the best cookie and ice cream dessert I've ever had in my life. The cookie was all gooey and soft. So perfect. \n\nOverall - I loved this place. I saw other servers being super tentative to their tables. We just got super unlucky. I would love to go again soon to try out other dishes and other yummy beers.
