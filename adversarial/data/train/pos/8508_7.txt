Stopped here for take out to bring home since I really, really didn't want to cook. I opted for the pulled pork and a half chicken.\n\nThe mac & cheese side was excellent. The cabbage side was excellent. The chicken was nice and moist and very tasty. I thought the pork was okay, my portion had a good flavor but was a bit dry.\n\nThe restaurant is clean and tidy, the kitchen looked well maintained. And the choices at the bar looked great. All told, an \"I'm a fan\" experience.
