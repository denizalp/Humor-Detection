Finally made it here just recently!  First experience with Ethiopian food and we are already contemplating going back the next day haha.  \n\nWe went with an Ethiopian friend of ours which made the experience SO much better because he explained everything in detail, reasons why things are done a certain way and he had a great rapport with the owners and many customers in the place.  We felt like we were on a tour or something..it was great!\n\nWe all shared the vegetarian dish with the beef tibs.  Oohhh the beef...soooo tasty!  Everything was delicious right down to the Amoeba water which is their version of Pellegrino.  Planning to do the raw beef dish next time.
