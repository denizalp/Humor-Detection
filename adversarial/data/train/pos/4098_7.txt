I went in for full highlights, cut, color and style as per the Groupon I bought. I told the girl (Molly) that I was looking for a copper blonde just to darken things up a bit for fall (I have blonde hair). She brought out the book and I picked out a darker copper color with a bit of an Auburn undertone. Instead, 3\/4 of my head is now PINK and the underneath was never touched at all. After washing my hair repeatedly all night trying to get the ridiculous color to fade, I called the school asking them if someone could fix it. I understand that these are students and they're learning, but that I couldn't go around with pink hair. (People at work even asked why my hair was pink, so I know I'm not being paranoid or dramatic.) I also asked why there was an entire section of my hair that had no color at all. She responded that it was the color I chose. Which, I am a 30 year old professional, I ASSURE YOU I did not, in any way, want PINK in my hair, and that students only do a partial highlight. Please then, explain to me why your Groupon clearly states FULL HIGHLIGHT. \n\nShe made zero attempts to reconcile the situation in any way at all. Instead, reiterated that the bleeding of the pink would fade out of the blonde sections in time. What does that have to do with the wrong color in my hair? And telling me that I have the color in my hair that I wanted? Absolutely not. First of all, I chose a dark color, not a light one, and second, NOT PINK. \n\nI've been here before and had my hair colored here before and I was very happy. My issue is not with the student but with the rude instructor. Especially since this is a learning school why wouldn't you ask me to come back to fix what was done? That way your student can learn to make the customer happy instead of walking around looking like a teenager? \n\nBe very careful.  Not because of the students,  but if you're unhappy it's YOUR FAULT.
