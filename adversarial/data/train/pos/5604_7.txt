A Chanel suit-clad solo diner with quality leather planner & multiple Apple products. Jr. Associates celebrating with an extended lunch and their second bottle of wine. A debrief meeting between two guys, one from the \"Montreal hub.\" Our weekday lunch provided insight into the corporate world of Torontonians, apparently the usual clientele at stylish Carisma. I like eating with the natives, even if I don't blend in. \n\nFoods: \n- rosemary olive oil bread: served warm, crunchy bite outside, soft bready inside \n- their special caprese w\/ burrata: every ingredient was quality, ripe tomatoes, amazing EVOO\n- galletto con funghi: I wasn't in the mood to partake in their mouthwatering list of pasta dishes, so I opted for chicken breast with a concentrated mushroom jus & nice root veggies.
