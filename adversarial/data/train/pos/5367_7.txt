Just kind of average .... no surprises \n\nIn the land of ubiquitous sit down chains, Chilis could be considred one of the leaders if not the king. On my visit to Chilis I ordered the queso dip and chicken dippers and my friend ordered the half rack of ribs with dry rub and a side order of barbecue sauce. My chicken dippers were somewhat greasy and the queso dip just didn't taste right .  My friends ribs were tasty but not a lot of meat on them. The waitress replaced the chicken dippers and gave me the spinach dip instead of the queso, and it was good.\n\n The meal was definitely disappointing. The best part of the meal was the service, which was quick and friendly.
