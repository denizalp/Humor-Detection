Lube, Batteries and Lingerie OH MY!\n\nCastle is closer than Fascinations to my house and I find their prices to be the same if not slightly cheaper. \n\nTheir selection is larger in some areas, in others like the 50 shades area it is somewhat lacking.\n\nHands down the best part about stores like this are \nA) The people that work there, usually and as has been my experience here they are chill and knowledgeable about their products.\n\nB) The people who come in and either act shifty...eww get out, or the girls who JUST turned legal and fall all over themselves giggling at the first giant dildo they see. \n\nCertainly give this place a shot who knows it could make your Saturday night awesome (Even if you are alone LOL)
