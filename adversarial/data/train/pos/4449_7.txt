Popped in on the Cacique side, looking for something soft and sexy as a gift for my lovely wife. While I did spot a few nice things, the prices were a lot on the high side. I've signed up for their email specials so perhaps a good coupon will appear and I'll buy a bunch of great stuff!\n\nSales help was unobtrusive and friendly.
