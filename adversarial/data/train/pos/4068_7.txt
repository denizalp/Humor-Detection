I like the space, the roomy seats and aisles and the concepts going on here.\n\nI don't think it has quite jelled yet.\n\nI will say that on a slow Monday night, the few people I was with as well as the other 5 that were in the theater seemed to enjoy the attention.\n\nIf I went on a date without the kids I might enjoy grabbing a drink and relaxing before the show or even having a drink during the show in one of the theaters that allows such things.\n\nI tried out the new concept seating demo that jiggles and sways somewhat in sync with the action on screen...no thanks. I prefer my jiggling and swaying in venues other than a dark theater.
