Not great. The crust is closer to apple pie crust than pizza crust, which I find very un-pizza-like and weird. The ingredients are fresh and tasty but it's like eating stewed tomatoes and hunks of parmigiano cheese thrown together and heated up in a bowl. Also begs the question, is this really pizza? Can't see why it takes them at least half an hour to make except for the strange crust which I really didn't like. FYI the place is an extremely LOUD zoo!
