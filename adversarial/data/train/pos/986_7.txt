Now what is it about Vegas that makes you feel like you're constantly looking at a rear-view mirror? \"Objects in the mirror appear closer than they are.\" Everything's bigger when I'm there, including my appetite once Jamie W. and I settled into a comfortable junior suite at Mandalay Bay. After a long drive and just before Jamie arrived, I was feeling mighty peckish but recognized dining options at a pricey resort are not so inclusive of solitary cheapskates like me. As I strolled among the restaurants and the hostesses in their strapless gowns, I came upon Citizens which turned out to be a slightly upscale 24-hour diner and bar. It's about three years old, so I wasn't familiar with the place.\n\nI took a look at the menu and noticed it was all-American comfort food with Vegas prices. I have to say I was starving since I had not eaten since an early morning breakfast at SFO airport. The $15 Caesar sounded good to me, but I didn't want to use up room in my belly reserved for meat. The server offered a small version for $5, which was frankly quite abundant by itself with plenty of romaine drenched in a lemon garlic dressing topped with a Parmesan crisp (photo: http:\/\/bit.ly\/21GGabO). It wasn't an artful plate but it certainly hit the spot. Now back to the size thing I was alluding to before. I decided to throw caution to the wind and ordered the $36 Citizens Prime Rib Dinner, oh yes, by far the most expensive thing on the menu.\n\nWhat came out was a sizable cut of beef on the rare side but slow roasted apparently for 18 hours. It was satisfying enough with a nice crust though not as juicy or laden with au jus as I was hoping. There was a bit of sour cream on the side though surprisingly no horseradish. I should have asked for it, but the place was starting to hop at that hour. It came with a loaded baked potato heavy with a molten cheddar though the spud itself was a tad on the lukewarm side, while the steamed broccoli turned out to be one chewy stalk that required a sawing motion to get it into digestible portions (photo: http:\/\/bit.ly\/1pnnNuG). I couldn't finish the meat, so I took the rest back to the room where there was serious gnawing throughout the weekend.\n\nFOOD - 3 stars...hits the spot when you're hungry and portions are abundant (consider the prices) but nothing really transcended\nAMBIANCE - 3.5 stars...spacious enough for a resort restaurant\nSERVICE - 3.5 stars...servers buzz around a lot but pay attention when it matters\nTOTAL - 3 stars...definitely a more reasonably priced option anytime you want it at Mandalay Bay
