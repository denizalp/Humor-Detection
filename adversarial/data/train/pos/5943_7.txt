One year for Caribana, I do undecided to splurge on a stay at this classic hotel. This is Queen Elizabeth's official residence when she travels to Canada.\n\nThe hotel is ornate and is full of history, especially the lobby. I enjoyed the spa facilities.  It is in an excellent location for activities on the waterfront.\n\nI stayed in a Fairmont Gold room. These are special rooms special access keycards. The Gold lounge grants special privileges such as access to various newspapers and magazines and email access on complimentary computers.  Throughout the day you can enjoy coffee, tea, an honor bar as well as complimentary cocktail canap√©s.\nThere is also a daily continental breakfast included.\n\nThere is a Business center for more serious computer endeavors. I enjoyed the retail shops and the minor restaurants in the basement lower section.
