Since my original review I have also had the Mediterannean Bean Salad (which is SO FREAKING GOOD), the mashed potato soup, and we tried some raw items on a Friday. The cookies were divine, the almond milk drink Sasha makes is incredibly creamy and delicious, and the peanut spring rolls are very fresh and flavorful. I was not the biggest fan of the \"porcini scallops\" but I don't like mushrooms... other members of the group enjoyed them! \n\nThe actual restaurant is really cute and cozy, and I love the sayings written all over the walls.
