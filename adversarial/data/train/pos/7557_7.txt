I usually love to go to clubs in Vegas. Usually they are comfortable, have a dance floor, and have plenty of heaters outside for people to share. \n\nYesterday, my friends and I went to this club to celebrate a few birthdays, including my own. I could tell none of the employees were prepared for the night. I kept seeing people running out heaters for the people who ordered bottle service which almost ran my friend over. \n\nSo not only were my friends and I FREEZING but there was NO dance floor and we were required to keep walking around a pool to \"keep us moving\" away from the heaters the VIP's were using. \n\nAlthough we were the ones being pushed by arrogant men the bouncer still told us to \"move along\" and did not want to hear us out. \n\nSo after not even an hour of being there my group of 16 friends, pissed, annoyed, and cold decided to leave this \"club\" if you'd even call it that since it had no dance floor.
