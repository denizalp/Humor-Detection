Eeeeeeeeeeeeehhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh.\n\nI was in the Seven Hills\/Anthem area because I was at my parent's house. Knowing that I needed items for dinner tonight, I decided to stop at this Vons instead of another store in my neighborhood. I usually don't do Vons, because they are pricey. But, it was close, and I love their bread that they bake in store.\n\nFirst off, parking lot is packed. I parked far away, to avoid any friction.\n\n I know that this is an older neighborhood, and the elders are not very welcoming...to the younger folks. Or maybe it is just my flaming red hair and tattoos so they thought I was a prostitute or something...\n\nAny person that I said \"I'm going to sneak past you, \" or \"I'm right behind you\" (because they were taking up the whole freaking soup isle) seemed quite annoyed, and unpleasant.\n\nThey see one another (from the senior center I guess...?) and stop....in the middle of isles, and every where else in between to have conversations....long, drawn out, gossip of the day, conversations.\n\nThis made it quite difficult to navigate, and of course, there's always that certain person (who has their head up their ass) on their phone, paying no attention to any body or anything.\n\nWhile cart surfing through the crowd, making sure my daughter doesn't eat anything that she isn't suppose to (like drink stirrers that some ass decided to leave in the cart), I pick up the items that I need.\n\n I thankfully find some organic broth(s) on sale (with card) 2 for $5. I pick up my veggies, canned tomatoes ,dry lentils and sour dough bread. \n\nMight I add, that Vons bakery bread is some of the best that I've ever had.\n\nI love bread.\n\nAnnnnyyyyways, I get to check out and the four lanes that they have open are backed up. And EVERYONE is bitching about it.\n\n Like, O M G, the world is going to end. People are frantically asking their shopping partners if they have 15 items to go to the \"express\" lane. Others are huffing and puffing about how someone else has \"too many\" things.....\n\nSeriously? Shut it gramps.\n\nI treat myself to a Mountain Dew while the employees are paging over and over again for help to the front. \n\nThe man in front of me is having trouble using the debit card machine. Instead of helping him, the employee just waits for him to figure it out on his own..... How sweet.\n\nI spent almost $30 on broth, a loaf of bread, (loose & cheaper than the packaged ones) veggies,a bag of lentils, canned tomatoes, and a mountain dew.\n\n I feel like I was robbed.\n\nNext time, I'll just keep driving.....and pray that I turn out to be a fun, badass, nice grandma one day.
