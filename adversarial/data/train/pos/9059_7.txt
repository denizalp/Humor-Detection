I have always liked the food there.better quality  than taco hell the issue is with the terrible service I got in the drive through. es.they have 99 cent tacos.which is the only reason I stopped there on a tuesday.I was greeted rudely\n  Literally ya I'll b w u in a min.int a rude tone.it   this was at 1150 pm.well after sitting in silence for 10 15  mins.I was deemed worthy to place my order,4 tacos.when I pulled up to pay,the charged me full price!so I said its \"taco tues.\" 99 cents a piece.to which the rude snot face teen said in a condenscending tone\"uhhh todays wed.which made me question if I had my days wrong.after thinking n checking calendar I realized  it had been wed.for all of 10 minutes.and I had tried to place my order at 1150  but was left waiting to order for 15 mins.when I explained this to worker,he could care less and shrugged.very unprofessional.so I paid  full price for something that should've been half the pice. I wanted to complain to manager but was  in a hurry the douche working there is a lil punk.I suspect he made me wait just so he can act like a douche.(on  a power  trip).I work in a restaraunt n the rule is if you're ready to order,the time u pull up should be counted.not the long time it took to be acknowledged. I will never go here again.I don't need rude service.
