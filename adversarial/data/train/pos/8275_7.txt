Needed to get an e-check and stopped here on my lunch break. I work around the corner so thought I could stop in quickly. I pulled up and there was another car in the garage. They told me to pull up behind them and it would be 5 minutes. Sat there and waited 15 minutes and they never acknowledged me. Another car pulled in during that time and they let them pull into the empty garage spot and started looking under their hood. How rude that I'm sitting there waiting and they completely ignore me. Awful service. I was over it and just left.
