I must be REALLY picky, because after reading the glowing reviews I thought this place would've been a lot better. It's true that its located in a seedy hotel in the N.E. just off 16th ave. adjacent to Vista Heights. It's true the decor isn't great. It's true the food isn't bad, but let me elaborate.\n I ordered the Pineapple fried rice, and the rice was a little soggy the beef a little chewy. I'm not sure if it's supposed to be like Chinese fried rice,  they use day old rice. The spring rolls were tasty, about three quarters of the size of Vietnamese ones. The spring rolls which came 4 to an order were crispy, hot and fresh. The yellow curry pork was really tasty as well. It came with a good amount of pork, potatoes, etc. The curry was also good to eat with coconut rice as well.\n On to the restaurant itself. It's small, they only take cash, its in a dumpy motel, the setting is more cafeteria like. The chairs aren't really great, and the table cloths are vinyl. I found the table cloths sticky.\n In conclusion, if you want okay Thai food then try this place out. If you are picky of your surroundings, then stay away. Otherwise try it once, just so you can say you've been there.  If you do want Thai food in a nicer setting, I would recommend The King and I.   It feels much cleaner inside.
