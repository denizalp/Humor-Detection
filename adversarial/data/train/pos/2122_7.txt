My father and I walked in and we were the only customers there.  We were seated, placed our drink and food order.  A couple walked in and said they were just going to look at the menu at the bar.  After a few minutes they decided to be seated, ordered and received their food as dad and I still sat waiting for our food.  The heavy set gentleman asked if we wanted our coffee and Soda refilled as I declined.  We will no longer return as all our previous visits were very nice and prompt.  We didn't even get our bread prior to being served our meals like previous visits we were served bread and some delicious spread when we got our drinks.  Today we received 4 pieces of bread with frozen butter.  No thanks, we will take our business to another local eatery.
