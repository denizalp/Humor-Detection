Stay far far far away, I regret the fact I had ever moved in here.  If you enjoy the extreme summer heat, and you do not believe in showers then this is the spot for you.  Yeah free ac sounds nice, but since it work every 3 days of course it's free.  Showers? Why would you need to shower when you live in a sauna? The water is turned off every other week.  You are welcome to use your tears to wash your face and drench yourselves with sweat.The amenities sounded nice in the start, but the building is just wayyy too old, and the management company is too cheap to update anything here.  If you were sitting in the leasing office enjoying the nice ac, trust me that's the only place that has ac.  Because the rest of us are all having a heat stroke and using Phoenix children's hospital's ac.\n\nMy shrink told me I moved into such a place bc I hate myself....probably bc I didn't get enuff hugs as a child.\n\nBtw if you have a pet, you might as well leave them in the car, bc your car probably has  better ac than your actual apartment.  And it's illegal to leave your pet in your car!
