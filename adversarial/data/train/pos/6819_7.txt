After an extra wait for my table to be set up (even though I had a RSVP) I must say I really enjoyed Cleo.  The flavorful food and attentive service really made it up.  \n\nCleo is a tapas style restaurant.  All the dishes are in small portions, yet sharable.  If you have an appetite, make sure to order more than plate!  But here's a tip, order a few plates at a time to keep the food hot and fresh.  The dishes come out pretty quick, so don't worry about not having food on the table.\n\nWhat's awesome is the oven they have that pumps out hot fresh breads.  To start, I really recommend the Hummus.  I tried many of the dishes and all of them were superb!  I would also say the pork belly and the kebabs are all worth trying. \n\nOn a busy wknd, make sure to have reservations!
