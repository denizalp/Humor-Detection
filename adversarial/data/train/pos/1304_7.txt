I had a flawless experience, through 3 visits. The third visit they even remembered me by name (and my name is neither common nor easy to remember). \nThey did what they promised to, called when they said they would, and kept things simple. \nIn the end I bought a used computer to replace my non working one: I plugged it in and everything was there: all my files, my bookmarks, even my desktop background. \nI'm sold. I won't be going anywhere else.
