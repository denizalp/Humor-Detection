Great restaurant.. tons of varieties.. sushi is good, love the spicy salmon and tuna.. best yellow Malaysian curry I have ever had hands down. . The mandu are so addictive you can`t eat just one and the smoothies are sooooo good.. they also have a great special menu where about 10 dishes are $10.88.. how can you go wrong
