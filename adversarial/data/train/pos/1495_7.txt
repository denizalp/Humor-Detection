When it's 115Â°F and gross out, shaved ice cream sounds awesome and it's excellent here. While you can customize your shaved ice cream with 10 flavor choices including black sesame and taro, 25 toppings, and 4 sauces, they have 10 yummy predetermined combos to which you can add more toppings. Service was excellent.\n\nI ordered a small (16 oz., large 24 oz., monster 32 oz.) Smooth Green Tea which had green tea snow, red beans, and \"snowflake (sugar-based) sauce\" with extra toppings of pineapple and rainbow sprinkles - amazing!!! I was surprised by the strength of the smoky green tea flavor and how it was so filling. Prices seemed pretty fair at a total of about $5 ($4 base combo + 2 50-cent toppings).
