+VIP entrance is always worth 1 star.\r\n+Attractive white interior.  Minimalist vibe, sexy lighting.\r\n+Mildly famous people milling about, but no one worth getting the panties in a bunch.\r\n+Good music -- half the time.\r\n+Who doesn't love a good Pussycat Doll?  Heck, I hope to be one someday.\r\n\r\n\r\n- You cannot sit down here.  Or there.  Or anywhere.  And if you do, a bouncer, all in black, wired in to the matrix on a headset will find you and make you stand up.\r\n- Unless you are VIP, there is absolutely no where to relax.  And if you know Vegas, then you know your shoes hurt like hell.\r\n- Do not take your shoes off.  They will find you, and yell at you.  We spent half of our night f'ing with the bouncers, by removing one shoe and waiting for them to find us in the crowd.
