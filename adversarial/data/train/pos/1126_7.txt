I went here before I decided to go to Mexico and have work done. The dentist was nice. The staff was great. Even with insurance, it was pricy. My insurance said that they were a provider, however their billing department told me they weren't. I couldn't afford the work they quoted me, so I had to sit with pain for 2 more weeks before I could head to Mexico. \n\nThe bonus was if I wanted to pay them that day, and deal with insurance on my own, they would have done the work same day. (2 teeth pulled and 2 posts \/ crowns). They took X-rays and gave me a plan, I knew my dental issues ahead of time, and they didn't want to do the work I asked for. Which is fine, as I headed down the border and had the work done there. \n\nOn a side note, what would have cost me close to $30,000 here in the good old USA with dental insurance cost me $2900 total in Mexico.
