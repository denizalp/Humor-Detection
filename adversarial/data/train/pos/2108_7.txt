The Velvet Tango Room is a Cleveland institution.  Everyone seems to regard it as the pinnacle of local cocktaileries.\n\nI'll admit, I've been there once.  I took out of town friends to experience its greatness,  or maybe its pretentiousness...  We weren't as dressed up as we should have been, I get it. It was at the end of a long touristy day that just ended there. The space is nice and the service was fine after she looked us up and down. \n\nI thought my Manhattan tasted like straight up vermouth. And then the bill came.  $18.  Now I'm willing to pay that for a world class cocktail but damn.  There are many more notable, more polished places where you can get an amazing cocktail for less.\n\nThen, after we paid we were taken through a door next to some cleaning supplies and saw the secret reservation room.  I don't think I'd even want to sit back there.  I sure-as-hell don't want to putt on a putting green back there. \n\nMaybe if I had my first drink of that night and not the last it would have been different.  It rubbed us all the wrong way though.  I'm sure I'll check it out again and let you know.
