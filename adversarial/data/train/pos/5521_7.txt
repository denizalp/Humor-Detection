Holy cow! And I'm only saying, because they will filter out the word s*** !!!\n\nHave you ever wondered why Uber & Lyft are so popular?  Because of companies like discount cab! So tonight I'm driving down Camelback Rd near 22nd St and I get passed by a green \"safe clean and friendly\" discount cab that was doing about 70 miles an hour in a 35 mile per hour zone! The taxi was swerving in and out of traffic. ..I know he was going 70 miles an hour because I caught up next to him to get his taxi #...his taxi cab number was 1186.\n\nSo I did what any other respectful person would do, I called the number on the side of the cab 602-200-2000 and no one ever answer the phone. I called back and I both times I waited about 5 minutes and both times nobody ever answer the phone.\n\nThis company SUCKS  (that's bad, btw)... they speed, they cut people off, and they are reckless.  Don't ride with Discount Cab.
