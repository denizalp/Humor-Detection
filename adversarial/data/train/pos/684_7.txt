Close by from work, you'll find me here occasionally killing time with the rush hour traffic outside bumper to bumper. Know why? Samples! Staff here are friendly, store seems neat to me especially the clothing area. Doesn't look like a \"hurricane blew in here\" like the previous reviewer stated. \n\nGrabbed a pair of charcol grey Calvin Klein 5 pocket pants for $26, super comfy and an unbelievable deal! \n\nOkay now back to the samples, I'm slightly hungry as I'm typing this. Go before 5 and all the tables are up, from perogies to soup, salad, expensive cheese, granola bars, cake, hummus, etc. Small meal before I head on home, don't forget to go twice. \n\nWhy is everyone complianing about parking? Welcome to the GTA guys, our population is growing, it's only gonna get worse. Parking complaints are pointless guys, I find it the same at every location. Park far, less hassles and enjoy the walk. A little exercise doesn't hurt anyone.
