We walked in today to grab a quick bite before closing and were surprised to find such a tiny but complete market right next to noodles and co. We had to go straight for the grill since they were about to clean it. I got the heirloom BELT sandwich for $7.99 while the bf got the chicken sandwich for $6.99. We also walked around and grabbed the little containers of deli sides which were priced $1-3. The cilantro jalape√±o pasta salad was creamy and reminiscent of Cabo fish taco's avocado pasta salad. We also grabbed the basil potato salad and the lemon orzo. \n\nEarl's has a has a cool selection of craft beer and ice cream. I have to admit, $12 for a pint of ice cream is a little crazy tho. My favorite items included the hot fried or rotisserie chicken plates with white BBQ sauce. Had to grab a salted caramel blondie from their little coffee house at $3. Not bad for the size. \n\nThings can get pricey but everything is so unique it's worth it. It's just so fun to look around and pick out cool items.
