This was my first meal in Tempe ad they set the bar high. It was actually my second time at a Gordon Biersch location and I will say that this location is the better of the two. The location is super convenient, on the corner. It is upstairs. They have an elevator though. \n\nThe hostess allowed us to sit anywhere and we chose to sit at a table near the outdoor patio area. It was a bit too hot to sit outside, but I would say if the temperature is down, the outside dining area is probably the best dining view in the city. \n\nI started with the Asian Chicken Bites which were crispy chicken bites tossed in an excellent Hawaiian teriyaki sauce with chiles, green onions and sesame seeds. The sweet lemon glaze was drizzled on the side of the plate, which was a bit odd, especially since we were sharing the starter. For my meal, I ordered the seafood cobb salad. It came with a hefty portion of shrimp and shredded crab, tomatoes, avocado, hard-boiled eggs, cucumbers, bacon, cheddar and pepper jack cheeses. It was excellent and an overall above average portion. My friend ordered the salmon and was disappointed. We cracked up over the weird service. Our server admitted that he's OCD and kept stopping by our table, finally after three times of him asking if he could take away the chicken bites, I said: \"take them\".\n\nOverall the food was excellent but the service was weird. My friend insisted that I'd called and told them that I was on the YES. No, we don't roll like that. But, I have to say service was strange and even the manager was a bit extra, even offering us free dessert.
