I prefer other spas to this one:\n\n*SUPER small\n*Loud staff who have side conversations with eo, not relaxing\n*Didn't love the HAMMAM, the massage was minimal, less than 3 minutes, not a comfortable experience laying on the marble and my body did not feel as smooth as I would have liked\n*The therapist for the Stressbuster treatment was not the most gentle, her technique flawed\n*A lot of windows overlooking the Strip, again, not very relaxing, I could HEAR the Strip noise from chair\n*With the prices charged, they should be brewing tea to order, the peppermint tea in warmers doesn't cut it people\n\nThe shining moment of the day: LOVED the replenishing foot spa treatment, SO relaxing, I fell asleep and my feet were rejuvenated.
