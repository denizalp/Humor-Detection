Cute accessories for really great prices. I love big colorful jewelry and to be honest, I'm not great at taking care of my jewelry. I've lost my fair share of expensive pieces, so I tend to like to save my money for more practical things in life (like food, j\/k). I'll spend good money on a quality piece of jewelry but for more trendy items, I'm all for cheaper is better. The best part about this store is that despite all the jewelry and accessories being reasonably priced, they don't necessarily look cheap. This works for me! \n\nEvery color you can think of is represented in this store in every style imaginable. Trendy stuff galore. I'll definitely be making this a regular addition to my discount shopping routine.
