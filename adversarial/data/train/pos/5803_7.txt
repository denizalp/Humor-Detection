I've been to this place a couple of times and food was GREAT and so was the service, but last week...BAD, BAD, BAD...and would never go back again.\n\nFirst of all, any of you been to this place, the tables are very close together.  So, after we were seated and ordered our food, another couple sat next to us.  Well, there was a guy talking to the other couple next for about 15-20 mins at a time, well he scooted between the tables and his BUTT was literally next to our appetizer, wine glass, and face.  He was so rude.  Not once he realize what he was doing, we scooted the table away from him, it just gave him more room to scoot towards us.  We kept moving it 'til it was joining the other table.  It was gross, completely ruining our evening.\n\nTo top things off, the lasagna was cold in the middle and really lacked flavor, so was the blackened salmon dish.  We did have a pretty good glass of wine, no question about that.  That was the only good thing out of that place.\n\nAfter our meal, we mentioned it to the waitress, and she said the guy we were referring to was the owner.  You would think the owner would have been more courteous  towards his customers, but hey he's the owner.  If that's the way he wants to run his restaurant, then we are definitely not going back.\n\nIf you like the owner's BUTT in your face or the smell of BUTT, this is absolutely the best place to go all day long and would highly recommend it.  If this is your preference, please change my 1 star to 5 stars.
