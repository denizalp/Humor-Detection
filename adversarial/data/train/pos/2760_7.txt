Been here a few time and I'm sorry but I'm not a fan.\n\nThe first time I came I waited for awhile at the bar and no one came out. \nI ordered a Thai Tea and and macaroons:\nThe macaroons were the size of a quarter and tasted stale. At $3.50 each guess I expected more.\nThe Thai Tea was made with a non dairy powder...but it kinda looked like a container of Coffemate which yes still has dairy in it. Now I can't confirm but it was a tan short plastic canister, red top, red ring around top.\nNot sure but part of the boba was hard as a rock and I had to spit part of them out. I gave up after awhile and tossed the whole thing.\nThe girl seemed nice enough.\n\nThe second time I came hubs wanted fried food. Ugh. We got there right at 6pm and the doors were locked. The man eventually opened the door and seemed frazzled. \nWe had to ask for water and had to try to find him to order. Zero gals in sight. \nWe went and we ordered popcorn chicken (they were out), chicken sando, chicken wrap, and nachos. We had to tell him several times what we ordered. \n\nWaited awhile and our waters came and then a gal (same one I encountered on the first visit) came in to work. After a little bit she brought us our nachos and after that our food. \n\nNachos: missing the sour cream but still a big mess. Black beans rinsed out of a can, raw side of jalape√±os, melted cheddar Daiya and EXTREMELY salty and stale chips. There was sooooo much guacamole it was embarrassing. I knew I wasn't going to eat the other food so basically I was going to leave hungry.\n\nThe chicken sandwich was kinda like a Boca, with a lot of mayo, white iceberg and overly fried hard fries. Bleh. \n\nThe chicken wrap was not cut in half so it looked like a giant burrito. Hard to eat and falling apart it was packed, I mean packed, with guacamole. The tater tots were horrible. \nThey were soooooooo over-fried the inside of them were clear. As in the potato tot disintegrated when I tried to bite into one. It turned into a pile of grease and dripped down my arm. \nWe left sooo much food she came out and asked if we wanted to go boxes. Nope. \nThe service by the young lady again was nice enough. \n\nI know my husband won't go back here but I will try to go back and get a different drink sometime. We both had very bad stomach aches when we came home. \n\nUnless they make a total turn around on the quality and menu I'll pass on coming here for food.\n\nDisappointing because it could be sooo much better.
