This place wins out for taste, consistency, and value! A hearty, filling meal for $7?! It's unheard of -- you would pay more at most fast food\/self-catering places. \n\nThe menu is small and you come here for the soon (soft tofu stew). I usually get the beef one or the vegetarian one (comes with nice pieces of broccoli and zucchini), which comes with a nice selection of banchan (bean sprouts in a sesame oil sauce is my fave) and purple rice. You can select your spiciness level from white (no spice) to extra spicy. They also have bibimbap, but I've never tried it here. \n\nThe service is efficient and fast from taking your order, bringing out plates, and paying at the front desk. I always come here when I'm in the mood for something quick and satisfying in Koreatown.
