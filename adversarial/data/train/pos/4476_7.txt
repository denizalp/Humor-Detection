First off, I have to tell you that I'm Indian, so I'm probably going to be a little more critical of this place than most others.  I paid $15 for the vegetarian thali, which was pretty expensive for food that comes in a Styrofoam plate from a restaurant in a food court.  The food at this restaurant is the kind of stuff that they probably cook once a day all in one batch, and then serve throughout the day.  Unfortunately, if you go there at 2 AM like I did, the food they serve you might be a little stale from sitting out all day.  \nI've eaten here twice because I feel sorry for these people who don't seem to get very many customers, but I don't think I'll eat here again.  The food just isn't good, and the prices are way too high.
