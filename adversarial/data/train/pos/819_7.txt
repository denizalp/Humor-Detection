Perhaps I'm the only one who feels this way, but I don't think a business has the right to ask you for EVERY bit of your information just to give them your business. I walked in and they asked me to fill out a waver, which required me to give them ALL my information. I turned around and walked out wondering what could be done with all this personal information about myself. My daughter was a tad disappointed, but we went elsewhere that didn't require a complete dossier of me and my family.
