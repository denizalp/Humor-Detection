Came here specifically for Kimchi and bought 2 jars. They are homemade and taste like it. Not much of a selection being late on a Sunday afternoon. Business was bustling and many customers stocking up with Asian staples for the week. Friendly owners and workers too. No language barriers. It's a stand alone place and is kinda small but ample parking in the mostly dirt parking lot. Not the best Kimchi I've had but it will do in a pinch.
