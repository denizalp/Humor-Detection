Hey C-Street. I was really looking forward to hearing Alexander spin some spooky music last night. I was there for a number of hours during his posted set times and heard nothing that I wouldn't expect to hear on top 40 radio. Alex kept saying he hoped to get back on the decks but it didn't happen while I was there.\nI paid money to enter last night for one reason only, I wanted to hear the music I enjoy. I bought numerous drinks to support the bar, I even bought some jello shots despite my better judgement. I know how this is supposed to work! I spent years working at goth\/industrial clubs in the Bay Area, a friend runs the longest continually operating goth\/industrial club in the United States, our community used to have a vibrant scene in town and I think it could again but not if venues bump 'our' night for frat parties and pull stunts like last night's.
