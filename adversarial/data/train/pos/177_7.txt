Go with a dirty car - leave with a dirty car!!!! :)\n\nAttention to detail of the employees rivals that of a toddler on his third Red Bull of the day:\n\nIf the lower half of your vehicle arrives at the car wash dirty, it will leave dirty.  This is true when you pay extra for a hand wash....you read that correctly car people- hand wash costs more with less clean.\n\nStepping on a Lego, while barefoot, is a better experience than these peeps.\n\nAdding a star - car was clean after the non hand wash.  3 of 4 tires had tire dressing - victory!
