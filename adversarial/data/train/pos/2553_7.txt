A serious step above the typical airport food. The breakfast and lunch options are more than basic and there are plenty of options with fresh vegetables and fruit.\n\nOn the way to the register are prepared foods such as sandwiches, salads, and baked goodies. The salads were really nice salads with good toppings, not crummy iceberg trying to pass for salad. The overhead menu offers the hot options that can be ordered.\n\nMy husband and I both ordered Ultimate Bacon & Egg Sandwiches. It was a nice sized sandwich. The ingredients were fresh and the sandwich overall was tasty. I also ordered a Rice Krispy that had chocolate drizzle on top. That was really good and also a large portion. Our orders came out quickly even though they were very busy. A travel must!
