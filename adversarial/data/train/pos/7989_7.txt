I crave chow mein and fried rice as much as the next pregnant woman. So for this to open up near me has been super dangerous. And there's a DRIVE-THRU?!?!?!??!??!!!??? So I can get my fill without ever having to step out of my car into the million degree weather? Score!!!!!!\n\nOf course their signature orange chicken is a must have. I'll order the beef broccoli for the fact that I'm getting some vegetables, but I'm not a fan of how chewy the beef is. The majority of my visits have been during the lunch hours, so food has been fresh and hot. However, we did go inside on a Saturday evening and the food looked like it had been sitting there for a bit. \n\nEmployees are friendly and fast to fulfill your order. The dining room is large, modern and most importantly clean. Really wish they offered half stars and I could give 3.5. Alas, til that day comes, I'll just settle for a 3. But I'll definitely be back for my chow mein and fried rice needs.
