I haven't actually been inside this place, so the review is just for the food which is always delivered via Grubhub. So far we've had the Philly, chicken fingers, and the Johnny Vegas fries. My favorite thing is the Philly cheesesteak. It's served on a soft roll, with a generous portion of meat and melty cheese stuffed to the brim, then it's topped with green peppers and onions. Try it, you won't be disappointed! \n\nThe sandwich comes with a side of Philly mayo that is deelicious. I love my sauces and this one is perfect! Speaking of sauces, the ranch is homemade so bonus points for that. They also offer a bunch of sauces for the chicken fingers, so I got them plain so I could dip. Hi, my name is Jamie and I have a dipping problem. Honey Sriracha, hot bbq and garlic parm were the ones I tried. Honey Sriracha def has a kick to it. The garlic parm was weird because I didn't see or taste any parm? The hot bbq was my fav for sure. \n\nThe Johnny Vegas fries were good, but how can you go wrong with bacon, cheese and garlic mayo? They have other specialty fries too like chicken ranch and bbq chicken - yum! Last time we ordered, I got a call from the restaurant explaining that they were really busy and the order would be a little late. Because of this they offered to throw in a free 2 liter or piece of cheesecake which I thought was really nice. We chose the white chocolate raspberry cheesecake and it was damn good. That to me really made me like this place that much more.
