The sticker on the door reads \"Yelp loves us.\" Alas, this yelper does not love you. Actually, he's pretty pissed off. \n\nIt was the service and the asinine policies that plunge this into one-star territory, but I'll start with the food: it was a solid three star experience, no more no less. Appetizers consist of spring rolls and fairly bland, if not entirely unsatisfying, fried things. There were several soups that sounded good but that only came in a serving for two. I've seen this at other Asian restaurants and I don't get it. If you can make two bowls, why can't you make one? (If you read on, you'll see that \"We could but we won't\" is kind of their motto.\n\nAll the appetizers we ordered were, I thought, a very good value proposition, even if they were nothing to write home about. We (a party of four) got one order of spring rolls (fresh, crisp, and tasty), one order of crab Rangoon (an above average rendition of a dish that I'm not a huge fan of) and one order of curry puffs, which were described as being like a potato samosa, which they were, but with a bit more fried crust and a bit less potato than I would have liked. Portions of all appetizers were good, prices were reasonable, and the flavor was ok. \n\nThen we got our entrees. I had a garlic shrimp dish that I ordered at a 3 on their four star spiciness scale. It wasn't as spicy as I expected, and the plate was dominated by broccoli, but it's something I could see eating again. The couple that was with us ordered a mango curry that I really liked, but that was a good bit hotter than my 3-star spicy shrimp, even though they ordered it at 1 star. My friend got a 1-star dish that consisted of a small amount of several proteins and a lot of bland vegetables. Nothing was particularly great, but I wouldn't say that I was dissatisfied with the meal. \n\nAfter dinner my friend stepped out for a cigarette, and I went to keep him company. When we got back, the couple had received their check. Then my friend and I were given a check for the combined total of our meals. We asked them to please split it and were told: \"We can't do that. We already split it once, and we cannot split a check more than once.\" \n\nI've never heard of or encountered this policy anywhere else, but apparently that's how they roll over at Lao-Laan Xang. They repeatedly said \"we can't do that.\"  Yes, you can. Other businesses do it. You choose not to to save a few bucks. This is an idiotic, obnoxious policy, but I'd probably still be writing a 2-star review if it weren't for the interaction I had with the waiter as we were leaving.\n\nI politely and quietly said to him, \"It's not your fault, but could you please tell the owner that this policy cost them my business. I live in the neighborhood and order a lot of takeout, but I don't think I'll be back. He's lost my business.\"\n\nHere's how this conversation could and should have gone:\n\nWaiter: I'm very sorry to hear that. I'll relay your concerns.\"\nMe: Thanks. Have a nice night. \n\nHere's how it went:\nMe: ... could you please tell him that he's lost my business. \nWaiter: ACTUALLY, this restaurant isn't owned by a man. \nMe: Oh, then can you let HER know. \nWaiter: ACTUALLY, it's owned by two women. \nMe: I don't really care who owns it. Just tell them that they've lost my business.\nWaiter: Do you understand why we can't do it? It costs us a lot of money. \nMe: I'm sure you have a lot of expenses. I'm sure it's expensive to rent this building...\nWaiter [interrupts]: ACTUALLY we own the building. \nMe: Again, I don't really care... I'm sure you pay for other things. \nHim: It feels like you're personally attacking me!\nMe: Ok, whatever. \n\nHey, guy: when I ask you to pass on my feedback as a customer to your boss, that's not a personal attack. A personal attack would be if I told you that you were a lousy waiter who is incapable of enforcing a stupid penny-pinching screw the customer policy without affecting an air of righteous indignation at the customer. \n\nThis is the first time in at least 5 years that I've tipped less than 18%. And I'll say it again: I won't be going back.
