Got a great coupon book from the Southpoint so decided to check this place out since we had $30 in free play..which we primarily used for dinner.  Buy one entree, get one free.\n\nThe setup primarily felt like something straight outta the 50s.  The music was also primarily weird.  It was like someone hit the demo button on a Casio keyboard or something.  \n\nWaitress was nice.  My wife got the Southpoint cut and I got the blackend\/Cajun cut.  Both cuts were better than buffet cuts..leaner and thicker but I preferred her cut over mine..primarily due to the blahness of the spice\/flavor on the cajun cut.  I ended up scraping off the spice off my cut.  Our entrees came with salad which consisted primarily of lettuce and a side.  My wife got the rice pilaf which wasn't very good and I got a dry baked potato.  We were too full for dessert primarily due to the serving portion of the prime rib.  \n\nI also overheard a guy at another table complaining about the dryness of his chicken.  Not sure why he would opt for chicken at a place that primarily serves prime rib.  \n\nDecent meal for the price but I think the Orleans buffet would be a better pick, especially w\/o a coupon.
