Heads up: the Venetian has Bouchon BAKERY (a small pastry and coffee counter) as well as Bouchon BISTRO (separate listing for dine-in brunch, lunch, and dinner). Apparently there was some mix up about that because reviews for both businesses frequently show up on one another's pages, and now Yelp HQ has handled this by closing the old bakery page and opening a new one. \n ¯\\_(ツ)_\/¯ \n\nI'm somewhat surprised this business still has the Bouchon name on it- the quality is nowhere near what you receive at the bistro, despite a few shared items, nor is the quality. The TKO (Keller's version of the Oreo) is a fantastic sugarbomb, and the macarons are larger than most other places have them, but stick to the seasonal flavors and go earlier in the day. Cookie sandwiches here MUST be split between at least two people, they're large and delicious but probably pack over a day's worth of calories. As for their delicious epi bread? It's better when accompanied by a delicious dinner at the full restaurant. The chocolate bouchons are also better had there.\n\nThe service here is notoriously awful. I don't know if they're going for a detached snobby French aesthetic, but every cashier I've ever had the displeasure of working with here has had an attitude and a scowl. It's a simple job and it's in the service industry, how hard is it to make your face NOT look like you are on Death Row? The fact that the receipts here automatically print out a tip line is hysterical, I've received better service from an ATM.
