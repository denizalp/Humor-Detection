Was excited to eat here, and the food wasn't  bad. But the service was abysmal. \n\nTo start with they try to do that overly precious seating concept where they hand out name tags for you to wear while you wait for a table. The name tags are all Ohio counties, playing off their \"local food\" gimmick. \n\nWell the staff apparently gave out the same name tag a few times, because when they called our county name, two other couples came up to try to get the same table. Awkward. \n\nThe whole vibe was very clich√©d. They have that whole lightbulb pendant chandelier thing going on. Yawn. \n\nOur waitress was unpleasant and gave the impression she couldn't believe she was working on a Saturday night. \n\nThe cherry on top (or lack thereof) was dessert. I ordered the brownie sundae and I was served a milkshake instead. I didn't bother to complain because I didn't feel like encountering the wrath of The Sourpuss as we nicknamed the waitress. \n\nInstead I left the shake untouched on the table, and a nasty review on Yelp. That's how passive aggressive people make a statement. Take that Sourpuss.
