Green Planet installed my pool and landscaping 5 years ago. My family and I love spending time outside. They did an amazing job with the design and construction. I had a problem with my grill recently and I called their office to see if they could help. They were kind and courteous on the phone and help me ordering a new part for my barbecue. Thanks Green Planet Landscaping again!!!
