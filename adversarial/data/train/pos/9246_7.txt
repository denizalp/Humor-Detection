I've only been here once. It was a slight disappointment. It seemed more like an authentic Japanese restaurant to me so I felt like I had to look up a majority of the menu items. I ordered the teriyaki chicken to avoid not knowing what was on my plate.\nIt was just okay. Maybe something to try again, but it's hard to want to go back when there is a Benihana across the street.
