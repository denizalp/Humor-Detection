The good: pretty place, three different floors\/areas (the main room, the terrace and the hip hop room). Different music and atmosphere in each.\nThe bad: really really, crowded; was just chilling killing time until the dj decided to come\nThe ugly: they tell you to dress appropriately and that they can reject anyone on the basis of dress code. Yet, there are no chairs and you are not allowed to lean on ANY thing. There were girls in flip flops (super smart but hello? What about the dress code?) We tried to leave the place and come back an hour or so later (sincw we stayed at Caesars) to at least change our shoes or drink, but there was no reentry allowed- a fact most of the bouncers didn't even know about.\nPoint is, you know how they say good looking people are usually not-so-bright? The organization of this place is exactly like that. \nMy suggestion? Flats, pre-drinking and arriving not-too-early,  beware the longass lines though.
