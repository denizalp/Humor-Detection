Molti Beni. This F&E is a mile from my house. And I will be forever grateful to them for\nthe kindness they showed after an accident I was involved in in March.  The accident took place at that intersection, Wigwam and Eastern. I was the last one to give the police my version of events, so they had me pull my truck into The F&E parking lot. No sooner had  I\nset the brake, when a clerk from F&E sprinted up and asked if I wanted anything to drink,\ngratis. \"I saw what happened, sir, you have my sympathies.\" I had a cup of espresso and thus was born the start of a great relationship. I ate dinner there that night(they have a small food court with 6 tables) and dined on avocado and chicken wraps. Fresh and East is a smaller version of Trader Joes and has items you can't get anywhere else. Plus they're open 24\/7.\nI'm in there almost everyday and rarely buy groceries anywhere else. They would have my patronage even if they hadn't responded to my situation as they did. I'm nuts for nuts and\nthey have all of them, including Brazil nuts which I hadn't seen in a while. The only negative is\ntheir smoothie machine which has been down for 2 weeks! Fix it or get rid of it guys!
