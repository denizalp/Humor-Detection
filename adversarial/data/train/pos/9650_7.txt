I like it, I like it a lot. \n\nOf course, I rode my bike up there. I seem to be biking my way through South Scottsdale mildly inebriated. Somebody has to do it.\n\nCool bar, good happy hour, chill people there.\nDecent drinks, the bartender was too busy to get me my 2nd drink before happy hour was over, which sucked, but was not a huge deal in the grand scheme of things. \n\nI had fun. People there were friendly and fun to talk to. I got there during happy hour, and it was a mix of all ages. I had the chicken rolls and the sweet potato fries for my dinner. Both were greasy, but super delicious. This is not health food people. It is good greasy bar food.\n\nYou may not meet your fiance there, but you can have have fun and get a little sauced.  So if you want to go to a fun, laid back, bar go to Mickey's Hangover.
