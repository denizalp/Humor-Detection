Kohl's is a solid department store chain, and they run frequent sales- literally almost any item you pick up is almost guaranteed to be on some sort of discount. This is nice, but it's also irritating in that their original prices are overinflated in the first place so the \"sale\" price is more of a regular price but I digress.\n\nCame to this location this afternoon to browse. Clearance section was an unorganized mess, as were the fitting rooms. I ran into a few different employees but none greeted me, which was a bit odd. Signage now is digital, which saves the employees having to replace sale signage constantly- however, I noticed some was inaccurate or flat-out wrong (see image: sale price for \"V-neck shirts\" with undershirts that aren't V-necks at all). \n\nManaged to find a few bargains: athletic shorts for $9 and a solid purple modal tee for a more casual work look, $6- both rang up even lower at the register ($6.75 and $5, respectively). Cashier was polite, when we left there was a lady stationed at the door to greet customers as business picked up.
