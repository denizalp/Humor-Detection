To say this place is at most a tone star is being generous.\nI visited on occasion in the past, when they still had that delicious banana split for dessert, and that was ok. Service was still lacking back then and the food took extremely long.\n\nI don't know when LB decided to take a nose dive into disaster town and become even worse.\n\nThe burgers are 'ok.' So I thought I would try something else this time, since the burgers aren't a hit, I'll try some deep fried pickles and chicken waffles.\nDeep fried pickles were oily, hard, and bland. Batter. Everywhere.\nChicken & waffles? Lies. It was chicken and biscotti. The precut pieces of waffle were rock hard. Completely inedible. Chicken was drenched in salty teriyaki sauce. Don't expect the traditional chicken and waffles. \n\nWaitress explained that the head chef was off that day, and half heartily apologized. Then billed us the full amount, without even clearing the full plate of inedible food. \nThank you. I really needed to be reminded of the food I didn't eat, and now I am paying for.\n\nFinal note, they use Bell or something and do not broadcast most MLB games.\n\nReview #6 of Yelp's 30 Day Challenge 2012
