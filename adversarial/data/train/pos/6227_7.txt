I also purchased the Groupon for botox, as did my friend.  It was not our first experience with botox.  We went together for our appointments and both felt we were rushed through like cattle.  Reva quickly explained the amount of botox purchased could go \"here, here or here\".  I said I wanted to get rid of the \"elevens\" between my eyes and my friend wanted it around her eyes for crow's feet.  I asked if it was worth using the amount of botox for the area and her answer was \"I can not advise you\".  Great.  You're supposed to be the expert.  I can't remember if she wore gloves but she did inject us VERY quickly!  She only asked us to \"smile\" once to place the botox.  Last time I had it done it was injected slower and I was asked to smile several times.  My friend wanted to purchase additional botox, but didn't feel comfortable with Reva.  Over a week later my friend has not seen a difference in her crow's feet, HOWEVER my left eyelid is DROOPING...A LOT!  I read online that only 1-2% have this side effect and it's usually caused when a procedure is carelessly done.  Lucky me!  Nothing I can do about it....just have to wait for the botox to go away.  Which means I have to look like a stroke victim for the next 3-6 months!  Before my eyelid drooped, I would not have gone back or recommended her.  Now I definitely won't!  Maybe someone else out there loves her....me, not so much.
