Very disappointing! My family and I visited a large number of dealerships over the course of two weeks and Horne Kia was by far the worst!\n\nI had been helping my sister shop for a new car and I came across a vehicle on Horne Kia's website that was the specific model and trim level I really wanted her to see.  It was listed on the Horne Kia website at $4,000 more than an identical car (same year\/model\/color\/trim) listed at another dealer nearby, so I called ahead and spoke with \"Mike\".\n\nWe discussed the other, identical car and he said he \"might not be able to match the price of the competitor's car exactly\", but he promised he could \"get really close\".  I explained that I had to make arrangements with my sister and didn't want to make the drive clear across town if he wasn't absolutely certain that he could get very close to the competitor's price.  He said \"no problem, we can make it happen\" and told me to come on in.\n\nI gathered my sister, my father and my wife and drove across town to see the vehicle.  Mike was there when we arrived, but he immediately handed us off to another salesperson, Eric, as Mike was helping someone else (even though I had informed him that we were on our way).\n\nWe took the test drive and my sister absolutely loved the car, as I expected.  Interested in the car, we went inside to talk numbers.\n\nThey started the \"deal\" at a higher price than was listed on the car!  I was a little put off by this, but it was the first round of negotiations, so I patiently explained the situation to Eric.  He left and returned a while later with an updated offer.  This time at FULL sticker price!  I said that obviously wasn't going to do.  He got a little sharp with us, but I made it clear we didn't want to play games, so he left again.  \n\nAfter another wait, he returned with the dealership's \"Best Offer\".  The result? A discount of just $75.  I was as much confused as I was offended.\n\nI again referred to the conversation with Mike and explained that a mere $75 discount on a $24,000 car was almost an insult. Eric said they couldn't do any better.  I explained that I was disappointed as we really liked the car and had hoped for better.  We got up from the table, shook Eric's hand and I informed him that we were going to leave. I asked for a manager's card before I left, which he then left to get.  \n\nHe made us wait a substantial amount of time, likely to see if we would leave on our own without the manager's card.  However, we continued to wait.  When he finally returned, instead of bringing the manager's card, he brought Mike.  \n\nMike proceeded to confront us about the failed sale.  He changed what he had said, suggested that we didn't know how things work (I've helped friends and family buy more than 20 cars from dealerships...I know how it works) and even went so far as to claim I was making up most of the conversation we had earlier that day!  My father became upset, as he had been sitting with me when I made the call to Mike and had overheard the entire thing.  \n\nI reminded Mike that the only reason I had made arrangements for all of us to come down and endured the drive was because of what he had told me on the phone and I wasn't interested in arguing, we just wanted to leave.  \n\nUnable to accept fault to any degree, Mike persisted.  Every time he opened his mouth, it made us feel less appreciated.\n\nI stated that we had been looking forward to making a deal that day and I didn't understand why they would approach us like this as we were leaving.  He was spending more time butting heads with us than trying to keep us as customers!  \n\nI finally got tired of the circular conversation and informed him and Eric (again) that we were leaving.  My sister and my wife, frustrated and unhappy, had already gone to wait in my car.  I again asked Eric for the manager's card.  Eric and Mike left.\n\nOnce again, instead of going and getting the manager's card for me, Eric returned empty handed, this time with the sales manager, Anthony, in tow.  \n\nAnthony was pleasant, but I had to try and stay calm as I explained our position on the deal a third time.  Anthony said Mike shouldn't have made promises he couldn't keep and said he'd have a talk with Mike regarding his conduct, but I'm not convinced anything happened after we left.  \n\nUnfortunately, the damage had been done and the four of us left VERY emotional and distraught.  If we had been allowed to leave when the deal first went south, we would simply have been disappointed and this might be a 3-star review.\n\nSimply put, this should have been an exciting and positive interaction, particularly for my sister who was genuinely looking forward to buying a car that day, but it degraded to become the worst dealership interaction we experienced in our search.\n\nIf you want to feel appreciated as a customer, I can assure you that there are many dealerships around the valley who make that their priority.  Unfortunately, Horne Kia isn't one of them.\n\nAvoid if you can!
