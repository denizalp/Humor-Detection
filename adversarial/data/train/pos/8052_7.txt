On a not-so-typical Saturday, my husband wakes up and can not move. Well okay, not full out paralysis, after all my hunky monkey is a weight lifting stud who takes pretty good care of himself...but his back was not allowing his lower body to move without pain. So we rush, all ambulance style to the chiropractor before he closes and are told that the big man has a serious back strain for which he must rest. We go out to the fine little cab that is my 07 Accord, hubby walking like a 90 year old and the car will not start. WTF? \n\nDid I mention the hunk was also a grease monkey at one point in time? Oh yeah, he says, its dead. Summoning my charm to the Tempe Muni guys who had just pulled up for lunch at Jason's, they gave us a jump AND refused to let us buy them lunch. Big love to them...Raced down the street to Purcell's where we pulled in and 20 minutes later [hubby still in car, playing solitare on his phone and waiting patiently to be medicated] had a new battery!\n\nThe manager is from Beantown - he and the mechanic who installed could not have been nicer. Speedy in, speedy out [on a Saturday, no less] and most importantly, no bullshit. Would go back there in a flash -
