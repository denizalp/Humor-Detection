After a failed attempt at dining here during my last conference in sin city, we finally were able to do so during our anniversary (http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q?select=l0-Vn9-CqktfBe8iPgc77Q).  I've been fortunate to have been able to dine at both and can say that I've become a fan of Joel Robuchon.  The decor is contemporary and the open kitchen concept (http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q?select=LEp1nXhlTZGeu92-8oLepQ) offers a more relaxed atmosphere than the more formal dining next door.\n\nI had a few dishes that I had in mind that I knew I wanted and after a few minutes of figuring out how hungry we were, we decided on the seasonal discovery tasting menu (http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q?select=poPCaItVyrlBqNPN9QaM1g).  Just shortly after our water was pourted, the bread basket was placed in front of us (http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q?select=vANaZCAp5sZ1twkUoDhDpQ).  Unlike Robuchon, L'Atelier only offers a few choices for bread.  All 3 varieties were very good but the olive oil and sea salt croissant was amazing, flakey and very very tasty.\n\nL'amuse bouche (http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q?select=s4DFz4jjdW5Orjy0DRI89w).  Avocado and cilantro flavored grapefruit gelee.  The grapefruit aftertaste left the palate with a light and refreshing and wished I had more than just the little shot glass.\n\nLes tomatoes (http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q?select=8yXf9FzHhCdMuUtFWjnOSg).  The heirloom tomato salad was perfectly seasoned as the basil oil and fleur de sel perfectly matched the natural sweet taste of the tomatos.\n\nLes huires (http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q?select=AHQwwTC1cwwoPbnkQ-CqGg).  Poached baby Kussi oysters with French echire butter.  I can honestly say that I'm not a fan of oysters but damn were these tasty.  I've tasted Kussi oysters at Bouchon and thought they were good but these little bad boys blew those out of the water.  May have been the butter...what isn't good with butter??\n\nLe crabe royal (http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q?select=rCkQiJcs-_n9RWujERb8Sw).  My piece of crab was a little chewy, maybe just an older piece of crab but was tasty nonetheless.  The lemongrass oil left a refreshing aftertaste but wasn't overly impressed with the vegetables on top of the crab.\n\nL'asperge (http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q?select=PjsxdV1hyr7eKE1307E0Xg).  I was excited to see Iberico ham served with this dish but was disappointed with the two tiny hair like slivers on top of the quail egg.  The asparagus was perfectly cooked and was very flavorful.  After tasting the Iberico ham, I knew I had to order a side of it.\n\nIberico ham (http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q?select=BDdtenuj3Ebg3Av31tIZgg).  This was brought out after the sole filet (http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q?select=1rLS5dKtwK0fT648QeKR7g).  At this point of the meal, I was getting extremely full and slightly buzzed as I ordered the wine pairing.  That didn't stop me from devouring the entire plate.  OMG I wish we could readily get this ham from a local butcher shop here in LA.  The ham was sliced paper thin and literally melts in your mouth (http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q?select=zG_PPE50tHeJMxOG2qhHRQ).\n\nLa sole (http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q?select=VKMyGyUvRs_6-OSDiQB2aQ).  The sole filet was perfectly cooked and the buttery shellfish sauce perfectly complemented the fish.  \n\nFor the main entree, I ordered the La caille (http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q?select=oteuPqbgHifhbotTvM-RAQ).  One reason is that I'm a huge fan of quail and that fact that I hate lamb.  The piece of foie gras was slightly overcooked but the quail was awesome.  Robuchon mashed potatoes were velvety and very very rich.  A must try if you haven't had Robuchon mashed potatoes.  \n\nLa fraise (http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q?select=0Wg3dw22rV_uCGLUaBHmQA).  Mascarpone panna cotta topped with fresh strawberries and served with balsalmic ice cream.  The strawberries and balsalmic ice cream tasted amazing together.  The panna cotta at the bottom was also very good.\n\nLa mure (http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q?select=lHll2a6IDnyYUcY4JWGGSg).  Blackberry compote w\/ spice cake and rhubarb sorbet.  Another awesome dessert.\n\nLe cafe (http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q?select=l22vhvGXgmTjYT81Azg80A).  French pressed coffee served with a piece of chocolate!!\n\nNot sure how I was able to fit all of the food into my stomach that night but damn I would do it all over again without hesitation.  Hope to dine here in the near future.  Oh service was awesome and needless to say the food was amazing!!!
