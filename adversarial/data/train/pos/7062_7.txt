I waited awhile to write this review, because I didn't want to be the only person in Pittsburgh who did not like this yoga studio.  Well here goes. I purchased a pass for $35.00 for admission to three classes and only used it on one class and I will not be returning for any additional classes. At the start of the class the instructor asked the class what we would all like to work on. One attendee said \"the core\"  I had read  the class description several times online and had signed up for a class called \"slow flow\" which I took to mean more focus on stretching and slow deliberate movements...boy was I wrong.  I felt that for a class called slow flow it was very challenging and I was more tense afterwards then I had been before. \n\nPersonally I can see more advanced yogies having a great time and really enjoying themselves here, but for me as a beginner I felt totally out of the loop and even felt that I was snapped at for not telling the instructor I was a beginner. \n\n\nThis yoga study does not have any showers...which for me as some who catches the bus made for a pretty uncomfortable bus ride home.  \n\nThe studio was very warm and cozy and Yoga Hive is a lovely facility even if it lacks showers. It's just not for me. I need more guided mediation and yoga for stress relief not to build abs. \n\nI am pretty sad, will I never be able to find a yoga studio to which I can belong? I have these two additional passes that I am certain have expired by now.  I hope every one else enjoys their yoga though.
