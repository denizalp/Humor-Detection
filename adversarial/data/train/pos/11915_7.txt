Very good service...very clean....expensive...no flavor or seasoning. ..must be English or Irish inspired.  No spices.  Not fishy tasting this is done very pure but bland ...... restaurant always empty. Hence the Groupon probably. Cole slaw is very good.... and bring your own Tartar sauce, there's taste  like ranch dressing....
