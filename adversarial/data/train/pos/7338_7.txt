Buffets are interesting.  \n\nSome times, you go and eat a ton ignoring the quality of the food.  Other times, you go and eat as much as you can knowing full well that you're scarfing down some good restaurant grade grub.  Le Village Buffet falls kind of in the middle.  \n\nThe Ups:\nGood Crepes\n\nThe downs:\nCrab Legs not always fresh tasting and hard to eat\nDesserts selection is sub par (Minus the crepes)\nService\n\nThe middle grounds:\nThe prime rib, chicken, veggies, pastas, rice, etc.\n\nSo what, why?  When you have so many choices of buffets in a place like vegas, there's no reason you should go somewhere you don't love.  Honestly, most the food is just okay and one of the biggest appealing things for me is the snow crab\/king crab legs.  Since this place's weren't that good, it's just okay by my standards.  That and the waitresses that served us on multiple occassions were not attentive.  It could be that we had a big group but it could also just be that they forced us to have the 18% tip and they didn't want to earn it.  \n\nIn the end, I'd go back if others want to but I'd rather go somewhere else.
