Craving for a juicy and cheesy burger? Not calorie counting? Then this place has got what you need! I have tried the quarter pounder cheeseburger and chili cheese fries. They are covered in the thickest pieces of cheddar, swiss and provolone cheese I have ever seen. The buns have a slight sweetness to it and is pretty dense. I would want to guess it almost tastes like a brioche bun. The meat is juicy and seasoned with salt and pepper. Fuddruckers just doesn't hit the spot for a night of gluttony, it punches the spot.
