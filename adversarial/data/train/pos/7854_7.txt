Whenever I'm at Gold Coast, my choice is either Ping Pang Pong or Noodle Exchange. Usually during the colder season, I tend to opt for Noodle Exchange for their hot pots. \n\nSERVICE\nTypical service you get at any other Chinese restaurant. Not too friendly, but they are quick to take your order, refill drinks, get you the check or anything else you need. \n\nFOOD\nMy usual is their Beef Combination ($14.99). You get a choice of mild or spicy but I can't handle any heat so I always get mild. You get a medium sized pot with a tea bag (?) which contains all kinds of spices in it. I actually ripped it open one time to investigate what was inside, as if I was in a biology lab doing a dissection. This tiny bag had herbs, slices of ginger and other unknown spices that I had no clue of. Needs further investigation. \n\nBeef Combination comes with mushrooms, tofu, fish cakes, corn tomato, daikon, taro, noodle and fish balls. Beef is thinly sliced and is very similar to shabu shabu. You also get a choice of lamb or seafood combination hot pot but I have only ordered beef.  It's a decent portion and I always enjoy cooking at the table.\n\nCONCLUSION\nCome here for the hot pot! Place is always packed and super loud but I am coming back again on another cold day.
