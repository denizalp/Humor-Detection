I have taken my dog to this Vet and I am disgusted how I was treated.  First my dog has a caugh and has had issues lately caughing all the time... \n\nWhen we arrived at the clinic the vets rushed her into the room and looked at her closely.  They said that it is probably Valley Fever and made us aware it would cost $720.00 to obtain if it is or NOT... This is a joke right...  I asked then if the medicine is really bad to have the animal take without running X Rays and Bloodwork and she said no...  Then turns around and says she wont prescribe anything till they get blood atleast drawn.  We would have to wait a couple of days till we could actually find out if it was or not.  \n\nAfter now we have spent 160 for blood drawn 100 for initial visit with antibiotics and now another additional 60 dollars for Valley Fever medicine.  WHICH my dog only had ONE SYMPTOM.  NONE of the extreme symptoms were apparent.  \n\nTODAY ...  we now found out its NONE of the above and its probably heartworm and they said with the initial bloodwork drawn they would charge us only another 35 dollars to run that test then we would have to put her on that medicine as well \ncosting who knows?\n\nCan anyone recommend an actual doctor not someone who is just running us around for her own bill making benefits.  I have spent $400.00  and have recieved nothing from this vet.\n\nPlease be aware I could do this Vets job if I know the Rx for animals... Hell all you have to do at this clinic is start at the top of what it could be and start prescribing.  Once the dog is fixed then you can claim you have a clue.\n\nThis is very wrong and not right for a Vet to practice with these suggestions.\n\nHere's one lets draw blood $160.00 then find out what it is entirely before we scare a patient into buying $400.00 worth of nothing.
