Since I learned of the demise of Sushi 67 (*tear*), I've been hoping to find another creative sushi restaurant.  I'm not a stickler for traditional sushi, I love when they try something a little different.  And we found it in Kawa Sushi!\n\nWe unfortunately ordered way more than we could eat.  It was very, very sad.  Our eyes were simply bigger than our stomachs.  BUT, at least we got a taste of everything we ordered.  We started with edamame, which was delicious and salty.  We also had the Crazy Roll, the Green Dragon Roll, the Moscow Roll, and the Salmon Kamakachi Roll.  Moscow was probably my favourite, even though I couldn't fit it in my mouth in one bite.  I made a failed attempt, then had to bite it in half.  It stayed together though, and was absolutely delicious.  Most of the rolls didn't even need soy sauce!  \n\nAll in all, a great little sushi place that I will definitely be back to.  If only there was a place like this on the Danforth!
