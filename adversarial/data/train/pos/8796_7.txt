To start off...I'm never one to complain. I honestly wanted to give them a good review since Sheila was super nice, helpful and polite at check-in. All of the staff were great but the only complaint is the quality of the rooms and just the hotel itself. If your looking for a nice place to stay at a low price, this isn't it...you get what you pay for here. 1 out of the 2 elevators were broken and the one remaining elevator took at least 5 minutes to come. When it did, it only fit about 5 out of the 7 people waiting with luggage and was completely cramped. When we got to the room, I found a hair in our ice bucket, the room smelt like weed from the people next door and I spotted a cricket in our bathroom and one in the hallway. Not only did it smell like weed due to the fact that the vents between rooms are perfectly aligned but you can also hear every word your neighbors are saying and I'm sure vise versa. The biggest problem we experienced was the water in the shower fluctuating in temperature from warm to almost scalding hot. It was either that or luke warm to freezing cold. We went with the second option with concern of possibly being burned. Again, the customer service was great but the only thing I didn't agree with is the fact that I called the front desk and informed them of the problem and our concern and all they did was say we have never heard of this before and dismissed it. In the end, Hooters is an older dated hotel and if your ballin on a budget then this could be your only option coming to Vegas but if you have even a little extra money to spend, I'd recommend checking out the Trop next door.
