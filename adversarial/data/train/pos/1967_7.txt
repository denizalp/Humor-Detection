Ah the Tilted Kilt. Met a friend here Thursday evening around 530pm for a quick beer before heading out for the night. My memories of Tilted Kilt were mostly about the hot beautiful ladies serving and bartending, so I was quite shocked to see a guy bartending on this particular evening. No offense to him, he was a very good bartender and knowledgeable on beers, but I can find that at hundreds of other places in town. I wanted to see cute girls!!!!\n\nThe 3 stars is because their selection of beverages, while eclectic, is pretty routine and lacks a good Hefeweizen. I had the Joseph James local one, and it was lacking for my taste buds with a bit too much hoppiness.
