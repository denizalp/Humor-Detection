It's Hot Topic. BUT this location has extra-awesome staff. They remember you by name, help you find what you're looking for and are just all around helpful.\n\nUntil recently I hadn't shopped at a Hot Topic for over 10 years. So--this may or may not be the case--but it feels like they've made a major shift toward geeky over what I remember being a goth\/music-centric store. I love it! I've found Zelda, Star Wars, Batman and Nintendo themed items, Pop collectibles, TONS of t-shirts ranging from bands to fringe geeky stuff. I love it all. They've also found their perfect niche in the chic-goth arena. To give you an idea--just a couple of weeks ago I found almost everything I needed for my Catwoman costume here--then I found a leg harness and sweet, black hosiery and jewelry! If you're not into this harness trend, you just need to see how they're being worn with high fashion outfits. So chic. \n\nDid I mention the staff is awesome? I did. OK. \n\nIf you haven't been in Hot Topic in years and you're into geeky stuff, goth-chic trends or cool band shirts, check them out again!
