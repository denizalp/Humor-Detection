If your waiter has a faux hawk and mutton chops, go ahead and kick that d-bag in the balls for me.  \nThis was the worst service I have ever had in my life.  Took two hours to eat a quesadilla cause our ass whipe of a waiter couldn't be found.  When he was found, he would bring you the wrong drink, or poor water into your soda.\nAll in all, I would give this place zero if I could.  I just hope that DoucheBag McMuttonChops didn't spend his $0.20 tip in one place.
