I will be back to buy crepes at this place.\n\nI've been looking for a place that makes Japanese style of crepes. Finally Crepe Shack & Waffles is the place now! Unfortunately, I live about 30 minutes away :(\n\n\nI had The Mix, it was good, I only hope that they can cook the crepe a little longer to make the crepe crunchy.. that would be great. But the consistency of the crepe is good because it is stretchy.  Will be back for more because this shack is the one and only Japanese crepe shack in Las Vegas!
