I went here this afternoon so I could pick up a new helmet. I wanted something a little less dorky than my current, more traditional helmet. I know there's nothing 'dorky' about safety, but let's be real, folks, I am an attractive woman! I should have an attractive helmet!\n\nThe selection here is smaller than the likes of Curbside Cycles (though bigger than Pete's) but the staff are lovely. The guy who helped me ignored the phone as it rang and rang (and rang and rang!) just to dig around in boxes and locate more styles for me to find. At one point I said, \"You can get that if you want...?\" and he said something along the lines of 'what makes you think I want?' So yeah, definitely a lot of focus and attention on the customer. \n\nHe didn't judge me for wanting a 'fun' helmet either. I was distinctly afraid of this because if I were a bikespert, I would judge people like me.\n\nThe only thing that was a less than perfect was that he wouldn't put the helmet I wanted on hold for an hour. He said it was their policy for when it's the last one and with it being bike season, helmets sell quick, but it was still kind of a bummer. I was on a bit of a tour to check out helmets and splash guards all around the area so I was planning on shopping around a bit. I snapped it up as the price was reasonable and I was wary of someone beating me to it (this has happened twice in the last couple of weeks and I'm still grieving).\n\nOne last thing: I spotted some cute (see! See why I am surprised he didn't judge me??) locks and asked what they were like. The sales guy had no qualms telling me they were pretty rubbish and really only for children's bikes or secondary locks. That honesty was nice since he probably could have taken me for a total sucker (pro tip: I am a total sucker).
