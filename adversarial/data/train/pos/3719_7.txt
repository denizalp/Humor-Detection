Unless this restaurant figures out how to handle the post game crowds, some crazy fan, high on their own testoserone is going to go ape shit over the lengthy, hostess-quoted wait times.  They're going to get extra pissed off when they have to wait even longer to get service.  And unless they get the girl I got tonite, it's all downhill after the wait.\n\nTheir lack of a system for the celebratory masses (luckily the Cards won today), sets the waitstaff up for shitty tips.  My server had mercy on me and told me what to order if I wanted to eat right away.  That left me ordering the Filet Mignon Chili and caesar salad combo.  And my 2nd choice beer that I guessed they have, Sam Adams.  They didn't have my beloved Newcastle. \n\nNow the chili was good, but the idea of having filet mignon meat is all marketing goodness.  Like I could taste the difference???  My filet mignon should be mooing in front of me after having been broiled to a medium rare perfection, not bobbing around in a bowl of tomatoes and other crap.\n\nMy friend ordered the Buffalo Nachos, which we found both strange and strangely good.  And evenly though it was a plate piled high with chips, the cheese and everything else seemed thrown together, like the chefs said, we can get away with this one cuz who actually makes neat nachos.\n\nI dole out the 3 stars for our server who gave us her best \"this is the best I can do\".  I guess it was better than absolute crap.
