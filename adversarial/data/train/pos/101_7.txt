I used to avoid this hotel because it was SO old and dated.  On my last trip to Charlotte, I decided to give it another try as I had heard that they had begun renovating.  It turned out that I got a room on a floor that had been recently refreshed.  \n\nEverything on the floor was nice.  Fresh paint, new hallway carpet (with nice padding and was easy on your feet), a completely re-done room.  The decor was brand new and modern.  I think the designer did a great job.  The furniture looked nice but was also practical.  The layout was well-planned.  I appreciated some of the nice touches--like the clothes steamer.  There didn't seem to be an iron, but the steamer did the trick for me.\n\nLocation is everything, and it's hard to beat that with the Omni.  That's probably what kept it going even when the hotel was looking sad.  \n\nService was very friendly.  I appreciated the skills of the front desk clerks, who provided excellent service in a low-key kind of way.  Well done.
