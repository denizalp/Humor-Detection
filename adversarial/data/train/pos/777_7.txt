I have had fish not so fresh here before.  Overly fishy tasting and slimy. I was weary about eating here again.   Of course I was outnumbered. It is close by and open later. \n\nI went for all you can eat so I could have variety.   My favorite is the super white tuna.  They redeemed themselves!  It tasted clean and fresh.  The delicious lemony acidic sauce they serve on the regular menu.  All the raw fish I ordered was great!  My boyfriend said he didn't recognize the chef and he must be new, perhaps this change is the improvement in the quality they are serving. \n\nOur server seemed to be in a bad mood.  Must have been an off day for him.  Also we were the last guests for the evening.   He did make a great suggestion for the ribeye.  It was tasty and the veggies were cooked just right.  I wasn't able to fill my stomach.  We arrived before closing time.   \n\nHope this quality remains consistent.  I'd like to arrive earlier next time to try everything else.
