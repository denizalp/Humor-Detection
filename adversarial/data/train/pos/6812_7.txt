I have had the most amazing hand tossed pizza's from New York and Connecticut. Rocco's pizzeria is not on that level. It is just a great local pizza for a great to-go price.\n\nIt was Friday movie night at home with my guy. The pizza really hit the spot while curled up on a sofa near the television. \n\nThe customer service was awesome. The store is clean. I would come again if I was in a hurry and wanted to bring home a pizza.
