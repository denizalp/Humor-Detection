I could not agree more with all of the negative reviews. Once you sign a lease, they keep at you morning, noon & night to extend you lease which will go way beyond the regular school semester. The rents are sky high when you look at the market rate. When you leave Rebel, they will nickle and dime you for months and even charge for cleaning & painting when that is normal wear & tear. \n\nRun as fast as you can from Rebel (Rip-off) Place!
