I WANTED to love it.  But honestly did not.  Pittsburgh is a rough market.  And with all the competing new places...I don't know when\/if I'll be back.  \n\nI went with a date to Pittsburgh Restaurant Week.  I was really wary of this.  I've never done Restaurant Week.  I was worried that maybe they'd have something \"off menu\" to showcase the restaurant then if I came back some other time I wouldn't be able to find it.  I confirmed that the selections were available and perused the menu just to see if something REALLY jumped out at me.  \n\nIt didn't.  That sounds negative, but I don't mean it to; the restaurant week menu looked good.  I didn't see anything that said...\"Try me I am way more amazing\".  \n\nThe waiter seemed knowledgeable, and was helpful and attentive.  The ambience was...pretty, but not particularly memorable once you get past the statement-mural of moby dick launching over the bow of the Pequod (I assume that's the Pequod...*insert 30 minute google search for diagrams of Nantucket whaling vessels*...it's probably the Pequod), the only truly decoratively arresting feature would be a series of thick parallel ropes festooning the length of the ceiling.  I did like that the restaurant was two levels, and the stairway was eye-catching.  \n\nI don't recall the drink menu.  Does that mean it's not memorable?  I suppose by definition it WOULD mean that, but my short term memory is a bit suspect more and more lately.  So maybe the drinks are good.\n\nAnyway...good seafood.  I enjoyed the experience.  But it was nothing that a dozen other restaurants can't match.
