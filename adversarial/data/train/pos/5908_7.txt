Nothing to complain about The Mirage. \nThe hotel is clean and the casino is well ventilated. They have some awesome restaurants!\n\nMy room was cute, clean and loved the decor. I loved the fact that I had a MILLION pillows (i'm exaggerating a bit) and the bed was comfy. \n\nLocated close to clubs, bars, restaurants...I would probably consider staying here again.
