Just had my car washed here for the first time. The person who checked me in and the cashier were both very friendly. \n\nThey DID try to sell me the chip repair as other reviews have mentioned - they are very sneaky and say \"it won't cost you a thing... We just need your insurance card.\" But a simple \"no thank you\" and they leave it alone\n\nI am used to \"hand\" car washes that run the car through a machine and just hand dry it, so I went to remove my rear antenna (it does not retract) and they said it would be fine since they don't use machines. That's nice \n\nI got the \"ultimate\" wash because on Thursdays they give ladies 30% off, so it was $21 + tip. Looks clean enough to me. They did wipe out the junk tray and cup holders. This whole time I thought my dash was grey but it turns out it's actually black and was just super filthy. My view while driving is really different now! \n\nThey did miss quite a bit of the \"gunk\" (protein shake? Coffee? Dog barf? Who knows?) on my passenger seat. I was able to get it off with a Lysol wipe but the whole point of having my car washed is not having to do it myself. \n\nOverall not bad for $20ish bucks
