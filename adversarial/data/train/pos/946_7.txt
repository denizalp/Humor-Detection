Kiosk\n\nThis review is for the self-service kiosk that we used for the first time ever at an Alamo location. Arrived in Las Vegas during one of their very busy weekend -- the Mayweather\/Pacquiao fight at the MGM Grand. The line was long and service was slow, this was around 10:30p, behind the counters there were only two service clerks that evening (well, maybe three) but they should have anticipated the crowd coming in town that weekend.  Saw some people try the kiosks, not very many. There was an attendant manning the do-it-yourself machines helping customers. Still in line, debating whether we should try it, but we were very close to being helped... ahh! forget the long line, we decided to leave our spot and go to a kiosk. Took 10 minutes with the assistance of the attendant and before we could say 'Viva Las Vegas!' we were out of there and heading to the garage to get our rental car. Love that kiosk! Should've gone there in the first place!  Returning the car was just as fast. No hassle and painless.  Will use again :)\n\nReview #0293
