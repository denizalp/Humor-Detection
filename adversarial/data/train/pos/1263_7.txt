Ok horrible bartender named Joey. She must have had the most stank ass attitude I have ever seen in a bartender. Usually when I sit at a bar I get service this chick acted like she was to busy or to good to serve me, mind you it's a super small bar with not many bar stools, so when it took ten minutes to get a drink I told her what I wanted and she had the audacity to roll her eyes at me.. I will never return to that bar. I wouldn't recommend this establishment to anyone 0 star
