I'm a huge fan of 244 Pizza & Wings! I've been coming here maybe about once a month (or sometimes more) for my wings & wedges fix for the last few years and have yet to be disappointed! Their wings are big, saucy and oh so delicious. We usually get the suicide flavor with extra sauce so I can dip my wedges in it as well. Their honey garlic is also yummy. And if you're feeling adventurous you can even ask them to mix the suicide sauce with the honey and garlic for some spicy and sweet goodness. You can even ask for just the battered wings with sauce on the side if you don't like too much sauce. They're very accommodating! Lastly, the price is right for what you're getting. Best bang for your buck! \n\nThe pizza on the other hand is not that great, but pretty good value for what you pay for it. I only come here for the wings and wedges so that's what my 5\/5 star review is for as I've yet to find better wings anywhere else in (West) Toronto!\n\nThere's ample street parking on Weston Rd and also a green P lot right across the street.
