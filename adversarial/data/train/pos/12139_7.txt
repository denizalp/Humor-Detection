Four years ago I smacked my head on their questionably-placed flat screen. They moved the TV.  I create real change.  I am like Gandhi. I'm Glendhi. \n\nThere are three bars at Gold Coast.  This one is the best for big groups because it has tables and is twice as big as the bowling lounge.  And you know what you'll find on the flatscreen? My scalp.
