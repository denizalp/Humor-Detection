Man, I think we just beat the rush! \n\n3 of us took a cab over here on Sunday evening for a quiet, off-strip meal. The yelp reviews spoke highly of this place so why not? \n\nWe grabbed our free mango lassies with the check in and also purchased the $20 for $30 deal as we sat down. Oddly our waiter was a little cold when he took our drinks order but by the end of the evening he was all smiles and jokes. \n\nThe food portions were healthy without being obnoxious. \n\nThough the place was largely empty when we stepped in around 6, by the time we left, there were a good 20-30 people lined up for the buffet. Clearly a popular choice.
