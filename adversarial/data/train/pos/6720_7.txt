Tucked away in the complex corner and a little hard to find. Came here with a friend to check out the specials. Plus it is close to my work. Nice!\n\nInside has the basic Chinese theme going on with lighting that could be improved. It was hard to see the menu and even the food. Now where is my trusty flashlight app?\n\nOrdered the Hunan Beef lunch special and my friend went with something that had sweet and sour sauce. It may have been Lemon Chicken. They both came out with a small cup of the soup of the day. That day it was Egg Drop with small pieces of corn in it.\n\nThe food was basically the standard Americanized deal. The sauces are pretty heavy and you end up finishing your plate with a spoon. Both dishes were good and could easily be ordered for take out and it would probably not make much of a difference.\n\nService was decent with a small language barrier. It was fun watching them deliver the different orders to the tables. They had a small push cart and it would travel slowly around the room. \n\nThe best part to this restaurant is the value. The prices are very reasonable and the portions are rather large. Give them a visit and see what you think. FORTUNE COOKIE SAYS ... !\n\n3.25 STARS
