I was hungry and had a short time before I had to catch a flight so I ate here despite the reviews on Yelp.  I had Sammy's Cubano Sandwich which has pork shoulder, ham, Swiss cheese, pickles and spicy brown mustard (no aiolli for me) and had it with the Kicked Up Fries which is fries with queso fresco and red chili spice.  I was very pleased with my meal.  \n\nThe service was speedy but could have been more friendly.  The prices are what you would except to pay at an airport.  I was just passing through so I probably won't eat here again but, A-OK.
