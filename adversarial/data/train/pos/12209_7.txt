Why do birds suddenly appear?  Every time you are near (in the garden room cause their waiting for you to feed them) Just like me they long to be close to you (especially when you start feeding them bits of fries)  This place is amazing especially the garden room.  I wish I had a better camera phone, but just one small shot of the place doesn't do it justice.  The Food is awesome - had me a Duck Confit sandwich and a side of fries.  Yum yum yum all the way (didn't feel right feeding the birdes duck so I didn't -- it's your cousin man!)  Service was top and on the ball.  They were there when I needed them and they were gone when they needed to be gone :) Zinc Bistro thumbs up! - Enjoy
