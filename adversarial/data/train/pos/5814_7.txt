I was so excited when this place opened at the Met! The popcorn is the bomb and the management is very friendly. \n\nI frequent the metropolitan area a lot and popcorn is one of my favorite things..Therefore, I was ready to review Tastebuds when they came on to the scene. First and foremost the management is amazing! I met the owner and he was very pleasant to talk to. I shared my love of popcorn with him all while he let me sample anything and everything I wanted. Believe it or not, but the dill pickle flavor is my favorite!\n\nThe store itself is very clean and organized. I was told that they keep 50 flavors in the store at all times. These flavors are color coded by the types, which I think is a great idea. The types of popcorn they have are savory, candied, and chocolate. The prices are also different depending on the type, savory being the cheapest and personally my favorite kind. \n\nIn my opinion a small bag for $5.00 is not bad! In addition, they offer a 10% discount to employee's at the met. Score!
