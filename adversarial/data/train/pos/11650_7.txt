In 10 years, when you see Maury Povich cutting down a wall to rescue me from my house, you can attribute it to Rio's Carnival World buffet.\n\nI's amazing how much gluttony takes place when presented with an endless supply of fried, creamed, and broiled, options for $23.\nI have to admit, over the years, the Rio buffet has gone down in quality, but overall I still think this is the best buffet on the Vegas strip.  It's the variety that I like.  \nThe sushi is terrible, but they do a pretty good job with American cuisine and their Asian noodle bar is awesome.  \n\nBest part (worst part for my thighs) the dessert area!\nI love the cannolis!  I used to love the gelato too, but even this has gone down in quality.  I had some icy chunks in my gelato, and I tried like 5 different flavors.  They need to make an insulin flavored one for people like me.\n\nStill top on my list, I just hope they get their act together on the gelato. =p
