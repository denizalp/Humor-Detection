The only other Vegas show I could really compare this to was when Beyonce did an intimate performance at the Wynn a few years ago. Now, I love me some Queen Bey, who is nothing but a consummate professional, but I think that professionalism and that alter ego Beyonce assumes when performing creates a distance between her and her audience. \n\nCeline Dion is an entirely different kind of performer. When she was on stage, I felt like she was honestly just talking to me. She's so...personable. In a way, I felt this show was more intimate just because of the manner in which Celine carried herself, the way she would share her stories, show videos of her family, talk about her past and future hopes. And when she sang La Vie En Rose, I cried. Her voice is like an angel's, truly.\n\nOther things I could rave about were the costumes, pacing, and set designs. The dress during \"My Heart Will Go On\" literally took my breath away! Incredible. \n\nI grew up listening to Celine Dion and I went with family members who also enjoyed her music. I would say if you are at all familiar with her albums from the 90's, then I would highly, highly recommend the show. Totally worth the $!
