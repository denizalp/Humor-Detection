Firstly, I have had many pleasant experiences at this Sammy's Woodfired Pizza location. As a college student, I frequent Sammy's happy hour where tapas are half off. My boyfriend, myself, and my mother have spent many birthdays at Sammy's and are members of the Sammy's Pizza \"vip club\", which is just a program a customer can sign up for to receive special offers on purchases. \n\nHowever, today (July 22, 2017 at 4:01 p.m.) I placed an order for two mini duck taco tapas to go. Happy hour is from 4-6 as listed on Sammy's website. Which means half off of each tapas order. I have ordered to go orders during this specific happy hour before and had zero issues with receiving the happy hour discount. Even the Sammy's website DOES NOT indicate DINE IN customers ONLY receive happy hour on tapas or \"shareables\". I will attach a screenshot of this below. \n\nNonetheless, this time was trifling in terms of customer service and sticking to the company policy as listed on the website. I was told I could NOT receive the tapas discount on to go orders since that is their policy. I insisted that I had been to this Sammy's pizza location many, many, times and have received the happy hour price. A rude red head woman, (who would not give me her name), insinuated that I was lying and that \"no one here has ever done that\". I was shocked! I would not lie about something like this because, I enjoy eating Sammy's Woodfired food, especially the delicious duck tacos. \n\nThen I told the red headed woman, that \"it was fine and that I no longer wanted the tacos\". More specifically, I stated that I will \"just call corporate to address my concerns with customer service\". She rolled her eyes and said something under her breath. That really infuriated me, to which I said, \"If you have something to say, say it to my face\". She went on to say, \"your the one who walked in here all apprehensive\". Umm, EXCUSE ME, I walked in HAPPY to HAPPY hour to purchase my duck tacos; until I was not given the USUAL happy hour discount. \n\nOne woman, named Skylar went to the defense of the red headed woman (that again would not give me her name). Again, Skylar insisted that \"they\", NEVER did half off to go happy hour shareables. She asked who had given me the happy hour price before. I explained to her, \"I have come in SO many times for these duck tacos that I cannot remember every single server who gave me the valid happy hour price\". Skylar has seen me come in and rang up my happy hour order before and now wants to act oblivious (management can check the cameras for the past few months and see that I have come in and purchased food both dine in and carry out at happy hour). What a nice way to treat a repeat, paying, customer. \n\nThen, the manager, Anthony, came out and said \"well maybe they did you a FAVOR, but this is our policy NOW\". What do you mean by NOW? I told him, I was told by Skylar that their policy was \"always no discount on to go orders\". So which is it?! Was I, a paying customer done \"a favor\", or has the policy ALWAYS been the same? He changed his response to \"oh its not new, its always been the same\". So disgustingly unprofessional, to claim I was done \"favors\" in the past. Sammy's Woodfired Pizza desperately needs to educate their employees on customer service. \n\nAfter being throughly embarrassed and accused of being a liar, I told the staff to \"enjoy their duck tacos\", and I walked out. So much for happy hour. \n\nI have contacted corporate and await a response.
