I have now called the company to get Zayat's license number and he was the one on the phone. He would not give me any information and hung up on me. So I am letting everyone know DO NOT GET YOUR HAIRCUT HERE. THEY ARE RACISTS & HOMOPHOBES. Sayat yells at all of his customers and verbally abuses them. He asked me \"A Paying Customer\" if I like it up the ass. This man should be thrown in jail. NEVER GO HERE, I cannot wait to see this place CLOSE DOWN.
