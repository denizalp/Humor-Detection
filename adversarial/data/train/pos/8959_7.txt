Maybe I'm missing something. But this art walk was low on art, high on some piss-poor lunch trucks and snack vendors. I thought it sucked.\n\nI was really looking for the art. And the \"walk\" part of it.  It was very small and mostly reminded me of a high school carnival.  Was I in the wrong place?\n\nI was \"carded\" when I came in by a kid around 17 who never removed the cigarette from his lips as he spoke to me. We saw some musicians busking, but they were so close together, it was mostly just noise and people running into each other.\n\nThere were some adults, a handful of older people and couples, but mostly high schoolers in a lot of eyeliner and hoodies wandering around, smoking and saying fuck a lot.\n\nI'm no prude -- I've done all those things -- but it just wasn't the environment I was expecting based on the website's description. \n\n\"...once a month the pedestrian-friendly streets transform into a huge block party during FIRST FRIDAY. Each celebration, the entertainment shifts and multiplies as ice sculptors, fire breathers and fortune tellers serve as a back-drop for this ongoing festival of art perusal and appreciation. Local bands perform throughout the evening, and the streets turn into canvasses for children (young and old) to decorate with chalk. FIRST FRIDAY is a stage for local galleries and Las Vegas' vital Downtown cultural scene. It's a place to meet friends new and old, and rejoice in the preservation and innovation of an historical neighborhood. In this land of suburbs and strip malls, visitors come from near and far to people-watch, sample new restaurants and revel at area bars.\"\n\nHuge was an overstatement. I didn't see one fortune teller, fire breather, ice sculptor, restaurant or bar. I saw a little \"art\" (a talented cartoonist and some cheesy postcards).  I saw a mediocre comedian who seemed out of place.\n\nI honestly saw no art galleries. Maybe one, if that Funky House thing on the corner was an art gallery.\n\nWhere was the \"beautiful streetscape\" they mentioned?  We felt like we just were encased in a little cul-de-sac between some garages and some run-down shops.\n\nI love local history, local culture, I love old, I don't mind run-down. But it didn't live up to the hype.\n\nI'm convinced we must have been in the wrong place or there was a lot more we didn't see.  But we couldn't get past all the teens and there were no signs or information about where to begin or how to get there or where to park or anything.  So we just guessed and followed the people... and left after doing one lap and eating a smashed Chipwich.\n\nI likely won't be back unless someone can tell me where to be.
