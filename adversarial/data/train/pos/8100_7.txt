I was in the area (ish) and I had about half an hour to spare. I decided to look up some eyebrow threading places nearby to get my brows done. Laddi's was one of the top 5 results, the one with the most reviews, and a good 4 star overall review. It was about 15 minutes away from where I was but still decided to give it a go, and my brows definitely needed some loving.\n\nTook me a while to find it (tucked in the corner) but I was happy I found it eventually. I entered the store, and immediately felt like I walked into some party that I was clearly not invited to. Everyone was talking to each other, kids were running around, girls in shower caps were walking back and forth...I was confused. Good thing the front desk was right beside the door - walked up to the receptionist to ask if they do eyebrow threading, and she said yes. I politely asked her how long the wait will be. As she slowly eats her grapes, she glanced around like a Queen looking down at her peasants, and did not even bother to make eye contact with me, said \"just 5-10 mins\". I thought, I have already driven so far, might as well wait for couple minutes. So I sat on one of those benches\/couches near the door, which also confused me. Not sure if there was a line, or if they were waiting for others. It took me about 5 minutes of observing to learn that some of those who were sitting were waiting to get serviced, and some were just waiting for their kid\/parent\/so. \n\nEvery time a \"threader\" is done with one client, she would come up to us and say \"next\". No hi, no please, no thanks, no \"this way\", just \"next\", and expects someone to follow her. I found that hilarious, but also unprofessional.\n\n After about 10-12 minutes of waiting, I finally got my brows threaded. I am lucky to have pretty full brows, and I have been told by many \"threaders\" that it's so easy to do my brows as all I want is a clean up. I have couple outlier hairs that need to get rid of, a slight trim, and that's all that needs to be done. No need for shaping, or anything. \n\nThe lady that did my brows took less than a minute to do each side. She didn't even bother to dust off the brow hairs on my face. When she asked me to check, I could barely see anything because all the brow hair went into my eyes. When i got home to take a closer look at them, I was impressed at how horrible of a job she has done. My left brow was significantly longer than my right one. There were couple hair that she missed. I took my own tweezers and finished the job.\n\nIt was cheap - $3. But for this kind of service, I would not recommend to anyone. I don't care how cheap or expensive a service is, a business should operate like a business, not a factory or children's playground.
