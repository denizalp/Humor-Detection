THE PEOPLE THAT WORK HERE ARE ACTUALLY NICE!\n\nI come here mainly to drop off and pick up my prescriptions. Sometimes I wait for them to be filled because it only takes 15 minutes or so depending on how busy they are. This is the time frame when you discover all the gadgets and shiny things that  Walgreens has to offer. Some things remind you that you need it. Others you dont, but you try to convince yourself that you do like the pink foot warmer\/slippers that clean the floor and massage your feet while you walk. Im sure im not the only one that has that problem!\n\nAnyways, I love it when the stuff you do need is on sale. The guys that work there are always ready to help you with whatever you need. All the pharmacists that I have dealt with always seem to have a good attitude. Maybe cuz they have access to happy pills? J\/K. \n\nSo in closing, whatever I come here for, whether its for medicine, redbox, or other little misc things, I have yet to have a bad experience here. That's all anybody ever asks for. 5 stars and two thumbs up!
