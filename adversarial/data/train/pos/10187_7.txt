Cheryl B told me about a new coffee shop that's pretty close to where I live, I'm always up to checking out new places, so off we went to try out some coffee and sweets.\n\nThis place is spacious! Love the light fixtures, they are too cool, the wall deco is great too, I'm sure most would just come for the sweets & coffee, but this place has a nice relaxed vibe to it that you just want to go head and have your coffee there, and just relax for a minute.\n\nAfter checking out the pastries on display I went with the chocolate vanilla bean cupcake and a salted brulee latte. The cupcake was heavenly, the buttercream frosting was just the right amount of vanilla, and the cupcake was moist and perfect. The winner though was the Salted Brulee Latte, oh that is a great latte, the torched of the sugar on top with the warm rich coffee below, it's a cup of heaven I tell you!\nGlad to have found a new coffee spot in my hood, I'm sure I will be back plenty of times
