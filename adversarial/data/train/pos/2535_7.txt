I'm really teetering between 3.5 and 4 stars.\n\nSo, my fiance's mom & aunt are gamblers. Atlantic City gamblers. Yep, they're serious. And they've got these \"diamond club\" cards that get them free shit in all of the Harrah's hotels. This equals sweetness for all of us. We got FREE rooms (in the newly remodeled side), FREE drinks, front of the line service for cabs & restaurants in the Flamingo, etc. \n\nThe hotel itself is oldy Mc oldster...but that's kind of cool. Knowing the old skool gangsters used to roam the floors here is nifty.....BUT because it's old, the ventilation sucks balls. My eyes were so red that it looked like I'd smoked enough weed to put Bob Marley to shame. Really gross. The rooms, however, seemed to be smoke-free. They were clean, newly remodeled & had large flat panel TVs. My beef with the TVs was this: you turn them on and they would reset the volume level to oh, I dunno, level 4,000!! SO FUCKING LOUD & ridiculous. Don't they normally set them to be lower in volume? Whatever....the decor in the room looked like a futuristic Baskin Robbins. I know it's the Flamingo and you're gonna see fucking PINK everywhere you look, that's fine. But did they need to put white vinyl headboards in the room? Why vinyl?? I suppose it's easier to clean jizz off......eeeeeeew HAHA. Ok, back to the rest of the room. The beds were very comfy, there was ample hanging & drawer space, an iPod hookup & the bathroom was spacious and had separate bath & shower. If you can get past the Flamingo pink everywhere, you might like it.\n\nI will say this: I had some of my best luck gambling at the Flamingo. I rode my $20 for TWO days there....playing my Wheel of Fortune spinner game. Yeah, that's how I roll. Big time.
