A girl named Maria owns it. I would love to Ave Maria, but she's already married and I stopped having affairs with married people years ago due to death threats.\n\nWhat to get: The sausage omgzzzzz.\nWhat else: The guava drink is special\n\nThere's a bit of a wait here, but my goodness is it worth it. Easily one of the best meals I've ever had in Canada, eh. This is Venezuelan food, and is closer to street food than fancy food. The prices are not bad at all, and one of their heavenly Chorizo sausages with the bits of arepa and amazing sauce slathered all over it will fill you up for under ten Canadian.\n\nThen you just need to order their incredible authentic Jugos on the side, which are blended fruit drinks - I get mine without milk but it's up to you. The Guava is off-the-charts perfect. I can't speak to the others but I bet they are amazing too.\n\nLovely service, a nice family-owned place with all kinds of Venezuelan delights that will thrill you as much as it will satisfy your hunger. Anyone who lives in or visits Toronto and hasn't been here, has really been missing out.\n\n...\n\nSorry I had to go and Latin the cat. He was scratching at the door.\n\nAnyway, give this sausage and guava drink a try, and you will be sure to Ave a lovely meal. If that sausage were a girl, I'd Maria. Well assuming she said yes when I proposed to her. And if the sausage were a guy, well... yeah.
