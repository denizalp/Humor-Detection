I was in a rush to get to my next flight. Would it be worth it to step into this giant line? \n\nThe foodie in me could not resist in the end... i stepped into the line. I only had 20 minutes before the plane was boarding. LUCKILY it was right next to my gate. \n\nAs I was sitting in line, I noticed there was an order kiosk that nobody was using. I know- these things are slightly sinister in that they replace people with machines... but man i was late. So i punched in my order. Took about 15 minutes for the food to come out. \n\nBUT WOW. what a gargantuan burger. It was wrapped in foil and looked a little bigger than a softball. It was huge, with really nice bread. Great bacon. Cheesy. Messy. \n\nAND FRIENDS. I ate it in 4 minutes. It was the most euphoric 4 minute in an airport that I have had. \n\nAlso... uh. Are the two other reviewers really arguing about the type of ketchups? What about the burger? And why would you need to add ketchup to the master piece of a burger they give you? \n\nMake sure to get a lot of napkins. You will need them.
