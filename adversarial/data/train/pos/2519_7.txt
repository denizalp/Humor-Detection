Was looking for a new groomer, and based on all the positive reviews we decided to try this place out. \n\nWe walked in and the facility smelled so good! The wall decor was cute. There's a bench to sit and read magazines if you would like to wait there. It's very clean, inviting, and clutter free. \n\nBrought the little lion (Pekingese) in for a nail trim ($7), that's all he needed at the moment. We came in as a walk-in (around 10am on a Friday) and because they weren't busy they took him in immediately. This was our first time here and he got nervous...but they were so caring and great with him. \n\nAlex and the woman helping us was very knowledgeable, passionate and intuitive about what they were doing. You could hear it in their voices, how they spoke to the animals, how they spoke to us and to customers over the phone. They were caring and gentle with him. They calmed him down and talked him through the process. They also informed us that they only cut to a certain point of the nail to build trust and so he will be more comfortable cutting his nails the next time he comes in. They truly care about the animals and it shows. \n\nThey offer affordable a la carte services, full services as well with blueberry facials. The full service comes a cute tie! \n\nThey sell natural snacks made in the USA, cute outfits, ropes, harnesses and other goodies. Most items were a few bucks cheaper than the larger pet stores around town.  \n\nWe have found our new groomer and happy that it's in our area. We will definitely be back again for grooming, treats, and other goodies.\n\n***Note: There are other pet groomers in this shopping plaza, so make sure you go to the right one!
