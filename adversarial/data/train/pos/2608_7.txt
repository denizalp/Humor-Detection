We love Star of India! So what are we doing to do about this??? We keep on coming back, because that's what we do, lol!  I go there to find my vegetarian heaven for lunch.  Their food is consistently good, their buffet line is well-kept, clean and well-lit.  Staff is very attentive, picking up used plates, serving beverages and offering more naan bread at will.  Today was crowded for a Tuesday lunch, l am glad to see their popularity grow! This is a five rocking Star of India!
