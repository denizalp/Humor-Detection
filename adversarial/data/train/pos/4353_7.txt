A bunch of assholes in Security, I was trying to get the bell desk and typed in \"673\".. Instead, since their phones are so damn outdated, it went to 7 (which was security) and they ask \"Security, what's your emergency\" I said \"there is no emergency, I need a bell man\". The guy at security gave me this long sigh like he was upset and I'm like \"it's not my fault your phones are f*cked up.\"\n\nI swear, getting free rooms is NOT worth it sometimes when you get sh*tty ass service. It's to be expected here, I guess... \n\nOh, and if you don't put up your \"Do Not Disturb\" sign, housekeeping will come at 0730, knock once, and come RIGHT in. It's noisy at night too. Don't stay here.
