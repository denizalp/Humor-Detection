What a great experience on High Street! We had never been here before. There were many restaurants to choose from. We were in a pizza kind of mood so we decided to go to the Mellow Mushroom. Pizza was great, especially since they have dairy free, gluten free, and vegetarian options. Afterwards we sauntered over to grab some frozen yogurt where we discovered they have an almond milk cappuccino flavored yogurt. How delicious that was! The music was wonderful and the whole evening experience was so much fun! Thank you Yelp!
