Very disappointing.  For such a youthful city bustling with hip, energetic restaurants and bars, this place was a little stodgy, but a favorite among disappointed parents and their adult children who regrettably agreed to meet them for dinner.  The two dishes that stood out as most memorable?\n\nBone marrow - steamed, not roasted.  Boring, bland and a little gross.  Cut it lengthwise and roast it the way our paleo ancestors did!\n\nOctopus Salad - again, flavorless.  Both the texture and the taste of the Octopus and the Lentils absolutely did not compliment each other.
