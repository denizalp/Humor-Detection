This is the kind of place I consider not recommending to others but keeping as a secret to myself ... like one might do for a favourite fishing spot.  \n\nThe folks at Formula Auto are just great.  They treat customers like they've known you for a long time, even if you have just met.  I think they do that so they know you will come back.  And I have.  More than a few times.\n\nFormula Auto pricing seems to be based on actual \"effort\" and not what some flat rate that a book suggests they can get away with.  \n\nAnd Ken and the crew have good practical suggestions.   Their recommendations are based on experience and not based on a service manual that says this or that services needs to be performed in every so many kilometers, often at huge expense, but on actual wear and tear on the car they can show you and what actually needs to be fixed!!!  \n\nMany places turn up their noses if your car happens to be a bit older.  Not Formula Auto.  My 10 year old car is treated as well as one that is just new off the new car lot.\n\nAmazingly they have also been able to source parts for me at great prices.   And if there is some service they don't ordinarily do themselves, like replacing a windshield, they will recommend you to a great place that does windshields at reasonable prices too.  \n\n(They seem to have a \"friend\" in nearly every trade ... LOL.)\n\nWhile driving home from their shop yesterday I felt good about the service I received and thought what might I do to \"pay it forward\" ... So I most heartily recommend Formula Auto.
