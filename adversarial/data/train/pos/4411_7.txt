Simply beautiful.\n\nThe fountain will dance accordingly to the song that played.\n\nI always spend time watching it everytime I got chance to visit las vegas. \nIts a free entertainment after all.\n\nFor $250k, you could go to the private room and control what songs you want the fountain to play.\nI think this is really a rip-off and marketing gimmick.\nWho on earth really pay to become fountain's song operator?\nI really hope those people put their money somewhere else that more useful.
