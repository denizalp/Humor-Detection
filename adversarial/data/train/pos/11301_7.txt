Pretty strange experience. Ordered a mango tree one year ago or longer. Asked how long for the wait after 2-3 months. Short answer 4 weeks was the reply. That was in 2016. I sent another email and no reply. Now it is 2017.  Not sure what kind of business they are running. I guess they need that $50 more than me.  Surprising that this type of business can even survive this long. I doubt it. Good luck to those who do business with him. So many others places to go shop. Got my other tree in 2 weeks. This place is Pretty weak in comparison. Never will I buy again from him or whatever shop he is running. Cheers
