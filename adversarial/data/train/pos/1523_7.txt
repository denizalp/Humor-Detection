If I could give a negative review I would.  During our stay, I originally posted a review for this place and gave it four stars, but a combination of things that happened, especially on our last night, have compelled me to reduce that rating.\n\nFirst, I called in early June to check rates.  Was told $60 per night double occupancy, with 30$ additional per person charge per night for extra people.  I claimed that was too pricey for me traveling with my wife and three kids, so they said \"oh, we can waive the additional per person fee\".  Great, I made my reservation and got a confirmation email.\n\nDuring our subsequent road trip, I called two days in advance to reserve a roll away extra bed.  I was told there was \"no record\" of them agreeing to waive the fee, so I would have to pay an additional $90 per night for my three kids, and an additional $30 per night for one roll away bed.   I explained the offer to waive the fee, and that I had a confirming email, but the person on the phone basically called me a liar, said it was my problem, and offered to get her supervisor.  I proceeded to wait 27 minutes on hold before hanging up and calling back.  Never did talk to a supervisor.\n\nWhen I called back, second person was more pleasant, and helpful, confirmed fee was waived and took care of me.  So even though at this point I had spent about 2 hours on the phone with this place, I gave a good review because I thought they had done a good job taking care of me.  Not so fast.\n\nOur stay was ok, until the last night.  We had a wake up call at 5:30 AM so we could travel back home.  Unfortunately, maintenance decided to start replacing the vending and ice machines right outside our room at 3:00 AM.  After we were all awakened by the banging and pounding, I went out and asked them why they were working so loudly at 3 AM.  Guy responds \"that is just when we do it, too bad if you don't like it, we will be done soon\".  As someone who has actively practiced martial arts for a number of years, and still does practice, I fought off the almost overwhelming urge to pound his face through the wall.  I take my sleep very seriously.  So I opted to just tell him he was an A$$.\n\nI call front desk but cant get anyone.  I call hotel operator, who says she will call supervisor and get them to stop.  That never happened.  Well, after listening to this another hour, I finally get through to someone at the front desk, who apologizes and offers to reduce our bill by $75.  I thank they them, and we get up and get on our way (at this point why try to go back to sleep for like 15 minutes).\n\nSo, then we get home and a \"final bill\" is emailed to us showing a charge of $175 more than we were originally quoted, and no indication of any $75 credit.  I call, spend another half an our on hold, finally get a person, who tells me \"That is just a mistake, dont worry about it\".   She sent me a receipt with an adjustment.\n\nSo, did they take care of us?  Yes.  But all the hassles and being woken up at 3 AM were just too much.  I will NEVER STAY HERE again.  Be forewarned, and stay at your own risk.
