i would have rather had Tacos' De Juarez to be honest.\n\ni was completely left unimpressed. i would rate this place lower if the food wasn't at least decent. i was going to rate it 3 stars but after reliving all my greivences in my head i need to put it down to two. i will come back for another try sometime..better luck then. on to my review...\n\ni shared the rib eye tacos with my friend which tasted great, the meat was rare as requested, but what annoyed me is we were given a bowl of whole beans in a soup instead of mashed frijoles like another guest who ordered tacos. where is the consistency here? the molded rice tower was interesting for plating. the rice had good flavor and didn't seem as blown out as other mexican restaurant rices i have had.  i also tried the lobster quasadilla. i was tragicly disapointed. it was void of flavor, and the sauce on top was not very appealing when i tasted it on it's own. the inside was mushy...but not in a mushy melted cheese way. it was just mushy.\n\nservice was mediocre, guests who ordered drinks were left waiting 20 minutes without them. the place was dead last night so there is no excuse of being overwhelmed. i ordered a Dos XX's draft and it tasted flat, so my second drink i opted for a can of PBR. umm 3.50 for a can of PRB is hilarious. i can get a 12 pack at safeway for 5 something i think.\n\nlast on my gripe list...originally i ordered duck tacos..she took the order, and then came back to tell me they didn't have them. shouldn't the servers know this? the kitchen staff needs to let servers know what is out before they start taking orders. if when i ordered the duck tacos she said \"i'm sorry we are actually out of duck tonight\" i would have been ok.. and ordered something else or asked to be skipped till everyone else had ordered. instead i get to have her come back with menus and tell me \"sorry we are out of duck tacos\". (:-\\) no bueno!\n\n\n\nPadre's you want to play yourself off as semi upscale mexican restaurant charging 15$ for 3 small tacos. service and atmosphere isn't deserving of your priceing. at least put my PBR in a glass instead of serving it to me in a can.\n\n\nin conclusion, i will give Padres another shot. but i am in no hurry to return.
