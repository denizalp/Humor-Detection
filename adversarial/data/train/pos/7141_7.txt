After not seeing the amazingly talented Chef Desyree since February, I finally made a trek to her new \"home\" far far away in the same strip mall where Serenade is located.\n\nWe were warmly greeted by Desyree as soon as we walked in. We got to try almost all of her wonderful products: macarons, gelato, sorbetto, and marshmallows. She also has biscuits, chocolate barks, honeycomb, coconut macaroons, and drink concoctions.\n\nGelato\/Sorbetto:\nSome flavors change daily\/almost daily, and there are mainstays. Flavors like avocado, olive oil, Yuzu, Nutella, fruit smoothie, pina colada, peach and Gorgonzola, Japanese green tea Kit Kat, gingerbread, bananas foster, fior Di latte, cookies and cream, chocolate, peanut butter, etc. Desyree makes her gelato\/sorbetto fresh everyday. She has sweet frozen treats and savory frozen sweets. Get yours in a cup or cone. The cups come in 4 sizes. I like trying new flavors with my staple: Nutella! 5\/5\n\nMarshmallows:\nThese are not the commercialized white fluff in a plastic bag at the grocery store. These are semi-dense tiny blocks of good marshmallows that come in flavors like Nutella, vanilla, peppermint, and orange. Even Filipino flavors like ube (purple yam), and pandan. I've tried the different flavors and they were all very good but the one I brought home were the Nutella marshmallows 5\/5\n\nI also got Nutella sea salt biscuits, Nutella hazelnut truffles, and a Nutella macaron. So, basically, anything with Nutella that was available that day, I got and tried to eat all of them. Yuuuuummmm!!!
