Renaysha M. I hope you are reading this. \n\nMy last 3 visits to this location were horrific. Get a grip, Dunkin. Close up shop, and move to a different location, and hire employees who aren't lazy and rude.  I got her name off my receipt. \n\nFirst off, I was greeted in the drive through by someone who seemed to be side tracked by something, because she kept laughing in the middle of me ordering. To make matters worse,  she proceeded to have me REPEAT MY ORDER ---I just got an iced coffee and a green tea--- 4 times until she got it...which ended up coming out wrong. I pull around to the window and start reaching into my purse for my Wallet, meanwhile Renaysha (our cashier)  stood there laughing and giggling with her friends (I would like to say, I am all for fun in the work place), My friend  who was in the car with me, said \"oh, I think she is waiting on you\" I look over, and she walks away. Another girl came to the window and started handing me our things, and Renaysha proceeded  to say \" She  hasn't paid yet, because she wasn't f****** paying attention!\"  I stopped and said \"Excuse me? I hope she's not talking about me\".... and the girl who was handing our things took my money, and did not say a WORD.  Meanwhile, I can hear  Renaysha talking about me and my friend! Calling us white trash B******.  I asked to speak to a manager, but was told that \"they were busy\"... I was never rude to her when giving my order, despite  having to repeat it.  I've worked drive thru for a fast food chain when I was 15, I know microphones for those can pick up everything or become static easily... I gave her the benefit of the doubt, and continued to be nice.   There was absolutely nothing that warranted that kind of behavior.  \n\nI immediately called the manager, who did nothing for me. I'm not looking for free things, I just think someone like that needs to know, that this is NOT OKAY.  The Manager didn't seem too interested in dealing with it either.  AWESOME.\n\nHowever, on the bottom of my receipt, I can tell Dunkin my opinion and I will be doing so....and with that...I will get a free Coffee.  \n\nStay classy, Renaysha.
