So normally I wouldn't write a review about a fast food restaurant but this evening as we were here there were two extremely young,  scantly clothed drunk teen girls in the restaurant. It appeared that the girls were friends of the employees as they spoke to them by their names.  As their asses hung out of their short,  shorts,  the girls ran around obviously intoxicated taking selfies and laughing about how they don't drink. I'm sorry but if this is your place of employment and your friends are intoxicated and acting like fools, they should be asked to leave.  Not a family environment!
