I stopped by for lunch and like my experience at a previous Pieology location I wasn't impressed. When I walked in they were very busy and I waited in line about 10 minutes to place my order and about another 10 minutes to receive my pizza. I've dealt with this type of wait at Blaze Pizza however the employees are friendly at Blaze and don't hurry you through the line like here at Pieology. I wanted ricotta on my pizza, but after seeing it I changed my mind. The ricotta looked not fresh like it had been there a long time and there was tons of other pizza toppings on top of the ricotta. I know it gets busy and when grabbing different toppings while making a pizza they sometimes drop stuff in different areas, but it needs to be controlled and cleaned! I also noticed the lack of toppings offered compared to Blaze and wished they had more options for cheese like the ovalini mozzarella that Blaze has. I only saw one option for pizza crust while Blaze offers a high-rise crust option. Yes I am comparing the two pizza places a lot because they are trying to accomplish the same type of fast casual pizza experience yet both have differences. \n\nCustom Pie ($7.99) - The custom pie allows you to be creative and top your pizza to your liking all for one price. I chose shredded mozzarella, mushroom, pepperoni and pineapple. I only ate half of my pizza before trashing it because it had such a weird taste, mostly burnt. The toppings were completely uneven, the pepperoni was mostly all in the center of the pizza. The crust was so burnt especially around the edges. I don't get the hype for this place. At all. What they call pizza here is nothing more than a extra burnt thin cracker with cheese and toppings. Seriously, just take a saltine cracker, torch the sides and bottom, melt cheese on it and you'll have a Pieology pizza. I'll stick with Blaze Pizza on Decatur.
