My favorite groomer for my little dog!!! Way better than Petsmart. Valerie & the staff are so nice. It's also very quick. My dog is usually in & out in about an hour so I just stay in the area & go to Cafe Rio & Von's. Super pleased with the results each time. Each time I try something new & it always turns out good.\n\n**update: Valerie is the only groomer to ever point out my dog has a problem with her nails. They grow extremely fast & she has a very thick quip, which can make walking painful if her nails are long. This was due to owners in the past not getting her nails trimmed. I now come in every two weeks to get her nails cut, which will start to make her quip more manageable. :) I'm glad Valerie pointed this out to me.
