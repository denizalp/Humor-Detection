Hey! You! You love Costco, buying in bulk, 200 rolls of tp at a time! This Costco is exactly what you expect, a nice clean store with friendly staff! I love shopping here and checking out all the great seasonal items they have! I wish they had Otis and spunkmeyer cookies but I guess that is only a Pacific Northwest thing. The store is constantly rotating items and with all the Christmas gear in stock it's a great place to go for all your needs. Now stop reading this, why are you still reading go to Costco, get your 1.50 hot dog and soda then try to escape without spending 100 bucks! Good luck!
