The former space of a long-time art dealer has been usurped by a cabal of young bohemians with a passion for the almighty grinder, the sensational submarine, the hallowed hero, the zealous zep, and the bulk of their craft is scratch-made from the bread to the roast beef. \n\nIt was the latter that had me salivating, particularly when I was told that there would be a wait since the protein in question was still cooking and the just-baked bread was cooling. \n\nWhile the meat ended up being slightly dry, I savored the fresh, flaky bread, the artistically laid array of vegetables ( I went berserk with my choices), and the \"Jersey Style\" vinegar\/oil\/salt\/oregano dressing which was what truly shot the torpedo across the ocean and into Jared Fogle's yacht. One hearty hoagie, my only lament was that I didn't go with an Italian since I feel it probably would have been more succulent.\n\nA cup of potato salad proved to be a starchy, creamy success with a bit of celery bringing the crunch. The M&M chocolate chip cookies we had for dessert were crispy, chewy caps of joy that rivaled those of many area bakeries. \n\nI must add that the interiors are bright, contemporary, and inviting, the soda fountain is self-serve, the employees are enthusiastic and engaging, and the meat is sliced to order. \n\nSubway sinks to the ocean floor to be devoured by a Kraken as Blimpie's falls burning from the sky.  The age of Lebo Subs is upon us.
