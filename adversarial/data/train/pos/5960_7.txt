I stayed at the Palazzo this past weekend. The hotel was beautiful. Each room at the hotel is a suite, and the bathrooms are huge! I found a few random items in our hotel room that led me to believe it wasn't the cleanest. I found a pair of jeans in the drawer, and penis confetti around the bed. Whoever stayed there before me must have had a good time. The Palazzo is connected to Venetian and a bunch of shops which can entertain you for hours. Most of the shops are high-end and they're also various restaurants throughout the hotel. The hotel itself is humongous, the rooms are very nice, and the casino is fun, I just wish they were cleaned with more detail.
