I'm pretty biased since Im a huge gambler, but this place is so much fun! Maybe not so much when you lose money, which seems to be a common theme for most, but when you win a race its the coolest feeling. And you don't even need to bet much to feel good about your win. You can bet for as little as 2 dollars on each bet and watch those horses run as your heart beats faster and faster till they hit that finish line!\nProbably not the best place if you have a heart condition, but Ive seen many people at  this place on oxygen tanks, so what do i know?\nIf your looking for a fun, different night out -- have a few bucks to spare (or even if you don't and dont mind going into over draft like me - woot) and love horsies, come check it out!
