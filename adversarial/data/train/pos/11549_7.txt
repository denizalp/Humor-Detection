This will be a short review... when BWW came out, I really liked their wings. But over the years it seems like they've moved into cooking their wings and then just splashing sauce on them as you order them. This is OK, so long as you know this is what you are getting.\n\nIf you go with children be sure to see if they have any of their gaming systems available. They are good to keep the kids entertained while you eat or watch a game.\n\nOn a side note - I am allergic to the Caribbean Jerk. LOL.
