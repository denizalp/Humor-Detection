The plants and prices are good, mostly. But I have never been treated so rudely in my life. We asked for help and were sent to a far-away part of the complex to see Kelly. When we found her, she angrily let us know she was tied up and would not be available all day. She marched us back to the guy who sent us to her and chewed him out while we stood there. then the owner, Bill, arrived and we asked him for help. I had talked to him on the phone and he said he could do a landscape plan for us. I brought photos and a plat, which I gave to him. I mentioned that we'd had root rot which had been treated. He asked me what was used and I didn't know. He was angry and told me I SHOULD know! He asked who did it and I said the name of a well-known tree company. He dismissed this, saying he'd never heard of them. He went on to berate me for not knowing the name of the treatment. He was actually angry with me! I put my hand on his arm and asked him to calm down so we could talk about the plan. With this, he shoved my papers back at me, walked off and said in a sarcastic voice, \"have a nice day\". I stood there, stunned, and turned to the guy who'd just been chewed out by Kelly. He had tears in his eyes and apologized. I was just shocked and not sure what has just happened. I may buy from them again, but I will never set foot in the place, I'll send someone else. Their treatment of me was abusive and that's not okay in my world.
