As far hostels go I don't think you can go any better then this. The place if big, clean, well equipped. The place have the original woodwork and stained glass. The only con, no AC as far as I saw. If you have been 8 in a room, you know it can be a problem. The included breakfast is composed of toast, jelly, peanut butter and coffee. They give real butter, real butter, not margarine.
