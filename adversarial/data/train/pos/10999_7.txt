Even though I changed my membership so I can go to any other 24 Hr Fitness in the Valley, I still come here.....bad habits are hard to break I guess.  This morning was especially frustrating, here's why:\n\n- The gym is freakin' cold....I get that you need ventilation to cool off, but why does it have to be FREEZING in there?!  Doesn't make any sense at all....my muscles get stiff after a solid workout and it's just too damn uncomfortable.  Complaining to the staff doesn't do any good because they tell you it's controlled by the Corporate Office in California....yeah right.\n\n- The personal trainers today were really annoying.  One of them had one of their clients doing situps in the middle of the freakin' aisle where the front row of elliptical machines were.....seriously, there's a private room for the personal trainers that's empty 99% of the time....why they insist on being jerks to the rest of the members like this is beyond me.  Another one of them hung their sweatshirt on the bar of one of the bench presses while they had their client do a workout nearby......which tied up the bench press because people didn't know if someone was working out on the press and would be right back or what the deal was.....these personal trainers here have no sense of gym ettiquette.\n\nI'm not one to make New Year's resolutions, but I think my resolution will be to finally get away from this place and go to the Centennial 24 Hr Fitness location.  The problem is, it will probably have some of these problems too.\n\nWill I return?  I hope not, but old habits are tough to break.
