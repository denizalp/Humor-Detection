this is the perfect spot for last minute cheap club clothes! there are soooo many clothes and the store is organized entirely by color! YAY! i would envision it fairly impossible for one to come in here and not find at least one great, did i say cheap, item!!! \n\nso this past weekend i was in major need of something to wear out saturday night. i decided to pack too light and didn't have anything to wear. meh. i didn't want to hit the forum shops because i know myself well enough to know that i'd drop some serious bucks. so we decided to hit up q mode for the sake of cheapness. that is where i found my little black dress for a mere $10! YES i make you holla fo only ten dolla! :D i walked out of q mode with two tank tops and a dress and only spent $20! HAZAH!
