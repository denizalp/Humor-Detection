We...Love...South Point!  \nThis place is at the far end of the strip closest to Primm.  If you take a cab, you are on the middle of the strip in 5 minutes.  South Point has everything you need from fair slots to table games that aren't too expensive to play.  The restaurants are very good and not too pricey. The rooms are spacious, well appointed and super comfortable.  The nice thing about South Point is that it is, in my most humble Yelpinion, the best hotel in Vegas if you are taking the kids!  Yeah, I said that.  There is plenty of stuff from a full sized movie theater to an arcade, to a cool pool area for the kids.  The restaurants and staff are ready to serve families and do it well.  \n\nDid I mention they always have great prices and specials going on?  \n\nWhat happens in Vegas stays in Vegas. Who stays at South Point, love it and stay again!
