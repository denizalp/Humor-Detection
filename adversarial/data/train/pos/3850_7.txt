HORRIBLE!  This place is a scam that preys upon women walking through the mall having just left the casino.  My wife, who is very-conservative, not an impulse-buyer and is a stay at home mother of three got TAKEN for $1,994.37 of their snake oil.  Ultimately it's her fault, but she and the other women with here that also buy product, we subjected to an intense-high pressure and lengthy sales \"presentation\"  The other thing is they're telling her, now that she's home, embarrassed and I'm PISSED beyond belief, is that non of it is returnable.  This sort of business practice is disgusting.  I haven't decided what I'm going to do yet but she's not opening any more boxes of it until I decide.
