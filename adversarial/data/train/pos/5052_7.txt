Ladies and gentlemen, I have discovered the anti-Scottsdale! People are laid back and nice! \n\nPay your $8 to get in. It's really steep if there's not much action, but consider it an investment in having a good time. I was here on a Friday, and so I was fortunate to indulge in 50 cent well drinks. Beyond that, they had bud light lime and three olives bubblegum, so I was in a happy place!\n\nStaff: Super friendly, and not pretentious. Even the bouncers were way nice, glad to see people having a good time instead of looking for trouble.\n\nLadies: Quite a variety. I noticed a lot of cougars, but overall I must say everything you could be looking for is here. \n\nGuys: Not much of a variety, and the guys were a bit on the trashy side. *I* felt like I was overdressed, and I'm not even a fancy guy. They seem a bit ghetto here, but I guess that just makes me stand out more? I like that. \n\nThis place really seems like a laid-back, no drama club. A place people can have fun and not be judged...well except for me. I get to judge; it's a Yelper's duty. :-p
