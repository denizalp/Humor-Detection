I like this place because they have a good selection, yes some things are expensive and some are very reasonable.  The only issue I see with this place is a lot of items do not have a price on them so you don't really know what you are paying for the product you want.\n\nWe picked up a package of bacon which was on the shelf with a price of $4.99 in front of it which you could barely see.  There were no other prices on the package or around all the same packages.  When we got to the register, that package was actually $10...\n\nThe have a lot of employees working around the store stocking shelves, you would think they would take the time to make sure all items are properly marked with the correct price, OR DO THEY??? \n\nAnyway, its close to the house and some items you can get organic for cheaper at other places but overall its ok.  The free sample trays they have spread out throughout the store is nice except they sometimes put them in the middle of an isle and you cannot get through with a cart, so that is not very good planning either.
