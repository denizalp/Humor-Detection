Sigh... my mama taught me -- if you don't have anything nice to say, don't say anything at all.  \n\nI have plenty of nice things to say about Tim Hortons.  i also have good things to say about Tim Horton's in Riverbend.  However, I do have some constructive feedback.\n\nThe short story, is I am a regular here.  I am in this Tim Horton's a few times a week to get my breakfast sandwich and the delicious, DELICIOUS coffee that they serve.  I will continue to go there regardless.  The staff are famililar and are friendly.  On the whole, I have little to complain about.\n\nExcept....\n\nIn my observation and opinion, I do not beleive they have enough staff on.\n\nThere it is.  I said it.\n\ni work downtown, and have seen the well oiled machine of Tim Hortons, where the lineups are literally out the door and around the corner.  It looks hopeless!  But I still have my coffee and my sandwich within 10 minutes.  Its a modern Tim Horton's miracle.\n\nin Riverbend, this is not generally the case.  Sadly, I am conditioned that if I have time, I get my cofffee and breakfast at Riverbend.  if I am running a tad bit behind, I drive downtown, and get my Timmy's downtown.\n\nSad, isn't it?\n\nI will continue to give this location my business.  However, the sad truth, is that they can use more staff in the mornings.  There are times when no one is at the till, because all the cashiers are filling sugar, pouring coffee, or running into the back to grab something.  This location would be a 5-star Timmy's if their cashiers did nothing but cash, and kept the assembly line going.
