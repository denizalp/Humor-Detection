I'm very excited to be sharing this brand new local business on Yelp...\nLocal owners Roger and Brooke Cahill invested a ton of thought, money, blood, sweat and likely tears into this neighborhood fitness center, and it shows.  The facility itself offers state-of-the-art equipment - both cardio and strength training.  They've created a welcome and friendly environment, and there is plenty of parking in a very convenient location off of 44th Street and Indian School.\n\nAccording to Merriam-Webster, the definition of aptitude is:\n    1\n    a :  inclination, tendency an aptitude for hard work\n    b :  a natural ability :  talent an aptitude for gymnastics\n\n    2 :  capacity for learning an aptitude for languages\n\nPretty fitting considering if you go to this gym, you're expecting to work hard and learn... \n\nI've trained with Roger for the past 4 years and I can say with confidence that he is amazing at what he does.  He knows his stuff.  He knows the human body and he is an expert in his field.  In that time, I never had the same workout.  Roger mixes it up and push your limits in a good way!  When Roger told me that he and Brooke were opening their own place, there wasn't a question if I would follow them and support them.\n\nThe saying on the wall (and tagline for the business) is \"Ready. Sweat. Go.\" Very fitting... that is exactly what you will do when you step foot into Aptitude Performance Center!  \n\nI know Roger and Brooke are getting the class schedule (strength and conditioning) and personal training schedule off the ground now, so check this place out sooner than later before they are too packed... if you do so early in the mornings like me, I may just see you there!
