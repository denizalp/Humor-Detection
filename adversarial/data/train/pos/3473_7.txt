What a blessed weekend of wrong-turns this was! A birthday dinner with my parents and sister was due to close out the weekend...\n\nhttp:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=gTCi0InNH7w\n\nOnce again, I was having difficulty choosing a restaurant. Dad doesn't like to go out to eat and insisted on getting takeout from a place relatively close to home. After mulling it over all day, I chose Double Wide Grill for 3 reasons 1) It's controversial, and I just hadda see what the hub-bub was about. 2) I'd been craving BBQ, and it became too late to order from Yinzburgh, my original choice, and Bloomfield would have been too far; Dad didn't wanna cross the Monongahela. \n\nRiding with Dad to and from DWG was harrowing, particularly when we got onto the PJ McArdle Roadway...\n\nhttp:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=zUID-39p0oM\n\nDWG's rustic trailer park motif was in full effect, so much so that I forgot I was within the city limits as I awaited the large sack of food...\n\nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=0J3Fod7809s\n\nYet the clientage was diverse. Tattooed punksters dined and drank alongside elderly folk and families. It was surprisingly quiet despite Carson Street's usual... \n\nhttp:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=_adqQRTeiww\n\nA burly, bald fella of my father's age with a Roaring 20's moustache and arms like an ironworker rang me up and sent me on my way...\n\nhttp:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Xns8KFLx1X8\n\nBefore long 'twas...\n\nhttp:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=MMM0O86WivI\n\nI started out with a cup of their mess hall-greasy chili, and based on my picture, you can see the oil rising to the top. Despite that fattiness of the broth, this chili was chock full of supple pork, onions, and other vegetables, and beans were at a minimum. This is the manner of chili one would expect at a place called the Double Wide Grill, and for the most part, I found it to be a richly flavorful pot of...\n\nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=maMCAmj5gh8\n\nMy dinner consisted of a beef brisket sandwich and something DWG calls \"lug nuts\"...\n\nhttp:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=glIEwEcfLWI\n\nIf homefries knocked up tater tots, you'd get this tuber bastard child, a shotgun weddin' happenin' beforehand no doubt. And I relished these golden, crispy, starchy spud nuggets. \n\nAlso flaxen 'n flaky was Mum's dessert-ish cornbread that I was half-tempted to bury in whipped cream, vanilla ice cream, and strawberries after sampling. \n\nhttp:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=ZMdUy8-NpaY\n\nBessie's Best Bar-B-Q Brisket was a dream, and I wanted to take her for a cruise in a...\n\nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Jl3R6O2mJeQ\n\nThe brisket itself was steakhouse-prime. Juicy and thickly-cut, I drizzled the sugary liquid smoke of DWG's Memphis Sauce underneath Bessie's hot-buttered onion roll...\n\nhttp:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=QfnmhRgeUns\n\nShe was such the epitome of Southern goodness, I was doing the...\n\nhttp:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=AYIqQAHDCFk\n\nAlso filched from Mum was a few spoonfuls of her Creamy Cherry Cole Slaw that was as tasty, tangy, and toothsome as any I've ever had, the novel inclusion of cherries only furthering the picnic\/cookout theme in the face of February's icy blues...\n\nhttp:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=o7vFIm3qTo8\n\nDad allowed me a bite of his St. Louis Ribs. Wood-grilled, dry-rubbed, cooked low 'n slow, and slathered-then-cauterized with a zesty Carolina sauce, one has to wonder if any of the depressed BBQ devotees in the area have honestly given DWG's pig a try...\nhttp:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=KIXEzmIBpHw\n\nFrankly, it has me...\nhttp:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=IeeleWV6B7U\n\nThe bones almost slid out of the meat itself which was so tender, my late grandfather could have eaten these sans dentures! Regardless, this yankee thought they were damn fine. I could also say the same about the pulled pork my mother allowed to me to inspect with my teeth and palate. I'll probably be told that I need to visit the South someday, which I'd like to do, and I doubt I'd be disappointed, but damn it if we don't have some very good BBQ up North, DWG serving as a fine example...\n\nhttp:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Y4pOIndfTzI\n\nIf Kinky Friedman were to be reincarnated as an appetizer, he'd be the Reuben Egg Rolls. Like Gullifty's Crispy Reuben, this is a fun, cracklin', and delectable deep-fried take on an urban deli standard with its insulated, steamed corned beef, Swiss cheese, and sauerkraut almost evaporating on your tongue. Tell ya what, parboiled fat does somethin' to a Reuben, especially when its served with a dynamite chipotle-infused ranch dressing...\n\nhttp:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=iKv_YYzdI2w\n\nI dunno gang, I see no reason why I shouldn't give Double Wide Grill a 5. The grub was mouthwatering, the ambience and decor is a blast, the service was smooth, and they have a vegan menu, shattering stereotypes by injecting Bohemia with a beneficial dose of...\n\nhttp:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=3OhkNh0HRHo
