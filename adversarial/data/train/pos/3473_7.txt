The service typically leaves a little to be desired (slow and\/or distracted) BUT the food is ALWAYS tasty, healthy, and leaves me feeling satisified. Since the prices went up a couple years ago, I find the value-for-your-money isn't what it used to be but it's still reasonable given what I feel are quality ingredients.
