Looking for specific spices for bryani and this was the second location we checked. The place was bright and clean and we found what we were looking for easily.  Fresh naan and pita bread were stacked on bins and I couldn't resist buying some! Had a question and the man was very friendly. I would def come back when I have more time and peek around some more!
