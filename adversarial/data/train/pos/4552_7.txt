Other reviewers comments regarding the lackadaisical service were correct, these guys like to \"Sunday drive\" during the lunch rush.  I got pushed into a goat curry that was twice as expensive as the other lunch dishes and as bone laden as the Santa Maria della Concezione dei Cappuccini.  These two things aside the other items looked solid and the Naan was splendid.
