Shoddy, boring, inept.  For such a great property to serve such a lackluster Mothers Day brunch is a real disappointment.  No bagels (\"well you can put some cream cheese on some toast or a roll\" said the manager).  Crab legs served frozen solid (we can put them in the steamer for you - another great idea from the manager).\n\nNo thanks.  I was hoping for it to served the way it was intended: refreshingly chilled.\n\nTo his credit he offered to pay our brunch tab.  That's okay, we're comped anyway.  What would have gone a long way is an admittance to being short on supplies, and not lame excuses.  This is the Mirage, after all - and not some off-the-strip hotel's breakfast bar.\n\n2 stars for excellent beverage service served up by a delightful lady.  The rest was as empty and void as the scrambled eggs - of which there were none as well.
