yes.\n\nthis is definitely the club to be at. was a complete and utter zoo late saturday evening when we finally made it to the entrance....e v e r y o n e wants inside marquee. line around the building, and hundreds of others wrapped in a ring trying to bypass line with privileged entry. that was us :P\n\ni dont know how i did it...\n\nall i had was a name and \"the only guy with a goatee\" as identification for our tickets inside. and hello mr. facial hair! he made eye contact with me and i got us girls in at 1:30am. amazing....pays to be assertive when everyone else gives up! \n\n$20 cover :-\/\n\nand $50 for guys...the one couple who was with us opted to leave when they found that out.\n\nbut yes...i liked this place. really spread out areas, main dance floor and DJ that night were great (though stay there if you want to dance! we left and couldnt get back in because it reached capacity!)...outside female bartender amazingly friendly in dealing with the madness. you have to sign 2 receipts, interesting. I paid $30 for a shot and well drink. thats vegas.\n\nclubs are massively based on bais and personal preference, but i never wanted to leave, and thats my barometer of whether I enjoy a place or not. leaving at 4am was way too soon.
