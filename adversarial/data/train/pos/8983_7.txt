I remember coming in here on my very first day at my current job almost 6 years ago. Nervously (starting a new job is always stressful), I ate a few slices of pizza. \n\nWell, since no one has reviewed this place before (which shocks me since it's right on L-Ville's main drag) , and I had no memories of how good everything was, I decided to pop in again.\n\nI got an Italian hoagie and two slices of plain cheese pizza to take to work for my daily pre-shift late breakfast. \n\nA small pizza is 8 cuts I was told, so that was a no-go.\n\nThese were big, floppy New York sidewalk style slices. The crust was chewy and toasty and that sauce was excellent and sweet. I just wish the front of each slice didnt droop so much. They need more dough on the bottom or cook the bottom to a crisp to make it sturdier, but yeah, decent, decent pie. \n\nThe hoagie was a typical Burgh hoagie; crunchy bread, lots of fixins, a little stingy with the meat, and a generous amount of mayo on it.
