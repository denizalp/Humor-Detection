With a sudden craving for Thai and at a loss for somewhere close, my friends suggested Bangkok Thai which was in walking distance to their house. Honestly I was surprisingly impressed!!!! I know the saying \"don't judge a book by it's cover\" but I always ignored this little gem due to the random strip mall location. Then after my first bite I felt ashamed. I learnt my lesson. I am a repeat offender of the Pad Thai which you can order as is or with your desired level of spiciness added. Both are excellent. And I do have to say...the to-go portion is huge (optical illusion maybe but I think not...). As for the rest of the menu...friends and family have yet to be disappointed. \n\nLesson learned.
