Bellagio's upscale convenience store located right across from the main tower elevators and in the esplanade. If you have some money to drop and are looking to get some quick snacks, drinks, hard liquor and some souvenirs for those folks back home, then come to Tutto for all your basic essentials.\n\nYes this store is overpriced but that's aimed at tourists who have no where else to go from there hotel room and don't want to walk too far from the hotel to get what they need. If you don't want to pay a lot for water, snacks and etc, then I suggest to walk to the ABC store across from Bellagio in the Miracle Mile Mall in Planet Hollywood just to save some money and trust me. The prices in the ABC store will make you come back for more basic stuff and you can save some for the casino
