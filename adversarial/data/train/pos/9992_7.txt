A bunch of us went to Share last night to let loose!  Fridays are their Circus themed nights.  BOY DID THEY LET LOOSE!\n\nTo me, Share is transforming the gay scene in Vegas and doing a great job at it! This place offers a great nightclub experience.  There are gogo dancers everywhere.  The vibe is cool.  Lots of good looking people.  All in all I had a great time and a lot of fun!\n\nI don't quite like the location.  This trendy and upscale nightclub is located amongst and industrial area and soooo awkward.  Thank goodness they have free valet service.  \n\n***Be advised, Fridays get crazy at 1am and 2am.  Depends what you're going there for.  The gogo dancers, from what I was told are all imported from L.A. LOL. Definitely good looking, but they end up getting naked (covers up the front part) at 1 and 2.  I wasn't expecting it and since they're everywhere, it got super uncomfortable.  I'm all for having a great time, but wasn't looking for that kind of great time last night.\n\nI also do not like the upscale prices.  3 well drinks with tip came to $34.  Make sure you're looking to spend some money!\n\nI'm not your average caddy guy.  My rating is all about location and vibe.  Location was awkward but vibe and experience made up for it.  Last night I had some fun and will be back.
