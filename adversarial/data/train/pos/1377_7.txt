My business partner and I stop in here from time to time to meet and have a few drinks.  It's a beautiful property, but it was built at the wrong time.  It opened during the start of the recession and the area around it is full of foreclosures.....which means this place is always dead when we're here.\n\nDespite the low business volume, it's still a fun place to come.  The employees are friendly and you can always find a seat at the bar or get a table in a restaurant.  I don't think we've ever had to wait any more than a few minutes for a table.\n\nMy buddy likes to gamble and he loves the video poker machines here.  He's pretty lucky and says he's \"beating the house\".....yeah right.\n\nI really like how clean they keep this place, so I'm sure I'll be back.\n\nReturn Factor - 75%
