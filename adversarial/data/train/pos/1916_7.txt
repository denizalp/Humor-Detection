There is so much buried treasure in here! Being an avid hater of buffalo exchange, finding out about another second hand store within a couple blocks was amazing. \nNow, I've never sold anything to Sunset, but the one thing that I can say is that I'm NOT going to have some bitchy nineteen year old hipster buying my thirty dollar shirt for three bucks cash or ten bucks store credit. Screw your store credit. If I wanted a fifteen year old stussy shirt I'ld go to a garage sale in Mesa. \nThe selection at Sunset is very good, and you don't have to go sifting through a pile of hobo rags to find the goods. Also, it's all pretty reasonable priced and in almost new condition, not \"gently used by some shitty hobo\" condition. \nThat's not even what I really go there for. When I need a quick, totally awesome piece of jewelry that fit's my girlfriends style AND won't cost upwards of fifty or a hundred dollars, this is the holy land. Every time I've swung through casually looking for a gift, I find something more often than not that is better than what I was looking for. \nPeople really should shop here more. Not only for the great deals and selection, but also because the employees won't treat you like trash stuck to there yuppie, hipster, leather boots. Instead, you'll be treated like a nice person by some people that probably look like people that would wear yuppie, hipster, leather boots but really they have shiny, pretty, nice people leather boots on instead.
