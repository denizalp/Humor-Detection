I hate it when a business has a bunch of good reviews, and then there's that one, or maybe a very few bad ones...really makes you wonder...is this person a jerk, or what?  HINT:  CHECK THE RETURN\/REFUND POLICY CAREFULLY!  \nIf I could leave less than one star, I would, and here's why:  I needed a fairly heavy length of chandelier chain in a dark color and I was told that they would probably have it here; so I drove 30 miles one way, hoping to find what I needed.  They had something close enough, so I bought more than I thought I'd need, to make sure that I'd have plenty, since the electrician was at my house, ready to install the chandelier and I didn't want to have to come back. \nI got home, the electrician completed the installation, and all is right with the world.  But, I had a full length (three feet) and an 18\" remnant left over.  Like I said, I bought more than I thought I'd need, just in case.  \nSo I dug out the receipt and looked toward the bottom at the refund\/return policy.  It says (maybe not an exact quote, but close):  \"Returns within 7 days with receipt.\"  No problem, since we were going back that way in a couple of days anyway, we'll return the intact section (about $15.00 worth), and just give them the remnant...nice gesture I thought, and besides, I had no use for it. \nI walk in and the woman at the counter says can I help you?  I smiled, put the chain and receipt on the counter, and said \"Yes, I bought one section too many, and you can have the remnant.\"  She scowled like I'd just insulted her firstborn and STABBED a finger at the receipt on the counter saying:  \"FINAL SALE!\"  I said, what?  \"FINAL SALE!!\" she repeated, about 50 decibels higher.  Confident, I said, \"But, it says right here, returns within 7 days with receipt.\"  \"FINAL SALE!!!\" she almost yells at me, again stabbing her finger on the receipt.  So I look, and sure enough, it says in rather small red letters, FINAL SALE.  I'd not noticed that before, but why would I?  You expect a sale to be final if it's a clearance, seasonal, discount, or whatever...but not a normal retail (and overpriced at that) off the shelf sale...makes no sense to me. \nSo I said to her (and no, I didn't take the bait and raise my voice) \"Really, are you kidding me?\"  She gave me another scowl and looked away.  WOW, this woman makes the wicked witch of the west look like June Cleaver...what is her problem?  \nSo I said, not so much to her, but any other customers who might be listening (and there were a couple of them), \"...so which of the policies printed on your receipts do you abide by, or do you pick and choose?\"\nBottom line?  I won't go back, ever.  No customer should ever be treated like this.  She could have conveyed the same message in a decent, respectful way, and although I might not have been thrilled about it, I could have dealt with it.\nSo yes, in all fairness, they have a bunch of stuff there, and if you need something that they have go for it...just make sure that you clearly understand which return policy they're using that day.
