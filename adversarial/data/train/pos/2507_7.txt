Babystacks is a great breakfast place with awesome pancake options and island influence. The service is good, the portions are filling, and the price is just right.\n\nI recommend the Two-Egg Breakfast. It's great for the indecisive diner, who has trouble choosing between a sweet or savory breakfast. And for only $6.25, you can get both in the form of two eggs cooked any style, potatoes or rice, and a small stack of pancakes or toast. And as president of the hypothetical potato fan club, I'm definitely an advocate on behalf of these potatoes. These potatoes are well-seasoned, slightly crispy, but remain wonderfully fluffy in the center. And even though rice is life, that's my shit. \n\nAs for pancake recommendations, I definitely recommend the strawberry pancakes. While the other pancakes are delicious, I find them overwhelmingly sweet and tap out after a few bites. But I NEVER get sick of the strawberry pancakes. Not only are they a classic flavor combination, the syrup tastes fresh and feels like the perfect counterweight to the pancakes.\n\nOverall, Babystacks is definitely one of my favorite breakfast diner options!
