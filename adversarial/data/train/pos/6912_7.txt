Dive Bar: A dive bar is a type of bar or pub.\nDive bars generally have a relaxed and informal atmosphere -- they are often referred to by local residents as \"neighborhood bars,\" where people in the neighborhood gather to drink and socialize. Individual bars may be considered to be disreputable, sinister, or even a detriment to the community.\n\nTommy's Pub may not be some people's idea of fun, but if you are a fan of dive bars, Tommy's is a masterpiece.  I had one friend say he liked it because he is always the youngest one there and he is early 40s.  Tuesday is vinyl night, you can bring in your vinyl records and they will play them for you on their state of the art turn table.\n\nWe went in one afternoon, drank a couple of beers and listened to George Jones and Johnny Cash.   It's so fun to walk out of a dimly lit bar and being blinded by the sun. Feeling the sun on your face with a happy little afternoon buzz.  If you go in be sure to buy your membership, it's a private club.
