I've been a member at Venice Fitness for about half a year now and signed on for the rest of the year.  I wanted to try the gym for a while before commenting in order to give all of you a fair assessment.  \nI've been a member of several gyms (Extreme Fitness-Pickering, Premier Fitness-Beaches and Good Life-Morningside) over the past 10+ years and hands down Venice Fitness has to be thee best of all of them--and for a very reasonable price as well.  \nVenice is a very large and spacious gym.  They have more than enough strength training machines, a mix of both old and newer machines.  The machines are very well maintained, which I found to be an issue with the other gyms whereas the leather\/padding would be ripped or worn-out.  If you do encounter any issues, you simply have to bring it up to their attention.  They also have a large abundance of cardio machines; in fact as soon as you enter the main gym area, there is two separate sections of cardio equipment 3 levels high.  There are about 10 more cross training machines on the other end of the gym.  And more in the separate mademoiselle area.  The only down side has to do with the cardio equipment and some of them not working, but in my experience, this is a common occurrence with all gyms mainly because all cardio equipment have a lot of moving parts and see a lot of use, it will fail after a period of time.\nI've never had to wait for any of the equipment.  Even if I did want a particular machine to use, there are more then one of the same type of work out machines.  For example there is about 4 different Preacher Bench style workout machines from different manufactures...the 2 names that come to mind are Hammer Strength and Cybex.\nThe Mademoiselle Only area for ladies does not cost any more money. \nThere is also a boxing ring, wellness centre, smoothie bar, tanning lounge within the same facility--which really gives you an idea how big this place is.
