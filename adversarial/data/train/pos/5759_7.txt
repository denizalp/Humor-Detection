I went to the cafe with a few coworkers for lunch after seeing a my fellow Yelpers reviews on the place. Overall I would say the ambiance leaves much to be desired, but the food is definitely worth the venture.\n\nWhen you walk in you'll see a bunch of hodge podge acrylic paintings on the wall and picnic table settings around the room. I kind of felt like I was walking into an antique store that also served food. \n\nThe owner\/server was very friendly. I was excited to try the food after hearing her French accent. I ended up ordering the Crepes Bastille...and oh my, best crepe I've had in awhile. The texture of the crepe was soft and thin, and the filling was magnificent. Savory caramelized onions and mushrooms contrasted the sweeter cheese and cream flavors. The chicken was tender, and the hints of Tarragon were not overpowering. I'll definitely be back to try dessert! \n\nThe decor needs a face lift and I wish they had a better hot tea selection, but I'll keep coming back for the most important part. Their scrumptious food!
