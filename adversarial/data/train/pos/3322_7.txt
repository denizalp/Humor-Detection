The inside of this bakery reminds me of a Disney movie- and I'm fairly certain Sleeping Beauty would rather be woken up by baked goods falling into her mouth rather than an unwanted kiss from a stinky prince. Who knows where he's been?! \n\nBut Sleeping Beauty must be addicted to sugar if this is her sweet shop of choice. The sugar cookies and white cake I sampled were one-note, super-sweet. Good frosting, but the cookies by and large were not my bag. $4 for a cookie that only seems to have flavor in the chocolate or peanut butter chunks is a waste. The cake pop was also similarly flavorless, in that their featured chocolate flavor was very flat-tasting. Nice presentation, but lacking the quality to justify the prices. \n\nService was sweet, friendly, and eager to make recommendations. I like that they sell gift items rather than just baked goods. I'm intrigued by the push-up cake pops and truffles, but I'll save those for another visit, after my doctor verifies that I haven't contracted hyperglycemia from the samples.
