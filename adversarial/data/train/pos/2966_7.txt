Any time you go to teppan it's going to be expensive but the quality of the service and food should be on par with the dollaz.  \n\nI think Hon Machi is about where it should be in terms of service and food.  Albeit, I haven't tried the sushi, the teppanyaki has always been great.  \n\nI have three kids (*gasps*) and I often dread going anyplace that doesn't scream 'KIDS MEAL' when I'm taking the gang out.  But every once in while you gotta suck it up and do it.  \n\nHon Machi was very accommodating.  My kids were on their best behavior.  They actually do have a kid's menu from which my son ordered yakisoba with the veggies on the side.  No prob.  The dish came quick from the kitchen.\n\nMy daughter had the kids shrimp and it was plenty for her plus the fried rice.  Both my wife and I had the shrimp\/steak combo and we had no complaints.\n\nWhen it comes to teppan, I'm no expert.  I've been a couple times and I like the atmosphere of this place.  I like that the teppan chefs are outgoing and make the experience enjoyable.  Yeah, they joke.  Yeah, they flame that grill out and throw things around but that's what I want if I'm gonna drop some coin.\n\nGo.  Decide for yourself.\n\nI think it's good and actually it wasn't all that expensive.
