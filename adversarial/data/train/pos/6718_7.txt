We would like to leave less than one star, but, guess that's not possible. Never will we step foot in that store again even though it's less than 2 miles from home. The guy (owner, I presume-since otherwise he would be fired by now) is RUDE. And that's putting it nicely. He never even acknowledged us the whole time we were in his shop and made our purchases. Don't buy from him.
