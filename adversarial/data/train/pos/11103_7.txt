Yummy is all I can say.   My husband had never really experienced great tamales.   He had the usual dried out bland tamale, not at The TAMALE STORE.   It was the Saturday before Christmas and they were basically sold out.   We bought the 3 options they had, Red (hot) pork, Green Pork and the green corn.   WOW, the green corn are now going to be a favorite.   We used our rice cooker to steam them and made rice at the same time.   AMAZING.   \n\nWe can't wait to go back and get more flavors.    Thank you so much!!!
