I normally love bar & grills, you can always find great food at decent prices, and really friendly staff.\n\nMy husband and I were up late and decided to try this place out since it's conveniently down the street from us. We walked in, we were not greeted or acknowledged. We didn't know if we had to sit at the bar or if we could sit in the separate dining area they have. \n\nWe waited to ask and we were ignored. Never stepping foot into this place again. I'd rather take the drive across town to my normal joints. What a disappointment.
