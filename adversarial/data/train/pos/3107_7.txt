There is something to be said about properly prepared Italian food.  Having been to Italy recently, I now taste the difference between American Italian, and the real stuff you'd find in Tuscany. I'm just a big fan of entrees prepared table side.  I had the Steak Dianne, and it was the perfect balance of medium rare steak and a very flavorful mushroom cream sauce.  Me and my co worker split that portion and also had an order of the calamari!   Really really fresh.  Finally, we ordered the Tiramisu with a glass of port.  It reminded me of Sinatra's at the Encore!  Served in a martini glass and just perfect.  I really don't see how these other people had so bad of a time.  I came on a Wednesday night, and the service and atmosphere was great.  Scottsdale keeps surprising me with the number of great dining spots here.  I may just turn in my aloha shirts and make my way to the desert!
