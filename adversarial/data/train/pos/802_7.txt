Sorry, but I'm pretty disappointed with this place\n. I  expect competent staff for the exorbitant prices charged for the food and alcohol. What good is an extensive selection of highly-appraised food and alcohol on an iPad when the staff has little interest or focus to manage it. Sitting at the bar or at a table, the service sucked. I  get it that people make mistakes, but come on if I  wanted a third rate experience I  sure as hell wouldn't come to the Las Vegas Strip, and of the most expensive hotels on the Las Vegas Strip to find it. This is a pathetic example of everything that is wrong with the Las Vegas union economy today. Shameful.\n\nComment from Ryan L. regarding this review: \"You're an idiot, straighten up.\" and \"Stop with the immature reviews.\" Congratulations, Ryan L., welcome to your fifteen minutes of fame.  As for me, I call it like I see it. Your approval is not needed.
