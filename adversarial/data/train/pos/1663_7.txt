We came here just because we were waiting on a table at Crepe Cellar and then we ended up getting full on bar snacks! We tried the fries, the wings, the pretzel, the fried chicken taco, a portobello sandwich and the chicken skins. I would recommend getting two tacos and a beer to anyone coming here for a quick bite to eat. The fried chicken taco was the best thing I tried. The wings were ok, I like wings fried hard and these weren't. The fries were good but not a must. The chicken skins I would skip - kind of gimmicky and $7. Our friend had the sandwich and the pretzel and he didn't say anything bad about them and finished both. I didn't expect to like this place because it was dark and packed. They've got booths but you kind of seat yourself? The waitresses were all \"in a mood\" like they were mad they had to be there. Not really a welcoming vibe.\n\nAs for drinks, funny to see a shandy on the menu out of season but I would recommend the Shandy the Elder. Really refreshing and light - I'd drink another anytime!
