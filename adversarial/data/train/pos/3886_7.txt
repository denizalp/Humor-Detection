we just stayed at the encore and were at there pool. We found there service to be insincere. They generally will have good face to face interaction but rarely follow through with anything. Drinks and food are outrageously expensive and the \"European pool\" is always in and out of the shade. Also, We got a cabana which never saw the sun. Finally, we left some sun glasses in the women's bathroom. The staff said they had found them  but instead of turning them into the lost and found left them on their cleaning cart and another staff member must of took them because we never got them back. After 6 phone calls thier claims staff said too bad.\n\nWe will not be staying at the Encore ever...
