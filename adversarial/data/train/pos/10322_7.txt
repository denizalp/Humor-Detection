Pretentious to the extreme, HIGHLY overrated, and hilariously overpriced. The cheese board--for 12 bucks we got maybe 3 ounces of cheese, some nuts, tough slices of rye bread, and some crappy pureed apple \"jam\"--was the tiniest I have ever been served.The almost 10 dollar tequila drink (the Paloma) tasted like a typical greyhound (pepper in water? Whatever.) \n\nThe staff were rude as shit. Completely unhelpful, and unfriendly as well. Dilettantes project indeed. Wow, you have a centrifuge! How nice for you. Watching all of the staff standing around yakking away just made us roll our eyes. Madisonians are suckers for this kind of wanna-be urban hipster crap and it is just embarrassing. Lah de fucking dah, suckers.\n\nAfterwards, we went across the street to The Caribou, were greeted by a friendly bartender and served promptly.
