Not very impressed with there chicken fingers at all maybe I need to try there chicken instead \nMashed potatoes where okay, nothing special \nThere bread was amazing \nFriendly staff \nI'm really not sure I would go back to this place. \nIf you must try it, go on Tuesday when they have the Tuesday special.. they do have happy hour 2 to 5 and there sweet tea is pretty good, watch out raising Caine's.
