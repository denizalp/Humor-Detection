So, this is probably the worst Nordstrom I have ever been too. And I have been to almost all on the west coast. It is not because of lack of product or prices. Nordstrom is about top products but, first it is about customer service. I have lived in Vegas for a year and have visited this store at least 20 times hoping for a \"Nordstrom Experience\". Only once from Jeanette in Men's sportswear and my monthly shoe shines are the times I get good service. I am just at the very least looking at getting greated once I am seen in a department instead of having to wait for salespeople to quit conversing with each other. I am from the Seattle area and I have personal shoppers still to this day help me with products. I would rather gather sku's in Vegas and have them send me product from Seattle than to shop at this store. Because I know the salespeople there will still send me a thank card, tell me about events and say hi if I am in there department. At least earn your comission somewhat; I know people in shoes earn 8-10% commission and clothes earn 5-8% comission so please do something about the service here or reread your handbooks or even the book \"Leave it Better than you Found it\" by Bruce Nordstrom. Oh thats right this is an internal book that must be being used as a doorstop there. \n\n@nordstrom
