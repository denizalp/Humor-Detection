One star goes to the female manager who felt the need to power trip and walk up to me to turn off my cellphone that was not bothering any of the other patrons. First of all, I'm pregnant and emailing my doctor. Second, if my cellphone use is not bothering anyone around me, meaning it was on silent with the light on dim, why should it matter? To avoid any further disturbance to the other patrons, I decided to turn my phone off. While she kept making sure my phone was off. \n\nI wanted to speak to her after the movie(watched the 6:05pm showing of Zootopia) but I did not see her. I would totally understand that I should turn off my phone if it was bothersome but honestly, with less than 10 people in the theater and no one around us, I don't think it was necessary.
