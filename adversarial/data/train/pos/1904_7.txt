Will greeted me at the door with s daisy and a smile.  I was lead to my table that was covered in rose petals. \n\nA fountain of champagne was wheeled over to\nMy table as I was enjoying table side preparation of baked Alaska.  \n\nTo say I'm impressed would be an understatement.  The oiled shirtless bartenders reminded me of studio 54.  \n\nWhat a great addition to such an amazing area.
