Best pho restaurant in the valley... hands down! I almost called my parents in the middle of eating lunch to tell them they have been making pho wrong for the last 29 years I have been alive and they need to come out here and try it... they are from Vietnam, live in Southern California and make pho every weekend to basically feed the masses. I thought I died and went to heaven when I ate this pho (pho tai). I have never in my entire life finished a bowl of pho before because I was always \"too full to finish\". One of the seven deadly sins got me this day... as I committed the sin of gluttony and CRUSHED it! I went back the following week to get one to go and slurped away at my desk. Also, I would like to mention, this place reminds me of garden grove pho restaurants- super busy but friendly and the prices are DIRT cheap, how pho used to be. \n\nI dream about this restaurant....
