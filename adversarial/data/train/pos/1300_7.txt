A hip, contemporary sushi spot was what downtown Vegas was missing, and Bocho filled that void. With competitive prices and scrumptious menu items, it gives other restaurants in the area a run for their money. \n\nRegular lunch and dinner menus are offered, but if you want the AYCE experience, you can have that too. Both my friend and I ordered the AYCE dinner, which is 30 bucks per person. The menu is unlike the exhaustive list of specialty rolls, entrees, and appetizers found at other sushi restaurants; although, it doesn't include items offered on their regular menu. \n\nSitting on the second floor loft beats eating at the crowded sushi bar. I do like how the two are separated. The bar was much busier and louder as opposed to the laid-back atmosphere above. Plus, the seats are cushioned and there are pillows!\n\nHere's what I ordered, and I'd most likely select these again.\n\n* Calamari Skewers (yeaah, squid on a stick!)\n* Baked Salmon Roll\nÂ­* Crunch Dragon Roll\n* Las Vegas Roll\n* Unagi\n* Masago (no quail egg available)\n* Garlic tuna \n* Fatty tuna \n* Octopus \n\nMy favorite roll was the baked salmon with cream cheese, avocado, crab, and baked salmon on the outside. The sashimi was also delicious. I wouldn't mind returning to eat just sashimi and calamari skewers. \n\nOur food arrived promptly, and the service was great. I'll definitely be returning.
