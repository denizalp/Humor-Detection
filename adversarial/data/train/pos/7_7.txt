I've been here a couple of times.  Something I discovered this time that might help out a previous poster is that there is a second front entrance to the store, about ten feet to the right of the main entrance that gets you into the store without having to go through the gaming area.\n\nIf you're using a Garmin product to get here, my up to date Garmin keeps trying to get me to turn into 8 Strathearn which is a good distance down the avenue from 20.\n\nUpon entering the store and spying the mass of gamers actively gaming, my five year old daughter blurts out \"Daddy look at all those nerds\".  She had a great time in the store, and found a lot of my little pony stuff, and video game culture items.  \n\nI saw all kinds of stuff that I like, and some things I wasn't aware of that were even on the market.  I only play d&d and paint (but dont play) Warhammer fantasy.  They still had some old fantasy models in stock which was great for me.  I'd like to see more paint than just Citadel \/ GW paint, as it looks like I'm going to have to resort to amazon for reaper MSP.  I don't know if the merchant agreement with GW allows them to sell a different paint line.\n\nIts a comic store that over time has branched into gaming, with a good selection of board games, and a lot of d&d, even more pathfinder.  The funko pop figures were nice and high off of the ground where my five year old couldn't grab them.\n\nI like the store, I just hate buying stuff at the store when my wife comes with because then she will bother me about buying RPG stuff.  My wife's complaint was about the smell of BO coming from the gaming section.  My response was that is really beyond the ability of ownership to control.  Plus our son would likely be one of the BO-ers
