Scam artists with their misleading Groupons.  I made the mistake of buying a Groupon for 3 manicures and was going to take two friends while I'm in town for a visit.  Their 'fine print' didn't say they could only be used by one person, nor did it specify that it couldn't be used for a group.  \n\nNeedless to say, I called to schedule and was told that I'd have to use the 3 services on 3 consecutive visits...which wasn't explained in the Groupon ad.  \n\nSo these stupid groupons are useless to me cuz I'm not going back by myself 3 times.\n\nAny company that has to scam their customers like this shouldn't be in business.
