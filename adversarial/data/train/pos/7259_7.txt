One of the managers of SumoMaya wrote me a Yelp message and instead of apologizing for the poor dining experience he blamed me for going out to eat on a Saturday night. Clearly his staff wasn't able to handle a busy dining room and he suggested that I come in during the week when the restaurant is dead and there's only a handful of tables. Sorry buddy I won't be returning ever.
