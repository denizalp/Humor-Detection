Came here with a friend to check out this new boba spot. I ordered the T.G.I.F. with boba.\n\nT.G.I.F (3 stars)- this drink had pieces of strawberry  and was flavored with lychee and peach. Price was reasonable but they only had one size (12oz) drinks. I thought the bottles they had were pretty cool but the drink was actually fairly small in comparison to a lot of other boba spots. This drink had good flavors but 1) size of drink was not customizable 2) you could not alter the sugar level since it was pre-made 3) boba was a little too mushy and soft for my liking.
