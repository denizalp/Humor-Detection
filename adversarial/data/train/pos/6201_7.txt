There are much better places to spend your money in Vegas!  Went to the restaurant based on reviews from EATER, it was a mistake. Very tiny portions by any standard,  the food was ok and nothing that great.  The waiter was quite rude and acted like he was doing us a favor to wait on us!\nSome of the entertainment was great, the tap dancer, however the singer was a major disappointment. We were celebrating a big event and asked her to acknowledge the honoree, she continued to ignore our party of 10, much to our disappointment, so we left!
