This place does have good prices, but YOU have to pay shipping. That's fine, but when you need to return or exchange something, you have to pay to send the item back, then pay shipping again to have the exchanged item sent to you. Not good. I called and left a message. Didn't receive a call back. So I called again to ask how exchanges worked, the girl on the phone was very unprofessional, dry, uncaring, and didn't seem to want to talk to me. I got my one word answer \"No\", then just silence. I'm starting to buy more equipment and supplies.. But I think I'll try Pet Edge, or better yet - Amazon. Amazon takes exchanges, they pay for shipping, and they care about customer service.. and at least trying to keep their customers. What a shame Ryan's. I'm also an instructor at a grooming school, and won't refer my students to you anymore.
