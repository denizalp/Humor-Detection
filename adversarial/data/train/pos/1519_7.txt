Location: On Queen Street West, away from the hustle and bustle, but in an area where hipsters wander the streets. Street parking is available but check the zoning. \n\nThe place: Tiny - this is a take-out place. \n\nThe goods: OK, well I found out about this place because I was reading reviews about a coffee shop that's next door, where reviewers kept talking about ice cream. When I went to said coffee place, I walked in expecting to see ice cream somewhere but nope. Then I heard the people ahead of me talking to the clerk about ice cream (again!) and a line-up. When I left, I then realized they were talking about this place. As you may have heard, there's a massive line-up because everyone wants to eat black ice cream. I made my friends line up with me because I was curious and standing in line all day waiting to get onto the GA floor at the U2 show the day before, wasn't enough standing around. Anyway. it took 45 minutes to get in the place. I had the ube nut + the matcha bean (that's black & purple + white & green to you novices). I thought it was pretty good ice cream. I really did. But not 45-minutes worth of queuing, good. I'd be just as happy going to a corner store and getting a Hagen Das bar. I'm sure the hype will eventually die down - they are relatively new. \n\nService: Good. The staff is very friendly!\n\nPrice point: $6.50 for a cone. Its pretty big so I guess it's worth it.... Take note though - the ice cream melts pretty fast and it's not uncommon to see melted ice cream on the pavement outside the shop.... wanna know why? Because it falls off the cone when you make sudden movements! In fact, my friend got his cone from the clerk and turned around to have his girlfriend taste it, and the whole thing landed on her feet (and her phone). It was pretty damn funny, I must admit.
