-BUG EVERYWHERE, DON'T LOOK UP AT THE LIGHTS YOU WILL GAG\n-SERVICE TAKES FOREVER, DON'T GO HUNGRY\n-BATHROOMS NEED A KEY, ATTACHED TO A DIRTY WOODEN SPOON\n-PRICES ARE RIDICULOUS FOR SUCH TERRIBLE QUALITY\n-HORRIBLE FOOD, WEAK FLAVOURS\n-WHEN THEY CLEAR A TABLE, THEY DO NOT WIPE IT DOWN. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED. THEY SIMPLY RESET THE FLATWARE AND NAPKINS. \nNEVER GOING AGAIN.\n\nThese reviews have got to be jokes, because there is no way anyone could consider this food to be good by any standard. To begin with, we walked in to the mostly empty restaurant and had to flag down the hostess to be seated. We wanted to be seated near the window, no luck, as that would have meant that she would have had to clean the table off first. So she declined and sat us elsewhere. We then waited for 20 minutes to get a menu. Again, we had to flag down a server in a mostly empty restaurant. She immediately got us a menu, by taking two away from the couple seated near us....WTF. They hadn't even ordered yet. So the four of us had two menus. Oh well, that's ok. We waited another 25 minutes for her to come back and ordered. We got the #10 Glass Noodle Salad, #1 Chickpea Fritters, #17 Chicken Noodle Dish, #27 Beef Curry. The Salad was not glass noodle. It was a strange type noodle similar to spaghetti, the flavours of the salad were mild and almost non existent. Curry, chicken, hardboiled egg, coconut milk, and cucumber with peanuts. But every single component was so watered down it was a joke and the chicken was coated with a mystery ingredient. :P My favourite part was the salad was luke warm so i had no idea if it was supposed to be hot or cold. The beef curry was also a letdown. Very very mild with cheap cuts of beef you could have bounced off the floor. Even the appy was a let down, cheap fritters with a small serving of sauce, COVERED in chill flakes, enough that we gave up on the sauce. I love spice, I'll cover anything in Siracha, but come on it was a joke. My least favourite was the chicken noodle. It had tomato sauce from a can and half cooked noodles. It was served with a side of broth meant to be poured over it, but it was just dried garlic and pepper in a weak stock.\nSuch a friggin ripoff
