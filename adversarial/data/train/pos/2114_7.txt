I decided to stop in here because I was looking for a wireless mouse and keyboard. I thought they would have a decent selection. I found a Logitech set up for $79 and purchased it. Then I drove over to Best Buy to buy an Anchorman 2 DVD, and checked the keyboard\/mouse set up. This same one was on sale for $59. I returned to Office Depot with a price tag photo from BB and asked if they would honor the lower price. No issues, no problems, done in 3 minutes. Helpful staff, friendly.
