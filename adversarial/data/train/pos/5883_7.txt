HO0O0O0O0O0 BRAH, DO I EVER LOVE THIS PLACE. Theses cupcakes stay freakin onolicious! Alright so i have only tried a few of their cup cake flavors, such as the Prince, a chocolate kine, and a vanilla one and butterscotch. All were so moist and decadent. Consuming all these different cupcake flavors reminds me of eating fluffy clouds of various colors. That is to say, these cupcakes would be perfect for a cloudy day, because you could just eat all the gloom away by devouring a sunny butterscotch banana cupcake. What i mean to say is: THESE CUPCAKES ARE PURE CULINARY ESCAPISM! And sometimes you just need to chill on a cloud, cuz! Shoots, these cupcakes really cheer  you up lidat! \n\nThe service is nice. I enjoy the fact that one of the employees remembers who i am and sometimes remembers what i got last. That's nice! \n\nAnyways, TRY EAT ASAP!
