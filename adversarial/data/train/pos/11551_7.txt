McCarran Airport may be one of the greatest United States airports.  Like most airports, there could be more outlets at the gates, and the passenger drop-off outside the airport becomes standstill very quickly.  It's busy with lots of flights, but there is just so much to do here.  It's also in the center of Vegas.  What more could you want?\n\nSecurity:  This security is pretty fast but a little rude.  This TSA has different rules than every other airport so they just sit an scream the rules out.  A national standard would be more helpful.\n\nSignage: Not great from outside the airport but once you are in it  is OK.\n\nWifi: I didn't try it.\n\nSeating:  Your standard old-school seating is all over, but there is an acceptable amount.\n\nCharacter:  LOVE this airport for this reason.  It's showy and flashy, just like a Vegas airport should be.  I enjoyed playing the Wheel of Fortune slot machines while waiting for my flight.  There is also a really cute pet relief area in the Southwest terminal.\n\nFood\/Shopping:  Considering the size of this airport, I would have liked more options for breakfast.  The fast food prices were really high, even for an airport.  There were no healthy breakfast options in my terminal.\n\nOutlets:  There were a few charging stations and some outlets under seats, but there could have been more outlets.
