When I was a kid, maybe 6 or 7, my mother took me to a neighbor's home to pick out a kitten as my new pet. One of the kitties was born terribly deformed. Her back was abnormally arched, and bulged out. She couldn't walk, and my mom told me that poor kitty probably wouldn't survive for very long. I knew instantly this was the kitty I had to take home. If it was the last thing I did, it was going to be making sure she had best possible life I could provide for her until that sad, inevitable day arrived. \n\nI named her Jennifer. She and I were inseparable! I would run home from school everyday, ecstatic, and eager to see my beloved pet.  As she got a little older, she started to walk a little bit. I would lay down on the floor to watch tv, and she would climb up onto my chest, and sleep there. Everything I did involved little Jennifer. She was my best friend. \n\nAs she grew, the strain on her back became more and more stressed. Suddenly, she couldn't walk anymore. No more climbing up to cuddle with me. Finally after a couple of weeks, I got home from school, and ran to her little bed... but no Jennifer. My parents called me into the kitchen to explain that Jennifer had died while I was at school. They told me she was in a lot of pain, but that the pain was over, and that she was now in kitty heaven.\n\nI was devastated. I couldn't sleep. I couldn't eat. I couldn't watch tv because it reminded me of little Jennifer. My sunshine kitty. All I could do was cry. I cried every night for a week straight. Eventually, I came to terms with her death, but needless to say, it was a very sad time in my life. I did learn a good life lesson though.\n\nThe Tikka Masala I ordered from Spice It Up was almost as sad. Save your money. Save your time. If you must eat from this food truck, I would recommend you adopt a deformed, dying kitty cat first.. because when it passes on to kitty heaven, you might then be able to forget about spending $11 dollars on complete rubbish.
