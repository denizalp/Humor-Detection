If there is one thing that Aussies (especially those from Sydney and Melbourne) are snobby and in the know about... it's coffee. At least this is what I was told by Yelp pals from the land down under over the years. \n\nSo imagine my piqued interest when I came across The Sydney Grind, and Australian inspired coffee shop and bakery in a local community paper for the Lakeshore communities of Mimico and Longbranch. \n\nLocated just east of Islington and Lakeshore, The Sydney Grind stands out like a beacon of white light in an area that... is still \"on the comeback\". It's clean. It's white. It's bright and the inside modern and minimalist. \n\nThere is an abundance of seating here, far more than you would expect from a local\nCoffee shop, with paired seating at the front running along a long built in bench, a communal table in the middle and then a rear private area with an additional 8-10 seats. The best part about this rear area is that it overlooks an open window into the kitchen where all the baked goods are made in house daily. \n\nWith regards to the baked goods, they have a crazy assortment, from common items like banana bread and cookies, to Australian favs like fairy cake, and even biscotti - which, while not Australian necessarily, are an homage to the business that used to inhabit this location.  \n\nLastly, the coffee, wow. They use propeller beans here and I had two caffeinated beverages while I was here, an Americano and a iced coffee (iced Americano). This stuff was STRONG, I had the caffeine junky jitters all day. Wow. But the taste was smooth and crisp with no residual after taste. Amazing. \n\nI'm so happy that a new cafe opened near my hood especially one as unique and well executed as The Sydney Grind. Expect to see me here on the regular.
