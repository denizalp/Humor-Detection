Pretty awesome business.  Actually, pretty awesome project I should say.  They're one of the lucky businesses that have been included in the Pittsburgh Pop-Up Project - a program that helps business development downtown (http:\/\/projectpopuppittsburgh.wordpress.com\/about\/).  \n\nThe whole concept is that the workers are \"dreamers.\"  Whatever flavor you choose is assigned to a certain dream.  So every purchase of ice cream allows 25% of the profits to go to that certain dream.  Some of the dreams are making an album, raising money for the Liver Foundation, a missions trip, tea room and the list goes on.  Such a cool concept, right?  \n\nSo let's get to sweet stuff, the ice cream!  It's Perry's Ice Cream, which I haven't had too much of... but will now!  I tried the Carrot Cake, which was incredible!!  It seriously tasted exactly like carrot cake, with cream cheese included!  YUMM-O!  They actually had a bunch of winning flavors for me... Cookie Dough, Birthday Cake, etc.  \n\nSo here's the thing... visit this ice cream shop because it's not only local, but you'll be supporting someone's dreams.  Ice cream + dreams = makes ya feel great!
