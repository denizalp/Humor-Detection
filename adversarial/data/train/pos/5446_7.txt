Not bad!  The fam and I went out for dinner tonight, and the Husband was happy to discover that Pizza Heaven not only has gluten-free pizza, but wings and pasta too!  A gluten-free trifecta!\n\nIt is great to have so many options, and the pizza and honey-hot wings were fairly tasty... but it wasn't anything extraordinary.  Just a basic casual pizza spot, where you won't be terribly embarrassed if your 4-year-old throws a temper tantrum.  Umm.. not that that happened to us, or anything... \n\nThe highest point was the service.  Our server was incredibly attentive and took great care of us.  Thanks!
