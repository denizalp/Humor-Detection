My beau dragged me here, and I am so grateful that he did -- The Twinkie Boy Milkshake is amazing! Why haven't I seen this before? Vanilla Ice Cream, Twinkie, and Caramel Syrup? Done and DONE! Imagine that, and they puncture that twinkie with the straw that you're drinking... That's a glass of deliciousness!\n\nThe Lamb Tandoori Burger is Ace. Can't go wrong with Colorado Lamb*, Mint-Cilantro Yogurt Sauce, Cucumber, Olives, Red Onion, Tomato. My beau craves this everytime we come to Vegas, and I wouldn't call it \"being dragged to\" anymore. I'm looking forward to my next visit. \n\nAlright so it's a rockin' spot set up at the Mirage. Ambiance and food. Yes please!
