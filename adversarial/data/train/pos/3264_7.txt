Update - My dog must have had a bad infection from the surgery - the vet I took her to gave her antibiotics and she got 2 huge abscesses on her abdomen which I had to rupture and drain, which took days to empty and are still healing. Then I had to take her back into the vet when the pain from the abscess was causing her to limp because the pain was spreading to her leg. Crazy to think that the reason that I came here in the first place was to avoid the 300 dollar price tag that my vet quoted me for the spay. Now I've just ended up having to go to the local vet several times for follow up with the infection she acquired here, spending an upwards of 500 dollars. Bottom line - I highly recommend you get your pet spayed or neutered somewhere else, even though it costs more.
