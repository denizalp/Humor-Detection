I don't like desserts, I love desserts.  Needless to say the talk of new pastry shops tends to pique my curiosity. So when I heard of Libertine Bakehouse in Saint Henri I put it on my list of places to try.  It is located right on Atwater St and parking is free.  It is also close to Lionel Groulx metro if you are coming by transit.\n\nThe space itself is quite small and bare.  There isn't much seating.  Another thing that turned me off was that the tables all have these really low-hanging lamps hanging over them which are easy to bump into if you're tall like me.  It doesn't hurt or anything but it is a bit of a nuisance.\n\nNow on to the food and drink.  The selection is small but as long as the quality is there this doesn't bother me.  Unfortunately the quality was lacking.  I got a brioche feuillet√© au chocolat to snack on.  While the chocolate ganache filling had a rich chocolatey flavour to it the pastry, which was croissant-style, was stale which ruined the whole thing.  Also in need of something to drink I got a glass of their pineapple iced tea which basically tasted like pineapple juice that I could find in any grocery store.  There was nothing remarkable about it.\n\nHaving paid over $7 for this afternoon snack I feel like it is overpriced.  If the freshness had been there I would have said otherwise but that isn't the case.  With other great pastry shops in the area they need to think about upping their game.
