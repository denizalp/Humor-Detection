The name change is a little ridiculous, and I have no idea what is going on with that.  Overall, it's pretty good, but I have to admit, I really like the IDEA of C&F rather than its execution.  I miss the more frequent cupcake options, and although the gelato is good and the coffee beverages still alright, it's far less awesome than I initially felt when I moved here 3 years ago.
