The ice cream dude wanted me to have the caramel cashew...........\n\nMy mom and I stopped in.  When I step up to order the guy says \"caramel cashew?\" And I'm like no.... and I order my coffee ice cream scoops and my moms chocolate fudge 5 scooper.\n\nWhat do I get, the caramel cashew... men have such poor listening skills!  Why do I look so caramel cashew-y???\n\nIt wasn't bad, don't get me wrong! I didn't complain so my bad.  I was mostly creeped out when he called me by name after looking at my credit card so I didn't want to point out his mistake.  When my mom mentioned we used to go to the old location he said \"I think I remember you...\" so fake because we haven't been there in 15 years.\n\nI really hate to complain about an ice cream store, like damn I also hate puppies and rainbows.
