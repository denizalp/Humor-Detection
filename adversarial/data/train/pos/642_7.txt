very close to a 5...  so a 4.5 but yelp fails at halves\n\nOnly reason prevented me from a 5 is that it's more of a family place and traditional setting that I'd like to hang out with friends at... lots of kids... sorry I can't do the screaming thing.\n\nFood wise... chips and salsa are SOO frickin good.  I used to stop by on my way home once a week and buy a big bag of chips and a big thing of their salsa... \n\nCookin is always good and comes out pipin hot exactly as ordered and I always order custom style and they have no problem making it the way I want it.\n\nI've been going here for years and will continue to do so.  Also this one is better than the one on University.
