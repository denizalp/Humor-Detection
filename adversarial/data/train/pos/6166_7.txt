I remember coming here on a Tuesday\/Wednesday night with my dad. We were downtown and I said I wanted to try this new pho place. Y'see my dad is more open to trying new restaurants whereas my mom is 'if I like this place, it's the best until they serve a cockroach on my plate' Y'know THAT kind of parent. \n\nSo, since we were both downtown. We headed to Ossington. I read about this place on Yelp and decided to try it out. \n\nK first off, I was really impressed that this place was a full house on a weekday night. We waited about 5 minutes or less and I ordered a rare beef and beef ball pho and my dad ordered the same. I also wanted to try the cold rolls so I got one of those too. \n\nThe food took longer than we expected, because we usually go to Pho Hung and the service there is always consistently fast. The rolls came first and they were good, but I was dissapointed since the rice paper was ripped! Well, I don't realy see how it could be AMAZING unless they seriously jazz it up a lot. It was a regular cold roll. Yummy, but not over-the-top-orgasmic. Soon shortly, our pho arrived. \n\nDamn. 'That's a lot of green' I thought to myself. 'cause it was COVERED in green onion. Anyway, I tasted the soup base and suprisingly it wasn't as overwhelming as I initially thought it'd be (from the green onion). It was pretty darn good. The soup base was very hm...how do I say this in English... like a light soup base with natural flavours. It didn't taste really concentrated, but the flavours of the green onion really gave it a settle yet flavourful soup. However, as you keep eating, those green onions start to get a bit more pungent.  I think the portion was a bit smaller than Hung's. Nonetheless this was -THE- perfect place to go because it was COLD AS HELL on the day we went. After our pho meal, we hopped over to Venezia's and grabbed ourselves 2 natas (portugese eggtarts). Delicious night!\n\nOverall: Little less green, please!
