This place has an obvious identity crisis. \n\nThey ARE an authentic Szechuan Chinese restaurant BUT have to serve Americanized Chinese food on the side. They make it awkwardly obvious they are not proud of that separating the menu between \"Authentic\" and \"Americanized\". It's like the 1970s and 80s all over again! I guess Phoenix doesn't have enough customers to appreciate Szechuan cuisine at it's finest. \n\nFood: \nMe: Mapo tofu \nLady: American or Chinese style? \nMe: .....?? *In my head* I'm freakin Chinese give me the Chinese one! \n\nMapo Tofu - I should have order the American one...what she was really asking is Cantonese or Szechuan. Cantonese is sweeter with a semi thick sauce. Szechuan version is soaked in hot oil which did not set well for my stomach and it is the knumbing version which makes you feel like crap if you're not use to it. \n\nSizzling rice soup - MSG soup with snow peas, baby corn, chicken and shrimp. Ok ok I should expect a dish like this to such, but my American side was craving this...don't judge me! \n\nService: \nLimited English staff. Chinese attitude. I Love it! But not after a long day at work. \n\nEnvironment: \nIt actually looks pretty nice in here. About 60% of their patrons are actually Chinese with limited English. \n\nPrice: \nWasn't expensive for the type of food served. Americanized menu is much cheaper. \n\nI would give this place another shot if I lived in the area.\n\nFood: 2\nService: 2\nEnvironment: 4\nPrice: 3
