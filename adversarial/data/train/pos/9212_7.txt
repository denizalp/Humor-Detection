This was the biggest disappointment since moving to Scottsdale. The reviews on Yelp made this place seem amazing. I took the advice and ordered the pork tacos and table side guacamole. The table side guac wasnt even made table side. The tacos came out as a chunk of pork roast, not shredded, it be slow cooked for hours, it was tough. I have made more tender pork at home in the crock pot. The tortillas were served on a salt brick, which was beautiful. However the taste, made me crave the prepackaged tortillas from Fry's. Dinner for four came to over $100, and we were all less than impressed. My advice, go around the corner to Rehab burger!
