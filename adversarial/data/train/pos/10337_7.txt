My family came here for dinner on a Thursday night.  Was a little surprised when we arrived about 6:30pm, not many people were in the place. It's a small place, so I thought that it would fill up quickly. \nAll I have to say is PBR battered  FISH TACOS!  They are AMAZING, it's one of their specials for Thursday night - you won't be disappointed. We also ordered several appetizers Goat Cheese Curds aka best thing you could ever fry, the alligator bites (meh),and  blue cheese and bacon fries (yummy!). My brother in law ordered the Tipsy burger, said that it was good but felt that the burgers from the Old Fashioned or Dotty's are better. Will definitely dine here again.
