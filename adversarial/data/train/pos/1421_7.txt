$5.99 late night steak and eggs. If you can't afford that you must have gambled too hard or fell in love with a stripper.\n\nWe went around midnight and there was no wait to get seated. In fact there was almost nobody else there. It was a Sunday night though. The food came out at a reasonable time. I ordered medium rare for my steak and it came out exactly how I wanted it. And with a big bottle of A1 sauce by my side I could not have asked for a better dinner.
