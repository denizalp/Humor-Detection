Strange layout to this Panera in Boca park - almost seems backward if you enter from one side and featuring a long layout instead of the typical open design of most Panera locations in Las Vegas and back in Ohio I just cannot see the point of visiting this location very often when Sambalatte is just down the way.  Free Wi-Fi is fine and freely refilled coffee is okay too, but there isn't really anything here I'm going to eat so in that case I'd sooner stay home and use my own internet while drinking better coffee.
