Nice looking place and hostess friendly. Starting off ok. \n\nOne cider on large beer menu; they are out. \nChose a pale ale on menu; they are out. \nDecided on water ... you can't be out of that. \n\nOrdered the 'Steak & Guinness pie'; guess what ... they are out. \nNext choice was the 'Rabbit pie'; they are out. \n\nI left.
