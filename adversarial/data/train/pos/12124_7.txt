Spa suite = me in heaven. \n\nAsk me how I ended up here, I will never tell you...unless you buy me a drink, wait...make that three drinks (I kid), then I might consider letting you in on the most epic evening I've experienced thus far in my young years. So yea...\n\nAs a child of a world traveler, I've stayed in a good deal of the upper crust Starwood establishments before and this W is def up to par. Seriously, the whole place was so very awesome! All the staff and even the people staying there too were so nice. Our suite led out to a common patio area and then a gate to continue the party in their swanky patio lounge with awesome VIP\/Bottle Service. I didn't realize the douchiness that all the other yelpers have referenced in their reviews of this sector of the W experience. But then again, I was out at the VIP section of the Bird's Nest prior and probably just became entirely numb to it... *fist pump* I picked up some bad behavior...\n\nI would have totally given this location 5 stars if they hadn't \"lost\" (Someone stole it obviously, so if you have to leave a bag here while waiting for a available room with extremely valuable items in it, I'd advise just lugging it about!) our gracious host's luggage and the Whatever\/Whenever people sending us regular white bread instead of awesome sourdough bread for our olive oil and balsamic vinegar feast. Whats the purpose of that service when they aren't even going to do it right?! Next time I'm getting totally outlandish with my request, just you wait W!!
