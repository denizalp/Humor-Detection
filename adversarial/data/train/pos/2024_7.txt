For $6.50 you get an overstuffed soft shell taco with some fries. The ingredients are of great quality, the service is quick, and there are like 6 menu options total.\n\nThat being said, the fries should come on the side, the staff need to be more outgoing and ready to take customer orders, and the way they have their sauces displayed is (sadly) very unhygienic.\n\nWould definitely stop by on a weekly basis for lunch if I worked nearby.
