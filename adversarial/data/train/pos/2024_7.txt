Best pastrami I have ever had. Very surprised at how good it was and didn't know about this place till this afternoon. Very much worth the long drive out but it was a damn good sandwich. Desserts were really good as well. Highly recommend trying out. Our waitress Romeo was very friendly and made it a great dining experience.
