Strip facing rooms will hear the unshielded music from Carnival Court. Which is great, don't get me wrong, but doesn't end until 3:30 am. So any plans to sleep before then are futile.\n\nDuct tape on the carpet; ladies don't wear the F-me pumps drunk. You will trip.\n\nI was there beginning of April, main elevator bank out of order. Huge lines to use the two smaller elevator banks.\n\nO'Shea's is back and all pretty now. Not the same at all. Still my favorite haunt.\n\nBook at your own risk, and ask for a NON-STRIP facing Room.
