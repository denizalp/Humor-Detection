I was nervous to come here because of the bad reviews on service. \n\nThere were 9 of us that went last night. We wanted a nice dinner before going to see the Jersey Boys and Mon Ami Gabi was a little too expensive for everyone's taste. \n\nWe made a reservation and they sat us immediately. The drinks came fast and the waiter was very attentive. \n\nEverything we had was very good. Steaks, chicken, beef tenderloin, salads, etc. Everyone enjoyed the food very much. \n\n\nI didn't have a lot to say. I just wanted to give them a good review because we didn't have any of the experience others have had. \n\nProps to our waiter - he was excellent with an awesome sense of humor.
