This place is gross.  I left the minute I saw the menu.  Most of the sandwich names include some sort of derogatory quip about women.  The staff look like extras from a Van Wilder movie.  If you want a sandwich with chicken fingers, tater tots, and french fries all rolled into one and slathered in ranch then this is your place.  The place screams frat boy in the worst possible way.  Please don't give this place your patronage.
