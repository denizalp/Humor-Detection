This place is more inconsistant than your bipolar ex-girlfriend  at the end of  3 day bender.\n There are some tasty things on the menu. the issue is there are other things that are just plain bad. I am not sure why things like hofun are on the menu when they clearly have no clue as how prepare them. The girl whom i am dating advises that we ordered the wrong dish. I advised that if they can not make it right, leave it off the menu.\n\nThe dry pot was ok a bit greasy, the ginger spinich was very sour, the hot and sour soup was not good. I know that hot and sour soup is americanized but this was pretty bad.  Szechuan pepper corns are kind of cool.  If you are a gringo,this will be new. They make your mouth numb. Like could do dental work numb.\n\n The service is quite bizzare. Bipolar as well.\nMy lady advised a server that the soup was not good and take it off the  bill. when the it arrived the offending soup  was not removed from her bill. She asked the waitress whY it was not taken off the bill. The waitress told her to come back later when the manager was back. Wrong answer.  I took care of business.  when aking to take the food home,we had 3 things, she only brought one box. I look at her and said really. I was not taking any food home so i did not  say anything to ethe server.  Wow.\n\nI am a bit wary of this place. 1 good meal, and 2 not so good.
