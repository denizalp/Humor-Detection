Went to watch a playoff game on a Thursday, the manager immediately accommodated our wishes when we were seated too far from the screen. She also brought over Short Rib Firecracker apps on the house for being first time visitors. \n\nThe food was incredible. We ordered Garlic Shrimp Tacos to start and the Fish & Chips for dinner. Everything was seasoned to perfection. It was so hard to choose what to order though! The menu was so diverse. Union Eatery offers things that you've always wanted at a restaurant. The prices are totally reasonable, too. \n\nThe waitress was incredibly sweet, she visited our table the perfect amount of times and never let our glasses go empty.   \n\nIt's pretty loud in here, I wouldn't necessarily consider it a family place. But please check it out! You won't regret it.
