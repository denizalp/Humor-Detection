JetBlue (Las Vegas, NV)\n\nI recently purchased a round-trip flight from Vegas to Long Beach. Total cost was only $60. That's crazy. Car fuel alone would have cost more. Both flights were easy and comfortable with sufficient leg room. Overall, I'm a fan of JetBlue, especially for quick trips. The End!
