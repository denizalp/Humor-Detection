1\/5 for the interior.\n5\/5 for the food.\nAverage: 3 stars. Seems a little unfair because I loved the food that I got here! The law of small numbers sucks and that's math for you.\n\nOkay so upon walking in, you can see clearly that it is just a hole in the wall kind of restaurant. I will go as far as saying that if I were to sit down and eat here, it is like eating in the bathroom of a gas station. I'm truly sorry if I just ruined your appetite. Instead, I asked for a to-go order of a papaya salad and a red curry with tofu. The papaya salad was extremely fresh because the vegetables were very nice and crunchy. Love it!!! Similarly, the red curry had just the right amount of viscosity while being flavorful and delicious and full of fresh ingredients. So good that I ate half the container without even realizing it. \n\nI plan on coming back for more as I'm now a  huge fan of the food here!
