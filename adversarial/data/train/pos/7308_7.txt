We arrived with the idea of getting carry-out but noticed they had nice outdoor seating area in the back of the building. \n\nWe were greeted right away by a smiling waitress with water in hand. \n\nWe ordered the papaya salad ($8), pad see ew with beef ($9.95),  and drunken noodles with chicken ($9.95).\n\nThe papaya salad arrived with two warm jumbo, skewered shrimp, which is a nice addition compared to other Thai restaurants. The young green julienned papaya were crisp,  however was sadly drowned in salt, and too much sauce. There was two shots of juice remaining on the plate. The portion left something to be desired as well. \n\nThe pad see ew contained the correct,  pillow-y rice noodles, generous and equal portions of Chinese broccoli, scrambled eggs, and beef. The sweet and savory soy sauce was distributed evenly among the entire dish. \n\nThe drunken noodles was done very well. It also contained, cooked to perfection wide rice noodles, and sweet and spicy sauce. It was welcoming to have perfectly balanced vegetables and chicken mixed throughout. \n\nOur dining companions ordered the fried rice dish and really liked it. The spring rolls appeared satisfactory, appearing to have generically identical shape and texture.\n\nI would not think twice about coming here again. Next time I'd skip the appetizers and go straight for the real stars of the show - the entrees.
