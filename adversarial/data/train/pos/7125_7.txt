You want me to review La Santisima? \n\nWhat're you, stoop'id? \n\n They're beyond review; they're beyond contestation. \n\nAny reviews in attempt to describe La Santisima, or otherwise are as follows: Effutiation. \n\nIt means \"Useless words\", before you ask. \n\nAnd what I say, what We say about La Santisima, is futile. \n\nDo you know they've been in the news? They've been on national TV. \n\nThey've been hit on by the platinum porcupine himself, Guy Fieri, or whatever his name is. He, like Pamela Anderson, is only famous for His Triple D's.\n\nSo...\n\nThere is nothing we can. \n\nThey're like a living mythological land you can visit. \n\nIve eaten at both locations, hell I've eaten here before they were \"La Santisima\" and were named something else. Didn't know that shit, did you? \n\nYeah, huh, Little trivia for ya. \n\nIve opened both locations  & and I've closed both locations. I've had every Salsa the bar can offer and I've had 16 menu items -- multiple times -- and fuck what I'm saying and just fucking go here! \n\n. . . \n\nWhy are you still reading? \n\nGo! \n\nOk, still don't get it? \n\nSo i'm giving you another word ( It's real before you ask ). \n\nI'll just call La Santisima eellogofusciouhipoppokunurious. \n\n( You can look it up. I'll wait. )
