The sandwiches have taken a huge downhill turn. AVOID, even though they are dirt cheap at $2.99. This location uses stale bread, end slices of tomatoes, brown lettuce and the most minimal amount of turkey possible. Pathetic excuse for a sandwich.If your desperate, it still is Boars Head, so strip the turkey and use your own bread and condiments.
