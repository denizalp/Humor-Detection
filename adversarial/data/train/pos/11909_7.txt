The number one tourist destination in the state of North Carolina.\n\nNot the Biltmore House.  Not the Outer Banks.  Not even our share of either the 469 miles of the Blue Ridge Parkway or 2181 miles of the Appalachian Trail.  A mall.\n\nTo be fair, it is a really big freaking mall, but it is still a mall.  And you have a few thousand of your closest friends on any given day.  Not just around holidays, or on weekends.  But any day, at any time of the day.\n\nAs has been mentioned by just about everyone, the problem is that you are not really getting any great deals here.  As with Tanger - and other - outlets, there are no true deals to be found.  Just a large collection of retail outlets assembled in one place for your shopping pleasure, all trying to relieve you of your money.  And to allow you to wallow in traffic as you arrive and when you want to leave.\n\nYes, you can see movies (as many as 24 of them).  You can go to the NASCAR speed park.  You can visit Bass Pro Shops.  Check out dozens of places to eat.  And walk until your muscles are sore, at which point you can even get one of those water massages in neighborhood six.  Or was it number four?  I lost track, but before I could go back to check, I was kicked out because they had a problem with my Speedo-clad self getting getting too close to the day care.  Something about a restraining order.  I was out of there before I heard all the details.
