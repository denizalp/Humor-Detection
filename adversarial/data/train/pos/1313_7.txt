My experience at the Palomino is largely relegated to the basement, though I have heard the joint is broken up into three levels, including a rooftop patio. We have played here about four times, and each time it has been an eventful gathering of people eager to rock out with metal knights. The food, or at least what I have sampled, makes me sad I haven't eaten more: the pulled pork was delightfully tender, and the burger I had was on the delicious side. An intriguing conceit of BBQ and metal music together in harmony in the heart of Calgary, but there is no better way to do it!
