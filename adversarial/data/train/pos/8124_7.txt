I would like to say part of the reason I bought my home across from freestone was in part to all of the things that my children can do locally one of them being the recreation center included. Upon my first and probably last visit to the Rec Center I had my kids try out the rock wall where the employees seem to take issue with properly explaining the rules for climbing and dismounting the wall as well as how to strap himself in upon climbing my child did break one of the rules which he said was not explained to him and was basically be rated in front of me and my wife at which point is large Caucasian woman came into the mix who was not an employee and proceeded to racially profile and berate and say disgusting things to my family all the while the employee not saying a single thing. I am unsure with his over-privileged white Gilbert soccer mom had put in her Cheerios this morning but it was a disgusting Display , in front of my and her children of exactly what is wrong with half of the people in Gilbert . Unfortunately I found this out about the Rec Center after purchasing my home. We brought this to the attention of the manager of the Rec Center not only about the disgustingly rude visitor but about their snobby employee they did nothing about the situation and did not do her job properly his basic response was oh well.  I will be reporting this to the Gilbert City Council i attended monthly I will also make sure to bring up names as i did get both of them and I do not recommend this horrible place to anybody the weight Center is a joke the place is over packed and  there really is not a ton of stuff to do for children between 8 and 11 years old there . Shame on you  Recreation Center very disappointed
