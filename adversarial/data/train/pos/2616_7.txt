So glad I decided to come here. I haven't been to T.J. Maxx since I was 12. This is my first time coming to a T.J. Maxx in Las Vegas. I was not disappointed! The selection of name brand products was overwhelming in a good way. I was particularly looking for skin care items. They had sooo many name brand skin care and body items. I saved and spent so much money. They had a good selection of perfumes too. I will be back next payday!!!
