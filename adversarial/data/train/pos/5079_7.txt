(Lyrics - Foreigner - Hot Blooded)\n\nIt's at, Hopdoddy, check in and see\nI got my burger at a medium and rare\nCome on Yelpers, do you do more than star?\nIt's at Hopdoddy, at Hopdoddy\n\nYou should read my reviews, to know what I have in mind\nCraft Brews you oughta know\nNow you taste so fine, let me order it on the line\nI wanna go where the milkshakes and the liquors flow\n\nHopdoddy Burger Bar is also part of the Salty Sow own restaurant cause that's how I got my guitar pick coupon and knew about this place!  They make their own patty and buns here! Dang.......! \n\nI came with a friend and like most diners, you order in line and get a table number.  My friend order the Tuna Ahi Burger while I went with the Primetime, even though my heart was shooting for the Buffalo Bill - I love Bison!  Needless to say my Akaushi Beef burger was an experiment and it was okay for my palate.  I didn't really care for caramelized onions cause it really overpowered my truffle and brie cheese.  I had a hint of arugula and steak sauce.  I was really jealous of my friends Ahi Burger!  One of the best I've tasted with sweet honey wasabi and crunchy sprouts and nori chips....yummy!  \n\nOverall, food was awesome-good and the ambiance was perfect for a place to hangout for drinks.  They have many hand crafted specialty drinks plus only locally craft brew beers.  The service is on top of their game here.  Really well informed about their products and treated us with royalty.  That's an A+ in my books! - Enjoy!
