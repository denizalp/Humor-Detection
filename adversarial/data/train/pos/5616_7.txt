I found Johnny Mac's is now participating in the restaurant.com gift certificates. It seemed like the perfect excuse to consume several thousand calories in a sitting when I purchased a $25 gift card for a mere $2 yesterday!\n\nAtmosphere: Dark, dive-esque, while still maintaining a family friendly vibe. It felt nice and homey.. I was digging it. \n\nService: Attentive and polite, can't complain\n\nFood: So to preface this.. there were only 2 of us, but we needed to get up to $35 to use our $25 gift certificate. Being this is a reasonably priced dive type place, we ended up ordering nearly everything on the menu (or so it felt!). \n\nWings ($9.95\/lb): We ordered ours mild, which I think in Johnny Mac's world means \"no sauce\" or \"flavorless sauce\". Despite our ordering mistake, the wings were damn good. I don't even like chicken wings, but these were perfectly fried and awesome. I can't wait to try some with sauce on them next time. \n\nPanini ($5.95 with chips): We tried the philly steak panini. I really enjoyed it. A philly steak panini is a genius idea if you ask me. Fiance complained it needed more cheese, but I thought it was perfect\n\nPizza ($5.99 for 2 slices with a soda): This was absolutely dripping with grease. My fiance loved it.. it wasn't my favorite, but I'd eat it again! I love pizza, but to me this was about average. \n\nFries ($2.95): Fried to freaking perfection! These guys know how to work their deep frier. \n\nHomemade garlic bread ($4.25): This was a miss. Bland boring cold bread with a big slice of tomato with melted cheese on top. Ehh.. not so exciting or good. I expected the bread to be toasted at a minimum.\n\nWashed it all down with a couple of 20 oz miller lights ($3.25)\n\nAll this was a mere $15 with tax and tip when dining with the gift certificate! I'll definitely be back during football season.
