Capriciosa - sausage, mushrooms, hardboiled egg, tomato sauce, mozzarella. The first thing that I thought was... hardboiled egg on pizza? That makes as much sense as mango in a maki roll; preposterous, I declared. Not really, I like weird things - I once sprinkled vanilla ice cream with crunched up bits of BBQ chips, don't judge me, try it! So she cut me off a slice. The savouriness of the generous topping of sausages went really well with the toothsome bite of the roasted mushrooms. The overt sweetness of the tomato sauce was apparent through the cheese and egg.\n\nI didn't know what to think about having chopped up eggs on my pizza. I bit into it and the strangest thing happened. The waitress came over and asked how everything was, and before I knew it, she threw her apron into the air, the other servers pushed the tables aside and the manager jumped down from the second floor via swinging from the oversized chandelier in a choreographed dance. They broke out into song about how eggs have been shunned by the other pizza toppings for so many years and was fighting to find its own identity. It all ended in a rousing crescendo where everyone paused, threw their hands into the air and yelled, \"EGGS!\" No, not really... but eggs on this pizza really stood out - the powderiness of the yolk and that overall taste of egg was the kicker that tied everything together - how I never tried this before, I don't know.
