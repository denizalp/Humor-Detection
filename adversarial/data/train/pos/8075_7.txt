Call me a contrarian, but I just don't get why this place has such good reviews.  I'm a New Yorker by birth and upbringing, and many would agree that New York has *the* best pizza.  But pizza came to the U.S. via Naples.  Settebello's explanation of why their pizza is small, soggy, and salty doesn't add up.\n\nWe got there just before the late HH was about to end, so we ordered a wine and beer.  Six bucks for a draft beer pint is not my idea of happy hour pricing, unless maybe you're on the Strip.  But we weren't.\n\nThe small HH menu listed individual pizzette for $5 each.  We asked our waiter if we'd get more if we ordered the regular pizza off the regular menu.  \"Definitely,\" he said.  So we did, assuming that it would be a normal pizza and we'd have leftovers.  I love leftovers.  Until we were presented with what usually passes for happy hour-sized pizza at other places.  And then watched as a man dining near us got his individual pizza, and realized we'd been had.  Two of those would have given us as much, or more than the one we got.  The waiter's response was that he guessed he'd made a bad call.  Yeah, real bad. I can't even remember the last time we didn't tip a waiter.\n\nAnd that was before we each took a tiny slice of the drooping, sloppy \"big\" pie.  Salty.  Flavorless.  Four bites and it was gone.\n\nThe manager admitted that the Neapolitan style wasn't to everyone's taste, and offered to get us something else.  We declined, and simply finished our drinks and went down the street to Khoury's.  Now that was worth the four stars I'll be giving it. And next time we want pizza, we won't be going back to Settebello.  So utterly disappointing.
