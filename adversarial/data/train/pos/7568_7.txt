I know this is silly but I've been holding back on writting my 100'th review for a special place & this is the chosen one!!!\n\nThis is exactly what I needed after driving 1800 miles. I usually get a massage once a month,it's part of my treat yo self program! I have been neglecting it for a few months & honestly I've been having trouble finding a good massage therapist in Houston.\n\nI found this place on Yelp & found an awesome deal on Groupon. Even if the deal is over,the prices are still very competitve & quite frankly amazing for the quality of work that they do here.\n\nIt's less then 10-15 minutes drive from the strip & probably a 1\/4 of the price that the hotels try to charge you. It's worth getting in your car or a cab & letting them work your knots out.\n\nIt's in a mediacal type building & is very clean. It's a tranquiI space that gives off a relaxing vibe which we all need in our busy lives. Quite frankly,I'll take quality over a fancy frilly salon any day. \n\nI had the pleasure of having Taylor as my therapist & damn that girl is good! There are 3 things I look for in a massage therapist,strong hands,technique & professionalism,I swear if I lived in Las Vegas & would go see her every month. She worked out every knot out & believe me there were a lot. I added the body scrub (back & feet) as an extra for a great deal. I seriously considered asking for an extra hour that I would pay for myself and\/or returning the next morning but we were running out of time on our Vegas adventure.\n\nMy spouse had Jackie & he was equally impressed. Had we both known that we enjoyed our massages so much we would have stayed longer!\n\nI'm considering booking another trip to Vegas just so I can get a massage by Taylor again! I would recommend this place without any hesitation! Support this local business,you will not be disappointed.
