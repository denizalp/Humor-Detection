This place is actually in Mississauga, not Toronto.  Anyways, here it goes: this place is fairly new and it is located in an former bistro place, however, they managed to get the right atmosphere with the decoration and me and my wife love this place, we go there almost every week as they have wings specials from Sunday to Wednesday and they are superb!.  the pizza is also reaaaaally good. The staff is super friendly, so, good food and good service: 5 stars!
