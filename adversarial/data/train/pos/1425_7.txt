After eating a pretty damned good Indian meal at Marigold Maison over in Paradise Valley a few months ago, I guess I just assumed that all Indian food would be as good as theirs. Although after eating here, my girlfriend and I quickly learned that's definitely not the case.\n\nIt's not necessarily that Saffron is bad. I mean, there was nothing blatantly wrong with the food. The server was polite and the place was clean. It's simply that the food just wasn't very good.\n\nWe both ordered some lemonade with ginger, which was absolutely nothing like what we've had before. The lemonade was extremely concentrated to the point where it was so potent that if there was, in fact, any ginger in the drink, it could not be detected.  \n\nFor starters, we ordered a samosa and paneer pakora. Someone on Yelp lists this as goat cheese, but I'm pretty sure they were misinformed. Both were just kind of bland and not quite as tasteful as we had hoped.\n\nFor entrees, we had the chicken tikka masala and tandoori chicken. My girlfriend thought something was off with the chicken. It didn't taste grilled, it tasted more like it was boiled - making it much softer than it should be. We also ordered some garlic naan and rice, which again, just didn't really seem to impress in comparison to what we've had during prior experiences.\n\nFor dessert, we ordered the gulab jamun, which I'm pretty sure no one ever orders, as the server didn't seem to have any idea what we were asking for. Thankfully, it was the one thing that we both enjoyed.\n\nOverall, service was insanely slow for a place that was practically empty. I'd love to give a higher rating to a little local business like this, but when there are much better options available, I don't see the need to ever really return.
