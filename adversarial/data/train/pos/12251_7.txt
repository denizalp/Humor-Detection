There is nothing more depressing than a Friday Happy Hour after a long week at work that is anything but a happy experience. \n\nCame with a group of my girlfriends after seeing that Todds had a great happy hour advertised on their website. Not only did the bartender cut the happy hour thirty minutes short as advertised, but it was more than apparent that the owner, Terry, wanted us out of there. \nKeep in mind, we are all professional young adults and were not loud or obnoxious by any means. The owner had an agenda that she wanted the staff to take care of \"regulars\" and disregard new business. It was insulting.\n\nSeveral women in our group were neglected and forgotten about, we did not receive our food at the same time, orders were forgotten, and my friends credit card was charged five times. While I have no strong opinions about the food, either good or bad, we will not be back because of the service. With 7 diverse women working in different career fields and being well-connected within the Las Vegas Community from Boulder City to Summerlin, word of mouth travels quickly Ms. Terry and I am pretty sure there will not be any recommendations coming out of our mouths.
