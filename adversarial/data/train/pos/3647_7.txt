Don't be fooled by the name, this isn't a sausage-based restaurant but more of a Eastern European grocery with a large deli stocked with plenty of sausage. Deli area also has ready-made items like fresh pickles, salads, schnitzel, and stuffed cabbage rolls. \n\nPricing is pretty fair and the selection of meats and cheeses is good, but I'm hoping they add more items as the settle in. I would specifically like to see olivier salad and a selection of breads- as it is, I need to stop next door at TJ's if I want to make a sandwich with the deli goods purchased here. Staff is friendly and happy to offer samples- ask for the salmon!
