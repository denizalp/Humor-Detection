And the lord said unto Dan: \"Come Forth, and ye shall receive eternal life.\"\n\nBut Dan came fifth, and won a microwave.\n\nWhat to get: Honey Balls from Athens Pastries and a Gyro from Messini.\nHoney Balls?: You heard me.\n\nI had no idea Danforth St Festival existed. I dropped my mother off at Pearson and stopped in to visit a girl I knew from long ago (Toronto girls are amazing, although most aren't from Toronto). Then I was about to head back to Buffalo when I thought, you know, I'll give one of these late night Gyros a try, in Greektown.\n\nHowever, when I got to Greektown all the roads were closed off and thousands lined the streets. I navigated the back streets and found some (illegal) parking from which I was (not) towed away and then I went and mingled in the (massive) crowd full of (sexy) people. Ever since that (fateful) night I have been afflicted with the (unfortunate) compulsion to use (way too many) parentheses (like constantly).\n\nI don't understand how anyone can give this amazing street festival less than a 5. Masses of amazing food options (some overpriced, some cheap), free live music with hot Greek people dancing on stage, thousands of attendees of all ethnic backgrounds, adorable dogs dressed in sunglasses (well, one anyway), and the best Loukamades (Honey Balls) and authentic Athens and Chicago style Gyros (Messini) you could wish to taste.\n\nAccept no substitute for Athens Pastries. Other places sell the Loukamades at this festival but none compare to Athens.\n\nIf this festival isn't a 5-star event then I don't know what is.\n\nAnd by the way, my fave friends in Toronto: Kris first, Jasmine second, Rhonda third, and Dan Forth.
