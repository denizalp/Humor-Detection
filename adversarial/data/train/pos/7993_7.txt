Very cool place in Lakewood with oodles of vintage audio gear. From recording to playback, if you can't find it here, it might not exist. I mean, they have 8-track players, for crying out loud. Keep in mind that this is a vintage place; you may not find vinyl players made in the last ten years here. But...maybe that's not such a bad thing?
