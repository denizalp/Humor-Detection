After an hour and a half at this museum you would have thought I was simply torturing my 6 and 8 year old girls.  I may have enjoyed it more if I were not with them.  Even with the audio starting when  you walk up to an exhibit they were bored.  Though they did enjoy replicating some of the dancing from other countries.\n\nThe hands on room was the only room they enjoyed but even that only lasted 1\/2 an hour or so.  \n\nI thought the museum was expensive and I have to agree that the staff was not warm and fuzzy nor kid friendly.\n\nI was disappointed because I had heard so many wonderful things about this place that I had been looking forward to going for a long time.\n\nOh well, back the the Science Center we go.
