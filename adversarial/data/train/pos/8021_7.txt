I cannot echo Bri's comments enough.  It is not just a one time thing with this place.  It is always bad service.  Too few workers defined to too many tasks.  Put one person behind the register and have that be their only job.  Put one person in the back pulling stock.  Then, put everyone else on the floor helping customers.  I should not have to stand for 30 minutes and wait to have no one talk to me.  Terrible.  I literally wanted to ransack the place as I left.  I will never be back.  Ever.  Hinkleys on Central has my business now.
