An enjoyable experience!\n\nI just wanted a burger.  And a beer.  And McDonalds doesn't serve both ;)\n\nI immediately liked the decor and ambiance at Oh Burger, and as a party of two we seated ourselves at a little table to the left of the bar.  The restaurant was not incredibly busy but busy enough that most tables and a few bar stools were accounted for. \n\nThe waitress was very friendly, our order was taken and the drinks arrived quickly.  Our food was delivered by a very personable man whom we assumed was the manager.\n\nI had the 8oz bison burger with mushrooms, a side of fries and Sapporo (a damn good Japanese beer!). I have to admit it wasn't the greatest burger that I've ever had, but what I really appreciated was that it was not dripping with grease and the toppings were fresh and delicious.  The. Fries. Were. Awesome.\n\nFor a quick bite, I'd go back any time.
