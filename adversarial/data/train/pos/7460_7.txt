Want to give this place 0 stars but yelp wont let me.. \nOur waiter was a terrible host from the start with his greeting.. \"How are you guys? Im bleh eh bleh. He mumbled for some reason. \nNext was how he gave us our food, he threw the bone trays in front of us like we were some kind of animals lol. Next we asked him for ranch, he told us about how it was 60 cents but we didn't mind and ordered it anyways. It took about 30mins to get five ranch dipping sauces. Are you serious ? Lol. And to end the service with a bang, two of my friends asked for a refill on their waters. He comes back with the check and their waters, HALF WAY FILLED AND WITH NO NEW ICE. This dude was out of his mind with that kinda service. Never going to this location again. On the receipt his name was Phoenix, so if you see him just ask for a new waiter. Have a good one and hope you guys take my advice.
