The name is Bond... James Bond. \n\nBond... hip, bold, high-tech, trendy, cool and all those great adjectives you can think to describe it. \nIt does have this different \"swag\" from other lounge bars in Vegas.\nThe vibe is satisfying, energetic and pleasing to anyone that walks in to enjoy a specialty drink, music and the joyful ambience.\n\nBond is a lounge bar done right. The LED lighting visuals are well put together. On the wall window above facing the Strip, you will find sexually stimulating go go dancers dancing for any close observer which comes with plenty of lounge seating so come in and watch them perform their craft.\n\nBond is one of my top 5 bars on the Strip. \nIt makes for a nice pit stop to chill before heading to Marquee or a Cirque du Soleil show etc\n\nBelieve this guys, many sexy women are found walking all over Cosmopolitan and it's places like Bond and Marquee that attracts them there. Am I right girls? Yup, I'm right. \n\nNow I'll end this by saying... Ve disfruta con Bond.
