Coq au vin big enough to feed me and the guy outside. Fresh baked bread. Huge beautiful salad and very nice service. We had a great dinner here for half the price of other restaurants on the same street. Payment process was at the bar, kinda weird... But c'est la vie I guess.\nOh - the location is right in the center of everything in old town Montreal, steps from the Piano Rouge Jazz bar, and just around the corner from the Notre Dame Basilica.\nIf you're trying to save some sous, the food here is the right price and well done.
