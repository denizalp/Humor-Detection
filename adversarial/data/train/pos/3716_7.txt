No internet for customers, no plugs for computers. The decor is nice and blandly trendy; the menu is limited but decent.\nBottom line is, if you're paying $5.00 for a double latte, there are other independent businesses to support and still get your work done. I  haven't been here in over a year; they used to have wifi -- and way better music playing. Not a fan. Won't return.
