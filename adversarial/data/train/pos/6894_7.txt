This is a fun high end sports bar for an older crowd. It's not super noisy but still has a lot  of tv's. The booths are pretty big so you're not cramped when trying to eat or visit. \n\nThey offer a large variety of appetizers. The chips and salsa were good but beware of the salsa. It is super spicy. The pretzels weren't my favorite. I went with the pork sandwich. It was okay. It just needed more sauce. I had a hard time choosing something from the menu. Nothing really stood out to me. That is why I finally chose the pulled pork sandwich. Their fries are the skinny ones which I like. \n\nHowever the names of the dishes were cool. They have a sports theme. I would come back again but more for the drinks and not to eat.
