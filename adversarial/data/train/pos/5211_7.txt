The place is over run by bees!\nWe had enough time to walk in have my daughter go down the slide once then I was stung by a bee. I was just standing watching her. We started walking towards the entrance not there more then 3 minutes. As i had my husband go get our car I stood up front with my son(1) and daughter(3) to have our stuff and persons engulfed in bees. Your staff just stood there watching with  blank stares as I  tried to fight the bees off. No one asked if I was ok. No one apologized for anything or offered us to come back. We paid to walk in and walk out. Awful customer service. I will be sure to tell all I know to avoid this place. Never have I had such horrible service at a place ever. We will be sure to just go to Schnepf its better service anyway. Be sure to check in the photos section towards the end! See how rude this company actually is!
