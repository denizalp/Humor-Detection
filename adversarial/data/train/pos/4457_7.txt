Old and dingy burger stand gracing a part of town many folks would care not to venture over to.  The menu has a variety of options from burgers to wings to Mexican food.  Prices are cheap.  For under $6 I was able to get two cheeseburgers, a large sack of fries and a gigantic Dr. Pepper.  Great cheap eats.  Old school at its finest.  Don't expect anything fancy.  Even the trash cans are old.  If you're worried about the location just drop by during the day (though I don't think the night time would be any different).  My visit was void of the colorful characters mentioned in the other reviews.\n\nAt the end of the day Jimmy Jack's is better than any McDonald's or Burger King.  Give a local establishment a shot.  I shall return.
