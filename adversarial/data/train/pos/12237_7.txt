I have been a long time member and I have never experienced any problems (the few times I've called for service) until, last night. I accidentally locked my keys in my car before going into a social club I had just joined recently. After a few drinks I left to go home and realized what I had done.I called home to see if someone could come and bring me a spare key but, got no answer. So, I called AAA for help. After going through that STUPID menu (Press 1 for this, press 2 for that..etc) I was kept on HOLD for nearly a half and hour. What the hell! Do they only have one person answering the phone for the whole county. I finally gave up and decided to just walk home at around 11:45 at night. It was a real treat for someone 65 years old to walk nearly a mile alone late at night, half tipsy, on a street with no sidewalks(half of which was uphill). It could only have been worse if it were raining. I am lucky I didn't have a heart attack after making it to the top of the hill.\nIf this is the kind of service they give now, I'm going to have to rethink about renewing by membership next year. I damn near crushed the card and threw it in the garbage can when I got home I was so angry.
