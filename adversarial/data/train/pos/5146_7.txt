Macayos is like Chuck E. Cheese without the games. Lots of kids running around. Young servers navigating first jobs with little supervision and varied results. Often bland or lukewarm food that takes an eternity to order and arrive. \n\nAt least at Chuck E Cheese, the kids can run around and bang gophers on the head, or whatever, while you're waiting. Here, you just kind of bang your own head on the table.
