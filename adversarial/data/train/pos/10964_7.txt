Though it's not a Korean restaurant per say, it is a great place to get good Korean food.\nIt is an all you can eat, Korean Grill basically...that for the price, is a great deal.\nIf your looking for more than grilled meat, this is not your place...\nThe brisket, fast cooking slices of beef is great, especially if you eat it with the salad like Ssam.\nThe bulgogi is tasty, but you need to order multiple orders, as the portions seemed too small for 2 to share.\nThe spicy pork, again was tasty, as was the Dakgogi (chicken).\n\nThe banchan is only kimchi, oi kimchi(cucumber), radish & mashed potato(??? Must be for folks who dont usually eat korean)\n\nThey do have some beer & wine. The iced green tea is very good.\n\nTo end it all, the macaron ice cream is very good.
