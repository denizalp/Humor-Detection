OMG what a surprise.\n\nSo, a few years ago this location was a prime buffet so it will let you know that I do not get over to this side of the interstate often, especially when I realized that this was now Ichiban's Buffet Restaurant (has been for more than two years).\n\nAt first, the signage and outside appearance kept me questioning my ability to want to eat here, so I looked to my fellow Yelper's for recent reviews, and this helped ease my fear of the unknown. It was a solid 4 Stars.\n\nWhen I saw a few blue collar workers coming out of the restaurant, I knew I was in for a treat, and for just $6.99 for a lunch buffet, I was ready to take an adventure.\n\nIt was very clean on the inside, and I was very surprised by the sheer number of buffet tables which were completely full with fresh food.  The food ranged from sushi, pork, lasagna, salmon, to chicken, chicken, chicken, chicken and more chicken. I felt I was in a Forest Gump movie with every known possible variety of chicken, and yes, they even offered shrimp, stuffed shrimp, peeled shrimp, firecracker shrimp, grilled shrimp, garlic shrimp.....I think you get the point.\n\nSo, I don't have much time for lunch, but between the fast service, the number of tables and the fresh food, I will definitely make an effort to enjoy this buffet more often for lunch.\n\nThey do offer take out .....you pay by the pound.\n\nI have added a picture for your enjoyment.
