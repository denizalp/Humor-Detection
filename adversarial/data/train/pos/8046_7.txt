Don't tell anyone, but I popped my Smashburger cherry at the new Cotswold location.\n\nThis is Charlotte's second Smashburger. The first is out in the Stonecrest Shopping Center in Ballantyne. So excited to have one near me. \n\nMy current favorite burger is the truffle mushroom swiss. The barbecue, bacon and cheddar bacon a close second. There is even a regional burger: the Carolina chili. Warning: get extra napkins. You can also create your own burger and have the option to pick whichever bun style you want on existing menu items.\n\nDon't do burgers? Get a chicken sandwich. They smash those, too!! The spinach, cucumber, goat cheese and the avocado club are both delicious. Refuse to eat something that use to have a face? Go with the avocado ranch black bean burger. Interesting texture and flavor. The salads are HUGE. \n\nI recommend going here with a friend(s) so you can share sides. The smashfries are tossed in olive oil, rosemary and garlic. You can't go wrong with that. Haystick onions are delicious. SECRET MENU SIDE ITEM ALERT: fried pickles. \n\nThis place is slammed at lunch. The parking lot is kind of small and awkward to get in and out of when it's busy. Note: there's only one way in and our of the lot. I learned that the hard way... twice. Both times while driving with one arm. #slinglife. \n\nThe workers are all really helpful and come to check on the tables often. Your first visit you may sit there and try to remember what use to be here. Spoiler alert: it was a bank.\n\nGreat addition to this neighborhood. I think this location will do well here.
