One morning at work minding my own business and doing work like a good worker that I am, my subordinate came to me and started to bug me about this Firehouse Subs place...and how he has coupons, and that we must go to this place for lunch.  And how it's like a bazillion times more better than any of the leading sub places.  I don't like subs much, so I said I ain't going.  \n\nI went to the copier to make copies and there my subordinate was, hogging the machine, and while I was waiting to use the machine he went on rambling on about how clean Firehouse Subs was, and how friendly and freaky fast they were.  I told him I'm not interested in subs.\n\nI went to the loo to do my afternoon two like I normally do, one minute into nuking the toilet and like a scary movie I learnt my subordinate was in the stall next to me as he started to ramble about how Firehouse Subs quality is decent, and how their food was tasty and how we must go and that he'll pay for me with his dad's black coloured credit card.  I should of put on my poop shoes..  Shoes specifically for wearing to restrooms so you can't be identified.  \n\nI eventually broke down and we went to this Firehouse Subs, and you know what?  Everything he rambled on about all morning was true!!
