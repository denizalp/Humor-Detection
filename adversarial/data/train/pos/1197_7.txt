So incredibly awful. I can't get over the fact that I wasted over $500 for my family to attend this concert.  Why was it sold out in San Antonio??? Who really likes this or calls it music? It was a bad joke.  If you like long, dyed, straight hair that flipping around is the primary dance move of this group, coupled with extremely bad music then this concert is for you. I am seriously shocked that anyone likes this stuff. I am so sad to have wasted so much money. UGH!!!
