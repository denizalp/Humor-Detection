Some of these reviews just crack me up. Here's the 411 on Fuzzy's. This is a cheap little taco joint on the ASU campus. The taco and tamales are great, the beer is cold and there's plenty of hot sauce to go around. If you're looking for an upscale, clean and trendy taco place MAYBE YOU SHOULDN'T GO TO A PLACE THAT SERVES DOLLAR TACOS IN A PLASTIC BASKET! Rock on Fuzzy's!
