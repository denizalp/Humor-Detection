I have been going to Chik-fil-A for at least 25 delicious years. If it wasn't for the awesome food and the ideal location here, I would steer clear of this place. The customer service is nowhere to be found. There is no sense of urgency and no one knows where to stand in line. It is a total free-for-all as far as the counters go. I have had to fight my way back up to the counter to grab my food after waiting (and waiting and waiting). In general, Chik-fil-A is run with quality food and that \"my pleasure\" attitude. You won't find that good attitude at this location. What stinks is that I love the food too much to stop coming here. Don't even get me started on their milkshakes.....drool.\n\nYou got me, Chik-fil-A. Your delicious fried and grilled chicken have won again.
