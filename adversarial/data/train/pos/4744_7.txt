Dormont Florists assisted me in making another Valentine's Day special for my Lady Kay. On that day of grand romantic gestures, a dozen roses were delivered to my girlfriend's workplace without a single glitch. I phoned them a week in advance, told them what I wanted, paid for the bouquet with my credit card, and 7 days later, I'm The Thief of Hearts...\n\nhttp:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=_v5svRnN21Y\n\nThank you Dormont Florists.
