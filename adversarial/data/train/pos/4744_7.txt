Chiludos is my pick for the best tacos in town.  I have gone there at least 20 times in the past year simply because I know every time, my tummy will be happy!\n\nChips and guac plus queso.  Their chips are crunchy and a bit thicker than your average chip.  Guac is basic and does the job without any addition of lime, tomatoes, etc.  Get some with your meal.\n\nTacos, what can I say?   Chorizo continually on point with the right amounts of spiciness and meat.  The carnitas, carne asada, shrimp or fish tacos - you just cannot go wrong here.  The plates arrive hot and meat is never dry or overcooked.  I like 'em with extra onions and cilantro, topped with their hot spicy salsa.\n\nLastly, finish that deliciousness with either a beer or a Mexican soda.   \n\nJust a quick note about service, they could do a little better on speed and timing as on several occasions we had to ask for the whereabouts of our food!  ;)
