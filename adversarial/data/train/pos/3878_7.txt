Last week I had to settle for drive-thru from here twice.\n\nFirst of all, the service has improved a good notch or three.\n\nSecondly, their new Garden Sensations are pretty spiffy. I tried the Baja Salad and the Spicy Caesar Chicken Salad and was impressed with both. The chicken on the Caesar Salad was shockingly tender. \n\nHey, I gotta be fair. Wendy's did good for a change.
