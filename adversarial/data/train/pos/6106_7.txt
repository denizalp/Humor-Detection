looking to get my car painted read review here and i decide to stop by and ask about an estimate and here's the experience: as i arrived to the shop doors where opened so i walked in,i noticed there wasn't a single person there or cars being worked on (during normal business hours)then a guy looking like shaggy from scooby doo comes out of a custom painted old volkswagen van, i asked if he worked there he said yes he was in charge and asked what i needed i said i was looking to paint my car I DID NOT MENTIONED what my car was or what color paint i was looking for and he said \"ill charge you $1500\". not once did he see my car or asked the paint job i was looking for
