Happy Father's Day 2013!!!\n\nThe gurlpren took me here for Father's Day and I admit, I would have never found this place because it's located smack in the middle of a residential area.  We arrived right before noon and it was still a little quiet, especially for great day like Father's Day.  Dining for us was outside and even though we were in the middle of 100+ degree Vegas weather, we were kept cool with the shade and cool mist. The service was great, staff was attentive, and the ambiance was relaxing.  My GF had a view of the lake, which was the relaxing part. My opinion, I had the best view. \n\nAs for their food, lets start with their menu.  Their menu for brunch was simple and prices are what to expect from a French Restaurant.  Actually, their prices for what you get are pretty good. I got their Steak & Eggs, which is also served with some home fries. The steak was the highlight. I would guess about 6 oz of well seasoned, well prepared, and thinly sliced steak.  Normally steak & eggs come a little dry. Not here, their steak was juicy and delicious.  For my pre-steak meal, I got a cup of their French Onion Soup.  This was delicious as well. It wasn't overly salty and had enough of an onion kick to it. \n\nThis was my first time here and I was impressed with their service and quality of food.  I'm still curious what dinner is like here so I'm going to have to come back. I'm also appreciative to my GF for surprising me with memorable Father's Day brunch.  1OAK!  \n\nSteak & Eggs:  http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/user_local_photos?select=bsDfORivIAUj9CIkPL5FyQ&userid=y3FcL4bLy0eLlkb0SDPnBQ\n\nFrench Onion Soup:  http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/user_local_photos?select=YnmW7qmYq_QgVaAjqr99_A&userid=y3FcL4bLy0eLlkb0SDPnBQ
