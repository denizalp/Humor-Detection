I've been to the Madame Tussauds in London many years ago and I thought it was ok, and that's basically how I feel about the Las Vegas Madame Tussauds. I thought it was a little overpriced even though we got a discount for being Nevada locals. Our tickets were $19.95 each but had we ordered them online, then it would have only been $13.95. Didn't know this until we got to the ticket counter. So if you're a Nevada resident and you want to check this place out then I suggest ordering tickets online and save yourself $6.00 a ticket.\n\nSome of the wax figures look pretty dead on such as Will Smith but the wax figure of my favorite actress looks nothing like her, IMO. We went around 9PM on a Saturday night and it was not busy at all which was good because we were able to look at everything in about 20 minutes. And since it wasn't busy, it was easy to take pictures with all the figures without being in anybody's way. \n\nI watched an episode of Ghost Adventures once and supposedly this place is haunted. This wax museum is located at the Venetian and Venetian now stands where Sands Casino once stood many, many years ago during the mob days. \n\nI would recommend this place to tourists if you run out of things to do in Vegas because it is kinda cool to see but try to get some sort of discount if you can. I believe the actual cost is $27.95 a ticket.
