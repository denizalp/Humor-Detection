The last time I visited Kabuki was at least 2 years ago. There are too many sushi and happy hour places in Vegas to venture out. I do agree with the other reviewer it's not as a happy hour price, but the service and the quality of food were good which made up for it. Thanks to Kelly, she definitely has people skills! \n\nHH sushi ordered were Alaskan Roll, Asparagus Salmon, and Albacore Sushi tasted great. The portion of fish to rice was good. The Paradise Roll was tasty and I like the garnished sauce used (not a HH item). In fact, I love all the sushi sauces they used and that goes with the the calamari rings as well. The Tokyo Buns both had great flavors, but it would have been an excellent items if the buns were served warm. The slaw that came on the side I thought was fantastic! The Sake Sangria had too much ice and dissipated the flavor. This drink would have been great garnished with mint leaves.\n\nThis is my favorite Kabuki, located in the Tivoli Village. I like the patrons that dine here compare to the younger\/tourist crowd at the Town Square location. There are great restaurants and shops in the vicinity. The short distance drive from home also makes this an ideal location.
