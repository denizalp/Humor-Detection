Fat-ass-burger is among the best burger chains I've ever had and certainly will be the death of me if I continue to devour these wonderful sandwiches.  Each burger will pollute your arteries with endless clots and empty your wallet in a hurry.  The actual establishment is nothing to rave about, but the array of burger combinations are to die for.   There is no bare bones about it, its the most successful yet simple concept there is to be:  Its a burger.  Its big.  And its fat.  Its delicious as a result!\n\nI heavily endorse the KingFatBurger (i.e. Royal Fatty) and with the Ultimate Big Fat Deal.  Its disgusting when you think about it but oh-so-good when you put it in your mouth.  The greasy texture is completely ignored as the gorge temptation gets the best of you.  Vegas is the city of sin and fun, might as well have fun with your sins and eat it too.  Yeah, I'm still talking about the burger.
