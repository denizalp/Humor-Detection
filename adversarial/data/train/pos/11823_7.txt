Really Bell Road Toyota? Really? \nThe finance department is a joke here, the receptionists is the only one with an ounce of customer service in her, and her trying to help usually ends with the buffoons in the glass cage yelling at her. \nNot cool. \nI can get absolutely nothing done when I am here. Once you purchase the vehicle you no longer exist.  \nEven while purchasing these guys are complete jerks.  My husband is by no means an easy guy to deal with when it comes to dollars and cents, but their behavior is truly horrifying.  When a deal was finally reached for my husbands new car I went to get something out of his old one, I dropped some change and the finance guy that had worked our deal looked at me and said \"want me to get you husband to come pick that up, it's clear he needs every cent he can get.\"\nI should have told them to call off the deal then.  My mistake. I tried to write it off as one guy having a bad day, but turns out this is model behavior for their finance guys.
