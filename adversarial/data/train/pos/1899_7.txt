Im upping Flannerys another star folks..  Came here before the Boys From Co. Hell show and had pints and some grub.  Bartenders were stellar and super friendly.  Pints came quick and kept coming quick.  They have coupons in the local coupon book and took em with no problem.  More stars from me if they actually played Irish music and they had more Irish food.  Live music could be better too...I mean, how many times do we have to see New Barleycorn sing the same, lame unicorn song?  They DO have Paddy whiskey and HP sauce which deserves another star for sure!  So, if ya want a kinda-Irish pub with American sports and music on..give this place a go.  Sit at the bar though folks...service stil is better there.  Is fearr Gaeilge briste, na Bearla cliste!
