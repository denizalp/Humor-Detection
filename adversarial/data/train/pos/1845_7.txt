Smiths produce is always the worst and always very near expiration.\n\nPrices are always high no matter what you buy.  Big markup here.\n\nThis place is always a zoo.  I'm amazed at some of the trash that shops here.  Ex-strippers yelling and cussing at the top of her longs at her 3 little brats is the norm.  As well as trashy, fat, sloppy, criminal looking people blocking the aisles as if they were raised in a trailer park.  Unbelievable.  I expect this at WalMart but come on people - PULL YOURSELF TOGETHER.\n\nSome of the gal's that work there are friendly and attentive so they get an extra star.\n\nNot a smiths fan at all.
