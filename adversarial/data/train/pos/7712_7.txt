What a dump!  Just got back from a weekend at the Orleans and it was awful.  The casino, hallways and elevators were dirty.  The restaurants inside the hotel were awful, poor quality food and horrible service.  Our room overlooked the parking structure and was a \"premium\" room which was supposed to have been recently renovated.  What a joke, the room was large however it was dated and the bathroom door, which was a pocket door, was broken.  It would not shut all the way or lock.  If you like a comforter on your bed, forget about it at this hotel, you get two sheets and a thin blanket. What little security we saw had their hands full the whole time we were there, people laying in the hallways, room hopping, inebriated individuals that couldn't find their room and oh happened to be in their underwear.\n\nif all that isn't enough let me say this part of town is really bad.  I would not feel comfortable walking anywhere.  \n\nNever again will we stay at this hotel.  Just AWFUL!
