Can I admit something?  \n\nI'm really not a dive bar person.  I know, I know....it doesn't make sense!  I'm cheap, I love cheap drinks, and this is the mecca of cheap drink places.  I like to mix and mingle at bars, I like to drop it like it's hot.  If I dropped it like it's hot here I may get slapped.\n\nI know this place is like thee dive bar spot in the Burgh, but I was just...meh.  I think the fact that smoking is still allowed makes a huge difference for me.  I go home smelling like an ash tray and yearning for a dance party.  \n\nThe only draw for me is the wide selection of beers and the DIRT CHEAP prices!  I just lean over the counter and stare at the huge beer refrigerator, scan my eyes over the bottles until the holy beer spirit hits me and I go....THAT ONE!  It's almost like my own personal beer tasting.\n\nWill I go back? Probably.  Will I like it?  With enough drinks...YES!
