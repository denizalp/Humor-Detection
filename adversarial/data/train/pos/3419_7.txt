Racks on racks on racks! \n\nGreat venue space with tons of potential. Came here for the Capital Cities show and was blown away with how much space is actually here. \n\nGreat sound from the stage and ample bars to wet your music loving whistle. The bartenders are a little slow and the drinks are a little pricey, but these things can be remedied, I mean they just opened (it hasn't even been a month). \n\nIf there's a show happening here and you're semi-interested swing by, if you're not impressed, Downtown LV is a hop skip and jump away.
