This place is too legit....\n\nI mean damn man, who is the mastermind who comes up with these ideas? Then to be able to execute a freakin Brulee Burger on the reg... It's just amazing. Your freaking fries taste like lays BBQ chips which is in itself a miracle. \n\nDon't get my fat ass started on that Lucky Charms shake either, I almost left my wife because she drank it all. \n\nYou guys are the best and an awesome local business. This is what makes Phoenix great! \n\nKeep up the good work!!
