Canada Day reminded me of all the wonderful things Canada offers: cute girls, poutine, and the CN Tower.\n\nThe Tower is certainly worth a visit. From the observation deck on a clear day, one can take in Toronto in all its glory.\n\nI first came here awhile ago, and it left its mark on me. Yes, it's touristy, and the lines can be long, but you can't beat that view. The view may be a bit nauseating to those with a fear of heights, but it's not entirely unreasonable. Just remember, you're behind glass!\n\nI'll be back to try the restaurant.
