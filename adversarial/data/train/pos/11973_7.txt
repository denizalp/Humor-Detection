Sila Thai is a great lunch spot for those of us that love Thai food. The food here is traditional Thai. The decor looks like many Thai restaurants I've been to. It has that...we're in transition with our decorating look...which we all know...is the look of almost all the Thai restaurants we've been to. \n\nI had the Pad Thai and have to say, it was exactly what traditional Pad Thai tastes like. I loved that they bring you a hot and sour soup as an appetizer, it was delicious and the tofu was firm but flavorful. I enjoyed that the Pad Thai came with a miniature spring roll and a little red cabbage on the side. The hot scale goes from one to five stars. I got a major head shake of \"no\" when I even asked how hot the five stars was. I ordered the four star...and my sinuses are completely cleaned out. I would recommend three stars for most people.\n\nLastly, the service was attentive and very fast. My water stayed full...which is a huge factor for me at Thai restaurants. If you're not familiar with Thai food...I'd do a little homework before you go here. This is not a restaurant owned by born-and-raised Americans...so the conversation is going to be limited.\n\nVery happy to have you in Rock Hill Sila. I hope you do well!
