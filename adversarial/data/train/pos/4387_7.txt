I think this place has potential to be amazing.  (I have a feeling my 8th grade PE coach used to say the same thing about me as I never was able to do a full pull up back then )  But anywho...  the drinks are great.  This one time I ordered an unsweetened black ice tea with boba.  But I asked the watier to put fresh lychee in it.  (This is not on the menu, and he was confused at the order, but he made it happen!)  It was delicious and the fresh lychee added a slight sweetness to the drink. \n\nSo I have a boring life and had been talking about this drink for quite some time, and I brought a friend here to try it with me.  Another worker was there, and said I couldn't have this because there is no such thing.  I told her that I have had it before.  That didn't help my argument.  My friend thought I was crazy and I was making orders up.  So I have yet to be back, my heart will break if I can never have this amazing drink again.
