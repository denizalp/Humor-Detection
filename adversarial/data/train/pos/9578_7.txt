I'll post a review of my one happy hour experience there. I intend to go back for more. Again and again.\n\nThe happy hour runs from 3 to 6, and it was suggested--no--urgently pleaded to me by other regulars that I go just for one dish available half-price during that time: The cheeseburger. It's honest-to-god prime rib ground on premises, served on a ciabatta roll with a selection of yam and potato fries. \n\nAnd yes, it is delicious. \n\nIt was so delicious  that I want to go back to try the rest of the happy hour menu. It was so fully worth the $7 that I think I would have felt satisfied paying the full $14. I want to work my way through the menu and report back each time.\n\nWhen you enter the hostess politely asks if you came only for drinks (most of which are half-price during HH) or food as well. If it's only drinks you get to sit in the hip-a-riffic wine bar to your left, where stylish Helmut-Newton-looking pictures of fabulous babes with wine wait to stimulate you. If you are going to avail yourself of the food menu you are directed to the Cadillac of lunch counters, where all places are set with fine linen and silverware. You get to watch chefs prepare your meal in front of you. Sound exotic? It's more like Kresge's circa 1974, but the experience of eating brilliant impeccable food from a five-and-dime lunch counter is thrilling in a way.\n\nThe downside--if there is one--is that there is basically none of the \"vibe\" that you'd get in a more sporty place. This is a nice, quiet, high-toned place, So maybe \"happy hour\" is a misnomer. Maybe it's more of a \"Maslovian Elevation Hour\", where one can sit and reflect that if one has time and means to enjoy a perfectly lovely prime-rib cheeseburger for $7, life isn't so bad after all.\n\nSo yes, thumbs up.
