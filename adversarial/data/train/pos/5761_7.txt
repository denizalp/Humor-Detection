I have to give this place 5 stars because quality and effort need recognition.  The food and atmosphere were more of a 4-1\/2 but we need more places like this in the suburbs. \n\nI can't believe the \"critics\" that give this place 3 stars whining about pricing, side dishes, and whatever else.... Blah blah blah.  There is a Burger King down the road with 1.49 nuggets if you trust the are not made of horse meat. \n\nThe atmosphere is hip. The service was reasonable and the food was \"downtown- city\" quality.  Bread was perfect. Tuna melt was full of flavor. People watching through the massive front glass window was unique.  Will be back to support creativity and fresh, quality food.  Spare me... This Yelp crowd is starting to take itself way to seriously. Please! \n\nWife, son and I had a nice lunch and will be back.
