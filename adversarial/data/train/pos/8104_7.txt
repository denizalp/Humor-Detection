This is a good place to enjoy with a young family.  It was worth the drive from the strip.  My 8 year old and my 18 month old son both enjoyed it.  We used our Las Vegas Power Pass and it included:\n\n-Individual Pizza (the size of Pizza Hut's personal size)\nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/sEjy65M87W8dLka1YD_-JQ?select=NAiG8Ozop5GlKJzayZjxng#J6SYEQ4Ysf0iiIu_UWre_g\n-1 soft drink\n-4 arcade games\n-1 ride ticket\n\nThey also serve different types of food as well.  Such as sandwiches, chicken wings, chicken tenders, and so forth.  \n\nThey have 4 different tracks to enjoy here.  ALL OUTDOORS!  Map of the different go cart tracks.  \nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/sEjy65M87W8dLka1YD_-JQ?select=NAiG8Ozop5GlKJzayZjxng#T-yZPr8Iw6fTIZdO1o56Ug\n1)  Go Carts\nMinimum height is 54\" but kids under that can ride with an adult with no extra charge :)  This is the longest go cart in Nevada.\n\n2)  Sprint Kart Speedway\nMinimum height is 54\".  Kids under the height are not allowed to ride with the adults. \n\n3)  Adult Gran Prix Cars\nYou must have your license.   They are larger than the other karts and they go much, much, much,  faster.  They have to only Adult Gran Prix in Nevada.  It doesn't go as fast as the electric carts that I've rode on at Podium Raceway located in Hawaii.  But you can feel the difference from the other go carts.  \n\n4)  Kiddie Karts\nMinimum height 38\" and maximum is 54\" .  My oldest son has also driven the electrical carts at Podium Raceway and he had a look like, \"really, this is how fast this can go?\"  \n\nBesides go carts this place has different carnival type kiddie rides.  All geared to please kids 10 and younger.  \na)  Super Fun Slide (it was only a 1\/4 of the ticket)\nMy toddler had a huge smile on his face while we took turns sitting him on Mommy and Daddy's lap and sliding down the big slide.\nb)   Tornado Twister\nc)  Dragon Roller Coaster\nd)  Bomber \n\nInside there are over a dozen of arcade games, tickets to be won, and prizes to be redeemed.  There is an area in the party room where you can take a picture for free.  It kept on telling me that it didn't go through but I found it in my in-box several days later.  It didn't work on Facebook. The staff was very friendly and welcoming.
