So I used to go here when it was good.\n\nI stopped because it got dirty, the staff stopped caring and all of the good trainers went elsewhere.\n\nSome time went by and I heard they vamped things up so I decided to give it another shot. They talked me into signing up for the year for $300. I really wish I hadn't.\n\nSince I've signed up I've been just three times because I'm NOT IMPRESSED. In fact, I'm grossed out. \n\n1. It's dirty. I've never seen anyone cleaning ANYTHING. The floors in the room are this weird material it's like how do you even clean that? I've never seen it done. I needed to shower after a class and that locker room is disgusting. I don't think they've ever cleaned the curtain. \n\n2. When I came in I forgot my little card and he didn't even check my ID. It's like anyone can just say a name and boom you're in. He also didn't charge me for the towel or mat, which is inconsistent with the other times I have gone and they do charge. So that's annoying- but I'm glad I don't have to give them any more money.\n\n3. They make you (yes, make) tip the instructors. Clearly because they can't afford to pay them what they deserve.\n\n4. I hate to say this.. But I prefer that my instructor to be in better shape than I am. I want to look at their body and be encouraged to work harder... And the last time I was there, this wasn't the case.  \n\nI want my money back. \n\nFingers crossed I don't get some weird infection.
