I got to come here for free as a chaperone for a school group, and that's as much as I want to pay. While it's nice to have a larger aquarium in the Valley, the pricing is just ridiculous. Just to get into the aquarium normally would cost $35 per adult, $30 for teens and $25 for \nkids. Once inside, they gouge you with ridiculously high food costs that make sports stadiums seem reasonable, there are extra fees if you want to walk underwater and if you want to see the dolphins or the butterflies you have to pay far more. Annual passes might be a better value, but honestly this aquarium doesn't have enough exhibits to bother returning.\n\nAs for the exhibits, even though it's the largest aquarium in the Southwest, it feels very small. The rotating theater is probably the coolest thing, but if you've done it once, you probably don't need to return.\n\nMy advice is if you want to see fish go visit Bass Pro Shop or Cabela's and see them for free. That way you can save up your money and take a visit to a good aquarium like Shedd's Aquarium in Chicago or the Monterey Bay Aquarium in California.
