Good little place for lunch.  Went there with three friends after seeing their sign on the sidewalk.  Most of the food was excellent.  The pork belly was good - some sort of BBQ riblet thing was even better.  The heatlamp food mentioned by another reviewer though was subpar and I'd stay away from it except for the riblet deals which seem to only get tastier under there.  Topped lunch off w\/some halo halo for desert that was just fantastic.  If you've never tried it - it's a sort of ice cream plus condensed milk and ice and other goodness.  Wonderful stuff, looking forward to going back....just need to translate the menu first.
