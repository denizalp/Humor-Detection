While I love the ambiance and vibe of Federal Galley (the bar is an old bank vault--COOL!), this review is going to be focused on Michigan & Trumbull, one of the awesome concepts currently in residence at Federal Galley.\n\nI am newly obsessed with Detroit-style pizza. Seriously cannot get enough. After trying out the wares at a Yelp Elite event recently, I had to return for more of what Michigan & Trumbull has to offer.\n\nI ordered the St. Aubin Sausage pizza, an order of the Teader Fries, and the Garlic Knots. \n\nThe pizza featured some delicious sausage, broccoli, and red sauce. The crunch of the broccoli brought everything together and the fennel sausage had the perfect amount of spice.\n\nThe Teader Fries are out of the world--just like your favorite BBQ chip but better. But the best part is the house made ranch sauce for dipping. I want to bathe in that ranch. I want to top everything that I eat for the rest of my life with that ranch. If I drowned in that ranch I wouldn't even be mad about it.\n\nFinally, the garlic knots. These would be better described as garlic rolls because they are much bigger than other garlic knots I've had. Doused in garlic butter, these garlic knots were out of this world. Perfectly golden brown but incredibly soft in the middle, if I could use one as a pillow at night I would, but in the morning it would be gone due to sleepy munching...\n\nMichigan & Trumbull is fabulous! I'm going to be holding my breath for them to get their own brick and mortar restaurant and then I will live there.\n\nThank you, Federal Galley, for sharing amazing food with Pittsburgh!
