Excellent towel service, large pool with two sides one for drinking and the other deeper also a Jacuzzi like tub. The pool has reserved chairs for table service and a bar of ordering drinks. \n\nI went up to the bar keep and asked for waters. He said what do you say? so I switched into German and asked him again for water. He said can you say please? I asked him what if I was from a country that is not used to these phrases. He told me it was universal. I like being given lessons in eddicate from las Vegas at a pool bar. I did not tip him afterwards.
