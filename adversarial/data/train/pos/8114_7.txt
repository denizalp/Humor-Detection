I have been in coaching with Mike Ferry personally, his sons and his other amazing coaches for over 10 years now.  They have without a doubt changed my LIFE!  Through this rough economy Mike is there for his clients constantly... almost on call.  He gives out his cell phone and either answers or will call you back as well as responding to emails.  Mike leads by example tirelessly traveling around the world doing seminars, writing books, daily emails, calls, tv, coaching individuals and groups.  His work ethic is to be admired.   He is definitely \"tough love\" but if you do what he says and follow the system you WILL make money...LOTS of money but the choice is yours....whine and complain about why it doesn't work or jump in both feet with blind faith, putting your excuses and bad habits behind you...then you will succeed.  I know...I did.  My income has more than doubled thanks to the skills, systems and accountability I have learned from this company.  No one does the work for you...it only works if YOU do!  I prospect daily for 3-4 hours every day and list 100+ homes per year.  Mike does not pay any of us to share our story.  He doesn't have to....we are all SO grateful to this wonderful, caring man for what he has helped us create in our lives that we are happy to give back in whatever way we can.  Feel free to call me and I will tell you the truth about MFO.  (or talk about Naples, FL real estate...lol)  239-248-8000.  Susan Heller, Loyal Customer
