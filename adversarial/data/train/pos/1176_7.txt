Unless you really, really have to see a film when it's first released, then it's worth waiting for it to come to Tempe Cinemas.\n\nThis is basically the neighborhood budget movie house that gets films shortly after they leave the mainstream cinemas. \n\nMovies are $3 and popcorn, candy and drinks aren't cheap, but they're not quite expensive as the mainstreams either.\n\nTuesdays movies are $2 and I believe sodas and popcorn are $2 each as well.\n\nTempe Cinemas doesn't seem to get overly packed where you really end up with a seat you oppose. It also doesn't fill up with kids. \n\nThe floor is a little stickier than a mainstream theatre and the parking lot (in a strip mall) isn't as big as others, but the value is good, their website is informative and there's always a live band performing in the lobby. Although it seems to be the same act every time I go.
