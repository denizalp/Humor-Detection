My first experience with Steak 'n Shake....and I was very underwhelmed (I hate using \"underwhelmed\" because it reminds me of Michael Kors). After hearing and reading so many great reviews I was expecting better.\n\nI have come to realize that I just cannot eat a well done or fully cooked burger. I need to eat my meat pink or bloody, or not at all. Also? I prefer the bun to NOT be smashed when it arrives on my plate. Thank you very much. \n\nThe french fries were okay. They probably would have been good if they were actually hot or even lukewarm. But they were almost cold. \n\nThe service wasn't the best. We had to ask twice about the status of our milkshakes. They didn't arrive until we were nearly finished with our meals even though we ordered them at the same time. I was REALLY excited about the side-by-side chocolate\/banana milkshake that I ordered. Way too excited. I think it was called \"choconana\". I was really sad and disappointed with my milkshake when it finally arrived. Choconana? More like fake-o-nana. The banana flavor was that really icky pretend banana - reminded me of the way the bananas taste in Runts candy. Major sad face over that one. \n\nBlah.
