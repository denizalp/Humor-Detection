We rented a house from Ameri-Dream and were initially a bit worried as there were several minor issues with hot water, light fixtures, sprinkler system, garage door opener, etc. Because of this, I quickly posted a less than stellar review. Happily, I can report that they are really doing a good job. I realize now that the house was likely vacant for several months and that lead to a fairly long list of issues. I received a call to schedule a next day repair visit, within an hour of my emailing our checklist of fixes. My wife is very particular and she found everything to her liking by noon. That's 5 problems all resolved by mid-day. I'm almost tempted to up the score to 5 stars but will give it a couple of months, just to be sure.\n\nLas Vegas has a crazy real estate climate right now... To say nothing of the climate itself. Accordingly, there are things you might encounter here that at first glance seem a tad negative... Credit\/background checks, demands for cashiers checks\/money orders and maybe a bit higher depost\/move in expenses. Plus the weather can wreak havoc on any property over time and there are going to be nice houses that have been left empty for a while.\n\nGive Ameri-Dream a chance... It really looks like they are focusing on customer service.
