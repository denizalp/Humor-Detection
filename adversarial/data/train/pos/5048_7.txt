I adore Grand Luxe. It is one of my favorite restaurants in Los Angeles and one of my favorites in Las Vegas. I was very surprised that they opened one at the Palazzo, since they have one in the Venetian which is less than a 5 minute walk. \n\nBut regardless, my boyfriend and I havent' been to Grand Luxe in a long time and so we decided to go and have dinner there. We parked at the Venetian and upon entering the Venetian we saw a HUGE line at Grand Luxe. I hate waiting for a long period of time, especially just to eat. So I said, let's go try the one at the Palazzo. I was hoping not many people knew about the second location. I was semi-right!!!\n\nWhen we walked towards the Grand Luxe location at the Palazzo, there were only 2 people in front of me. Once I gave them the number of my party, they sat us immediately. SCORE! No wait! I was a very happy camper indeed.\n\nI ordered my usual Sunday Night Pasta. It was delicious. Slightly a bit too salty for my taste, but still good as I remember it to be. My boyfriend ordered the Lasagna and he LOVED it. I think it is his new favorite item on their menu. He just loved the sauce. I tried it and it was delicious! \n\nAlthough we were stuffed, we saved room for dessert because I am a HUGE Creme Brulee fanatic and hadn't had it in such a long time. So we ordered that and it was also delicious. You get one regular vanilla creme brulee and one chocolate flavored creme brulee. When you eat it together, it's just so yummy in your tummy!!\n\nOur waiter was also very nice and helpful. So service was good too.\n\nI love Grand Luxe!! I had so much leftovers. Portion size is HUGE! So many choices and so much good food!!!
