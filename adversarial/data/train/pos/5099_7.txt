Solid date night meal. We arrived at 7:15PM and were quickly seated. After perusing the menu we opted to have a couple glasses of plum wine and ordered our entrees. The wife ordered the Kung Pao Chicken which is served with spicy sichuan chili sauce, peanuts, green onion and red chili peppers. We also asked for some chili sauce to dip the chicken for some added heat 4\/5. I ordered the Crispy Honey Shrimp which is battered and covered in a tangy honey sauce with green onions 4\/5. Rice accompanies both entrees so we opted to have a mix of brown and white.\n\nNice attentive server quick to refill the waters and inquire how the meal was progressing. It's been some time since we came here for happy hour and now after seeing the menu and the new cocktail listing, I am sure we will be back soon to partake.\n\nEnjoy the pics and come experience the Asian fusion yourself.
