Five star beer! Five star service! Four star location.\n\nI've enjoyed the Triple C products in a few different drinkeries around town and always been impressed. So when Jeff sent me an invite to an event here (the Panthers game), I decided that it was time to get the beer right from the tap.\n\nA few tables and a bar for drinking, but there's no food here. Yes, they sometimes have food trucks come along and that's awesome. But if you're looking for a meal with their great fresh beers (like they do at OMB), then you might be disappointed.\n\nI loved the Cajun spice beer and the Golden Boy Blonde is excellent. Try them all.\n\nIt's within walking distance to the New Bern Lynx station.\n\nYes, they sell and fill growlers.
