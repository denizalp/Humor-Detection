After a meeting in Oregon on a warm day I stopped in to OFroyo after perusing the menu and seeing an option for Italian ice soft serve. I was intrigued and have been searching for something to replace my cravings for Rita's Water Ice (I never fully acclimated to life out east, but some things stuck with my move back to the midwest). \n\nUnfortunately the menu online didn't match what they had in store that day, so there was no Italian ice to be had. I did try a mix of regular fro-yo (vanilla, caramel, and chocolate) and the flavors and consistency were good. There were an array of toppings (though, like the yogurt flavors, not all that are listed on the site) and I added a little mix of goodies to my yogurt mix. \n\nTheir idea of \"bottomings\" is cute (cookies\/cupcakes\/etc you can use as a base) and the staff is always cooking up delicious looking combinations on their Instagram page. My modest portion without a ton of toppings was a few bucks and seemed right for the price. Lots of heavy toppings\/bottomings can quickly drive your price up, but that's true of any pay-by-weight frozen yogurt shop. \n\nIt's been some time since I've been in, but I'm looking forward to giving it another try now that the weather is warming up again and hunting down that Italian ice!
