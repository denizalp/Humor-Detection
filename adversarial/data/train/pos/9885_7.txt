Since my usual hair stylist moved away, I've been on a quest to find a new hairstylist. So yesterday I went to Carmen Carmen, because they needed models, so I thought \"Sure! Who wouldn't want free haircuts!\". Well ladies and gentlemen, I have founded my new hairstylist! \n\nIn the beginning I was kind of worry because I thought the hairstylists were newbie, but dang I was wrong! Cameron (my new hairstylist) have been doing hair for 6 years!! Holy Zeus! He explained to me that they needed models because Carmen (yes, Carmen, as the owner of Carmen Carmen) was coming to show new trends and technique. Since I'm a easy gal, I told Cameron that I just want my hair to look cool, and be able to tie it up when I need to, after Cameron and Carmen discussion on the hairstyle that would suit with my personality, which Carmen describes me as energetic and fun. Cameron gave me the best, and I do mean THE best, haircut, and with the help of Carmen, they made my look chic and awesome! \n\nOverall, Carmen Carmen salon is clean and modern, so both gender feels welcome. Carmen is an awesome owner that makes you feel fabulous or in italian, bellisimo! And I really like how they stay on trend! Cameron is so sweet too! And he's really talented. So I'm definitely coming back to get my hair done by Cameron again.
