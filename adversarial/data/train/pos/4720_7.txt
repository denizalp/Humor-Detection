1st helpful hint:  If you walk in and see a male standing at the counter, just turn around and walk back out and go elsewhere.  If you see a female standing at the counter, walk in, place your order and get ready for yummy food!\n\nI've been to Troy twice now.  The first time we visited, a girl was at the counter and she was so helpful.  She explained what our options were and that we could have our salads made like \"Greek\" salads if we wanted.  We ordered, we tried various things and it was all tasty.  She brought us our plates and came back to check on us, all was well and we left talking about what a good experience we had.\n\nToday we visited again and got a male at the counter who first tells us that their fryer isn't working and that anything fried will take a long time to prepare...  despite the fried zucchini being listed on the daily special board??  He then tells me that I can't substitute anything for the \"combo\" all I can get is french fries, house salad and a drink.  Then he said I could have the potatoes instead because of the fryer issue.  I ask if I can forgo the salad AND the potatoes and just get tabouli in place of both (thinking it's not fried and would be easy to substitute) but to my surprise, he says that's not an option.  So either I purchase a platter for $8.99 + drink or I purchase an entire appetizer order of tabouli for $3.95 in addition to my lunch combo.  Neither of these are a good deal for the customer, so I miss out on having my beloved tabouli all together  :-(\n\nLast time the girl brought us our food; this time he hollers for us to pick up our food.  My friend ordered the same thing (veggie pita) on both visits, but got different sauce each time, so now we don't know what is actually supposed to come with the veggie pita...  no consistency there  :-(\n\nThe straw that broke my back is that when I went to the counter to ask for more taziki sauce, the male actually said it would be $.50 for another taziki sauce!!   I looked him in the eye and said \"Really?!?\"  after all that with the fryer, and you spending our time telling us all the things we couldn't have instead of trying to help us get what we came there to purchase, now you're going to fight me over fifty cents??!??  That's just bad business; letting $.50 hold up a $10.00 meal?  He gave me the sauce.\n\nI've heard through the grapevine that the same people that own Troy also own(ed) the Kabob Grill on East Blvd...  If that's true, then Troy will have a hard time being successful because the men at the Kabob Grill ran me off years ago being so rude and snappy to me when I'd eat there.  It seems that they don't enjoy fat ladies; unfortunately they seem to very much enjoy make their feelings known.\n\nNewsflash:  fat ladies eat alot.  Fat ladies also have friends that eat alot.  Fat ladies enjoy meeting their fat friends at restaurants and eating alot as a group.  If you're a restaurateur = you should befriend the fat people as they're the ones that pay your bills and tell all their fat friends how you treated them.  You also never know when those fat ladies are responsible for the company wide newsletters that over 200 local employees read to learn about new restaurants to visit for lunch!\n\nUPDATE:  The owner of Troy responded to my review the very next day.  He was kind and apologetic, which I sincerely appreciate and respect, so I wanted to 1) thank him publicly for responding and 2) share his response:\n\n\nDear Ms. Karby K.\n\n\"I am sorry about your bad experience in our restaurant.\nEverything was messed up in the restaurant because of the fryer issue yesterday. The kitchen staff was having difficult times handling the orders since the fryer was not working. we have fixed it yesterday. Sorry for that.\nWe do respect your opinion.\nI felt so sad, i have opened this place only 7 months ago, and we are trying to improve our service and food every moment.. I wish you had talked to me first before posting here, which will sure ruin our business.\nNormally, we do not serve to tables, we do so if the business is slow or there are only few customers. As you see this is counter order and delivery restaurant. which we do not promise for service. \nExtra tzatziki we do not charge usually , i do not know why my cashier asked you that, sorry.\nLastly i do not have any relationship with kabob grill or others. i am new in country just came two years ago.\nThanks for coming, sorry for your bad experience.\n\nkind regards\nRasim\nPs: Sorry for my poor english, my mother language is Turkish.\"\n\n\nBased on this seemingly sincere response, I'll definately go back and give Troy another try...  maybe we really did just catch them on a bad day.?.  either way- I'm willing to give them the benefit of the doubt  :-)
