Really sweet service and a tasty little pastor taco if you happen to find yourself here grabbing some goods from Wally World. It is casual, counter-service spot with a snazzy painting of a warrior and a TV station that's tuned to a Spanish station. The food did not have the appearance of being super fresh, but the pastor had a good flavor and the rice and beans fulfilled my comfort food hankering quite nicely. It was cheap and fast, and I ate it all. They offer fish tacos. Enough said.
