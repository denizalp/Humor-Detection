Well, believe it or not folks I have never....EVER been to the Mandarin before....for their all you can eat crab legs that is!\n\nHaaaa see what I did there, you thought I was going to say the other thing, but seriously, If you're reading this review and you've ACTUALLY never been to The Mandarin OR any Mandarin for that matter, I suggest you stop reading here, jump in your car\/bike\/public transportation and go eat at one of their locations....\n\nOk are you back? So while the MSG\/food coma over takes you, your eyes get heavy and you groan like so many of us \"why the F%^& did I eat so much!!!\" Fear not friend this feeling will soon pass (in about 20-30 min) and while it does listen to me recap the joys of the one special I truly fell in love with - Crab Legs!\n\nBrief recap, Mandarin is consistently decent white chinese food. It's never great BUT like going to a McDonalds, you always know what you're gonna get, you always know what to expect and every so often the mention of this place will lead you to craving...\n\nThe all you can eat crab legs was well worth the $25.99, especially on the side of all the other food this place offers. The crab is perfectly cooked and even pre cracked for you to obtain easy access to the succulent meat within. BUT what's better than these giant steamed legs is pouring yourself a big ole bowl of melted butter to dip the meant in.\n\nI'm pretty sure that I ate more than my $26 worth in crab legs....technically if you think about how much you get at say the Keg for $35, you really only need to fill your plate up with crab legs alone once......I filled my plate up 3 times....plus had other food....and soup.....annnnnd ice cream.\n\n.....hey hey hey now, no judgement, I exercised that day ha ha ha.\n\nCrab legs come and go but mandarin will always remain the same :)
