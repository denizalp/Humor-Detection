DEFINITELY MY FAVOURITE CINEMA IN TORONTO.\n\nI've realized lately that I'm not nearly as avid a moviegoer as earlier versions of myself. However, when it's time to sit in a comfy cinema with popcorn bucket in hand, Varsity is the only place to go.\n\nThe clientele seems to be a bit older than Scotiabank Theatre (nee Paramount) and AMC Yonge\/Dundas, so I tend to have an infinitely more enjoyable experience. They offer the pre-paid online ticket purchase option, which cuts the lineups to nill, plus they'll validate your underground parking at Manulife Centre to $3, which is awesome on a cold winter's night.\n\nThe best part of Varsity is the VIP option. It's well worth the $4 approx. surcharge, but the perk are great. WARNING- the screens are significantly smaller, hence the title 'Screening Rooms'. They offer in-seat service including popcorn and alcohol sales (finally Canada!). Best of all, there's super-comfy seats and small crowds so you can really immerse yourself in the experience.
