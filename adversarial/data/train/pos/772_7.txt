What an abfab little beer find in Matthews! \n\nNot only do they have some pretty awesome stuff on draught (they had a 2013 Vicaris when I was there on Sat!), but they offer lots of local brews as well.\n\nThey also have beer by the bottle or can and though it isn't a big space, they have a surprisingly robust selection! \n\nThey don't serve any food, but they work w\/the Pizza Exchange Depot (which is delicious!) who will deliver pizza to you here at no additional charge, which is such a great concept! \n\nThe staff here know their beers and I was lucky enough to be there when they opened some great (and rare) bottles and gave out samples to those of us who were the barflies for the night.\n\nI had come in ready to get caught up on some reading while enjoying some beers on tap, but ended up having an evening full of great conversation with fellow beer enthusiasts! \n\nI also really loved that they let you \"try before you buy\" with anything they have on tap. I was glad I did with one of their pricier offerings as it did not taste like I thought it would and was thankful to not to have purchased. I like that they offer 8oz, 12oz, and 16oz sizes so you can decide how you want to enjoy each brew and how much of it you want to enjoy! They also do an excellent job of serving each respective beer in its appropriate glassware (and no, this is not snobbish or pretentious, it actually does make a difference as each glass is made for particular styles to accentuate and amplify each style accordingly). \n\nTo say I was pleasantly surprised and impressed would be an understatement.
