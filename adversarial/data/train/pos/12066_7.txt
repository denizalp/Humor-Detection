Went out golfing on Black Friday.  Tee time at 2 pm.  By 5:30 we were on hole number 11 and in the dark.  The wonderful gentlemen in the pro shop decided it was a good idea to let groups of 5 go out.  Staff is very blah and will not even attempt to smile or make you feel welcome.  Driving range is a big sand pit that is tough to hit off of and the 500 club thinks they are elite and should charge for a bucket.  \nOverall a very bad experience and I will just head out to Vistancia or one of our 20+ courses in the NW valley.
