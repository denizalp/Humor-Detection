What a fun spot to catch a drink! \n\nLast week I met up with a friend who was staying at the Mandalay Bay. We walked around, looking for a bar to have our next drink at and then this place caught our eye. We headed inside and took a seat at the bar. Service was quick and friendly-- our drinks were ready in no time. My friend is an old fashioned connoisseur and so naturally I just had to have my first one with him. Maybe his expert opinion would be different, but I thought it was pretty good. Thumbs up from the newbie!\n\nMy visit here was short this time but I would definitely be back to try the food. At a quick glance around the room, I saw a few plates that looked pretty good. Steampunk, octopus, and cocktails in a skull glass-- who can say no to that?
