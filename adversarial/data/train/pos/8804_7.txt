\"Excuse me, what type of wood is this magazine rack made of?\"\n\nThe first thing I heard as I walked into the 400 square feet of pathetic fuckwittery that is The Monocle Shop.   To be entirely honest,  the quote kind of sums the whole place up.\n\nThe customer who asked the question looked entirely serious as he perused and pondered the comically overpriced small wooden box. \n\nYour jaw just drops to the floor at the intensity of the idiocy.   It feels like you're walking into a Kids in the Hall sketch.\n\nEverything about this place is wrong.\n\nThink of it as the antithesis of a Walmart.    Instead of a wide selection of low-priced, high quality goods.... you get a handful of pixie dust and magic beans skewed over a minuscule retail environment.    The friendly greeter has been replaced with a spandex-wearing charlatan dickhead and there's nothing to look at or buy.\n\nI'm all for expensive goods and high-end fixtures...  but there's nothing here that even remotely looks or feels any different than stuff you can get better versions of at the dollar store.\n\nThe perfect balance of clueless and pretentious. \n\nMonocle magazine has been striving to reach the 'young-affluent-jetset' for quite some time.   With brand outreaches like this, it's going to quickly become known as \"The Economist for people who can't read\".    \n\nVapid and vacant.   \n\nLike bashing your head against a very expensive faux brick wall.
