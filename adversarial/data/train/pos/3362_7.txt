This place is called Express Oil Change and has a side business called \"Same Day Mechanical.\"\nI had my pick up in for coolant leak.  They said lower intake manifold gasket cause.  Book time to repair 3.6hours.  Should be done in 1\/2 to one full day.  I agreed.\nIt took them 5 (five) full working days to repair.  YES \"FIVE\" days.\n\nShould have know what to expect.  Took 1\/2 day for diagnosis.  Told would be done next day.\nDay 2-not done.  Excuse: only one mechanic on duty.  No other A-techs.\nDay 3-not done:  Top of engine in pieces.  Mechanic says \"I used to work for GM dealer.\" \"I want to 'focus' on getting this done.\"  \"I'm gonna stay late tonight and finish.\"   \"Will be done by noon tomorrow.\"\nDay 4-not done:  Top of engine STILL in pieces.  Mechanic says \"It will be done shortly\".  SHIT AC compressor was not even in place.  No F****in way it could have been done.\nDay 5.  Go in.  2 other A-techs working on it.  Mechanic who said he needed, and wanted to, focus on it was not there.  It was his day off.  Was not done.  They finished up after hours.\n\nTruck working fine now.  Runs well.\nPrice OK.  Big jobs like this never cheap.\n\nSo, if you want just a quickie oil change.  Good luck.\n\nIf you have a more complicated mechanical issue they can get it done, but NOT in a reasonable, timely manner.\n\nOh yea, on way out a lady brought in her FIAT to get an oil change.  5 A-techs stood around in trying to figure out how to get oil filter removed.......\n(5 big guys standing around this lil car looking at each other.  Hilarious.)\n.\n.\nBe careful my friends\n.
