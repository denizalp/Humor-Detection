Do not shop here. Ever!\nThis is the final sale shop meaning that if your husband surprised you with the nice present these people won't allow you to exchange your item for another size. This needs to be reported to BBB. The most disservice to a consumer business. \nI hope they go out of business. They need to learn what customer service is from Tiffany's next door.
