You can tell how great a place is by the line outside. And let me tell you, the 10 times I've been here, there has always been a line in front of Sweetie Fry. \n\nThis place is one of a kind! I love their unique ice cream flavors, like goat cheese honey walnut, french toast, & maple bacon. All of which are freakin delicious! Btw, if you pair the french toast with maple bacon, it's like a breakfast but in ice cream form! How cool is that?\n\n The fries from here are also pretty freakin awesome. I've tried the garlic parmesan fries before and have not forgotten about the dish since. \n\nI definitely recommend this place!
