I just want to briefly mention how 7 of us passed out in the most ghetto room in the Flamingo while we had a freaking suite at the Venetian we just left empty. Oh drunken decisions. \n\nWe had the most gorgeous baller ass suite here I did not even get to utilize since I left a day earlier than all my friends. At least they got to sleep here the next night! Absolutely breath taking view of the pool. There was a TV in the bathroom and everything! Everything about the Venetian is so luxe! Not to mention the suite was only like $250\/night?! It was the nicest room I've ever seen! \n\nTons of trendy restaurants downstairs and pretty things to look at everywhere you turn. Quintessential Vegas hotel!
