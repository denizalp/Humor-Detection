Quite surprised by the amount of mixed reviews here. \n\nI came with my family on Christmas Eve and prices were $10 more for lunch buffet costing us $45 a person, compared to $35 typically. It's pretty steep considering the variety isn't as extravagant as Bacchanal's, but in my honest opinion, it was worth it for a few reasons. \n\n1. Bone Marrow - this is rare to see at any buffet and is one of the main reasons I gave this place a 5\/5. I'll admit it's a bit greasy and heavy on the salt, but I enjoyed it and went back for more.\n2. Bulgogi - Yes, they had bulgogi when I went. It was really flavorful and juicy. \n3. Ox Tail Pho - when I went to get the Ox Tail Pho the first time, all of it was gone. But when they restocked it, I grabbed myself a huge chunk meat. This was hands down my favorite. The meat was so tender and moist. It was not fatty at all. It's a must when you go. \n4. Drinks - During the holiday, they gave out Egg Nog which was more noggy than ones you find at the drug store. It's legit stuff! They also had green juice to cleanse your palate and it was surprisingly refreshing and delicious. My favorite was their raspberry apple! It had the right amount of sweetness, but also felt healthy as well. \n\nOne thing I was a bit disappointed with was their dessert section. I have a major sweet tooth, but nothing really wowed me. I'd say my favorite was their Heath Bar Chocolate Covered Strawberries. \n\nAll in all, I would say it's pretty comparable to Bacchanal. Sometimes it's not about the quantity or variety because it can get overwhelming.
