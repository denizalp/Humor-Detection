As consistent as the chain is, this Harvey's was the first Harvey's to ever turn me down for 8 extra pickles on the side. Rather, they untruthfully claimed that they are not allowed giving me more than 6. It does little to weaken my love for Harvey's, but this certainly isn't one of my favourite locations.
