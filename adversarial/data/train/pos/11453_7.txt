Don't piss on my head and tell me it's raining.\n\nPreface.   I could not wait to try Foskoskies, two separate friends told me I had to go try it.  I finally had a day off and zipped over there for a much deserved glass of wine and a little lunch after a three hour tour at the DMV.  \n\nI order a glass of Prosseco and I tell the server if it isn't fresh, I will take the Sauvignon Blanc.  Simple.  She serves me flat prosseco and tells me it's a new bottle.  Really?  And then she got pissy because I didn't drink it and asked her to take it off the check.    I will post the photo of my sparkling it looks like still wine in a Champagne flute.  It's kind of funny now.  \n\nOn a lighter note, I ordered a burger and fries and the fries came out piping hot.  That settled me down for a moment.  I will go back and give it one more try before I completely write it off because lord knows I have been pissy to people too in my 20 years of waiting tables.  Waiting tables makes you mean sometimes.  Grrrrrrrr.
