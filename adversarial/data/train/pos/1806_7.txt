Can you say TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE? ok all together now 1.2.3! \n\nThey place you on hold for over 5 minutes and are very rude! I called to ask them about a order I placed online and apparently it doesn't matter that I click on future order, it still went through and they made it early. When u explained my situation, the lady on he phone was very rude. I would not recommend this location to anyone. They need to hire new people that have customer service skills. Right as it stands their workers suck! Learn some manners! \n\nAlthough they cancelled my order I'm afraid that they might just leave the pizzas in the oven and when I pick it up in 4 hours it will be the same one they just finished baking now. No thank you!
