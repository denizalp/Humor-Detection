I'm really very disappointed with Del Friscos.\n\nMy boyfriend made a reservation for Valentine's Day a month in advance, & we still had the only options of the 3:00pm or 9:15pm reservation. No big deal, we understood that this was a busy night for them. When we arrived the restaurant was half empty..... \nThe Valentine's Day menu did not offer much in the way of options. Steak, steak, & more steak. I get it, it's a steak house. I decided to go with the 8oz lobster tail. Which was surprisingly HUGE, I was not complaining. Boyfriend got a steak cooked to perfection.\nThe table stayed dirty. If at a less expensive restaurant, I would never even comment on this, but this stands out to me when the check is going to be $150+.\nDrinks were very weak, but of course very expensive.\nSo now is when things really started spiraling down. \nWhen we received the check my lobster tail was $120!!!!! Jeeze!! I asked the waiter to explain & I guess he had rang in the 20oz tail. They did correct this, but blame shifted it on us. I WOULD NEVER EVER SPEND $120 on a lobster tail.. That's just bonkers.\nBefore we got the check, my boyfriend went outside to inform valet that we were ready to go.\nI noticed a long line of people at the bar waiting for their cars. 30 MINUTES LATER! Still no car. 45 minutes later NO CAR! Boyfriend outraged spoke with the manager, who was sarcastic and had a serious attitude. Valet lied and said that they had pulled the car around, but reparked it due to no one coming to get it. Lies!\nThe manager could only respond saying it was a 3rd party valet company.... Okay so what? If they suck this bad, get another valet company. \nWe will not be back. There are plenty of high end steak houses, with more class in Charlotte fortunately. Capital Grill remains my favorite.
