Just the right kind of place with the right kind of vibe. PublicUs welcome me from the downtown area with a knowing look: \"Here you are, weary traveler. We'll serve you up a heaping dose of realism, with a blueberry scone on the side.\"\n\nWe went through the line and ordered some lunchies. It moved quickly, but we arrived in the nick of time, as the noon crowd followed right behind and clogged up the spot pretty quickly. The kind feller at the cashier station was friendly, quirky, and not easily embarrassed. They were oozing smiles there, and they walked around in the craftsman-like aprons. Hard to know if they were about to pour coffee or turn pine on a lathe. Hint: It's the coffee. I'm pretty sure.\n\nKudos for having normal human sized glasses for water, and for having a creative area to dispense it from mega-filtered taps. The avo toast looked serious, but I opted for the Cubano and it was fine. Chips weren't fully crisp but were fine. It's a coffee shop first, so don't expect va va va voom from the food, but it was good.\n\nWe grabbed a seat by the window and sat at wavy tables under trees that grew up from the center of them. Movers and shakers (not gamblers nor ruffians) hang out here. I jumped on the WiFi and laptopped like a boss for a while. Then we went to the street where we parked and were on our way. Put it in the rotation, laptop warriors. This is a sweet stop.
