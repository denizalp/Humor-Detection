I was referred to Madge here and was heart-broken after I left with fried hair NOTHING like I asked for. She took off to do this other guy's hair as he was in a rush and then she left me under the hot lamp too long so the bleach made my hair all jelly like (which is REALLY bad) and it started snapping off! My hair is still brown too! She has no experience with the latest trends and NO CLUE regarding bleach. Do NOT let her near your hair- I promise you'll regret it!!
