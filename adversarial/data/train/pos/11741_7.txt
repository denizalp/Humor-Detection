This place is great!...at making you wonder \"What happened to all of the good car salesmen?\"\n\nWhere do we start....\n\nMy brother and I walked in here a while back trying to buy a Jeep Wrangler.  After spending an exorbitant amount of time talking through the deal, they had agreed upon a price.  Somehow.... the deal magically increased by $2,000!!! And I didn't even get a kiss with that.  \n\nNot to mention that all of the staff members that were encountered had a...aura of incompetence that followed them.  I'm fairly confident that one of the salesmen I worked with at the dealership was strung out on only God knows what, I think his name was Matt.  \n\nSo after all this, I was working with the used car manager to get more for my trade-in, the finance manager (Howard I believe) was making hand signs behind me to draw the attention of the used car manager to not offer any more for my trade-in.  I was frustrated, so I left.  Later, I received a phone call from cowardly Howard (what an unfortunate name by the way, bless his soul), I confronted Howard on his childish tactics, if there was nothing more to offer for my trade-in, simply have the decency to tell me \"no\" and that would be that.  Instead, he made hand gestures to the used car manager.  At that point, Howard was a little feisty, he yelled at me, said \"F**K YOU!\" and hung up the phone. Swiggity swag. \n\nHoward also called the sales rep I was dealing with, Matt (yeah, the strung out sales rep) the new guy and said he has no idea what he's talking about.  I would surely hope that someone tasked with the responsibility of selling cars that cost that much would know what he's talking about.  This comment also speaks volumes of the lack of customer services skills and team work this dealership has.  You never discredit your coworker\/staff to a customer, simply apologize, and honor whatever the coworker said.  \n\nAll in all, this place is a poor, absurd excuse for a car dealership. I yearn for the day that they hang the \"Going out of business sale\" banner across the front of the dealership, as that would be the best thing that could possibly ever happen to this place.  Deuces.
