Reddstone double-charged my credit card for a dinner I had there -- and never responded to my multiple requests to fix the error. They didn't even offer the courtesy of a return phone call or email. American Express ended up crediting my account, but only after Reddstone ignored Amex's requests for information on what had happened. By the way, the service was fine but the food was only so-so. Reddstone is officially my least favorite restaurant in Northeast Ohio.\n\nP.S. I've read reviews that refer to the owner of Reddstone as \"nice\" and \"friendly.\" Really? I beg to differ. I don't think it's very \"nice\" or \"friendly\" to simply blow off repeated requests by me AND American Express to correct a duplicate charge.
