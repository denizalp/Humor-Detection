Dude, if you are on a budget -- the Luxor can't be beat.  All these other overpriced hotels give you the same square feet for a higher order price, so unless you are going to take advantage of some perk at the hotel ... it's not worth spending an arm and leg for a hotel room in that you will barely use... and instead invest that money into shows, nightlife, dining... etc... and the Luxor and the Monte Carlo do just that.  \n\nHonestly, you didn't go to Vegas to stay in the hotel room... you bought the  hotel room just to hold your crap while you party like a rock star OUTSIDE the hotel room!
