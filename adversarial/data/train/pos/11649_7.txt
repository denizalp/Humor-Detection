Well, a fish taco craving hit the other day.  What to do?  Go to Rubio's (since it was Tuesday and all), right?\n\nDecided that I wanted some fish tacos, stat!  Drove down to this location because it's not too far from home (closest Rubio's to my house) and was just off my path on the drive home from work.  I walked in, ordered 2 regular fish tacos on corn tortillas (no white sauce) and 2 fish taco especials on flour tortillas (no white sauce).  Total was just over $8.00 (On Tuesdays, regular tacos are $1.75 and especial tacos are $2.00).  Took them out to my car to dig in.  Here is how they were..................\n\nRegular Fish Taco-  Rubios makes a pretty damn good fish taco.  They give you a decent sized piece of fried fish inside a corn tortilla, and top that with some cabbage and their red salsa.  They even include a lime in there.  Taco was delicious!  The red sauce and cabbage pair well with the crispy fried fish.  Their tortillas aren't my favorite in the world, but they still are passable.  For $1.75, hell of a deal!\n\nFish Taco Especial-  I got these ones on flour tortillas.  Same ingredients as the regular fish taco, but these have a little bit of cheese and guacamole on them.  I prefer the flour tortillas here over the corn ones.  They have a better chew and hold the ingredients a little bit better.  Same great taste...crispy fish, cabbage, red sauce and the addition of cheese and guacamole made them a little more creamy with a different texture.  If you like cheese and\/or guacamole, for the extra $.25, it's well worth it.\n\nOverall, I liked my tacos!  Service was incredibly friendly, and the price was right.  I don't crave fish tacos often, but if I do in the future, I will head back to this Rubios.
