I had a bit of a wait for my flight so I decided to stop by Lucky Streak.  I ordered a mimosa and I was a bit famished so I decided to order the Jersey Mike's Sub Turkey sandwich that also comes with chips.  I wasn't impressed with the sandwich at all, no flavor just really bland and dry, the person sitting next to me ordered a different sandwich and had the same experience.  The staff however is fast and friendly, full of smiles!
