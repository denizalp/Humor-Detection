lol im a regular here, its convenient, its local and there really isnt much to do in scarborough but shisha and eat. but these guys have enough business thanks to drake where they can put a little more effort to wipe down their tables periodically so im not sitting on a mountain of ash every. they could seriously benefit from some women in that place. hire meeeee dammit, i have to wipe down those booths with a baby wipe every time im there, they may as well just pay me! oh also, the new raised prices...commmonnnnnnn -_____-
