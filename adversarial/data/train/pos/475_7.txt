I wrapped up my stay at The Valley Ho by grabbing brekkie at Cafe ZuZu before heading out. Everything was delicious from the coffee to the farm fresh eggs, yummy bacon which could NOT have been more perfectly cooked and delicious sourdough. A lot of their ingredients are locally sourced so my brekkie was really a delicious conglomeration of all the goodness Arizona has to offer.\nWhat made this brekkie out of this world however was the Frosty Ho-Jay which is fresh squeezed Orange Juice blended with Vanilla gellato. I swear, my eyes almost rolled back in my head it was THAT good. Orange Julius can kiss my ass after this cosmic experience. Fantastic.\nI highly recommend Cafe Zuzu...if nothing else DO NOT leave until you've had the Frosty Ho-Jay. I can't believe I enjoyed a drink that much that had no alcohol in it.
