This ice cream shop doesn't just fix your ice cream cravings, it saves relationships. Every single time my girlfriend and I fight, this is the go to spot for that make up ice cream. My relationship would have been over ten times over if not for Taiyaki, their impressive ice cream, but also their AMAZING customer service. Once they saw the cold shoulder she was giving me, they comped our ice cream and said don't worry, we all got bad days. Don't slack, save your relationship today.
