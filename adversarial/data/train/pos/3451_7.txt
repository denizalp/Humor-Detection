This place is about as funky and cool as it looks on the outside. When driving on Roosevelt, I've always passed the GreenHaus and wondered what was inside. Yesterday, I decided to actually stop in to answer my question. Imagine this...an art gallery meets boutique meets an antique shop. It's a eclectic mix of all three and it's run by an incredibly interesting and artsy owner. I walked inside and was immediately greeted by the owner who was working on her latest idea, burning beautiful images into a piece of wood. You've got to see it to understand. She was friendly and gave me a quick background of the store. She's an artist and her goal is to salvage antiques and \"broken\" items and transform them into art. Her creative mind goes places most of our minds wouldn't even dare to. Don't expect her to reupholster an old chair. Instead, expect her to take that chair in its current state and create it into a piece of art that you will put up in our house. She not only makes her own items to sell but she also commissions her work out so if you have something you'd like transformed, stop in and she will come up with an idea! \n\nI browsed through the store and enjoyed looking in every nook and cranny. They have everything from interesting paper products (like post cards with beautiful sayings) and notebooks to door handles, old keys, type writers, home decor...you name it, they probably have it or can find it. Everything is pretty reasonably priced as well, but even if you aren't in the market for anything in particular, just stop in and simply look around. Your creative juices will start to flow and you will most definitely learn a thing or two about art. I didn't buy much, but left with two inspirational post cards and a small notebook to keep track of my crazy to-do list. I also may be coming back to have to owner work on a piece involving an old button collection I have. Stay tuned!
