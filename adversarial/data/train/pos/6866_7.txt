If you ever get stuck in the North Ridgeville or Elyria area and are craving Thai food this place is definitely passable.  It has better Thai food than some of the pretentious overpriced places I've been to on the Eastside that serve green linguini in their noodle dishes and pass it off as \"Thai.\"  I was on a date at the Thai House with a Chinese girl and the owner\/waitress asked my date if she was Thai too!  My date was insulted and I had great laughs!  The Thai House is also close to Super Wal-Mart.  One of the greatest places for people watching in Ohio I've found so far.
