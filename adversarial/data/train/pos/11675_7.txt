I had Film Monkey do my wedding over a year ago in San Diego. Biggest mistake of my wedding. They said they would use wireless microphones, they did not. They were extremely slow in responding to my coordinator, had to send multiple e-mails before they gave minimal responses. They gave me a contract that stated extra hours were X amount per hour. I asked for 2 extra hours, and they quoted me an extra $30 on top of X. I told them in the contract it already stated how much it was per hour, and they just told me it was still $30 extra. It was too late to find another videographer at this point. \n\nWhen I finally received the video, it was tacky. The name wasn't even correct, it was for some other couple. If I could give 0 stars I would.
