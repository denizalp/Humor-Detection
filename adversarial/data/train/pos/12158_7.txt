The food is very good.  The service is very good.  It is small (yes, cramped) and the tables are all right next to each other and hard for the staff to maneuver especially when customers are going to their table.  Some may say romantic but it is very noisy.  Just a good place to dine.  I do say dine not to eat.   We started with some wine and asked the waitress to wait before we ordered our appetizers.  She was very accommodating.  We ordered our appetizers, I split the beans and greens with sausage with my significant other.  Hard to go wrong with this appetizer.  We then ordered our main course and I went with one of my favorites, Spinach and Ricotta Ravioli that comes in a tomato cream sauce.  \nThe pasta's rock at Girasole.  \nYou get the soup or house salad with your meal.  I had the salad because it is one of the fresher and better salads in the area.  The salad has a combination of fresh greens, some chickpeas, olive and a great house made dressing.  \nIf you are in a hurry and don't want to dine this is not your place.  We came with a small group to enjoy the food and each others company but one in our group kept wondering about the time and was annoying.  Just come enjoy the food and the people you are with.
