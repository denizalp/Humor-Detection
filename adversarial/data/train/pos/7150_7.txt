Tamari is trying to classy up Lawrenceville, which isn't so much good or bad,just hard; Lawrenceville's best characteristic is its eclectic funk, and that doesn't seem to accommodate Tamari's sleek design and modern aesthetic (READ: waterfall thingy behind the bar and recessed lighting).\n\nBut aside from it's wonky neighborhood placement, and the fact that it's a \"fusion\" restaurant--a buzzword I try to stay away from when it comes to the table--Tamari knows how to make some great robatat (bacon and quail egg--yes please!), melt in your mouth pork belly and decent sushi. The tuna tartar was very miss though, like, slightly-warm-raw-fish kind of miss. \n\nI like to grab a post-work cocktail there because it's chill and you hang out at the bar by yourself or meet friends and they make an AMAZING lychee-tini. Actually all of their cocktails are good and you can tell the bartenders like their work so they make good company if you're just relaxing over a big fat drink.
