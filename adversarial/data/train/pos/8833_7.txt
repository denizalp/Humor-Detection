We ended up here after I made friends with this cute local girl named Natasha over a beer at the Rex Room. We instantly clicked and she invited my bro and I to this hip club for her cousin's birthday. After getting cheated out by a cabbie (which the fare starts @ $4) we ended up in front of the Tattoo Rock Parlour and I really wasn't sure what to expect. \n\nUpon walking in I could see how this place has potential but I wasn't too impressed, in fact I was overwhelmed with \"club\" music and tons of trendy people and a $7 cover.  I was impressed with the ample seating and decor.  I would not recommend drinking and getting a tattoo but apparently you can do that here.  One last thing that I noticed was that their mixed drinks were never topped off and weren't that strong so you really don't get your money worth.
