They've fixed up this mall, but they have net been able to take the \"Gerrard square\" out of Gerrard square, if you know what I mean.\n\nThey have a decent variety of stores for a smaller mall, including Walmart, Staples, a Dollar Store, EB Games, a very well placed EI office, Home Depot, a Grocery store and so on.  On the food side they have Tim Horton's, McDonald's - which shares the same parking lot, Subway, a no-name pizza place, and so on.\n\nThe entire food court and the area near it have a strong smell of curry.  I like curry, but the smell is too much for me.\n\nThere is enough parking, but be careful if you are driving around here.  The drivers in this area seem crazy.  There are a lot of taxis - they drive by their own rules.
