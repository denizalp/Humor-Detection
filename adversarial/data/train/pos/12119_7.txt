This time I tried the Big Shot Burger.  (see photo)\n\nA 1\/2 burger topped with lettuce, tomato, onions, pickles, mayo, mustard, ketchup, mushrooms, bacon, American cheese and a onion ring. It was freakin' EPIC! For $5.99 it's a hell of a bargain!\n\nI also love the fact that they deliver to my job! FTW!
