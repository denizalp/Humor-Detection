If you ask anyone that grew up in Chandler about Elmer's, they will tell you it's a pillar in the neighborhood. Positioned directly across from Chandler High School, Elmer's has served quite a few generations of students for lunch and their families on the weekends and evenings alike. \n\nGrab yourself one of their famous orders of strips, bean and cheese burrito, or red Chile burro with some of their homemade hot sauce and a large Horchata and you won't be hungry until the next day. \n\nBe sure to bring your patience because you won't be the only one salivating in line to get one of the best burros in town. TBH - sometimes the lady taking your order is crabby, but to be fair, she has been there every time I have ever visited, so maybe I would be crabby too if I was working a million hours like she does.\n\nIf you can look past that, and past the fact that there is no one there to clean the tables between guests, and no napkins on the tables since they are hiding them from the messy students, you will surely be in burro bliss.
