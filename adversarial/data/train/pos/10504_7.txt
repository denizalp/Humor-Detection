Yay KSR is back and honestly did not disappoint. The new location offers more seating and the interior design of high ceiling and e colourful patterned tiled walls adds to the lively, fun ambiance. As per usual, expect to see a crowd congregated near the door waiting for seats as dinner time is always super packed. We got lucky and grabbed a spot at the communal high tables. Music was good, service was quick and the food was consistent with what I expected. We ordered the classics -  Khao Soi and the Bangkok style pad thai paired with of course .... Thai milk tea (my favourite) ! Overall, excited that KSR is back in action and as a side note, there is actually a bar on second level now called Bang Sue which offers cocktails and snacks which I look forward to trying out some time soon!
