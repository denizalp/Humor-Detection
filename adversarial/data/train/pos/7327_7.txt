My husband and I just celebrated a belated Valentines dinner here last week and LOVED it.  It was his first experience and he wants to go back again.\n\nOf course we cannot go every week or every month considering that it costs a pretty penny.\n\nThe service was awesome, the food came out quickly and everything was mouth-watering.  The drinks took a little long but I think it was because he also brought the cheese fondue at the same time, either that or the bartender was slow that night.
