When we booked a rental car a month in advance, they did not ask us how many drivers would be using the car. When we went to pick the car up for a 10-day rental, they said it would be an additional $50 for every additional driver. We ended up putting 2,500 miles onto that car; did they really expect one driver to handle all of that driving? Of course not. They should have included an option to add additional drivers at the time of booking, but instead they surprised us with it after we were already tired  from our flight and in no mood to argue. We have never had any issues with previous rental companies; none of them specified the number of drivers, and all of them allowed unlimited drivers within the booking party at no additional charge. How were we supposed to know there would be an additional charge for each driver? We're not fucking psychic; this is daylight robbery.\n\ninb4filtered, just like every other one-star review of this place.
