Gorgeous views, esp. in the evening as the sun is setting. If you need a breath of fresh air while in Vegas, the drive out from the strip is totally worth it. There are several trails or you can just wander in an out of the canyon like we did. If you're feeling esp. lazy, you can drive through the canyon and occasionally stop at the lookouts. \n\nSometimes we forget the other things Vegas has to offer - this place is a good reminder that Vegas is not all booze and gambling. (not that there's anything wrong with that.)
