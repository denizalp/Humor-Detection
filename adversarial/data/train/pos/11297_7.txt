My daughter enrolled in a 3-week portion of their Summer Intensive Dance program. My 14yr old daughter was so excited on the first day, she was up 90 minutes before her alarm.\n\nAfter the 1st day- she was completely deflated as she was placed in a level that is not challenging her. When she wanted to discuss or find out why she was placed in a class that was not challenging, she was dismissed by the staff.\n\nMy wife called, and left an email with their staff-- neither was returned. As a small business owner- this is unacceptable. \n\nI am a professional climbing coach and know nothing about ballet- but a lot about a structured workout\/technique work with larger groups. \n\nEither she should be challenged by learning new combinations\/techniques, or she should have enough analysis of her dancing that she can work on perfecting her combinations. Otherwise, she is not learning anything new, and IF she has fundamental mistakes, they are only getting reinforced- not corrected.\n\nAlso, in this class, it is a 22-to-1 student to teacher ratio. No wonder there is no critical analysis of their dance-- the teacher has no time for that. This ratio is completely unacceptable for a short term intensive program.\nIF my climbing programs had that same ratio- I would feel like I am robbing those parents of their money. Looks like Ballet Arizona does not think the same way. \n\nI would spend my money elsewhere.\n\nAlso-- we just found out their HVAC broke last night, and there is no dance today. We were told there are no refunds. Isn't that a great policy??
