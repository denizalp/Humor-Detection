If you're in the Tempe area there is Norway you should miss the chance to eat here. The portions were so large I could barely Finnish my meal. I had the chicken schnitzel cordon bleu and my husband had the frikkadeller, and both were delicious. The beet salad sides were perfectly Swedened; just the right balance of savory and sweet. If you like Scandinavian food Denmark this place down on your list of restaurants to visit. \n\nP.S. Iceland? I don't know.
