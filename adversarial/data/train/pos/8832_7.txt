First of all, this place had some massive portions. It had that diner feel spot on, from the colour choices to the extra friendly waitress that calls you honey and asks about your day. The food itself wasn't exceptionally great. I had the chicken and bacon panini, but it seemed more like a regular sandwich. The bread was very chewy and the chicken tastes processed. The home fries that came with my sandwich was very good though. My friend ordered a Shepard's pie that tasted quite nice. Overall, I'd come again because of the great atmosphere and I'll try something else on the menu. I'm still hopeful
