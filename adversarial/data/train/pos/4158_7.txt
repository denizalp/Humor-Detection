Swung into this small little spot as we walked back into our hotel. We were craving something sweet! And thank goodness they were still open. :)\n\nGot ourselves one lemon tart and one apple crumble tart. They were \"Vegas-priced\", but we didn't mind.\n\nBroke into these babies back at our hotel suite. Both were amazeballs! But I liked the fresh tartness of the lemon tart way more than the apple one. \n\nThey serve breakfast and lunch items here and it seemed like some of the folks that were dining there were definitely enjoying their meals.\n\nGreat spot to grab something quick if you're staying at The Signature.
