I get that gambling is something to do in Vegas, but does it have to be everywhere?  I mean even the grocery stores have sectioned spaces specifically for slot machines.\n\nNow, I do like to play a game of chance every once in awhile, but I also need a safe bet.\n\nFry's happens to be one of those safe bets.\n\nThe first thing you see upon entering is this hokey slot machine facade but don't let that deter you.  There are some good buys to be found inside.  And in their defense, at least it makes a little more sense than the cowboy theme at their Palo Alto location.\n\nI usually find a couple DVD's or games for the DS.\nAnd at the very least, I get to practice a little Guitar Hero or whatever game they have on display.\n\nSo for goodness sake, if you've forgotten your phone charger or if you ear buds are busted, please make a trip out here instead of wasting your money elsewhere.\nAnd with the money you save, you'll have a little extra to play with when you go back to the tables.
