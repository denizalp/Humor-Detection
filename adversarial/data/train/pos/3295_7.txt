MAGIC!  But I am getting ahead of myself.  I bookmarked prior to a trip to the \"The Grand Canyon State.\"  It seems like an interesting place to visit if the opportunity presented it's self.  Sure enough it did.  \n\nWe had some time to kill after taking in some Padre BP.  We like butterflies and this seemed like a nice place to kill some time.  Coordinates put into the iPhone and the route was easily negotiated.  \n\nDamn!  The parking lot was not full but it was busy.  The ticket line was full and busy.  I quickly reconsidered the idea of making a visit but the draw of Lepidoptera was too great.  The GF and I settled in and I could not wait to experience and educate myself.\n\nThe beginning of the journey consists of a 3D movie about the multigenerational journey of a Monarch butterfly family.  The theater is large and the 3D is awesome!  I learned a lot and I was happy to hear the Monarch epicenter is now a World Heritage Site.\n\nAfter the movie, you are brought into a briefing area where you are told about the do's and do not's of entering the wonderland.  While waiting to enter you can inform yourself about various stages of butterfly development from Pupa to Adult.\n\nWhen your time arrives to enter, you are instantly transported into the butterfly equivalent of Wonka Land.  There beautiful creatures are flying about in an amazing biosphere.  Humid and warm but not unbearable.  You can loiter about for as long as you like.  Don't touch!  Various breeds will zoom and do all things adult butterfly related as you meander about.  Sure there were lot's of people but everyone seemed seemed respectful.  The overall beauty and tranquility of these beautiful creatures was....dare, I say.......therapeutic. \n\nRemember to WATCH YOUR STEP.  If you want some extra attention...WEAR BRIGHT COLORS!!
