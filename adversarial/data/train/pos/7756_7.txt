We came here on a Monday afternoon to order off their lunch special. We got \n1. Grilled chicken sandwich\n2. Shrimp tacos\n3. Strawberry lemonade\nfor $23\n\n- Lunch Specials: M-F 11-3pm. $7.99. Great deal!\n- Fresh bread\n- After 3pm, they have their 'Take 5' Deal. 5 for $5 from 3-6pm\n- If you come at 230, you can receive the best of both worlds!\n- Great chicken sandwich. Tasty\n- 4-5 pieces of either fried or grilled shrimp. Flavorful. Tortilla and rice were a bit hard. \n- Flavorful drink. No refills.\n- Great service. Bryan was friendly and attentive. \n- Better alternative for an American lunch compared to Red Robin during 11-3. Otherwise, I prefer RR simply bc bottomless fries and flavored drinks.
