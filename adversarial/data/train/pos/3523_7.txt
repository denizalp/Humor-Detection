We just happened to be passing through Fort Mill and the wife and I were starved. We had a series of unfortunate events trying to find a restaurant that was open and to our liking. Clearly someone was looking out for us because we wound up at the right place. Tapas 51 is in the old Passion8 location with a whole new decor. The wife and I split the daily special ceviche of NC bass, shrimp papusa, yucca poutine, daily special snapper tacos, brisket tacos and the \"pot\" brownie for dessert.\n\nEverything was packed with fresh flavors and simply prepared. They used a lot of interesting plating devices like pieces of wood and ceramic tiles. The service was attentive and informative at answering questions. The yucca poutine was very good with all the components prepared and matched well. As a French Canadian, I would like to see them change poutine to \"poutine\" on the menu or maybe call it a South American poutine. Still a great dish, but us French Canadian are protective of our poutine. I just wish Tapas 51 was closer. Maybe a second location in Noda?
