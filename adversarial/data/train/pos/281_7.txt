Ice Pan is located on the second floor of Harrah's, right by the Monorail. \n\nJust in case you don't know what Ice Pan is, Ice Pan makes freshly made ice cream right before your eyes. You get the choice of fruits and milk. Then they blend and spread the mixture on an \"Ice Pan\", where it freezes into ice cream. It's like MAGIC!\n\nThe owner is also extremely warm and friendly, who is very passionate about his creations. The price is a little more on the steeper side for ice cream, but its definitely worth every penny. You have to remember that you're not paying for some generic bucket ice cream at the market. These are freshly made custom ice cream to your liking. \n\nIf you're in Sin City and you need a place to just chill out. Give this Hidden Gem a try, you won't regret it !
