Mutter paneer roti gets my vote for pretty damn good next to Ghandi's but for heaven's sake please make it spicy when I ask for it. \nI constantly ask for hot and get medium, sometimes getting into the \"are you sure you want spicy?\" Conversation with the waiter. \nYes I do want spicy, just because I'm white doesn't mean you have to baby my taste buds. \nI keep coming back, so obviously the food is good.
