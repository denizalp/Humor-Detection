Is it weird that I get a little giddy every time I head to the airport from the anticipation of eating at Currito? Yupp that sounds pretty strange, but hey it's the truth! Currito is seriously the best food place at the airport! I've tried both the teriyaki chicken and chicken masala burritos, and both were BOMB! The service is also really fast. So if you're stuck at the airport for a while and those unexpected munchies come in, stop by Currito and treat your taste buds to something delicious :)
