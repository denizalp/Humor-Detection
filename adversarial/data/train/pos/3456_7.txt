We came here for dinner and the place looked a little empty so we were super excited since we got seated right away by the hostess. No smiles just walked us to the table and gave us the menu.   \n\nWaiter was friendly and took our order quickly.  We ordered the cheese wheel pasta, calm linguine, and 2 kids pasta alfredo with meatballs.  The food was tasty and everything came out quickly.  \n\nKaraoke is fun to listen to and the service was ok.  My only issue is that we had to ask for the bread three times before we got a basket.  By the time it arrived I was already finished with my plate. Big Fail!!!\n\nCome on people; attention to detail, first item should had been the bread.\n\nTiramisu was a little off.  The lady fingers tasted soggy and reminded me of tres leche. I would say come for the karaoke but good luck with the food and service \n\nI don't see myself coming back as there is nothing that jumps out at me for a second visit.
