I have booked with VIP for the past two years for my staff holiday party. We've had a blast riding on their party buses. The owner Andrew was friendly and thorough in his confirmation of the itinerary and items we should bring on the bus. He called the day before to make sure everything was set and that we didn't want any changes to our schedule. \n\nOur driver Justin called ahead of time and was even early to pick us up. He was funny, personable and prompt for pick up and drop off. He was quick to respond when we were ready to leave one bar and head to the next.  Justin also reassured the crew that our items were safe on the bus during our various stops along the way. He even endured the traffic around Public Square so that we could stop to get out and see the Christmas lights. \n\nThe bus was clean, comfortable and the lights on the ceiling were really cool. We could hook up to the Bluetooth and play our own music which was more and more fun as the night went on! \n\nI will continue to come back to VIP for my party bus needs! Thanks for another memorable night.
