My wife and I had been looking forward to a meal at Distrito for some time. When we arrived at 8pm on a Thursday night, we were the ONLY people in the restaurant. That should have been a telling sign that possibly it was time to look elsewhere for dinner.\n\nBefore our appetizers arrived, we enjoyed the cornbread with chipotle honey and citrus butter. This was tremendous, and we had hoped a prelude of the meal to come.\n\nWe started with the fish tacos and octopus appetizers. We're fairly educated foodies from NYC, with a great appreciation for an amazing Phoenix food culture after living here for nearly three years, and have eaten in some of the nicest restaurants in the world. We both agreed the Rubios fish taco is better than that served at Distrito. The fish was alright, but the tortilla was stale and overall, it was dry at best. The octopus was fine, nothing to write home about.\n\nWe shared the Skuna Bay Salmon and the Garlic Prawn entrees. I kid you not that we couldn't finish our salmon entree because it was so sweet. In a pasilla pepper broth, I would have expected some heat... not a piece of candied salmon with raisins. This was very disappointing. The shrimp entree wasn't bad, but we both agreed it tasted no different from the tequila citrus shrimp that we, not formally trained chefs, make at home.\n\nThe entire meal lasted less than an hour. The service reminded me of what you might receive at an Applebee's. We never had even five minutes to enjoy alone before we either brought our next course or approached. I stood up to use the restroom in the middle of the meal and noticed that much of the staff was sitting at the restaurant's bar. Regardless of how empty a restaurant is, and this one was completely empty, I would never allow my staff to sit at the bar. It just looks bad.\n\nAverage food at best + poor service + high prices = most likely not going to return.\n\nWhat a disappointing experience for a meal we were quite looking forward to.
