It's a chain bar inside the Rio. Did anyone really have high expectations? Normally, a McFadden's isn't so bad. But since this one is in the classy establishment known as the Rio, they had to Vegas-ize it and add that special touch of class - half-naked women. And it is with this special touch that this bar plummeted from chill chain Irish pub to frat party central. Count me out.\n\nNow, though, when us politicos take over the entire place, count me in. The ambiance and enviro is completely different. And we keep the karaoke clean.\n\nThis place does have the bonus, though, of offering live band karaoke on certain nights. And this wins them an extra star. Live band is pretty much always going to be more awesome than non-live band.\n\nThe food is bleh. The beer selection is eh. The mixed drinks are ick. The service is meh.
