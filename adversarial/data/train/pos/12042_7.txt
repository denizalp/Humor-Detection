Amazing!  \n\nA wonderful tasting menu of Chef Andrés' avant garde Spanish cuisine.  We were served 20 small bites and 5 wines over approximately 2.5 hours.  My favorites were the Apple \"Brazo de Gitano\", José Taco, Bocata de \"Calamares\" and my slice of the \"Whole Lobe of Foie Gras Baked in Sea Salt\"\n\nIt's not cheap - $250 plus tax\/person - but this price includes food, wine AND gratuity.  They have two seating per night at 5:30 and 8:30, and only 8 diners per seating so the experience\/service is unmatched.  And while I don't make enough money to call anything 250 bucks an absolute steal, compared to many other high-end restaurants in Vegas I wouldn't hesitate to call é a bargain.\n\nIf all you care about is getting as full as possible for as little cash as possible, the Cosmopolitan Hotel has a wonderful buffet one floor down which I'm sure you'll enjoy more.  If you love interesting, innovative, delicious food, and are willing to pay for some superior ingredients and service, é is an experience that shouldn't be missed.\n\nOne more thing... reservations are only available by e-mailing a not-so-secret anymore address - reserve@ebyjoseandres.com
