STATE BOARD OF COSMETOLOGY NEEDS TO VISIT! RED FLAGS! BEWARE!\nThis place has the appearance of a nice clean and well kept salon.  I have been a few times but NEVER AGAIN.\n\nShort Massage: They offer a menu w\/ a break down of what the service includes.  I always felt like the massage was much shorter so on my last visit I decided to time it w\/ the stop watch on my iPhone.  It was half as long as it should have been but they charge you for it.  Make sure you are getting what you are paying for if you go for an upgraded pedicure.\n\nReckless: Very aggressive w\/ the metal cheese grater looking tool they use on everyone's feet.  There is a more gentle way of getting the dead skin off of your feet ladies.  This rough and aggressive approach is very dangerous.  \n\nCuticles: They cut the cuticles way to close to the skin which isn't necessary.  Your cuticles are there for a reason. Trimming the cuticles can break the seal that protects the surrounding skin from infection.  You should just get your cuticles pushed back but not cut off.\n\nSanitation: They bring the tools out in what looks like a \"sterile bag\" that a hospital would keep scalpels in.  They open the bag in front of you which is a false sense on security because my guy placed the instruments back into the bag and pinched the end closed when he was done w\/ my pedicure.  I don't know what he did with the tools after that? Did he bring the same tools out of that bag for the next person without sanitizing them properly? Were they clean when he peeled the bag open for me? The bag looks clean but I am curious if they just slide dirty instruments back into a \"sterile looking\" bag so it looks clean to a new customer?\n\nDirty Bowl: I got a manicure and the lady grabbed a bowl from under the sink and filled it with warm water.  I soaked my fingers in the bowl which had glass stones in the bottom.  She cut my natural nails so SHORT! I wanted to keep the length and just wanted them evened up...to late for that since she clipped the first two so short  without asking how I wanted them.  When she finished the manicure she went to the sink, put her hands on the stones to keep them in the bowl, and then dumped the water down the drain.  Then she put the bowl w\/ stones back under the sink.  I am suspecting they don't sanitize the bowl or stones between manicures and just store it under the sink.  The thought of someone else's cuticles and nail clippings in the stones is disgusting! \n\nThey are very pushy with the upgrades for gel nails, nail art, waxing, deluxe pedicures etc... Beware if you go here.  You may be at risk of an infection.\n\nI will NEVER go here again.
