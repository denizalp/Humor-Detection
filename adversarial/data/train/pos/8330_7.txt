you should only stay here for 3 reasons:\n\n1.) you are a college kid or are on an EXTREMELY tight budget\n2.) you are going with a group of your friends and would rather spend money on booze, strippers, etc. etc. than on your hotel room.\n3.) you are bringing your kids and they INSIST on staying here (you can stay at excaliber for roughly the same price and get better service)\n\nother than that you can find a nicer hotel for a little bit more money. the 3 cheapest hotels i have found on the main strip in vegas are Circus Circus, Stratosphere, and The Sahara. I dont think this hotel has been cleaned since the late 1970's. when you walk into the room there are clowns everywhere and for some people that could be a traumatic experience. The circus act show they have in the main room and the pink dome with the rides is cool i guess, but is that what you really came to vegas for?
