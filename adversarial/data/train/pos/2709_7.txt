Came here to get energized before work on a Sunday! They have a double drive thru and I didn't realize you could drive around and go to the other side so I waited behind a car on the right. Neat concept though, plus you can walk up to the window in the middle and order too. \n\nThe barista was kind and apologized for my wait, as the person ahead of me had ordered multiple drinks. I got the 16oz java chip granita with almond milk, no whip. It was tasty, had the right amount of caffeine and sugar to keep me going. I did need to mix it up since the coffee granules kept sinking to the bottom. Their menu has a wide selection of drinks as well as breakfast burritos and pastries. I like that it's close to ASU but far enough that it's not too busy. I'd come back!
