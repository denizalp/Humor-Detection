A super 24\/7 convenience store inside The Cosmopolitan! Libations, drinks, snacks, sundries, and souvenirs all all there. Yeah, the prices are marked up, but who cares. If you have to keep looking in your wallet while on vacation, you should have stayed home. Purchases count towards The Cosmo's Identity Rewards!
