Is there such a thing as too authentic? Yes. Yes there is. How did this place get 4.5 stars on Yelp?!\n\nMe and my boyfriend went there for nachos, just simple Mexican nachos. We ordered regular chicken nachos and just that simple request was met by a woman who speaks ZERO English... She looked at us like WE didn't know what we were talking about, but in all reality she had no damn clue what we were saying. A young man came out of the kitchen to help (obvious he knew she needed help speaking to us) and he apparently made matters worse because there was a thin layer of chicken on some crappy chips, and there was... No cheese... WHO DOESNT PUT FREAKING CHEESE ON NACHOS?! These guys. That's who. \nThe woman proceeded to ask us if we wanted this and that topping, we got nearly every topping and the nachos were still dry. I don't think I could've been more disappointed. Ps: the horchata was mediocre at best.
