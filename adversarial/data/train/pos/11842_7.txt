If you find yourself in Cleveland and are craving Thai, this hands down the best Southeast Asian food in the city....er possibly the region too.  Definitely divey, but don't be dettered!  This is as good as it's going to get out here.  It is recognized by Cleveland.com and is consistently praised in The Plain Dealer for a reason!\n\nThe menu is extensive and explanatory, but holy mary mother of god, please trust me when I say that ordering spicy is REALLY F-ING SPICY!\nI recall one trip we could barely finish our meals.  \n\nAlso, the folks who own Phnom Penh are probably the nicest people alive and know the meaning of customer service.  Dishes provide heaping portions and are very reasonably priced.
