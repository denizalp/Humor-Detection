We have been here a lot throughout the years, and had literally supported it time and time again.\n\nUnfortunately in our most recent visit (this past July), we were sorely disappointed. A place that we had been raving about  to our friends have now changed. IT HAS DETERIORATED drastically.\n\n1) the hostesses at the front have no idea what customer service is. I'd be happy if they could just stop rolling their eyes and giving their customers attitude. Come on, who's paying for your paycheck?\n\n2) Our waitress (an African American woman) was extremely un attentive. I ordered water, and she \"completely forgot!\" really? Who takes the order and lies blatantly to your face saying \"It'll be out soon, I'm making sure!\" and then.......15 - 20 minutes go by and she walks by you like nothing happened? \n\n3) HORRIBLE food this time. My ceasar salad was DRENCHED in sauce. Like literally. OMG it was just so thick it tasted very unhealthy. My beau's burger was forgettable. \n\nNEEDLESS to say we will NOT be back.
