Since my wife works so close to home, she has been putting in more hours at the office.  Well, there are quite a few fast food restaurants between her office and home, so we've adopted this new dinner plan: get some cheap food on the way home.\n\nInstead of her calling me to ask me what I wanted, I called her!  Yep, the Pavlovian Dog Experiment really works!  I was flipping channels on TV when I saw a Subway commercial for their new spicy hot subs.  I thought, \"I wonder if they're as hot as they say they are.\"  Within 30 minutes of viewing said commercial, I placed the call to wifey to ask her to stop at Subway on her way home.  Damn you, Subway!  \n\nI wanted to try the new Buffalo Chicken sub, so that's exactly what I did.  Got it on wheat with lettuce, tomato and mayo.  It was really good, but I could barely taste any Buffalo sauce at all.  I have some Frank's Red Hot Sauce (the best ever!) and I instantaneously debated adding some, but I was so hungry I just ate the thing.\n\nSo it was a good sammich, but not hot at all.  Subway lies like Taco Bell when they claim to serve spicy hot food.  This 'spicy hot' is for wimps.\n\nI'm out.
