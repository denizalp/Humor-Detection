I used to love Costco for the products that they have at reasonable prices...not always the best prices but reasonable.  My regular trips will end as of today and I am requesting an immediate refund of my remaining membership fees.\nMy reasoning, it's simple.  The leadership of Costco has determined that I should not read a book, period.  It has made me wonder, how many other products, books, videos, has Costco not stocked due to the political beliefs of the leadership?\nGod Bless America for your choice as a company to order all of the books \"America\" pulled off of your store shelves.  God Bless American for giving me the same choice to NOT remain a member and continue to line your pockets so you can donate to the progressive movement which is killing our great country.
