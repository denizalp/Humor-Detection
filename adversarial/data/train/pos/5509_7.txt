I feel like I've grown up with Pucci. Pucci was the first salon I ever visited for a \"grown-up\" haircut and blow dry. This was when I was in junior high. I remember sitting in the chair and feeling so beautiful when I looked in the mirror to see my new do! Since then, I've visited Pucci over the years and my favorite memory as a \"grown-up\" is a year+ ago when they saved the day the week of my wedding. I was convinced to get eyelash extensions for my wedding and honeymoon and was sold on the thought of not needing to wear mascara on my honeymoon. Eyelash extensions last two weeks. My makeup artist did a great job with them, but due to a lack of communication, I realized all too late that my new eyelashes looked more like I was club ready than wedding ready. I looked a little too wild for my liking! I was only three days away from my wedding and had no idea what to do because eyelash extensions are permanent unless you get them removed or they naturally fall out. I decided to turn to an old favorite, Pucci. I walked in and was able to make an appointment with Shauna. I explained the situation to her and she did a great job of keeping me rational and optimistic. We went through the options and although she didn't officially recommend my decision, she agreed to remove the eyelash extensions at the end of my eyes. A couple magical minutes later, I looked in the mirror and poof! I no longer looked like I was about to hit the clubs and instead looked like I had perfect eyelashes ready for my wedding day. She truly saved the day and I will also continue to support Pucci. This is because they offer excellent customer service and they have highly qualified staff who know how to work magic on your appearance. You're going to pay for it, but the money is worth the outcome.
