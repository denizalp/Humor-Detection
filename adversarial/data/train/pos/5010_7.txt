I finally got the chance to try out Bouchon and I was not disappointed at all.\n\n5 Stars for their service\n5 Stars for the food\n5 Stars for the ambiance\n\nAt Bouchon, you're definitely treated like a Duke or Duchess.  Your bread is kept full, your drinks kept filled, and your table kept clean.  I assume that they watch your table like a hawk or have special powers because whenever our waiter was needed, one was at our table without even having to wave one down.  Service is important to me and their timing with everything was impeccable.  \n\nNow for their food....\n\nThe Pastry Basket: You get to select what 4 items you want in your pastry basket.  We chose their pain au chocolat (chocolate filled croissant), a plain croissant, raspberry beignets, and a scone.  Both croissants were flaky, tasty, and had a buttery taste to them.  I thought that the beignet was just okay and their scone was phenomenal.  I could eat 10 of these in one sitting.  Don't dare me, I will.  The scone just breaks and melts in your mouth.  http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/user_local_photos?select=D6VMKEvKSRDmL3Yft3EoPQ&userid=y3FcL4bLy0eLlkb0SDPnBQ)\n\nChicken & Waffles: I just had to give their Chicken and Waffles a try since it was my first time here.  Fellow Yelp Bud, Rodney H, recommended this and I was hit with the some of the best chicken and waffles that I have ever had.  You can't go wrong with this order.  Usually the waffles is the highlight of a chicken\/waffle dish.  Here at Bouchon, they didn't skimp on taste with their chicken, which made it tough for me to decide what was better, the chicken or the waffle.  The chicken was seasoned and prepared just right.  Combine the great tasting chicken with their waffles (crispy on the outside, moist on the inside) and you're left wanting seconds. Take my recommendations...get the Chicken & Waffles.

The restaurant was empty and quiet for a Sunday morning.  Look around and Bouchon's French setting makes you forget you're even in the Venetian.  \n\nPrice:\nThe great service, food, and ambiance doesn't come with a Denny's or IHOP price tag.  The pastry basket, my chicken & waffles, and the gf's dish (Croque Madame) came to about $60 before the tip.  But in my opinion, this is not expensive at all because you get what you pay for.  Heck, it's a lot cheaper than flying out to Paris for this.  \n\nOverall, I had this place bookmarked for some time now. I wasn't disappointed and look forward to trying out their dinner menu. Bouchon, you're a hit and can't wait to come back. \n\nPS:  http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/user_local_photos?select=39qJzeV2PlNqbeERwVL8PA&userid=y3FcL4bLy0eLlkb0SDPnBQ\n\n\nYELP PERSONAL CHALLENGE - (026\/366)
