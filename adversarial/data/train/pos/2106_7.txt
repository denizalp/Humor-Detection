Very convenient location on Mill ave where all the bars are and close to the AMC. They don't validate parking so we had to pay at the meters. Came on a Saturday night and it was SO DEAD! That was a big red flag to me and I realized why later on in the night...\n\nThe inside decor is cute and they were playing movies on the big screen throughout the night. They also have a pretty big bar area. Our party of 6 got a good sized table to fit all of us with enough elbow room and didn't feel cramped.\n\nI went with the chicken pesto pizza, but didn't feel like pesto sauce that night and they were able to let me substitute for marinara sauce. Loved the toppings on this pizza especially the truffle oil! Pizza was a decent size probably about the same size as you would get at build your own pizza places like Pieology or Blaze Pizza. The dough and crust itself though was better than I expected! Perfect texture with the crunch outside, but nice chewy inside. The negative thing about this pizza is that they seemed skimpy with the toppings. Looked like only half of my pizza had chicken.\n\nEveryone else enjoyed their food, but I docked 2 stars because THEY WERE SO SLOW!! Did they only have one chef in the kitchen that night or something!? We literally waited over 45 minutes for our food. The food seemed fresh, but geez I have never waited that long just for pizza. It wasn't even a busy night because it was just our table and 3 other tables occupying the restaurant that night. Overall, food is decently priced for a place in downtown and they have a really good happy hour, but service is slow!
