ouch...i really was excited to try this place...\n\ncame here after a long day excited and hungry. our party of 5 was seated quickly and our server was quick to come take our drink orders but that's pretty much where the service stopped.\n\nwe had a few questions when we were ordering and our server was somewhat impatient with us but that wasn't enough to ruin my experience.\n\nafter taking our order i asked if they had bread or anything before the food came since we were starving and our server replied and said \"we dont have any bread but i can heat up some focaccia for you guys\" i quickly said thanks and a few minutes later he brought out 3 pieces of bread. it was decent, but nothing special..little did we know it would cost us $3 for 3 small pieces of bread... i mean common are you serious?! any normal person would think that the bread was complimentary.. i was shocked to see us charged for the bread and also at the outrageous price of a dollar a piece\n\npizza was not that great, very thin (that's not what I'm complaining about) but flavor was not that great, the pasta tasted like it was frozen even though they said it was made in house but very hard and didn't seem fully cooked.\n\nno refills on water, no checking up on us the whole meal\n\nservice: 0 stars\nfood: 1 star\n\nyea I'm glad I was only here on vacation since there's no way I would be coming back
