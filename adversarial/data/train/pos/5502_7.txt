I've been here before, my deja vu tells me.\n\nThey've renamed the \"top\" venue the Nile Theater. Good luck finding it on Google, in Yelp or any other normal search effort. Had an opportunity to see Black Veil Brides on 01\/05\/13 for $18 and jumped last second. I should have known when I heard it was an all-ages show... \n\nCool:\n-considered by many an \"intimate venue\"... yes, it's smaller than your big-name venues like Cricket or Dodge or whatever they're calling them these days, but only slightly smaller than Marquee.\n-free parking on the street\n-affordable tickets ($18 for all-ages show for a big-name band)\n-dodgy rock'n'roll atmosphere which I like\n\nTotally Not Cool:\nI hate all-ages events. It really has nothing to do with the kids themselves (for the most part) but the restrictions and legislature that comes along with it.\n-NO BAR, DRY VENUE. I cannot stress this enough. When I go to a concert, I like to get a li'l drunk and have a good time. Let's just say I wasn't a happy camper when I realized what I'd gotten myself into.\n-you have to pay $2 for a \"bracelet\" that allows you to go outside and come back in. What is this, a punishment for smokers? My thinking is, why can't we have a bar and give the bracelets to those who are 21+ and allow people to go in and out freely??\n(I'm beginning to sound like an old fart right now)\n-I'm tired of kids with iPhones, and Blackberry phones videotaping and taking pictures of the whole damn show. YOU ARE MISSING THE ACTUAL CONCERT. And I can't see through your arm, hand or cell phone. When you multiply this by 30, it's difficult to see the stage AT ALL. I think that the venue should implement a new policy on this. If staff sees you filming the whole effing set, your phone gets confiscated or you get kicked out. I have an iPhone and GUESS WHAT I didn't take one single picture or video. I enjoy my concerts first-hand.\n-Ma and Pop, please stay at home and let the \"kids\" have a little fun. If you're a Mom or Dad who likes this kind of music, leave the kids at home (there was a little girl no more than 6 at this show). \n-the \"bars\" that are \"nearby\" that are \"recommended\" are jokes. Notice how many quotes I used. They are hotel bars. They aren't bars you'd bring a friend, a date, or yourself to.\n\nI'll keep an eye on the Underground and the Nile Theater for upcoming shows, but I can almost guarantee that the all-ages shows will be on my shit list. I want to love you, Underground\/Nile... but you're like a single mother with 200 screaming kids and you won't let me have a single scotch...
