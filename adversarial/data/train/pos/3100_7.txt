No wonder this place was featured in Harold and Kumar. You would need to be drunk or stoned to enjoy White Castle.\n\nI was so excited to try this because relatives on the east coast love White Castle. Plus Harold and Kumar made this place seem like some sort of burger godsend. \n\nWhat a load of crap. Crappy bread, patties, and fries. At least they did the job and the fries weren't too salty.\n\nBut this is mediocre. In-N-Out is better.
