What a great experience!\n\nThis was my first time at this park. My nephew was in the Special Olympics Softball finals and this was the host field. I must say, I was really impressed!! \n\nWhen I heard it was at a 'community' park I was picturing dead grass and port-a-potties, lol. Instead we pulled into a big parking lot, the grass was green as could be and we didn't have to walk on it because there were nice walking trails. I saw people carrying in with their own chairs, except for me (so unprepared, lol), but it was okay because they had covered bleachers at each of the softball fields. Another great thing? Real bathrooms! No port-a-potty stank here :D\n\nAll in all, a great park! \n\n*(4) Softball Fields \n*Open Green Spaces \n*Walking Paths \n*Restrooms
