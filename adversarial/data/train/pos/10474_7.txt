Uuuuummmmmm YES!! This place was on point I'm a bit bougie when it comes to where I stay and when I tell you they are on point I mean that ish! First of all it was a out on limb random trip...like they kind where someone joking says \"we should just go to Vegas\" then looks at you and you say \"yea we should!\" And look back at them...the rule of thumb is if you maintain eye contact for more then 20 seconds or mention going again within a 48hr period your going! I don't know who made these rules but hey I'm a rule follower!! so of course no one had made any prior arrangements....this eye lock happened on Sunday then on Monday it happeded AGAIN so....it was official we HAD to go! We planned to leave Tuesday so that night my friend got on Groupon and order two nights however when we got there they couldn't find a Groupon confirmation for us...bummer! thankfully the receptionist had no problem matching the price that Groupon gave us (lucky we had screenshots but I think she would have either way she could see the panic in our eyes (or that could have just been the \"we made it to Vegas\" shot we had...yup another rule)) and even upgraded our room it was nice, clean, up to date and had a sweet view! It was Vegas so most EVERYTHING else that happened I'm not at liberty to say...lol but it was a blast!
