This is a gross place for gross people.  It's a cynical cash-in on the current wave of gamer nostalgia.  \nImagine the worst kind of Ed Hardy, velvet rope, bottle service vibe then add a broken Donkey Kong machine and you've got this place.\n\nI played a machine here a year ago and it was broken in the exact same way as when I played it Saturday.  I remember I told one of the folks working there that the stick was messed up.  They could not have cared less.\n\nThere's better Barcades in other cities.  I hope some day Vegas gets one that doesn't feel like it's run by the Kardashians.
