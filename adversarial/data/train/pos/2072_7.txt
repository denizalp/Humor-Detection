Went to hakkasan last night 10\/2\/15. We were able to get on the guest list and got in no problem. But it was horrible inside. The bar was packed. Drink was expensive I only gave it one star because the bartender who made my adios made it very strong and good. The dance floor was pack as hell, the security kept telling people to move and stop blocking certain area.. uhm where do you want people to go ?? Floors are pack. The whole place is pretty much bottle service table but no one was in them. The upstairs was empty but you don't get a view of the bottom since they're all reserve for bottle service. We left after 30 min. It was my first time to hakkasan .. definitely my last time. \n\nHeard that this club was popping .. turns out its a nightmare club to go to on a Thursday night ... I can't imagine how crazy it is on Fridays and Saturdays. I'm beginning to think that all vegas nightclubs are overrated with expensive drinks and pack dance floors.
