Overall, Duck Creek Park is decent. It's located in a neighborhood off of Pebble and isn't hard to find... Not to be confused with Desert Bloom Park though! The two are located just around the corner from each other. My family and I came to Duck Creek Park to celebrate Easter with a bunch of friends last Sunday and enjoyed our time spent here.\n\nThe park is big and there is lots of space. There is also a decent amount of parking, so that shouldn't be a problem. Duck Creek Park has the usual cabana, grass field, picnic tables, and playground. According to previous reviews, there is also a water park area for the kids, but that wasn't operating when I went, or maybe I just missed it. There are also a few tennis courts if you're interested in practicing your best Serena and Venus moves. Other than that, there isn't much to say about this place. I do however appreciate the fact that there are a lot of trash cans throughout the park! Cleaning up is easy when you don't have to bring your trash elsewhere to throw away.
