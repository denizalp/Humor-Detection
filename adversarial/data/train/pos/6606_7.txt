My partner and I went to rent a home through Lili and we were disrespected and looked down on. I have great credit,$25,000 in my account, he makes $80,000 a year but has some credit issues. I explained this up front before I gave them any money and as dumb as she is, she wanted me to write about his credit issues in the \"have you had a felony\" section!!! I actually had to explain to her that bad credit is not a crime!!! We were rejected and sent a curt email informing us of this. The owner rejected us, or so they said. I sent a heartfelt response from the heart, pleading our case as I liked the home and frankly, I'd already paid their damned application fee which was non refundable. I offered them three months up front. Two days later....no response. I've never been treated with such disrespect and when I am ready to buy and that day is. Or far off, I will never go anywhere near Lili or her husband. Please don't delete this as it  is a real review. I have rewritten it and made it as politically correct as I could but still accurate. \nPlease believe everyone, that she is condescending and arrogant. Not worthy of anyone's business. We did go on to move to a more expensive house and had a year there with no hassles and the landlord loved us.
