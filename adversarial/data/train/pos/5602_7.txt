Sadly, I didn't even get to visit this In-N-Out location because it was so busy the night we were there. It was something my mother wanted to try, and decided that's what we were doing for dinner that night. This was the closest location to where we were. \n\nUnfortunately, the parking lot was completely filled, and the drive-thru was overflowing. So there was almost no chance of parking. My mother has a handicap placard and so we were going to park there. If we didn't, we would have to go find parking somewhere else, like a block or two away and then walk back to the restaurant. \n\nWhat gives this place one single star is the fact the handicap parking place was filled... by an employee in uniform hanging out with his friends during his break. Obviously the friend couldn't find parking any better than we could, and just took a spot that wasn't meant for him. My brother, who was driving the car said something to the employee, who was very clearly just standing at the vehicle and talking\/laughing with his friends. The employee basically said, sorry. Sucks to be you. It left a very bad impression. The employee treated it as if to say, look around. Do you really think you matter? This place is full. Who honestly gives a shit that you aren't going to eat here? That was the attitude this employee had, and it was absolute and complete disrespect. So we left. \n\nWould I return? Absolutely not. I don't need to go somewhere that employees disrespect potential customers, as well as people with disabilities and their need to use a clearly marked handicap parking space to bullshit with their friends on a busy night. There's more than one In-N-Out in Vegas. We went to find another one, and I'm glad we did. They didn't treat it like a frat house either. \n\nReview 122 of 2017.
