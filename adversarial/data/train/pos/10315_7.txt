I have been a patient at WLIAZ for over  3 years.  I have watched the business boom and grow.  With this growth comes some issues like being able to schedule an appointment in a reasonable time frame, and appointment wait times are a little long.  That being said.  I love my WLIAZ family.  Dr. Orris is a wonderful surgeon.  Mike Murphy the Registered Dietician is very hands on & always there when you need advice.  I love the follow up care, and I feel like I chose the best bariatric program to fit my lifestyle and needs.  I highly recommend WLIAZ if you are considering Weight Loss Surgery.
