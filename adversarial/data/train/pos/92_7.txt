Awfull service..don't go here...the guy kept my coupon to give me a discount on my smog check, and when the car failed its smog bec I just had the battery jumped , refused to give it back and charged me $10 for failing and no free retest..DO NOT GO HERE unless you want to lose your money and fail your smog.
