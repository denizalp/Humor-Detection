My aunt wanted to come here SO badly on our last trip to Vegas. She loves watching Bobby Flay and eventhough I am not really into his cooking, I wanted to make her happy. The hostesses were very nice because I had to change my reservation time and number of our party about 3 times but they didnt give me a hassle and were most gracious every time. They were the best part of this restaurant. \n\nWe were sat right in front of the main kitchen which was nice to see them grillin and cookin. We were given ONE small basket of breads, muffins and cakes since it was lunch time. For a party of 9, I didnt think it was enough but we just shared. The jalapeno biscuits were the best item in the basket. \nThe food: One common ingredient throughout....SPICE!\nI ordered the pumpkin soup which had great flavor, but was spicy with pepper and cumin. Good, but too much spice for me. \nMost of us ordered the Mesa burger which was, nothing special. It was large but thats it. They serve it with a horseradish mustard which I dont like but pretty much other than that there was a piece of lettuce in it. \nThe fries that come with it were completely overly spiced up. I couldnt even see the fries! Gross man, it was like eating a jar of mixed spice. Yuck. Two others got the Salmon and it was just okay. \n\nThen the biggest flop by Bobby Flay ever. The pineapple upside down cake was so gross I had to force myself to swallow it. Im so sorry but pepper does not belong in this dessert. This guys spices everything but not in a good way. We also ordered the chocolate cake dessert and it was not that great. \n\nI wouldnt recommend this restaurant with all the other choices in Vegas.
