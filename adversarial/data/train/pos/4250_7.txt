I'm disappointed that a company with such good reviews can be such a mess.\n \nI was referred to Infinity Heating & Cooling by a work friend who was extremely happy with their service. I checked out Infinity's website and saw that I could send them a request for service\/estimate. I sent them a message explaining I was interesting in having my 3 year old air-conditioner serviced. A few hours after I sent them the message, I decided to call because I wanted to follow up and get it scheduled. I called during business hours but no one answered.  I left a message letting them know I contacted them on their website and was waiting to hear back. They never returned my call. \n\nI understand things can get busy around an office and numbers can get misplaced, so I gave them the benefit of the doubt, especially with the great reviews, and I called again.\n\nI called on June 11th and spoke to a lady to set up a time for what she called a \"21 point inspection.\" The time was set for Friday the 17th between 12:00 and 2:00.  Friday came and I left work early to make sure I was home by 12:00. I waited around until after 1:00 when I decided to call and make sure someone was on their way. I spoke with the same lady I set up the original appointment with and she said that my appointment had been rescheduled to June 24th!  I had never received a call or notification of this rescheduling. At this point, she offered to send someone out between 2:00 and 4:00.  Having already wasted over an hour of time that I needed to be accomplishing other things, there was no way I was going to sacrifice another 2+ hours.\n\nThey have lost my business and if somebody asks me for a referral, I will definitely warn them not to waste their time with Infinity Heating & Cooling.
