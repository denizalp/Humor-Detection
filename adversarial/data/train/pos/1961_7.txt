MAJOR FAIL!!!  Please instruct your outbound sales call personnel how to properly handle sales calls. I am always exceptionally polite to sales people, even when we are so busy at work that I really don't have time to deal with them.  I received a call from Aqua Perfect asking to speak to whoever handles our water and coffee service.  When I told the salesperson that we use another company and that we are very happy and not planning on changing companies, but thank you anyway, she slammed the phone down on me mid-sentence.  \n\nNot the way to handle rejection!  If your people are so nasty when they're trying to sell your product, how can they be expected to offer good service once the customer is under contract?\n\nAccepting a \"no\" politely and professionally means there is a chance that a company may contract your services in the future if the need arises.  Being excessively angry, rude, and unprofessional means that said company will remember your company in only a negative way and will most likely post a less-than-flattering review on websites such as Yelp, Yahoo, Google, etc.
