Donuts are the source of more smiles than both rainbows and unicorns.  Combined.  I read that somewhere on the ol' interweb... and dangit, I believe it.  Especially if those donuts are from Rainbow.\n\nMaple bacon, whipped cream filled, toasted coconut, chocolate cake with coconut shavings.  Those are just a few of the magical flavors that the wizards at Rainbow have concocted with their wizardry.    \n\nEveryone, put your hands up in the air and say it with me now... RAINBOW DONUTS, WOO HOO!
