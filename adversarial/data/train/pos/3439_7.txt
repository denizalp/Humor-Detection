Margaret's Fine Imports is a lovely little shop in the heart of downtown Squirrel Hill with a fantastic selection of tea, coffee and other yummy goodies... both imported and American.  I shop here to get gifts for a few people who seem to have everything they could ever want or otherwise not really need anything: my mom, my mother-in-law, my aunt!   All of my gifts from this store have been a success with my giftees.  What else... there is a sale\/clearance section at the back with discounted items and they periodically have sales (in the summer there was a 20% off everything overstock sale, for instance).  I know now (a little by trial and error) that I'm not really a tea or coffee person, but I occasionally stop in to get some candy or cookies for myself.  There is also a good selection of nice aprons... one of these days I'll get one.  Great stuff!  Oh and if you buy a lot of coffee, ask for their coffee card.  You get a stamp for every 1\/2 pound you buy and after 9 lbs. (or 10... I forget), you get one free!
