I use to go here once or twice a week when it was a hole-in-wall pizza joint and the owner worked there everyday.  Really good pie and service. It had a perfect pizza joint atmosphere too. \n\nThen they got really popular, expanded, hired more help, churched the the place up and raised the prices. \n\nI stopped going when I had two back to back experiences with bad food and bad service. The last time I went there was for a large pie and my bill was $40. \n\nNow?  Costco's pizza is better and a whole lot less expensive.
