\"When you learn to accept instead of expect, you'll have fewer disappointments.\" \n\nI was excited to check out Ohlala French Bistro. I'm a fan of Big Horn Olive Oil Company, where on a recent visit I saw and heard good things from another patron about Ohlala. Ohlala French Bistro is a local neighborhood kind-of-spot...one where the owner and servers care about the guests that come in and desire to connect to the clientele. We enjoyed our interaction with the owner very much and the food was a perfect 3 out of 5 stars, precisely A-OK.\n\nWe took the opportunity to try their Warm Crusted Pistachio Goat Cheese, Moules Mariniere, Large Beef Tartare, and Carmel Flan. \n\nThe standout item for us was the Warm Crusted Pistachio Goat Cheese. This baked cheese dish is warming to the body and taste buds. The honey and onion confit jam caramelize nicely and add a sweetness with balanced savory aspects that work well with the goat cheese. The Moules Mariniere was the healthiest 1 lb. portion I have seen in a long while. The broth was not as robust as others I am accustomed to. In fact it required that you used the salted French Fries that come with the dish to maintain an adequate level of flavor. This could have been the Chef's intention, but adding salt at the end in this way limits the potential and flexibility of the dish. The large portion of the Beef Tartare was in fact large. It is done in what I understand to be a French style where the meat is ground as opposed to the chopped filet versions we more commonly see in the US. This style will probably through some patrons for a loop, while others will be fine with it. The flavors were good with capers, mustard, shallot, and pickles coming through nicely. Finally, we shared a Carmel Flan...free with a Yelp Check-in and the purchase of an entr√©e.
