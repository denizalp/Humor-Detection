Alright so I bought a milkshake, A double cheese-burger and some chicken fingers.\n\nThey forgot my ranch, which is ok because my fatass doesn't need it.\n\nI'd give it a 3.5 out of 5, or a 7 out of 10, or a 49 out of 70 or a 77 out of 110. I'd recommend it if you live on the East Side\/Sunrise of Vegas.\n\nIt was good, but it was alright ya know. It's like watching a good movie on Netflix on a really boring night. It's like the 2nd Fast and the Furious movie. You're like, \"I think I've seen this before.\" But can't really point it out.\n\nNot better than Passion of the Christ. Definitely not better than the Lethal Weapon 4.
