I came with some friends on a weekend for dinner, and even at around 5 PM, the place was already starting to fill up.  Thankfully, we got a table for the 8 of us.  \n\nI ordered the burnt tips, since the description on the menu sounded so promising.  I ordered it with bacon wrapped jalepenos and baked beans as sides.  I got the large portion, but was a little disappointed at how small of an amount of meat it seemed to be.  But even placing that issue aside, the quality of the meat was disappointing.  I mean, burnt tips are my favorite part of brisket - I love the smokiness and depth of flavor the burnt-ness adds to the meat.  Therefore, I thought a whole plate of it would be heaven for me.  Maybe it's the fact that too much of a good thing can be a bad thing - Joey needs Monica just like awesome burnt tips need regular brisket.  They balance each other out.  Or maybe it's that my tips were chewy, dry, and at times hard to eat.  Regardless, I wasn't a fan of burnt tips on their own, and I wouldn't recommend getting it.  Joey just couldn't sustain his own show, right?  Oh, and there were only 3 bacon wrapped jalepenos (which tasted good) and the baked beans were just ok. \n\nMy wife got the pulled pork barbecue with a side of smoked veggies.  The barbecue was dry and so-so in flavoring.  It definitely needed the sauce to make it taste better.  And the veggies were not bad.\n\nOur service was pretty friendly and fast, and they did a good job accommodating our table of 6 adults and 2 children.  I was just a bit underwhelmed by the food that we got.  It seemed like the friends we ate with enjoyed their ribs, though.  So maybe next time, that's what I'll try.
