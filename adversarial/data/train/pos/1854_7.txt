Beer Park = a lovely restaurant bar in the heart of the strip!\n\nBeer Park is perfectly situated in front of *Paris* on the second floor with wide views of Las Vegas BLVD from the spectacular Bellagio water fountains across the street to the Eiffel Tower up above.. what a perfect venue to drop by during the day or especially at night. Inside the ambiance and vibes are nice with a rooftop feel and lots of great beers on draft. They also have water misters to beat the heat outside and the DJ was spinning great hip hop and throwbacks around 8pm the Wednesday night I came by. Sweet! \n\nNichollete was our server the night I came here and she gave the best service. She was on top of everything and gave a great impression for my first time here. They also have a full bar in addition to the beer selection along with food, beer flights (Any 4 6oz from draft beer menu for $14), beer cocktails, and other specialty cocktails. I enjoyed the beer and cocktails, but the waffle fries meat and cheese which was yummy (however I would recommend skipping the egg which we added for an extra 2 bucks). I also liked the large connect four they had which  we also played with that night. This place can get pricey as my group got carried away, but when in Vegas might as well enjoy with food, shots, drinks, and beer! \n\nOverall, I highly recommend for the special ambiance, lots of great beer variety on tap, and last but not least food for the hungry.~
