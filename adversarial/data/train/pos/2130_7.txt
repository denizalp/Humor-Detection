so yes, i'm a sucker for discount hair cuts, despite my previous bad luck. i did have a great haircut that cost 30 bucks, but at the rate i'm losing it, i'm willing to forego the price for a quick in\/out discount cut. \n\ntoday i opted for great clips, just a few blocks from the house. you can schedule online, which alot of folks did, but luckily, there were many stylists working today, so i had to wait maybe 5 minutes. \n\nthe cut came out exactly like i asked for...and she even blended my pesky cowlick on the crown of my head, something many, many, many stylists neglect to do. \n\nbut what i really appreciated was my stylists comments about my thinning hair. she didn't ask, she just said i should look into some products to help alleviate my impending baldness. it's not chrome dome yet, but it's slowly running away from my forehead. i do appreciate when someone else can let me know when i can benefit from some extra help. so i start today with \"hair retention\" product. we'll see.....\n\noverall, a nice, quick cut. i hope it's consistent...then it'll be 5 stars!
