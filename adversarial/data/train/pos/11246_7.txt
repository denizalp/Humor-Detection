I am torn on this review, on the on hand its a great local business with good food that has been around for ever. \n\nOn the other hand, they are real assholes to cyclists. I have gone in a number of times when they were not busy, and brought my bike in the store or leaned it up outside, and they were very very rude to me, and told me to get a car. \n\nSo 5 for food, 1 for service.
