My family and I just saw Dr. Kwok at her new office. She was professional and friendly, made time to answer all our questions, and was wonderful with my 2 and 4 year olds, who are generally scared of all doctors. Dr. Kwok had such a great way with kids, I know that her future vision therapy office will be a great success. Dr. Kwok was gentle, versatile, and quick-thinking. She made my girls feel so at ease that they completed their exams, albeit nonverbally, and can't wait to return!\n\nDr. Kwok was a great listener, and I learned more about my eyes than I ever did before at any optometrist's office. I was never rushed and never pressured to purchase anything I didn't need.  My husband needed a new pair of glasses and ended up choosing some sunglasses too. Dr. Kwok had a huge selection of frames and sunglasses, including the cutest ones for kids, at reasonable prices. Comparable to Target but much MUCH better customer service. They helped my husband find the perfect fit for his large head. \n\nIf you want an optometrist who is knowledgeable, personable, and great with all ages, she's your doctor.
