A chef friend recommended this place and I'm so glad he did. I've been to France and never found croissants as delicious as this place. \n\nI ordered the almond, pistachio, chocolate, plain and chocolate ganache. Yes, I tried them all and yes, they were all delicious. I could taste each and every ingredient. Croissants come sliced with a filling\/paste gently spread between the flaky, buttery croissant.\n\nThey're very busy, so don't forget to take a number when you enter. Use the time to take in the days offerings. They also make fresh baked breads, sandwiches, cakes, pies and coffees. \n\nIf you'd like to stay, they have a wonderfully designed space up the stairs, behind the cashier and above the in-house bakery where, if you're lucky, you can watch the artisans at work.
