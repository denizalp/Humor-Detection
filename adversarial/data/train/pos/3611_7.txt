The only reason we came to these shops twice during our Vegas trip was because there's an Apple store in this upscale mall.  Right across from the St. John's store.  Jr. Yelpers made us come twice so they could play with the computers.  This is one of the prettiest malls I've ever seen, everything is decorated with marble and gold colored banisters. \n\nHubby and I explored the rest of the mall and found out where the rich and famous spend their $$ - at this mall!  I've never seen so many high end stores all in one place:  Elie Tahari, Escada, Nanette Lepore, Tadashi, Tory Burch, Burberry, Calvin Klein, Carolina Herrera, Dolce & Gabbana, Emporio Armani, Louis Vuitton, Valentno, Versace, Christian Dior, Christian Lacroix, Emilio Pucci, Marc jacobs, Michael Kors, Fendi, Gucci, Judith Leiber, Longchamp, Balenciaga.  \n\nShoe freak?  Well, spend your heart out for Bally, Donald Pliner, Jimmy Choo,  Stuart Weitzman, Tod's, Giuseppe Zanotti and Salvatore Ferragamo to name a few.  Pretty intimidating to walk into these stores which look empty most of the time with either the salesperson sitting there alone or standing by the doors looking at the tourists. \n\nBauble freak with deep pockets?  There's enough bling at Baccarat, Bvlgari, Cartier, Chopard, David Yurman, De Beers, FRED Paris, Georg Jensen, Harry Winston, Judith Riopka, and Tiffany & Co (one of 3 Tiff stores on the Strip) to keep you starry eyed.\n\nSurprisingly, most of the dining facilities are not as outrageous - like Spago, Max Brenner Restaurant, The Cheesecake Factory, etc.  \nOnly wished I ran into a celeb or two to get an autograph.
