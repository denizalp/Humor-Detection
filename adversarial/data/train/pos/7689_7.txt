Unfortunately, my experience with them wasn't so great.  As we were browsing their lot, a senior-aged salesman trying to make conversation told me that the crowd at Lee Lee Market should be clearing out in about 30 minutes (I'm asian).  Ummmm....I left and bought a car at Big Two Toyota. The owner's wife did call me and left a really nice voicemail apologizing for the salesman's comment.  I don't think they are bad people.  I just think their staff needs to have a little more training in the PC department.
