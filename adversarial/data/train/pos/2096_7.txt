Build your own poke bowl places are popping up all over the Las Vegas valley. Soulfish Poke was one of the first that I tried. After multiple visits to Soulfish Poke, I just find it ok, I'm not head over heels in love. \n\nMy biggest issue is the protein itself is bland! All of the ingredients are thrown in a bowl and sauce is added, but the protein doesn't get to marinate when bowls are built in this manner. The ingredients  have always tasted fresh, but the overall flavor of the bowls have always been lacking. \n\nI also find Soulfish Poke to be overpriced when compared to other poke bowl spots. A small build your own bowl only contains 4 ounces of protein but is $10, and if you want avocado or seaweed salad, that'll cost an extra buck a piece. \n\nAnd finally, service could be better. On my first visit, the employee working was very friendly and helpful but on subsequent visits the service has declined. I even walked out once due to a total lack of service (employees were too busy chatting to realize someone had walked in).\n\nThere are too many spots in town where I get can my poke on these days, so while Soulfish Poke is ok, I don't see myself returning often.
