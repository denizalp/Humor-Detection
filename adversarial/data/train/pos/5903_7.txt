Definitely a hidden gem on the near East Side.  My new quest is for boba tea drinks here in town and Jade Mountain is my new fave spot. \n\nThey have a nice selection of teas and fruit flavors. All can be made hot or cold and with the tapioca balls which always seem freshly made. Yum.  We've had the taro, matcha, coconut, and mango teas, all with tapioca balls. The tea and fruits definitely tasted great and freshly brewed. \n\nThey also have some bakery and a small food menu, potstickers and ramen included.  For a tea\/coffee spot, their ramen and potstickers were pretty darn good (and modestly priced, too). I have been to a number of other ramen spots in town.  Too trendy for my tastes. Jade Mountain's is as good but with a more casual, welcoming and neighborhood vibe.  No pretense. Just is what it is.  Love it. \n\nThe guys in the shop are way cool and welcoming. Not aloof hipsters. Thoughtful and good-natured is how they seem to me and how they help their customers have a refreshing break from their day. \n\nThey have nice casual seating with outlets and power strips for the electronical.  Outdoor seating, too and plenty of curb parking on their side of a shade-lined street. \n\nSo go there. Be mellow. Sip. Breathe. Enjoy.  See you there.
