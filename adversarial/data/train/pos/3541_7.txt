My favorite is the slow conveyor ride as you go through the main tank with all the sharks, hammerheads, turtles, stingrays and hundreds of over fishes.\n\nI also like that they have free wi-fi. So if you're out of towner like myself, who is too cheap to turn on their roaming plan, you can go online while you are here.\n\nThey have random discounts and it's even cheaper when you go at night.\n\nLike all other aquariums, it's family friendly, so there's pretty much kids everywhere. And it does get crowded depending on what you are looking at.
