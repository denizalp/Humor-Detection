Nope!\n\nCons;\n\nUndercooked falafel balls...no crunch.\nSomething was super salty.\n.50 extra for tabbouleh...really?  It's standard at many places.\nWilted lettuce and the other ingredients looked a bit anemic.\nWaxed paper melted into pita due to grilling.\n\nPros;\n\nProvided seating and calories.
