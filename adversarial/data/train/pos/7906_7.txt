Worst tire shop I've ever been to. The tire guy and front counter lady were very rude. Very unorganized, no appointments, and long wait times. They should hire more people for the busy season. The workers there are disgusting,  they were smoking and spitting on the floor, very unprofessional. Waiting room was dusty, washroom was dirty, they don't have liquid soap, the bar soap is disgusting. Prices are also a bit higher compared to other small tire shops. If you care about your car I would not go there, the install was not clean, there were white stuff all over the tires and rims, how sloppy can you get? Never happened anywhere else I went to. I would rate it a 0 star if I could. Would not recommend
