Picnic tables and wooden spool chairs, check. \nString of festive bistro lights, check.\nDecorative picket fence, check.\nGingham tray liner paper, check.\nBroken BBQ hopes and dreams -- check, unfortunately.\n\nThe good: Ambiance gets a solid A. No doubt about it. This restaurant has definitely put in werk-werk-werk-werk-werk and thoughtfully executed its backyard Texas picnic concept. You can't even tell it was an old Jason's Deli. Furthermore, there's ample space and seating -- I almost expected a square dance to happen in the middle of the dining area since it was so spacious. Do-si-do, here goes the bad:\n\nFood is mediocre. I was waiting for the wow factor, but sadly, it never came. I got the #5 Po Boy with pulled pork, which comes with 2 sides. (I chose fried okra and mac+cheese, which I had to wait for. It's okay since I knew it would come out fresh.) My boyfriend got the #7 Sliders, which comes with 3, so you can choose 3 different meats. He chose the creamed corn and cornbread (which you have to pay an add'l $1.50 for). We didn't know why because the single cornbread was so tiny and dry. Actually, all the meats were pretty dry. Even when I added the sauce. The sides were the tastiest part of my meal -- Fried okra w\/ ranch is good, creamed corn surprisingly good. So there's that. Sides are still contenders in the bbq battle.\n\nI'd pick the chains at this point (Famous Dave's, Lucille's, etc) and that's not to say I haven't tried downright authentic Texan BBQ. I have! (Salt Lick and Stubb's FTW -- meaning \"for the win\" just to clarify, not Ft. Worth lol) I'm not a barbecue snob at all, but I'd have to agree with the other reviewers that roasted this place. We've had better.
