Im so glad I found this place! (actually, Im so glad my co-worker read about it and decided to go find it with me-lol) I had always wanted to attempt making curry and other indian dishes but I didnt find the ingredients or didnt fully understand the details in the instructions. We both took our cookbooks... and off we go... we were going to see the wizard!!! \nJackpot!!!! We found every item and the young lady that was stocking the shelves explained the curry mixes and shared tips and tricks.\nI found a few items that I had been ordering on ebay for much less $.\nWhat a fun experiance!
