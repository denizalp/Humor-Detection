A lot of hibachi places you go to nowadays seems like the chefs are just going through the motions. But not here, oh no sir! \n\nFirst off, the ambiance is very classy, and the hibachi tables are larger, and more comfortable to sit at than others. \n\nSecond: while you place the order, the chefs must be in the back room doing like a pound of blow before coming out and cooking. They are nuts! Spining things, throwing things, slicing, dicing, flipping food into your mouth and setting everything on fire. They are great at their showmanship! \n\nThird: They have squirt bottles of sake that they shoot into your mouth for as long as you can take it! AWESOME! \n\nThe food itself was excellent, but as said in previous reviews, don't plan on doing anything afterwards, you'll be so full that you are down for the count.
