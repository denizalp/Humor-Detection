Didnt love this place. The \"design\" i got looked like I was a 65 year old woman heading of to vegas with my sequence cardigan... If i could pull that look off i wouldnt mind it butttttttt i cant. Also they convinced me to wax my eyebrows and ended up waxing my WHOLE FACE. which was completely unneccessary and weird. I am by no means a bearded lady so doing all that just made me break out like crazy. If you just going for a basic one color mani or pedi im sure its fine just be careful with the waxing and designs...
