Another hotel that is connected to the Underground. It's right on top of a Via Rail stop if you want to take a train to Toronto. The Metro is a block away underground.\n\nWent here for a romantic birthday stay a couple of years ago. Everything is very romantic here. I have some very amusing memories of my girlfriend encountering her first bidet. She cranked it up full blast and ran screaming from the bathroom when the little fountain meant for delicate bits reached the ceiling.
