I love Lexus of Las Vegas they have amazing customer service and the staff here is super nice and helpful. \n\nThis review is both for the dealership and the service department. My wife and I both bought our cars here from sale man Chris Daw and he was great both experience was pleasant and we love our cars. \n\nThe service department gives you your first 2 service free and of coarse they offer loaner cars if you make an appointment in enough time. \n\nEvery time you take your car in for service you get a car wash and pastries and refreshment is always available for while you wait in a lovely waiting room. There is also a separate waiting room for kids as well with a tv, books and little wooden toy cars for their enjoyment. \n\nHere's a tip I think the Henderson location offers car wash anytime but the Sahara location is an Eco friendly designed building so they do not offer car washes at anytime just when you get a service done. \n\nAny how if you ever decide to buy a Lexus I think you would be pretty pleased with how they treat you here I am.
