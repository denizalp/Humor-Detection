Tried the one in Cerritos, CA and loved it. So glad there's one here now. I love kbbq and this place doesn't disappoint. Tommy and Yuhao were our servers and they were attentive and gave us some great suggestions. We kept eating and food kept coming. My favorite were the marinated pork belly. Although, anything beef was also delicious. One of the rare places that serve premium beef for kbbq. We will definitely be back. Only thing was missing was dessert. But they just opened so hopefully next time we come we'll get some.
