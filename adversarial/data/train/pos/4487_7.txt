I went there to get my phone screen replaced, at first they said it would be $80 to fix it. So then i ordered my screen from online so it would be cheaper for them to fix it. I went again and told them i ordered the screen and told me it would be $50, so i then went today with my phone to get fixed but they told me it would be $80 even i have the part to fix it. they are rude and greedy. \nI HIGHLY RECOMEND THAT YOU DO NOT VISIT THIS PLACE
