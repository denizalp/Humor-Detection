Fun and causal place for dinner or lunch. A lot of people seem to come here for take outs, maybe because the place itself is not that big and there's a lot of houses in the area. This place is also always full so prepare to wait or just call in to get take out.\n\nPortions are not huge, but a 'good enough' size (maybe because I'm a big eater...). Reminds me of street food in Taiwan, but that is what they're going for anyway so sizes will more or less resemble that. As a rice fan, I thought their Taiwanese Sausage and Minced Pork Rice was sooo good... period.\n\nBe sure to try their drinks before you leave; it's in a take out cup anyway. Personal fave is the pudding milk tea - not overly sweet like a lot of bubble tea chains but still creamy, and you can taste the 'tea' in it. Also has huge chunks of yellow pudding in it, yum. Another must try is their popcorn chicken that pretty much everyone is raving about. It's bite sized, nicely seasoned and crispy on the outside, while the inside is tender and still nice and hot when they serve it.\n\nI also found their tea to be very flavourful. Not the tea you'd order from their menu, but just the tea they give out. One of the staff mentioned they use 'special' tea leaves or whatever, which I'm not complaining about because they were pretty good, almost like jasmine and very fragrant. \n\nThey've done menu revamps after the owner went somewhere to bring back new dishes so prepare to see some new additions if you haven't been already. The only thing that wasn't balanced imo here were the portion sizes and prices. It's not expensive to say the least, affordable actually, but for the portions they give it's not as well balanced. For the times I've been here I can never be completely 'full' unless I order a huge amount of food on the table, which isn't that big to begin with since the place is small.\n\nAll in all though, definitely a fan of Pa Pa Chang's.
