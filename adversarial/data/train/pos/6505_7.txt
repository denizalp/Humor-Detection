I've been here twice, once a few years ago and again recently with the boy and one of his friends. \n\nI like that the interior is dark and there are music videos playing on various screens along the walls with interesting light fixtures. This is important because a lot of the girls don't look that interested, interesting, or happy, so it's a nice diversion. The first time I came, we had a hookah in the back and enjoyed it. One girl in particular looked especially mopey and danced solely to depressing emo songs. The rest are hit or miss depending on your preferences. I'm sure the cream of the crop aren't particularly drawn to working this location due to it's being far off-the-beaten path.\n\n+ For getting hookah while you get a lapdance. \n+ For the attached store.
