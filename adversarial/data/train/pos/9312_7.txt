Sage is the best dining experience I've had in Vegas.  When my group went, we chose the chefs menu.  It was expensive, but definitely worth every penny.  Every dish we had was not only delicious, but aesthetically pleasing.  \n\nMake sure you have the night schedule cleared of because dinner will take a few hours, but in a great way.
