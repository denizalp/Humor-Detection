This Lee's is like a mini market with packaged snacks, baked goods, refrigerated desserts, and bottled Thai iced tea and Vietnamese coffee. We picked up some sandwiches for the road before leaving Vegas. The sandwich held up well even after a few hours on the road. I really like the bread they use for their banh mi sandwiches, and I was impressed with their croissants as well. A welcome addition to Vegas dining options, especially since it's open 24 hours!
