This place has a great view, but the service is horrendous!!! The redhead bartender on a Saturday literally said \"why are you looking at me\".  Ummmmm because you're the frickin bartender and I need a drink!!!!! She is bitter and needs some customer service training!!! She didn't even give me the right drink! She's awful! Don't get into the service industry if you're angry at life.  Wouldn't recommend this place.  Gave one star because I have to rate.  I give her a -5.
