I've been attending this gym since March, and I'm very pleased! I've actually never been as satisfied with a gym. It's very clean. There's a wide range of machines, & lots of Free Weights. I've never played racket ball or used the pool, but through the window everything looks nice. The locker room & Sauna are very nice. I don't have kids, so I'm not too sure about the childcare. One thing I really appreciate is how pleasant the staff is! Especially since they got rid of that douchebag with the tribal tattoo's. All of the new managers seem pretty cool. They've been making lots of improvements to the facility which is nice since they have a \"$40 facility improvement fee\" every year. So, yeah, it's cool to see them actually put money back into the gym. All in all, a great gym for a great price!
