Pros: Hotel-like rooms and environment, friendly staff, easy access to public bus line. Cons: They aren't overtaking the room or the complex, but there is a roach problem. Prepare for a little battle and you'll be fine.\n\nPeople stay in rooms on the Strip that can start at $80-$100 a night, and there are tiny predators visiting the room. So the creepy visitors aren't enough to warrant a super low rating. I'll edit my review if they declare open war, but for now this works.
