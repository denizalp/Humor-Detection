Sitting below an illuminated ceiling of blue skies and puffy clouds, Le Cafe was built to feel like the outdoor cafes of Paris. On the outside it looks and might even feel like a place to sit and chat while sipping a cappuccino, but being that it's open 24 hours and just heels away from the noisy casino floor of Paris Las Vegas, it's really just a diner.\n\nEvery casino has a diner and due to the nature of Vegas, they're typically the most popular places to eat at all hours of the day. Le Cafe is somewhere in the middle of the diner spectrum, neither exceptional nor completely downtrodden, offering a typical menu of American food and faux-French food.\n\nSomething I always found decent was their breakfast food. Sausage links, tasty omelettes, and hash browns was a meal they could whip up quickly and rather decently. Some of their sandwiches (namely the French dip) were passable for a solid lunch time option and some of the usual baked pastries that were done daily.\n\nHaving sampled lots of baguette combos, crepes, French onion soup, I just avoid the French items on their menu completely. Most all I've had were mediocre, uninspiring, and overpriced. This is no surprise for any casino cafe \/ diner establishment, but it's like going to a Japanese place only to find out the burger tastes better than soba \/ udon \/ ramen. As a result, some of my colleagues during my time here would commonly refer to this place as, \"Le Crap.\"\n\nBut I am not much of a hater. Paris already is plagued with subpar eateries and most of them are closed before 11pm, which leaves the late night goers few options to enjoy. The key to these types of places is embracing what they do best, which for me was almost always breakfast. Service was for the most part pleasant always and the prices were casino worthy, but thankfully this kind of food is the easiest to comp with player points.
