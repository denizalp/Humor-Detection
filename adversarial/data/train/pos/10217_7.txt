Worst flying experience of my life. I was flying San Jose to Phoenix, Phoenix to Charlotte. First flight was a half hour late, giving me ten minutes to make my connecting fight, and the flight attendants could not tell us the status of that flight. They were nice enough to let those with connecting flights off the plane before everyone else. I ended up running across the entire Phoenix airport to make it to my connecting flight, to find out that it had been delayed and hour and a half. Then the flight was delayed an additional four hours, and they made 30 people voluntarily exit the plane before it could take off.
