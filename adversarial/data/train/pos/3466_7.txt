Sandstone Quarry is the 3rd stop from the Red Rock entrance station.  Sandstone Quarry isn't much of a hike.  It's basically flat and rocky.  This small hike will lead you to other hikes, which include Turtlehead Peak, Calico Tanks, and the 11 mile Grand Circle Trails.  There's plenty parking at the start of this hike, but can get full by 9 AM.  Any skill level can enjoy this short hike\/walk from the parking lot.  \n\n2017 Hike Review #4 \/ 2017 Yelp Review #40
