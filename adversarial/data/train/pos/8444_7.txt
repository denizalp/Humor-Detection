I was bummed when Meat and Fish Co. left 7th Street Public market and was pleased to see the signs showing that a different butcher was coming in.  While they don't do seafood which I miss, the variety and quality of meats sold is good so, 4-5 stars in terms of product.\n\nI do have a beef..... hahahaha, get it....? Beef!  OK, I know that was lame but still.... \n\nMy beef seems to be shared by some other reviewers and it's around the service side of the business.  Surly is the best word I can come up with and that's what I got when I tried to pay the dude a compliment related to the quality of the meat I had purchased a couple weeks before.  Heaven help me if had come with a complaint.  Maybe it's a hungover morning, not hungover morning kind of deal that drives what you get.  Who knows.\n\nAll said though, if I'm visiting the market for some Pure Pizza or BAR Chocolate and want some protein to cook up for din din, I won't hesitate to buy from here again.
