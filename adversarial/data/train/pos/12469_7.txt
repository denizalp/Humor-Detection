Showed up at dinner time and had a short wait. We were seated in the only carpeted area of the dining room, which I am assuming is used for private parties. The noise level difference (lesser) from the rest of the dining room is large. \n\nStarted with the loaded skins ($8). While they were good, I would have been happier to have less of them as opposed to having them stacked upon each other. The ones on the bottom were not cooked as well at the ones on the top. Also \"loaded\" is a loose term. The top ones were the only ones that were. Ones on the bottom had some cheese on them.\n\nWife got the Blue Mooo burger ($12.50) and pronounced it her favorite so far. I got the Cubano sandwich ($11). It was good, but using pulled pork instead of the traditional roast pork, really lessens the experience. The dijonaise could be more assertive as well. For both, we received a ridiculous amount of fries. Seriously if anyone from the management reads this, please cut the amount by 25%. It won't be missed (except by THOSE customers).\n\nCocktails (Green Goblin, Cerinopolitan) were very good and worth the expense ($8e). I do take umbrage at the prices of the beer selections. I mean, $3 for Coors (not that I would drink that swill). $5.50 for Sierra Nevada? One could almost buy an entire 6 pack for that amount.
