I've had the astute pleasure of visiting a few major league ballparks in my day and I can't say that PNC Park has a rival. If you're wanting to experience downtown Pittsburgh and the culture of life on the Ohio river, then a Pirates game is all you need. It was a tall order, but I booked a group of 18 GA tickets for a summer game against the Nats. Though wrangling a group that large is no small feat, it was still an absolutely blast. The Pirates also domniated. Win-Win. \n\nFor a modern ballpark with everything being relatively state-of-the-art, you still feel like you're there for the old ballgame. Even though it's a rather large ballpark, you still feel pretty close to the field. It's like a perfect in between of the White Sox field and Wrigley -- Plenty of nostalgia and tons to keep all ages entertained. \n\nParking, of course, was a nightmare, but who cares when you have that much to look at. It seems the smarter option is to park across the bridge and then walk across the river, if you feel like hoofing it. \n\nSeriously, though. 7th Inning Stretch and Italian ice while watching America's favorite pastime? Oh, and throw in several homers making it into the water, gorgeous weather to boot, and all that energy just made for a monumental evening. \n\nWell done, PNC Park. You have my vote.
