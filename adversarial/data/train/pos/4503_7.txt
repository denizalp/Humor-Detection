\"It's like a mixture of yoga poses and some weird sexual positions.\"-The Getaway: Bangkok episode on a Thai massage.\n\nAfter watching a clip of Chrissy Teigen getting pulled and stretched in different ways, I was curious as to how a Thai massage would feel like. Thanks to good ol' Yelp, I was geared to this place.\n\nCalled a little after they opened to make an appointment at 6p. Located in a plaza right next to Hedary's, you'll find this very small \"spa.\" As I walked in, I was greeted by a handful of petite, Thai women. I was honestly apprehensive as to how legit this place would be. I couldn't help but think if happy ending places were foreal? Haha\n\nMy massage therapist was Jasmine. Read about her in a few reviews and requested her. I originally wanted the 60 min Thai massage but she recommended the 60 min combo massage which I'm glad I ended up going for. It was a mix of Thai and Swedish with hot oil and hot stones at the end. The room was small with two beds with music lightly playing in the background. \n\nThe massage was great and Jasmine was very pleasant and accommodating. If you have any problem areas that need special attention, they'll make sure to cover those areas. She was initially a bit hesitant to step on my back but she said after feeling how tight my muscles were, she could do it and it honestly ended up being my favorite part. The stretching parts were a bit awkward but did provide relief. She told me I \"looked flexible\" and really forced me into stretches. Very similar to some yoga moves! Just as good as she was with her feet, she was good with her hands too. I felt the tension being released and my knots getting undone. It hurt but in the most positive way.\n\nOverall, a good find. I left feeling a lot better and so relaxed. I plan to become a regular and recommend this place to anyone. $65 for an hour and definitely worth it.\n\nThey also have a punch card. After your 10th massage, you get an hour free!
