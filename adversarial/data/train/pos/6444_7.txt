Located in a run down strip mall and has been there many years. This \"grand opening\" sign is BS. There are too many Thai restaurants in this vicinity to have poor customer service. The aging waitress was too busy flirting with the older, caucasian male to worry about the only other customer in the place. He was ranting and raving about how great the soup was that she had served him 5 minutes prior. Being it was cold outside and I absolutely LOVE soup, I asked the aging server and customer, \"Which soup is that?'' The server rudely said, \" We no serve to public!\" Well! After this display, Thai Spice will no longer have to worry about serving anything to me. I will take my business (a couple blocks to the west) to Archies. Archies is AWESOME and has yet to insult!
