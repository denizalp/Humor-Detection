Pros:\nAbout 90% of the time I've had a good haircut at Coupe Bizzarre.  The stylists do a great job in giving you what you want, and they can put together some pretty cutting edge styles.  (Pun intended.... wah wah.)  \n\nCons: \nI recommended Coupe Bizzarre to a friend who was new to town from Germany and...... an incident occurred where she ended up coming out with a slightly more modern mullet.  She was upset for weeks and had to get it fixed elsewhere.  \nThe salon is not relaxing in the slightest.  The music is super loud, and bounces badly off the concrete floor and walls. \nThe staff can be a bit too snobby\/trendoid for my liking.  I constantly feel like I have to read a copy of Vice before walking in.  \nI always get the feeling that the salon is a little bit unhygienic.  Potentially because customers are placed so closely together, or because the fact that there is hair EVERYWHERE mixed together (I know, this is to be expected in a salon, but because the floors are concrete it shows up even more prominently), and on the stylist's clothing.  \nThe lights are so bright I end up sweating like Richard Simmons in a workout video.  \n\nSo all in all - come here if you want a really awesome haircut, but not for everything in between.
