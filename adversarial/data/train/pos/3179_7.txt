I had no idea this place was here. Randomly found it once day when I was trying to find a new place for lunch. \nI've been here a few times, and I love it. Great for finding those movies you can't get at Red Box. But they also have some new releases as well. \n\nThe Bf is on a mission to show me all the Marvel movies in chronological order so we'll definitely be back for more. So far he's only been out of one movie that we wanted, Wolverine Origins (the library didn't have it either - what's the deal?) Anyway, he said he should have it in a week or so. \n\nGreat selection! We've also been renting some oldie movies that I haven't seen. Showgirls! I wasn't missing much, lol. \n\nThis place also has movies & collectibles for sale. Was able to get my mom a few early Christmas presents. Love that! Keep up the good work, Movies & Candy! Also, pretty cool that you can rent out the theatre. I saw last time we were there and it looks pretty nice. Might have to try that some day.
