I used to work in the area and would come here at least once a month. I found their ribs to be great.\n\nDuring a return visit here, I still enjoyed my ribs (with a baked potato) but they weren't as good as I remembered it (but still very good in my opinion). Depending on the time that you go, parking generally isn't an issue unless you want to park very close to the restaurant.\n\nI went with a friend and we decided to eat at the bar at my friend's suggestion. He decided to order the steak and I had my usual which was ribs with an all dressed baked potato. His steak came with fries which he was unable to finish so he gave me some of his fries.\n\nThe ribs are still \"fall off the bone\" ribs so the meat is not stuck on the bone and using a fork, the meat easily falls off. The all dressed baked potato was also very good. It comprised of cheese, sour cream, bacon bits, and shallots.
