This review is just on the customer service as I didn't have a chance to try their food or beer (due to customer service or lack of).\n\nWe walked in after a walk at \"The Park\" and sat at the bar (since there was no hostess) we waited at the bar without any acknowledgement from the staff whatsoever. They seemed bothered for some reason? Anyhow, not our fault. We waited and never got asked anything. Shortly after, a couple arrived next to us and immediately got attended? Not only is that rude but unprofessional seeing as the bartender was right in front of us. We let that slide and waited a bit more and still did not get help! Not sure what their problem was but we left. Will not be coming back. Sad because it seems like a pretty decent place with good atmosphere. Customer service is everything.
