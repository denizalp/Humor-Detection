The only good thing about this Starbucks is location! \n\nIf you meeting someone at Finch Station on a cold winter night, you can get your coffee fix without even getting out in the cold! \n\nI don't think I can ever get a seat here... all the patrons are circling around like sharks ready to jump in any open seats... Most of the patrons are young Koreans.. not my crowd but someone might love to people watching here! \n\nAnd the drink I ordered, Skinny Caramel Macchioto ($ 3.75) is pathetic. I know why it is call skinny and low in calories.. because it tasted like water? hot water? that's should be 0 calories... and for that price....Now I never want one of those skinny drinks anymore!\n\nFree Wifi access... if I can get a chair and table then i might utilize that ...
