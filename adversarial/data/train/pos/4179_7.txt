09\/07\/10\n\nCame here on a coworker's suggestion.  He made sure I understood him when he said it was a dive.  Yes, Bill, I get it.  Once that was out of the way, he then said that this is where his family went for good noodles at least three times a month.  He's right- SB doesn't have much of an atmosphere, and it soon became clear that the majority of their business was in takeout sales (many were college students or middle-aged males).  So busy in fact, that my simple order of crab puffs and combo (beef and pork) noodles took longer than I'd expected (20-25 minutes).  \n\nThe crab puffs were actually decent-- I would've preferred a toastier look.  However, they were nicely crisped, and not too greasy.  That is, after I'd toss them over a few hundred paper towels.  The noodles were tasty, and I preferred the saltier pork over the sweet beef.  (If only the noodle dish I ordered at China Magic the next day was as tasty as this one was!)  Be sure to have someone with you to share, bec. this entree won't taste as good the next day-- the noodles dried up overnight in the fridge.
