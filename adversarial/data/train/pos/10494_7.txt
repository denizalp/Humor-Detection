There's a new donutorium in town. It's not much to look at now because there's still some construction and winter going on but it ought to clean up pretty well by spring... \nBright and clean only-donuts shop. Windows facing north and west have a nice view across the parking lot out to WT Harris Blvd. Drive-thru goes around back but I don't think you can see the display from your car so you may as well go inside and get your donuts like a grown up.
