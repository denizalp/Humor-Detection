NEVER GO HERE!\nI brought in 8 garments and when I picked them up... a cashmere sweater had a massive yellow stain on the front and back and my silk shirt came back looking tie-dyed and completely unpressed or steamed.  Both were very expensive and now are completely ruined.  The other 6 garments had to all be repressed and steamed because they were so wrinkled. I am absolutely appalled at the quality of service and can't believe they are in business with results like these!  DO NOT BRING YOUR CLOTHES HERE IF YOU DON'T WANT THEM RUINED!!!!
