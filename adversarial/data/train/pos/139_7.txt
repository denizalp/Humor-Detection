Our usual Tuesday get together usually involves wings and beer. Lately, it's been the Wing King in Fort Mill. This time, we decided to get past the fact that this WK is actually in a gas station plaza and give it a try.\n\nI opted for 15 honey hot BBQ boneless wings. A little drippy in the sauce department, but the chicken bits were cooked right, the sauce tasted great and they were piping hot.\n\nGood choice. Beer specials, or at least reasonably priced beer. Lots of stuff that's been fried. What's not to love?
