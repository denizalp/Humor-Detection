This is place is really unique, from decorations to the flavors of the gelato, Gelatology is really different.\n\nMy visit started with a guy greeting us warmly with free samples. There were so many odd combinations, but they were all so good! Flavors include: figs & goat cheese, cheese & crackers, sweet potato cheesecake, avocado with chocolate chips, and the list goes on! \n\nWhat I really like about this place is the vegan options; there was a wide variety to chose from. I ended up getting a half and half cup with one side avocado with chocolate chips and lavender macaroon--BOTH VEGAN and BOTH DELICIOUS. \n\nThe price is fairly reasonable too. I got a 6 oz portion and it ended up being about $6, and the scoops were very generous. \n\nBe sure to sample all the flavors before choosing so you know what you're getting yourself into. ¯\\_(ツ)_\/¯
