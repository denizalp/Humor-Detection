**Closed business, but still leaving this review to ensure it follows Dr. Kwon into his next practice should that happen.**\n\nOn February 7th, 2018, I pulled into the Derma Aura parking lot to swap out a bottle of Glytone Face Wash. No appointment, just my typical every 6-8 months product purchase, or in this case, a swap. \n\nWalked up to the door of the clinic as I always had to find a sign that said \"Office is closed for renovations\". \n\nOk, that's fine. I'll come back in a week. \n\nWhat struck me as odd was the number of patients chilling in the parking lot, some cussing up a storm about no courtesy call to cancel their appointments. \n\nIt was then I was approached by a woman named Connie who had learned Dr. Kwon and his PA Christina Todd would not be returning to practice and he had sold the practice to Affiliated Dermatology.\n\nThat's also fine. \n\nWhat is completely unacceptable is that he didn't inform any of his patients who had appointments that this was going down. \n\nNo letter, no phone calls, nothing. A highly unprofessional exit strategy for a physician.  \n\nI even read on the Ahwatukee 411 Facebook group of a woman's husband who had MOHS surgery and had to seek an alternate provider to have the stitches removed from his scalp. They're not even sure if all the stitches were removed seeing as Dr. Kwon\/Derma Aura have the records.\n\nMe? I had a biopsy in December 2017, which was benign. The spot has since returned, and with my history, that usually means there's something more risky going on like atypical moles (I've had multiple excision procedures performed by Dr. Kwon over the years). \n\nI had to wait until this week to finally get an appointment with the Affiliated Dermatology practice and I'm hoping this spot is still benign. \n\nI don't think this is the last we'll hear about Dr. Kwon, strongly suspect something was at play for him to shut down so quickly and unprofessionally. Just wait for it, guys. \n\nShould Dr. Kwon ever return to practice, he will not be getting my or my family's business. \n\nAnd keep in mind, our family trusted this man for close to 15 years with our dermatological issues, and never had a problem. Loved this doctor! \n\nNow there's a problem and a bad taste left in my mouth due to this highly unprofessional stunt. \n\nGood luck and Godspeed to you, sir, you're going to need it.
