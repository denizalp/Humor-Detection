I was trying to pawn some computer monitors for a friend; figured this would be the fastest way to unload them. This was the first time I have ever tried to pawn something. It was one of the most depressing, demoralizing experiences I have had for a long time. There are numerous windows to sell your stuff, but only one was staffed, making for a long line of desperate-looking people, their bored, screaming children, and staff who looked like security guards or cops. I ended up abandoning my items there and leaving in frustration after almost a 30 minute period where the line did not move at all. F*** this horrible place.
