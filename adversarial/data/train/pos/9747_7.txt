Always a fun adventure since I never know what I will find here.  The store is very spacious , with exceptionally long aisles that are filled with all types of merchandise. Specialty foods, toys and pet needs, stationary products and much more.\n\nAt one time ,they carried clothing, but I haven't noticed it displayed the last few times I was there.\n\nThe shop is mainly stocked with household merchandise ranging from essential goods to decorative. They always have a nice section dedicated to seasonal items so everything usually looks fresh and welcoming throughout the year. \n\nNot sure how it came to be known as Tuesday Morning, but I love stopping in whatever day of the week it is. \n\nCheck hours of operation , since they tend to close much earlier than other retail stores.
