First, what I DO like about K-9 Club: They don't sell animals. I find most pet stores unethical in their treatment of animals. With that out of the way.....\n\nThis used to be my go-to store for litter and cat and dog food. With 3 cats and a dog at home, I was a pretty regular customer.\n\nLast time I visited, the owner stood chatting on the phone the whole time, while the girl behind the counter had a leisurely chat with her friend. Not once did either of them make even the slightest of gestures to me, ask if I needed anything, or even apologize for being tied up. After several minutes of making an effort to be noticed, I left. I found another pet supply store which had a better selection and better prices, and although the salesperson was busy she DID take the time to ask if I needed assistance. \n\nAnother story - recently, just before going out of town I needed to stock up on cat food.  As time was tight, I called ahead to ensure that they would be open when we arrived.  When I got there, the owner told me that she wouldn't be able to sell me the bag of cat food that I needed even though it was 5 minutes before closing because she had a wedding to go to. Really? I had to beg her to take the 15 seconds to ring through my bag of cat food.\n\nAnother thing that I was not happy with was the 'promotion' that they run with Orijin cat and dog food. Originally, we were told that if we bought 10, the 11th was free. When we finally accumulated enough UPC codes + receipts, I received the run around from the owner trying to avoid giving us our loyalty bag. I got all kinds of excuses, and the number of purchases needed kept going up until it was 14 or 15 UPC codes in total.\n\nMy wife has also complained to me several times about being spoken to rudely by the owner. I am taking my money elsewhere and will never go back.\n\nIn summary: Extremely poor customer service. She doesn't care about her customers at all. Avoid at all costs.
