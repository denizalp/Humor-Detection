It's not really a gun store.  It's just another Vegas tourist trap.  Oh sure, you can buy a gun.  I think they had three.  But they have T-Shirts!  Wahoo!.  The range was way out of line.  In Utah you can shoot full auto for $10 an hour plus ammo.  This place would charge you $500 for the same thing.\nGo North if you really want to buy a gun.
