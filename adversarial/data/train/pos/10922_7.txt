We jumped on the $375 roundtrip deal from Vegas to Honolulu. The flight was very smooth both ways and we got to and from Hawaii safely, so thats where they get three stars.\n\nHere's some helpful tips if you do plan to fly with Allegiant:\n\nBring those comfortable neck pillow thingys if you're on a long flight...seats don't recline\n\nIf you sit in the emergency exit rows, you can sit with your spouse and not  have any random spot...more leg room too.\n\nYou are allowed 1 carry on and 1 personal item...avoid baggage charges if you can\n\n40 pounds is the limit for your carry on, and MUST fit in that carry on sizing thing...if it doesn't you will be charged\n\nBring an empty water bottle and fill up at the airport, no complimentary stuff here...\n\nBring snacks and pack some good grub...they offer stuff you'd get in a vending machine\n\nBring stuff to keep you entertained...no entertainment here either\n\nLike they say....you get what you pay for...ALOHA!!!
