I don't have insurance so this is a great place to get the pill. I need it for medical reasons, if I go without it I will feel just horrible, they have many options including having them delivered, very convenient and reliable. Their rates for check ups are very reasonable. \n\nI did have one complaint, they started only being open every other Saturday, but their hour of operation list on the site didn't reflect that. I drove all the way over there and it was closed at 1:30pm.\n\nAll around a great place, ample parking, great landmarks in the area, and not that many protesters to annoy you.
