Bridwell to the rescue! I love supporting local, especially when they love to come to the rescue to customers! Bridwell does this well. This morning, I woke up to find some issues with my car. Not only was I long (ok, very long...like thousands of miles long) overdue for an oil change, the AC also started acting weird and I needed to get my car looked at before driving to Tucson. \n\nI stopped by Bridwell and they first took a look at my tires and fluids. I needed to top off the air on my tires and add coolant and brake fluid. They did all this within five minutes. Then I asked if they'd have some time to do an oil change and look over my car today. They said absolutely. So I came back an hour later, dropped off my car to Jack Lindsay around 11:00 and went on my way. Well, there's good news and bad news to my visit. The bad news is that while my AC turned out to be fine, my front brakes were ready to go out on me so I needed those replaced. But the good news is that they were able to do this and my oil change in record timing and I picked up my car by 4:00! \n\nThe service was excellent. Jack was friendly and attentive to my car's issues and explaining them to me. The price was competitive to what I would have paid elsewhere and more importantly, they didn't charge me dealer service prices (phew!). Now this may look like a little gas station on the outside, but not only are they one of the last stations to offer the full service option, but they also have a fully functioning mechanic center that can fix my car and service it as well. \n\nI will continue to visit Bridwell and I like that I can support a local, family-owned business and leave with a fully functioning car on top of it! Thanks for coming to my rescue Bridwell! I even got to stop in for an iced coffee from AJ's on my way out.
