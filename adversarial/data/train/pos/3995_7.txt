One star because we got decently priced tickets to the shows we wanted to see, minus four stars because of the shitty attitude of the bitch behind the counter.\n\nThe line wasn't bad, we had minimal up-selling and little interaction with the line handler. Get to the desk to purchase our tickets and it went bad - quickly!\n\nWe had been told they had 40+ tickets in the price range we wanted for Mystere, in the 30 seconds it took my husband to explain that in French to his parents they were all gone and we'd have to get the tickets in the higher price range.  Once he found out we were also buying tickets to Penn & Teller he started to push the buffet vouchers, told him no at least 10 times before he got huffy and makes a snide comment about stupidly winging it instead. Since my in-laws were seeing Mystere and we had to show ID to get the tickets we gave my mother-in-laws passport, as I was attempting to show him where the information on the page he snatched it away and entered the information, the wrong information. As she hands over the card to pay he says he can't take the card because it's different than what was on the ID we'd provided. This goes on for a few minutes and we show him where he messed up. Again we get bitchy attitude, he grabs the credit card from my mother-in-law, we're talking pissed off grab and yank, has her sign and tells us to leave. WTF?!? \n\nWe have purchased tickets from this location on every trip to Vegas, always with good results. But after Mr. Bitch of Las Vegas 2013 I don't think we'll be back.
