Orfus Road is already Outlet City in Toronto, and this Le Chateau outlet is one of the queens on the strip.\n\nI know, Le Chateau is super cheap and skeezy sometimes, and they sell so many pleather knee-high boots and furry coats that it makes you want to scream...\n\nBut this place is worth checking out on Orfus Road. I used to stop in religiously during high school, partially because my high school was pretty close by, but also because they often have crazy sales where all their shirts are $3 and the shoes are $10.\n\nAnd I've gotten some AWESOME cheap Halloween costumes here.
