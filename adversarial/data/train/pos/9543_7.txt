Went to 2 strip clubs last night the 1st was across the street from Arizona mills, it was garbage, women were tweekers music was old as hell. Felt like I was tony Montana the 80s. 2nd club  was this place and they didn't not disappoint. Women were all shades and shapes from thick and slim and a variety of bad chicks. I'm big on music and dj was on fire all the latest music. Mostly hip hop which I love cause let face it who wants to watch strippers dance to Taylor swift or sum bs. Drinks where kinda pricey, I would def pregame b4 going. But tha girls where on point. Shoutout to blue. She had me on cock diesel all night. Will definitely be back when the homies wanna step out again. Comparable to Starz (la) kod(mia) onyx (atl) Dg's(d town) da rhino is where its at
