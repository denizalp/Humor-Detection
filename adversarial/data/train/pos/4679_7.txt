My next Friday night adventure at Roll dot com (aka kimbap dot com) is the tteokbokki (aka ddeokbokki aka ddukboggi aka ddukpoggi aka the Green Lantern but you don't hasta call me topokki[1][2]). However you spell it, you can order by saying \"duck po key\". \n\nThe ajumma taking my order giggled at my order. A whitey ordering tteokbokki in a Korean restaurant is -- to quote the colorful language of Roddy Doyle in \"The Van\" -- like hearing a five-year old saying \"fuck\". It's unexpected. \n\nThe ajumma packed it up in a tight styro container that survived a trip my backpack. I handed over $3 and change.\n\n\"Spicy\" she warned me. I try to slip into survival Korean mode at things like this to let the server know I have a grasp of basic Korean cuisine (a curious feature of the Korean language is it's actually impossible to learn Korean without learning about Korean food) and I'm not going to be back at night with kerosene soaked rags and burn their place down thinking some joker there spiked my noodles with Tabasco sauce.\n\n\"Neh, neh. May-oon.\" (Yes, yes, spicy.)\n\n\"Do you speak Korean?\"\n\n\"Jak-un\" (a little)\n\n\"Good!\" (big nosed devil is not going to be back with kerosene soaked rags and burn my business down)\n\n\"Kam sa ham ni da\" (do you know how much kerosene costs these days? So not worth it.)\n\nSo what did we get for our $3 and space invader money? Well, not the best tteokbokki. But passable. Surely. There are no doubt regional variations and even variations by street in Korea. Maybe this was a variation I was unfamiliar with. I always like the kind with a boiled egg sliced or halved. No egg in this one. You get the basic tube rice cakes, the hot sauce (which is spicy and at the edge of my ability to tolerate spice), and the odeng fish (familiar to some as that little textured fish cake stuff you get as an appetizer at  a Korean restaurant). Found at the bottom were some shredded carrots and cabbage. I don't recall cabbage in any tteokbokki I had in Seoul. But it wasn't bad and actually enjoyable. \n\nThe stuff is also physically hot. Takes a good long while for it to cool down. You can also barbarian it up a bit by scooping it onto some rye bread.\n\n_________________\n[1] http:\/\/joongangdaily.joins.com\/article\/view.asp?aid=2906086\n[2] http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=LztZu5s0-QU
