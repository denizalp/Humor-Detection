A great alternative to the punks over at Cartel Coffee. At One Coffee they don't pretend to know what is best for you and they will make your coffee to order (how original!). The place forgoes the \"look how trendy ass kissin' this place looks\" and instead go for familiarity and comfort. \n\nIt's actually very Starbuck-esque inside. \n\nThe coffee itself is smooth as a baby's ass ... not in the least bitter or tart.
