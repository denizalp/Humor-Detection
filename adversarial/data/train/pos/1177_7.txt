So amazing, wish I could go back to Vegas now and grub- I had the Lobster Tempura Roll it was the first time I have had this combination and it was esquisite. The table had quit a few different things and all were extremly happy. We were there for buisiness and made a reservation but when we were there we easily could have walked in, maybe it was early for Vegas becasue as we were leaving it seemed to be getting more packed. All in all go- ill be returning!!
