I saw Holly at the 67th location, although she's nice, she DID NOT do a good job with my hair. I got a \"trim\" and a \"blowout\", and my hair looked exactly the same as it did when I walked in. I love getting blowouts because my previous hair stylists do such a great job giving me voluminous hair with the perfect \"flips\" at the end, but Holly was unable to achieve this look. She didn't even put any product in my hair. I could have done a better job myself. \n\nReally disappointed and wish I didn't waste my money here.
