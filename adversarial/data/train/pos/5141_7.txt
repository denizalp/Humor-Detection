Here in Vegas for a weekend escape, grown & sexy needed some steak.  I searched yelp and looked for my Elite comrades to lead me to the promised land.  Bam!  They lead me to the Palms Casino to N9ne Steakhouse.\n\nWe walked in on a muggy Sunday nite, hostess was friendly but I must admit the club - style decor thru me off.  It just didn't feel like a steakhouse, but that's just my previous steakhouse experiences clouding my judgement.  But the lighting was weirdly fluorescent dim like a murder might take place but the space is spread out nicely.  On the positive side there was lots of elbow room here, not all cramped in a musty old dining room.  Waiter was real chill and helpful.  And the food?  The ribeye steak was cooked to PERFECTION.  The mac and cheese was great and so was the bread basket.  Honestly, the steak is up there with Mastro's and that says a lot!  I will come back here for sure when I want a steak in Vegas.  Don't bother going anywhere else.
