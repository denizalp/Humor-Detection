This was my favorite food spot in the Hard Rock Hotel!!!\n\nSmall ... casual ...basically a kitchen with bar seats around it . Fits like 10 people . \n\nMenu is small but damnit the food was excellent! Fresh and delicious! \n\nCajun Corn chowder soup was pretty good! \n\nThe shrimp cocktail was fresh and delicious \n\nAnd the best thing EVER was the Calamari fries!!! YUM YUM YUM!!! \n\nI definitely recommend this place
