Great Fountain Fast Food has been here one of the longest, located smack in the middle of the whole food court and takes up the most space with a flashing LED sign. Therefore, it also receives the most attention and business. Occasionally, I see police officers come here and eat as well. This place is usually packed with people, especially high schoolers during the lunch break.\n\nA ton of choices, and the food comes really fast. Last night we got the sizzling teppanyaki hot plate, and it came with fries, pork chops, chicken skillet, sausages, one large piece of broccoli, a soup, some spaghetti and I should have received a bubble tea as well, but they didn't have any tapioca left and asked if I wanted any other \"normal drink\". I think they could have compensated for it, because bubble tea is more expensive, and if it came with the meal, they could have at least asked if we wanted two regular drinks (as I came with my family), or at a discounted price. All this was for less than $10. \n\nAnyways, similar to all teppanyakis at Chinese restaurants, once they pour on the sauce and the plate is brought to the table, EVERYONE in the whole room looks at you cause of the loud noise the teppanyaki plate brings. The food itself is of course Chinese-styled, it's not really comparable to places that do teppanyaki right in front of you as they carefully grill piece by piece in front of you, but, this is definitely worth trying and worth the price. If you go to any other place and order this, sometimes you're looking at around $20 for this kind of meal.
