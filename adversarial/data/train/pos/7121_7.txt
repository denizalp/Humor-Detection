Skins 6|2 is the epitome of aloof and luxuriously fabulous skincare, cosmetics, and fragrance.\n\nCANDLES: What I found most appealing was their candle and home fragrance selection. This 1st class boutique features high-end brands such as Diptyque, Tocca, Becca, etc. Fancy candles are kind've my thing. Diptyque would have to be my favorite... its like the Chanel of candle wax.\n\nSERVICE: Normally,  I would go to Barneys to purchase my Tuberose Diptyque candles. Walk-in, point, and a sales associate would be \"more than happy to\" ring me up. In other words, \"I would be more than happy to get commission for this sale. And I will proceed to be completely non-conversational and awkward.\" The associate at Skins 6|2 actually conversed with me and shared the rest of the diptyque collection with me. She told me a particular one was a limited edition. If I liked it I probably would've bought it from her... She showed me the 'proper' way to smell a candle too (which I didn't know) and was actually quite the sweet heart. I've worked in luxury retail for quite some time and I know good service when I see it.\n\nOVERALL: I purchased an over-priced candle and some Deborah Lippman nail polishes that day. And I will be returning here again! An amazing selection of products that you can't find anywhere else. Great for personal use & GIFTS! And icing on the cake is a friendly sales girl.
