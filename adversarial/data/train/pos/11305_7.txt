PF Chang's gets my award for WORSE RESTAURANT OF 2014. Which is saying a lot if you read my review on kintori yakitori. \n\nMy first time here a few months ago we were seated in the lounge and the server was coughing like crazy! As she was talking to us and when she'd walk from the tables to the kitchen were constant phlegm filled coughs that filled the restaurant. She sounded like she needed to go to the hospital. My gf and I left immediately. \n\nSecond visit started out fine, no coughing by servers, and our server was very nice. But this is where the joy ends. \n\nThe food for the most part is ATROCIOUS. We had the \"dine for two\" deal so we had a wide taste of what they have to offer. \n\nVegetable soup\/chicken lettuce wrap- these were actually decent, but I don't think this soup exists in chinese cuisine. and the chicken lettuce wrap was served with vulgar sauces on the side that didn't go with the wrap. This unhealthy focus on sauce would prove fatal for the rest of the meal, as most of the dishes were drowned in way too much sauce. \n\nchang's chicken and mongolian beef- apparently the house specialities and their most popular dishes. HOW IS THIS POSSIBLE? they are literally the worse single dish I have had since I can remember. Chang's chicken commits the worst sin possible by using that crappy presidents choice sweet and sour sauce you can buy by the jar. And they drown the chicken bits in the sauce essentially turning them in to candy. It reminds me of the \"plum sauce\" children get with their chicken fingers at a 1990's golden griddle. I ALWAYS finish eating what i am served, but for the first time since I was born I was forced to stop half way. This dish was that bad. \n\nmongolian beef- i will concede that they did cook the beef nicely, but again put WAY TOO MUCH salty soy sauce . more water was drank than beef in order to get the beef down. and why on earth would you serve beef with so much green onion? for 18 bucks lets get some real vegetables in here!\n\nboth the chicken and the beef were also of unacceptable sizes for the price. huge rip off. \n\nafter realizing that this was going to be the most americanized chinese meal of my life i thought they couldn't possibly mess up dessert. we got cheesecake and red velvet cake... the most american dessert possible. and yet they disappoint. the cheese cake tasted like it was prepared by children using an \"easy-bake\" oven from the 90's. and the red velvet was just a freakish amount of icing. \n\nThis restaurant is an insult to chinese cuisine, and represents everything that is wrong with american diets. Too much sauce, salt, sugar, and not enough veggies. \n\nCONCLUSION:\n-dont' come here unless you want diabetes, or hypertension\n-if you want \"exotic\" food try \"linda modern thai\" around the corner from this place.
