5 vegetarian samosas for A DOLLAR. \nAmazing and delicious. \nI once bought 60 for a party (apparently you only need to order in advance if you want more then a few hundred of them). Driving to the party with a couple bags of fresh samosas has convinced me that there should be a samosa air refresher.
