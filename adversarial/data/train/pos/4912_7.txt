I went into this location to find a new gym for my fiance and I.. Brenden the sales membership rep was great. He took us on a tour and gave us reasonable quote for the membership. When I told Brenden I was going to come back tomorrow to finalize my decision he grabbed his general manager \"Gonzo\". Gonzo offered us a better deal considering he wanted to close the sale. When I told Gonzo I would be back tomorrow to finalize my decision he got very angry. He got up and walked away without saying thank you. It seemed like since I didn't seal the deal then that he got upset. I was going to go back today to join but since the GM of the store acted like a child I will be joinging else where. Great job Gonzo, your ego got in the way of a potential customer. Brenden, I recommend that your corporate office comes in and promote you to that leadership role. -Kevin
