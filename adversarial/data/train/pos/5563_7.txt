Who the heck told me that Paris has the BEST breakfast buffet??? I need to punch you.\n\nOkay, man who made fresh omelettes to my liking, I liked you.  BUT THAT'S ALL!  I could eat the exact same yummy omelette every morning in a dorm cafeteria, I wouldn't exactly call the omelette at Le Village extra special.\n\nAnd the rest!?  Scrambled eggs 10 ways.  Whacksauce!!!!!!!  Crepe station....meh.  And don't be fooled into thinking the pastries are just like France either....they are SO not.\n\nThat'll be $22.99 for the omelette that I liked.  Oh dear!  I would so rather eat a breakfast sandwich at Earl's.  At least I came at 7:30 and didn't have to wait in the hour line that was formed by the time I finished.\n\nSo I didn't exactly pay $22.99, I did the 24 hour buffet pass...And well,  I decided to come back here for lunch to see if it could redeem itself.\n\nVerdict?  The prime rib was good, but the only excellent item was the creme brulee.\n\nOverall, the wait here is way too long and the food is not good enough to make up for it.  Not the complete picture but let's just say breakfast and lunch didn't impress me enough to ever try dinner.  COLLECT  $79.97 (breakfast: 22.99, lunch 23.99, and dinner 32.99) and PASS GO. As in, go somewhere else.
