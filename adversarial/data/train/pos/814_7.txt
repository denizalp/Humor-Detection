YAZZ HONEY YAZZ!!\n\nI just checked into this hotel and I am in heaven all ready.  It is beautiful and I just could not wait to post a review.  This review is strictly for the suite.  Following my five day stay, I will post an update regarding my overall experience. \n\n The room is absolutely breath-taking!.  It is very clean and very modern, (see the photos).  It has beautiful tones of blue, gray and deep gold, (carpet) that pair very well with the warm wood.  \n\nWhen you walk into the suite, there is a built-in room divider separating the bedroom from the lounge area.  Each  space has a television and ambient lighting, not that harsh blinding light that is so common in hotel rooms.   The lounge area is opposite the kitchen and has two upholstered chairs and tables  for relaxing.\n\nThis suite has a full kitchen and is comes with cookware and utensils.  I was not quite sure what to expect so I brought along a portable kitchen, (induction) that I still might use because it is fun and allows me to cook on the peninsula.  \n\nThis is definitely a \"come up\" from last night's experience which was slightly atrocious.  I am so happy to be here and my Honey has absolutely redeemed himself!\n\n9\/22\/16\n\n It is day five and yes, I am still enjoying my visit.  We happened to get a room toward the rear of the property so we are very close to a exit and our van is conveniently located.  Coming and going has been great:!\n\nThe bed is a dream, simply perfect in every way.  I have slept well each and every night.\n\nI love being able to scan my security card instead of having to actually insert it in the door.\n\nThere is a very nice lobby  with various sitting options that offers casual seating with your guests or a place to enjoy breakfast.\n\nWe haven't really needed anything but additional towels and the staff has been immediately responsive.\n\nWe were due to check out today but we have added an additional day. Yaaaaay!  If we ever stay in the area again, we will definitely choose this hotel and this specific room again.\n\n***This hotel is conveniently located right off the freeway and very close to a shopping area.  Everything is within 5 minutes.
