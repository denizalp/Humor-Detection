Not that I hit the nightlife much nowadays, but if my partying cuts short before 3AM (when they close) then I'm for sure making my way to HK Seafood Garden!\n\nNelson & Sylvia Q. tipped us in on the secret reverse happy hour. You won't see it advertised and they sure as heck won't tell you about it. But after 10pm, you can order off the lunch menu. When our group of 5 was seated, they handed us the dinner menus. After inquiring about the lunch menus, I discovered the lunch menu is the dinner menu at lunch prices. Specifically, cheap lunch prices. Dinner entrees wavered around $12-15 and nothing on the lunch menu was over $7.50. Step aside Pho Kim Long, HK Seafood is officially my new spot for post-drink eats.\n\nMy Chinese of preference is Yunnan \/ Sichuan style but HK Seafood makes some of the Hong-Kong style classics amazingly. The salt & pepper shrimp, ribs, and chicken wings are awesome. The shrimp are pretty large and fried head-on. We also ordered a hot & sour soup, eggplant w\/ tofu pot (my favorite!), and HK-style seafood chow mein. *yum*
