I got a Yelp account especially so I could write this review\nMy laptop had so much spyware it was impossible to use!\nI do believe I made the problem even worse when I tried to fix the problem myself .\nThis tech was courteous and explained what needed to be done.  He also helped me figure out how to manage Windows 8 (ptui!)   \nService was quick, and the tech responded to all my questions.
