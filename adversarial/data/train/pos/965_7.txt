Do you get offended by racism, sexual content, swearing, making fun of sexuality, and political humor? If the answer is yes, then don't see this show. If you are like me, that being a person who hardly ever gets offended, then this show is for you and you will have an awesome time! You will see some things that can't be unseen. You will hear things that will make you think, should I be laughing? You of course will laugh with everyone else because hell it is funny! Stop being so PC all the damn time America!\n\nAnyway, this is a smaller venue and any seat is a good seat for viewing the stage. I would recommend when booking your seats to get a table or an aisle seat. I saw a bigger guy stuck between his girlfriend and another bigger lady on the other side of him. He looked miserable during the performance because he was all scrunched up and looked to be having a hard time finding a comfortable position. \n\nI would recommend bringing your own drink before the show. They do sell drinks before the performance but I don't remember seeing another come around during.
