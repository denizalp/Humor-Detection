What a great surprise this place was. My friends and I were driving around one day and saw this awesome barn looking warehouse. Weird I know but awesome! The place itself is called Barnone, cute right!? Fire and Brimstone was one of the first places we saw and smelt as soon as we walked in so almost right away we decided to grab some of this delicious smelling pizza. We were able to order here and then go to the brewery right across from this pizzaria and enjoy both this incredible pizza with some local brews. Speaking of local, one of the many great things about this place is that most of their ingredients are locally sourced. We got both the Prosciutto and Fig - prosciutto, fig, arugula, whipped ricotta, and added an egg and a special they had that day. And I don't remember the name and everything on the second pizza but it was a Mexican style pizza with chicken, a corn kind of slaw, and a cilantro cream. Both were very tasty, crust was bubbly and crunchy, and all around great wood fired pizza's.
