Who am I kidding with my original four star review??? We all knew I'd be bumping it up to five stars eventually. \n\nWell, looks like that eventually has come sooner rather than later. I decided to go back today (yes, for the second time within their first week of business) and try out a few other menu items. I also wanted to check out their patio on such a lovely Sunday afternoon. \n\nI am not disappointed to say that I thoroughly enjoyed myself once again. Our server was Jet (a staple at all Upward Projects restaurants) and he is always on top of his game. I'm glad to see he'll be hanging out at Federal Pizza...that means the staff will be as excellent as what you can find at all of their restaurants. I tried the caprese sandwich this time around and was pleasantly surprised. Pane Bianco may have a competitor here...the mozzarella was super fresh, the basil was fragrant, and the tomatoes were juicy and tangy. Not to mention the deliciously charred bread that was drizzled with olive oil. So tasty! The drinks were as lovely as before and the patio was perfection on a sunny fall day. \n\nSo hurry over my fellow Yelpers...I promise you'll enjoy every bite!
