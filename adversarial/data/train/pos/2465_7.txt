Everyone values different things when out shopping. Some only care about getting the latest styles, for others, price is king. For me, it's all about customer service. I work hard to earn my money, and I spend it at places that treat me with respect, not like I am annoying them. \n\nNordstrom's is exactly that place. The customer service here is world class, and they know how to take care of their customers. They have an amazing selection, and some decent deals, but their biggest product is service. It's so nice to come to their stores and be treated well by employees who care. Well done Nordy's!
