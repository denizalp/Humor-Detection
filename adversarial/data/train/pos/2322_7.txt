At 4:08PM I submitted my mobile order. I walked into the store a minute or two later. There were 3-4 people in line already. I take a seat and listen to every persons order come out wrong. At 4:28PM I asked how to cancel my order because 1\/3 of my lunch break was wasted standing in line. At 4:37, a manager told me to call 1-800-TacoBell. I called and they said I'll get my money back in 3 business days. \n\nThey could literally staff this store with special needs chimpanzees and they would be more capable than the sorry excuses for employees and managers that this store has.
