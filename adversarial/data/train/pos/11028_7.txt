This place gets 1 star because the actual retail space is fabulous.  However, after the magic of the overal esthetic wears off, you are left with ...ho-hum...the furniture.\n\nMy friend was shopping for a sectional sofa...nothing extraordinary or fancy, just a simple grey sectional with right side lounger section.   Well, we spotted a few that were inexpensive with the appropriate dimensions for her space...yay!  However, our glee quickly turned to disappointment once we spoke to the salesperson and were told that the sofas we liked, actually, most if not all of the sofas, were not available in any other fabric, footing or configurations than what was displayed on the floor.  WTF??!\n\nHow can you not give people options?!  It made no sense...up was down, black was white, wrong was right...I'm talking Bizzaro World people.\n\nOur salesperson explained that the reason they don't offer options is to keep the pricing down and ensure timely shipping of the furnitre, or some other BS like that...I honestly cannot say for certain what she said because I was in shock, still trying to process the fact that we couldn't actually chose a fabric or configuration to suit my friend's sectional sofa needs.\n\nOn the plus side, they do have a lot of TVs and some kick ass refridgerators and stoves...but even that selection is limited.  However all of this was negated by another simple fact...wait for it...\n\nTHEY DON'T HAVE CUSTOMER PARKING!!! GASP!\n\nOverall impression? Meh!
