Yet another chain with an \"Asian\" name which caters predominantly to the (sarcasm)\"white people\"(\/sarcasm) crowd.  The ambiance is great, reminds me of \"Earls\", if you like cookie-cutter, western style places, but don't expect anything authentic.\n\nThe service is normal, rushed \"Earl's\" type.  We didn't opt for 'all you can it' although, on a second thought, it might have been better value for the money.  We had the Sui Mai Dim Sum (highlight of the meal), I had the General Tao Chicken which was way too greasy and too breaded, and my girlfriend had Sizzling Bulgogi Platter, which tasted like regular shredded beef, none of that special bulgogi taste you get if you go to a proper Korean BBQ in Korea Town (Christy\/Bloor).\n\nWhen the bill came the tipping 'proposals' (for your convenience, you know) were 15%, 18% and 20%!!! What's up with these places along Yonge Street? Do they think only Americans eat there? This is not USA where wait stuff gets paid $2\/hr, but Canada, where they must get minimum wage or more.
