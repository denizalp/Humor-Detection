I suppose, if I really tried, I could probably do my OWN payroll.  Yeah.  Like I can do my own climbing of Aconcagua.  Or run my own 9.8 100 meters.  Or remember the lyrics to any song with more than ten words.\n\nSo, I don't.  I just let Ahola take care of all that.  (The payroll, not the climbing\/running\/remembering part.)  And they do just a swell job, too, with all the messy paperwork e-mailed every pay period, hard copy snail mailed, end of quarter stuff, end of year stuff.  It's so easy, some weeks I just stay in bed, watching Oprah and eating SnackWells.  \"YOU get SnackWells!  And YOU get SnackWells!  And YOU...\"\n\nHere's another aspect of their business, as you can see from the Ohio Historical Marker outside their office and pictured with this review:  They are a family-founded company.  and they are local.  So even my payroll is free-range locavore.  How sweet is that, I must ask?  And when I have some problem with payroll, as I did just this morning, I can waltz right in and speak with my representative, who remembers me, and my family, and my business, and I don't have to press seven to speak with someone who is pre-ignoring my problem.  Humans, working with humans.\n\n\"It takes 20 years to build a reputation and five minutes to ruin it. If you think about that, you'll do things differently.\"\n\n - Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffet
