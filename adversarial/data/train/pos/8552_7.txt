Value, value, value.  For the price of a room at most other places on the strip, you get a full on suite at the Jockey Club.  That suite comes complete with kitchen, pull out couch, multiple toilets, and decor that must be at least 40 years old.  Is it musty and tired looking?  Yes.  Does the majority of the clientel fit that description as well?  Yes.  Is it still a getto fabulous place to crash in the dead smack middle of the strip?  Damn yes.\n\nBonus points for not having any gambling.  Its kinda nice to walk to your room without having to deal with the incessant lights and sound of 5 am gamblers.   Not that I've ever been one of those losers.  Uh.  Yeah.  Lets move on.  Go Jockey Club!!!
