This location is one of the few late night sweet tooth options within walking distance for me (the others being a Slurpee at 7\/Eleven or an overpriced candy binge at Sugar Mountain). It's not fancy and it can get pretty crowded and loud on the weekends, but it does the trick in a pinch.\n\nSkip the pre-made desserts (despite their fun movie-themed names) and look on the back flap of the menu for the build-your-own options. The prices are identical and you get the same number of ingredients but in your exact specifications. \n\nOh, but don't try and view the \"menu\" options on their \"waycoolcafe.com\" website or you'll get a 2 second dizzying, blurry, flash view of the menu before it disappears and a generic list of \"highlights\" (\"15 fancy sundaes\") takes its place. Click on the \"Why can't I see inside your menu\" link and you get a disclaimer about \"world wide internet piracy\" giving them \"no alternative\" but to limit access to the actual menu. C'mon Demetres, get over yourself a little bit.
