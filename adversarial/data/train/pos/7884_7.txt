STAY AWAY! STAY FAR AWAY! RUNNNNN!!!!! Wish I could provide 0 stars.\n\nBooked a last minute trip to Vegas for the weekend and found that Circus Circus was going to be the cheapest (about $200 total for 2 nights). When we get there, we have to do the infamous hike with all our luggage from the Uber drop off on the Strip side of the hotel, through the Casino to the Lobby. When we were checking in, customer service could have been a little better but we were able to get checked in fairly quickly. Then we were informed that our room would be across the street and down the block. \n\nNow our new journey to the \"Manor\" buildings began. It was really across the street and down the block (walking away from the Strip). The lit up sign wasn't fully lit, most of the letters were dark outside of the building too. We get to the Manor area and I felt really uncomfortable with the building and the area. First of all, the hallways were dark and smelt musty. There were people opening the doors and yelling at people that were in the parking lot. The elevator was outdated, there were towels laying in the hallways to our room, janitor closets open - this place was just a hot mess! When we get to the room, the room furniture was outdated (not that big of a deal and at this point, the least of our worries. We were staying at Circus Circus and not expecting the room to look good) and the lights were flickering! Overall, we didn't feel safe as 2 girls staying here.\n\nWe were able to check out immediately and were offered an \"upgraded\" room that was still not in the main building. We explained that we wanted to forfeit our reservation because we didn't feel safe staying here. Not once were we asked why we didn't feel safe which is kind of alarming. But at least we made it out alive!
