Every time I come to Vegas, this is my Friday night club! This club is about the only few clubs ON the strip that actually plays hip-hop.  When you first get there, the security staff will search though it's not as extensive as Drais.  Then, you'll have to walk a flight of stairs up to their first club inside and from there you can order a drink before you go on the elevator that will lead you up to the rooftop where all the action happens.  There's not very many places you can stand because the security will tell you to move or don't sit on the chairs because they're reserved for VIP.  \n\nThe dress code is typical of what you'll see in Vegas but I've seen guest walk in there with a shirt, slacks and Jordans so I don't know what's up with that!? \n\nThe dance floor can get very overcrowded! So be prepared to be bumped and grinded on by some random drunk (guy and\/or girl).  \n\nFor me the club is only fun during the summer season when the rooftop is open. It's just not as fun inside during the winter season.  \n\nI really like this club. I rarely come across a rude staff member; they're usually nice to me even the DJ! \n\nIf you like an upscale ratchet club, this place is for you.
