I hate this place. 4 times in six months I had to take my 2012 accent and finally they find the problem.  They keep the car the week change the computer out. Great right!? Um no they fucking sent me home with a drained battery!  I have a one year old and in this heat that is unacceptable.  Maybe a heads up would have been nice. \"Like hey your battery is almost dead. It's not covered after 24 months so you might want to replace it\" nope. Nothing.  I'm so over the excuses. And you know what. Good customer service isn't just talking nice. It's also giving the results you promised. Thanks for paying for my rental though. Fuckers.
