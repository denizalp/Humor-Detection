This was a fantastic little find for me - not knowing where to stay, what areas were good, bad, etc. - the 3 Palms fit my exact needs.   For $81\/night (i think this was a deal) I had an exceptionally clean room, a nice desk space, the shower was fab & the bed & linens definitely won me over.   The free wi-fi in the rooms sucked badly, but once I found out they had a little guest lounge, that worked well for what I needed to do.    I would think though, that if I were traveling on business, and wanted to work from my room, this would be a problem if the wi-fi situation is always this bad.   It appears that this place may have been a former 70's motel, but they certainly did a nice job with the makeover and disguised it well enough for me.   The staff was exceptionally helpful and professional, and the pool \/ grounds were immaculate.    The location was central, but quiet neighboorhood feel.   A nice little fridge, microwave, safe, ironing board, hair dryer, cushy bath robes & coffee pot provided.   Sweet little spot, and I would definitely stay here again.   Contemporary mod attempted design & feel.
