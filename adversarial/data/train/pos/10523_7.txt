It's better than Red Robins at least...\n\nFood is underwhelming in flavor and creativity. \n\nThe Gordon Ramsey brand could learn a lot from much better burger places from the PNW such as; Quinn's, 8oz Burger, and Biwa.\n\nSupposedly they reinvented the milkshake too... Into that jello pudding you buy from the grocery.  \n\nAlso... The French fries were chewy.\n\niPads with a terrible web-based application used as a drink menu offer a very awkward experience. \n\nIf you're a foodie... This is not a place for you.
