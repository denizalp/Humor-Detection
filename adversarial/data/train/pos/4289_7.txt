I read the warnings about lineups so I came prepared to wait, but on a Saturday afternoon there wasn't one. This is a tiny, sparsely decorated dining room (15 people tops) with only a few dozen framed photos artistically arranged along the staircase that leads to what I can only assume are the bathrooms.\n\nI ordered the red curry with squash ($7.95) with tofu instead of chicken or shrimp. It came quickly and was served with a perfect dome of rice. I was saddened by the squash to tofu ratio though. There was way too much tofu (see pic). I know it sounds weird to complain about that but I was hoping for more squash since, you know, that's what it was advertised as. Quite affordable and a LOT of food - I could barely finish half.\n\nThe restaurant is owned by a really sweet guy, his wife and her dad. They told us that they used to own a restaurant in northern Thailand so their menu reflects a more \"northern\" style of cuisine. There are Thai language lessons written up on the menu board that teach you common expressions like \"this is delicious\" and so forth. \n\nNOTE: Don't be a sucker like we were and sit there for ten minutes grumbling that you haven't gotten the bill yet - here you have to go up to the cash register to pay.
