\"Se√±or\" Javier Avila was very arrogant, cocky, condescending, and his estimate was sky high. Don't even think about getting a quote by email, or on paper. Javier is TOO BUSY, \"comprendes\"? Thankfully, there is more than enough competition in this field to hire somebody else. \"Adios Senor\" Javier!!!!
