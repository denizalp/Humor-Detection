Stepped foot in here and wanted to hang myself off the ceiling.\n\nThis place SUCKED!\n\nThese dudes that my friend made us hang out with told us to go here. WE paid the cover charge because the dudes were sooo lame to begin with. Drinks here are comparable to drinking shots out of a toilet filled with piss.\n\nCrowd was mainly desperate looking dudes of all races-- except for asians so me and my friends felt like we were FOBs... eventhough we're american made! yikes.\n\nI'll only step foot into this establishment again if I'm in a dark depressive mood and contemplating suicide. I'll request the dj to shoot me in the face.
