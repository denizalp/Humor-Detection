I LOVE Ghost Adventures and I've been dying to come here! \n\nIt is kind of pricey, but for me the whole tour was SO worth it. There were so many things to look at and yes, there were a couple items that were kind of frightening.\n\nMy biggest regret was seeing Zak outside and NOT asking him for a photo :( I was super shy and it seemed like I was the only one fan-girling over him. We did see him leaving in his truck as we left, but he only waved at us. Sad sad.\n\nI only gave them 4 stars just because I feel like they should have a better system for their tours. It literally felt like you were waiting forever in a line outside (& in the heat nonetheless) to buy tickets and then to go on the actual tour. Maybe they should allow visitors to schedule their tours instead?\n\nAnyways, next time in Vegas, I'm definitely coming back & I WILL get my photo :)
