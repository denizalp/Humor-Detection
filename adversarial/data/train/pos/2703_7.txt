After being a past regular at a different Pho restaurant we decided to try this place.......ummmmm\nOne word sums this place up = BLAND\nEven after getting food poisoning twice from the other place I would still rather eat there.....\nSorry fans....it's bland :(\nIt's loud and they rush you in and out. My side of rice was cold and hard.
