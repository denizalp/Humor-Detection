Overall 3.5 stars.\n\nSurprise find, especially in this neighbourhood.  \n\nLou's is much bigger inside than its exterior suggests.  We ordered a chicken souvlaki and a lamb souvlaki dinner.  Both came with bread, salad and 2 sides of your choice.  Both souvlaki were tender and flavourful.  The funny thing was I right away compared the chicken souvlaki with Zet's chicken souvlaki.  It was just a reflex thinking.  Regret to say Zet's tastes better.  I never have lamb souvlaki at Zet's, so I can't make a comparison.  The salad had too much dressing.  The dressing drown the salad to the point that the flavour was overpowering.  The kitchen could do this fresh vegetable justice by using less dressing.  Kindly note that we got Greek salad without paying an extra $1 for an upgrade.  I wasn't sure if they automatically gave out Greek salad, in that case you should never pay the upgrade fee, or if we were lucky.\n\nServices was friendly, to the point, but nothing more.  It might be because this was a lunch meal.\n\nI really like that Loui's is here to offer an alternative dining option.  I'd love to visit for dinner.
