Took my vacuum here based strictly off the reviews on Yelp! There is a much closer store near my house but the reviews were awful and I didn't want to take any chances of getting pissed off for horrible customer service or dealing with someone trying to get over on me. James was amazing and my Dyson is like new again! It was affordable and if I have any more problems I will drive clear across town to this location.
