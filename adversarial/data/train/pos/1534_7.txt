I had read all the positive reviews and my mother a Henderson resident had been there several times and had an enjoyable experience each time.  Therefore, I had high expectations for this restaurant, unfortunately my experience did not remotely meet those expectations.\n\nService\/Decor were fine 4\/5, but the food was awful.  We ordered the chef's table, so its is supposedly creative dishes that are not on the regular menu. I'll go course by course:\n\n1) Beet Salad w\/ Goat Cheese: Best Dish of the Night 4\/5. but then again something I make at home, so nothing special.\n\nUnfortunately straight down hill from the beet salad.\n\n2)Jerk Chicken drumstick:  Dry, not well seasoned.  I'm spoiled my having a wonderful Dominican restaurant nearby, but this version of jerk chicken if that's what they were attempting was not well executed.  Hole in the wall ma\/pa place 1 DC 0.  1\/5\n\n3) Seared Salmon in a Miso Broth with Shrimp:  A fishy fish like Salmon in a salty brine like miso.  The miso did nothing but serve to accentuate the fishiness of the Salmon, yuck.  I actually sent it back, its the 1st dish I've sent back in years.  I literally couldn't eat the dish it was disgusting.  0\/5\n\nThe salmon dish was replaced with a veal cheek dish, which was technically well prepared, but nothing special 3\/5.\n\n4) Sirloin Steak with Blue Cheese topping:  Steak was a perfect medium rare, but under seasoned.  I'm not a blue cheese fan so I had to scrap that off.  I make a better steak at home and I'm not some super chef, just a competent home cook.  2\/5\n\n5)Chocolate Mousse w\/ Grand Marnier, not a fan of messing with a classic like chocolate mousse.  The addition of Grand Marnier was OK, but I would have preferred the mousse without it.  However, the mousse was thick and gummy.  Mousse should be light airy fluffy melt in your mouth, not something you use to apply postage to a package.  I find it astounding that their desert chef couldn't even get a simple mousse correct.  I love chocolate mousse and didn't finish mine.  1\/5\n\nI'm sorry to be such a downer, but my experience at this restaurant was uniformly terrible and I would not recommend it to anyone.
