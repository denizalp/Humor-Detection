This place has potential for sure, and the people working are very nice,   but nearly 30 minutes to wait for a sandwich and an order of pierogies.  I'd hate to see this place in a lunch rush because we were shoulder to shoulder with 6 people in there.  It's really only \"to go\", as the four bar stools are taken up by people waiting on their orders.\n\nThe bread is delicious, however, there was way too much oil on my steak and pepper \"zepplin\" so the bread was a soggy mess.  Good thing I ate it immediately of I can imagine what the condition of the bread would have been in.  Pierogies were delicious, but soggy with grease.... a little longer frying would have fixed that as one has to expect grease from pierogies.
