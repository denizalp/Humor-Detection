As with its Chinatown location, this place is just delicious. I highly recommend any of the hot buns (go early before they sell out), though many of the cold ones are pretty wonderful too. The bubble tea is ok. The cakes look FANTASTIC, though I have sadly not tried one yet. \n\nThis location is great for poor students looking for quality cheap eats in the neighbourhood. This location is decidedly NOT good if you frequent Le Gym, which is right next to it. If this is the case, I suggest using the other exit so as to resist the inevitable temptation that will occur each and every time you pass this place...
