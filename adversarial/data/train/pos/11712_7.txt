Grab your girlfriends and head to Kyou for a spa-style pampering session! Parking is hard to find in this super-busy Chinatown plaza, so make a day of it with mani-pedis in the morning, grab a meal a few steps away, and finish up with another service like a massage, facial, waxing, or lashes and a drink at the tiki bar to show off your new look! The only thing they don't do in this huge, gorgeous space is hair. \n\nNail services are competitively priced with Asian nail art available. They're still in grand opening mode, so check for discounts on their social media accounts. My mani-pedi from Melissa was a relaxing experience, and her attention to detail was top notch. Bonus points for having hot tea available to up the relaxation during the foot soak. I don't usually take time for myself for beauty treatments, but Kyou is the spot I'll think of - my next visit will be for a deep tissue massage!
