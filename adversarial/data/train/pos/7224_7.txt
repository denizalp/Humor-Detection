I love fish, and I love them raw and wiggling and jumping around fresh.  Not literally though...  I been here like a bazillion times and every time it was an excellent experience.  In my opinion there is only one place that can top Tomo.  Just one.......\n\nSometimes the wait can be long depending on the time of the day and the day of the week you visit.  The food is always fresh and delicious and the price is decent for what you get (been here so many times I probably tried everything).  The restaurant was always clean and their restroom was clean as well.  Service has always been delightful and top notch.  \n\nGreat atmosphere, great place, definitely will come back to get my sushi fix.
