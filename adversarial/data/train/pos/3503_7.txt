Hmmm whiskeys idk. Can a bar be considered obnoxious?? Still salty for dropping 34$ at 50cent beer night. Whatever. This place is the melting pot of state st. Sloshed college students flock to make fools of themselves on sweaty dance floor (guilty). Overly confident guys flock to ride the mechanic bull and end up pulling a muscle. Middle aged weirdo dudes flock to shoot pool and creep on smokes. U better be lit like a homeless man on four lokos if you expect to have a good night at whiskeys\n\n\nEdit: Haley is the best bartender there. Never had a better bartender in my life. You should give her a promotion.
