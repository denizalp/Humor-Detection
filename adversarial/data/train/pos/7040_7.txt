I have eaten at this location more times than I can remember.  I adore the gorgeous setting in Crystals, part of City Center in Vegas and  I love sitting at the opulent marble bar and enjoying a glass of wine.  The bartenders on this particular night were a little busy so we were not getting the service we usually would expect, but it was still good.  We ordered oysters for the appetizer.  As always, fresh and delicious!  The seafood here is consistently fresh and perfectly prepared. I have never had the steak, but people rave about that as well.  Mastros, you never let me down.  Next time I am home, I shall visit you.
