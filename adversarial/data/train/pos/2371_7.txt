I've been hearing great things about Rhino for quite some time now.\n\nThe rave reviews are totally legit! Why, oh, why did I wait so long?\n\nReminded me a bit of the Common Market, but with a bright, airy feel to it.\n\nThe deli here is fantastic! The beer selection is impressive as well! Even a few on tap! Grab a cold one from the fridge, ask for a glass and drink it here if you want!\n\nThe math is simple - Burial Ceremonial IPA + Mango Tango Foxtrot IPA + Zapps Salt and Vinegar chips = heaven... It's like an IPA sandwich with potato filling...\n\nThe Stacked Corned Beef sandwich on rye is a game changer! Sooo freakin' good!\n\nSelections for carnivores and herbivores alike - salads - deli sides - weekday lunch specials and even breakfast served daily!\n\nGo to their website, download their menu and staple it to your forehead so you don't lose it!! Or just fold it up and cram it in your wallet....
