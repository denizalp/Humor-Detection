Nope, never again! If your Tech's can't maintain a professional attitude and complain even before they start the job. To me that is a reflection of poor scheduling. Indicating poor management. Offering another tech service to rectify the first behavior problem is creating another situation for a  possibility for more attitude. Thanks but no thanks.
