As with ALL buffets, they start out good, then slip into meh, or worse.   The first time we tried this place it was nice.  (Buffets are never great, its the nature of doing cafeteria style food)\nThe selections this time were just as vast as the first time we tried them, but alas, the quality is so hit-n-miss that I must pass on this place in the future.  Not only was the food ranging the scale from good to gross across the various dishes, it was also doing so on the same dish.  My first trip through the line I got pot stickers and some really nice sole, after several minutes I returned to finish off with the stuff I knew was good and in just that time, the food quality dropped to... yuck!\nAt $20 a plate, I don't expect it to be Roy's Hawaiian Fusion, (Check that out sometime) but I do expect to be able to get through a meal without wanting to vomit.  (Yes, some things just about got me to that point.)\nLook, I love to experiment with food, nothing scares me, but I do require that if you are going to present me with something new and unusual, you prepare it in the proper way to highlight the ingredient.  Epic fail on many of the dishes here.  Oh and I forgot to mention the sushi that was made from fish so old that it should not have been used for any kind of dish.  I have had pre-packaged stuff from the grocery store that was not as fishy tasting. \nAll in all, I'll spend another $20 a plate and get something awesome.
