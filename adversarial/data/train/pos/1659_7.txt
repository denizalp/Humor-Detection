I love Eggslut! It always hits the spot for breakfast whenever we are in Vegas!\n\nFavorites: Bacon Egg Cheese Sandwich & the Fairfax w Bacon! Yum!\n\nLine is usually shorter than the LA location! Yay!\n\nLocated on the second floor of Cosmo next to the Chandelier Bar... close to Milk & Momofuku...
