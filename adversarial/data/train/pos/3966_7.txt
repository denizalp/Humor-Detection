Large selection, overpriced stock, lack of knowledgeable staff.\nI don't expect the store to have staff that are experts in every craft, but if no one in your store knows if you have a common item in stock, that's a bit frustrating.\n\n I wasn't the only person there who had difficulty finding staff or finding the item they were looking for. Ended up taking my business to the nearby Office Depot, which had my item in stock along with staff to tell me so and direct me to the section of the store. Seems like they probably lose a lot of business due to this, since Walmart is right next door also.\n\nFor non-craft items like d√©cor, there's good selection here but it's really overpriced despite sale signage everywhere. The few items I have been able to find and purchase here (spray adhesive, candles, rubber cement) are about a buck more than elsewhere for no apparent reason.
