Stopped by on their opening day and it was a bit chaotic. They appeared to be having electrical problems with the lighting so because an electrician kept having to move from one ceiling tile to another to fix a problem.\n\nNeedless to say, that a problem that will go away in short order.\n\nI ordered the Smoke House Burger with a side of fries.  For this trip, I only ordered the single because I had had a big lunch but this was more than a meal.  Good textures and great taste cooked just the way I like it.  The fries area some of the best I have had in the Mooresville area.\n\nThere was a lot of confusion among the counter staff about how to ring up my order and they forgot to give me my numbered tent for serving.  They found me anyway.\n\nHopefully this is a glitch that will go away with time and training. This is the only reason I did not rate them higher.\n\nOne point is that the inside almost has a sterile atmosphere with a stark contrast of Red and  White.  Something needs to be done to make it warmer.\n\nAnother point is that this is the only Johnny's Rocket's I've been to with a drive through.\n\nBill
