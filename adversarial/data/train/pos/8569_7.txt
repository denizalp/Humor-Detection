This place is more of an icon than anything else.  No longer an attractive property, the Forum shops, dining, and poker are about the only things worth doing here anymore.  The casino is now too smoky, too crowded, and frankly, too damn old.  Time to make a new property if possible.\n\nWe came here to eat at Rao's - and ran into one of the most inadvertent racists we've seen in a while.  An old security guard was attempting to be helpful but ended up having my brother and I wanting to kick his geriatric ass after his multiple oriental comments and how us \"orientals\" would love the shopping and new noodle bar.  Fortunately for him, I'm too smart to tangle with an employee and have Vinny and Pussy come out to drag me away.\n\nNah, I'll steer clear of here.
