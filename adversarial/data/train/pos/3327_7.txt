This my absolute favorite and best all you can eat sushi restaurant by far. \nEverything was just perfect! I suggest you get your money's worth and skip out on the rolls or just get a couple. Go for the Nigiris instead!\n\nThe ama ebi (sweet shrimp) was my utmost favorite (unfortunately that and the uni you're limited to two orders), the salmon of course, hamachi, tuna, tamago, unlimited seaweed salad, unique variety of rolls and the fact that you can half it, the soup with the shrimp head, the fried shrimp head, pork belly, hand rolls, amazing desserts: yozu sorbet, greentea creme brûlée, mochi ice cream, tempura ice cream, lychee sorbet. \n\nUgh I cant even write about this place without getting sad that I can't eat it anytime soon. The fact that I didn't get a chance to take pictures of the food at the time because we were starving after a long wait so we all jus dug in doesnt help either because I can't remember everything we ate. My party and I got so many orders of so many different items that night we were feeling super stuffed by the end of dinner. \n\nI'm pretty sure you can't order anything wrong in this place so if your stomach can handle it, try a little of everything !\n\nThe service is great, they are always extremely patient, and came by quite often to check on us. There was a long wait but it was most certainly worth it. The price is amazing for all the food that was and could be eaten.\n\nCan't wait to come back here again to feast!!!
