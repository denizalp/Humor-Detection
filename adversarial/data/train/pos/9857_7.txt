I would have to disagree with Jen B. , I felt everything was priced rather correctly and they have quite a few specials. The place was a pretty typical sports bar in terms of decor and atmosphere. \n\nI had the shrimp basket with fries for $7 ( a special). The fries were super delicious and the shrimp was really crispy (plus they took off the tails : ) ) . I wasn't fond of their cocktail sauce at all, but overall my meal was tasty.\n\nMy reason for the -2 stars was our server...who was a tad on the clueless side. I asked for a Magic Hat, but she had no idea what I was referring to until I said number 9 which is fine though they only have 5 or 6 beers on tap. My friend and I asked twice for waters - she managed to get the two men in the group their drink orders just fine. We sat and watched the servers chit-chat while our meal sat in the window, and finally another server was kind enough to bring it over to us. Our server didn't get the two ladies orders correct (forgot condiments and what not), but again managed to get the men in our group exactly what they wanted\/needed in a timely fashion. \n\nIf I head to Sweetwater again I'd probably be sure to ask for a different server, though I was all around happy with my food.
