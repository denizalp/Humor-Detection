Where to start with this RAG, \"The Arizona Repulsive\" ??\n\nThey are the worst example of an alleged newspaper.  The Accounting practices are the worst, including FRAUD by the accounting department.  Yes, FRAUD.  When confronted with that, they never denied it.\n\nIf you don't get a paper today, you will NOT get it today... tomorrow \"IF\" you are lucky.\n\nALL employees in the \"Customer NO Service\" department are outright liars.  Every stinking one of them.  In one phone call, if you speak to  several people, you will get a different answer from each and everyone of them.  Call back, same subject, same runaround, different lies.  Guaranteed !\n\nAnother thing, their alleged \"New\" website is a 100% rip-off of the USA Today !!  How easy that was, \"New and Improved\", sure.\n\nAfter you cancel, if you are lucky enough for someone to get that, they will sell your name and phone number to telemarketers.  Now, you are faced with getting rid of them.\n\nDon't waste your time and precious money on this bird cage liner.\n\nActually their score should be minus 10 or worse..
