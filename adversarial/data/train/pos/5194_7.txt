Just had Jack come out and spend the whole day fumbling around cutting holes in the drywall playing Marco Polo looking for a pipe that he was certain was the source or at least the main culprit for my massive 55000 gallons a month water loss. After fumbling around for about 4 hours finally I told him to call his supervisor since his next suggestion was cutting holes in the sheetrock in the laundry room to go continue searching for a faulty pipe. His Manager arrived and quickly discovered that one of the valves was not turned on or off and quickly located the pipe Jack was looking for in a matter of minutes without cutting holes throughout my house. After this the job that Jack started was completed in about an hour and change. Unfortunately once they cut the water back on the exact amount of water loss was still pumping somewhere into the ground on my property suggesting that the job they just spent the whole day on was not in fact the source of the leak. The first thing out of his mouth was maybe there's multiple leaks. Problem is I'm not paying $2,000 on maybes. When you pay the extraordinary high-priced fees for plumbers you expect them to know what the heck they are doing and diagnose the problems accordingly. After stumbling around in my backyard he looked at a water faucet and said that can't be the problem, maybe you should call a pool guy. I'm having another plumbing company come out to do an assessment meanwhile my garage sheetrock walls have been torn out and my problem  still exist. Their manager Jeff did offer to pay for the sheetrock repair due to the massive delays in the morning costing me money for not being able to go to work. I will update as this progresses.
