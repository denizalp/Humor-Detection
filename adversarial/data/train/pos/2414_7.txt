My experience with the Service Dept has always been great. I take advantage of their coupons that save on oil changes and repairs. I have found the service advisors to be super courteous and helpful. \n\nABC technicians do an excellent inspection so you get informed about the repairs needing attention. One visit uncovered a number of expensive repairs that ended up costing me zero due to being under warranty. Appreciated my service advisors help with that.\n\nIn my experience ABC Nissans service dept is way superior to other dealers.
