Assad Bakery is one of the many great resources for Middle Eastern cuisine here on the west side. It is like our own Gaza Strip right here on Lorain Ave. I usually go to Al Manar for a quick pick up of hummus or tabouli. I am friends with a couple of the dudes that work there from back in the day. So customer service at Al Manar has not been an issue. It has for some others. The service at Assad's is fantastic even with no personal connections or prior shopping experiences. I was referred to as \"habibi\" which is always a great greeting. I didn't even need to throw a couple Arabic words out there to show I'm down. The hummus at Assad's reminds me of the family recipes of friends. It has a more grainy texture and not as smooth or tahini infused as my favorite (Nate's). The hot pepper sauce and olive oil is a great topper and definitely should be asked for. The grape leaves are fresh and delicious as well. The tabouli is also slightly different here when compared to many local spots. It is not as citrus-y but more minty and herbal. They have the typical \"street meats\" as well on rotating spits along with Middle Eastern groceries. I cannot wait to make my way back to Assad's.
