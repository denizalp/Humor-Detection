5 off with foursquare check in at total rewards desk which is a great deal!\n\nThe moules and other seafood was good. I didn't particularly enjoy the prime rib or tri tip. Fish was cooked well but make sure you stay away from the salads! It got my boyfriends dad really sick and ruined the rest of our trip. He threw it up that night and no more buffets in the land of buffets.\n\nThe macarons looked good but were stale.\n\nThe crepes are cooked to order and the #1 Monkey crepe was excellent! Banana, Nutella and chocolate. For $30, you could probably eat at a better buffet.
