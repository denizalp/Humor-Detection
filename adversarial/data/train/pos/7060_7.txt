Yelp's 365 Review Challenge 2014 #141 - #365\n\nIt was my last day at the Mirage and I wanted to finish it with a BANG! So why not eat at one of the Mirage's restaurants, I decided on dining in Carnegie Deli right by the Race and Sports Book and CPK. It feels like you're dining in a New York deli and designed as an authentic deli restaurant with Vegas strip pricing. \n\nI ordered the Roast Beef Sandwich and that was humungous. I shared half of it with my friend and she couldn't finish it! Originally I was thinking of ordering the corn beef sandwich but it was just too massive to finish and a total diet killer! \n\nService was over the top and and didn't disappoint. In fact our server was checking in on us even though he was slammed with customers and that is a multi tasking skill that every server should have. Food was delicious and couldn't fault on anything. It nice trying out Carnegie Deli but I'll just stick to BLT Burger just right around the corner.
