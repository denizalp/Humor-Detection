Great customer service! All I have to say is Raymond was awesome! \n\nFrom the time he helped me check in my bag to the actual boarding of the plane, he made my Virgin America airport experience wonderful. I have to admit, I was a little buzzed from drinking and he handled my demanding spoiled brattiness with perfect aplomb.\n\nI wish more airlines had such fun and attentive employees like him!
