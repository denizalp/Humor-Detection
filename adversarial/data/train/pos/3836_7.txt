Okay let me start by saying holy wontons are huge and good. Perfect broth . The noddles where cooked perfect not soggy.\nThere wait staff is great super fast this place has a great turn over .  \nPlace is very clean . They also have the best chilli sauce that you add to your own soup.\nThere prices are low but the portions are large. This might be the best deal in Mississauga.
