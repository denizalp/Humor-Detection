Now playing: Skrillex - Ghost n Stuff\n\nJust kidding. I think I heard Mexican polka music while walking in but I love it. \n\nWe came during opening week and everything went pretty smoothly. We didn't have to wait long for good or drinks and we were really happy with our dinner. The interior was carefully thought out and I liked all the southwestern touches.\n\nWe had ordered quite a bit. To drink we had a cold brew Press Coffee, a Prickly Pear Sparkler, and a Happy Hour Prickly Pear Rosé 'Rita. Joyce W. isn't a fan of tequila but she loves rosé so it kept her chatty all throughout dinner. After dinner though, she fell into a food coma. She crashed out on the couch as soon as she touched the cushion -- high compliments to the chef!\n\nFor eats we shared the Ceviche and a bowl of Pumpkin Soup. The Ceviche was good and I pretty much ate the whole thing. But the soup was amazing. I battled with the wife for the last bite. She won because she's a maniac with a spoon. ;) I had the Green Chile Burger which didn't have too much green chile in it. The cook was a bit more medium-well than I liked but it was still good. I was jealous of the wife's Cowboy Steak which had her ooh-ing and ahh-ing when it came to the table. Lucky me when she gave me three or four slices of this giant prime ribeye and she even cut it up for me. It was dang good even though it was medium and not medium-rare.\n\nI really like this place. The bill was a little under $88, before tip. I think the steak, two appetizers, and some drinks would have been enough for us and I would like to try their brunch. All in all, what a great addition to the Tempe restaurant scene. Aaron Chamberlain has done it again!
