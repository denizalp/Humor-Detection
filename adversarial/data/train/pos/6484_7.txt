My first experience with Five Guys - As a burger connoisseur I really don't know what took me so long to do . Furthermore, I don't know how anyone can possibly slag this place. Chain or not, they put out a fantastic product in a super fun way.\n\nThink 1950s\/60s burger bar focused on the basics and doing them really well with a hyper-focus on customer service. A smaller menu consisting of a burger, cheese burger, bacon cheeseburger, fries and drinks - that's IT! Some would say unoriginal, I say specialists. \n\nEach burger is cooked perfectly and you can add any or all the toppings they offer for FREE. What I really found remarkable was they have a white board sign near the cash registers which tells you where their farm fresh potatoes are coming from - in a way connecting you to the farmers - very cool!\n\nAnd as I mentioned earlier, they serve those well done menu items with a big smile and a ton of follow up. In my time waiting I had numerous team members ask me questions to check if I was ok, what number order I was (then letting me know what I already knew - 2, 3, 4, more until my turn (the affirmation while redundant was oddly reassuring, letting me know I hadn't been forgotten about in the busy fray of the lunch rush) and if there was anything else they could do or get me while I waited. Then once I was eating someone walked around and just checked-in, to see if everything was ok! \n\nWonderful\n\nAnd heck, if you're feeling hangry, they've got FREE peanuts while you wait so you can self serve.\n\nGood burgers, Great service. Now, available all over the GTA!\n\nEatcrest Out!
