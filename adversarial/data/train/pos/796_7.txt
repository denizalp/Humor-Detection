Possibly the best thing about the Vegas library system is the online facility for requesting books and DVDs for pickup at the location of your choosing. \n\nLooking at my zip code, the system selects West Charleston as my default branch.  When I request an item, I have to remember to change the location to Sahara West.\n\nI first started going to West Charleston when it was a clean, modern facility perched on the edge of a good-sized expanse of open desert.  The junior college campus was just a nightmare waiting to happen. Visiting this branch was enjoyable.  It was practically new, never crowded, and very quiet.\n\nThose days are over.  It's always busy and noisy.  It has been allowed to get run down and dirty. Parking is a pain. Ingress\/egress is awful.  It's never fun coming here.   \n\nLuckily the Sahara West library isn't too far away.  I think gas would have to go to $6 a gallon before I'd become concerned about burning the extra gas.\n\nWhen I request anything (book or movie) from the library, I'm always surprised that they have it.  For example, the 1999 Albert Brooks movie \"The Muse.\"  They don't have it. How about \"La Dolce Vita,\" one of the all-time classics? They can't be bothered. They're too busy making a major purchase of \"You Don't Mess With Zohan.\" \n\nAnd you call yourselves a LIBRARY?\n\nThe library's misguided policy of buying 100 copies of a dopey movie like \"How to Lose a Guy in Ten Days\" but zero copies of something worthwhile like \"Never Cry Wolf\" can frustrate users like me who have interests beyond smash hits.  Why not just ONE copy of Never Cry Wolf for crackpots like me? Can't the library accommodate a few misfits who like obscure but excellent movies?\n\nSure, it takes extra effort to go deeper than the best-seller lists, but shouldn't the library be more than a free Netflix? Doesn't cultural enrichment figure in somewhere?\n\nI asked a librarian about it.  He said the chances that the library will buy a movie like Never Cry Wolf are practically nil.  There is no demand for a movie about a guy who lives among wolves.\n\nFor what it's worth, you can use the online facility to suggest a library purchase.  Since they only buy hit movies, I guess you can ask for a popular movie they somehow overlooked.\n\nI sent them an email to complain but of course they didn't reply.  \n\nFYI here's the IMDB listing for Never Cry Wolf. http:\/\/www.imdb.com\/title\/tt0086005\/\n\nPEOPLE: ZERO STARS\nDVDs on loan from the library is a wonderful free service.  Leave it to our fellow humans to abuse it.  Somehow your fellow library patrons find a way to damage and destroy DVDs.  How does a DVD get destroyed when all that is involved is taking it home, removing it from the case, playing it, and returning it to the case?\n\nMy guess is these swine let their kids play with the DVDs.  They probably have to retrieve the discs from the toy chest before returning them.\n\nYes, you will have the disappointment of enjoying a movie only to have it freeze in the middle because some ignorant scumbag has destroyed it.
