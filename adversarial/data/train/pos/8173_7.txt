Yes, I went somewhere else besides my regular spot (Good Foot), but only because my favorite lady was not available down the street. Plus, sometimes you need to sample the rest to make sure you've found the best.\n\nI will say that Royal Foot has a nice pad. It is clean and spacious, and several of their rooms are actual rooms with a door that closes, unlike other spots that only have curtains of some variety. However, the ceilings are very tall, which made me feel like I was getting a foot massage in a warehouse -- not a great feeling. They do accept credit cards, which is a bonus.\n\nAs for the quality of the foot massage, I think it would have been pretty dang nice if my husband hadn't swiped my masseuse 1\/3 of the way into the deal. Yep, that's right: he stole my lady! I was having a nice massage, when I hear my husband tell his masseuse that she can apply more pressure. Well, apparently my lady was the strong one, and when she heard this, she decided she should take over my husband's massage. The lady I inherited was okay, but I got the feeling that she was just going through the motions without a real commitment. If you've gotten foot massages before, you probably know what I am talking about. It feels a little haphazard. It was okay. \n\nTrust me. I gave my husband crap for stealing my foot massage. According to him, his was great! Figures. I am giving him 1-star. Royal Foot, I am going to give you 2.5 because when I think about it, I probably would try another new place before returning.  Of course, my husband might think differently.
