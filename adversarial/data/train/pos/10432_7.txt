My husband and I tried this restaurant for the first time last night. We just saw it on Restaurant Impossible a few nights ago and needed a place to eat before hitting the theater. As soon as we got out of the truck I was scared. It smelled SO bad, like a sewer smell. \n\nOnce inside the noise was almost unbearable. Maria came over and said she would clean a table for us. The place is very small inside. She grabbed a rag and wiped the table. When we got to the table my chair had food all over it, and it looked like the floor had not been cleaned as there was food all over. Nowhere to put my purse except on the floor...yes, on the food!\n\nThe waitress came over and told us they were out of the specials so she wouldn't waste our time telling us what they were. It was a Friday night at 6:45 pm and they're already out of the specials??\n\nI ordered a lemonade. It smelled funky and when I tried it, it tasted like dirty water. Had my husband taste it just to be sure. Traded that for a soft drink. \n\nI ordered the chicken parm. Not too bad. Veggies smelled and tasted horrible!!  Like burned plastic. Had hubby try too and yep, they were gross. He ordered veal parm. It was rubbery and over cooked. He thinks they used lemon juice on it which gave it a bitter taste. \n\nEven when the restaurant emptied a bit, we were yelling at each other to be heard. Way too loud!!\n\nAll in all it was a huge disappointment. We will not be back.
