This is a comfortable, clean Thai restaurant. It is nicely decorated and here you can have reasonably priced authentic Thai food. They have a drive thru take out at this location, but it works very slow((( They have a good selection and a large variety of Thai food, that is tasty and beautifully plated. The service is good and friendly. They explain the food in case that you're not familiar to the dishes. Once I asked for more chili sauce and they brought an excellent assortment of spicy sauces. There are always Asians eating here which is a good sign I think.  \nIf you love unordinary and spicy food, you'll like this place for sure.
