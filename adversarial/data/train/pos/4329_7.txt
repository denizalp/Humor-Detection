I got the Bun Bo Hue. The portion was big, like any other Vietnamese restaurant. The meat in the soup was very very x3 hard. The beef slices were so hard that I couldn't eat chew on it. It was also dry and dark colored. I'm very sure it's old beef. Leftover beef and cooked again or something. It was honestly so hard that I'm a little scared now lol. They give you a lot of the meat, but then it just went to waste because I couldn't even eat it at all. I do like how they give you a lot of pork blood cubes, which are my favorite part of the dish. I felt like the broth needed more flavor to it. I had to put like two table spoons of fish sauce to the soup, which I normally do not. Maybe the soup just needed to be cooked longer so the flavor can build up. They had a $10 card minimum.
