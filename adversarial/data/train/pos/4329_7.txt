I found a new 2014 Versa Note advertised on their website and when I made the drive to the dealership it was actually there! And for the advertised price! No shady business here! I worked with Saul Sanchez and he made the process easy. I really appreciated it as this was the first car I've purchased for myself and I had been to several other extremely aggressive dealerships in the last month and was getting sick of the whole thing. Would highly recommend.
