5 stars all the way!  This is seriously simple, amazing and cheap pizza. You literally have to look twice to find the spot. They don't even have an illuminated sign anymore, so look twice. \n\nThis is the epitome of old school pizzeria. There's a mountain of pizza boxes, a beautiful espresso machine, a fridge full of Brio and a cash register that rang in the first purchase of the Gutenberg Bible. People have commented on the owner being grumpy but I think it's more that he's concentrated on putting out quality product. \n\nThe product is a thing of beauty. The perfect blend of crust that is firm and the right amount of char, yet can support a mountain of bubbly cheese without becoming a grease napkin (see Mama's Pizza).  \n\nThis is also a highly addictive product, as you can easily gorge an entire pizza in one sitting. Makes excellent leftovers the next day, if there's any left. I'd recommend the Hawaiian with bacon.
