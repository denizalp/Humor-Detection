I thought the food was very good! Especially since just moving from LA it tasted very authentic! They have huge portions and I was able to take home a lot of left overs. The service was good and the food came out very fast.\n\nI think it was a little pricey but that's my only complaint. I was able to order off of the vegetarian portion of the menu which was a little cheaper. Very yummy salsa and chips too! Worth checking out if you're craving Mexican food :)
