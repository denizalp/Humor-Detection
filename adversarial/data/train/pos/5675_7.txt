This review is going to be short and sweet, well, not so sweet for the Steelers. I think when the city decided to build the Steelers a new stadium, instead of building another Arrowhead Stadium like in Kansas City, they should have built a stadium that would have been a Mecca to the greatest football team in the NFL. Instead, we have a drafty stadium, with a lousy field, and really awful yellow seats. Not even a sit down restaurant.\n\nWhen I look at what they built in Detroit, Dallas, and Phoenix, I could just spit at what we got.\n\nHey, Dan Rooney, when your finished being Ambassador to Ireland, go take in a baseball game at PNC Park and see what a GREAT stadium looks like.
