Two words: Fat Mac. I get why Mac was eating Chimichangas so much. Before coming to Julio's I never had Chimichangas, and wow, I totes get why Mac had them all the time. They are delicious, along with every single thing on the Julio's menu.\n\nThe people there are the polite incarnate. They would probably have a funeral for a bird or something. Probably one they don't even know like a raven, or even a pigeon - the rats of the sky. More importantly, whenever I go to have Julio's I have such a good time with their food. The first time I went with a real homie and I got the \"Pollo Magnifico.\" Good doesn't quite capture it. My heart skipped so many beats I developed a heart murmur. \n\nIt has a bit of a retro vibe too. It's like if Pulp Fiction was shot within a Mexican restaurant in Scottsdale flair. Except for the busier times, say the weekends, you can always get a seat and your food quite fast. \n\nEvery other time after that was a bad experience, not because of Julio's, they were always perfect, but because I tried to introduce possible love interests to this place. I guess there were other things going on that made those relationships not work, but the fait accompli in my mind was that they didn't like Julio's. I mean just because we had dinner somewhere else before why can't you get another snack? You gotta always have room for Julio's.\n\nThrough breakups, the woes of relationships, and the bliss of love, Julio's is gonna have your back and always be delish. Stay up fam. Get in there and get a Chimichanga.
