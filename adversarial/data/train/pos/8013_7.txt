3 1\/2\n\nI like the Buck Hunt, super-sized hard core mixed drinks, friendly bartenders, cheapness, backyard for smokers, and with a big group of people you can pretty much take over this place. Also-snackies! \n\nNot so sure I like the over-the-top (OTT) shady characters here-one guy was quite enamoured of me-and there were some others that I cannot even bear to type out or it will make them real and not a figment of my late night drunk imagination. Also, those drinks made a friend smack me-in a good way, but DAMN-that shit never happened at Caseys.\n\nNot sure how to describe the inside, but I wouldnt want one of those black light DNA sabers in here....uh uh, NO WAY.
