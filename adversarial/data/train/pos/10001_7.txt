Where should I start? Well I guess the beginning would be nice. As we walked in, we were greeted immediately. I am one who appreciates and values great customer service. After being asked how many in our party, we were taken to our seats. As we were seated, our waitress asked us what she could get for us to drink. After ordering our drinks all our wonderful side dishes started arriving immediately. Wonderful, beautiful and delicious banchan!!! My husband and I decided on the 2 persons beef and pork meal. Which came with a side of vegetable skewer, cheese fondue, gyeran Jjim (steamed egg), and a choice of soup. Which my husband and I decided on doenjang-Jjigae (Korean soy bean stew)... absolutely delicious! Then our waitress fired up the grill and the next think I knew, she came out with a wonderful beautiful plate of beef brisket. This plate was gorgeous! You could see the beautiful marbles of fat through out the meat. Grilled to perfection dipped in some wonderful sauces made my mouth very happy!! As soon as we were finishing up our brisket, our waitress started on our next plate of meat. Rib fingers, can we say OMG!! First time ever having these (never even knew they existed). Next round was our beef belly (delicious also). Boneless short rib was next on the agenda and we finished off with the pork bulgogi. We were in meat heaven! If I could give this place more stars, I would. Needless to say, we will definitely be back (soon)!
