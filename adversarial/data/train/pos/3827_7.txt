This is the kind of place that I really want to like as it fits my style of casual eating. I was brought here by a Venezuelan friend, but, unfortunately I really didn't think the food was good. Perhaps I don't like the cuisine, but I really thought there were many flaws.\n\nI had a dish that had a bit of everything, since that's what my friend recommended. The main protein was beef. It was sooooo overcooked. I understand that's how they traditionally cook it, but it really destroys a nice cut of meat. The portion was large, but it was mostly rice and beans. The whole thing was also really greasy. My wife was also unhappy about her meal.\n\nAgain, I wish I could say better things, but La Taguara was not for me.
