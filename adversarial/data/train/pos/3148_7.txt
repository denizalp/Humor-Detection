Fail. Both times. I love the idea behind the restaurant as I've recently tried to be more health conscious with my eating habits, but unfortunately Lyfe Kitchen has disappointed both times I've tried it. \n\nThe first time, I ordered their chicken breast with brussels sprouts. Sadly the chicken was SO bland; it was horribly underwhelming. However the brussels sprouts saved the dish and were the only things on the plate that I ended up eating. \n\nI went into the second visit optimistic that I would have a better experience. This time, due to time constraints, we opted to take our order to go. The Spicy Vietnamese Lettuce Wraps sounded like a sure thing: beefless tips, crispy lettuce, and Thai basil...it sounded as if it would be \"The Redeemer\". To my utter disappointment, when I got home I learned that they packaged the \"crispy lettuce\" already served with the beefless mix atop of it, thus the wraps were soggy and depressing. I mean really, who packages lettuce wraps togo already assembled? I would highly suggest that they rethink this tactic. The actual beefless mix was much tastier than the chicken, but the integrity of the dish was ruined for me due to the soggy lettuce. It wasn't a wrap, it was a dud. \n\nIt saddens me that I was disappointed yet again. The ambience is welcoming and the descriptions of the food sound appetizing, but unfortunately in my experiences they fell short of my expectations. I still would encourage you to try it for yourself, perhaps whatever you order will be more satisfying?! I probably won't be giving this place another try, but I suppose I should never say never.
