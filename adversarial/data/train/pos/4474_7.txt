This place is my best friend's addiction. It's right by his house, which adds to the non-problem, but yeah. I personally think it's good but not something that I need. The food is good, definitely great for hangovers, but just not my favorite. \nThe first time I came I got the chicken parmigiana sandwich, and it was pretty delicious. I have stolen bits of my friends' cheesesteak fries, which are excellent. I have also gotten the garlic parm cheesesteak, which was ok, a little heavy on the garlic, but the steak was tasty. I think I was sad because I wanted the gooey cheese whiz, but whatever. Nice people working in here, convenient location and fairly priced food. But the real thing here.... :\n*THE FRIES ARE THE BEST FRIES I HAVE EVER HAD IN MY LIFE!* Do not come here without getting some fries on the side. Your life will change. They're crispy and seasoned perfectly. So amazing. I can't eat other fries anymore. Come check it out! I've never been to Philly but the food here makes me wanna go. :)
