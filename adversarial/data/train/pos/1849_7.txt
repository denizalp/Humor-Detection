-Store sign falls on a customer with the Store Manager and his two giggling minions just a few feet away. They continue chatting and laughing. Very professional, huh?\n\n-The incident is pointed out to the Store Manager and he shrugs it off. Why is this guy a Store Manager I wonder????\n\n-During a previous visit, there was obvious tension between TWO MOD (manager on duty). I speculate that they think they are invisible or that customers don't notice this ongoing drama at this location.\n\n-My point is that the store manager sets the tone to the store environment {ie - neat store, friendly employees, service, etc.} and this one needs a NEW Store Manager. There are many other grocery store choices, I wouldn't bother stopping here again regardless of the prices, location, etc.
