I don't mind spending a butt load on over priced snacks, but when you give me cold stale popcorn we have a problem. Idk if the Palms lack of business causes them to not care anymore or what but that's just unacceptable. Make some damn fresh popcorn and don't serve your customers old garbage!\n\nGet a grip management, this is why no one patronizes this place anymore!
