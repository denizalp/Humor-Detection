Yes a dive bar.  Dirty dirty dirty dive bar. Time to dust your crown royal bottle collection and clean your air vents people! Bartenders were nice even though they never asked how my uneaten food was they just kept asking if I wanted a box for my dried out tough freezer burnt chicken wings. I finally after the third question about a box is when I explained why I wasn't eating and didn't want a box. So 45 minutes after the food was delivered and they realized why now they want to be helpful. BTW there were 5 people in the bar at the time.
