Even if the raw vegan lifestyle isn't for you, the food here is fresh, fun, great tasting, and good for you! Plus it's the best kind of takeout ever, since you don't have to worry about it getting cold. ;)\n\nThere are \"raw\" and just vegan items available- the raw burgers (portabello on nut patty!) and collard wraps (mexican and italian-style!) are my favorites though, both served with avocado \"fries\". If you want a liquid lunch, they have a massive selection of smoothies and shakes, as well as fresh young coconuts.\n\nLocation is a bit odd: you cash out at the hostess stand rather than the back bakery counter or the large ground counter where the staff sit. There's a huge salad bar ($9\/lb) in the middle of the dining room with a small supplement shop area to the right, and the \"small talk garden\" area to the back. There's just a lot going on and not much in the way of decor. I guess all their focus and energy are busy in the kitchen!
