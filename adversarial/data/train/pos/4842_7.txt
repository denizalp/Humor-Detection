I've tried every smoothie on the menu (except durian) in addition to some of their specialty drinks. Here is in order from top to bottom which I enjoyed most: \n1. Watermelon smoothie: not overly sweet, and very good refreshing flavor. Add honey boba to this!\n\n2. Green tea smoothie: much less sweet than Starbucks green tea frappachino, they use good quality green tea which I like.  Add honey boba to this!\n\n3. Sea salt iced coffee drinks. \n\n4. Any of their specialty drinks are refreshing and have unique textures. Here are a few of my favs: Paradise, Summer Cold, House cocktail. \n\n5. Honey dew smoothie: reminds me of melona bars that I used to find in Hawaii. This is fruity yet creamy and not overly sweet. Add honey boba!\n\n6. Mango smoothie: this is my mom's fav. Very fruity flavor, not overly sweet. Add honey boba!\n\n7. Strawberry or strawberry banana smoothie: my Dad's fav. Fruity, refreshing, not too sweet. Similar to Jamba Juice smoothie. Add honey boba! \n\n8. Lychee smoothie with grass jelly: slightly overly sweet but the grass jelly gives it a good balance of flavors and texture \n\n9. Pineapple smoothie: if you enjoy pineapple this is a great fruity, healthy tasting smoothie.\n\n10: passionfruit smoothie: very fresh, sweet tasting drink. Add popping boba, honey boba, or jellies to this one! Get the small though cause it's pretty sugary. \n\nHere are honest reviews of ones I didn't like as much: \n1. Avocado smoothie: tastes exactly like plain avocado, no dimension to the flavor. No sweetness, just straight avocado. Wish they added more creaminess and maybe sugar \n\n2. Taro smoothie: again straight taro flavor, not enough sweetness. I know many reviewers like this one though.. I just really couldn't drink the whole cup. Not a refreshing taste \n\n3. Papaya smoothie: strange aftertaste, almost like a licorice or way overripe taste. Did not enjoy \n\n4. Kiwi smoothie: too bitter. And overly sweet for me \n\nThe honey boba have the best texture in Arizona and I like the variety of drinks. I'll try some of their milk teas next time.
