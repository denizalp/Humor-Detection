If you want a re-live your glory days in a 1980's sports bar, or if you simply want to cry in your beer... (maybe you missed that might-of-won-the high-school football game pass), this is the place.  At Legends, the decor is distinctly out of date, and it seems like one can scrape the nicotine - or grease - off the tables, wood paneling, and brass\/chrome rails.\n\nThe beer is terrible, standard fare mass-brewery sugar pop (Molson's Labbatt's).  It will leave you with a hangover that only a gun will resolve.\n\nFor years I lived in St. Clair and Bathurst, and I never understood why this area is limited to such a bar.
