Ok we came Herr because they're was a bunch of positive reviews but our experience want that great. The staff was friendly, knowledgeable and polite. But the food wasn't worth the money at all. There sushi was small, barely any rice and liked like it was made for my 3 year old. I ordered the rib eye, medium. It came well done and was tasteless. My husband ordered the Saba. Again the portion was itty bitty. The tempura was oily. The tiger roll, holy tell them to hold the sauce, our was swimming in the eel sauce. Thanks but no thanks, we won't be back, sorry.
