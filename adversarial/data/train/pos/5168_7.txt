I purchased tires from a wholesaler and needed them installed on my car. Brought them into NTB at 11 am for an install. The new tires are in the back of my car. No big deal right : ) . 80 bucks for the installation when all said and done. A little pricey but whatever. Install might take longer than expected because I didn't have an appointment. Sure, fair enough. \n\n4:50pm. I get a call from NTB letting me know my tires are installed and that I need an alignment on them as well. $170 for everything. Shoot, a lot more than what I figured but sure, go ahead. I make pretty good money. And THANK GOD a unicorn wasn't stuck in my muffler, THAT would have been expensive. \n\n5:05pm. I get another call letting me know everything went according to plan. Cool! That alignment happened very fast, they probably didn't even do it. But hey! New tires on! Who can complain. Come on Cleveland snow, what you got?\n\nBUT, here comes the plot twist. I hope you are ready. Get a ride BACK to NTB to pick up my car. Walk up to my car.... Here's the kicker. PLOT TWIST! My car HADN'T BEEN MOVED! My old tires were STILL ON!!\n\nSAY WHAT!! Oh no you did'n!\n\nI go in and try to determine why I was going to be charged 170... I lost my cool a bit, rightfully so? Probably not. Then they try driving my car into the garage to install said tires. Poor car was just now given some attention. *Tear*. I demand they return my car and don't even bother with it; a bit aggressively I must admit. They also had the nerve to tell me they performed an alignment! Oh really?  You guys probably filed my tax returns for 2014 too, right?\n\nAll said and done, 6 hours of my life gone and 3 trips to NTB. Thanks NTB! \n\nMoral of the story, lease a car because... MECHANICS. : )
