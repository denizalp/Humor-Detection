The Neon Museum is located off Las Vegas Blvd. north of Fremont Street.  The museum is a collection of Las Vegas signs from the 1930's to our present day.  The signs have been preserved and are on display at two locations both named the Neon Boneyard.  The main boneyard is located near the visitor's center.  The staff refers to the boneyard closest to Cashman Center as the north boneyard.  To see the entire Neon Boneyard, you will have to go one of the guided tours.  I've been here multiple times and only witnessed the signs from their free tours.   I recommend visiting the Neon Museum at the night, so you can witness some of the signs in action.  \n\nThe Neon Museum is a non-profit organization.  It still cost the museum money to light up the signs and pay for maintenance.  That being said, not every sign is going to be up and running.  My advice is to check out the visitor's center first (i.e. the gift shop).  Located inside the visitor's center is a few books and photos of Vegas from back in the day.  See what Vegas used to look like, then check out the signs for yourself.  Pretty cool stuff!  Give the Neon Museum a visit the next time you're in the area.  A visit may just be the highLIGHT of your evening.
