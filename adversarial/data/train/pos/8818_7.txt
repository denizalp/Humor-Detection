Well been told by a friend at work about this local community Chinese restaurant and was impressed the first few visits. \n\nSmall restaurant with a few traditional Chinese round tables and bunch of 4 seat tables.\n\nService is good and friendly. Families are welcome and menu has combos and single items to order. \n\nHave to order Egg Roll as they are delicious and something not served anymore as spring rolls are the rage. \n\nPortions are decent not large by any means. Not as consistent in terms of  taste since my first visit last October 2014. \n\nIt is westernize Chinese but one of SE better choices.
