Stumptown has arrived in Las Vegas!\n\nIf you're a fan of that particular coffee line, Coffee Hunter is the place for you.  \nHere you can get Hairbender espresso, Nitro cold brew, lattes, Americanos, macchiatos, cappuccinos, mochas, pour overs, all made with Stumptown coffee.  In addition, Coffee Hunter offers Metolius teas if you prefer that.  Food options include pasties from Cornish Pasty Co. as well as chocolates, pastries, energy bars, and more.\n\nSpecialty Drinks:\nDesert Rose:  assam black tea w\/ rose syrup\nPillow Mint:  chocolate latte with crème de menthe\nAlmond Alegria:  almond latte with macadamia syrup\nDirty Breve:  quad shot of espresso w\/coconut and chocolate syrups and a splash of half n half\nHoneyComb:  vanilla honey latte with cinnamon steamed with the milk\n\nEven though today is the official soft opening, we actually visited the café a couple of times during their sneak previews.  I highly recommend the NITRO FLOAT which is nitro cold brew with three scoops of Tillamook vanilla ice cream:  delicious!!  I've also now had the regular latte as well as the Honeycomb latte and not disappointed at all with anything I've had here.\n  \nWe became fans of Stumptown after visiting them in Los Angeles and New York, so having a spot here in our city to get a regular fix is fabulous.  Hunter and his dad, Doug, are passionate about this coffee and it's great to support locals like this.  Welcome to Sin City, Stumptown!
