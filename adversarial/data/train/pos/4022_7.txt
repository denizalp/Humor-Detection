Usually I would question the seafood in Las Vegas because its so far from the ocean...but Oyster Bar never disappoints with its freshness! I must mention I lied when I said Bacchanal was the only place in Vegas I would wait in a line for; Oyster Bar inside Palace Station is the only other place I won't complain waiting in line for. Although, I do wish they'd buy up more space on the floor and put in a couple extra tables.. \n\nEverything they offer here is ahhmazing -both for the taste and view ;) As in their name, oysters, here are superb and a definite must order when eating here.  I highly suggest the combo pan roast which consists of shrimp, lobster, and crab. And (not or! lol) the gumbo. Just do it. You will not regret it my loves. \n\nThey charge an extra $5 if you share entrees but its totally worth it because the portions are very generous. There are no take out orders -which although can be frustrating, I do appreciate it because that means your food is as fresh as possible. And for those of you who like to fill up on soft, buttery bread, they offer that while you wait :)\n\nAnother thing I really enjoy is that you can watch the whole process of your delicious foods being prepared, cooked, plated\/bowled right in front of you! The chefs are all so nice too. Makes the whole experience that much more enjoyable. Last, for those of you who are going with another person who can't quite handle the heat like you, you're always welcomed to adjust the level of spice in your dishes. But I'd suggest nudging the ones who can't handle the spice, to the plate ;P seafood is always more yummy when its spicy!
