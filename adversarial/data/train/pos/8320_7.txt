After a surprisingly pleasant Southwest customer experience, I've decided to give them another star...\n\nSo I arrived at the Austin airport two hours early for my flight back to Phoenix (am I the only one that still arrives this early?), only to discover that my flight's been delayed two hours (I'd been camping for a few days out at Enchanted Rock without means of checking their website before we headed out). So I'm depressed, staring down the barrel of 9 more hours before I get home (4 for the airport wait \/ 5 for the flight - yeah, I bought the cheapest ticket possible, w\/ 2 stops).\n\nAs I'm heading for Security, I spot another flight on the monitor, this one leaving in half an hour. I march directly to the gate counter; there's a long line, but it's moving at a very efficient pace. Once up front just a couple of minutes later, I'm greeted with a big smile (I know - right! Wasn't expecting that!) Flight's pretty full and there's already a few folks on the wait list, but she'll see what she can do. She warned me she wouldn't know until last minute, but was kind enough to check in with me several times while I waited, making sure I knew she hadn't forgotten about me. And lo and behold, she came through for me. Last minute, just before they closed the doors, but I was on that plane, no ticket switching charge, in a window seat no less, and to top it off, it was direct - only 2 hours long. Thank you Southwest lady! Not for just doing your job but being so darn nice about it.\n\nOh yeah, did get another choice quote from a flight attendant as we came in for landing:\n\"Thank you for flying Southwest. Your flight today was sponsored by: Sally's House of Plaid, where if you're sad, it's time to wear plaid... And Little Johnny's Sewer Service, where your number two is our number one.\" WTF?
