First Friday is located in the art district near Charleston and 3rd street. You can't miss this giant festival packed with food vendors, promotors, and a variety of trinkets and much more. My favorite tent is Pop's Kabobs! They make gyros, kabobs, and spiraled potatoes covered in cheese\/bbq sauce\/ketchup\/mustard\/hot sauce... Whatever you chose! \nBut most of the food here is great and vendors are friendly! People paint in the streets on giant boards for you to view. Stuff here ranges from someone selling clothing to essential oils, jewelry to various other products--- and you can even find people doing weird things for some quick cash. There's plenty to check out an it's every first Friday of each month.
