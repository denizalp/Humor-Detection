Movie and dinner with the girl's ended here with drinks.  The weekends are busy so if you don't make a reservation you may end up at the community table as we were, which turned out to be perfect for us.  I've never been a huge fan of Bonefish, mainly because the food is just ok to me.  I understand everyone loves the bang bang shrimp but I'm not in to shrimp like that.  I did enjoy the seasoned oil and bread, probably a little too much, but definitely the highlight of my meal.  I opted for the grilled salmon with oscar topping, and spinach....it was no different from me preparing it at home for half the price.  The servers were very attentive, so I probably would come back.
