Flight attendants were generally pretty \"sour\"--not mean, but certainly not instilling a sense of cheerfulness. No pleasantries, no smiles. They seemed essentially not to enjoy the job.\n\nAt least cosmetically speaking, the plane was so old that it provided no sense of reliability or safety the way I might feel on a modern well-maintained aircraft. Silicone caulking was used around windows and other sealing points. Leather slip covers hide old worn seats. \n\nThe best part of the trip on Allegiant, and most important by far, is that it was non-stop, on time, and arrived safely at the gate. The flight cost about the same as SWA for me and my wife (because we have a Companion Pass) but saving money was not our objective. Saving time by flying non-stop is a benefit worth paying extra for. \n\nSeems like solvable issues.
