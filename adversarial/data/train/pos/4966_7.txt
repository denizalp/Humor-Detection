My experience at the Pub produced a grim milestone:  It was the first time, I've ever conscientiously sent something back to the kitchen - seriously the first time!\n\nI ordered a Shepherd's pie - a dish I normally get very excited about.  What I got was one of the most grotesque and dreadful concoctions I've ever seen.  Think of a lame version of a cobb salad having a severe accident with a plate of cold mashed potatoes, drunkenly eloping and then foolishly giving birth to this absolutely hideous Shepherd's Pie.   This is what it basically was:  Ground beef with no flavor or marinade - just loose ground beef wading in lukewarm water, raw peas and carrots smattered on top and then cold mashed potatoes that did not appear to be roasted or even put into an oven - absolutely dreary and depressing - like a meal out of George Orwell's 1984.\n\nI felt bad about sending it back - but I could hardly even look at it without getting nauseous.  Recognition has to be made to the bar-tender.  She was very sweet and replaced my order with fish and chips.  That was an redeeming factor.
