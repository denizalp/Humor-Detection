I'm a self proclaimed spa head, and I can't believe it took me so long to make my way to the Mandarin! I picked a perfect place to start off my birthday weekend!\n\nEverything is so zen and peaceful. Amethyst stones at every corner sending out good energy. I had the happiness ritual and Jesse was my masseuse. I came here after a recent loss of a friend who loved this spa. I felt close to him by being there and making a connection with Jesse helped a lot as well. My body was tight in places I didn't even know about and I'm sure I fell asleep on the table for than a couple times. I really needed this!\n\n\nThe facility has amazing views of the strip as well. With heated stone chairs and rain showers were my favorite. \n\nI will say that this spa is in the proxy side, but the services are also longer than other spas. It was well worth it to me because I left feeling rejuvenated inside and out. Thank you Mandarin
