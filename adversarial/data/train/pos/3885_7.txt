This place was advertised for all you can eat promo going on from August 1st thru 7th. We decided to try it out. Awful experience!!! They sell all you can eat for $15 but you end up realizing that would've gotten more and better for less money... This place is designed to make a fool of you, rolls come in ridiculously small sizes and with tons of rice, time of wait for the next one is about half an hour, you get to choose from only one column of the menu and except for certain rolls. Even more!! All their soy sauce is only red one which is vey salty. It's like fucking designed to make you not wanna eat it so much!! Ok so way too much rice but now listen to this!!! If you return your plate with some rice left on it you get charged for it!!! WTF?!???! Seriously??? If I eat I get charged, if I don't eat I get charged, AND get forced to eat their stupid rice just so I feel full and don't want to order anymore. This his sick!! Never again!!! \nP.S. Also sounds weird to listen to country music in a sushi restaurant.
