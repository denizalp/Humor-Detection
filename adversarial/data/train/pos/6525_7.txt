Went on a Friday night. Asian night, like 90% of the people were Asian. Which was interesting and ridiculously fun.\n\nMusic was horrible, but I hate top 40 and hip hop and all that so yeah, not my thing I barely remember what I was dancing to.\n\nDrinks were cheap - bottles of Heineken $5 bucks? Pretty good for a club...\n\nBouncers were super sweet and the crowd was actually respectful and no one pushed.\n\nI didn't like the $15 cover charge AT ALL. Why? Because you're gonna undercharge me for drinks? Not cool.... We didn't even come that late. There were two bars, or three, at least from what I saw. When you walk in there's one to the left side, it's tiny and a much bigger one in the center. Then when you go out to the main dance floor the main bar is there.\n\nThe bathrooms were LOVELY. There's all these things like creams, and hair spray, and tissues, and gum. It was so pretty and like a big doll powder room. \n\nI would come back here again if I didn't have to pay cover. And for the love of god, STOP playing only top 40...mix in a little house! a little indie! once in a while no one is even going to notice. But I will love you forever...\n\n\nPS I love Abbas.
