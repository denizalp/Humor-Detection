John Jr is the bomb!  Everyone in there is & work to fix your item thoroughly.  My fav sandals broke & my purse strap started to fray.  He explained fully how they'd fix it & if I wanted to restore the sandal even more by glueing the other sewn pieces.  I then asked him about the cracking leather on the purse I was wearing & he said he would fix it & condition it.  I have more items to take when I pick up these three such at my red bottoms that they restore also!  \n\nWalking into the store you can tell they are organized, clean & passionate about their business.  Also they have many regulars, which is a good sign.  Fairly priced, pay half now, you can put items on layaway, not in a rush for my items so Wednesday works.  When I asked John about another item, he said he'd get back to me & called me w\/ in the hour w\/ an answer.  I like that kind of service.\n\nAlso I was in there for about 45 minutes more just shopping for more bday gifts.  From shoes to purses to bags, belts wallets & beautiful ostrich cowboy boots.  Very glad to find this place which you can't miss w\/ the huge shoe mobiles parked outside.  Love it!
