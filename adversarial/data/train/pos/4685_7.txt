My first CMYE! (Stands for \"Community Manager Yelp Event\"!)\n\nThis event transported me back to the days of art class! ... and printing presses! I haven't done any \"crafty\" hands-on artwork since high school! So this was exciting!\n\nThe studio is this cute quaint haven tucked downstairs at one of the tiny shops along Queen St. West. The venue is an extension of Artscape.\n\nWe were immediately greeted with warmth and enthusiasm by the instructors, who happen to be local artists; Jessica Bromley Bartram, Pam\nLobb, and Erin Candela. The instructors were extremely sweet, friendly and informative about the process, and the use of the presses. Every student there learned quickly, and used the machines it like a pro!\n\nProvided for us were textured paper, ribbon, lace, q-tips, popsicle sticks, and paints in the colors of blue, red, and green. I'm sure other colors are available upon request. Then it was time to get dirty! (Oh behave! You know what I mean!)\n\nLessons today were Letter Presses and Monoprints! I was so delighted to see the vintage press machines! We commented on how ODD it felt to create anything hands-on these days! Sigh ...\n\nThe Letter Press is the use of block letters and characters (think large metal block stencils) to create type on paper.\n\nMonoprinting meant creating positive & negative shadows & color to create a pattern. We used fabrics & paints & other scrap materials to etch patterns on an ink medium.\n\nI thoroughly enjoyed the light music playing in the background! Nice soothing touch to add to the ambiance!\n\nGiven the small space, it felt spacious with it's open concept, all-white minimal decor and bright lighting! For such a small space, the maximum group size is 8 people. Any more and there wouldn't be enough room, or time, for everyone to enjoy every station! Cost is typically $25 for a class, materials is extra. Our class tonite was $35 per person, including material. Yay! (NOTE: CASH ONLY)\n\nI felt I didn't have enough time, but that just means I was having TOO much fun! I highly recommend letting your inner artist loose here! It's a fabulous way to spend a relaxed and inspired afternoon with the boyfriend, (or in my case, husband), mom, sister, or catching up with an old friend!\n\nI'm so happy Toronto has this hidden gem! Awesome job, Vivek S.!!! Now I'm feeling the yelptitude!
