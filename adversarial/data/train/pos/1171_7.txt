Went to my usual pharmacy and was told they had an hour wait. I had my son with me and he  was not feeling well so I decided not to leave my prescription. Saw this pharmacy and decided to give them a try.\n\nThe pharmacist there was very friendly and understanding that I had a sick kid with me. He told me he would have the medicine done in 15 min. Turns out I waited less than 10 mins and it was done! This is the fastest pharmacy I've ever been to! I will be using them from now on!
