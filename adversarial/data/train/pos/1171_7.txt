After hearing both positives and negatives about this studio, I came in with Loren M for a visit on International Yoga Day. The class itself was free, but per their controversial policy, all classes require a $2 tip for the instructor. I did not mind this but it is definitely a factor that would keep me from being a monthly member- note that if you are a regular, you don't need to carry cash, it is automatically deducted from your card on file. \n\nAs for the class I took, Venus Hot, is upstairs in a headed warehouse-style room. I've taken hot yoga before, and it definitely helps to take a mat towel to avoid slipping as you heat up and start sweating. Look up at the ceiling before you pick a spot to set up, so you know where the heaters are. I did not catch the instructors name, but she circulated the room adjusting positions and projected her voice well so that we could still hear her. We moved through the various poses a bit faster than I find typical but at least it wasn't boring. \n\nThe venue itself is fairly sparse but they do have a spacious locker room and I appreciate that each studio has the rules posted outside- discouraging late arrivals, banning phones, pointing out the shoe rack, etc. They seem to offer a pretty expansive schedule, and martial arts classes are also available on site. I will probably pop in for classes every so often, but the distance from my house and the tipping policy deter me from being a regular.
