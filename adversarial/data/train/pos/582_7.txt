Going to Padre Murphy's on Fridays for Fish and Chips is a tradition and somewhat a routine for loads of peeps in northwest Phoenix. I had to try it. My first visit was for lunch with a coworker and have been back a couple of times for their Fish & Chips on Fridays. \n\nIt's somewhat of a dated sports bar but with lots of cool sports pics on the walls and plenty of great TVs everywhere to watch sports, horse and dog races. Plenty of room, clean and inviting and even has a couple of betting windows for the race tracks. Their service is exceptional and very consistent with each visit. The crowd is somewhat of an older, couples crowd but kid friendly. \n\nPadre Murphy's bottomless Fish and Chips on Friday has a great taste and it is what a lot of peeps keep coming back for. I've tried some of their Irish dishes and found them to be average or below compared to other places. Their sandwiches and burgers are OK and their open faced roast beef plate is one of their best sellers. But I, like most peeps come here for their Fish & Chips on Fridays. \n\nMaybe I will see you there sometime on a Friday eating Fish & Chips ;-)
