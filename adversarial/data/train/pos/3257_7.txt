This was the best Thai food I ever had Hands Down!  If it wasn't for the horrible soup they give you in the beginning, I would give it five stars.\nMy friend also fell in love as well.  She got the Spicy Eggplant that she said was the best she ever had at a Thai Restaurant.  My drunken noodles with veggies and chicken was also very tasty.  I even liked their spring rolls and rice.\nI actually liked the mediocre service that they gave.  They didn't hound me for anything anddidn't ask if my food was good when my mouth was full of food.  They were always available if I needed anything though, which I thought was important. \nThe first time I went there a few months ago, I wasn't impressed.  I am so happy that I went there again.  I will be coming back.
