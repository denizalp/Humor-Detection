This place is great when you don't have time to waste refueling before\/during\/after having a night on the town. The slices are large enough to be satisfying while not putting you in a food coma. They're also delicious--they know how to do specialties like BBQ Chicken quite well. \n\nYou can get in and out in five minutes, including face-stuffing time. If I'm on mill and anyone complains about being hungry, I'm rushing them through here.
