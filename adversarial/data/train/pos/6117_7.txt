MACARONS MACARONS MACARONS!\n\nWhen you're in Vegas, do yourself a favor and go to the Venetian and get yourself a box of these macarons (maybe even two boxes). They're $17.50 for a total of 6 macarons. It might be a little pricier than most but they are delicious! They got the texture pretty perfect. Delicate flaky outside and chewy inside. YUM! My favorite was the coffee flavor (which I usually don't like in macarons but this one was excellent)!!\n\nBut I still think Euro Pane's salted caramel macaron is #1! I have yet to find one that beats that! although Chantilly comes close.  But this is a very close tie for 2nd! Get it get it get it!
