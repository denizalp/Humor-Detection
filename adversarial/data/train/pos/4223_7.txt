Rito's was recommended to me with an advisio that the owner was like Seinfeld's \"Soup Nazi\". Nothing is further from the truth. I found the owner to be pleasant, helpful and solicitous of feedback. I ordered the \"specialty\" of a green chile beef burrito and I had mine jazzed up Enchilada style with red sauce. Simply delicious.\n\nNow Rito's is a little quirky. No pork or chicken dishes, just beef (tender, flavorful beef by the way), no combinations which means everything is ala carte. Since there is limited seating, they do a lot of take out business. I ate in and the food was served in an aluminum take out container. \n\nIf you're looking for atmosphere, try Macayo's or the Rio Mirage Cafe. If you're looking for good, fresh Mexican food, give Rito's a try. You'll be glad you did.
