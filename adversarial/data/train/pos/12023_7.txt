They have a problem with bees here. Beware if you are allergic. I just moved my seat from the balcony to the bar area after a bee took a dip in my drink. The bartender said we have them here too. Ok. So nowhere here is safe. Thanks for the warning. \n\nSomeone contacted me to say I was a moron for writing this (perhaps someone who works there) Let me clarify. I ate at Sammy Hagars one block away and outside without any bees.  Yes there is a problem when I personally witness another couple ask for their check to leave because of the bees buzzing around and the waiter can't even clear the table. Yes there is a problem when I have to move my seat and when the waitstaff admits it when I tell them. Yes it's a problem when there is bee in your $11 drink you want to finish and have to fish it out. \n\nI wish I took a video of the people using their menus to swat bees or a photo of the one swimming in my drink.
