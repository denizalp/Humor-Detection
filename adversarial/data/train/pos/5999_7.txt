I had a massage here with a Groupon.  The massage therapist was good, but as I entered the room I found myself wondering if the sheets were clean.  This has never happened to me before and not sure why this popped into my head.  \nThe massage was good and the therapist personable.  Afterward I stopped by the reception desk to ask about their regular prices and whether they had  'massage club' pricing.  The receptionist started rattling off time and numbers - I thought she'd never take a breath.  When she finally took a breath I told her I was hoping for a written list as standing there listening to her was causing me back pain ( I clearly need a cane to walk).  She got all nasty and defensive and accused me of being 'rude'.  That was enough for me - I left and will never go back.
