This place is incredible! IMHO, this is the classiest casino on the strip. The level of attention that they've paid to every detail is amazing. \nThe table minimums were the highest I saw on the Strip, nothing less than $10, most $15+ on the table games. But the casino is spotlessly clean. The decor is classy. I've never really been able to figure out what the theme is to this casino. French Renaissance? I don't know. \nI really love the ceiling of the lobby, glass done by the famous artist Dale Chihuly. It's an amazing display that makes glass look like a wonderful garden of flowers. \nThe botanical gardens are also nice, with a lot of different plants and flowers to check out. \nI also enjoyed the art museum here. When I went, it was a display of Andy Warhol prints, which was a really cool display that any world-class museum would be proud to show off! \nI really enjoy this place to hang out at, but generally stay away from the Casino. The shops here are pretty amazing, with all of the high-end shops you could ever want to burn your cash at! \nOf course, the highlight of the hotel is the fountains out front!
