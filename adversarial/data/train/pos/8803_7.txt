In the best interest of everyone, due to my minor lactose intolerance, I don't do ice cream often.  But, Sugar Bowl is worth it!!  No, it is not the fancy shmancy ice cream infused with liqueur, or homemade, hand-churned with all natural ingredients from the desert...It is just good, old, run-of-the-mill, GOOD ice-cream.  Ice-cream is kind of like pizza, the bad stuff is still pretty good, and this is definitely better than most.  What sets Sugar Bowl apart is the old fashion style sundaes with whip cream and cherries (the philosophy of if it isn't broken why fix it definitely applies here), along with the traditional, charming, atmosphere of an old-school ice-cream parlor.  \n\nI would tell you my favorite desserts, but you might as well look at the menu because I would have typed the majority of it.  I have only had dessert here and not tried the food, but I don't really think the 'food' is what you come here for.  \n\nSugar Bowl takes me  back to being a kid and making my own sundaes at home...it HAD to be in the 'fancy' ice-cream dish, with a cute spoon to eat it with, and LOTS of chocolate!  And that is what makes it worth the hour long belly ache afterward ;)
