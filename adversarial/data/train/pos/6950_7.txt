I suffered from Yelper's remorse on this visit, rule #1 look it up on Yelp and read the damn reviews first. \n\nI was out and about looking for a lite bite for lunch and came across this joint. I said to myself, ok well they have a chicken bowl advertised on an outside banner so I am sure they have vegetable bowls as well.\n\nI mean seriously how can you screw up on a bowl of rice and veggies? Well they proved my theory wrong!\n\nI ordered a veggie bowl with brown rice. I paid my $5 (small bowl) and took it to go to later unwrap a bowl of soggy and wilted broccoli all (2) tiny pieces and cucumber slices galore.  The brown rice was ok what there was of it. The teriyaki sauce was ok that was lightly glazed covering the veggies. \n\nI was disappointed to say the least, they should rename it the \"2 pieces of broccoli and cucumber slices wilted to perfection bowl\".\n\nSS, you bent me over for my $5 this time, but I will stand tall and pull my panties up and walk away and forget you exist.\n\nNot the happy ending I was looking for :(
