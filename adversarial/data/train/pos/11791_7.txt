They deleted half my video!!!\nMy wedding had a blooper.  When I was half-way down the isle, I stopped and said \"we're doing this again!\"  WHY WOULD YOU DELETE THAT?!?!  That's part of the ceremony!  I was looking fwd to seeing and laughing at that memory!\n\nHUGELY DISAPPOINTED with this company.\nI paid for the entire ceremony to be recorded.  That's what I should have gotten!!!
