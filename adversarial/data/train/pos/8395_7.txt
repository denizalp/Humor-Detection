I love Cave Creek.  Cowboys, bikers, and bulls. What is not to love?  It's visitor season for me and a group of us wanted to actually stay in town for the bullriding.   It's annoying to have to not partake in the cheap drinks up there because someone hsas to drive back to town.  So, we stayed finally.  \n\nCave Creek doesn't have a huge population of hotels, unfortunately.  Carefree has much nicer ones, but that is too far when there are no cabs in the area and defeats the purpose of not having to drive.  The Tumbleweed is right out of a movie set.  It's basic and it's vintage; but most importantly it's right smack in the middle of everything in 'town'.  \n\nThe lobby is situated in a store so be on the lookout as we got a little confused.  We got the 'deluxe' room with a small kitchenette. (only because it was sold out).  The room was clean, hysterical with it's western theme.  Free wifi is available.\n\nIs this a fancy resort? NOt even close.  It's a bit overpriced, but hey, they aren't stupid. They are the only hotel in walking distance. So if you find yourself wanting to stay out late in CC and hang with the cowboys, this is a safe (albeit slightly overpriced) bet.
