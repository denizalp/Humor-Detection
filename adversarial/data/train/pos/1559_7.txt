This place really stinks. The service was awful. The frumpy waitron seemed pained by us being there and rarely even looked in  our direction. We sat with empty glasses for at least ten minutes. Had to go the bar to get our cocktails. The bartender was fast, but then he put the drinks on the table tab and winked at the waitron. WTF? Needless to say, no one got the tip. I saw many tables gazing longingly at the server who could obviously care less about being there. \n\nAnd the food? Straight out of a can. The bar just seemed kinda dirty... like a barn or something. The locals warned us! We really should have stayed away. The name of the joint was a red flag as well. Lesson learned.
