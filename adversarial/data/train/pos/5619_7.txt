Why is everyone so damn cheap?? I just cant get over it. Every review I read ppl are complaining about the price. Its like ppl expect to pay $10 for a 4 course 5 star dinner. \n\nI am not super cheap but I am also not frivolous either. I just have a realistic view of the world- living is expensive; people have to make a living. My experience so far in life is that most people are very entitled- entitled to have the world and not have to work\/pay for it. \n\nNow I am sure some ppl are offended by this and their mentality is \" I dont mind paying as long as I get what I pay for?\" Ok, fair enough. But let me ask you this- What is a reasonable price for an entree at a 5 star restaurant? or better yet... What is a reasonable price for a visit to an aquarium?  \n\nGiven the fact that an aquarium has to take care of all the animals and pay the staff and make a profit to stay in business...I would say $15 is more than reasonable. So that is a $3 difference.  Now, is $3 really worth complaining about and writing about and getting all worked up about?? Does $3 make the animals any less beautiful and the experience any less fun for you and\/or your kids?? NO  \n\nLets say they only charged $10 and the animals were not taken care of properly and the staff was making minimum wage which cannot support their families. Is saving your $8 worth that?? NO\n\nI try to buy as many products that are MADE IN AMERICA for exactly the same reason...spend a few more cents and bring the factories back to our country and our people...
