Friendly service.  Nice little place with wood panel on the walls.  Enjoyed a variety of things including the Mazza Platter.  The mummus, tabbouli were good but the baba ghannouj just tasted like smoke.  The Gyro was good, thicker cuts of meat instead of the thin sliced.  The meal took a little longer than we expected.\n\nIt is BYOB, did not bring any in but the menu said, \"BYOB $10 per bottle.\"  WOW is that expensive!  Do not understand charging that much.  Did notice a liquor license application in the window.
