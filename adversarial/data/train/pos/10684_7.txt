Leave it to Charlotte to have a dim sum restaurant NAMED Dim Sum Chinese Restaurant. Only natives understand the complex simplicity of this concept. This is one of two restaurants that serve dim sum in all of Charlotte. Thus, market strategy = all discreetness voided. \n\nDespite the lack of creativity in the name and competition, the dim sum here is pretty good and actually better than the places I've tried in Atlanta. The dishes are flavorful and the food authentic. My favorites are the fried taro balls and stuffed eggplants.\n\nSundays are when they push the carts around. I recommend coming early (12pm or earlier) so you'll have dibs on \"the good stuff.\" They always run out of my favorites early. Plus, that's when the food is hot and fresh!
