We paid $200 total for 3 nights over a weekend in August... what the what?! That means it was only $50 a person for the entire trip. I don't think you can beat that on the strip unless you get a completely comped room. \n\nWe got lucky with a renovated room on the 20th floor and lacked any of the issues on here write about.. no bed bugs (THANK THE LORD!), water pressure was fine, no security issues\/theft, no noise complaints... It was a perfectly okey-dokey place for us to lay our head down at night.\n\nPlus, now with Uber in the area, it's around $5-8 to get to hotels like Paris, Bellagio, etc. The location being on the most South end of the strip is not much of an issue anymore.\n\nI wouldn't go out of my way to stay here because I like hotels with more restaurant options and better clubs, but it got the job done!
