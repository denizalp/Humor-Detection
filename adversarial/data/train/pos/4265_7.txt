I need to find a way to add glittery stars around this: YUM!!!! DELISH!!!!! \n\nI recently ventured to Postino again, and it is probably the only place that I can fall in love with over and over again. Okay..a bit dramatic..but I take food seriously (if you couldn't tell). \n\nThe location and ambiance are perfect. The interior is decorated very tastefully and the selection of wine is proudly displayed. The patio is wonderful and relaxing. \n\nI was there for lunch and ordered the half panini (prosciutto and brie) with a salad (raspberry chicken). The panini was stuffed full of fresh ingredients and perfectly crunchy. The salad was crispy, with delicious chicken and sweet\/tart raspberry dressing. \n\nThe service was impeccable, while all along being super friendly. This seems to be a hard thing to find these days. \n\nAnd on a sidenote...what makes Postino special is not their extravagant extensive menu, but the simplicity and thought that goes into every single ingredient. And these ingredients are of the highest grade and quality. You will not find a load of crap on your plate that you don't need or that kills the true flavors. \n\nHeaven. \n\nOr at least what I would like to eat there.
