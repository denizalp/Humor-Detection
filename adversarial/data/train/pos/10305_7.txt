This is the only official place in Canada to get your Omega* repaired. \n\nIt's pretty much an office\/drop-off area open 9-4 Tuesday through Friday. They require a few days to work on the watch, and they let you know when you can pick it up on the spot. \n\nThey do a great job with the repairs involving everything from mechanical to strap and aesthetic issues. \n\n-------\n*I'm sure that includes other major Swiss watch brands as well.
