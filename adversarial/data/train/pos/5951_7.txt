I want to start by saying that these are the nicest and friendliest people.  Their place is super clean and neat.  \nHaving said that,  the food is average at best.  The burrito was large but the taste was not there.  Food was lacking in salt and seasoning.  \nThe fry bread with beef, beans and cheese was super large but again, not tasty at all.  I added salt and it still did nothing for the dish so we both packed the food almost intact.  That was a $20 hit and no dinner. \n\nThe fry bread itself was tasty but after the beans and the cheese on top (not melted just Kroger shredded cheese on top), the fry bread became limp.  The beef tasted cooked, not grilled as there was no char on it.  Not flavorful at all.  Both dishes were disappointments.  \nI see all the 5 star ratings.  That just means that people don't know flavors or don't cook themselves or don't know what it's really supposed to taste like.   \nI wish them continue luck as they clearly have a following but it won't be me.
