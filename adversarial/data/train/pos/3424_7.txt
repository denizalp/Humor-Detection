Seriously not a fan. Been here many many times trying to give it the benefit of the doubt because of friends but this is one of the most overrated places ever. The whole \"order your taco\" like chipotle thing aside the service is at best mediocre. The number of times it takes, without, exaggeration 10 minutes to get approached to even order a drink (and they are always out of half of the selections) is ridiculous. Good thing they are open late and serve alcohol. \n\nThis is not a Mexican restaurant. It's a hipster chipotle with a full liquor license.
