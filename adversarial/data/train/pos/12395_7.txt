Ever feel trapped in a nightmare you can't escape? A nightmare that keeps coming back night after night after night? A nightmare that only you can experience the horror of and you can't get anyone else in on? WELL, that describes my last 6 months at 80 on Gibson.\nOver the last 6 months my apartment, as well as the 2 apartments next to mine (in my complex) have been lucky enough to experience a constant banging every. single. night. The noise is random and comes on anywhere from 8PM - 4AM. It is always 3-4 bangs, followed by a 2 minutes of sweet, sweet silence, repeated over and over. It is not any of the neighbors (as confirmed with other neighbors) and sounds more like a banging of something inside the walls\/pipes\/heaters? Who knows. But how do you get something resolved that only happens after the office closes? You don't. Because it's after hours and no one can come to hear the noise, no one knows what to fix (or more like no one cares what it is) and thus will not be resolved. I'm sure this is not the only issue their tenants have had and I can't imagine the sort of help they would provide if they won't even go outside of their \"office hours\" to help out. \nMy previous review still stands. No other developments since then! :) \nThere are plenty of apartment complexes in Henderson to choose from- there is no need to choose this one right here :)
