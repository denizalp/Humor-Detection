If you plan to stay there, helll no,,,, pls , this hotel is the worst i have ever stayed. NO kidding!!! lousy room, lousy service, the most ridiculous part is, they charge you with something you cannot imagine. I booked 3 rooms for overnight staying... due to budget concern cos we went in group. They charge me $130 for each plus $7.50 for resort fee(i have no idea what is that). The worst part is after i checked out & i realized that my credit card was billed another $250. I immediately called my credit card company to dispute & they transferred me to Stratosphere customer service...u know what they told me???? Sir... you broke the door, we fixed it, and bill you......come on!! that is sooo...ridiculous....WE NEVER BREAK THE DOOR!!! we check in late evening & sleep, helllo!!! we do not party in the room, we do not drink, how could we break the door??? I think that;s just another way they try to make more $$$. I am now still disputing, what the heck is this hotel..!!!! PLS, IF YOU HAVEn't TRY THIS, NEVER,.....EVER!!!
