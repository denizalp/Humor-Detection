The Soleil Pool has a great view of the Eiffel Tower but that's all it has going for it. \n\nIt's really just one large pool with a bunch of beach chairs surrounding it. Show your room key & receive towels at the entrance. There's a bar at the back where you can buy drinks since they don't allow outside drinks\/food. \n\nSince we had a room facing the pool, we could hear the music all day long. They start at about 10 or 11AM & go till the sun disappears. There's lots of arches with greenery which provide shade from the 100+ degree weather. Sometimes it can get annoying if you're tanning cause it'll block the sun... \n\nIt's not horrendous but it's not over the top oozing with glam or edge like most of Vegas. If you wanna relax, come here. If you wanna party, this ain't it.
