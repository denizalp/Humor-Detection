Finally I got to say the words 'small block all the way with cheese please' and be satisfied completely again....sigh....it is as if the whole Penguin ownership fighting disaster was just a bad dream.  I didn't try the fried pickles to see if they were up to par like the old Penguin but the burger was DEFINITELY deja vu.  The inside of the restaurant is bigger than I thought it would be and the vibe similar if not the same.  Love you Diamond!  You will be my Charlotte staple for many happy small block years to come....
