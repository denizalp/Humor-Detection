* Inspired by Charlton L. to not to be lazy and finally write this. :]\n\nMy first time here was back in November 2008 when a group of friends and I went on a celebratory Vegas trip. It was our last night in Vegas and we collectively decided to eat at the Wynn buffet since we were going to party at Tryst.\n\nIt's an amazing buffet! I was seriously thanking myself for not wearing some skin tight outfit because I would have been popping out of it! However, walking around all \"dressed up\" (and some what skimpy with killer heels) around families and little kids was a bit awkward. \n\nBut hey, who cares when there is all you can eat King Crab legs and an amazingly large assortment of food, right?! The food was good. I ate to my heart's content.. and to my stomach capacity and it was worth it.\n\nThe only downside to this buffet that I found was the dessert. They all looked so amazingly delicious and oh so cute (mini sizes\/portions) but they really didn't taste the way they looked. I think I only liked one thing out of the whole lot :(.
