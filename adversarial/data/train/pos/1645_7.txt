The TAMALES...\n.\n**2017 Yelp 100 Challenge #13 **\n.\nThis place was just somewhere we stumbled upon because we were hungry before a YEE that was happening across the street & I needed to eat something before the event since there wasn't food other than hot dogs which are like one of my least favorite foods. The inside seems like an authentic back in the days Mexican restaurant. Whole bunch of COLORFUL decorations everywhere w\/ stuff hanging all over the ceilings. \n.\nWe sat at the bar since we were going to be quick & we just kept sitting at the bar ever since. There is this one guy bartender that we love w\/ his Hispanic accent he is quick & funny & attentive just right. Forgot his name... =\/\n\nwe didn't really explore to much into the menu &  just ordered what we were craving at the moment.\n\nCHIPS W\/ SALSA & BEAN DIP $0 - AHHHH this is the best kind of complimentary chips & salsa bean dip that we have tasted. i dunno what they use in their been dip but it is just SO addicting!!! literally makes you want to order a whole bowl and put it on EVERYTHING\n\nCHICKEN W\/ GREEN SAUCE TAMALES $3.75 - the chicken was nice & tender. could have possibly used a little more seasoning but i just added some of the complimentary salsa & bean dip.\n\nCHEESE W\/ JALAPENOS $3.75 - this was cheesy oooo eee goooeyy yummyness & it was warm & just perfectly made\n\nTOSTADAS CAMARON $7.75 - this dish was freaken AWSOME! SO much freaken shrimp for a little taco. Definitely had to use some of the complimentary chips to eat the rest of the shrimp. The shrimp was chopped up w\/ some veggies mixed w\/ citrus & topped off w\/ avocado.\n\nDefinitely will be coming back every time we want some margaritas & tamales & tostadas!!\n.
