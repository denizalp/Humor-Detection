This location is in a parking lot that is not well lit, littered with trash and occupied by assorted characters of Boulder Highway. Once inside you will find that the only difference from the parking lot is - the store is well lit. Lighting is important because the aisles are small and I would like to see who the person is that is standing too close for my comfort. Personal space is mandatory in my world. First aisle had no room as a family of 6 were studying the labels of shampoo bottles. Next aisle I attempted to go down had a person that looked like they needed the personal care aisle and not the candy aisle... he was counting change and looked like he was a little short. Being the type to not give to randomly (I like to be be charitable in specific venues) I chose a different aisle. Another bad choice; a woman was opening and eating a package of M&M's and they dropped and rolled down the aisle away from her and towards me. \nI stopped here because I had heard from a friend that Mio water enhancer was on super deal. \nI traveled through the store to browse and came across a woman with her back to me looking at merchandise. She passed a lot of gas, very loudly and without concern to her. I decided to just head out the door. Mio is important to me, but an assault on all of my senses was too much to endure.
