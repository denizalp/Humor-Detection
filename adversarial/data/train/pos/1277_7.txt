One thing that I forget about University towns is that it's totally ok to be a bum and waste hours of your life away in coffee shops. I'll remember this again soon enough. I tried to train myself to get back into that mindset when I recently visited WI. Though I decided against attending UWisc in the fall, I am quite envious that they have this fine place here. It reminded me of the higher-end places back in the Bay Area. They pulled a mean espresso and they also do per-cup drip coffees. The furniture is excellently comfy as well...I almost finished an incredibly long book while I was there because I comfortably lost track of time.
