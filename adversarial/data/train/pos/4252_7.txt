What a cute resto! It's quaint and everything is white. I found it romantic.  Not sure why there was a TV in the resto but it wasn't on so it was OK.  It was a great date resto for Valentine's Day. I started the night with a dirty gin martini. My bf and I shared everything. We started with one antipasto and one entree. Those two dishes made my night! We had the carpaccio di mango con tartufo nero. It was so good! It's beef carpaccio with black truffle. The pink sauce tasted Asian to me even though the menu said black truffle.I'm  not sure what was in the sauce but it was good and the meat was fresh. We also had the tortellini funghi porcini and panna tartufato . In English it's tortellini stuffed with porcini mushrooms and truffle cream. OMG this was amazing! Definitely my favorite dish! The waiter told us this was their signature dish and I can see why. The tortellini is always on the menu while other items change from time to time. We then had the beef filet (filetto di bue). The meat was cooked the way I liked it but my bf felt like it lacked taste. I did feel like it could have used more salt or spices. The veal chop (Costelatta di vitellino) was better than the beef. I especially love the fat. Then again I love the fat on meat. Mmm. The waiter said this too was their signature dish. I highly highly recommend the tortellini and the carpaccio and the chop. I would go back and try their other stuff. Everything looked so good. The waiter was so nice and brought out a free dessert. It was deep fried pizza dough with hazelnut sauce. Think fancy, rich nutella!  It was good but we didn't finish the dessert because we were so full. It was so nice of them!
