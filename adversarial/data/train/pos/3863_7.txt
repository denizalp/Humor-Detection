My boyfriend and I stayed in a Fab room for 3 nights.  We had stayed in a Go room in July 2012 and thoroughly enjoyed our stay, so we decided to stay at the Flamingo for our 2013 trip.  Our room was on the 18th floor and there was a large yellow trash can right outside of the elevators catching \"water\" from a leak in the ceiling.  \n\nThe furniture in the Fab room was terrible.  I did not unpack my clothes as I didn't want to put them in the ratty old dresser with the wood that was chipping.  The bathroom is totally outdated.  There was no plug in our shower and the water pressure was so strong it was painful.  I also had the mirror that hangs on the wall fall ON me while I was standing in front of the closet.  \n\nThe food court at the Flamingo was one of our favorite perks as it was perfect for late night eats.  Well, the food court is CLOSED due to plumbing and it didn't look like it would open any time soon.  Also, since Bill's next door is being totally remodeled, there is construction, dirt, and homeless right outside the Flamingo doors.  \n\nWe will never stay at this hotel again.  It's hard to believe that it's totally gone downhill in the span of 1 year.  You are better off staying across the street at the newly remodeled Bally's
