Uncle John's Candy Shack is somewhat small and narrow and full of colourful treats! There is a great selection of candy, cold beverages, grocery, and a nice British line of sweets.\n\nThey have the familiar candy stock that includes Nerds, Toffee, and Gummy Bears to name a few. The Cadbury chocolate bars came in plenty of sizes- from regular bar to something as big as an elephant meal! Also, the British line was rather interesting since they had both British sweets and baked goods. They had things like Nestles, Mars, Marks and Spencer, Tea Biscuits, Curly Wurly's, UK fudge, Iron Brew, Scottish Bread, Meat Pies etc. All imported from the UK. The only downfall about this place was that I was expecting more British imports, but found a larger selection of familiar treats I could really get anywhere.\n\nThe prices are reasonable, the store is organized well and the staff is kind and helpful. I would recommend Uncle John's Candy Shack especially if you're looking for some retro candy or some interesting British sweets or baked goods.
