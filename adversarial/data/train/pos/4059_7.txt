In exchange for watching our little one, my in-laws proposed that we meet up at Crackers & Co to make the switch. A new breakfast place AND we get a date day? I'm game!\n\nWhen we first arrived, I was a little skeptical. The Cafe is located in a little strip mall behind the Home Depot, right next to a cabinet place. But, I'm learning to be adventurous, so I decided to not judge this place by its surroundings. Wise decision!\n\nWe showed up during what I thought would be prime brunch time on a Sunday morning. Surprisingly, there was absolutely no wait. We were ushered to our table by the hostess, where we were greeted by, arguably, the most cheerful, interactive, and helpful waitress I've ever encountered. Thank you, Luana.\n\nWe looked over the menu for a few minutes, it didn't really take us long to figure out what we wanted. My daughter got the kids pancakes, and my wife and I each ordered the Healthy Scram.  For the so called \"kids\" portion of pancakes, my daughter received three full grown pancakes. Of course, she couldn't finish them. If she had, I imagine she would have been in a coma for the next two days.\n\nAs for my wife's and my meal...absolutely delicious. We each opted to have two extra egg whites scrambled in with our orders. Essentially, it ends up being an oversized egg white omelette. Couple that with a cup of fresh fruit and a dry English muffin, and you've got yourself an amazingly healthy and filling breakfast\/brunch\/dinner... whenever you decide to eat it, I assure you, it will be delicious.\n\nThe three of us ended up spending about $40 for our meals. The price is a little bit inflated, though, as it does cost $1.00 extra per egg white added to our omelettes. But, whatever. you pay for what you get...and we got an awesome meal!\n\nIf you're looking for a cozy breakfast place with a great menu with healthy options, awesome atmosphere, a patio, and (in our case), the greatest service we've experienced in QUITE some time, then you should definitely stop by!
