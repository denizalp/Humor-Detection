I don't usually write reviews for a supermarket but I just had to get this off my chest;\n\nFirst off, the prices are great and they offer a variety of things that I wouldn't usually find in my local supermarket which is fine..\n\nTHE only thing that became strange to me was one time I was purchasing a few items with my boyfriend and the lady at the cash commented how my roots were showing and that I needed to dye my hair. LIKE WHERE DID THAT COME FROM?!?! It was so random!  I don't know whether she was just having a bad day or she gets exploited for pennies but I found that to be rude and uncalled for.  I'd rather shop at another asian supermarket thank you very much!
