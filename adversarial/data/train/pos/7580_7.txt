:( I just want to apologize to my GF real quick on the two stars because she loves this place and I just can't do it.\n\nUp until a couple of weeks ago I hadn't had Papa Johns in about 10 years. I've never been a fan and always preferred Pizza Hut. The quality of ingredients is better. Anyway, she suckered me into giving it a chance and I can't say I'm impressed. There were so many ingredients but I still felt like it was bland in a way...nothing too special about it. They're also a bit overpriced in my opinion.
