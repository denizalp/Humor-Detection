I wandered into Sweet Tomatoes...err, Sweet Tomatoes Field Kitchen on a whim out to dinner with my family, and what a surprise! The interior has been renovated to give it a fresh, lively and welcoming feel along with a crop of super-friendly staff who were there to explain the change and walk us through the new concept.\n\nI ordered the Japanese Steakhouse Wedge (to fulfill my craving for ST's Oriental Chicken Salad that I love so much) and it was better than anything I had ever eaten at the old Sweet Tomatoes. Extremely fresh with perfectly-cooked beef and a delectable dressing that I've been thinking of ever since..\n\nThe rest of my party tried the rotisserie beef brisket, pork ribs and the Baja Shrimp salad, all of which were enjoyed all around. I snuck a bite of the Mac n Cheese with bacon and caramelized onions -- that and my salad were worth a trip back, for sure!\n\nIt's a bit more pricey than the OG Sweet Tomatoes, but worth it. I wasn't a big frequenter of the original concept but can definitely see myself visiting the new ST\/FK every few weeks. Looking forward to trying some of the other menu items!
