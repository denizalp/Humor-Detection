Unbelievable Restaurant \"Policies \" :\n\n1. No separate bills (even if you ask as soon as you sit down as a group of 7) but they allow you to split the bill YOURSELF and pay by different method = DO YOUR OWN MATH! \n\n2. Sorry, No Balsamic Vinegar with their Precious Olive Oil!!!!! Even if you ask for some, they won't give it to you, that's their Policy!!!! Don't even bother asking or Bring Your Own Balsamic!\n\n3.  This is not as important but remember, everything is \"As Is\".  They won't customize for you if you ask them to Take some ingredient away. Wonder what if I am allergic...... Hm......\n\n4.  They don't have a comment card or website area for customer to leave feedback..... I guess they must have thought they are perfect as they don't care what their customer thinks.....\n\nFor me, doesn't matter how good the taste is, customer service is still a very important  element.
