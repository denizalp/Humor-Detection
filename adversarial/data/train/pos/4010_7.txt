I ordered through UberEATS. That portion of the experience was phenomenal. What wasn't so phenomenal was the presentation of what I ordered. I ordered the 8\" cookie cake for $20.00 and received a $5-$10 dollar product. There was no presentation what so ever. Definitely a rip off. The cookie cake was tasty, but save your money. It wasn't $20 worth of tasty.
