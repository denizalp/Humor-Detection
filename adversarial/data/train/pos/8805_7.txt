YELP FAILED ME ONCE AGAIN.\nFirst of all I would only give this place 1 star but Yelp would Filter and hide that review for being too low.  But mark my word this place is NOOOOOOO 4.5 star Chinese food.  Gimme a break.  Yelp once again failed me.\nTwo days ago I went on yelp to find a great Chinese Restaurant.  I wanted the best in Phoenix.  This place was by far one of the best reviewed.  I should have known better because I have been YELPED TRAPPED before.  But the wife and I went anyway.\n\nHere a the lowdown.\n\nLady who took order and guy cooking food.  Really nice.\n\nNow the FOOD.\n\nOrdered 3 dishes on the Lunch time special list.  5 bucks each plus tax.\n\nGot Orange Chicken.  Worst I ever ate.  Was in a Sweet and Sour Pork Batter not the traditional Orange Chicken crispy batter they use at EVERY Chinese place in California.\nAlso got General Tso's Chicken.  WTF was that.  No sweetness, no hint of Hoisin Sauce at all.  Was terribly fried and wayyyyyy over salted.  I nevered tasted such garbage dish from a takeout non buffet res in my life.  seriously could have done better myself with just the jar stuff at the grocery store.\nWife got Chicken Lo-Mein.    Wasn't the worst I ever tasted or the best.\n\nOverall, either people in the 19 Ave Glendale Area don't know junk about Chinese food or they are FAKING reviews themselves and posting them online.  Because no way this place was 4.5 stars.  \n\nFAIL\n1 Star  Mall Chinese beats this garbage.
