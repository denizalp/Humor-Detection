I recently had to use uber due to bad weather to get to work. My carpool buddy decided to work from home that at the last minute and I had to get a cab. They charged me TWO AND A HALF TIMES the regular price. I was charged 100 bucks for a trip that usually costs 35 to 40 dollars. Before ordering the ride, I had no idea I'll be paying such an outrageous amounts. It wasn't a short ride either that I can over look this one time. Besides, it just isn't fair. \n\nI actually tried lyft first but they had a very clear message that said they'll be charging an additional more. It said it was to encourage shared driving. Besides, I was in a rush to get to work so I am not sure if it was a one time thing or not, but I was at least aware that if I rode lyft that morning, I will be charged extra. \n\nSo I tried uber. I ended up paying 250% at the end of the trip! The whole concept of uber was that they're fair and transparent. This totally ruins that for me. I am really disappointed and I don't think I will be using this very often, and definitly not without reading ALL of the fine print - which makes uber loose the edge yet again, because Uber was supposed to be QUICK.\n\nIf I knew this earlier on, I would have ordered a discount cab and saved a lot of money!
