For a Vegas trip, I snagged the $20 worth of food and drinks Groupon (list price $14 but I paid around $10 with additional discount).   We used this as a quick respite when the walking became a bit much - and it worked fine for that purpose.  \n\nMiddle of the afternoon, it was nearly empty - but I get the sense this place is rocking later in the evening.  \n\nBut with it being that empty, service was painfully slow.  We didn't have silverware or napkins and couldn't get anyone's attention.   And the bathrooms require a code and trying to flag anyone down to get that information was not easy.  \n\nStill, a couple of drinks and 2 big pretzels ($9 each - served with ale mustard and cheese sauce) provided enough sustenance to get back to the sightseeing.  And some of the signage is actually funny - a veritable ode to over-imbibing.    Which is what I suspect Rock & Reilly's is REALLY all about.
