Salad King. I love you. I know you are more \"fuzion\" than Thai, but I forgive you. Honestly, in my mind you could do no wrong.\n\nA fresh to Toronto (and fresh faced) Jennifer of a decade ago, would frequent the small and no frills location on Gould, with Ryerson student card in hand for the 50% off deal (between 2 and 5pm) almost daily.  So many memories! Evil Jungle Prince, eating beside Ja-Rule, the time my girlfriend and I ordered 15 chilis and almost died. \n\nMy heart broke a bit when they gentrified, cleaned up, went handheld devices and communal tables. It did. And my Salad King consumption declined as I graduated and moved on.\n\nCoworker and I, hungry, wandering on Yonge, visited Salad King for dinner after post works drinks on a Thursday evening. Everything is shiny and modern, and I am happy to report, just as good as SK of yesteryear.\n\nBonus Points\n- my adorable and friendly server was actually Thai. (fun right?) I got to practice my pathetic broken Thai phrases on her. \n- Thai Basil noodle 7 chilis is EXACTLY the same as it always was. Amazing.\n- There were plenty of choices for my DC who does not really enjoy pan-asian cusine.\n- Prices were fair. I had a meal, and took two to go for my jealous SO and friend, and my bill was $34. \n- Only Salad King gives me food as Spicy as I like it. 7 chilis was, and always has been, perfect.  \n\nMinus Points\n- I like tea\n- No Chopsticks? what gives?\n- I don't like sitting with newly dating university students fawning all over each other. \n\nSo Happy to have you back. Long Live the King!
