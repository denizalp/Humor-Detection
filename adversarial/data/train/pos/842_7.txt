A rainy Montreal day gave us an excuse to explore this fantastic museum. Save half a day to wander through the five buildings. The line to get in and purchase tickets was thirty minutes long, but I think it was just the weather's impact. They have a bunch of exhibits that are an extra fee, but the permanent collection was more than enough for our visit for the regular price. The buildings are connected underground, but it's a bit of a maze, even if you have the map. There's also a gift shop, a caf√©, and decent WiFi. To break the buildings down simply: \n\nDesmarais Pavilion - modern and contemporary art collection, the largest one\n\nHornstein Pavilion - archaeology and ancient art\n\nLilian and David M. Stewart Pavilion - decorative arts and design\n\nClaire and Marc Bourgie Pavilion - Quebec and Canadian art\n\nMichal and Renata Hornstein Pavilion for Peace - international art collection\n\nThere's something for everyone. Whether you're into Rembrandt, Native sculptures, or weird chairs, you'll find yourself mesmerized. Let your inner nerd out!
