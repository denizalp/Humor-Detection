Decor Galor! \n\nBack home I was a frequent visitor of Hobby Lobby and I was happy to see one finally open up here in Vegas. Since my home is fully furnished and decorated I may on occasion stop in a store to get that much need updated piece to bring everything current. Hobby Lobby is a nice start.\n\nLately I've been itching to get something trendy like Chevron patterns, more animal prints or a grey-washed industrial chic look.  Lucky for me I found it all here and more. It's not for one type of look like Z-Gallerie or West Elm you will find something for all types of distinguishing eyes from country ceramic roosters to kids room neon palates and everything in between including craft items and things you would find at Michael's. \n\nSharky pics for the kids room!\nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/hobby-lobby-las-vegas?userid=uEvusDwoSymbJJ0auR3muQ#ywQCu2kLghtVME5FalOYzg\n\nBest buys are items on sale. Otherwise bring a coupon-don't pay full-price.   http:\/\/www.hobbylobby.com\/weekly\/coupon.cfm\n\nOwners value Sunday as a day of worship so don't bother coming on that day it will be closed. \n\nThe only downer is that you'll spend more time at the registers. Long lines :( no matter what city you're in.  Back home it was the same.
