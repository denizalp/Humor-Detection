After a day of drinking beers all day at a baseball game and later on at a Oyster festival, responsible decisions had to be made......\n\nIt was time to switch to wine at dinner.\n\n\nBuca is a beautiful, upscale and lavish restaurant in the heart of Toronto. \n\nGetting reservations on the fly aren't easy, especially when one of the people in your party might be slurring their words but apparently my friends were able to pull some strings, if you you know what I mean. (I have no idea what I mean, I don't know they got us a table but I ain't complaining) \n\nAfter leaving the restaurant we first had a table at, we got up and walked through some alley ways and ended up at Buca. The place is visually stunning. For the ambiance and quality of food, the price isn't bad at all. Since it was my last night in the city, it was the perfect way to say goodbye. \n\nThe food was fantastic. My friend got the duck with egg pasta, which was phenomenal. I got the ravioli which was some of the best I've ever had. Everyone loved their meal and was satisfied beyond belief. \n\nIt was a nice bitter sweet moment.
