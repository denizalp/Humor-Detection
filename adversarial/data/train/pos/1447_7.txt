My family recommended this shop to me when I started having problems with my car. My stepdad has trusted Tom as his mechanic for years, and I really just wanted to go to a place where I knew I wouldn't get ripped off and made to purchase something I didn't need.\n\nWhenever I've had worries about something needing to be replaced, Tom always lets me know if I can go a few more months before buying new parts. I usually pay about $65 for an oil change for my 350Z, which is a few dollars more than what I'd be paying at a Jiffy Lube but the trust and assurance makes it worth it.
