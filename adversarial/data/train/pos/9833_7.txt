Definitely not mad at this place.  We stayed here for our last Vegas trip.  My friends specifically chose this place because it's a non-smoking hotel and they brought their baby.  We stayed in two connected one bedroom suites.  \n\nI walked into the hotel and the first thing that I noticed was how good it smells.  Can't quite put my finger on what it smells like but I know it ain't no glade air freshener. lol!\n\nMy best friend's brother: DAAAAAMN HOMIE, this hotel is the shit! This is wassup! Gangstaaaa!\n\nEnglish translation: Dang man, this hotel is exquisite. It's so nice in here. Cool beans. \n\nOur rooms were on the 37th floor.  The rooms were nice.  I mean there wasn't anything that really stood out to me but it was a comfortable stay.  The beds were comfortable.  We had a kitchen in each room, both fully stocked with cooking appliances and utensils.  This was great since there weren't any late night restaurants in the hotel.  We had the liberty to cook our own spam and rice. (gheeeettttttoooooo) hahah. The fridge was is a good size.  Big enough to fit a liter of Greygoose and my Jameson of course.  \n\nThe bathroom was nice.  A lot of room for people to take a bath, shower, and use the toilet all at the same time.  (not that this happened.............) \n\nThe last day of waking up here I woke up laying on my back with a bowl of Cheeze-Itz on my tummy, a wrapped cigar next to my head, a missing tooth,  one shoe on,  a tiger in the bathroom,  and there was also a crying baby in the closet. (jk about the baby)\n\nI didn't give them 5 stars because we barely had any cell phone reception.  What if your Vegas hook-up was trying to call you to come up to your room?!!?! hahahah kidding once again..............
