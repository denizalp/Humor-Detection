Not bad.\n\nThere are better churasquiera's out there, but this isn't bad either, for the area.\n\nThe chicken is good. The wings are good (nice grill taste). The hot sauce is the star. The house salad is not impressive. The rice is dry. The potatoes are ok.\n\nAll in all, a fresh option for the area.
