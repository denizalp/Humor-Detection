I was really blown away by this place. Had dinner with two others. Service was friendly and helpful. We got the Tortilla chips with all three types of dip ($14, but with only one dip $7)-- all amazing. The chips by themselves were also amazing. We ran out of chips but had a bit of the dips left, and when we asked for a few more chips, they kindly gave us a little bowl of more chips. That was great.\n\nWe each got one taco and were all very impressed with them. Interesting, unique flavour combinations that worked really well. I got the one vegetarian option and was very satisfied.\n\nThe real winner was the street corn however. This was crazy crazy good, best corn I have ever had hands down (and I've had some pretty tasty corn on the cob).\n\nFor dessert we got the churros and the cake. The cake was the only thing that I thought was good, but didn't blow me away. The churros were delicious. Not to greasy and heavy, the dough was light and a bit crispy. Well seasoned with sugar and cinnamon, and it came with a very sweet and delectable caramel sauce.
