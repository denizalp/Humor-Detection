Ok. First off.... I like things clean and this place is way off of the mark. Going in was like stepping into a old basement with donuts. What? There is no lighting, something that has splattered over literally ALL surfaces, the tables were unwashed and over all nastiness everywhere! I was shocked. \n\nMy son and I each had a donut. Those were fine... but I have had better at a gas station. \n\nThe service was very nice to us and happy to help. But it just didn't make up for the gross atmosphere. I mean really.... really... nasty. How they are not violating health code beats me. \n\nChampaign Urbana doesn't have a real donut shop. This just doesn't count. \n\nSorry. Clean up your act and I'll try again.
