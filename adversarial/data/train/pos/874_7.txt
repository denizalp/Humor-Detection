Ohhh I knew I was in big trouble when I stepped in this place! Their showcase is packed full of different and unique sweet treats to choose from. Only place I know that has a killer Pistachio Cheesecake that's so dreamy rich.  Their Princess Cake is a first for me as well. Inside the filling is a whipped cream, custard, rum and raspberry jam and it's icing is  a thick layer of green marzipan. It tastes H E A V E N L Y! ...and St Benar! Ready for this?? Macaroon soaked in rum with mousse filling covered with a layer of ganache! I'm told they sell fast so maybe get there earlier in the day.  There is  also good bargains on day old bakery goodies bagged up against the wall there. \n\nThey have a variety of fresh baked bread there too, but since I skip out on eating breads I dont know how they are, but from the baked bread smell that emanates from them, Im betting it's very good as well. \n\nThe ladies who work there are helpful and cool! The \"Sexy People Tip\" tip jar made me laugh. \n\nI wouldn't had found this place it were not for the bakery sign they have out on the sidewalk and the recommendation I got from talking with the owner from Islanders Grill. Thank goodness for local businesses that support each other. Lots of hidden gems in the Water St. Dist.
