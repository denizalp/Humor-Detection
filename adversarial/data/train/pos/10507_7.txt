There's a feeling I get when I walk around Town Square; it's like for a brief moment I forget that I'm in Vegas. I pretend that I'm in my own little town where I can shop and eat and just enjoy the day because there's everything here... Whole Foods, Apple store, Sephora, The Container Store, Rave theater, and many more stores and restaurants.\n\nIt does get super hot walking around here in the summer time so I usually come when the weather is nice and cool. There's plenty of parking from open lots to garages. And directories pointing you to the right direction.
