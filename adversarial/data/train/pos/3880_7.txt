This place is kinda gross. Look, I'm not a prude but I don't necessarily want to watch every single cocktail waitress walk around in a thong and I'm kind of sick of go-go dancers in teddys EVERYWHERE in this casino. The clientele are a bunch of creepy older men who stare at the dancers and waitresses while they sip their drinks- and then they try to hit on the women at the bar (my friends and me). Um NO. \nThere is pretty much nothing redeemable about this place.No good restaurants, no entertaining shopping or shows (other than Penn and Tellar). I've had more fun at the Hooters casino than this place. At least Hooters has chicken wings!
