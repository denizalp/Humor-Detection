Sometimes the luck of the Irish in me comes in handy. On my most recent visit to Vegas I stayed, practically for free, at the Hilton Grand Vacations Club because my best friend's folks own a time share here. Thank you to the Myers family, hollah!\n\nThe suites can easily accommodate 2-4 people. They offer a full kitchen, big fridge, dishwasher and washer and dryer. The place is as luxurious or more than my usual favorite hotel, the Venetian. In particular I was crazy for the three nozzled shower wall! The pool is perfect for lounging, but not so perfect for scoping as the crowd was mixed between older timeshare types and random kids like us. One other important thing, even though it's more of a residence than hotel, the employees are very helpful and responsive. A technician fixed an evil beeping noise coming from the kitchen quickly (dishwasher, who'd've thunk?) and the concierge was an angel, guaranteeing entry for three GUYS into Jet after spending an hour on the phone.\n\nThe location is prime, on the strip and within walking distance to Circus Circus or Sahara. This actually comes in handy because cabs rarely show up here, so you're better off taking the 5 minute walk over to Clowns R Us to get a ride to your evening's destination.
