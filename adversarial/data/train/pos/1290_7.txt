Came here with my fellow Yelper Miss Lisa E, and very much enjoyed this upscale, fun, trendy restaurant.  Located within the W Hotel, makes a great spot for happy hour with friends, or a date night. The way the food is prepared, makes typically \"scary\" sushi a lot less intimidating for sushi rookies like me who don't typically eat things like octopus, eel, etc.  Everything I tried was quite delicious. I would suggest the fillet wrapped asparagus, and pretty much any of the rolls. The service was impeccable, its almost as if they knew we Yelpers, but seems like they are just that good! Looking forward to coming back.
