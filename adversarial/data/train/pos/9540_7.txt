Oh no. Sadly, this ended up being sushi I regretted purchasing. Located just south of Toronto St. and Adelaide St. East, I came by around 12:30 PM to quickly pick up a roll or some other eats for lunch. It was relatively busy, but not terribly so. I thought this would be a good spot to grab something without the notoriously long lines you'd find in the Financial District's food courts, but unfortunately, after having a taste of what I bought, I was better off with food court sushi, to be honest.\n\nI purchased a spicy salmon roll, which came to a little over $6.00. In terms and texture and taste, it felt like it was days old. The salmon wasn't fresh and the fish instead tasted almost... crunchy? It was very chewy and very difficult to eat. It was to the point that the fish tasted almost gamey. Not tasty at all, sadly.\n\nUnfortunately, I couldn't stomach the rest of the roll and could only eat about 4 pieces of the 8. Perhaps this was an anomaly as they have a number of other items on their menu (also note, this is mostly a takeout spot), but I'm not sure I'd come back, as there are a number of other (better) lunch options in the area.
