Knowing that A & W had a promotion going for the famous Teen Burgers I went to the Bathurst and Steeles Petro-Canada gas station.  Why the gas station you ask?  Well, the A & W is actually inside the gas station, with some tables in the station's convenience store.  But this time I did it DRIVE-THRU!\n\nPull up to the speaker and ask for the specials.  The lady gave me specials for the burgers with cheese.  I was looking to the drive-thru menu and did not see an ad for the Teen Burgers.  I asked her if there were any specials on the Teen Burgers and there was - only 3 bones!  I wonder why she didn't tell me earlier.  I ordered a Teen with a side of Onion Rings.\n\nPulled up, paid by credit card and received the bag of goodies.  The burger was great and the onion rings were phenomenal.  The burger was neatly placed and intact.  Yummy tasting and fresh, fresh, fresh.  I could do without the extra tomatoes but it's all good.  The onion rings were straight outta the fryer and were crisp and didn't break apart like other A & W places.  Crunchy and delicious.  The best things I liked about this place was that it was given fast (within 3 to 4 minutes) and again, the amount of freshness.  It was stellar.  Sometimes it's a hit or miss but this time, a HIT!
