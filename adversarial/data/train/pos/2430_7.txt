Cibo is located just NW of downtown Phoenix in a beautiful house with old trees all around it.  I highly recommend any of the porch seating under the trees - shade in the summer and heaters in the winter so it should be comfortable whenever you go. \n\nWe went on a Saturday night, it was an hour wait, but we grabbed beers at the bar and sat around the patio while we were updated via Yelp as to our place in line (a new feature for me!)\n\nWe started with the fried calamari and the burrata (cheese, tomatoes, prosciutto, and balsamic on toast) apps - very fresh and tasty - and then had two pizzas, a margherita pizza with the biggest basil leaves I'd ever seen, and an apple\/Gorgonzola\/walnut\/arugula pizza that we sweet and bitter and peppery and funky. We were very happy with our meal and can't wait to get back and try the pasta!
