In my book this is a yuppy place with over priced food. Yes, there's more depth to the atmosphere compared to the rather pubish original location but somehow it seems their beers are more expensive (probably not true, but that's the feeling I get). I'll go back after kayaking downtown but I wont drive to the place.
