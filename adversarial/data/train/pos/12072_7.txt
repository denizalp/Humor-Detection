Here's the thing:  the quality of the food at Eleven is really good but I just don't like the menu.   As a result, they are only getting 3 stars instead of 4.  I'd also like to add that this is based on lunch only.  I've never ventured here for dinner.\n\nLet's start with what I love: their Riesling, the soup specials, and the sample cookie that comes with the bill (and well their desserts, in general).   I happen to love a creamy, pureed soup.  The fewer chunks in my soup, the better.  And they have some tasty pureed soups.   They do change them fairly frequently and last fall, they had a butternut squash soup that was excellent.   Also, with your bill, they always bring you out a mini-cookie.   I love this.   I get a sweet without feeling overly indulgent.  That's not to say that I haven't sampled their chocolate-peanut-pretzel candy bar, which is awesome.\n\nWhat I don't love is the entrees on the lunch menu.  Since I don't eat any red meat, my sandwich options here are limited.  I hear they have one of the best burgers in Pgh but not my cup of tea.   The lobster roll is good but not great and I'd say the same with the crab cake.  Some of the lunch meals seem so large and heavy and I just wish they would offer a lighter vegetarian fare.   Would a gourmet grill cheese be out of the question?!  I'm perfectly content to order the soup and the three greens salad when going here but sometimes that just gets old.   More options, please!
