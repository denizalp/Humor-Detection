I wouldn't recommend this place to my neighbor who I can't stand. We dropped our dog off the first time and it cost $40 because she was shedding badly, and matted. This time, we said, \"just the $25 service please\" and pointed I the board. She said that was fine, so we left her. When I went back to pick her up she charged $40. She pointed to the sign and said \"it says $25+\". But $40 for a 45lb dog?  My dog wasn't nearly as matted as the first time when we paid $40. As the icing on the cake, I said, \"fine. Here's your $40. Can I have my dog please?\"  As I reached for the leash, the guy had the nerve to pull back and not let me have her until he could justify his overcharge. I didn't want to hear his reason. I paid his overcharged price and wanted to go, but he wouldn't give me the leash! GIVE ME MY DOG BACK! YOU GOT YOUR $40!  Not only am I disappointed with the customer service, but they don't seem to treat the dogs very nicely either. If you do go, don't let them spray whatever chemical \"blueberry\" stuff they call a blueberry facial on your dog.  It stinks, and lasts for weeks. I will never bring ours back here. One star because I can't give zero.\n\nUpdate: thanks for your insulting comment to my honest review, suggesting I need glasses, business owner. I think you need to go to business school. You have no concept of customer service. I am guessing by your accent that you might not be from America. I don't mean this as an insult, and welcome you to our country. The \"bait and switch\" is what we call what you did, here in the USA. Yes. I used the \"F word\" as in \"Give me my F-ing dog back right this instant!\" when you REFUSED to hand me my dog over. You do NOT get to hold my dog hostage for any reason whatsoever. I paid your bait and switch pricing. Your girl at the front quoted my girlfriend $25, and you did not honor it. Period. End of story. For you to insult me in your reply is petty and telling. You won't last in Anthem. Customers here have a higher standard.
