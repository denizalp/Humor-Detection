This is the very first time I have ever been in here.This location anyway, the first one was in downtown Seattle. \n Yes, I came with my girlfriend. Both times,but it is a cool place for men as well.\nSamples of colonge, creams ,lotions and anything else you have ever wanted to try. \nThey will even give you samples of things to take home. They will make you a sample of anything you would like to try.\nIt can be challange to get inside the Scottsdale Mall at times.\nBut, on this day it was not too bad,(during the week) and early in the day.\nIt is a cool place,with lots to see and try. Loads of people wanting to help you as well.
