I'm beyond sad to write this review. This used to be my go-to place to introduce friends to Cantonese food for 5+ years. Salt bake pork chop was my favorite, along with Spicy shrimp, wood ear mushroom and melon, shrimps and bitter melon; and the earnest and chatty owner and his staff.\n\nThat is until the change of ownership about 2-3 years ago. \n\nAfter the new owner took over, I come back to check in every once in a while to see if things turned around. No, the food has never recovered to its previous glory.\n\nTake spicy fried shrimps for example. There is too much breading. The shrimps were 3 times bigger in the previous version, and the breading was very light. You want to taste the shrimps, not the breading.\n\nSalt bake pork chop - all you taste is the fry breading. Where's the pork?\n\nIf you've never been here under the previous owner, I suppose you don't know what you are missing. It's like a Tribute Band to a rock star who passed away - they can imitate, but they are not as good as the original.
