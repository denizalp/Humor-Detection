Would actually be zero stars...Why is finding a trusted source to repair things I know nothing about without rippin' me off so damn challenging? Must I truly resign myself to depending on my husband for all things technical?\n\nI don't live in Phoenix - but own a condo with a tenant there. The temp control gauge in the fridge needed to be repaired, upon finding this company in Craigslist - we arranged for Eddie to go out there. After poking around with his screwdriver for 2 minutes - he tells my tenant it'll be $280. WTF???? That's almost the same price as a brand new fridge!\n\nWhat sucks is I'm out $65 because that's their \"trip charge\" - I'd say that's a pretty good gig - charge $65 and then give some crazy estimate that no one in their right mind would accept. Stay away from these unethical, unlicensed techs. After I asked the hubby for help - he found someone who took care of our problem for $120.
