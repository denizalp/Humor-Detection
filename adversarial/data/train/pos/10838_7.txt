I was craving some ramen so i decided to use yelp for a close spot near my house in silverado ranch area. This one popped up and has decent reviews so i decided to try this place out. \nUpon entering the waitress at the front was very sweet, polite and friendly! She sat me at a table and came back shortly after. I ordered a hot tea... and unfortunately it was tea with a tea bag.. it tasted ok but would prefer a matcha type tea you get at traditional japanese restaurants or a more flavorful tea. It was light and tasted ok.. something i can make at home. \nSo for starters i ordered the japanese style short ribs around $6... presentation wise it looked tasty.. but upon eating it.. it lacked flavor!! I guess Im used to the korean style short ribs that has a stronger flavor. I don't think I would ever order this dish again.  I also ordered the pork bun around $3 each. The bun was soft and tasty but I'm sure its a pre made one anyone can buy. They have a THINLY sliced char siu pork in the middle with a shred of lettuce with it. Again i was disappointed cause the pork was dry ...and i guess i was expecting a more moist pork belly type of meat in the middle.. I've never had a pork bun with such a small amount of meat. I would PASS on this one as well... \nOkay so the char siu ramen ($12) came out and it looks very pleasing.. it was hot enough.. and the egg was yummy! the pork meat was super thin and DRY as the desert...the broth was tasty enough and noodles were chewy enough.  Ive had many many bowls of ramen in my lifetime and this one because of the meat I won't order again. I prefer my meat a thicker cut, moist and tender! \nOverall I don't think I would come back...I think I rather take the longer drive into china town and order a bowl of ramen that will blow me away! Yes this place is much closer to my house.... but I was not impressed with this place. I honestly really really wanted to like this place cause its so close to me... but Im not a fan.
