A friend of mine invited me to this place or else I wouldn't have known about it!\n\nIt's such a cute place, with pictures of the Sicilian coast and different US cities.\n\nThis review is for lunch only although I can't wait to come back for dinner. \n\nThey start you with fresh, warm homemade bread and butter. Our serve Laura was EXCELLENT! Her attention to detail and service was second to none.\nI am a lover of gnocchi and I try it wherever I go. I prefer very tender melt in your mouth gnocchi however this one was a bit firm. It was superb! I requested to substitute with Alfredo sauce instead of the red sauce. It was yummmy, served piping hot! \n\nFor dessert I couldn't pick between cannolis, Tiramisu or Creme brûlée. Guess what? It was my bday so I tried all 3!!! \nTiramisu was excellent! The cannoli and cream brûlée cream was a tad sweet for me, but they were both awesome!\nCan't wait to return!
