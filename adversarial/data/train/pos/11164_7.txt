I really enjoyed my first visit to this drinking establishment, not quite a Japanese speakeasy but certainly reminiscent of one. Upon passing through the curtained off front entrance, we sat at a tiny knee-height table in a darkened room. Using candles and my phone to read the drink and food menus, we made our orders. Luckily there was an opening at the bar so we were able to move over there which allowed us more room and I was able to watch the bartender (Nick) expertly concocting various cocktails. I sipped on the Saigo Takamori (recommended if you like sweet drinks) and had the Salmon Donburi with salmon sashimi, a tartare and ikura. The food was good, but the cocktails were better. If you have an opportunity to visit make sure to try to grab a stool where the action is happening.
