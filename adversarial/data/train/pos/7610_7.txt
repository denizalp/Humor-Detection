Our concierge recommended it to us and we loved it. Long wait (Saturday brunch around 2PM and waited a good 40 min) but really enjoyed our meals and treats! \nWe split the healthy salad and egg in your face panini, both I would order again. The service was good, they seemed to have an overflow of hands on staff which never left you waiting for a refill etc. \nI didn't love my citron scone but truthfully it was a random choice for me, my BF loved his maple pecan brioche. Latte was mediocre. \nWould highly recommend a wknd brunch here!
