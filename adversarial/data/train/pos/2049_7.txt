Remember that time you finished driving across the country to arrive in your new home, Las Vegas, and you were so SO hungry. All you wanted was a whole chicken! To share with your friends in your new house that they had spent days furnishing for you! \n\nYou pull up to Peru Chicken, around 7:30\/8pm, plenty of time before closing! \n\n\"I'm sorry, we do not have any whole chicken left. Would you like something else?\"\n\"How about a half chicken?\"\n\"We have chicken breast left.\"\n\"How many chicken breasts?\"\n\"One.\"\n\nGet out of town. \n\nPeru Chicken ran out of chicken over an hour before closing. Judging by other reviews, the food here is good. But the reliability, of their feature item? Buzzkill. Two stars, won't be back.
