I love Unity.  I drive 40 miles every Sunday.   I love Richard Maraj.  He is wonderful.  I also have been going long enough to know the previous Minister Richard Rogers.  Everyone was so sad when he left.  But he is back now.  So we have both Richards.  It is so incredible.  Richard Rogers does the Wednesday evening service.  And brings back his passion for each message.\nIf you are looking for a church filled with love and the teachings of a loving God, then come home to Unity.\nAnd yes, the gift shop is amazing!
