Cooking school upstairs. Check.\n\nNeed some cupcakes? CHECK CHECK CHECK.\n\nNeed a wall of cheese to spend hours looking at, and reminiscing about days when you had never even heard of \"Lactose Intolerant?\" Check! \n\nNeed some alcohol to wash away the pain of not being able to go full on at the cheese wall? CHECK!\n\nNeed some new clothes cause you made a mess? Check!\n\n\nThis place has it all under one roof.\n\nI come here like weekly because it's so close to my friends place, and I can buy my bombay and then go buy my tonic too, in the same place.\n\n\nThe decor here is fantastic. I just want to spend hours and hours and hours here. \n\nLoblaws UYE...?\n\nSide Notes:\n\n1. Hit the tea emporium first, so you have something to sip on while you mingle around here.\n\n2.
