We stopped in for the lunch 6.95 lunch specials, and we're pleased with our meals.\n\nUnlike the other thai places we have reviewed, this restaurants food was very authentic. The staff was very friendly and accommodating. The decor was rather old, and a bit plain but that's not necessarily a bad thing.  The location is a bit on the rough side, having all of the automotive shops and smoke shops don't really help either.\n\nI ordered the red vegetable curry lunch special, 4\/5 spice, with a Thai coffee on the side. The meal started with a small cup of eggdrop soup, It was delicious. The spice level for the curry was a little on the hot side but that's how I like my curry. I was surprised that they included peppers in the curry that for me is what made the meal better than the rest. There was also an egg roll and salad included. I was kind of hoping they made their own dressing for the salad but it was ranch, which I like anyway. \n\nI would recommend stopping down here and checking it out! The food is delicious!
