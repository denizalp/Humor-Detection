We had our joint birthday dinner here with some friends in Vegas and we all thoroughly enjoyed our visit. SUSHISAMBA offers a cool blend of Japanese, Brazilian and Peruvian cuisine. The sushi rolls\/pieces were good, but I have to say, the cooked dishes were what really stole the show. The pork belly, miso glazed sea bass, wagyu beef gyoza, rock shrimp tempura, duck breast, Peruvian corn, etc., were fantastic. Our server was great about offering solid recommendations and he ensured that the portions were large enough for each of us to have a taste (we ordered a lot of tapas-style small plates and some large plates).\n\nAt the end of our meal, our server brought the birthday boy and me a cake lollipop on a \"Happy Birthday\" decorated plate, which was a nice surprise and quite delish. He's not big on chocolate but he ate it anyway. Bummer for me because I could have easily eaten his also. We left feeling satisfied and we really enjoyed our selections. \n\nThis is a great place to kick back and enjoy a nice dinner with a date or with some friends. We will revisit when we return to Sin City!
