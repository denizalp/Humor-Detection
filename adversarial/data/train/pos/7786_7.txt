As the Camelback Corridor Burger Wars escalate it is becoming more and more difficult to stand out from the pack.  Grind makes a great claim for originality by putting water cress, candied jalapenos, and ratatouille on one of their burgers.  Is this originality a good fit (think Mick Jagger) or is it just weird? (think Lady Gaga) I'm not sure.  I liked my burger although I don't think that the water cress added much other than being a new garnish to flout.  The sweet potato fritters were decent, but not enough to make me want them over their cousins, the sweet potato fry.\n\nGood vibe and probably a good place to catch sports....especially if you are into following five games simultaneously.
