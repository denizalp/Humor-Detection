XS is by far the prettiest club I have been to in Vegas.  Encore, you have outdone yourself.\n\nMaybe I'm just mesmerized by the pool area.\nSeats in the pool?  Check\nPatio seating?  Check\nBedding outside?  Check.  Though not that comfortable.\nHeat lamps!  Check.\nOutdoor blackjack area?  Check.  Note: if you don't want to pay for drinks and am a gambler, just stay a while at the blackjack area to get a free drink instead.\n\nThe only minus is that the DJ sucks.  S\/he does not know how to spin and get the crowd into it.  We didn't end up dancing much because of that, which may be a good thing considering the amount of eye candy there...(not much).\n\nThe lines are insane.  Girls are lucky to get in for free.  Guys, be prepared to shell out that $30.
