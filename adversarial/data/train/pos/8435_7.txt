I hate to be the Debbie Downer raining on this parade, but I don't understand the hype surrounding Presto's. The bakery itself is small and bare. There's only 3 tables and a few bar stools inside. I think they're striving to be more to-go based than be a dine-in restaurant (especially with the roll out of their take-home pizza menu). \n\nPresto's was freezing. The bubbly employee apologized and explained that the heater was broken. After ordering our food, two men stood next to our table discussing the heater problem and fire alarm implications. Kind of awkard. \n\nAs mentioned before in another review, the menu is limited, although it is expanding. Calzones are $6. There's only 2 vegetarian options: 1) a plain 'ol cheese and marinara calzone; 2) the garlic and parmesan calzone, which is filled with mushrooms, spinach, cheese, and white sauce. I wasn't ecstatic with my options, but I went with option #2. I added a side of marinara for an extra buck. \n\nIt took about 20 minutes to get our order. BTW we were the only ones there. As least we got to sip on the best Italian soda ever while we waited. Seriously, Presto's custom made Italian soda deserves a beverage award. The soda was the highlight of our visit. $2 is a bargain for a cup of Presto's magical  soda. And there's 30 flavors to choose from! I went with lime - I'd definitely recommend it.\n\nBut I digress. You can't visit a calzone bakery just for the soda. The calzones are small, but for $6, you have to assume they're going to be small. My garlic parmesan calzone was alright, not epic but not horrible either. My favorite part was the crust. To my dismay, there was just the slightest bit of onions in the calzone. There was no mention of onions on the menu, so I didn't expect there to be any in my calzone. Those little crunchy clear bastard onions are the bane of my existence!!\n\nStill hungry, the Mister and I started working on the German chocolate cake we had ordered ($3). The coconut frosting on top lacked the ooey gooey factor and the cake was dry. I wish it was sweeter too. Ugh. We ate about half of it, and called it quits (and it wasn't because we were full!). \n\nHere's the short and simple version :\nAtmosphere : 2\nItalian soda : 5+\nCustomer service : 4\nGarlic parmesan calzone : 3.5\nGerman chocolate cake : 1\n\nPRO TIP: They're on restaurant.com!\n\nWorth a return visit? Probably not, at least for now. \nWhat would make me like Presto's better? A calzone more enticing to vegetarians. Like one with olives, bell peppers, mushrooms, lots of cheese, and marinara sauce.  Basically more veggies. Also, a more decorated and exciting layout would help. With color.\n\nYELP 100 CHALLENGE 2015: #01
