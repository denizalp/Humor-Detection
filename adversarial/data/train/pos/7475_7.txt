Finally went to this shop after years of watching the show. It is much smaller than you would expect with not much to really look at inside. I wouldnt leave the strip to visit this shop as there really isn't much to browse at all.\n\nThe allure of the show is in part from how knowledgable all the staff is. This isn't the case when I visited the shop. I asked about items and they didn't seem to know anything about them at all. \n\nI also wanted to have some fun and get a price on my Rolex. I just wanted to somewhat experience the pawn process. They proceeded to scratch up my watch when trying to take off the band. They had no respect for my property whatsoever. After that they just went on Chrono24 (respected watch marketplace) and told me they would give me 33% of a similar women's model. So first, you scratch up my property to try and find the model number. And second you can't even tell the difference between a woman's and men's model of a very popular Rolex? And another employee stepped in and said I didn't know the difference between a men's and women's watch lol. \n\nJust an unpleasant experience overall. \n\nId stay away. I wish I never went and had my watch  destroyed. Not the experience anyone would expect from watching the show.
