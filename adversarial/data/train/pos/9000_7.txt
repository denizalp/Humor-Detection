I feel bad for the people who get suckered into this place after seeing their photoshopped pictures online.  This place is on par with a Days Inn, and is by no means a resort.\n\nMy issue was the ownership and staff.  If you want to feel like you are the biggest inconvenience to walk through the front door, then this is your place! Also, I have no idea how their gym survives. They discourage gym-only membership and the fees are ridiculous ($549 initiation fee, plus $100 monthly fee).  I guess that's why the place is completely dead. Oh well, the equipment is old anyways.  \n\nAnyways, this place is a big NOPE! Nope nope nope
