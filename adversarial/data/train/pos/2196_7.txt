I can't  believe no one has written a review of this place yet. You can't spit in a quality Cleveland-area restaurant without hitting a dollup of Lake Erie Creamery chevre.\n\nAnyhow, the reason I wanted to post something is, as excellent as their chevre is, they also produce this semi-soft cheese called blomma which is even better. It's creamy and complex and pungent and so freakin' good. It destroys all other Ohio cheeses, and I think it belongs in the same company of some of the best U.S. artisan cheeses around . Humboldt Fog, Pleasant Ridge Reserve, Purple Haze...the blomma is every bit as good as these. It can be maddeningly hard to find, but it's worth tracking it down. (Check out http:\/\/www.lakeeriecreamery.com\/ for their retail locations.)\n\n****\nThere also used to be this solo German- or Austrian-accented guy who used to sell these wild-ass cave-ripened cheeses around here. (Cave-ripened smethe, I think he called it....probably a German word for \"smells like gym socks.\") He just disappeared from the farmer's markets one day without explanation. If anyone knows who he was and if he's still in business, drop me a message. Goddamn if that guy didn't ever produce some glorious stink.
