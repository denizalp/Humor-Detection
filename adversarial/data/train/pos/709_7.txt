I scanned the reviews before our visit (of course). If you are like me you'll notice there are a lot of five star reviews for this eatery... and a smattering of somewhat scathing reviews.\n\nAfter experiencing Il Mulino for myself  - I  re scanned the reviews for my own edification - to better understand what the two-star-and-below crowd could have possibly been pissed about this place. \n\nAfter reading their complaints, I happened to notice the percentage of \"bad\" reviews in the mix roughly mirrors the average percentage of those among us in society who are, sadly, diagnosed as having a mental illness.  So if I were you, listen to the glass half full gang on this one. \n\nI could go on and on about why I believe this place deserves high acclaim. \n\nService was impeccable...they held our table for us during prime time on a Saturday night cheerfully while we tracked down a drunken poker renegade in our party. Then it was game on - It was flight of the server bumblebees the whole meal. Never waiting, never lacking. Yet we weren't smothered. Il mulino, you are the perfect girlfriend.\n\n The ambiance was elegant and intimate without being pretentious. The food...well... You can't go wrong. From apps to the ridiculous tiramisu - made and served to you with a commitment to food excellence.\n\nWe will be back.
