I don't own a Betsey number because I usually end up being overly practical, thinking, \"But where would I wear this?\" However, I came darn close to making a purchase at today's buy one, get one free sale. (I know! What a steal!) During the process I learned that the ladies here are total sweethearts. I must have tried on 15 dresses, but they never tired of helping me find sizes and making suggestions. They made a noble attempt to understand what I liked from cut to color. They asked all the right questions and delivered every new dress with a smile. Alas, nothing stole my heart. My one minor complaint about this store is that the dressing rooms are tiny and without mirrors. You have to emerge totally unaware of what you may look like to catch a glimpse in the mirror. This can be embarrassing! Even so, the charming lasses that helped me ensure that I will never hesitate to stop in and try on a thing or two!
