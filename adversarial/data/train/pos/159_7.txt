My friends who live in Vegas recommended us to eat here, and I urge you to try it if you haven't. Shout out to the chefs who cooked up our meal and did not keep us waiting for long. We were hungry, we came thirsty for some dos X cocktails, and we did not get let down. \n\nWe brought a big crew with us and gave warning a few days before. When we arrived, on the roof of Pinches, they'd put a table together to seat all 13 of us. \n\nI stood at the front of the line and got each member of the group to tell the cashier their order; she was patient, friendly and a lot of fun. Same with the chefs; whilst I waited for people to decide what food they wanted to order (we all got the three combination taco plate, some couldn't decide what mix of tacos they wanted), I joked around with them in Spanish - they were good sports and were really focused in delivering for us.\n\nEnd result? 13 happy out of towners who got served in the best way possible. Food comas all round. I highly recommend the Chilaquiles!!!
