We weren't happy with our initial dining experience there and wrote about it (see my last review). To our surprise, one of the Gordon Ramsay Steak managers contacted us soon thereafter to invite us back for another dining experience, promising to make things right.  Challenge accepted! \n\nFor appetizer, we got complementary scotch eggs that were lightly battered and deep fried; when we cut inside, the egg yolk was still running! yum! \n\nWe also ordered oysters and clams, yeah yeah yeah, i know it's a steak house but we felt like having some shellfish for the night. They had a wide variety from the East to the West coast and were so fresh and full of favor! \n\nThe Wagyu beef slider was out of this world!  It was so juicy and perfectly cooked.  I can see myself coming back here and ordering 5 of them at the same time! Pork belly was oh so crispy on the skin side with perfect layering of fat on the inside it literally melted in our mouths with the first bite! \n \nThe Rib cap and the bone-in ribeye were some of the best steaks we have ever had! For sides, we had bone marrow & shitaki mushrooms, however, the bone marrow was a bit too gamy for our taste and i wouldn't recommend it. I had tried bone marrow before at Animal restaurant in LA and it wasn't gamy at all. The shitaki mushroom was on point though.\n\nOur server, Matthew, also one of their managers, oversaw our entire dinner, and his professionalism was beyond reproach. This time Gordon Ramsay Steak redeemed itself and was deserving of the namesake.  We have many family members and friends visiting from out-of-town year round. As hosts, we wanna be able to impress them with the best dining experience Las Vegas has to offer, and I think I can finally count on GRS to provide a boat load of it.
