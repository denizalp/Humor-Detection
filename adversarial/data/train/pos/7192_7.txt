Once the jewel of the strip, the Bellagio is in need of a makeover.  The water show is always a draw, but there is definitely room for improvement there.  There's always a risk involved when it comes to remodeling.  When you're talking about Vegas casino's, then the risk is even greater.  \n\nThere are already 3 Italian-themed casinos on the strip (Venetian, Palazzo, Caesar's), so a renovation will be tricky.  Which way should they go?  Do they go the palacial route like Venetian, or old world like Caesar's?\n\nI can't even begin with which way to go.\n\nBut what I do know is that the interior hasn't changed since the Ocean's 11 remake and the clock is ticking.\n\nAs far as the hotel staff go, they are as accommodating as you'd expect at a high-end resort like this.  The buffet is definitely one of the best in LV, but also one of the most expensive.\n\nEverything about the interior says \"rich, older guy\" and I like it, but I'm not like most.\n\nChange is imminent...
