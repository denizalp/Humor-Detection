Dr. Wellish did an excellent job on my eyes. Very friendly, knowledgeable, and patient; he's an excellent doctor. If I had to do it over, I'd still use Dr. Wellish. \n\nBut I have a warning: If you don't qualify for LASIK, or you're right on the cusp, they'll suggest PRK to you. They'll tell you how there's slightly more discomfort than with LASIK, and the healing time is a little longer. While that's true, it doesn't tell the whole story. It's more the difference between getting a vasectomy (LASIK) and having an angry gorilla tear off your testicles (PRK.) The only sane solution when offered PRK is to say, \"I'll come back when I can afford the implantable contact lenses.\" Oh, and, with PRK, you won't be able to see jack shit for MONTHS. LASIK or implantable contact lenses - don't do PRK.\n\nOther than that, they're awesome.
