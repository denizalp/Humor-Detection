I'm a bit of a whore for cupcakes, so I was bound to love this place. 'A bad cupcake is still a cupcake' will be written on my grave.\n\nThese guys lose points only for lack of flavours as far as I'm concerned. They had chocolate on chocolate, chocolate with raspberry frosting, vanilla on vanilla, mocha, and carrot cake. We got one of each (three for me, two for my boyfriend -- om nom!). I loved all of mine. Raspberry chocolate was the winner, followed by chocolate and then the staple vanilla. My boyfriend tells me the carrot cake was good, but he wasn't wild about the mocha as the coffee frosting was too mild. I don't like to share, so he can't comment on any of mine.\n\nPricewise, it's under three dollars per cupcake. I'll go back again to see if they have new flavours. If yes, I'll be a regular, if not, I'll probably only go there when I happen to be in the area.
