If you like steak and are prepared to spend a nice sum of money one one you will remember for a very long time, then check out this restaurant in a swanky historical (and haunted) Victorian Mansion. \n\nAt my most recent meal here at one point I felt the steak I was eating was too good for me. But I kept quiet and pretended otherwise.
