The Hawthorn Suites is a nice hotel I confess I was very tired after spending the day at the Consumer Electronics show in Las Vegas, and quite full after a wonderful Cuban dinner, so when i got to the hotel I checked in drove around to the back entrance (my room was at the end of the hall) an not to long after that was out! So the rooms are nice and spacious. The little refridgerator is nice. The flat screen was only about a 32, adequate. The Hotel seems rather new and very clean. Seems like a good neighborhood, and I would use it again. The breakfast included was the standard fare. I did like the full sized bagels and for some reason the juice was better than most other hotels. Thanks Hawthorn hope to see you again soon.
