Terrible service when we went in and it's wasn't even that busy! I wish we could've stayed and actually played the games. The bartender was so grumpy and rude. Didn't acknowledge we were there for a while then when we asked to try something she didn't answer back and walked away, I would give it another shot if I actually got a drink! A couple walked up after us and got their drinks refilled
