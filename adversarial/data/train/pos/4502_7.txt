Good enough for an all you can eat.   Slow service (ordering tempura is impossible).  Pricing is on par with other similar places.   Today, I received a long hair wound though my hand roll.  Not sure how they missed it as it was sticking about an inch out of the bottom.  I asked the waitress to tell the manger - which resulted in a lame 10% off my meal.  It's the first time it's happened to me here (we've been about 4 other times) but I would expect to be compensated for my meal.  \nIt's not that great to deal with hair in the food and below standard service.
