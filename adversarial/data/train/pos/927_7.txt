Located in Downtown Las Vegas. So there is no shortage of event space in  Las Vegas, that being said, I am not entirely sure what to make of this place, sure it's a nice venue, in one of the worst neighborhoods in Las Vegas with no parking (that is the only reason for a two star rating) (do you really want to get dressed up and walk at night thru the drug dealers and degenerates to get back to your car? The website leaves little something to be desired as well. If they fix the parking thing, they may ahem something here, but if not...every hotel in Las Vegas has ample event space.
