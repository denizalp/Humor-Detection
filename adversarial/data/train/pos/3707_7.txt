Rock of Ages definitely entertains at the Rio!\n\nI didn't see the movie so I didn't know what to expect.  Here's what is in store: classic rock tunes, love story line and some comedy.  This show was fun and entertaining. The cast had the entire audience singing along.  \n\nThe show does have a brief 15 minute intermission for restroom or drink breaks.  The restrooms are located out of the theater but there is a bar inside.  \n\nThanks for a fun night of laughter and memories.
