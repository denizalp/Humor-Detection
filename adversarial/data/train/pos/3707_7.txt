You can take the girl out of California, but you can't take the California Burrito love out of the girl. \n\nThere are Roberto's all over, but this spot is right near my house. I'm on the way fence whether this is a good thing. The location is across from UNLV so it gets busy quickly. There is a parking lot, which is nice, and cars are constantly coming and going. \n\nThe woman behind the counter is a beast. She moves quickly and gets your order in fast. The foods takes a bit, seemed like there may have only been on person on the line, but it's decent. The tortillas are full of all the lard, so obviously they are delicious. The burrito itself was a bit dry, but it curved my craving for a bit. \n\nWednesday's they do chicken tacos for $1.40 something. Not a bad deal. Whether you're in college, or just need a deal, you will find yourself satisfied.
