How are there only two other people who have reviewed OGX? If you're reading this, and are doubting its popularity and validity because you often base your opinion on the quantity of Yelp reviews... well this is an anomaly. Constantly busy, constantly making awkward eye contact with other guys in mirrors, and consistently they seem satisfied. \n\nThink of your comfort food. Old reliable. What is it? KD? Salisbury Steak? Dad's Cinnamon Toast? El Paso Fajita Kit? That deep, nurturing feeling you get from your comfort food... that's the feeling I get when I walk into a barbershop knowing that I a) don't ever have to give that awkward explanation of how to cut my hair and b) don't ever have to deal with awkward non-conversation. If I can go through my life with reducing those 2 things down to less than a handful of times for the rest of my life, call me a pug in a kiddie pool chock full of KD. \n\nThanks to OGX and Nancy (yo!) I don't have to deal with a nor b and you can see me on the streets with a new cut every 4-6 weeks. \n\nBring cash to tip! \n\nP.S. Their committed to the community and keep Mo Bros clean all Movember long. They hosted a free shave off Movember event on Movember 1st. If you're right in the thick of raising your first ever top lip dust buster... they'll properly hot towel and straight razor shave your face for that proper mo to face distinction.
