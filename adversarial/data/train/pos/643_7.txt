Charm Thai is much better than Thai Gourmet and one of the only two options within a 5 mile radius for a Thai lunch. Charm Thai has high ceilings and is kind of a fancy interior for a strip mall. The menu is very similar to Thai Gourmet. They also offer sushi. The menu is somewhat limited and hosts the usual mainstays. My favorite lunch has been the Thai Basil Chicken. It is usually helpful to ask for the hot chili sauce if you like spicy food. The service was excellent and the people working there seemed to enjoy their jobs. Unlike the dudes at Thai Gourmet who seem like they are on their 19th nervous breakdown on each lunch rush. I wish some of the chaos from that restaurant would spill on down the road south to Charm Thai. It is a very peaceful and serene lunch getaway without all of the corporate chatter you have to deal with when dining at the lunch hour in Independence.
