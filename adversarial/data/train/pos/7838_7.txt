Happy to say this was my first poke burrito experience and it was delicious! They just opened this location yesterday and I was happy to try it out. The restaurant is a make-your-own style bowl or burrito, like Chipotle style. I opted for a burrito with spicy tuna and marinated tuna with spicy mayo and sesame shoyu. For toppings I added the spicy surimi, seaweed salad, corn, cucumber, and all the crunchies. Definitely add ALL the crunchy toppings- wontons, fried onions and sesame. It gives a much needed crunch to an otherwise all soft burrito or bowl. The burrito was full of flavor and not so huge or overwhelmingly that you'd feel sick. You could even split a burrito and get a side of miso soup if you aren't super hungry. The staff was super friendly and nice. Highly recommend this place for fresh poke!
