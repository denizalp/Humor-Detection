If you need a solid asskicking, Running Room will deliver it, and swiftly. Highly recommended is the 10K clinic led by Kerry, who will lightheartedly (but in all seriousness) tell you that \"you will love hills\" and \"hills are so good for you!\" But seriously: do hills. You'll hate every moment, but it's worth it in the end. \n\nIf you sign up for a clinic you'll run three times a week with the group (clinic night plus Wednesdays @ 6:30pm and Sundays @ 8:30am), and then more on your own, if you're up for it. Personally I was never really \"up for\" running at the ungodly hour of 8:30am (yes, a time of day exists where there are people watering their lawns and smiling maniacally like those fucks in Soundgarden's \"Black Hole Sun\" video; I've seen it), so I arranged group runs with other clinic participants later in the day. Whatever works.\n\nStore manager Rina is an absolute peach. She's easygoing, always smiling, and at the ready with a joke, pun or witticism to cut the whiny mood that's often present when there's inclement weather (which in Toronto is, um, always). She'll even run with your group from time to time and make sure there's no one lagging behind.\n\nWatch out for gnat swarms along the boardwalk at Ashbridges.
