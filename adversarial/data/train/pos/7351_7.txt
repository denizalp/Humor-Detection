This was my favorite Thai place in Phoenix. Don't be fooled by the semi-authentic (see: and streamlined) Thai Basil\/ Thai Rama chains--- Thai Hut, although not as nice looking as those places, has better food, better prices, and better service. A vast menu of mostly traditional Thai fare-- they lack the weirder stuff you'd find in Thai Town in LA and a lot of the soups and Boat Noodles, but for the most part, Thai Hut gets the job done. My most favorite thing on the menu is surprisingly their spring rolls. They're addicting and we always order two orders at a time. Good pad see ew, and decent pad thai. Great lunch specials and free parking! \n\nMy major gripe though: all the Thai places downtown are closed on Sundays. That could never fly here in LA.
