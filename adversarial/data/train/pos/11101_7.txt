What a fun day it was hanging out with Blazin' Paddles.  We met up at their Henderson location to sign the required release forms.  Then the owner Ryan drove us out to Willow Beach Marina in AZ.  He is super nice and friendly.\n  Once at Willow Beach we met up with our guide.  He was really nice and mentioned he had been working as a guide for several years.  We were wearing tennis shoes and luckily had time before launch to get some pool shoes at the Marina Store.  They were a pretty good deal so it all worked out.   We did have to step in the water a few times so they were a great purchase.\n   The Kayaks are nice and have a storage spot for your excess items you don't want to get wet.  We already had waterproof covers for our phones which I highly recommend.  Got them at Blazin' Paddles Office.  They were a better deal than Amazon - sweet!  I also recommend a hat, sunscreen and workout gloves.  \n  Our guide took us out and gave a few folks who never kayaked a lesson on how to do it.  Since Kayaking is not too hard to learn we were on our way up the Colorado River in no time.  Our first stop was at Emerald Cove which was busy due to another group.  Once it was our turn he guided us in so we could take it in and get our mandatory cool photos.  \n  We then left to go up the River for about an hour before stopping at a beach landing on the left side.  He then pulled out bottled water and lots of yummy snacks to replenish the calories we had burned.  We relaxed for 20 minutes or so before getting back into our Kayaks and heading back to the Marina.\n   We used a Yelp deal to help reduce the cost of the 1\/2 with Blazin' Paddles.  We had a great day on the River and look forward to another trip out with them.  Great local business and fantastic people!
