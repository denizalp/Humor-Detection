Whenever I'm in town visiting family, I stop by Bialy's Bagels.  These are the best bagels I have ever had.  They have been at this Silsby \/Warrensville  location since I was barely old enough to buy a salt bagel for 0.12, plus a can of \"pop\" for a quarter on my wintry walk home from a Saturday elementary school basketball game.  Their closest competitor, Amster's Bagels at Cedar Center (South Euclid), closed decades ago.  Even without competition, Bialy's hasn't slipped a notch!\n\nAs far as I am concerned, there are probably no bagels this good outside of New York City and its boroughs.  My fave flaves are \"Mish-Mosh\"  (garlic, onion, rye seed, salt, poppy), and single-item sesame and poppy.  This is a take out location with some soda, cream cheese and lox in the cooler, and little else, but nothing else is needed.
