So it was payday and I decided to treat myself to some overpriced cocktails and sushi.  My wallet was bleeding a little bit after this night but it was worth it because you can observe cougars (literally in animal prints) hunt their prey. Dinner and a show! \n\n OOO and not to mention there was a magician! YES, a magician at Nakama.  Hilarious. As far as magicians go, I guess he was good! It still kills me that Nakama and Max & Ermas have the same entertainment. \n\nService was a bit spotty. The place was packed but we still stay at the bar for 20 minutes sans cocktails. \n\nPro: Busy, Lively, good cocktail list, fresh sushi, good place to start the night\n\nCons: Slow service, pricey, strange amount of bachelorette parties (they has sashes and crowns) \n\nEvery once in awhile this place can be fun!
