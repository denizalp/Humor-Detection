Came here for dinner and ended up trying the green (mild sauce) enchilada dinner. In addition to enchiladas they have burritos, tacos and salad bowls. Corn and flour tortillas are made from scratch in-house in front of you - pretty cool. The corn tortillas used for my enchiladas were amazing. The green sauce (mild) was well seasoned and blended great with the shredded cheese and chicken. The rice was undercooked but I could tell it was seasoned just right. I got refried beans instead of black beans and they were cooked to perfection. They don't have refried beans here. Drink options are Coke products, different kinds of teas and Mexican Favorites like Horchata and Jamaica. \n\nI'll come back when I'm looking for a quick Mexican meal. Friendly and fast service.
