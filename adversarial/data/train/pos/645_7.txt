5 stars for the service with JAY. \nIf you can, sit in the bar and ask for jay. \nIf you can't sit in the bar - still ask for JAY and you won't be disappointed. \n\nThe kitchen can be slow but JAY delivers on expeditious, courteous and appropriate service. \n\nI don't love the chowder due the corn and the base\nbut the burgers made folks in my dining party excited. \nTried the 3 course with the 6oz sirloin @ 160degrees with augratin and fries. The fries have a little batter to them and crisp. The Au gratin was served with bread crumbs (which I personally never care for) yet the crumbs didn't distract. They kind of helped. Tasty and creamy. Dessert was as close to beignets as I've had in this town and I'd highly recommend. They are served two (2) to a plate with chocolate sauce and caramel sea salt. I'd prefer a cherry or raspberry but my word so flaky, so decadent, so PERFECT rolled in sugar (which I don't have to have). \n\nThe dumplings impressed the dining crowd as a burst of flavor. I'll try something else next time but I prefer Bang Bang shrimp without the sauce. Yeah! I said it. \n\nHappy HOur still in effect. Give it a try. Ask for Jay.
