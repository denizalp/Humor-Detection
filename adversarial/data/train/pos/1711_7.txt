Alta Vista Veterinary Hospital has been my goto vet for years, even after I moved out of the area and now have to drive a ways to get there. \n\nThey've got very reasonable and competitive prices, and the ABSOLUTE BEST HOURS of operation of any vet in the area. If you work regular weekday office hours, and need a weekday evening appointment, it can be impossible to find that anywhere, but Alta Vista has always been accommodating. \n\nMy experiences with Alta Vista began years ago when my best friend Gideon ( www.youtube.com\/watch?v=5iVlC0mKQ0k ) came into my life. Alta Vista is a sponsored vet that you can choose for your free initial checkup when you adopt through the Humane Society.  \n\nI've also been back for instances of illness, emergency injury, and routine surgery (neuter -- not me, one of the dogs), and they've been friendly and helpful each time. I do not at this time recall the names of individual vets I've seen, but they all seem genuine and knowledgeable.  I've only had Science Diet suggested to me lightly and then dropped, and any vet visitor knows what a pimp all vets are for that crap food.  One of the vets was even supportive and knowledgeable when I was asking questions pertaining to transitioning to a raw diet (  http:\/\/www.rawmeatybones.com\/  ).\n\nThe neuter surgery I visited for was also a freebie using one of the Maricopa County Big Fix Program vouchers ( http:\/\/www.maricopa.gov\/pets\/SpayNeuter\/voucher.aspx ).  I love that they participate in these programs which help the pet community. The voucher gave the surgery fee free, but not all the meds\/aftercare, and Alta Vista was not pushy at all when it came to my choosing what level of care, and therefore expense, I wished to incur beyond the free voucher's value. \n\nAlta Vista is a full service hospital and boarding facility as well.  I've not used the boarding facility services.  They've undergone a renovation, or actually, moved to a newer larger facility since my initial experiences.  The new facility is spacious and clean, both front and back office.  \n\n**It is unfortunate that sometimes folks have experiences with their loved ones that end tragically, but it is not fair to blame the medical professionals who try to help, even if they end up failing, no matter if your loved one was furry or not.
