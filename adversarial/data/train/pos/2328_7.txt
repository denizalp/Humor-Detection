Sometimes when I wake up too early for work I pick a new coffee shop to explore.\n\nDon't judge me.\n\nAnyways, Really liked this shop. Surprisingly, they had a drive through! I'm used to seeing big Chain coffee shops with drive thrus but never a cute, artsy, hole in the wall type shop like this before. *Insert clapping emoji*\n\nLoved all the artwork that was for sale, and in all honestly if I wasn't headed straight to work I probably would've bought a couple of the pieces.\n\nI got a blended Chocolate, Peanut Butter, Banana drink that was too die for. and I also got a scrambled egg, cheese and bacon croissant sandwich.\n\nEverything was very good, my only complaint was that halfway through eating my sandwich i noticed the eggs were grey in color and that kind of ruined my appetite. \n\nOver all I will definitely be returning even if only to buy some art pieces.
