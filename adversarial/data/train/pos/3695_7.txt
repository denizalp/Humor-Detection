Really really upset... the waiter was horrible! He spilled drinks and did not even apologize, just huffed and puffed cleaning it up. He ruined my new years eve meal... DO NOT ASSUME things mr. waiter. It happened one to many times that night to not post about it and to top it off I have called and left 2 messages for the owner or manager to call me back, nope nothing! I have given plenty of time so now here is my rant. It was a great meal (overpriced) but i would not go there again if they have that same offensive waiter! I will update later if I get a response or find out he is gone.
