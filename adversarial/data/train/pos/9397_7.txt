Meh. I was craving Hawaiian food and came here for dinner tonight to satisfy my craving. Immediately upon entering the store the woman working the cash register said \"to go?\" She didn't say hi or anything and when we told her for here she said \"we close at 9\" Ok great it's 8:23 that means I have 37 minutes to eat. Now I would understand if it was 853 but come on. I've been to other restaurants that have served customers up until the last minutes of closing. I understand you want to go home but your business is open until 9 so that means I should be able to get food until then. I'm not that person who goes into a restaurant 5 minutes before close anyway and I thought 823 was a reasonable time to eat considering I just got off work at 7.\n\nAnyways I ordered the loco moco plate which I've never had, and the bf ordered the bbq chicken plate. The loco moco was disappointing. The burger meat was not seasoned and the gravy was bland. The only thing I enjoyed was the mac salad I could just order that and be happy. The bbq chicken was just ok it's teriyaki chicken basically. \n\nI probably would go back because I love the curry chicken katsu and the bbq chicken saimin, but I'll get my order to go next time.
