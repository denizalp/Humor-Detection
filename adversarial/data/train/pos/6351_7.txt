Decisions.\nDecisions.\n\nThe Food: 4 stars\n\nThe service: 3 stars.\n\nDecisions.\n\nIf only I could do a three and a half star review!\n\nAs I said in my last review, I decided to try Pastavino again, but for dinner instead. I attended last Saturday night. The atmosphere was better during the evening, it was packed with faces that all looked happy, and I over heard a woman talking about Chef Marc's home cooking, I suppose they know each other. Everyone looked as if they had been dining at the same place every week for years! It was very cozy, and in fact while we were dining some of my family and family friends came in to dine! How funny is that?\n\nSo, my major problem with this place is the time it takes to get the food out. Every single course took far too long to get to our table, in my opinion.\n\nPs: I got bread this time! Lots of it! I believe, 3 baskets over the course of our time there? No oil and vinegar though, drat :\/.\n\nAppetizer:\nChef Marc came to our table and recommended the Scungilli Salad, and you know what? I do too! It was so, so, so, incredibly refreshing and light. A great way to start!  -$16.00\nWe also ordered the Escargo which, while good, wasn't my favorite way of having it. Oh well. -$9.00\n\nDinner:\nI enjoyed the Linguini and Clams, while my fellow diners enjoyed the Pork Chop and the Bolognese dinner.\n\nBUT before we enjoyed them, we waited. A good amount of time. It seemed a little hectic that night...Chef Marc came and cleared our table and called for his staff to get us new silverware...hmm. Chef, although your wait staff wasn't the best of the bunch that evening, the food was delicious!\n\nAfter dinner we tried the Tirimisu, and the Polenta cake. \n\nBUT before we could try it, we waited. \n\nEven,\n\nlonger.\n\nAND THEN! We stared at our desserts, as they were placed in front of us at a different table...we looked around wondering if that was ours...but waited some more.\n\nand then it came...\nand it was amazing. I loved the polenta cake so much! I'm dreaming about it right now...\n\nSooo, even though the service was...Eh. I AM a fan of the dinner at Pastavino. Would I go again.....aayyee, yes.\nAnd I'm hoping when I go again my review can become a four star or five star one.\n\n\nUntil then Pastavino...
