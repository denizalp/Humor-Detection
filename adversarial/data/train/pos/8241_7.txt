Unfortunately Yelp makes you leave at least 1 star. I've had major work done on my old vehicle at the Fletcher's on Cave Creek probably 3-5+ times and loved them. Not sure why there's such a difference in service between this location and that one (not to mention the stars), but in the 3 different interactions I had with the same person at the Bell location.. I'm honestly disgusted. Darren needs a MAJOR attitude adjustment and for that alone I would never recommend that location or take my business to any of their other locations. \n\nReally though.. 2 stars about sums that place up.
