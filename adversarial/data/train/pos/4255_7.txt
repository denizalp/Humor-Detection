You have to admit that a place of this size, with such a huge variety, is definitely worth the $10 for the lunch buffet. There are even many varieties of salads if you are a grains and roughage eater.\n\nThey break the cuisines into multiple food categories.  For my lunch day, the categories were Seafood, Magnolia, Chinese, barbecue American, Mexican, Italian and desserts. Within those different sections you also have specific salad varieties from that particular area. They even have an entire salad bar set on an island by itself was also fruit and soup included. The dessert bar has a variety of pre-sliced entities as well as fruit cobbler and bread pudding. They also have sugar-free desserts and gluten-free desserts. You can also ask them to give you a slice of dessert from out of the display case. If you are looking for gelato or ice cream, they have you covered on both ends. They also have ice cream cones and dessert toppings such as sprinkles and chocolate syrup.\n\nIf you are wondering if the food itself will blow you away, then that is truly on you and your taste buds.  One thing that I like about this place is that you cannot deny the value and variety offered.   If you get a \"B Connected\" card, which is free, you can get a discount on your buffet (normally a dollar off).
