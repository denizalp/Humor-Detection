One star, only because negative isn't a allowed. \n\nYou'll wait. A long time. \n\nThe staff is sweet and efficient, with broken smiles and trembling hands,  much like a beaten spouse. That's because the owner treats them similarly - talking down to them and correcting them in public. \n\nYou'll pay more than advertised. Staff works for slave wages and tips and is hungry. \n\nBrides: you will be sweating. Owner refuses to fix AC. \n\nSober people: you will notice just how disgusting, dirty and ill-repaired this place is. The bathroom door does not even close.\n\nFriends: The owner is anti-gay. She and her freak son (who is one of the ministers) will proudly tell you so. Employees who are \"outed\" are summarily fired. I witnessed this. \n\nVegas may be cheesy, but it's better than this.
