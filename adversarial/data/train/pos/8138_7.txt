George's Famous Gyros is located in a slightly ghetto strip mall next to a gas station, \"massage\" parlor, hole-in-the-wall Mexican food joint, and a mail box store. From the outside it may not look like much but upon entering the dark exterior you immediately find that this is quite the popular lunch spot! \n\nMy friend, Jillana, and I ventured into this hot spot at around 12:30pm on a Thursday. The tables were packed and there was already 6-7 people in line ahead of us. Despite the crowd our food was served in a matter of minutes and the owner, operating the cash register, noticed that we were new customers and offered up drinks on the house. A rarity for today's economy! The owner was extremely helpful and attentive (readily changed our order from din in to to-go and made sure we had plenty of napkins and plastic-ware before he sent us on our way). \n\nThe place itself is rather small but has a rather fun, lively lunch vibe to it. I always love the 80's posters of the attractive Greek bushy-eyebrowed brunette enjoying a big gyro :-) Not sure how busy it is around the dinner hour but it seems that this place will certainly not be going out of business anytime soon. \n\nMy friend and I both opted for the classic Greek gyro, costing only $7.30 after tax. Great prices! The sandwich was quite tasty. The meat was well seasoned, packed with flavor. The fries were quite good and my friend thoroughly enjoyed her Greek side salad. The only drawback was that the meat was a tad on the greasy side for my taste. However, this would not deter me from frequenting George's. Next time I would ask for extra tzatziki, there was some on the sandwich but I would have liked a bit more. Plus, I love dipping my fries in the rich creamy goodness as well. \n\nOverall, quite a good experience. Price, good. Service, good. Food, goooooood.
