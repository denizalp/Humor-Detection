On my way back from a memorable trip down Souff...I get to enjoy Charlotte Int'l for a bit. \nMany restaurants (both local and national), shops, kiosks, etc and other spots to drain a few extra bucks out of you while you're 'trapped' here.\n\nI do like the old school rocking chairs throughout the concourses. I like the charging stations everywhere as all the major airports have. I like the filtered  water refilling stations throughout. the airport as well.   I would LOVE a lil POS kiosk with some booze in it as well, so we can deal with the chatty passengers\/seat kicking kids\/loud talking mofo's that every flight seems to have.\n\nOverall a great layout, long walks to connecting flights, comfy chairs, nice and helpful employees.  Can't ask for much more.   Thumbs up
