I'm not a camper.  So when I was invited to go on a 4 day camping trip, I stopped by REI to help me out.\n\nThe sales staff here we extremely helpful.  Since I never camp, they suggested that I rent the equipment.  They set me up with a tent, sleeping bag, and pad.  It was perfect.  I paid for my equipment 2 months ahead of time, then picked it up the day before we left on our trip and returned it the day after I returned.  When you rent equipment, you only pay for the days of your trip, not for the pickup\/return days.\n\nBy renting instead of buying, I was able to save hundreds of dollars.\n\nThanks REI!\n\nReturn Factor - 100% If I go camping again...
