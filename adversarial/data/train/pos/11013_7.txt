I have been to Jean Philippe on several occasions and think they have some of the best croissants in town. On this occasion, I came in for a crepe. The crepe area was a complete mess. The ingredients were spilled all over the place, mint was browning, and raspberries appeared mushy. I brought this to the attention of the \"manager\" Duke and he said that it was not up to standard but he did not try to right his wrong by offering a solution. I left empty handed. For how empty Jean Philippe was I could not believe how untidy and unappetizing the crepe station was.
