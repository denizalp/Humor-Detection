Yikes! I feel sorry if you go to this place and they make you sit on one of their dumb footstools.  Otherwise this place is great!  Great food, shared a bowl of balls and the empanadas.  Mmm and a nice bottle of wine.   \n\nAgain, another old house converted into a restaurant in downtown Phoenix. Very nice!
