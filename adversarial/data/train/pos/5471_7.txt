Hmmmm...trying to think of anything positive to say about Cox Cable. Nope, can't think of it. We have had horrible customer service and when we went to cancel they would not let us choose a date until we returned the equipment. Weird. Usually you can cancel then return the equipment after or be charged for it. They tried to make it almost impossible to leave....very Twilight Zone. \n\nI guess the thing that bothers me the most is that they really do not care how long you have been a costomer of yours or even try to retain you. Their price has gone up every year as well while other companies have come down in price.\n\nOf course, after we cancelled our service they called and tried to offer us a better deal. Isn't that a little to little to late. Like bringing flowers home AFTER your wife moves out. Hahahahah!\n\nSorry Cox, had to kick you out - flowers or not....we just were not working out!
