This place is filled to the brim with the lustful eyes of women preying on their next dessert.\n\nI don't have a huge sweet tooth, but this place, just has this delightful quality that makes you want to swallow pounds of sugar!  \n\nI love that they have workers with adorable French accents.  \n\nIt's been almost a week since my visit and I'm still thinking about the decadent truffles.
