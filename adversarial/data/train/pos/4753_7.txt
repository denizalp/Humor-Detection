Too many negatives!\n\n1) Off the strip -  this is fine as long as there is shuttle.\n2) You are forced to pay a $16.80 \"Resort\" fee. This is fine if it included more amenities and a shuttle service that doesn't end at 5pm. Essentially, you are forced to drive to the strip or take taxis back, because 5pm is practically mid-day in Vegas.\n3) At checkin, we didn't get the room we reserved. We were lied to and switched to another room. That room was a smoking room with a nasty smell and scratches on the walls and doors -must have been a room Charlie Sheen used to frequent. Switched a third time and discovered the previous lobby clerk lied and there was a room available for us.\n4) Sportsbook (barely) - Discovered that sports betting only gives you a drink ticket for every $50 bet.\n5) 1 drink ticket only gets you a domestic beer or well drink, if you get a Stella or Amstel, they require 2 tickets! Yes, that's 1 Amstel light for 100$ in sports betting.\n6) Went to the Player's club to get a player's card. Was in line at 11:45pm, waited there 15 minutes before getting to the clerk. Once I got to her, I asked for a player's card. She then told me they were closed. I asked her what time they closed, she said 12AM. Then I asked what time was it, she said 12:01. She saw me there standing in line the whole time and only turned off the lights right before I approached. What the f$%k kind of customer service is this?\n7) They don't provide you with any lotion. It's a desert and the AC\/Heaters always dry you out even more.\n8) Got stuck in the cheek with a feather sticking out of the pillow...not a great way to wake up.\n9) All other things being equal, the rating depends on the value. If this was a cheap hotel, than such things are more acceptable. It is rated as a 4 star, more like a 3 star IMO. We paid around $120 per night over the Thanksgiving weekend.\n\nThings I liked.\n1) Decent music playing the entire time, didn't hear any Gaga, Katy Perry, Ke$ha, Bieber, Kanye, etc.\n2) Hot pole dancing girls in the casino.
