I've just started going to Parlour as my Stylist (Sam) has recently moved there (from John Steinberg). She's really the only person I trust in terms of skill-set, and abilities. So this is more about the change of venue, than Sam (see my JSA review of Sam) \n\nMy biggest issue with getting my haircut is generally the tone of the Salon. You either feel like you're under a microscope for your style sensibilities, and this is usually accompanied by a  \"Hipper than Thou Attitude\" mixed with a wee bit of condescension. \n\n I'm happy to say; Parlour isn't like that. The vibe is pretty relaxed and it feels like you're just hanging out at someone's house...albeit, a House inspired by 2001: A Space Odyssey. But the fireplace and couches add a nice touch of chilled ambiance. The bust of Jean-Luc Picard reinforces that they really don't take themselves too seriously.\n\n All-in-All, very refreshing and progressive change from a lot of other Salons where you feel like you're inconveniencing ~them~ if you're 5 minutes too early, 5 minutes too late. Also really like that I can book appointments online!
