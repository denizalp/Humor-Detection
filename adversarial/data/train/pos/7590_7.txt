So.........\n\ni was SO sadly disappointed today @ the Wynn Buffet.  It was my parents first time here and they hated me afterwerds.  Lunch was only $21.95  SUPER cheap.  However there wasn't much to eat.  They had turkey and Lamb which i both don't care much for and everything was so limited.   WHat thE HECK?!?!?! I guess you have to come here on a weekend for brunch to catch those delish strawberries and creme.  Plus WTF happened to the gelato?  They only had a few selection of icecream and the cupcake omg they display these huge mother effers and they offer this tiny not-even-a-damn-bite-size cupcakes...sad...they shouldn't even be called cupcakes. STILL the amazing brunch carries it to a 4star psh maybe one more time and I may restar it =)
