on the first day after arriving into vegas, we came here for lunch at the suggestion of the concierge at the hotel where we were staying. although it was a beautiful day we opted to seat inside and no wait. you still have the benefit to people watch since it's sort of an enclosed patio.  we arrived too late for breakfast, we tried the lunch menu and it was good but i was not blown away. what made me return was the amazing breakfasts that were being served- the omelettes and waffles... OMG! this place is really fun for breakfast because they encourage drinking (vegas baby). they have a bloody mary bar that allows you to make your own bloody mary for $9.99, with your choice of vodka. we did not partake but it looked fun. i also liked the fact that you can order healthy food. \nFor breakfast  i ordered the LGO egg white omelet served with potatoes and your choice of toast. mr H ordered ham and cheese egg white omelet.  the preserves served with the toast is so delicious. they have some amazing coffee that i couldn't get enough of.  my only complaint is that the hostess tried to seat us in a less than desirable table (in a walled corner, flanked by two full tables). after we said no! she quickly directed us to a table that was much better.  i would return for breakfast  and hopefully try one of their waffles which i understand are made from scratch!
