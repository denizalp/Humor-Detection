Zero stars for this stinky marihuana place. I been there couple times. Security personal whit no education n manners. People pushing each other. Dirty bathrooms. Expensive drinks. Guys in meth standing at you all night security does nothing to protect any body from anything like this. I have seen 2 fights one from girls. Security does nothing just hold one of them so the other one can punch u in the face. My last time there was last night because the door security didn't want to let me in he said my ID fake which it's not. He push me out side the line. He keep it. I call the police and they were on his side. They did an investigation like if I was a drunk illegal criminal minor or I don't know what !!!. They knew the iD was real and it belongs to me they didn't apology for the embarrassing moment and police just give me my ID and said have a good night. Oh really? That's it? They didn't said a world to the security I was expecting like hey security don't push her, or why I don't know something. I have seen this problem before but never thought could happens to me.
