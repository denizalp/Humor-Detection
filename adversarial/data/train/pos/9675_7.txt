Check in is confusing.  Signage is sparse and difficult to navigate.  Atmosphere is smoky.\n\nWe were in room 1084. The Paris hotel is all superficial. Glitz and glamor on the outside, but really shoddy underneath, both in facilities and service.  Especially service.\n\nSoon as we checked in at noon and walked into the room, we discovered that the interior bathroom door handle was broken. Called maintenance; we left for lunch and returned to a note saying that they fixed it. Great.\n\nFast forward to returning that same evening. We find that the exterior door handle is broken. As in \"comes off in your hand\" broken. It is now 11:30pm, and the front desk tells me they don't know when they can get someone to fix it. Per Tiffany, the Paris Hotel has 3;000 rooms. But evidently, only one maintenance person working Saturday night of New Year's Eve weekend?\n\nNow, you may be thinking, \"What's the big deal, just wait till the maintenance guy is ready?\". The problem is that it's midnight now, and both kids are asleep after an 18 hour day. To avoid waking them by the knock on the door, I drag a chair to the hallway to wait for maintenance guy. Fun times! (Yes, he finally showed up.)\n\nSo roll forward a few hours. I get up at 5:30, shower and leave the room to let everyone sleep in. However, I noticed that our toilet paper was almost out, and there was no replacement roll (Paris Hotel savinginey?!?) so I go down to the front desk to ask if Housekeeping can bring a roll of TP. Guess what the guy at the front desk tells me? \"Sorry, housekeeping doesn't start until 9:30.\" Really. \n\nAfter much prodding from me, the guy finally calls housekeeping. Love and behold, there is actually someone working there. Wow. Who woulda thought?  Really wish I had remembered to get that guy's name too.\n\nOther things. Chair handle was broken (when you sit, the arm rest comes off). Dead fly or something else as equally disgusting on lower window sill.  Phones have plugs for you to charge but it doesn't work. Lack of outlets in the room means their work around is to plug in a surge protector with multiple outlets, hanging from the wall.  We weren't in the room much, else I'm sure we'd find more things wrong or broken.\n\nForgot to mention. Elevator \"down\" was missing when we checked in, and was still missing.
