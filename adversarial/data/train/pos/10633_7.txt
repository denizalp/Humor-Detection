Seems clean .. Tries to upsell hard and they get you in and out way too fast .. I got mine done yesterday by Dina. She was extremely rude. Nicked my finger and held my fingers so hard it hurt. Didn't listen to how I wanted them. They look horrible. I called today to see if someone could fix them and the manager said they don't have time for fixes. I will never go there again.
