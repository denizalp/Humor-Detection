I was originally sold by the reviews on here and decided it was worth the drive from Surprise. Scottsdale has a ton of choices and this one place caught my eye. I have come to the Carlotti center  5 times or so now and have enjoyed each experience as well as look forward to it. The office is nice, the people are friendly and services are effective. They answer any questions and are very personable. I've been enjoying my results from the ipl treatments I have received and my skin is much more even toned. I've had many of the freckles I had removed.I think freckles are cute ,but the change sure has been nice and has boosted my confidence.I will be back for more in the future .Many thanks to the Carlotti's!
