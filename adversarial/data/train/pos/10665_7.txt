I realize this place is probably known for its burgers and not its chicken sandwiches, but really? Any restaurant should take at least SOME pride in each of the items they've put on the menu. I have never seen a more pathetic excuse for a chicken sandwich. This piece of chicken was literally thinner than a slice of lunch meat. Sorry, Smashburger, but not even the glopped on mayo or delicious French fries can cover up this sad attempt at a chicken sandwich. I will not be back. Can you even see the chicken in my picture? Probably not. I am so very disappointed. And hungry.
