Hands down! My favorite bakery so far! Since my first visit, I believe I returned at Rosetta countless times.\n\nI went back with my little sister to pick a small cake for my sister's birthday. I picked strawberry chocolate shortcake. Fantastic\/ beautiful and delicious! \n\nAt my workplace, the rule is when it's your birthday, you bring your own cake. Everything looked so good; I didn't know what to choose. Maria, the owner, helped to choose an exquisite cake. White Chocolate and dark chocolate mousse cake with Peach ganache! Omg... I want to die; it was extremely succulent.\n\nThrough email, I contacted Rocco, owner (Maria's son), to order a customized cake. It was a red velvet cake with gold icing, two gold macaroons on top with a two black roses. I went to the bakery, to pay a deposit. I bought their artisanal pizza called piquant. That was amazing, every flavor of the pizza was bursting deliciously in my mouth. I also picked up a dozen mixed macaroons. My family and I devoured them. A week later, I picked up the cake for my friend's 30th birthday. What a beautiful cake! The cake was made with perfection. The Birthday girl and the guests enjoyed it very much.\n\nToday, last minute, we needed a gluten free cake for a co worker leaving us. So I called at Rosetta; I talked to the amazing Maria. She put aside a Framboisie and 10 times three layered (white, milk and dark) of chocolate pastries gluten free. My friend Fotini picked up the pastries from Pedro and Rocco. Lunchtime, we surprised our co coworker with it. She was surprised and enjoyed the treats big time.\n\nFood is absolutely delicious and service is beyond perfect.
