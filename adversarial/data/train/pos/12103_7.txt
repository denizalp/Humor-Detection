This is not pizza.  We eat all kinds of pizza from the franchised chains to gourmet pizza restaurants.  We ordered a meat lover at Chi-Pie for the first time and sorry to say, will also be the last time.  It's a thick pie crusted concoction pilled with way too much sauce and meat stuffing. The crust is thick and lumpy. There are so much fillings that the inside of the pizza was not even warm.  We couldn't  even eat half of it.  If you are expecting to try a different style of pizza, you are going to be disappointed.  We also had to wait 45 mins.  It's definitely not worth it. And it's wait over priced.
