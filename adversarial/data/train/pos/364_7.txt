I had very low expectations from a mall food court Pho shop. Boy was I wrong! I judge all Pho on the broth and this broth is excellent. Better than many sit-down restaurants I have frequented in the past. Another outstanding feature of the Pho Tai is the beef. It is real, thickly cut and tasty. Many shops have paper thin slices but not here. (see photo) This is a mom and pop shop that reminds me of my time in Saigon. Do yourself a favor and give them a try. You'll be glad you did!
