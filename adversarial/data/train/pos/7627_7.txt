Zero stars!  Horrible place with people who are unwilling to help!  I was there last year 2 times a day for over a week looking for my dog, in that time I saw and heard the most HORRIBLE things!  People unable to claim their own pets, animals being put down left and right!  People trying to arrange money and being told of they don't by a certain day, \"we will euthanize!\" People telling me they make them get the shots again even though overs have current shot record.  AND hearing more then once that animals weren't given shots at all, but owners paid for them.  It's horrific!  Never surrender a pet there, never call animal control if you see a wandering pet!
