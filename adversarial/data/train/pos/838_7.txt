Flying private is pretty great.... HELLO ALL SIZES OF LIQUID CONTAINERS ON BOARD, lol! The lady at the reception desk even asks if you'd like a FULL SIZED BOTTLE OF WATER PRIOR TO HEADING TO YOUR AIR CRAFT, ha!\n\nOkay but in all seriousness, this airport is legit. It's small, quiet, private (Har Har), clean and staffed with knowledgeable and kind people! I'll be back.... That is, if I can get the COURAGE to fly back to Vegas in a tiny airplane piloted by my husband! (He's an amazing pilot, but the TURBULENCE flying in was horrible!)
