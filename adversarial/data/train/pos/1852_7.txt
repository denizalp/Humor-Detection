We sat right beside the window we had a lovely view of the lake. The restaurant has a nice ambiance and the staff was friendly. Most importantly the food was absolutely amazing, we had crabcakes and pasta in Seafood sauce with shrimp and the largest scallops on earth!\n\nThe crabcakes were tender and crispy with a spicy coconut Thai sauce. Pasta was cooked to perfection with a creamy seafood sauce and came with jumbo shrimps and scallops which were also cooked to perfection.\n\nHighly recommend this place, unique experience and good food.
