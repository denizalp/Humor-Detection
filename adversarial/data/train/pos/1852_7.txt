I've had a long history with this place. If I recall correctly I've been visiting this place since I was about 7. A decade and a half later I still occasionally go.\n\nit's a decent place, with low prices, on acceptable food, but don't expect any wow factor. The service has (always) been unreliable. You may have excellent service on one occasion, and yet encounter abysmal service on another visit, when it really isn't even busy. I'll break down the pros and cons of the place.\n\nPros: \n-Exceptionally low cost\n-Reasonable quality to cost\n-one or two really good items\n-courteous service (mostly)\n-the interior decorating isn't so bad (I like the exposed brick, and wine racks)\n\nCons:\n-teenage kids deliver the actual food items (they usually lack manners or care)\n-the last two times I've gone the guy who brought my food actually had pretty bad B.O. (but these could have just been isolated incidents)\n- nothing remotely fancy\n-there can be a long lineup out the door some evenings (fri-sat) up to an hour or possibly more\n-servers have made a mistake on my remarkably simple\/straight forward order at the rate of 1 in 3 visits. \n-Pizza is soggy and nasty unless you order it well done (in which case it's just okay)\n-veal can be really stringy, so go for the chicken parm instead.\n\nThere you have it. The best item on the menu in my opinion would have to be the Penne A la Bruno. It's actually pretty good, and like everything else there, it's cheap.
