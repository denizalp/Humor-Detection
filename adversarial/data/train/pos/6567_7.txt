Today I had my first experience at this establishment.  My experience was excellent and I will likely return for much more work in the future.  The owner was friendly and offered great suggestions on my repair.  I was told all my options (he had a standard, mid-grade and luxury tire) and didn't try to point me in any certain direction or sell me anything I didn't need.  \n\nWithout an appointment or notice, he did the repair while I waited.  The price of labor was more than fair as well.  This place is a lovely little gem in a wonderful neighborhood.  I've gone to other bike shops in town and will certainly be coming back to Old Town Cycles when I need another repair.
