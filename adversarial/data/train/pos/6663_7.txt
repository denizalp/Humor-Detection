Where do i start? The burgers are large & dry, no flavour. For a place that sells $13 burgers, it's a huge disappointment that their fries & onion rings are not freshly made, but frozen. I tried the sweet potato fries that everyone is raving about...i've had much better. Soggy, oily and obviously frozen. Too expensive and doesn't compare in taste to The Burger's Priest or Five Guys. Even Hero burgers & fries taste better!
