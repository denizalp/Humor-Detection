Found a new breakfast and lunch spot on Yelp and it delivers in service and flavor! I'm all for pancakes and waffles-the usual, but sometimes I'm craving for a hearty breakfast without all the floury carbs. Rise and Shine centers their breakfast go-to with steak and eggs, but they have all the classics favorites too. Our server, Maria, was a ray of sunshine friendliness. Even the host, was cheerful when seating us.\n I ordered a coffee with cream and it was smooth and strong. I had to order their popular rib eye with eggs and potato hash. Just a note, Maria did let me know the hash brown has green onions in it, but you can request your hash plain if you like. I don't mind green onions in general, but next time I think I will have my hash plain, but if you do want it more savory, go with the green onions. The rib eye steak was tender and well seasoned with pepper and not too much salt. The poached eggs were perfectly runny inside and flavorful. The Build Your Own Burger was definitely home made and was delicious. It wasn't densely packed together like frozen patties and tasted fresh. They also serve alcohol here if you want to get your brunch on with something bubbly. I also was wowed by the bread in a cup. It's like the center of a cinnamon roll in a little cup with a cream cheese frosting dipping sauce. It was steaming when I tore into it. Sometimes a little flour carb is ok and when it's this good, it's a must try.\n\nAll in all, this place is a hit for me. The service is excellent and the food can back it up. The place is very clean and I think it has enough charm to be a local favorite. Definitely will be back and highly recommend.
