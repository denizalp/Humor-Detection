The butcher at LF ROCKS! The ground pork and ground beef is superior. When I want to make bulgogi or Korean spicy pork, I go so often that the butcher knows me and anticipates what I want. I can tell the butcher, and he slices the meats to restaurant quality paper thickness. LF is clean and organized. I can find the items that I want really quickly and get out of the store. I give this asian market thumbs up for cleanliness and good customer service.
