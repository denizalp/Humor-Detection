Yay, movies!  I need to do this more often.\n\nBeing a fairly new resident of Cleveland, I don't have the \"before\" picture to compare this wonderful new refurbished theater to.  Even still, it was awesome.  An adult ticket, at $9, was a little steep, but I'm not sure if it's any cheaper in the bigger theaters (as I've only ever gone to the movies during the daytime in the Cleve).  The popcorn was really good. I don't take a thing like popcorn lightly. It wasn't too salty, greasy, cold, or chewy.  Great popcorn.\n\nEveryone was really nice there.\n\nThe theater itself was kind of small, with the screen a bit askew, but it was ok because it wasn't too crowded and we were able to get a \"good seat.\"  As Rob mentioned, the picture and sound quality were outstanding.  It's all the perks of a mega-theater in \"high def\" and all that, without the feeling that your soul's being sucked out.  Another good thing? The floors were not sticky in the least.  The place is majorly clean.\n\nI loved coming here for an evening out, and there are several dining options within close proximity (Luxe, Stone Mad, etc.) to make a whole night of it.
