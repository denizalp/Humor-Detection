I knew that I had visit this restaurant after seeing the Cleveland Asian community reviewing and singing its praise. I sat down and was presented a menu with the familiar logo from their other locations. I was puzzled because this looked like typical Chinese-American food. I knew that they gave me the \"white people\" menu because of the Yelp pictures I saw of the real menu. So if you get a color menu, ask for the white menu. White meaning printed on white paper. The white people menu is on colored paper. Paradoxical and confusing. I met up with the legendary Young P who was also eager to try China Sea by CSU. There is something on the menu called Seafood Tanglement. I imagine a \"rat king\" or a mass of underwater creatures joined together at the fin. We went for the safe bets and ordered the pork, egg and rice. The spiced sliced beef was served cold and tasted just like roast beef deli meat. The bubble tea was very good. Not overly sweet and was a good compliment to the meal. I am glad I took the recommendation of Mao Yin.
