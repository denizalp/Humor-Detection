Nice appetizers, during happy hour and even better pricing! We popped in to try happy hour before a movie and enjoyed a variety of foods including delicious fried deviled eggs 5\/5, crispy chicken skins with a good sauce to dip in 4\/5, hand cut house fries 4\/5, honey soy chicken bahn mi slider 5\/5, signature bahn mi slider 3\/5, beer brined chicken wings 3\/5 and lastly the Chris' BAD ASS chili 4\/5. I would say my favorite things were the fried deviled eggs and the chicken skins, both unique and tasty.\n\nEverything we tried we shared three ways amongst friends. The seating area in 595 Craft and Kitchen was very limited so we were lucky to get in and seated for their Happy Hour (which lasts 3-6 PM and then midnight to close). People around us were trying other items and we all chatted about how good the food was. All of the servers were friendly and very helpful. Enjoy the pics and give this place a try for yourself!
