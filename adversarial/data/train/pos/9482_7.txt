I'm a Las Vegas local who have seen many shows up and down the strip ranging from Cirque to many musical reviews.  I've got to be honest, I walked in the Shimmer Cabaret expecting an opera style show but I was floored with the experience.  They sang  opera, oldies, country, in English, in Italian (I think lol), show tunes, Elvis, Patriotic medley and even Areola (that's a blend of Aria and rock and rolla bwahahahahaha!)  I'm sure I missed other types of genre they covered but what I can add is that my kids and I were brought to our feet rocking out and applauding in amazement from their wide vocal range and vast collection of styles.  I guess you can see a boring show with no variety but why when you can see a hundred shows all in one?  This is a must see show at the LVH, but don't take my word for it, go see for yourself. It's like a good roller coaster ride, I can't wait to go again!
