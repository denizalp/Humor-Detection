I have a hard time believing the stellar Yelp reviews this show gets; \nAbsinthe is the most insipid Vegas offering I've ever seen. The hosts lack any charm to make their mocking of audience members and extreme potty humor palatable. The routine is an uninspired Sacha Baron Cohen and Sarah Silverman rip-off. If you don't like those comedians -- and even if you do, perhaps -- you will not like the show. The acrobats were, at best, Cirque du Soliel castoffs or rejects. \nI had a friend present at the show the night before where a performer on the high-wire crashed into the audience and knocked some guy in the head with the balance bar. That part of the show was dropped from the show we attended on Friday Nov. 4, 2011. No great loss, I'm sure. \nWe didn't stay through to the end. Spare yourself the agony of having to pretend you like the show because you paid as much as you did for the tickets. You'd be better off mindlessly dumping your cash into some slots while staring into the middle distance.
