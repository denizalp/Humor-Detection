Best drunk food on the strip. Only struggle is that if you're on the other side, it's going to be a trek to get here.\n\nParking is super easy because there's a lot. Also, very close to the Wynn\/Encore, so if you're staying there, why haven't you come here for tacos yet?\n\nLine moves quickly so long as you don't goof up and wait in the wrong line. Each line has specific types of meat you can order. After you get your food, shimmy on over to the cashier to pay.\n\nTried both the lengua\/carne asada\/carne asada fries. All delicious. No complaints.
