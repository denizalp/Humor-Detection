These people need to be ashamed of themselves.  One patient's service was provided in July 2014. After we submitted the information requested by Southwest Service Administrators as instructed, they never reprocessed the claim.  It is now August 2015, and their staff told us that he did not know why the claim's never reprocessed.  They're \"working on it now.\" Absurd.
