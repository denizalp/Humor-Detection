I came in the last 30 minutes before closing and it was packed! There were plenty of people still in line ahead of me but the employees didn't seem bothered by it. \nI tried ordering one of the mousse drinks but they were all out of mousse :-(  \nMy sister and I opted for two matcha lattes with boba and got a free pearl milk tea as part of the promotion. \nUnderstanding that it is a new business, the wait was pretty long. I think 20 minutes? \nWell after getting our drinks, I would say the drinks were just good. But the boba is smaller than what other boba shops offer. I wasn't very fond of it honestly. \nI don't want my ephemeral sense of disappointment make me miss out on something probably pretty amazing. Therefore, I'll be sure to come back and try another drink from their extensive menu.
