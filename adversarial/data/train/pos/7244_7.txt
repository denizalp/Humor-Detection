I can't give this a 1 because I didn't get to eat anything. I'm sure the food is lovely. I'm sure the service is lovely. The ambiance sucks though. I valeted my car and wandered in - it was a mad house. Loud and boisterous chatter with no sound deadening to help. Every surface is metal, tile or hardwood and every sound and every utterance is reflected and amplified - filling the room and getting in my ears like a thick soup.\n\nI had the same issue with Ocean Club once before. I've managed to eat there successfully twice, but a third time I had to leave out of anxiety. The second time I tried eating at Ocean Club was a nightmare, but after we moved a couple of times, I made the best of it. The food and service there was great - as I imagine it is at City Hall. I just can't deal with such a crowd.\n\nToo much noise and commotion like that puts me on edge and I can't enjoy a fancy meal. I guess it's not the sort of place one goes for a quiet fine dining experience. It's like a loud douchey crowded nightclub without the music, but at the same volume. \n\nI had just arrived at City Hall, and immediately wanted to leave. My social anxiety kicked in, and we split. The valet hadn't even returned from parking our car when we asked them to bring it back. It's a shame, because we really wanted to try it out. Maybe we will try to eat there sometime when it's not so busy. Dinner time on a weeknight is apparently not going to work.
