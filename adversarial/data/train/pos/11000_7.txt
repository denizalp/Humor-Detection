I occasionally get pedirles at the Look Style Society in Town Square but the other day I was feeling like I needed a pick me up and the Town Square location did not have availability for that's same evening. So I went online and booked an appointment for the TÃ­voli Village location.\n\nI like that you can make appointments online. I think that's the mos timportant factor for me. The pedicures ain't cheap but theykast an hour and the spa service that's accompanies it is pretty great so I will ocasionales splurge. I forgot the name of the nail person (something like Aileen) but she did a very good job. I wasn't in a chatty mood, and she didn't strike up conversation either so it was perfect. There were a couple of other people getting manicures as well; they were on the chatty side. Nonetheless I closed my eyes and nearly dozed off. \n\nOne last thing. Something I've always found ackward at the Town Square location is that the nail person takes your payment right there, at the chair. It's kind of uncomfortable. Here as able to pay and leave tip at the front. Little weirdness on my part, but I just don't need everybody and their mother to see what my method of payment is and how much I tip. That's just me though.
