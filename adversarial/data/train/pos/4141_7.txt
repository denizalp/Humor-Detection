So sad to have had a negative experience here after so many good ones. \nToday was less busy than any other day we have visited the restaurant. \nThe waitress came to our table to ask for our order and bring check. I between we had to ask passing servers for service. \nWhen we the bill came we tried to use our Groupon and were told that we could not use it. When we have the waitress our debit card to pay the waitress overcharged our card. (Ludmila) was the name stated on the receipt. \n\nWe are now currently waiting for her to return to our table to fix this issue. \n\nTwo stars were due to the food and other servers being awesome.\n\nGeneral manager \"Carlos\" came to our table and treated us as it was our fault for groupon a being used in previous visits. He didn't even apologize for the waitress overcharging is just dismissed what I was saying and said it was an easy fix\"check your bills when Ludmila is your waitress.\n\nUpdate: after having to show him we have been there many times with positive experiences, the general manager attempted to show us some fine print which even he could not find. He ended up letting us use the groupon with a heavy emphasis that it would not be allowed in future visits. Next time Carlos, how about a sorry about the inconsistency, and sorry for our server overcharging you. Don't blame customers for a waitress not checking up on a table and having your patrons flag down servers for service. \n\nLast time coming here!
