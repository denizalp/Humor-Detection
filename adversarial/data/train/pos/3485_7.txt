If you swallow a boba seed, a boba tree will grow in your stomach! \n\nOr not.  Whatever.  Believe what you want.\n\nI feel like I'm in the 1990's again because there seems to be a sudden influx in boba tea shops opening recently.  I swear there's a new place I'm bookmarking every week.  Anyways, stopped in on Saturday night for some tea.  I had gotten the Cheese Peach Tea and tried the Cheese Lychee Tea as well.  Both tasted of tea and not that artificial flavor syrup which I appreciate but I feel like this other place that rhymes with \"Sea Twirl\" has a more robust tea taste that I love.  While waiting for my drink, I was staring at the wall where it was telling you to sip your drink at a 45Â° angle.  Hey, a tea that drinks like a Snakebite?  I'm in!  So after popping off the top and taking a sip, it was increasingly more flavorful and rich.  The cheese, AKA salted crema, is actually just cream cheese with some cream and it's my favorite topping here.\n\nThe Super Grapefruit tea is sooo refreshing! As cute as the grapefruit slices are, I wish it wasn't included. It makes toppings and add-ins hard to drink.  The Cheese Gyokuro Green Tea (Buckwheat + green tea) and the Cheese Chamomile Citron Green Tea are also pretty tasty.\n\nSo while I'm still loving \"Sea Twirl,\" I can see myself stopping in Boba Tree again and again.  It's a helluva lot closer to home, dat cheese topping doe, and they have a loyalty card!
