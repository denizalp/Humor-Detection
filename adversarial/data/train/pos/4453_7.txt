I'm SO happy to finally have a Cafe Rio on this side of town!  I like the fresh new look and service has been good.  I do however miss the days when all the employees would welcome you with a big loud \"Welcome\" shout and excitedly yell out \"FREE MEAL\".  That was fun but seems to be forgotten.  The food is on par with the Eastern location (best Cafe Rio in Vegas).  This location is missing the stevia strawberry lemonade which is a great option for us sugar free folk.  Loving this convenient location.
