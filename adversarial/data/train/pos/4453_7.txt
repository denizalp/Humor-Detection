This place is so awesome. Beautiful. Comfortable. I highly recommend it to anybody! The bedroom, the view, the service is outstanding. The quality and interior design impeccable. Specially considering the price range.\n\nThe lobby has a beautiful touch and the interior design is finally up to european contemporary standards. \n\nThere are many nooks and niches everywhere to lounge and gather, to hide to cuddle to watch some TV, to eat & drink, to chill or do whatever you have to do on all your mobile devices.\n\nCheck out some of the pictures I made or go to their website to get an impression and an advance glimpse of your stay.\n\nComplementary coffee, fresh lemon water, and free Wi-Fi. A complementary airport shuttle (every hour & half hour 24\/7) and around the area to the shops and restaurants. It's really well worth checking in hear hours or a day earlier if you're just traveling to get to other places.\n\nPool, gym and Jacuzzi round off the wellness experience. Try getting a room way up high to get an amazing view of the airport, Phoenix, the huge blue sky and beautiful color changing mountains of this magical place called Arizona.
