I've had over seven massages here and each one of them has been good. My first one was over a year ago. And since then I've learned the benefits of massage. I'm a yoga and fitness instructor and have been practising yoga for over 15 years, and part of me believes that I get the best massage with yoga and exercise. And although that maybe true, I do believe that a good professional massage can do the body a world of good.\n\nI've had 60 minute and 90 minute massages here and today was the first time I looked at the watch carefully and now know the massage is not actually 60 minutes. By the time you get in and get out the massage time is closer to 48 minutes for a 60 minute scheduled massage.\n\nI bought massages in advance so used their pre-paid \"program\" which roughly translates to about $73 a massage. I went for the basic package without any \"elevations.\"\n\nThree stars since the massage is shorter than they say it will be, but the massages are good. They should schedule enough time to get in, change, clean, pay, prepare thereby giving good value and service to their customers.
