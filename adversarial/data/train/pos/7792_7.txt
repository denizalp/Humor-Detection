This place was hoppin' on a Thursday night! so much so that almost ALL the tables and bar seats were taken up by the typical Queen West-West crowd. After about half an hour of waiting and one well made gin and tonic later....all 7 of us were cozily seated on a table with very high bar stools. You could either lean back and cross your arms, or hunch over the table.. a little awkward, but I was too happy to have a seat to complain.\nWe ordered 2 plates of a whole variety of options from the snack menu. The things that really stood out were the pork belly buns and the latkes with smoked salmon and cream cheese, everything else was good, but not memorable. I'm definitely trying the oysters next time, and perhaps a cocktail that's more challenging to prepare. \nThe ambiance was *perfect*. Great music, not too loud, cool crowd, eclectic and interesting rustic decor, and best of all -  a small phone booth incase you receive a call while in this establishment and cant hear, you can quickly step in here(or sit, there's a comfy little single-seater sofa) instead of going outside and freezing till your call is done! \nIf you aren't convinced to give this place a shot yet.... I went here last night, and I'm most likely going here again tomorrow. I think that just about explains how much I like this place.
