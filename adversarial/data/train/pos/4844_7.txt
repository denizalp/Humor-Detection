PROS\n+Awesome operating hours (24\/7)\n+Location, location, location (conveniently located on the 1st floor of the Paris hotel and you can see the Strip from most tables in the restaurant)\n+Pretty good customer service\n+Milkshakes are large in size and flavor\n+Sugar Factory candy store is connected to the restaurant\n\nCONS\n-Limited late night\/early morning menu (mostly appetizers and only a few desserts are served during the off hours)\n\nThis isn't a bad place to satisfy your sweet tooth if you're on the Las Vegas Strip.  The only problem was the limited menu they have for late night hours but the customer service was pretty good and it's a nice restaurant with a cool view of the Strip.  The milkshakes are monster-sized so you can actually share it with someone if you don't think you can drink it all.  The food was alright, not the greatest but I would definitely come here for the dessert, milkshakes and candy!
