It's a mall. Malls are not my thing. Also my boyfriend has banned me from wearing my slippers here because \"it's Southpark\". There is some sort of unwritten dress code among the Southpark residents and it does not include being comfortable. \n\n\nThe cool things about this mall:\n- It is shiny and always clean. They really do keep up it in pristine condition. \n- Food! The food court has some good options but there is a lot around the perimeter as well. \n- So many stores. There is a wide selection here so you can get your brows done at Idolize, dad's Christmas gift at Brookstone and pop over to Bath and Body works for those addicting soaps. \n\n\nThe cons:\n- It gets busy. Like super busy there is nowhere to park at all busy. \n- Possibly to do with the above point: the people here are aggressive especially when driving. They come whipping around the corners like they are being followed by a zombie horde that will get them if they don't get that parking spot!\n- The people in the middle who pester you to buy things. \n\n\nPossibly not the best location for bargain hunting but it is a nice environment if you like shopping.
