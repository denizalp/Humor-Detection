Beware - Food Baby On Board!\nWhy do I take an All You Can Eat menu as a personal challenge?\n\nI went yesterday with 2 friends for late lunch\/early dinner.  We had planned on Ichi Ban at Central and Thomas for the proximity to our houses, but they didn't open till 5.  They'd been to Sushi Q before, and suggested it.  They did not tell me about the AYCE menu!  $25.95  with a decent selection of apps, nigiri and rolls.  \n\nI wasn't doing to do it.  I was going to order from the regular menu.  I chose 3 rolls (soft shell crab, tootsie and I don't remember the third) - when I figured the price, I realized I was just a couple bucks shy of the AYCE price.  So, if I ordered just one more item, it would be more cost effective to go the AYCE route.\nWhat was I thinking?  Three rolls is PLENTY!\n\nOrdered - soft shell crab, tootsie and summer (spicy crab roll with spicy tuna on top) to start - with the plan of doing a round 2.\nAte - all of mine, plus helped one of my companions finish her summer roll.  It was TOO MUCH FOOD!\n\nFor my appetite, the AYCE is a waste of money.  I should have done a miso soup and two rolls - that would have been perfect for me.  Dining companion M should have also ordered from the regular menu.  We would have been fine if we didn't have to help her.  Dining companion D made the AYCE well worth it - he was the only one it ended up making sense for.\n\nAll rolls were fresh and tasty.  D cannot have any seeds, the sushi chef was happy to make adjustments accordingly.  Oh, and M hates avocado - he was also happy to oblige her.  Good to know they will make substitutions, even on an AYCE menu!  \n\nThe lady next to me had a seaweed salad that looked awesome and very fresh - and her salmon sashimi was gorgeous!\n\nClean place, friendly staff, fair prices.  I love strip mall sushi!  Places like this, you know you're paying for the food - not the address and state of the art decor.  (Why I don't go to the \"pretty\" places much - I'd rather spend my cash on the food than the \"see and be seen\" factor!)\n\nIt wasn't the most amazing sushi in town, but there was nothing wrong with it, and I will gladly be back!
