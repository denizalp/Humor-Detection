I'm writing this from the perspective of someone who is currently avoiding sugar and has always hated spicy food. One might say avoid eating Thai, but I'm not a person is easily dissuaded! \n\nOrdering was difficult (due to me and my funky restriction) :) It went something like this :\n----------------------\nMe: \"I'm trying to avoid sugar - what do you suggest\"\n\nWaitress: \"Are you like allergic to sugar, because we have nothing that doesn't have sugar\"\n\nMe:\"No, not allergic, just trying to avoid it... What about the duck\"\n\nWaitress: \"Duck prices have gone up, don't have any\"\n\nMe: \"the beef salad with no dressing?\"\n\nWaitress: \"Sure, how hot?\"\n\nMe: \"MILD\"\n\n---------------\n\nI was then brought the hottest food I've ever eaten. Rather than being a total brat and sending it back, I attempted to get it down. I've never been so \"hot\" in my life! I felt nauseaus, the room was spinning, I downed 5  twenty ounce glasses of water. I don't get how you spice lovers do it :) . It was truely painful to eat ! \n\nSo I know this was not \"mild\" because my coworker got the tri color curry also \"mild\" and it was perfect. A nice subtle heat that builds as you eat the dish. Not something that knocks you on your a** on the first bite. I realize heat levels are hard to \"regulate\", but it's one of my major pet peeves when a place can't show some consistency. When both dishes are \"mild\" and one is 10x hotter than the other there's an issue!!\n\nOn a side note, the tri color curry was fabulous and addictive and I completely understand the love it gets! One of the best currys I've ever eaten, although I'm hardly an expert in curry. \n\nAfter lunch my coworker and I were both feeling pretty lousy all afternoon. Not stomach lousy but I want to pass out lousy. Had trouble staying awake, killer headache, etc. After eating freaking lettuce + a few ounces of sliced beef and 2 bites of curry I shouldn't feel like crap! I suspect too much MSG, but I know I'm pretty sensitive to MSG so others may not be affected. \n\nOverall it was cute, homey, and the tri color curry was damn good. It will probably be awhile before I return - the MSG and the raging heat level on my \"mild\" salad have scared me off .
