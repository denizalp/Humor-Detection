I stopped in last evening to give this place a try and saw that it was Taco Tuesday--a taco ice cream with 3 scoops of ice cream of choice and two toppings for $3.99.  I got the red velvet shell and chose cookies & cream, salted caramel, and chocolate chip cookie dough ice cream.  For the two toppings, I got shredded coconut and chocolate chips.  Service was quick and I was soon sitting at one of the tables by the window.  \n\nI got a spoon when served the taco and it was a good thing.  The shell is thin and breaks easily.  The taco is placed in a piece of paper something like a hot dog holder when you buy from a vendor.  \n\nThe ice cream was OK.  The dips of ice cream are small and the ice cream is nothing special.  There was a fair number of people there at 9:15 last night.  There was a line out the door.\n\nI am glad they have bathrooms because I needed a quick hand wash to get the stickiness of my hands.\n\nI can't see myself coming to CREAM often.  Now and then, perhaps, but I'd rather have frozen yogurt or other ice cream.  It's convenient here, but there's not much of a draw for me.  OK yes.\n\nThey said they were working on accepting Apple Pay.
