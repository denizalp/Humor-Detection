Went here Nov.1 2014.\nThe club is very interesting, especially  on the rooftop. Nice views and people. Got bottle service which was a total scam here. I will never go back. I ordered a table with 2 bottles of Grey Goose because I hate Sky Vodka.  I was cool with the upcharge.  They tell me I have $160.00 credit for a reason I will never understand. But I can't use it towards my bill. I never received my 2nd bottle of Grey Goose on top of that. The bill was $400.00 more then told and the bottle service girl couldn't even break down the bill. I'm asking if this table cost X amount with gratuities, where did the other cost come from? Total frekin scam. On another note, music was fair. Mix of a little of everything. Dance floor is a good size. Well lit also, so you can actually see if you really have a dime on the dance floor or a buzzard. Not crowded at all which was fine by mine. You could actually get to the bathroom in under 1 minute.
