Well, it has happened. THE rudest waitress EVER in the entire history of customer service... yes my friends, we had her. I still kept the smile on my face, because of the people I was with. One of which was my manager, so I did not want her to see me get down right street ghetto on the manager of the restaurant. \n\nThis was my coworkers birthday celebration, (it was on June 1) which was ruined by the lack of service this waitress provided. I have one friend, who does not eat fish, order a few things off of the menu. The waitresses response to her, \"oh, um, your table has already ordered a lot of sushi.\" EXCUSE ME RUDE LADY! She basically just called my friend a fatty, in the middle of the Biltmore, and with a restaurant FULL of customers. I mean, who in the world does this waitress think she is?? If WE, a paying customer, want to order the entire menu, YOUR job is go take the order, and get said food. \n\nEasy enough?!? NOPE. She then continues on with her rudeness with, \"did you want ALL of your food brought at once, or as it's made?\" Being that we came in as a group, we figured we can all eat at the same time, so we asked her to bring it all out at once. We simply answered her question. Well... not so simple. Her response, \"it will just take longer if we bring it all out together.\" OMG!!!! THEN WHY DID YOU ASK????? RUDE! RUDE! RUDE! That just lowered your tip by $5.00, keep your rude comments coming! On top of it all, SHE WAS TRAINING A NEW WAITRESS!!! WHAT????? Yes. True story. \n\nI kept my cool, and did not say anything to her. As bad as it was hurting me. I wanted to just get right back into her face. I mean, what the hell lady! \n\nBefore I get all ghetto on this review, I'm going to stop myself. With all of this being said, we are never returning back to this location. I do not want to experience what he did, again. Bad move on hiring this lady!
