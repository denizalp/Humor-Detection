Not too bad for $3, but keep in mind that you really get what you pay for.  I've been to see a few movies here now, and the sound quality seems to be equally bad in all theaters.  I often find myself turning to my wife asking, \"What did they just say?\"  \n\nAnd what's up with the paintings in the lobby of Bush and Cheney?\n\nOn the bright side, we always get a kick out the photo they show in the previews of Mr. Pollack standing in front of an American flag!  Amazing hair!
