Great used book store in Plaza Midwood with a very angry cat. \n\nI could stop my review there, but it just wouldn't do justice to the love I have for this place. Amongst rows of shelves, you'll find just about everything here at a great price. The older gentleman that runs the store always knows where whatever you ask for is and his suggestions have never steered me wrong. Sure, he's not exactly brimming with Southern friendliness but he's a straight shooter and knows his books - what more do you want in a bookstore?\n\nThe parking is easy, the hours are convenient and there's just something so mom-and-pop mixed with dive bar mixed with almost-out-of-business-please-help-us that makes it lovable to me. But that damn cat needs to be taken to their house - sometimes I wander into him by accident and his claws have their way with me :'(
