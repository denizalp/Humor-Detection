The jury is still out. \n\nLOVE:\n\nThe swank is great. Love the style. Love the Cosmo actually. \n\nLoveliest pool deck w\/ fabulous views! Ah-Mazing at night!\n\nCabanas w\/ private jacuzzi are bomb! \n\nLots of VIP tables. \n\nLOATHE:\nIt's almost criminal to make your guests climb 6-8 flights of stairs just to enter. \nIt's a deal breaker for most girls wearing short skirts and 5\" stilletos! All you see are girls flashing their chachis up and down the stairs as girls stammer on their heels. it's a work out. I regretted my choice of shoes that night. \n\nDrinks are typical $17-20, a pop! \n\nSmall dance floor. \n\nVery aggressive and rude security. \n\nThere is a difference between being firm&affective as opposed to aggravated assault.  I understand the need for crowd control but when people are wall to wall, shoving and yelling in people's faces to MOVE doesn't create more space.  Especially when there is no where to move to! It's pretty simple really. Stop going over capacity and you might restore balance to the situation. \n\nI've only been to a concert here but would love to come back for other events. Just not in heels again.
