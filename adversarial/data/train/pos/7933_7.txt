I went to the Center for Science and Wonder to see a one person show starring Jennifer Jayne.  This review is for the Center and not her show (which was very good, BTW!)\n\nThe Center is along Sunset Road behind PT's in an office complex at the rear of the property.  As you drive in, it will be on your left.  I was going to enter the A-111 address number but there was a sign on the door about a meeting in progress.  A person going to the same show directed me two doors down which is the lobby for the theatre.\n\nI checked in with some very friendly people and then went in the door to the theatre.  It's a small theatre--holding perhaps 100 people--with seating facing a stage and with some other seating on the front right.\n\nIt's a perfect venue for this kind of show--one character with a screen and some projections on the screen to go along with the show.  There is a unisex bathroom.\n\nThe only problem with the theatre was the lack of sufficient air conditioning.  At 7:30 PM, it was still in the triple digits outside and the system just couldn't keep up with the temperature.  \n\nI have joined their Facebook page to be apprised of other programs that are scheduled for the future.
