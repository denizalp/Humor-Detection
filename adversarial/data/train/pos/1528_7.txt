Just like the other reviewers said: delicious food, but horrible service.\n\nI ordered the rotisserie chicken with dirty rice and it was phenomenal. The service though, sucked bawlz. I was there with my bf and his uncle, and the damn waitress kept looking at my bf the entire time she was talking to us. Never mind when she's taking my orders, she glances at me for a split second, and smiles at my bf for 5 minutes. Come on now, can we be less obvious here? \"Anything to DRINK?\" she screeched, looking straight at my bf who was already drinking Coke but I gave her the benefit of the doubt and assumed she was talking to ALL of us, since I had NOT YET ordered anything. On top of all these shenanigans, when I harmlessly commented that the carrot in my bf's salad tasted pickled, she tries to make a quasi-joke calling me a \"CRAZY GIRL!!!\". Ummm I'm pretty sure that to be making jokes with me you have to have first built some rapport with me, no? Very annoying.\n\nIn conclusion, if you're a dude, go there. Food is great, and the waitresses will practically give you a lap dance. If you're a girl, you can still go and enjoy the food, but be prepared for all kinds of stupidity.
