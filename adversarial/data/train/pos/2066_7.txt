My kids are sushi fanatics like their mommy so love it here. This is a fun trendy new spot so if your coming in during lunch or dinner hours expected a long line and no tables to sit at. So far for all the times I've been here all the fish has been fresh. Let's hope they keep that up. \n\nBad things I can note is that I found a piece of plastic in my sushi burrito here before and that was not a nice surprise and depending on your burrito roller that if they don't roll it tight enough it will all fall apart in your hand making it very difficult to eat. \n\nTaro chips with cheddar dip is amazeballs. Light, thin, crispy, and perfectly seasoned the way any chip should taste. Goes great with their salsa too!! Loveeeee their salsa lol
