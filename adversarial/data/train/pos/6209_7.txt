First time in here and we ordered the snowbox. \n\nPresentation is cute!! We customized our own and its a pretty good size for two people. \n\nId give it a 1\/10 when it comes to flavor. I know its snow ice so it's supposed to be a lot of ice but itll be nice to put more flavor to it! More than half of the snow ice is just pure white ice and no flavoring!! \n\nId give it another chance and try their gelato. Maybe itll make me bump the ratings a lil. \n\nThe staff are very nice and helpful! Cute place :)  (the reason its not 2 star)
