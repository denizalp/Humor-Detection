I'm a fan of Ross: especially a new location. Thanks to Yelper Peter S, Mom and I were able to run over and take advantage of opening weekend values, and great inventory. \n\nLike all other Ross stores, it consists of designer brands heavily marked down. I picked up a couple of bikinis for under $20\/ea; thongs for 2-5$ a pair and Lucky Brand jeans for 39$ even with alterations, these jeans will be less than half retail. Can't beat a deal like that. \n\nThe second day we found a Dooney & Bourke purse and several pairs of designer (Calvin Klein, Ralph Lauren, Steve Madden) shoes at fantastic price points. Love the fact that you can have carry brands, at the discount prices which usually accompany poorly made products. \n\nThey had the usual housewares\/gifts section; bedding, pillows, children's wear and toys and men's wear. The store itself was large, spotless and very organized and fully staffed. \n\nThanks for coming to the Hood, Ross! Hope you stay fabulous :)) Ross is boss! \n\n\nYelp 100 Challenge
