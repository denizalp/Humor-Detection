Monte Carlo, why did I choose to stay here?  Must be that it is located right in the middle of the strip, next to Aria and the City Center.  This used to be my wife's favorite hotel in Las Vegas.  Don't ask me why because I honestly don't know.  With many newer and older but better establishments on the strip, there's really no reason to choose Monte Carlo unless you already knew that...\n\nthe POOL has a lazy river!  It's not as long as the ones you might find at MGM, but it is sufficient enough to relax and take a moment away from the busy casino noise.  You can also rental a tube as floating device at the service counter.  But really, that's all the highlights of this hotel, unless you enjoy...\n\nCHEAP FOOD COURT adjacent to the main elevators.  If I remember correctly, they have Starbucks, McDonald's, Manchu Wok, Rubio's, and Subway.  These are some of the choices that you might not find in other hotels on the strip.  Of course, if you want to drop a few hundred dollars, you can do at the casino, unless you knew to...\n\ngo to ANDRE'S, the fine dinning restaurant of Monte Carlo.  I have not personally tried it, but according to fellow yelpers, it's a traditional french restaurant that's hidden away inside the casino.  When food coma hits, you might just want to passed out anywhere on the casino floor, unless you already have a...\n\nROOM at the Monte Carlo, which is nothing spectacular, nothing more a than regular hotel room with regular beds, chairs, and bathroom.  Very regular, but adequate for your nap until the thin walls allow you to hear everything your neighbors do.  That's when you ask yourself, why did I choose...\n\nMonte Carlo.  Must be its centralized location on the strip.
