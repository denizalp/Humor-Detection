I always make it a point to visit when I'm in Vegas and this small locals piano\/karaoke bar doesn't disappoint. \nStaff and regulars take turns belting out everything from show tunes to pop hits accompanied by piano throughout the night. I'm not sure just anyone off the street can walk in and sing, which is just as well because the staff and what appears to be regulars can entertain so well, you will find it's more fun to watch and sing along. \nThe bar is small so be ready to stand or cram into a booth for a seat, but it's worth a walk down Fremont Street experience to find this gem.
