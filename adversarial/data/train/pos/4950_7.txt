Solid dim sum.. Good special before 11:00am. I have had problems here with patrons who feel they can jump me in line because I don't speak chinese. Be forewarned if you try this, this mofo gui lau will create a scene your 90 yr old grandma will not be very happy with. Next number in line is next number in line, regardless of what language you speak.
