We ate here with a group of six and had great food, fabulous customer service, and found it a nice atmosphere with some background noise \nbut not enough to effect our ability to have a conversation. They have a new menu which is fabulous and our server, Christine, did a phenomenal job of offering suggestions, ie coconut shrimp, strawberry salad, chicken club sandwich, broasted chicken, and buffalo chicken wrap. They were all hits! For dessert we split brookies and bread pudding... yum!! There are two patios which would make great areas for closed parties. The prices are reasonable and we highly recommend!
