I love me some Chipotle, and I like getting some whenever I'm too busy to cook, need a pick me up meal, or am just craving it. Unfortunately, I'm stuck with this location since it is located so conveniently on campus.\n\nIt doesn't matter how short the line is, I just assume a 20 minute wait (and that is a fast day--try to avoid peak lunch\/dinner hours, and order online if you can). Somehow they manage to be so slow at serving food. Additionally, they seem to be really bad at keeping all the ingredients ready when they start running out. There have been times where I was told a 5 minute wait for something, and it ends up taking 15 minutes, which is just ridiculous.\n\nAdditionally, I don't know if it is because I'm a small Asian girl, but they always skimp on portions, when I see them giving so much more to the person in front of me. Not cool. I end up asking for more, but a lot of the times they give the tiniest bit more and roll their eyes if I ask again. I usually end up just asking for it on the side if I don't want to deal with it.\n\nI won't stop coming back to this place, but I also won't stop complaining to friends about how slow this place is either.
