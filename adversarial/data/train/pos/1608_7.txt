Oh my it was brunch time and still crackalizing! If you didn't understand that, it was packed! I wouldn't really suggest coming here in groups bigger than 4. Although, I'm sure you can it'll jus be a longer wait. \n\nI ordered the Kalua pig Benedict and my boyfriend ordered the adobo omelette. And together we ordered a short stack of red velvet pancakes as a dessert. That's how we get to try a little bit of every goodness. The kalua Benedict was perfect the way it was made. The yoke breaking over the meat and the crispy edges of the meat added a smokey hint to it. I tried some of the adobo omelet and it was good, but I've had bigger for the same price at aloha kitchen. On the other hand, the macaroni salad that came with it was unique with it's hint of crab meat. The red velvet pancakes was the perfect puzzle piece for my belly's satisfaction with it's sweet cream cheese syrup. \n\nThe service was on point and friendly. The parking is plenty. Be aware, it's disguised in an industrial area.\n\nI am most certainly filled and ready to come back to try the s'more pancakes.
