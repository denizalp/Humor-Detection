I second Caroline C.'s notion of sloppily made, over sized sushi rolls. \n\nAfter thoroughly enjoying the spicy salmon and x'mas rolls at the Coventry location, I thought I'd give the Solon location a shot...expecting to receive the same rolls. Unfortunately, the quality of the tuna differed, as did the proportions of rice (so much rice!), Many of the rolls were so loosely prepared that they fell apart when dipped in soy sauce. I also tried the Boston Roll, which was good in theory, but way larger than I could consume in one bite.
