I'm appalled this place has more than two stars!  The prices aren't bad, but the food is mediocre (and that's being nice).  However, if you're used to going to fast food for dinner, then yes this place does have higher prices.  As far as the nightlife goes... if your idea of a great night is seeing people that look like and act like they belong on the \"Jersey Shore,\" then this place is for you.
