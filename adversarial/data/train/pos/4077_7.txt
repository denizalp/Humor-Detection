If you don't like Crave, you are a monster. I'm sorry, I won't compromise on this one. I think I might commit assault for one of their red velvet numbers.\n\nI'm heartbroken to be in another city this fall, since it means that I'll miss the inevitable pumpkiny crave-of-the month in October. I wish they would add one of their pumpkin\/apple\/gingerbread seasonal cupcakes to the permanent list, although that would mean that my waistline would never recover.\n\nI'll also be unable to get a crave cake for my birthday, which is just a tragedy. Their cakes, by the way, are pretty much humankind's greatest achievement.\n\nTips: go early, they sell out fast, especially of red velvet and dark angel. The full size cupcakes are also kind of overwhelming; I prefer to get the mini cupcakes since the icing-to-cupcake ratio is better and you can get more flavors. If you have to get the full size cupcake, I'd advise sharing it with a friend or two, or skip a meal, cuz damn.
