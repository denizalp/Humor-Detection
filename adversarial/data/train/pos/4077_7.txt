This is all you need to know about the kind of service you'll get at Elite...those plastic pieces that go on the collar of mens shirts to keep the collar straight- they put new ones in every shirt, every time I have mine laundered or dry cleaned. They even put cufflinks in a shirt with French cuffs for me. Free of charge. That's outstanding. \n\nJeff is the rep who picks up dry cleaning and laundry at my office. I get everything back- delivered- within two days. Why would I ever go anywhere else for dry cleaning or laundry?
