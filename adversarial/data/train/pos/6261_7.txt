My wife and I decided to go outside of our comfort zone and try a new restaurant on Mayo Blvd. I give one star for the awesome patio and one star for the different playoff games on the TV. That's about as good as it gets.\n\nMaybe it's my fault for ordering something besides wings. But the burger was on the menu, so I guess it must be good, right? Wrong! I asked for a medium burger and it came out well done and very very salty. Now I'm a big boy and I do know how I want my burger cooked, MEDIUM. What is the restaurant worried about, people suing them for having the shits by eating a medium burger? Needless to say, I did not enjoy my meal.\n\nMy wife and I agree that we won't be returning since her chicken sandwich didn't measure up as well.
