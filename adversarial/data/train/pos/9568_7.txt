First time ever getting KBBQ outside of LA. I was kind of skeptical of the quality.\n\nThe taste of the food is actually really good. You also get your choice of meat (so many I forget what was there) and other dishes. Bonus is they have an area full of the pan chan (side dishes. don't know how to spell it :-P). I love being able to get as much kim chi as I want so I can grill it. \n\nOnly negative is you need to remember to get a separate plate for your meat. Unless you like having raw meat next to cooked food you're going to eat. Because of this, you end up with lots of plates on the table.\n\nAlso, considering we ate there at 1am, definitely not bad at all. Service was great, but might be because we were one of three parties there.
