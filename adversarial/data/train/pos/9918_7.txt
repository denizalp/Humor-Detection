The Palazzo Las Vegas is pretty awesome! It's been years since I've stayed here. Luckily for me my friend invited me along on a spur of the moment stay-cation kind of thing. I'm all about staying at luxury hotels so of course I accepted the offer. The whole Italian Renaissance theme that they offer throughout the hotel has always caught my eye!\n\nOne of the things that I like the most about this hotel is that it's an all-suites hotel! Yep! You definitely can't go wrong in booking whatever room that you choose here because they all will offer you a decent amount of space. If you are like me and those super small 300sq ft deluxe rooms bother you then The Palazzo is a perfect match for you. \n\nI literally stayed at the Venetian the night before and quickly remembered why these two properties are like brother and sister ha-ha! The room that we were booked in here at Palazzo reminded me a lot of the suite that we had stayed in at the Venetian. Seems though that the Palazzo is definitely going to offer you a more remodeled look that's for sure. The Fortuna suite offers you 940sq ft of pure luxury! I was just in heaven. Although we didn't get a Strip view the Pool View wasn't half bad. With booking this type of suite you are sure to receive either a Pool View or Strip View. Honestly you can't go wrong with either. \n\nOverall this one night stay was amazing! A bit of a tease but enough to make me actually come back and stay a little longer. The entire staff that we encountered from valet to front desk to housekeeping all provided excellent service. Cant wait to return in the near future!
