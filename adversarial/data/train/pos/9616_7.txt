NOTE: This review doesn't reflect the food or service. But honestly, I don't think it's meant to be for us to try this place. We have literally attempted to eat here THREE times already with no avail & we are f*cking tired of wasting our gas AND our time! \n\n1.) We came at 8:30pm on a Saturday & the hostess warned us that if we ate there, they would be closing in half an hour. I asked if that was a normal since Yelp & their doors say they close at 2:00am, and she said, \"No, just tonight. We are closing early at 9 tonight for a special occasion.\" Being our first time & planning to do all you can eat, we didn't want to be rushed & opted to eat somewhere else. Strike one. \n\n2.) We attempted to come again at 5:00pm on a Sunday. Yelp showed they were open so we headed over... only to find the doors locked & a handwritten schedule on the door with whiteout over Sunday that read, \"CLOSED ON SUNDAYS.\" This had to be new because the same information was on Yelp and on maps. Strike two. \n\n3.) And lastly... we drove over just now at 6:00pm on a Saturday. Checked Yelp and verified they are open until 2:00am... only to find the venue filled with construction and a note on the front door that says they are renovating until October 8th. Seriously? Seriously?! \n\nThree strikes, you're out. We give up now. Bye.
