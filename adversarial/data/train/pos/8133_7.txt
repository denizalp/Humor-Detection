Took the family (husband, 3 yr old son & 1 yr old daughter) for an \"early\" Saturday nite dinner out for \"family nite\". Called at 5pm to see if they take reservations - \"no, no hostess tonite\". \nGot there at 5:45 to get a little head start. We were 4th in line (no hostess, no wait list) and waited our turn that took about 1\/2 hr. \nWe were seated to then wait another 1\/2 hr with absolutely no acknowledgement of our presence. It was a bit frustrating to see the table seated after us drinking their sodas and eating their appetizers. Have I already mentioned I was there with 2 small children? \nI waved down one of the 3 waiters to let him know we still hadn't been brought water nor had our beverage order (let alone our food order) been taken. He told me he would \"take our table\" and be right back. 5 min later after checking on other tables and not returning to ours, we packed up the kids and left. \nMany guests still waiting for a table asked us if we ever got waited on...nope. They followed suit and left right behind us. \n Never got to try the food - just know it was probably the worst service we've ever encountered. Too bad.
