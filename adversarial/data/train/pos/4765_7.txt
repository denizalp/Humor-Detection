Mostly I'm a fan of the shoes (purrrrrrrrrrr) but I had never been to a CL store before so this was like the Holy Grail for me!  The store itself is not very big, but they have shoes here that some of the other stores may not have...then again, what each store may carry can vary widely as well.\n\nHubs - bless that mans heart - took me here for my birthday and turned me loose.  Saw some of the regular priced shoes and then my gaze turned upon the sale rack.  Oh baby!  Mind you  now....even on sale CL shoes are still up there in price.  The sales people were a bit snooty but I chose to ignore that  and went for a pair of peep toe slingbacks in a gorgeous apricot patent leather.  \n\nNow either she goofed or I goofed, but when I got back to the hotel I tried them on again and noticed they were a half size bigger than I normally wear.  Was not in the mood to return and argue (final sale) so I did my version of Victoria Beckham and just put a gel insert in the foot bed and kept on stepping!
