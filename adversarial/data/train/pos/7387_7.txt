Went here for a friends birthday. Great atmosphere OMG! So impressive. Hot waitresses. The downfall here was the food. It wasn't what I expected being in what seemed like such a big production of a restaurant. But the fun times and the atmosphere made up for it.\n\nRandomly we met one of the guys from B4-4 there. The girls I was with recognized him. Should I feel bad that I was the only person not bugging him for a picture and autograph? His girlfriend was cute though. Haha
