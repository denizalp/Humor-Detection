We drove all the way from Cali to try this place, well OK that's not entirely true, but while on vacation in Scottsdale we stopped by after reading so many great reviews on yelp. Walked in on a Saturday afternoon, and this place was empty. The hostess was super friendly and let us sample what ever we wanted as well as gave us pointers on what we should order since it was our first time there.\n\nI went with the cheese course duo (a pairing of Roquefort blue cheese and Arizona Medjool dates), and the peanut butter chip (slow churned Virginia peanuts and rich flakes of chocolate). All that I can say is AMAZING!! Everything about both flavors were perfect. The creaminess of the ice cream, the richness of the peanut butter, the way the dates balanced the tart blue cheese.  Mmmm. I really wished I lived closer so I could go back.\n\nAfter finishing our ice cream, we were invited to sample a flavor that was not out for sale that day. I don't know how she knew that I was a bacon lover, but she let us sample a carmel bacon swirled ice cream.... *sigh*  it was good.
