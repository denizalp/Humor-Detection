My husband and I really wanted to like this place. We were previously pretty dedicated to Montesano's as our regular pizza place and, like apparently a lot of people, desperate to find a suitable replacement -- that it would be located in the exact same space would just be a convenient bonus. \n\nUnfortunately, the search continues. :-\/\n\nWe did a large half cheese\/half pepperoni, it was just over $16 (there's a $1 charge for take out, apparently, which is...fine ¯\\_(ツ)_\/¯) and it was incredibly mediocre. I think the photo kind of speaks for itself, but it was basically the taste\/look of a pizza they'd serve in a high school cafeteria. It definitely is pizza, but it's not really what you wanted. \n\n(It's about the same level of fulfillment as Blaze, just down the street, in my opinion. Definitely not the  new regular spot I was so ardently hoping for.)\n\nThe guy that answered the phone was super nice and the staff inside was nice, and it's possible that their actual entrees are where they excel and the pizza is just an afterthought, but for our experience, and what we were looking for them to do, it comes up pretty short.
