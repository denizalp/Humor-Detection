This club is the worst club we have ever been to. My sister got her phone stolen and the security and bouncers here seriously have no idea what is going on. Nobody knows where security is, nobody knows where lost and found is. This was one of the most frustrating experiences ever. I heard many people have lost or have had their phones stolen here before and now my sister has experienced this herself. Do not go here unless you want your stuff stolen.
