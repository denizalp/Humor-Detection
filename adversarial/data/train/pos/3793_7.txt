A little confusing to find as it is located in a complex of buildings one of which is a coffee shop. I have had this place on my radar for a while. I had some time to kill early on a Sunday morning so I stopped in. Normally it is ridiculously crowded, but early on a Sunday it wasn't the case.\nUpon arrival you order at the counter like a fast food joint. They being out your order minuets later.\nI ordered the Huevos de Farm Grill. This is scrambled eggs, cheese, and pulled pork in a verde sauce. It came with a side of fried tortillas and farmer beans. \nThe main dish was ok. The color was less than appealing. It was green and with everything mixed together it looked gross. I put a little barbeque sauce on it. It changed the color a bit and added a nice smoky sweetness. The beans I could have done without. Not much flavor, but Tabasco helped out. \nTo be fair, the wait staff was great and I did order Huevos de Farm Grill for the first time. It was ok, just not something I was crazy about. Next time I will order from my comfort zone. The burger and onion rings look like a winner.
