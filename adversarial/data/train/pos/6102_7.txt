Wow.  What to say about the disappointing dinner at Sukho Thai.  It's like being a kid and seeing a present shaped like a guitar that you've been coveting under the tree, to only find upon opening that it's your grandmother's hand-me-down robe.  It's really that disappointing.   \n\nWhen its extremely crowded upstairs, they have creepy seating downstairs in the basement.  Great.  The menu is extremely limited.  You have two noodle dishes, four curries and two random entrees to choose from.  \n\nI ordered the Sukho Pad Thai (when I asked why it was different than regular Pad Thai, I was told there were \"special spices\", peanuts and lime mixed in.  Sounds like normal Pad Thai to me...) combo meal.  This was supposed to come with a salad and drink.  When I asked if vegetables could be mixed in (fiber please?), I was told they didn't have any.  *sigh*  My husband ordered the beef entree that came with jasmin rice as a combo as well.  \n\nThe salad was julienned mango, cucumber and peppers in rice wine vinegar in the smallest bowl i've ever seen.  \n\nWhen our entrees came out, we were starving.  The \"special spices\" on my Pad Thai was lots of salt...and something funky.  My husband's beef was also pretty salty.  His came with an egg that looked like it was fried last week.  We ate as much as possible to avoid passing out in Regent Park, asked for it to go and left.  We trashed it once we realized even a bum wouldn't go there.  \n\nI haven't tried the curries.  They could be the mind blowing and totally authentic somewhere in Thailand, but don't expect Bangkok.  You'll probably get Chiang Mai.  With that said, our search for our favorite Thai restaurant continues....
