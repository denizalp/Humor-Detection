Shack attack! \n\nFrom the first time we set foot in Chicken Shack to the present, it's been our favorite place for wings.  I have a catch phrase of 'Shack Sunday' because we always come here to get our wings during football season.  They open at 10 so it's perfect for game time. They are located off of Sunset in the Smiths shopping plaza so it's easy to find with ample parking.  \n\nNow let's get down to business- the wings here have stayed consistently huge, succulent and flavorful.  They offer a huge variety of sauces for the wings.  All are great.  The hot sauce and the honey habanero are our favorites.  You can choose to have them tossed in the sauce or on the side.  Tip- if you're carrying out, get the sauce on the side and toss them yourself when you get home. \n\nI hate to leave out mentioning the over addicting shoestring fries.  They do not skimp on these tasty sides.  The BBQ baked beans are also a favorite of mine. It's always a tough choice of mine which side to get.  \n\nCustomer service is reliably top notch. They treat us like one of their friends every time.  They are always friendly and make a point to say hi even during a busy time.  I always appreciate their kindness as well as the amazing food.  \n\nAny day is always a great day for wings!
