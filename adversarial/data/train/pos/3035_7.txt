Their cappuccino is the best thing can ever have in Montreal. I fell in love with their cannoli, super nice and fresh. They have a verity of pastries and delicacies but their cannoli is the best I tried so far.  \nThey got the shop beside hem and they have a larger room inside where you can have your coffee.
