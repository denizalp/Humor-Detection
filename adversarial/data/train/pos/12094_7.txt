I know the Northeast Ohio area has the Metroparks (of which we should be pretty darn grateful- massive park systems are cool), but I have a special love for Edgewater.  Not that special love that is dirty flavored that no one talks about...but more like on a day when the weather is just right, Edgewater is the best place to be in the city.\n\nThere's something about the feeling of walking down that hill from the park to the beach that washes over you.  It's a \"Clevelandy\" feeling.  You're in a city, but there's still nature around you.  Bigger cities miss that.  And Edgewater is a reminder that there are cool places to go within city limits.\n\nGranted, yes, Edgewater has some of its sketchy moments as well, so use your noggin' if you want to do the exercise path at twilight.  And no, I don't think I'd go swimming in the Lake there.  Once I had a friend that supposedly went for a swim there after hours, got in trouble from the po-po's, and as he was getting out of the water apparently saw a rotten deer carcus in the water.  i'm hoping that's a big ol' lie.  and yeah, there are sometimes sketchy men hanging out by the bathrooms or others cars that i'd like to avoid.\n\nwait, this review was soooo not supposed to be slammin edgewater.\n\ni enjoy edgewater.  i like sitting on the rocks and writing in my journal.  i like the people flying kites in the field by the beach, i like how there's picnics always going on in the summer, and i just like it.\n\npeople can complain about cleveland not effectively using their shoreline, but i think edgewater is pretty neat.\n...and if they tear it up to put in a freeway, wayne brady is gonna have to cut a b*&@#.
