When u walk in, the line may seem super long but it actually moves quite quickly. Got to the front in about 10-15 mins. This review is based on my 3rd time visiting this location. I got the Shack Stack the first two times and I got the Chick'n Shack my last time here. I gave it two stars because I was not impressed with the burgers at all. This place is way over hyped. \n\n-1 star for the price. This place is freaking expensive for a tiny burger. I can pay the same amount and a little bit more for a gourmet burger at a restaurant. \n\n-1 star for the presentation. The Chick'n Shack looked like a McChicken from MickeyDs which I can get for $2. I paid $6 for this. \n\n-1 star for the taste. The burger doesn't taste as fresh as it looks on the pictures. The ingredients seems to be lacking. \n\nOverall, this place reminds my friends and I of an up-scaled McDonald. I rather go to McDonald than here haha. I probably won't return next time i'm in Vegas.
