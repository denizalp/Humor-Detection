OMG I am SO HIGH RIGHT NOW!! I am definitely not low. I think I accidentally quoted Harold And Kumar Go To White Castle unintentionally. Despite the reference. I am not on any illegal substances I'm just commenting on how I'm about 50 stories above the ground. Much higher than some other surrounding Casinos. \n\nUsually, I'm too cheap to try something like these, but what the heck can't say no to 2 for 1 admission coupons. Besides, what are you going to do in Vegas during the daytime? And if you said sleep. You, my friend are missing out. After enjoying a delicious Paris buffet, I figure why not let's check out the Eiffel Tower while in Paris. Surprisingly, the view looked nothing like Paris but more like a land of potential or as my friend likes to call it \"broken dreams\". \n\nI admit I was a bit scared of the elevator ride up. It felt like Charlie and Chocolate factory and it is a lot higher than I thought it would be. My friend also added, \"This is fun. So when do we drop?\". HAHA! I guess it wouldn't be funny if it really happened, but I guess too many roller coasters and movies might give you some ideas. I manage to make it safely up and down the Tower. You get a great birds eye view from a birdcage. Remember to bring your camera so you can be like everyone else and look Tourist-y. :) I only had my cellphone camera so no long distance pics for me. \n\nWhen you go up to the top. Take your time and get your money's worth. You don't have to walk much. Just find a nice place to chill and relax. I don't recommend this for anyone scared of heights, because I did see a few people get off the elevator and head back down a second later. Great way to spend 10 or 14 bucks. Also, no alchie allowed :(. I ended having to chug a friends tall Margarita before going up the elevator, but it was okay because I just had breakfast. Besides I was feeling GOOOOD =). I still want to go back to see the Vegas skyline at night next time. Try it out and look for coupons!
