After the waitress came to us, she quickly left for 5+ minutes with no explaination. After asking about what was in the veggie burger, the waitress replied that she did not no. She didn't find out for me, just told me that they get the veggie burgers frozen from another company. My dad and I ended up ordering the wychwood burger, i with sweet potato fries and him with regular. The sweet potato fries were fine, and the burger itself was quite good. My mom ordered the fish and chips and couldn't finish them because the fish was definitely frozen and watery. The only saving grace was the burger.
