I'll keep this short and sweet (like how I take my espressos). The coffee, location and aesthetic all receive full marks here. No question. I mean they wouldn't have expanded as quickly as they have in Toronto if they didn't have these things nailed down. \n\nWhere they fell short was in some basic service areas.\n\nThe Wifi, not one of my 3 devices was able to connect (phone, tablet, laptop), none. I was coming here to enjoy a cuppa Americano and do some work but that became quickly apparent that wasn't going to happen.\n\nFurther to this, no plugs for laptop or phone charging... like anywhere. Not even a little bebe plug for 2 min. I understand it's to motivate turnover but come on... daddy needs to earn his pay folks. A little wifi and a power bar in the back wouldn't hurt.\n\nLastly seating - is this for people under 5'2? I felt like my 6 ft frame had to do some auto-bot type transformer shifting to squirrel into one of their tables. I mean they look hella cool, but I was short fall away from a Yoga class, imagine if I was taller (or more rotund?). \n\nAt the end of the day this is a laundry list of #firstworldproblems, and their coffee is good, next time, I'm coming with a fully charged laptop, setting up my personal hotspot (on my phone) and bringing in my own recliner for seating. \n\nLast note - that patio is pretty sweet, next time Dark Horse, next time!
