DISGUSTING\n\nI had hoped the pizza would have been a nice change from the chain stores.\nBoy was i wrong.\n\nI got 2 pizzas. I will describe each one separately. We got the pizzas to go. I live about 1.5 miles from the store.\n\nThe Margherita.\nAs soon as i opened the box, i knew it was garbage. Imagine a piece of dough, SMOTHERED in sauce, with about 5 blobs of cheese on it. I dont know where this is considered pizza, but im glad i do not live there. The pizza was cold.  the crust was undercooked, and was stuck to the butcher paper in the box.  Even after re-cutting the entire pizza, when me or my kids tried to pull a pice out, all the sauce and cheese( If that piece actually had cheese on it, because yes, some slices didnt have any cheese at all)  just slid into the box, leaving us with a flimsy, cold piece of dough.\nEPIC FAIL\n\nThe Patagonian.\nThis pizza was just a shard better, as far as flavors go.\nBut, it also was cold, undercooked, and stuck to the paper in the box.\n\nAnd lets not forget the prices. LMAO!!  I thought Papa Johns was over priced.  Florencia has them beat, hands down! I do not know what you are paying for, but i DO know that i will NEVER give them another penny, and i will do my best to let as many people know about this failure as i can.
