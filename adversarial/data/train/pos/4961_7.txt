There's overrated and then there's Au Pied De Cochon. Worshipped by the New York Times, celebrity chefs, and self-described \"foodies\", Au Pied De Cochon has the reputation for being one of the best restaurants in the city.  It's undeserved. Here's my theory as to why the hype: it's greasy and unhealthy comfort food dressed up as haute cuisine for so-called foodies who claim to like fine dining when in reality they secretly crave greasy and unhealthy comfort food. In other words, it's fast food for pretentious people with big wallets. For all the ink that's been spilled over chef Martin Picard's \"masterful synthesis \"of the high and the low (a fusion of fine dining with blue collar working class grub), a poutine dressed up in foie gras is still just a poutine (only with more fat and cholesterol).  Call me unimpressed.
