This mall is just sad.\n\nIt's has the kind of parking lot where you can drive through parking spaces without hitting any cars.\n\nI think most of the \"customers\" here are people that work at this mall.  Many (and I really mean many!) of the stores are closed.\n\nThere was nothing notable about this mall that would make it worth visiting. Our first and only visit was because we didn't know any better. I can't imagine any reason to go back.  Unless you want to see what a mall looks like after almost everything has shut down for the night.
