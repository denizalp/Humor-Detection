This place is pretty cool and tasty. Inside has an industrial rustic vibe with a cool patio outside when the weather permits. Two large glass garage style doors can be opened up to the patio when it's time to party.\n\nThe ingredients here are very fresh and are better than what you get when ordering delivery. They have 5 different sauces, 3 different crust types, and several different cheeses that you can select. They even have a gluten free version and some vegan options. Nice!\n\nThe pizzas are about 11\" and are cooked super fast in their very hot oven. It was fun to watch them make the pizza right in front of your eyes. They will build it however you want or you can go with any of their signature pies.\n\nHad to try one of the Spicy Butcher Pizzas while the wife went with a Margherita with fresh mozzarella. They both came out in 10 minutes or less and were brought straight to the table. The tenderness of the crust and the perfect balance of toppings made it a yummy treat and tasty good.\n\nThey also have Starters, Salads, Sweet Tooths, and cool selection of Beers and Wines. Right next to Sprout's and in the same parking lot as Out-N-In. See ya there next time. CHEERS!\n\n4.5 STARS
