Food was okay, but the steak was a little too dry and undercooked. My waitress was very rude and would attempt to get my boyfriend an I to sing a birthday song to her. Who does that? Very busy and staff was impolite. I don't recommend coming here if you are looking for good steak and friendly service. (Cotton candy was good, though!)
