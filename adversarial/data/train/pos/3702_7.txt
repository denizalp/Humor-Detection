I have been in some dumps before but this one was takes the cake! The only good thing is they allow \"pets\". Did a couple prisoner watch details in here for a federal contract. Great for me ; ) Next day, brought my German Shepard in. This place has gotta be a trucker's nightmare. A dump. Roaches, ticks or bedbugs, hair in the sheets and cigarette burns all over the furniture and bathroom sink \/ toilet cover. Very hard for anyone to sleep soundly as you hear big rigs coming and going all the time plus the usual prostitutes or \"lot lizards\". Tweekers run amok at night so lock your stuff up securely.
