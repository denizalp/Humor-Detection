I really wanted to give this place that 4th star, but the customer service in here was lacking. \n\nDon't get me wrong it wasn't terrible, but the two fellas behind the counter seemed a little disjointed. When I first walked in they were trying to figure out how to get someone's tab settled; either the machine wasn't working, they didn't know how to use it, or just plain forgot to charge the customer in the first place. It also seemed like only one of the two bartenders knew how to work cash register. During this time of \"transaction confusion\" my friend and I sat there just looking around waiting to be helped. This was probably just a few minutes, but at least throw me a menu or give a brief cocktail rundown while you're waiting to settled someone's tab. Just a thought.\n\nBeyond this little hiccup, which I'm assuming doesn't happen that often, the drinks were actually pretty good. Oak & Ivy has a great selection of whiskey, which they should, being this is a Whiskey Based Craft Cocktail lounge. I didn't order a craft cocktail, but decided to go with a glass of Four Roses Single Barrel whiskey on the rocks, I could have sipped these bad boys all night! My partner in crime went with the \"Sazerac\", a Peychaud's soaked sugar cube crushed in a house blend misted bucket and stirred with Bulleit Rye. I didn't try a sip of this and now as I write this, I'm kicking myself. Next time Oak & Ivy, next time. \n\nBesides the brief brain fart in customer service at the beginning of this experience, Oak & Ivy is that little gem you might pass by as you wander through Container Park. So stop, turn around, and plant your butt for crafty cocktail.
