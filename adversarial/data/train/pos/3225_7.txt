I learned a new word last night!\n\nTasti:  adj.  definition: opposite of tasty.  synonyms: bland, flavorless, gross.\n\nThe caramel pecan I sampled had absolutely no flavor, so I went with the chocolate\/vanilla twist, hoping it would resemble a typical chocolate\/vanilla twist flavor.  I added mini m&ms, my usual go-to yogurt topping, for 75 cents.  WOW: 12 mini m&ms.  I'm not even kidding.  I guess that's one way to keep things low cal and maximize profits!  This so-called tasti treat tastes like whipped up air mixed with skim milk or chemicals or something.\n\nThe custom-made \"100s of flavors\" only come in pretty large sizes so I wasn't able to try them.  I guess if you add enough toppings maybe you could ignore the fact that the main ingredient (the frozen crap) doesn't taste anything like yogurt or ice cream or anything else for that matter.  \n\nOh, and customer service?  Forget it.  We got there 2 minutes after 9:00 and they still let us in (seemed nice at the time) and then proceeded to glare at us the whole time we were there.  The funny thing was, there were three people behind the counter (owner dad and his two kids?  manager and two high school workers?  maybe both) and the two that weren't helping us were just standing around, so it didn't look like we were really holding them up too much.  Excuse us for bothering you; don't worry, I won't be back.
