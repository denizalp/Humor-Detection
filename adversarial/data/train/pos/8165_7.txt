Omg!!! This place is just top notch. Everything in the room was luxurious. The room service lady was such a sweet heart. She clean both beds with new sheets, pillows, and blankets because one of the girl made a mess. She even change all the towels. :) The service in the front hotel desk has great customer service and so does all the dealers and management on the casino floors. Would love to come back and stay here again. By the way... The room was free. Which made it even better.
