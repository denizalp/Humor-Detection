I recently worked on my first job through MovieWork Now, as an extra in a commercial. It more than paid for the 6 month membership that I had purchased (I already had my own headshots, which I was able to upload onto their website). \n\nOnce you sign up with MovieWork, you will receive emails for casting opportunities. I answered one for this particular commercial casting and received an email about a week later, stating that I was cast in the project. There were 15 extras total working on this project, as well as two principals, all cast through MovieWork Now. \n\nPatrice and Annie were professional to work with and kept me in the loop with detailed emails about the shoot location, call times, set etiquette, etc. I was impressed with how well organized they were. \n\nI am excited to continue working with MovieWork Now and would definitely recommend them to others.
