I understand they are a new place so I'm cutting the guys in the back some slack... I got the 808 bowl and didn't think it was flavorful. It was ok. It didn't blow my mind and my taste buds like other places. I already knew after paying for my food I was going to be disappointed. My instincts were right. Everything was ok, but I prefer the other guys because they are more seasoned and know what they are doing and what customers like. He portions are also smaller here. For that same price you can get more for your money at the other guys. :) I'll give them another shot in a month or so to see if anything has improved. If not, back to SOHO I go.
