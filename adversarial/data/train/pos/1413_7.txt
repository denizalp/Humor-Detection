This place would be so much better if I had signed up for month to month instead of the year contract. I really liked this little place a lot in the beginning. Than again, it wasn't filled with as many people back then. It just seems like lately that every time I go in there, it is crowded to the point where it can get  a bit claustrophobic. Good for the owner that more people are signing up, but it also makes moving around and getting to do the things you want to do a lot more challenging. \n\nThis place might be alright if you go during off-peak times, but if you do go during busier times, it can be tough. It is still okay. I just learned the hard way that the bigger places are more for me..and because of that 1 year contract, I'm nailed to this place for another 7 months. Meh.\n\n3 stars.
