Both stars are for loose slots.\n\nThis is a place the locals hang out because you may break even more times than not.\n\nMy 84 year old aunt(a local)swears by this place.\n\nNow the bad,looks and smells like an ashtray.\n\nThe people here are rejects from the bar scene in Star Wars.\n\nFat ladies in wheelchairs,with oxygen tanks,smoking pack after pack ,show you where your Medicare dollars go.\n\nThe dregs and cretins of humanity ,trying to forget that life sucks, by staying drunk and occasionally winning at video poker,are the clientele that visit this place.
