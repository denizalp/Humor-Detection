I have to remember that this place is it should be non-profit, so recourses are low....\n\nI'm all about being frugal and I love a bargain.  My girls like to stop in after we drop off donations.  They found a few gems like - High Waist Throw Back Mom Jeans: Versace or a brand new w\/ Tags graphic tee shirts.\n\nMy gripe is that the store is crowded with the clothes so crammed in that you can barely move them to see what they have.  Also, some of their jeans are priced d too high for 2nd hand \"donations\"... and most important is that they seemingly do not Lysol the garments before they put them out.... the store is musty :-\/\n\n* Staff is always nice
