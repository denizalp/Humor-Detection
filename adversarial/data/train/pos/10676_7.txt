We ordered 2 AYCE on a friday night for $55.\n\n- Wait time was long for 2 people. We ended up shopping at CVS to pass the 30min wait.\n- Service was fast at the sushi bar. Bon hooked it up! always delivered the sushi right away!\n- Asian waitress had stick up her ass. Even if you leave a tiny bit of rice, they will threaten to charge you. \n- Hamachi kama, soft shelf crab, and fried mussels were all too oily. I had to drink way too much water O__O\n- Rolls were decent. Not as good as goyemon. \n- Mochi ice cream ALL OUT tonight!? boooo\n- ice cream better than sushi mon. plum ice cream and small bits of it :)\n-  Salmon skin roll has avocado?! pretty good :)! kinda oily :\/
