Wow! Let me say that again...WOW!!!  This place is so good and it's going to be the cause of me gaining a million pounds since it's so close to my house. This was my first time here, I had no clue that this place was here. The owner told me that they've been here for two years!! I've been missing out for two years! This place is located in the Bashas shopping center, it's sort of behind the Taco Bell. So skip that junk and head straight on over to Ezekiel's!!\n\nI had the Fried Chicken Dinner that comes two pieces of chicken, two sides and cornbread. I got their mac and cheese and french friends. I can hear my arteries clogging, but it's worth it!! The chicken breast was huge and it was super juicy. The breading tasted delicious and crispy. The cornbread. Super super moist, sweet and tasty. I really can't tell you how amazing this chicken is, words don't do it justice. You have to come experience this fried goodness for yourself. The mac and cheese will make your toes curl. No joke. I wish I was joking, but I'm not. I'm as serious as a heat attack. They make that delicious cheesy goodness there and it's baked. \"whaaaa?!\" you say. yup. It's baked there. The fries were really good too. I don't know what sort of fairy dust they sprinkled on them, but they had me at spud. \n\nThe owners are so friendly and easy going. They made you feel welcome and knew how to treat a customer. \n\nIf you want some real good food, I mean some REALLY good food, your search is over, my friends. I must warn you, your taste buds will never be the same. This is like taking the red pill...there's no going back. Your eyes will be opened to what good soul food is all about.
