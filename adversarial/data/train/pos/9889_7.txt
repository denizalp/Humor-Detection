The best part of Green Bing is watching them prepare your food. The crepe is made on top of hot stone in a circular shape and an egg is cracked on top and spread out. Then your stuffing is added. \n\nWe chose their traditional style which had green onions, sesame seeds, Romain lettuce, and wonton crisps. They also added hoisin sauce for flavor. However, this dish reminded me of mushu pork probably because the hoisin sauce. Everything including the lettuce, egg, and crepe was fresh and tasty but the hoisin seemed really out of place. I am looking forward to trying their meat fillings next time.
