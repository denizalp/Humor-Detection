My facorite location, after a few days non stop drinking in Vegas, I really need salty food to absorb leftover alcohol in me to feel slightly better...I've always liked the decor and seatings here.\n\nThe hangover cure food I usually like to order: \nChang's vegetarian lettuce wraps, made with tofu: so yummy, no matter how hangover I am, I still need veggies ;p \n\nHot & Sour soup, chicken, tofu, bamboo shoots, egg & mushrooms, balanced with hot white pepper and vinegar: this is a MUST for hangover! Always makes me much better.... Very delicious\n\nPepper steak, marinated flank steak tossed with yellow onion, red & green peppers in a garlic and black pepper sauce: hubby's favorite\n\nHunan-style hot fish, Crispy slices of tilapia in a tangy, spicy sauce with stir- fried vegetables: Spicy spicy spicy, only way for bad hangover! \n\nI like all those dishes with Taingtao beer, service is always good. Funny I like Americanized Chinese food much better than authentic Chinese food, I like salty sometime for some reasons, but never greasy and oily, P.F.Chang food is salty without greasy, just what I need & love sometime! ;p
