I organized this tour for some Tepper class mates. It certainly did not disapoint!\n\nTo start, you sample some really interesting cocktails, of the likes I have not seen before. I had the Popeye, which was spinach and some other ingredients mixed with Rye. I could have grabbed my girlfriend and proclaimed her Olive Oil after that.\n\n\nThroughout a wonderful history lesson, punctuated with dry humor, we were led back in the 1700's and the plight of Mr. Wigle. \n\nFollowing that, there was a tasting of varieties of spirits, from Rye, to Wheat, to the OG Gin recipe. \n\nThis is a wonderful and innovative addition to Pittsburgh, and the tour is 100% awesome!
