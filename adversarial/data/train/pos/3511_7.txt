First of all, walking into a nightclub and seeing men with missing teeth, more African men than I've seen on the GEO channel and the Go-Go dancers that need to go on a Kardashian Quick Trim \"rush\" diet ... it was sad. I thought, \"Why are they up there dancin' and need a diet plan.\" So we walked to the bar and tried to get a drink. The glorified bartender had an attitude so we waited. The birthday girl goes to the corner of the bar and tries to get a drink while three of the girls head upstairs to get their groove on. I looked over to see someone up in the birthday girl's face and I tagged one of the other girls and the other girl looked over ... IT WAS ON! One of the girls SNATCHED the girl's wig and it went flying across the bar. We honestly thought time stood still cause we were like \"OHHHH!\" All I know is 20 seconds later we were the main attraction on the dance floor and it was me, T, Stach, and Sheen ... about 10 bouncers came outta no where, jumped in and broke it up. It happened in a flash. SO! We had to wait it out in the lobby and then walked to the SUV and drove back to Scottsdale. Turns out we were in SOUTH Chandler. I said, \"Any city with the word \"South\" is always bad news.\" So that's how we ended the night. A lot of scratches and bruises but I'm still trying to obtain the video footage of this memorable night. I know ... unexpected. We keep laughing everytime we think about the girl's face when her wig got snatched. Stach ... girrrrrl! LOL!!!
