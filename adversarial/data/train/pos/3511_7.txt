Food is as you would expect , good but on the average side.  Long ago I ordered salmon which they grill on the wood fire.  MIstake.  well done and super dry.   that being said my favorite thing on the menu is actually the kobe beef sliders.  I don't know if they are actually kobe beef but I find them tasty albeit somewhat reminiscent of White Castle!
