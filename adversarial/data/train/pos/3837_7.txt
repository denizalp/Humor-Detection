Fuck this place for closing at 6 all the sudden rather than 10 as published, sending me back into the cold snow without a hot chocolate. If you don't like the winter, go back to Portland.\n\nBusinesses that establish and publish standard business hours, then violate them at will, are disrespecting their customers. Seeya at Starbucks!
