Islington used to be the termination end point of the west end of the Bloor-Danforth line until Kipling was built back in 1980.  Islington does have a parking lot but it is tiny when compared to Kipling's multiple lots.\n\nTTC buses that run out of here are only 3, the 37 Islington (Islington station to Finch), 50 Burnhamthorpe (Islington station to Mill Road) and 110 Islington south (Islington station to Long Branch loop).  Besides the TTC the Mi-Way (Mississauga transit) buses also use Islington as a depot but the systems are not connected by fares.  To ride from one system to another there is an additional fare required.\n\nFor entry into the station for Mississauga transit to board the buses you must pay a TTC fare.  In order to not pay the TTC fare to board the Mi-Way you must board the Mi-Way outside of the station.\n\nThe subway platform for Islington is undivided that is you can access either east or westbound trans from the single middle platform for either train.  The ground level of the station is very large and open.  \n\nThere is an entry for both the main station at the north west corner of Islington and Bloor as well as stairs leading down on the north east corner (Shipp Centre) side.
