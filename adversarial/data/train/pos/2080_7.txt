Everyone told me that this place rivaled our infamous In n Out burger... so I went. I was told to order the shack stack. It contains a portabella mushroom stuffed with melting cheese, inside a cheese burger. It definitely tickled my fancy. I got in line and took a look at the menu and noticed that there were no combos. You had to order everything a la carte. What the hell kind of burger place is this?!?! The burger costs about $10, the fries were about $3, and the drink was about $3. My total came out close to about $20. Strike 1 for Shake Shack. \n\nI received my food, and the party I was with, all said the same thing... \"this is a small ass burger for 10 bucks.\" It really was. And it was really greasy as well. Strike 2. \n\nI began to masticate my burger and nothing really hit me as... WOW. This was my first shake shack experience, and there was no emotions that stirred within me, unlike my first In n Out burger. Strike 3. \n\nI didn't order any of the shakes there because I'm lactose intolerant, but a few of my friends did, and no one raved about them. The only thing they mentioned was that the cups were freaking tiny for what they paid. \n\nOverall, it's overpriced, no combos, small portions, no wow factor, means I wouldn't go back. In N Out definitely wins out in every way.
