If I ever want to be ignored and appear to annoy the staff by wanting to spend my money I stop in this bakery. Been in this bakery a few times because they have a delicious coconut mouse cake but I'm going to ditch this treat from now on because the people who work in this establishment obviously don't want any business. Hello is not in their vocabulary, thank you is deaf to their ears and goodbye is a foreign language. So, nope. Don't shop here.
