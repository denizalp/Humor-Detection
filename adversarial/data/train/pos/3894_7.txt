I finally decided to try this place out, despite the mix reviews I keep hearing about them.  I figured if WFNZ is promoting them, it can't be all that bad.  Now, besides all that, I had a $10 off coupon, and had just got back in town from the beach and was thinking this place had better be good because there will be no cooking in my household today.  I think this place is more of a bar than a restaurant since it's Sunday and the only 2 people here were not eating but watching football.....not a good sign but I stayed and ordered the pork chops, and hamburger steak, both came with 2 sides and a roll.  I must admit that everything was really good:\n\nPork chops-3.5 stars(a bit too much salt)\nHamburger steak-4 stars\nMac n cheese-4 stars\nGreen beans-3.5 canned\nGreens-3.5 canned(very sweet)\nRice-4 stars\n\nI did hear the server say that the cook that was there today was the best cook on staff.   I would probably frequent this place if I lived closer, but I would return.
