Located in the plaza with Target, you will find Cafe Verdi hidden on the same side as GameStop and Sally's. Luckily, this place is opened 24\/7 and also delivers 24\/7 (though I haven't used that service). At night, it will be difficult to find as their sign doesn't have a light on.\n\nWe walked in and ordered a 16\" pizza, half cheese and half spicy chicken. My boyfriend also ordered a Verdi burger and we got a 1 liter of soda. The total cost was $25... Seemed kind of pricey to me. \n\nFood 2\/5\nWe sat down at the table and waited for about 20 minutes before the food came. While I was eating, I had realized that this pizza was just mediocre. The portion is very large so I only had two slices. I also took a bite of the burger and it was mediocre as well.  Nothing special, but wasn't disgusting. \n\nService 3\/5\nNothing noteworthy about service. The guys there were helpful but the environment seemed extremely casual and some employees seemed clueless. We asked for ranch and never got it, but the guys seem nice. \n\nThis place isn't a place I would recommend or come back to unless it was convenient. Because it is 24\/7 with delivery too, it seems like that would be the only time I use their service. Otherwise, nope!
