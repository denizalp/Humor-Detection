I don't know what was going on in this little ol' head of mine when I gave Pinball Hall of Fame only four stars previously.  Maybe it was because I was new to Yelp and I was trying to save my five stars for only the most elite places?  Maybe I was suffering from Lindsay Lohan exhaustion and wasn't thinking clearly?  Obviously, something was wrong.\n\nWell I'm reporting to you again to say that the Pinball Hall of Fame is one of the coolest places in Vegas and definitely worth five stars.  Unless your some punk that is only into being a bro and spends more time on your hair than the average woman.  Stay away from here if you are.  It's not worth your precious hair-styling time.\n\nAnd not only is this place super cool and tons of fun and a cheap way to spend an afternoon, but they've also improved it!  It's cleaner, brighter, and the bathroom is now ok to use!  There are still a few broken machines but they've been banished to one corner of the building hopefully awaiting the chance where they can be fixed and played like the rest of the games.\n\nFun for kids, pinball enthusiasts, and non-bros.  Plus, 100% of the proceeds to go charity so you get to be a do-gooder while having fun!  Nothing beats that.
