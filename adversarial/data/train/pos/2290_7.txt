This event was super upscale and classy! I had to come late due to my new work schedule, but Lindsey D. & the crew at The Capitol Grille were very accommodating! My favorite app was the scallop and really enjoyed ALL the wine tastings we received! We also had a meat\/steak course and everything was delectable! It was nice to meet the head executive chef! Lindsey D. and everyone who helped put this event really knocked my socks off! I cannot wait for the next Elite event!
