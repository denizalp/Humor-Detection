Walking in here. I thought I'd end up waiting for hours to see a doctor. Place would be smelly or the nurses would be rude.\n\nI was surprised that everyone was so so nice! They attend to me immediately. Even the nurses were nice. It's 2am and the staff is just so kind. I feel safe coming here. I feel like they can great me and not just put a band aid and send me off.
