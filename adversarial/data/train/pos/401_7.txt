Mid-century modern light fixtures, rich red leather booths, dimmed lighting, and televisions showing classic black and white films from the 40s and 50s- Siegel's tries (and mostly succeeds) at establishing a classy retro atmosphere. The menu encompasses breakfast and dinner specials, a series of \"sandwiches of the world\", and a $19.41 steak dinner, which makes Siegel's not what I expected. The atmosphere is geared more toward a steakhouse, but is instead utilized as a diner. \n\nThe $19.41 steak dinner includes a salad (heads up, the house vinaigrette is a creamy version), sliced sirloin served topped with steak sauce (usually not  something I like, but nicely zesty here),  heap of fresh fries, and a bread plate (which never materialized). The Tuesday dinner special is a country-fried steak with mashed potatoes and vegetables, which was generously sized and solid for the low $11 price tag. We couldn't resist adding on a bowl of their matzoh ball soup with challah, which was surprisingly meaty for $8. \nWe wanted to share a dessert, but upon asking to see the menu, we were handed our bill- guess that makes the decision for us, huh?\n\nUnfortunately, the subpar service kind of ruined it for me. Regulars were enthusiastically greeted, and we were helped in a polite and competent manner, but odd delays (20 minutes between courses, 10 to run our card, the dessert thing) made things a bit frustrating. The location and decor lend this space the potential to be a higher-end restaurant, if they kicked up the menu and retrained the staff.
