We stayed at Treasure Island and decided to catch the Cirque du Soleil show since it was performing in the hotel. We had a good deal on the tickets since Treasure Island was advertising a package deal. We got there a half and hour early and the pre-show had a comedy skit which was hilarious. The show had great amazing performances and the live music really kept us entertain. There were a few comedy skits in between shows which was filled with laughter. Our favorite performance was the two men lifting each other with all their STRENGTH! The show was great, but it was not WOW. I had seen better, but would like to check the KA and O show in the future.
