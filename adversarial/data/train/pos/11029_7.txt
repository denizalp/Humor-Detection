I want to give this place 4 stars based solely on food.....BUT....the manager is extremely annoying. I get it Fox restaurants tend to train their staff to be friendly and they definitely have a script they are required to follow, but my last visit here with my son left a bitter taste in my mouth. The manager was standing at the head of the line talking to customers and directing them as to which side to go to....order in or take out. It was really busy (not a big deal to me btw because I love the food and it's worth it). What irked me was that he was telling the customers in front of me how someone complained about him (can't recall if it was on yelp or through the website?) and kept going ON and ON about it complaining that it had happened! To be honest I understood why. I've been here several times and felt he was annoying (sitting down with diners, talking and lingering too long, etc.) I'll still go to this sauce it's very convenient location wise for me, but they could use a revamp in management. Way too shmarmy for me and seems pretty arrogant.
