The cafe is eclectic, and the kitchen is completely open which is interesting. Now if you're not a huge fan of communal seating like benches and couches then head down the middle hallway to the areas with more desk seating. It's past the restrooms. There will be two open areas you can choose from and a patio.\n\nAlso, parking - there is parking off of central in the Pane Bianco lot if you follow that alley straight you'll hit a fork, turn left for the Lux parking lot, you can also get into it from W Turney Ave.\n\nHad the Velvet Latte which I was surprised to find had a lot of foam as well, like a cappuccino, yum! It was rich and creamy as well which was wonderful.\n\nOrdered the Nutella Banana Braid which I wasn't a huge fan of, not enough Nutella or sugar, it just felt like bread opposed to dessert. \n\nHowever, the Kouign Amann was amazing! It's a French pastry that tastes something in between a Creme Brulee and a Croissant. I highly recommend it!
