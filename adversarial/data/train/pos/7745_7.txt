Came back after months and the place was awful.\nWaitress made us get our own food, serve ourself, clean ourselves and couldn't even being the bill.\nPlace could be so much better if they didn't have the open concept kitchen.\n\nMeats all need sauce.\n\nWhen u don't have a item on the menu always best to let it be known before letting someone order it.\n\nBathrooms don't have running hot water \n\nPositive note beer was great ( 4 L) and lights are pretty
