Wow..This club is S-U-C-K Hahaha sorry for Libby. The problem with this place....it isn't the decor. It's not the location. It's kinda a cheesey pimp my ride place. Its hard for me to support this place because the bartenders were kinda douches to me. AND I KNOW PEOPLE WHO WORK HERE! Also they wanna run this place like they run it in NY. Problem is it's different here. I even interviewed for this place and I didn't like the vibe the people gave out. So this place also owes a lot of money. Not the best place to work from what I understand. I even waited to get in....wow. Drinks are expensive. But someone has to pay for the freaking gold and platinum floors. I figure the next time I come I'm gonna bring a pick axe and mine me some precious metals. Hey Times are Tough...\nYa this isn't a club. It's a high end sports bar. But it can be a little ghetto fabulous. I mean I'm not one to rip on Jay Z but ahem...this is my hood. Why didn't you ask me how to run this place? Dont forget the people who make Vegas go - it's not all tourist it's the locals too!
