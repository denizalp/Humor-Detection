My first time dinner experience here was very very good.  Thank you Jen K for making my trip here happened!  I can't wait to write a review about it.\n\nI like the restaurant decor.  It is trendy and comfortable.\n\nThe place was not very busy on a weekday at night.  The servers were friendly.  They came and cleaned up our plates all the time.  One of the male servers was particularly helpful providing us advice on choosing our food.\n\nWe ordered the daily special Seared Sushi Platter (Anago, Foie Gras, Scallop, Hamachi and Kama Toro) for $19.99.  The sushi was not just nicely presented but awesomely fresh and yummy.  The sushi chef certainly did a fantastic job on his sushi.  One particular thing that made me like the sushi here more is because the chef put a bit of wasabi between the rice and the slightly seared piece.  I have always been told that this is the most traditional Japanese way of making good quality and high-end sushi. \n\nWe tried a little bit everything.  The steamed egg with a big piece of lobster meat and a piece of fresh uni is also a very nice daily special.  We also have a grilled shrimp, and pork neck yakitori.  \n\nI was tempting to try the salmon skin chips but this was not a regular dish on menu.  The chef made us a complimentary tartar to try instead (with the honor of Jen K as a regular there).\n\nThe dinner began with salad and miso soup and ended with a coffee pudding and a complimentary black sesame ice cream.  So far so excellent.  A solid 4 star dinner.\n\nI will certainly come back for dinner again and try their lunch soon!
