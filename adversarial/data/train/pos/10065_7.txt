My 50th Yelp review is ...Vegas, baby !\nA city filled with gaudy glitz and copious amounts of debauchery that is ever changing and yet so old school ...what's not to love ?\n\nGrowing up, my aunts who were huge Frank Sinatra fans would fly from New York to Vegas to watch ol blue eyes croon .I would sit and watch them pack all their evening gowns, clutch bags, shoes,  and  their \"good jewelry \" , and listen attentively to all their chatting about what other shows they would see, where they would eat ,etc .\nMy Grandparents and Parents also visited Vegas annually, so,  it stands to reason that It left an impression on me that Vegas was \"the place\" to see a show . \nI loved hearing all the stories upon their return of all their celebrity elbow rubbing and viewing the photos they had taken with said celebrities .\n\nI am a very nostalgic person, and though i consider myself very current and modern in most ways, I also am very old school .I have seen many changes over the years come over \"sin city\"  new hotels residing in old classic 's now ( Bellagio now stands where the Dunes used to)  More casino's, and even more low brow activity hot spots that seem to have spread out  along the strip ( not enough to deter me from visiting)\n\nI have never been  much of a gambler so the draw to Vegas for me ,isn't in the Gaming ..it is in the shows, restaurants,  and yes the neon lights.\nIt's the night life, the sand buggy's,  and a few other cool places that are off the beaten path of the strip itself .\n\nThe Vegas baton was passed to me some time ago,  and now i am the one packing all my glitz for Vegas to go see a show or favorite performer(not as often as my family before me) now i am the one with stories.. so much so ...that my children have all been to Vegas for their Twenty-first  birthdays. so the tradition of Vegas continues within my family .\n\nSo there I am  dressed to the nines walking down the street and as i pass a bunch of over done transexual hookers ...i hear Natalie Merchant's Carnival in my head and i start to sing along ....\n\nI've walked these streets\nA virtual stage\nIt seemed to me\nMake up on their faces\nActors took their\nPlaces next to me \n\nI've walked these streets\nIn a carnival\nOf sights to see\nAll the cheap thrill seekers\nThe vendors & the dealers\nThey crowded around me \n\nAnd i throw my head back and laugh up at this neon Vegas sky ....\nas i said , what's not to love ?
