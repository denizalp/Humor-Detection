Paying It Forward... Yelp Style \n\nThe 2016 Yelp 100 Review Challenge:     8\/100 \n\nThis is a wonderful addition to the Las Vegas Yelp Community! Thank you Debby for creating this page and for her review in Yelp Compliments Atlanta. Congrats on making this happen. I read the reviews for that page, and WOW. I enjoyed reading them and seeing all the good that Yelpers do. \n\nI've been on yelp for a few years, but have only been active (writing reviews consistently & interacting w\/ the yelp community in the past couple months). I honestly had no clue what I was suppose to do with compliments or what the protocol was. Doh! So sorry..please accept my apologies. :-)\n\nNow that I'm more active, I'm understanding the value of compliments. You never know what someone is going through...they could be going through something that only they know about.\n\nWith all that's going on in the world, this a great, simple and free way to SHINE YOUR LIGHT. I don't know anyone that doesn't appreciate a little light in their life. \n\n Compliments are a great way to brighten someone's day, be friendly or flirty without being creepy. \n\nI enjoy receiving them but I'll pass on the weird-creepy-stalker-ish ones. Everyone enjoys compliments but guys please think about what you write if you send someone a compliment :) .... Yelp is not Tinder. It's a safe space to express our love of food, good times & connecting with other foodies. I believe you can be nice without creeping someone out. \n\nIt's nice to be appreciated for writing a great review or taking a dreamy photo. So I'll be sending out more compliments from now on. \n\nI'll be giving them away like Oprah... YOU get a compliment, YOU GET A COMPLIMENT and YOU GET A COMPLIMENT! EVERYONE GETS A COMPLIMENT!!!  \n\nIf I send you one... No I ain't tryna stalk you or flirt with you, (don't get it twisted) but it's just my Yelpy way of sharing random acts of kindness and the aloha spirit.
