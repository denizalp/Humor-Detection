I was looking for a place to watch a soccer game online at 8 in the morning, I found Tsaa. It makes me think of tsar everytime I see it.\n\nwith free wifi and decent looking drinks, they had my business.\n\nI didn't realize that it was a tea shop until I noticed the dozens of different tea's they offer, I know green, and black, and jasmine so she got us a pot of jasmine dragon (something like that) tea for $7.\n\nsort of steep for tea(HA! PUN!), but I understand it's a specialty or something which is much easier to justify than paying anything over a quarter for a bag of black tea at most places.\n\nA small grievance is also how the tapioca is an extra dollar, they have both bubble tea and smoothies on the menu, If I have to pay extra for tapioca then why are they seperate? bubble tea is basically a smoothie (or some variation) with tapioca in it.\n\nregardless, for $5 I got the mango bubble tea. It was made with fresh mango and tasted as a good drink should.\n\nmost of my admiration from this place goes to it's good location, good decor, and relative quietness when compared to most coffee shops, which I noticed at the time of my 8 am game were already filled with people doing whatever the hell they do on their laptops all day.\n\nAlso they didn't mind me and a buddy being loud soccer hooligans first thing in the morning in their cute little tea shop :)\n\nthe bathroom is a tiny little closet with a sliding door, I found this cool.
