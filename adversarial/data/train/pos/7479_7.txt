I went back again to the location on Camelback and my burger was raw AGAIN! For two burgers, one order of fries, and two soft drinks, a $50 bill is completely unreasonable. Especially for raw burgers. We also went to the location in Gilbert--this was better, but only for the reasonable prices of happy hour!
