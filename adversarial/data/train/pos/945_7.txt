I've never felt so compelled to write a review about the grocery store before! I'm somewhat new to this area and this Fry's Marketplace just opened and it is probably my favorite place right now. I mean it has a freaking wine bar and sushi bar inside. I've been cooking a ton lately and I found all types of interesting ingredients to work with. I've also found that they have smaller portions which is perfect for someone like me who just shops for one (womp womp!) Now I never have too much food and my food never goes bad like when you go to other stores and have to get like a 10 pound bag of kale! \n\nPros: \n-They have the greatest selection of produce, all kinds of things I've never heard of. \n\n-Their selection of meats, cheeses, and seafood cannot be beat. \n\n-They have individually portioned fish like ahi tuna, swordfish, and salmon. \n\n-The employees are always in such a good mood and so helpful.\n\n-Their antipasta bar is amazing, all different types of cheeses, olives, meats, and garlic\n\n-Starbucks\n\n-Their deli and hot food section is fast and offers great dinner options premade and ready to go\n\n-Their prices are insane, I've never saved so much money shopping at a grocery store before\n\nCons:\n-Everyone and their mom comes here right now since it's so new
