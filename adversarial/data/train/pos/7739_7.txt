Over the past 3 years we've bought a few pieces for our house here.  There's always a decent selection of furniture and home decor in the store.  I recommend stopping by every 6 months or so to see what they have.\n\nI recently stopped by to see if there was anything I could find for The Better Half for Christmas.....didn't find anything but saw a lot of interesting pieces.....there was a C3PO robot and 2 Pirates (see pics)....I'd love to get them for the house, but The Better Half would kill me.  They'd make great conversation pieces though...LOL\n\nThe sales people here can be a bit pushy, but all you have to do is tell them you're there browsing and they'll leave you alone.  The prices are somewhat negotiable.....they'll consider most offers unless the person selling on consignment has a high floor price....then there's not much room for negotiation.\n\nWill I return?  Like I said, I'm here every 6 months or so to see if I can find some cool stuff.
