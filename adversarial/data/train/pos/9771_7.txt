(One star because Yelp won't let me use zero stars).  @Dr. V's review pretty much sums it up, but here's my two bits:  \n\nThis place is gutter (as in being there make you feel like you are lying in a gutter).  It lures men in with the promise of a great time (illegal or otherwise), but in reality, the place is often completely empty with unattractive dancers.  Not a great time.  And the dancers put little to no effort into the dances.\n\nThe experience only worsens when you get a hard sell from the management (demanding a cover charge) and the dancers (demanding a steep tip for lap dances).  No liquor since it's all nude.  The place feels dirty as hell (in a catch an infection way, not an ironic or fun way).  \n\nBottom line: if you enjoy strip clubs, you won't enjoy this one.
