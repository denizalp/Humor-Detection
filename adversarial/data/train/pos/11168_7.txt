Went 9-6-15 around 2PM.  This place is crawling with hipsters! \n\n$4.54 got me an iced nutella latte...it's pretty darn great.  My favorite part is they have the real crunchy ice like Sonic.  \n\nFor the price I think I'd rather have Starbucks but you can't beat the ambiance of this place.  I feel like everyone in here is either studying for their surgical finals or writing the script for the next blockbuster movie.  Michelle Obama gets her coffee here (la-ti-daaaa).  \n\nIf you are afraid of birds I suggest you stay inside because the patio is filled with them, and they ain't shy!  I saw a few fly right onto tables that people were sitting at.
