Sandwiches may be what the Earl is known for, but I ordered a wrap instead -- I know. I'm such a rebel. \n\nFor around 7 bucks I got a Chicken Caesar Wrap that was packed tightly with lettuce, diced chicken, shaved parmesan cheese, and an excess of SALTY dressing. Want a wheat tortilla instead of the default white flour version? Too bad because they don't have that option. Their version of this wrap wasn't the best that I've had, and it actually irritated my stomach. \n\nAnticipate long lines, crowds of diners, and limited seating if you plan on eating here.  The ordering process goes like this: place your order at one end and move down to the other to pay. Along the way, you're tempted to increase your bill with sweets, chips, and bottled beverages. If possible, It might be a good idea to place an order to go and eat elsewhere.\n\nThis was my first and last trip to this place, which is another overpriced eatery on The Strip offering mediocre food.\n\nAnd that's a wrap.
