Stop two to make a comparison of the auto parts chains, here's Autozone. If there's a differentiator between this one and the other, I can't say. It was busy with a few people working on their cars in the parking lot.\n\nVery similar to the other with five or six aisles of goodies including a huge wall of oil filters and jugs of various oils. Cleaning chemicals, fluids, accessories and apparently everything you can replace on an automobile behind the counter.
