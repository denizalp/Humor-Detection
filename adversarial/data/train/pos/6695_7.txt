What a find! Despite the numerous times I've been to Vegas, it wasn't until my last trip that my friend and I stumbled upon this gem as we searched through Yelp for a place to grab lunch. \n\nBoy, it did not disappoint!\n\nI started off with the Violet Beauregarde Old Fashioned. It had Patron in it which intrigued me...and Tequila Lisa wanted to come out. It was very tasty, not too strong but you can definitely taste the tequila. \n\nThe biscuits are sooooo addicting. Still nice and warm when brought out to the table, soft and fluffy on the inside. Eat it with their honey butter...ooohwee!\n\nThe chicken and waffles is the dish to order, it's actually their most popular dish. Everything about it made me so happy. The chicken was crispy on the outside, juicy on the inside, and perfect with the honey hot sauce. Waffles were warm and fluffy, drizzled with the bourbon maple syrup that wasn't overly sweet either. I'm a waffles kinda gal.\n\nWe also ordered the mac n cheese and crispy brussel sprouts to accompany the chicken and waffles and both were really good as well. \n\nOur server was very accommodating and friendly. He checked on us frequently, and made a few trips back to the kitchen to ask about cinnamon being in any of the dishes for my friend who is allergic. \n\nRecommendation: chicken n waffles!
