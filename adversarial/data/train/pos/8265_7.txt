Whymsical. Eclectic. Modern. Even a bit Victorian. D. Frank packs a wallop of a punch for any shopping addict. Nestled along fantastic Stetson Dr. in Oldtown Scottsdale, this beautfiul two-room furniture and art boutique is the perfect holiday shopping stop. This award winning designer has such a flair for upscale style. Yet I find the store and it's wares to be very approachable. From the $1,200 Swarvoski crystal floor lamp (to die for...I would most definitely give a limb or organ for it) to a delicate butterfly tray priced at $22. There are sofas, dining room furniture, occasional chairs, day beds and lots of gorgeous art. Not to be missed are the candles, collectible boxes and stationery. Oldtown is decked out for the holidays and has never looked better. Especially along this stretch as most of the new buildings and waterfront action is up and aglow. Thank you D. Frank Designs. You have finally put me in the Christmas spirit!
