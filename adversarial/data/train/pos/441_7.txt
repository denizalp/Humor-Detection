A cozy Indian restaurant that serves several different types of curries and meats at a reasonable price. This place seems family owned and was featured on a Guy Fieri show, and they have a rather large display of him behind their cashier. \n\nI came with over 10 of my family members and we tried an assortment of dishes. The Chicken Tikka Masala was pretty average- it was a tad too spicy and I thought served an unsatisfying amount of chicken. The naan bread was also only OK, I preferred it with garlic but found some pieces slightly burned. I also tried a bit of the mixed tandoori grill and there was barely any flavor or seasoning, although the meat was tender. The best dish was a green curry lamb, which had good flavor.\n\nThis place is affordable and good for groups, but just standard in terms of Indian food.
