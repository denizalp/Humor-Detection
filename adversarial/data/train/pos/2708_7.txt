Tried not to look like a tourist and stare at the floor too much. I caught some quick glances while browsing. And what a browse! I only got through the B's before i had reached my spending limit. Really did not expect this quality of used vinyl for these low prices at a place so close to the \"so last issue\" Beachland. Case in point: Music Saves. But this place is the real deal.  \nLuckily my mom had just found a hidden treasure in my childhood home and broken me off a fifty this morning. I dropped twenty at Blue Arrow like it was nothing. And i'm glad. My Mind's Eye used to have a used section this good about five years ago, but they've scaled back some in favor of new vinyl. I'm much more of a used fan. And i have practically every slab of psych known to man(or at least burned to cd). But i found a couple i had missed along the way here. That's a  rare feat for any store. I put off coming here for way too long. \n\nThe floor is of course, an orgy of album art for the eyes. Village People gatefold opened up to reveal their sweet outfits dead center of the store. \nThe rest of the decor is pretty simple. Dudes at the counter were hip and nice. To quote the immortal Mitch Capka of WJCU, \"one hell of a rock n roll rocket ride\"!
