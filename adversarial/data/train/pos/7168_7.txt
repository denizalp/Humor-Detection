OK..from my pictures you'll very quickly notice it was my first time at dim sum. Note to self ordering two orders means a small sharing plate heaped with food not just two pieces like my boyfriend suggested...\n\nFrom our mountain of food I have to say the food was delicious! We got a bit of everything and some highlights were:\n-shrimp and chive dumplings, steamed and super light yet filling\n- bbq runs though they were on the oiler side\n- the chicken spring rolls not greasy at all\n- pork dumpling which I had only a bite of because I was majorly stuffed by the time they arrived.\n\nI wasn't a fan of the tea as its loose leaf Nd sone of the leaves seeped into my cup and settled...where the tea strainer at?\n\nThis is a no frills spot where they pack plates with food and though the server etiquette ight be slightly lacking, the food is amazing and cheap!\n\nOur bill was pretty whopping but we also ordered enough to feed the army of a small country. I'd suggest calling ahead for a reservation, and note they do accept credit and debit.
