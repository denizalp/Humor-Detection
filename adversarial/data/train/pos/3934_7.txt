I'm a little ashamed to admit that I've lived in Madison for five years and had NEVER been to the Essen Haus until this week. I feel like I've been living a lie.\n\nFirst thing's' first: lederhosen. All of the male bartenders and servers wear them and it makes everything good in the world. So much man leg.\n\nBEER. Huge steins full (half a liter) for $4.50. You can go and get pretty sloshed for under $10. If that's not economizing, I'm not sure what is.\n\nLive polka music. Nothing puts me in the mood to party like a little accordion action. \n\nSurvery says: Essen Haus is probably not the place I'd go every week, but the next time I need some old time-y German fun, I'll totally be back.
