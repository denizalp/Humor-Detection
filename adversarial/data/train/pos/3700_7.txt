Great service. I told them that a friend recommend I try it out and they knew who it was and were excited that she had recommended it! It was clean and they sat me in a chair immediately. I like that they told me who would be helping me and that it would just be a few minutes while he cleaned up after the last customer. I wasn't sure about my polish choice and she gave me just the right help that I needed. I was the last one in the shop that night but they didn't rush to get me out of there! I just made a second appointment!
