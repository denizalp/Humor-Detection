I do love burgers.  What I don't love is astoundingly bad service and a thirty dollar burger that tastes like five.  I'll spare you the gory details, but the service at the bar was so bad that almost every diner around me was slinging insults at the one bartender who was (sort of) trying to take care of thirty people at lunchtime.  She seemed to have given up on the job without actually quitting.\n\nI couldn't believe the horde of poor bastards who were waiting in line outside of this abomination as I left.  I felt like shouting at all of them to STAY THE HELL AWAY!!! RUN!!!\n\nAnd then I remembered I use Yelp.  Take that, you sorry asshats.  Your restaurant sucks.
