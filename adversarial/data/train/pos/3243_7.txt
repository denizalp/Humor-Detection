This was an awful fucking experience. I came here from the Rainbow Gathering in Wyoming at the insistence of my boyfriend who had been to Vegas once before. \n\nOur room was definitely nicer than we expected for only $79, with a comfy bed, large bathtub and a chaise lounge. However, the television remote barely worked from the bed unless you angled it just right, and a few hours after we arrived, the cleaning staff attempted to walk in! Luckily, I had bolted the door.\n\nThe pool was a joke. It was 4 feet at it's deepest point, the \"hot tub\" was more like a lukewarm tub, and it all closed down early in the evening. So, why are there lights in the pool?\n\nI was treated rudely by almost everyone I encountered, and was yelled at twice for not wearing shoes, once because I was eating in their overpriced buffet with my feet tucked under me on the chair and my shoes on the floor below. The only time I was treated well was if I was gambling or drinking.\n\nOh, and did I mention that the entire building is just a confusing mess, with a lack of adequate signage? If you want to lose your soul and all of your money, head to Vegas. Otherwise, stay home and do headstands. You'll have a better time.
