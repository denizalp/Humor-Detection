\"Lucky 12\" ($20.88): Pork & Shrimp Siu Mai, Bay Scallop & Pork Siu Mai, Chicken Siu Mai, and Lamb Siu Mai. Everything was tasty with the Pork\/Shrimp and Scallop\/Pork being my favorites. The gold foil on the Pork and Shrimp Siu Mai was a nice touch. They're decent dumplings, but certainly not the best ones I've had. I probably wouldn't order these again because the noodle dishes certainly stand out more.\n\nCrispy Bao Bun ($9.88): Slow-cooked Pork Belly, pickled vegetables, peanuts, and cilantro. The bao was nice, but I didn't care for the filling. Nothing stood out about the ingredients.\n\nLo Mein ($14.88): Hand-pulled wheat noodles, ham, forest mushrooms, carrot, Napa cabbage, scallion, soy sauce, and cilantro. The noodles were fantastically chewy and it was an overall flavorful dish.\n\nDan Dan Mian ($14.88): Hand-cut noodles, spicy pork sauce, cucumber, carrot, watermelon radish, cilantro, and Chinkiang vinegar. I really enjoyed his dish. I loved the spicy pork sauce reminiscent of Jajangmyeon (black bean noodles) and all the vegetables.\n\nCrispy Ocean Noodle ($24.88): Egg noodles, head-on prawns, snow peas, Shiitake mushroom, and Chinese gravy. This was my favorite dish of the bunch. I love crispy noodle dishes and this was delicious. Also, the prawns were wonderful.\n\nTaiwanese Shaved Ice (Large; $8.88): Coconut snow, condensed milk, fresh strawberries, toasted coconut, and mochi. I highly recommend the shaved ice (or shaved snow). This is probably the best Taiwanese Shaved Ice I've had. Really light, airy, and equally creamy. Wonderful flavor and I loved the toppings! It was also nice to eat out of a large bowl, so the shaved ice was nicely contained.\n\nOverall, I think the food is really nice. Though the prices are a bit high for dishes that I didn't absolutely love; which is why I find it difficult to return frequently. Especially with the increase of hand-pulled noodle places in town. Otherwise, I love the fun atmosphere and we had a very pleasant experience during our visit.
