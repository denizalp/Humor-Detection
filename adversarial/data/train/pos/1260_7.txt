The Good, the Bad and the Ugly. The price was right since we purchased a Groupon for an A\/C duct cleaning. The process was very quick and both workers were more than polite and appeared to know what they were doing. HOWEVER....I have had my A\/C ducts cleaned before and these guys did not do the same quality of work but the other company was a lot more expensive...so I guess you get what you pay for. \n\nThe Ugly of the process was there hard upsell for an upgrade in the A\/C air handler cleaning, which initially was quoted being around $500. They took a polite \"no thanks\" but the hard sell just kept coming. I understand they are not aware of my knowledge of HVAC systems but don't assume I know nothing because I can smell a sales pitch a mile away and I DO know about HVAC systems because I did have to work my way through college. So...the final word quick, easy and polite but expect a very hard upsell for extra services which they say you absolutely HAVE to have.
