I've been a member at this gym for at least a couple years now. My husband and I both go regularly and have been very happy with it - quite frankly it's an awesome value. We pay a total of $40\/month for the two of us. That's really hard to beat, especially because lots of local gyms are easily $100+ per person per month. \n\nThe gym is always clean (and the cleaning staff happens to be a bunch of sweet people) and the front desk staff has always been friendly to me. To those people who care about the weight and size of the folks at the front desk - get a grip - working at a gym is their job... doesn't always mean fitness is their passion... I'm sure you can relate to that in your own jobs.\n\nThey recently added more equipment, which is great, but it did lead to the floor being a bit more crowded - also means there is almost never a wait for machines. Give and take. \n\nAll in all, we recommend it!
