Bollywood Bites is both so wonderful, and so ghastly messed up that it's hard to write a proper review that reflects how wildly it swings to both sides of the spectrum.\n\nI happened to be driving right past the location today so I stopped in to pick up some chaat, just a quick little snack. It is indeed nearly impossible to find the restaurant. Just when you're about to give up, drive 100 feet farther and it's on your left.\n\nThe woman in the front was nice and smiled a lot, but understood very little I asked, so I just went with an order of Samosas and an order of Aloo Tiki. She told me, \"No credit card.\" I said fine, that I'd brought cash.  She said she would go drop off my order in the kitchen and come ring me up.   I stood at the counter for five minutes before I decided to sit in one of the plastic chairs. I realized she wasn't coming back for awhile.\n\nShe brought out my food about ten minutes later and told me it would be $7. I handed her a $20. She went in the back, then came back and asked me if I didn't have $7 exactly. I said I didn't, and asked if she'd take a check or something. (Lots of miming with my checkbook here.) She shook her head and made a phone call. I spent another 5-10 minutes waiting while she was in the back with my $20 trying to figure out what to do with it.\n\nFinally she came back to the front and went over to the cash register, that had been ignored throughout this whole time. While still on the phone she tentatively pressed a button twice and *woosh!* the cash register drawer flew open and her eyes lit up. Yes, she had to make a phone call to figure out how to get change for a $20.\n\nI left, amused at how screwy this place was and expecting never to return. Then I got home, and I tried the food. \n\nHere's the deal, the Aloo Tikki was the most flavorful Aloo Tikki I've ever had in my life. The Samosas were incredible. It is quite clear that there is a master in the kitchen at Bollywood Bites.\n\nBut it is equally clear that the management of this little hole-in-the-wall restaurant is horribly inept. Both from the reviews here, and from my own personal experience trying to simply order $7 worth of food from them. \n\nWhoever is running the show has made a series of bad decisions and wrong turns. The location is terrible. The lack of tables is ridiculous. Leaving a woman to manage the orders who can't communicate and doesn't know how to open a cash register is laughable.\n\nI don't know whether to love Bollywood Bites or hate it. I am absolutely sure I will be back to try more of the delicious food, but I won't get too attached to the restaurant. It just doesn't feel like a place that's going to be there more than a couple of years at the rate it's being managed.
