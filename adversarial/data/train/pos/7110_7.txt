What I love most about Lee's is that they are open at 8am! \nI know it's too early for Vietnamese sandwiches at breakfast, so I drive by in the morning, and stash the sandwiches for lunch. \n\nI customize my sandwich, and order a grilled chicken, add grilled pork with extra vegetables. It's the perfect combination of meat, vege and bread. The normal version is too bready for me. \n\nThe sandwiches are better fresh, as the French bread is soft with a fresh baked crust out of the oven. The longer you let the sandwich\/bread sit, the harder it gets. I suggest eating immediately if you can.\n\nThere's a buy 5 get the 6th complimentary offer. My office appreciates this offer :) Sandwiches for everyone!
