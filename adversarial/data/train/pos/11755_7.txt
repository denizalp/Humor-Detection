I don't know what I was thinking BJ's was, but not what it is. I thought it was a run-of-the-mill steakhouse, and it's more of a run-of-the-mill brewery. Does this make a difference, you might ask - and yes it does. \n\nSo, as this will not become a stable of mine, my visit did make me want to come back in the right mindset and the right company. Plowing through brews and sliders - yeah, I can see that happen.\n\nOK, so the service is standard, and the food seems very basic and the brews are a bit interesting.. but I did notice that besides having quite a few Pale Ale's and IPA's, every other ale is pronounced to be 'hoppy'. What if I don't want a hoppy beer, nor want the token lager that is the stand-in for the go-to Bud\/Miller\/Corrs\/30for$20 kinds of beer. I guess my options are limited, but I will need to plow through them all before I conclude that BJ's might oversell their product just a bit.\n\nI started with the Jeremiah Red, and wasn't blown away. I'd ask more of a Red Ale, and this was way middle of the road. Also very hoppy, even if it suggests being 'Not too hoppy in order to emphasize the complex malt flavor and fruity aroma'. I do not concur - I think its was too hoppy for a Red Ale. I will have to go hard next time to evaluate their brews. I have a feeling that I will not be all too impressed - but then again I will try to remain unbiased. \n\nSo where does this leave me? Nah, it's all right I guess.. and I will come back when the time is right.
