OK, so, before I say anything else: I love Pita Jungle. Best hummus ever. The glazed chicken lavosh pizza is one of my favorite dishes in town. The Fruit & Cheese FANTASIA deserves its capital letters. Basically, when it comes to the food, Pita Jungle is takin' care o' business.\n\nSo, with that in mind: What the hell were they thinking with the name?  I'm still running into people who have lived in the Valley for 6-7 years and never eaten there, though they declare themselves fans of mediterranean or vegetarian cuisine. Their stated reason: \"Sounded like a fast food place\" or \"I was afraid of some Eurasian Rainforest Cafe  knock-off.\" (OK, that last one is mine from when I first moved here.) It's name might actually be worse than Pita Pit's - and Pita Pit basically IS a fast food place.\n\nI also have a minor problem with the entire staff looking like half-starved refugees from Planet Hip, but that might be just be envy at the fact that I will never be that cool. It's like an indie record store that serves food.\n\nGo eat the food. Make fun of the name.
