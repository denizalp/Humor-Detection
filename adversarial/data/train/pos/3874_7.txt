Was looking forward to trying this place after reading the good reviews and about it being home made ice cream! Not impressed at Ã nd not affordable for a family! 2 waffle cones with 2 scoops of ice cream just sitting on top of each cone was $12.00!! Ice cream a just ok, nothing scooptacular about it!! Sorry! Also girl behind the counter had NO personality!
