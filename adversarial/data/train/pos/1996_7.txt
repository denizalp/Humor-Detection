So...where do we begin?  \n\nI've been here twice.  \n\n5 stars for food (both visits).  Everything I've had (miyagi burger, omelettes, 36 hr loco moco, juices, salty caramel latte...) has been PERFECTLY DELICIOUS!\n\n5 stars for aesthetics...beautiful space. Very unexpected for a strip mall!  \n\nThe majority of the staff was great on both visits.  Our servers were very attentive, kept our glasses full, and give us good recommendations.  And to the kitchen staff who prepped our yummy meals, kudos to you.  Our food all came out in a very timely manner and tasted as good as it looked.  Thanks!!\n\nSo, WHY?? You may be asking......WHY only 2 stars? \n\nand truly, 2 stars is what they deserve...because 2 stars means \"meh. i've EXPERIENCED BETTER'\n\nWell, the manager. Or whoever that girl is who doesn't wear the tan polo shirt.  I think she's the manager...\n\nHere we go...\n\nOn our fist visit, when we were almost done with our meal, she came over to stand behind our server was dropping off our to-go drinks and the server asked us \"how was everything?\" and I asked, \"do you take reservations?\"\n\nThe server said, \"No, sorry\"\n\nThe manager cut in and said, \"Yes, we do.\"\n\n*ookay??*\n\nThe manager goes on to say, \"We do...it depends on how many...will everyone be here?  we can't seat until everyone is here...we can't take the reservation beforehand...we don't really take reservations...call the day of...we'll see how busy we are...we've had people call and not show up...blah blah blah blah...if we have to move tables you have to be here\"....(oh, and side note, on the first visit...I was there at noon and there were 3 tables seated the entire time i was there).\n\nAs you can imagine, my mind was spinning, her answer was unclear, uninformative, and all over the place...all I needed was a yes or no, which was impossible to achieve...so I smiled, nodded, and left.\n\nSo, because of the great food, I wanted to share Bachi HLK with some out of town family who came into town the following weekend.  Clearly, I didn't bother calling for a reservation...we just drove up and walked in.  I arrived with 4 other adults and a baby.  \n\n(oh, by the way, there were 2 tables seated at this time...nobody waiting)\n\nWe walked in, were greeted by a nice man who asked us, \"how many?\"  \nwe said, \"5 adults and a baby\" \nhe said, \"do you need a highchair\"\nwe said, \"yes\"....\nhe said, \"is everyone here?\"  \nwe (4 of us) said, \"yes, the one person missing is right there in the car parked outside changing the 1 year old who slept all the way here...she'll be right in...\"  \n\n**we all turn to look out the window and see our cousin in the car.**\n\nThe nice man grabs menus and another server to help scoot 2 tables together...and low and behold, the red headed manager beelines from the kitchen up to the front and asks us \"is everyone here?\"  \n\n*pause*  now, i'm not a jerk, i'm usually very polite, very kind, i'm not rude nor am I high maintenance, but I don't appreciate having an entire conversation with one employee, then being questioned about the same topic immediately by another.  if the manager put the guy at the door to greet customers, then trust that guy to be doing the right thing.  trust that he's had the \"is everyone here\" conversation with me already.  Or, manager girl, if you feel the need to micromanage, please don't drag me (the customer) into it.  ask your guy if my party is here.  why would your staff be moving tables and setting up our party if we didn't meet their seating criteria.  and WHY should customers be bombarded by DIFFERENT employees about the same question??  oh, and greet me.  don't walk up to me and ask me a question...I DON'T WORK HERE.  greet me.  a hello, how are you...those would be appropriate things to say to me.  NOT asking me a question i've ALREADY ANSWERED!\n\nugh, anyways, i ignored her.  i'm not a record player, so get the story from your staff (whom i've already spoken to).\n\nwe sat down, the adult in the car came in with the baby and we ordered.  (Still, at this time, there are only 3 tables seated including us). \n\nour food came, it was yummy,our server came to check on us periodically...just enough.  The funniest and MOST ANNOYING thing though...when she came to check on us after our food came out, the moment she turns on her heel...the manager is 3\" behind her asking the EXACT same question.    \n\nDUDE, MANAGER GIRL, do you not see us stuffing our faces?  we just stopped to say \"Great\" to our server and now you're asking us the same question 1 second after she asked us.  You're so on her tail she almost smacked into you when she turned away from us.  \n\ni mean seriously...MANAGER GIRL...you seem to be the most difficult person i have EVERY dealt with in a restaurant setting.  Seriously.  stop it.  \n\nWe have a lot of choices when it comes to food...GOOD FOOD, so please...treat customers well.  Don't be overbearing, and trust your staff.  And provide good customer service.  make your customers feel welcome.  You make it hard to eat here.
