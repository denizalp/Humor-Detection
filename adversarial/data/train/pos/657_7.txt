When you've lived in a city where incredible food from any ethnicity is pretty much at your doorstep, moving to Phoenix can be a little disheartening at times. \n\nBack then, it was, \"I feel like Ethiopian food.\" \n\nFriend: \"Or do you want Eritrean food?\"\n\nMe: \"Same thing.\"\n\nFriend: \"Say that to an Ethiopian or an Eritrean and they'll smack you upside the head.\"\n\nMe: \"Ok, I feel like Ethiopian AND\/OR Eritrean food.\"\n\nFriend: \"Ok, there's like 20 places to go to, so let's narrow it down , shall we?\"\n\nFast forward to me being in Phoenix.\n\nFriend: \"Hey! Let's have Ethiopian food!\"\n\nMe: \"Kickass! What's around here?\"\n\nFriend: \"Well, there's Cafe Lalibela. And that's, uh, it.\"\n\nMe: \"Errrr....\"\n\nSo we headed to Tempe, braving rush hour traffic, and found Lalibela pretty easily. Inside you've got the cute Ethiopian girls with big incredible eyes waiting at your tables. No harm there. \n\nThe menu: Not as many dishes as I've seen at Ethiopian places back home, but they have all the classics. We ordered the kye sega wat (cubed beef simmered in spices), misir wat (red split lentils), and the tikil gomen (spiced carrots, cabbage, and potatoes). And of course, you gotta have the honey wine to wash it down with. \n\nAround 10 minutes later our platter came before us - all three dishes piled on top of a flat sheet of spongy injera bread. Just the aroma wafting into your nose is enough. Take a deep breath. Mmmm....\n\nAnd verdict? All the dishes were really good - the beef being most excellent. We took our time, and got extra injera, sopping up whatever was on the plate. \n\nA great meal had, I'd say Lalibela is mellow and unassuming, but being so small I can see it could get pretty busy on weekend nights. It's got plenty of tasty vegetarian dishes so those of you who don't do the animal won't be all depressed like you would walking into a Black Angus.  Dishes range from very mild to dishes with a little kick, but I grew up eating raw green chilis, so maybe I'm not the best judge here.  \n\nAll in all, this place is a definite plus for east African food here in the Valley of the Sun.\n\nWORD TO THE WISE: Ethiopian\/Eritrean food is NOT lactose intolerant-friendly. You won't know it when you eat it., because you're too busy stuffing your face because it's so damn good and plentiful and there's the wine and the cute waitress and.... \n\nBut everything's cooked in butter. A LOT of butter. So much so that two Lactaid pills offer little resistance. So pick a night you're feeling somewhat masochistic and go. Enjoy yourself. Eat boutiful amounts of dishes ending in \"wat.\" And then tell all your friends you'll meet them at the bars later, after you make a quick \"detour\" home.
