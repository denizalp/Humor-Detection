Restaurant.com certificate brought me here, and brought me a bill $25 less than it would other wise have been!\nThat's a \"Yea!\"\n\nThe food was all prety good.  We got the Meat Lovers Platter, which for $18 per person (regular price) gave you what the menu described as \"A Symposium of Ecstacy\"\n\nUh, say what?!?.  Even if we give the benefit of the doubt and use the ancient Greek definition -- a drinking party with intellectual conversation -- it's hardly a fitting use of the word 'symposium'.  \n\nIt was more a smorgasbord, or a cornucopia...\nheck, let's just call it a Smorgas-copia of Meat.\n\nAnd to blashpeme the word Ecstacy with such a lame use of the concept!   (although, \"try my meat\" and just maybe...)\n\nThere was a huge pile of thick gyro shavings, two lamb chops, one each of beef-chicken-pork kabob skewers, two piles of rice, a bevy of lemony roasted potatoes, a mound of moussaka, a dish of tzaziki, and several stacks of pita wedges.\n\nVolume and quality of the meat was just fine, with the kabobs really outshining everything else, especially the lamb chops, which were actually my least favorite meat item (fatty and almost flavorless, what flavor was there had me wishing they WERE flavorless).\n\nThe sides were beyond underwhelming.  The potatoes were over lemon-ed and under anything-else, as far as spice\/taste.  The rice was very Minute Rice in consistency, you know, not a grain sticking to another grain; it was annoying, though, with a feel more like orzo than rice.   Tzaziki was really great, but the pita was more like the flat bread they make Gorditas and Chalupas out of than actual pita bread.\n\nService was friendly when present, but minimally requisite.  I did not feel any inclination to tip over and above the 18% required by the Restaurant.com certificate.\n\nThe patio-like area enclosed with glass walls makes for a nice view during the day I'm sure (but of what? the stadium parking lot?) but it also made for a horrendous echo that eventually got quite annoying.\n\nThe deal with the certificate was good enough that I'll do it again, but I'm seeing if they offer another location.\n\nPS: it wasn't me that did it, but don't tell a 13 year old girl about lamb
