Please, don't think you'll be the exception to the reviews you'll read on this page, I made that mistake.\n\nI've been here twice and both times were not good; the last time was on Friday and let me state that I contacted Full Circle Auto Wash directly to give them an opportunity to respond before I came to Yelp and they have ignored my correspondence.  Honestly, I am left to think that they simply don't care.\n\nI am not a perfectionist but I do expect a fair service when I am paying $16 for a car wash.  I was in an out in about 15 minutes if that gives you any indication of how detailed the workers were.\n\nThere were FIVE dried up smelly squares sitting on the back seat that had no fragrance; the mirrors were all out of whack; seats were pulled up as close as they could go; they didn't touch the dashboard; there was still hair on the carpets; before I got in the car I had to ask that they wipe down several spots on the outside including the white paint on the window; and my FOB doesn't beep now.\n\nCome on, if you have to move the seats, I get that but move them back at least a little so I can get in.  There is no attention to detail, the inside of the windows look like a two year old was playing inside and we don't have small children.  What should have been a simple clean, as it was not dirty turned out looking worse.\n\nThe whole experience was a fail and to make matters worse, nobody had the business sense to contact me when I first voiced my complaint.\n\nDirty birdies and I will NOT be back!
