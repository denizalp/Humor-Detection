If you are from San Francisco bay area you should be no stranger to Bouchon. It is yet another creation from the legendary restaurateur Thomas Keller's. Not to be confused with Bouchon bakery (which could be found nearby), the Bouchon bistro is a sit down restaurant featuring casual (but upscale) French fare with Californian twist. Bouchon is not the poor man version of French Laundry or Per Se. It is a whole new different concept. If you are expecting classic fine dining there are plenty of excellent choices on the strip. \n\nSeafood are flown daily from the bay area. For those of you that are not from the beautiful San Francisco, this is a great place to sample some of the best freshness this city have to offer. The seafood plateau looks absolutely amazing but even the petit version could be quite a challenge to finish. \n\nEntrees were all likable. Our server recommended Blanquette de Lotte (roasted monkfish) saying it is one of their most popular dishes. Strangely, I found the monkfish texture a little dry and the sauce rather ordinary. Gigot d'Agneau (roasted leg of lamb) was very tender and flavorful. It is difficult not to enjoy a lamb dish that is cooked to the perfect temperature. The highlight of the night was actually the Poulet RÃ´ti (roasted chicken). The meat, even the usually drier breast pieces, was moist and tender. The skin was perfectly crispy. \n\nIt was a shame I was too full to try their dessert. \n\nFood was very good overall but nothing out of the world spectacular. Some might even consider the food pretty pricey for what you get but hey, this is Vegas.
