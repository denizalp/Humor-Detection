I ordered the Oven Roasted Foie Gras. This place is a complete rip off. For $29, I received a tiny piece of meat the size of a thumb! The meat wasn't even good. I initially thought that I had only received bread, as I couldn't see the meat (it was that small). If you're looking for a real dinner, look elsewhere. The portions are ridiculously tiny and expensive.It's actually pretty insulting! I wish I could give this place ZERO stars.
