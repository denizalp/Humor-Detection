Excellent hotel. Booking was easy. Price was fair. Check in was simple. Room is gorgeous. It has very comfortable beds and a large sitting room. The bathroom is large and comfortable and they have great amenities. Staff are very nice. The best pleasant surprise I had is how quiet the rooms are. I've stayed at most of the hotels on the strip over the years and usually you can hear everything and everyone in the hallways. I did not hear a sound from the outside while I was in my room. The casino is meh, but it is connected to The Venetian that has a great casino.
