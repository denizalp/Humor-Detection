First off, yay for centralized library systems!  I've lived in cities with a lone city library and others with a library system, and it simply doesn't make sense to me to have a separate system for each city\/building.  So, as to limited selection...why aren't you using library loan?  If you have internet access (available at the library) just find what you want in the catalog, place a hold on it and pick it up next time you visit.  It does require some forethought, but I feel the access to such selection is well worth that little extra effort.\n\nI favor this library solely because of its location: we shop at Costco so it's super convenient to swing by on our weekend errands.  I've always found it to be clean and never overcrowded.  Staff has regularly been friendly and helpful.  As for complaints about \"homeless people\"...I have words for you, but, more than anything, if you don't want to deal with the public, don't visit public spaces.
