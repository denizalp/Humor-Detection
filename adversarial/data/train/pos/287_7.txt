RIP OFF!  Called and was quoted approx $100  for oil change, air filter and cabin air filter. Upon arrival, was presented with estimate of $84.95 for a 15K service that said it included all 3 things listed above in addition to some other things. I signed the estimate.  Upon completion of work, I was presented with a bill for $180.  According to them, parts were additional. At my request, the cashier kindly adjusted the bill to the original estimate and I paid and left. A half hour later, the owner called me on the phone and said that I was mistaken and when I objected to this he told me that I am not welcome again in his shop.
