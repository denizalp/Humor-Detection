I generally like all other Fox concept restaurants and was looking forward to coming here. Came here for one night for late dinner on weekend and it was just okay for me.\n\nStarted with fresh guacamole and after a few bites, it was nothing to write home about. I don't think I would order again.\n\nFrom dinner menu, I ordered seared ahi tuna poke. Tuna was flavored good but everything else was underwhelming. \n\nService was good, she was friendly.
