I really don't like this place.\n\nAny place that wastes manpower on a hostess that you have to wait for in order to get permission to sit in an authorized place better have competent waiters to back that up. Otherwise, you're just creating another choke point in the flow of mediocrity. Which is the case every time I visit here\n\nI like the beer selection, but the food and service is soooo meeediooocccreeee. The pastas, burgers, nachos. Bland. And not justified by the price. $20 for nachos without meat or guac? If you're not convinced, just look at the menu critically. This place touts the \"fresh, original, delicious\" schtick, but it just comes off pretentiously. And not just because the food sucks. You can get \"Northern California Poutine\" (just like how SFO yuppies love it at their local poutinery in SOMA!) or \"Baked Lobster Bree\" (caught daily from the Bow). It's phony. It sucks.\n\nThe last time we went, the waitress was more inattentive than the inattentiveness we are used to at 1600. This is because her zone seemed to be the whole patio and a little section inside. We had to flag down the hostess to get us more drinks or extra salsa with our medicore nachos (credit to them, sadly, but they used fresh jalapenos on the nachos. Yep, that's right, they spent $0.10\/jalapeno and cut it up. Sadly, that is praiseworthy). But when they brought the salsa out (not after reminding her) the nachos were extra medicore because they were cold. But they were sure to ring it in and charge us $2 for the salsa. I'd bitch and moan about this, but, the waitress was never around.\n\nWhen we eventually got the bill, we saw they overcharged us for a bunch of beers that were on special. And the salsa we never consumed because it took 20 minutes.\n\nHonestly, why can't bars just convert to the UK model: put everyone behind the bar. When you want a drink or food, walk up and get it yourself. It would benefit everyone. Really. It would. You think one place in a city of one million could think \"outside\" the box.\n\nI'm going to use my final groupon on this place and I will never again eat or drink out at a tavern in calgary ever again. Seriously. I mean it. 'cept Moose McGuires.
