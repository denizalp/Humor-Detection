Love the service (if you're lucky, schmooze with the tea-tender, he's great!), love the local tea, and LOVE the location. Nothing but good things to say about this place. Have been back twice now, and my experience has always been excellent here. They now have food too, which is all local and delicious. They have a well-curated collection of teas, which is always wonderful and offers enough options that you won't get either bored or overwhelmed when you come in. Get over there!
