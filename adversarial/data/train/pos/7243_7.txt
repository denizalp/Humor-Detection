Some time around the end of 2007, there was an article in the National Post about a fancy new convenience store that would be hitting the streets of CityPlace soon. It talked of stylish decor and organic produce. I'm not sure if that is the same store that wound up moving in, because the store that's there now doesn't seem like much more than a normal convenience store with nice shelves.\n\nThere's certainly a lot of stuff crammed into those shelves - all manner of daily consumable necessities, from snacks to actual food. The biggest thing is their prices tend to be slightly to considerably more expensive than the Rabba located not five minutes away - a store that I don't consider to be the best deal around as it is. You'd also think that if they're going to charge that much for a bottle of pop, it would be kept cold, but still the 2L bottles sir, unrefrigerated and exposed for all to see.\n\nA recent addition is delivery service - for an extra $3 or so your order can be delivered to your door, provided you live in one of the CityPlace towers they serve. I can see this being useful for anyone who can't leave the house because of illness or injury or what not, but for anyone else, it seems a tad decadent - paying for delivery service from an already pricey store.\n\nWho knows, maybe my delicate suburban sensibilities simply can't handle what might very well be normal food prices for you city-dwellin' types (shouldn't such a large market mean that product can be delivered much cheaper?), but at any rate I find this store to be pricey and not overly noteworthy apart from its incredibly convenient location for the many people who live in the area. Until the big grocery store across Spadina opens, this is the only game in town - at least, for those who can't walk a block and a half north.
