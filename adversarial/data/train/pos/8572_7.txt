This hospital has got to be the worst. How do I know? I was a patient there for 2 weeks. Fucking RUDE ass nurses in the emerge and on the actual floors. You would think that one would leave the hospital feeling better.. WRONG. I was still just as sick when I was discharged, seriously, if you want good treatment and good well educated nurses, go to Toronto Western Hospital where you will actually get good treatment. The nurse in emerge was grabbing my legs hard and ripped off the sticker things from my body not being gentle at all. Things only got worse when I got my room. A nurse actually kicked my boots. They gave me medication that I was not entitled to and it caused a reaction so two nurses were called up from the ICU and all they could ask was \"are you bleeding\". What a terrible hospital, two weeks wasted there. Every time I drive past this place all I can think in my head is \"look at that fucking shit hole\".
