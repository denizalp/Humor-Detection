THE HOLLANDAISE WAS SOUR!!\n\nTHE COFFEE WAS WEAK!!\n\nTHE POTATOES WERE COLD!!!!!!\n\nHELL TO THE NO!!\n\nI was so disappointed to discover my former favorite breakfast spot had deteriorated so alarmingly in the past 3 years. It was a truly horrific experience, save the fresh squeezed grapefruit juice. \n\nDon't even bother.
