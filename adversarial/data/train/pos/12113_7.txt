Their iced coffee is to die for! It's smooth, medium-bodied, and has a hint of a french vanilla flavor. This location is by far my favorite because the baristas are so incredibly nice. I'd also recommend grabbing your own bag of their French Vanilla coffee to take and make cold brew at home...it comes out very similar! \n\nTheir pastries are delicious. The croissant + the iced coffee is one of the best combinations. Trust me: take a bite of the croissant and wash it down with the coffee. \n\nTheir flowers are gorgeous and never fail to impress the recipient. I love creating my own bundle but their bouquets are nice as well. I highly recommend heading here if you're looking to impress a girl - whether that be your mother, girlfriend, or another deserving lady.\n\nI don't come here to shop for groceries due to their higher price tag, but on holidays my family comes here to treat themselves to their fine seafood\/meat selections. They often have great vegetarian pre-made items as well.
