I am not sure if the old guy who works the dining room is a plus or minus. Like, is he creepy or endearing? He is constantly hitting on me but very insulting to Jillian N when we stop in on our lunch breaks. \n\nSometimes he will bring me free chips, but normally he just makes a lot of jokes about our male coworkers being very \"lucky.\" \n\nHe also likes to tell us that I am Awesome, and Jill is \"just okay.\" If it isn't enough to tell someone \"you are just okay\" he likes to repeat it to her many times. \"Amy, you are great. Just Great. Jill, you are ok. You know, just okay.\" \n\nOne of these days Jillian N is going to throw her guac in his face.
