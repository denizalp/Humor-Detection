I visited UN for a regular mani-pedi on a very busy Sunday afternoon. Judging by the reviews, I wanted to see whether it truly was comparable to Nailsense. \n\nUnfortunately, I was sorely disappointed. \n\nWhile the set-up is extremely cute and girly. It felt like it was in disarray. Gossip magazines strewn everywhere, flip flops tossed around, etc. \n\nI opted for Essie's Ballet Slippers on my fingers and OPI's 'You're Such a Kabuki Queen' on my toes. Now I'm not sure if Essie's quality is not up to par, or that the formulation was just too sheer -requiring 4 coats, or that the manicurist was just not skilled but my manicure barely lasted 24 hours of lunching, lounging, and basic office work; research and writing. \n\nIt was a typical $35+ tip and tax, but if you pay cash they waive the tax. Legit?\n\nThe pedicure lasted much longer but I doubt I'll be coming back.
