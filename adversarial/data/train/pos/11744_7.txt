Awesome little Chinese restaurant.  Came here to celebrate my sisters birthday.  \n\nThe restaurant was small, clean and decently kept for a fast food joint.  The loo was pretty decent too.  I wouldn't mind doing a two here.  \n\nThe food was definitely one of the best compared to other Chinese American restaurants.  Very tasty and full of flavour.  They have excellent egg rolls, great Mongolian Beef.  Awesome Beef Chow Fun, with a great fire wok flavour.  They have okay chicken cream corn soup.  We also have their special secret items too like the stir fried green beans and their juicy BBQ pork ribs!  Be sure to ask about it, it's legendary.  But they might not sell it.  \n\nThe workers were definitely super attentive, friendly, and professional.  Excellent job to the guy with the silver hair and the little girl with the gold hair, super elite professionals they are.  \n\nOverall a great experience, will definitely be back!  They do take out too and take phone orders.
