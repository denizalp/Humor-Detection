This is a not too bad place if you are looking for a cheap buffet with a decent selection.\n\nThe service was great, they topped my water off frequently and were talkative about the food, and our comfort.\n\nThe food is pretty good, but nothing amazing.  It is clearly \"watered\" down and lacks that real indian kick.\n\nYou won't be disappointed if you come here, but the service, cleanliness, and selection make it a great place for lunch, or quick non fancy dinner.
