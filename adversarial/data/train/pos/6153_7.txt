Look, it is THE place for ice cream in south Mississauga. It's been around forever, isn't going anywhere and is probably a licence to print money in the summer even with rising dairy costs. I could say that that the staff constantly swears at me (they don't) or that the soft serve is infested with bugs (it isn't) and people would still line up way out the door from April through September and the parking lot would still always be packed. \n\nSo what am I going to say? I already said it: it's THE place for ice cream near the lake in Mississauga. Love the soft serve dip cones, great sundaes, about a hundred options on the menu and about a million times more hipster appeal than DQ will ever have. Okay fine the staff may not be super friendly and the prices are a little high (see: rising price of dairy) but what are you going to do? Dairy Cream owns this town. There's another little place that opened less a couple of years back, down the road called Dairy King that give you pretty much the same stuff, similar prices, etc. You think they have the same lineups? Not a chance. \n\nDairy Cream is an institution in the area and people come from all around to have it so far as I can tell. So yeah, I guess I don't have much to add that hasn't already been said. Oh, I do need to try the funnel cake one of these days. I know: how can I review it without having tried the funnel cake? Cut me a break here though. The thing is meal in and of itself. I usually come after dinner and I'm only one man (plus can't share, fianc√©e is gluten and lactose intolerant). This does of course mean having ice cream for dinner though. What other choice do I have?
