We wanted to find a restaurant within Lake of Las Vegas, since that is where our cousins are staying with a 2 month old.  After giving up on finding a 4 star place to eat within the area, Earl made an executive decision to try out Sonrisa.  \n\nWhen we arrived on a Friday at 6:30ish pm, there were not many people at Lake of Las Vegas.  It was very dead.  When we got to the restaurant, there were not many guests there either.  \n\nThe food was mediocre at best.  I got the avocado rolls, Earl got the...I don't even remember.  It was so unmemorable.\n  \nEarl asked the waitress if they make good Michelada.  She said yes with confidence.  When she brought out the michelada, the color was off.  It was no bueno.\n\nSummary:  We won't be coming back.
