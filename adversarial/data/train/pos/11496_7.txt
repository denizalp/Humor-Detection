Stopped in for a quick lunch on Memorial Day. This was the only place open in the area. There was nobody in here when we came in, so the service was quick.\n\nI had a roast beef panini with swiss cheese and roasted red peppers. It was pretty good. The sandwich is quite large, and I didn't finish the whole thing.\n\nMy dad had some sort of egg breakfast bagel sandwich and he seemed to like it. This place was just alright, I think I prefer Bagel Me! more though.
