I initially found this company while looking for firewood in the fall. I've had a dying tree that I was hoping would turn around. When the wood was delivered, Shane gave me a price on the tree removal and I couldn't pull the trigger. To his credit, he followed up with me a few times and eventually sent me a direct mail piece in the Spring. Spring revealed that this tree was dead and needed to be removed so the timing was perfect. \n\nDue to his follow up, I decided he earned my business and called for a quote. Within a couple hours he was at my home and gave me a very fair estimate to remove the tree, leave the wood, and haul away the brush. Today the came out and did exactly that and more! \n\nThese guys are true professionals. They climbed the tree, roped off the branches, and gently lowered them to the ground being certain not to hit either of the adjacent houses or damage the lawn. \n\nThey even took care of a couple dead branches on a neighboring tree while they were within reach. \n\nWhen they were done they spent another ~ 30 minutes cleaning up. They raked all the twigs out of my yard and my neighbors yard. Then the blew the sawdust out of the grass and collected it. Finally they swept up the drive, sidewalk, and the areas around their vehicles and chipper in the street. The concrete areas around our place looked better than before they removed, chopped, and chipped a huge tree. \n\nThe guys were friendly yet down to business and I appreciated their concern for one another's safety - constantly alerting one another to falling debris and their whereabouts. \n\nTree removal is not a very fun thing to spend money on but I felt good spending my money hiring these hard working, fair, and conscientious professionals. Thanks again!
