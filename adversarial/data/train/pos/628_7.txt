Either they were just short staffed or they don't plan well.  I was there well before my appt and filled out the paperwork only to sit for over 20 min  and past my appt time.  Overheard receptionist tell a therapist that came up to take a client that she could take either one of us (another person also waiting) as someone did not show up.  Anyway, after settling into the room, the 45 min massage that was to be 60 min was anything but relaxing.  There was the constant loud ticking of the clock on the wall - WTF?  The therapist left the room during the massage to \"go get a chair\" - double WTF?  And she obviously needed to blow her nose too as the constant sniffing was annoying.  So massage over and go to check out only to find receptionist AWOL - after several min of standing there, a gentlemen checked me out and asked, would you like to schedule another appointment - not no but hell no!
