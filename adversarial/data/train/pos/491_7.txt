Excellent. \n\nMy husband surprised me at work last week with their lunch specials. The food was so good, that we had to go back for more today. \n\nI love sweet and sour chicken, and my husband enjoys spicy Mongolian Beef. He asked for his 'extra spicy', and they did not disappoint. One of the few places that actually made it as spicy as he wanted. \n\nThey offer the lunch special every day of the week, and we got ours with the fried rice and chow mein noodles. The to-go boxes are jam-packed. It is literally as much as will fit in the box. Who does that?! Awesome. The kitchen here is open, and you can see everything they are doing. Nice touch. \n\nThe people here seem proud of the food that they make, and are very friendly. This place is a hidden gem. We got two lunch specials, out the door for $12.84.
