OK great place, awesome beers and really modern and cool inside. Obviously the arcade games are a unique and highly awesome feature.\n\nHOWEVER, had a god awful experience with the manager lady with the bad haircut.\n\nShe. was. not. getting. it.\n\nShe asked us to leave \"for being the loudest people at the bar\" at 1:30 in the morning. Not for causing a ruckus, or being obnoxious. For simply having fun and being loud, at. a. bar. late. at. night. \n\nnot. a starbucks. at. noon.\n\nSo, no warning or anything. The bartender stepped in and said we were good and he'd make sure we'd behave or what not.\n\nSo just a really bad call by this employee. I get it, these environments can be frustrating, dealing with drunk people and what have ya. And who knows, she could be normally cool and was just having a bad day. But she should be accustomed to this type of setting and handled the situation better, considering. I was offended, this lady dealt with us horribly so.\n\nReal bad.\n\nAgain, a kick ass bar though.
