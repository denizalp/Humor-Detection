I've visited this Cheesecake Factory on several occasions and really shocked to see I haven't reviewed yet so, here goes...\n\nThis location is situated smack dab in the middle of Southside Works and has a classy kinda feel to it. It's beautiful inside and I love how some of the seating is very intimate. The service here is always great which leads me to believe whoever is running this one knows what they are doing and they're employees are happy...it shows. \n\nThe food was soooo good. My order of chicken piccata had that burst of fresh lemon and caper sauce with a side of angel hair. The chicken was moist and tender and absorbed the light sauce well.\n\nOn a final note, get here early on a Saturday night because the wait is LONG. No reservations are accepted on the weekends. With that said, if you have good company to keep your attention, the wait is a non-issue :)
