One of the ladies at work praises NBC to high heavens which made me read Yelp reviews which led me to NBC on S. Eastern right after work.  I was expecting a packed place since majority of the reviews claimed they're always packed but I walked in to a customerless bakery with 2 lady staff\/cashiers.\n\nAnyway, after I was nicely greeted I proceeded to their display thingy and bought 3 bundtinis (carrot, double chocolate chip and red velvet).  Boy, did they wrap those thingies fancy! Got home, ripped the nice packaging and ate one bundtini  (but didn't finish) a day for 3 days, and wondered:  What's all the fuss?  Maybe its my tastebuds.  They were good, and definitely pricey, but not orgasmically the best and the greatest muffins.   Would I go back and pay that much for a bundtini?  No!.  Would I go back if somebody paid for my bundtini? Hell to the freaking YEAH!  Otherwise, I'm happy with and will settle for the Costco butter pound muffins for $6.99 plus tax a dozen.  \n\nOh, and please, don't hate :).
