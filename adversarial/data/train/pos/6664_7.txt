Came here last night post Terry Fator with some of my favorite Yelpers. Kudos for the staff for letting us take over the patio. We were loud and obnoxious, so we all had a fabulous time.\n\nThe only Korean food I have ever encountered was the BBQ; who doesn't like grilled meats? Anyway, not knowing anything, I let the experts order. I for the most part had no idea what I ate. None of it stuck because I didn't particularly care for it. The beef nonsoup dishes were the best, although not memberable. \n\nI found the tastes to be either lackluster, underwhelming, or just spicy. Nothing that really hit it out of the ballpark for me or piqued my interest in venturing into Korean cuisine anytime soon or ever again for that matter.\n\nService was alright. We had to constantly ask for more silverware, more cups, more tea, more almost everything. I think this is mainly because we were the overzealous group on the patio. \n\nSoyo, more like a SOY-NO. Kimchi is not for me.
