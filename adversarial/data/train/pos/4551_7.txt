1\/5 is my rating. \n\nPeople say that Khao San Road is one of the better places to eat in Toronto for Thai Food... \n\nHOWEVER, when your place has horrible customer service coming from, who seemingly is, the owner, I am not going to eat at your restaurant. If you are threatening to give away my seat when I have 19\/20 of my people after I booked a reservation and your restaurant isn't even full, you're taking a 1\/5 hands down. \n\nThere are so many better places than KSR. I suggest Pai (https:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz\/pai-northern-thai-kitchen-toronto-5); it's pretty close to them and their food + customer service is definitely better too. \n\nYeah, I've been to a lot of restaurants and this is probably the WORST customer service ever. Especially when it's from the owner. 100% Would not recommend.
