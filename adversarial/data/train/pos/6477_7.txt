I feel so apathetic about this business that I almost don't want to write this review, but I'll do it anyway.\n\nPho King is a new Vietnamese restaurant that has popped up in an increasingly popular section of Eastern Avenue south of 215. They're in the corner of the EOS Fitness plaza, right next to one of my favorite poke bowl spots, so I've seen their signage, laughed at their name, and eagerly looked forward to their opening. When their grand opening weekend finally arrived a couple of weeks ago, I jumped at the chance\n\nI ordered the Com Bo Luc Lac ($12.50), a popular dish commonly referred to as \"shaking beef\" in English. I was already concerned by the lack of tomato rice and fish sauce-based dipping sauce, and the dish indeed lacked flavor. Some restaurants can pull off getting enough flavor in the beef that you don't need anything else, but this isn't one of them. The other warning sign for me was how quickly the dish was brought out. Although they did sear the beef cubes well, they only got most of the cubes to a rare cook at best. Oh, and the white rice was discernibly on the mushy side.\n\nI also tried a bit of my friend's Pho Dac Biet ($9.75) and immediately decided that I wasn't very interested in having any more to do with it. The broth of beef pho should be complex, but it simply wasn't anything special. Hopefully, he'll get around to writing his full review on that soon.\n\nI've had opportunities to try Pho King again during the remainder of their 20% off promotion (which they ran from the start and extended through the end of October), but I've passed on them. With the full prices in effect, I can't envision myself coming back to try anything else unless I get really bored of all the other new businesses while simultaneously getting recommendations from people who have more experience with Vietnamese food than just the relatively lackluster stuff around Las Vegas.
