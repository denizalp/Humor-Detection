Much like Leonard's comment, this WAS a nice place a couple years back...not any longer.  I moved here in 2011, and really liked the location, staff, maintenance, neighbors. Now, this place has done a complete 180. There is poop in the grass from owner's not picking up after their dogs, the parking is horrendous (they need assigned spots), and the cost per unit has gone up more than its worth.\n\nPersonal issue:  My downstairs neighbor was constantly fighting, screaming with his partner, and playing loud music, regardless of the time. After speaking with management, their reply was there wasn't much they could do about it and to call metro.  REALLY?!  Well metro did come out, at least 4 different times, from neighbor's complaints and calls. Management did nothing to help the situation.  \n \nThe floor plans are nice, they have 3 pools, it is gated (which doesn't matter to me anymore since anyone can get in by just waiting at the gate), the police precinct is down the street, and it's near the freeway.  \n\nMy lease is up in a couple months, and I am not renewing. They need better management. They also need to either lower their prices or have better standards when allowing tenants to move in.
