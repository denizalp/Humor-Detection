My husband and I bought our Jeep from another dealership in the area but live closer to this one so when our check engine light came on we stopped to make sure it was OK to drive it. All the gentleman had to do was stick the reader in the port. After making a big sigh he told us we were over our warranty and he would need a couple of hours to look at it. My husband and I felt so sketched out we got our keys back immediately and decided to chance it and drive it up to our dealer in Lake Norman. Lake Norman checked it in literally 2 seconds and said it was an oil sensor (typical in grand jeeps). We told him what happened and he said that sounded weird because this is a very normal issue. All and all, I think Stateline just wanted to take our car and \/find\/ something really wrong  to get us to pay big money. Never going back.
