Clean, classy, and like a blast from the past.  \n\nI have fond memories of visiting a See's Candy store as a kid -- smelling the fresh chocolate and letting my gaze wander over the amazing selection of chocolates.  \n\nNot much has changed in 20-30 years.    And to be honest, I think that's a good thing.  \n\nThe showroom might seem sterile and, well ...  'white'.  (Almost like a really clean and spacious bathroom).  \n\nBut be sure to ask for whatever samples they might have available -- they won't even make you buy anything (but I dare you to walk out without giving some of your money to those nice old ladies that work behind the counter).\n\nI've taken my two daughters there (11 and 8) and they keep asking me when we're going to go back.  The staff at See's Candy's really seem to know how to treat kids nicely.\n\nI'd give this place 5 stars, but their prices are a bit high.  You do get a quality product, but you definitely pay for it.
