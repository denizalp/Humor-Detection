Love Carolinas!  Been to the one on Cactus a handful of times and have been incredibly impressed with their beef tacos.  Have been to this one a handful of times and have had pretty good meals.  While not as good as the Cactus location (Still haven't been to the OG one downtown), their beef tacos were still good.  I was telling my wife how good they were and decided to come down here and show her what was up!  \n\nWe placed our order for a combo #9, 4 shredded beef tacos, and a beef flauta for my son.  Total came out to $18.47.  Swiped my card, signed the receipt, got our salsas, waters etc and sat down.  A few minutes later, the food was ready.\n\nMy wife thought the beef tacos were just ok (she prefers other places like Lolitas, Fredericos etc).  Mine were as good as the Peoria location can be (still not as good as Cactus) .  My son ate a little bit of the beef flauta.  Meal completed, left, and everything was good.\n\nEverything sounds great so far, right?  Well, it was....until I looked at my bank statement.  My bank statement showed a pending transaction from Carolinas for $23.47.  I thought it might have been an error, and it was pending for a good 4 days.  Know what though?  It cleared my account!  Someone added on $5.00 to my bill!  That is small enough for a lot of people not to notice, but that is also bullshit and will not fly with me.  I called my bank and they immediately refunded the money into my account.  They told me that if the merchant disputed it, I may see a charge back to my account (Which is what should have happened in the first place...I should have been charged $18.47 for the food I ordered!).  \n\nAnyways....I will be leery to come back here.  Ill take the drive to the Cactus location instead.  If there is a slim chance I do come back here to the Peoria one, I will most definitely be paying in CASH!  Watch your receipts at this place if you pay with your card!
