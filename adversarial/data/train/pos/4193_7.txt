Even though it's clear across town for me and has a limited menu with higher prices than I'd typically pay for a beverage, I can't seem to stop stopping by Matcha House- specifically for the Imperial Matcha, with 50% sweetness and light ice. The robust tea flavor and light, complementary sweetness really hits the spot for me, but heads up that it's about $7.\n\nThe cheese mousse, intended to impart a creamy texture, is cool but dilutes the flavors I prefer. Perhaps it pairs better with a different tea. I've sampled the osmanthus oolong (refreshing!) and house black milk tea (creamy!) but still stick to the order above, have never tried their boba and their drinks honestly don't need additions.\n\nI initially avoided the desserts, seeing small servings for the price. A friend ordered the Very Berry Honey Bread with green tea and vanilla ice cream and it was a sugar rush for sure but still shareable despite not upgrading to the full toast size. Signage indicates they'll be adding matcha desserts soon, which may be worth the splurge if they have unique items like mini cheesecakes, cream puffs, or (can a girl dream?) soft serve. \n\nBonus points for offering late hours, free wifi, a variety of seating arrangements, and table games for those who come to socialize or study!
