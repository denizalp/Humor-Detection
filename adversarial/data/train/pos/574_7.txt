What happens when you promise a friend to meet up for Gelato to cool off after a hot week in Toronto? Well, you would live up to that promise, because, you know, that's just how promises work -- even after a massive storm when temperatures dip like mad. \n\nVika and I have not been to their location on Baldwin Village before so it's our first time trying out Kekou after hearing positive raves from friends about their nostalgic but much-desired Gelato flavours like Hong Kong Milk Tea, Durian and Pandan (think sweet Asian Grass Vanilla) -- we had to try this place out. \n\nAfter sampling a wide variety of flavours (no shame there, really) we went with Hong Kong Milk Tea & Viet Coffee to replicate that \"Ying Yong\" feel of a popular Hong Kong-based beverage.\n\nIf you ever feel overwhelmed with all the flavours in this place -- we would recommend this combination. \n\nSeriously, what better way to cool off eh?\n\nOther Recommendations:\n\n1. Durian (it's as good as eating the real fruit)\n2. Green Tea Whiskey \n3. Peanut Sesame\n4. Hong Kong Milk Tea \n5. Banana Avocado (try it beforehand, it can be a bit \"funky\")
