Full disclosure, I went with my aunt who loves this place and she ordered everything so I am going to describe the dish but can't for the life of me tell you what it's called on the menu.\n\nFirst, great place for vegans. They really take their vegetarian label seriously. Everything is tofu - we were there for a birthday party and couldn't bring in a cake because there were eggs in it! Props!\n\nWe started with fried wontons - really crispy with a nice mushroom and tofu filling. \nHot and sour soup - so worth it! It's just the right amount of sour and spicy, although, sadly as a meat eater, I do prefer the version with pork at other places (please don't hate me).\nThey had fake duck - pan fried tofu sheets ... Money in the bank. I could have just eaten that all day and night and the next day.\nI don't know what these were called but they were deep fried twists and inside were soft gluten balls. OMG. Just kill me now. A-mah-zing. Order 2 portions. Do it.\nWe also had noodles (not really my thing. Were super chewy) and black rice.\nDeep fried soft tofu balls - the sauce makes it but instead of dipping it in the mushroom sauce, ask for their house hot sauce. YUM!\n\nI mean everything here was deep fried or fried fried... Maybe that's why everything is so tasty because everything tastes better crispy. There's a lot of MSG in the food, I guess that's the toss up to having no animal fat!\n\nI'd go back, maybe skimp on the deep friedness a little next time.\n\nGo tofu!
