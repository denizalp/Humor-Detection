Wow.\n\nQuite possibly the worst meal I have had in my life.\n\nDefinitely the worst potuguese chicken I've ever had. \n\nWhere to start.\n\nChicken tasteless despite asking for spicy, no seasoning present whatsoever.\n\nPotatoes weren't even cooked properly, I've never been served uncooked potatoes ever.\n\nSalad no dressing.\n\nNo piri piri with chicken.\n\nHard skip guys. Don't fall for the litany of reviewers with less than 10 total reviews I actually walked to the garbage can and threw out more than half of this travesty.\n\nI can't believe it was this bad.
