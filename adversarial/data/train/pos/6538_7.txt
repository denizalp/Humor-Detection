My husband and I can't stop talking about the flaky crust of our apple crumb pie, it was delicious.  I am glad they are so far away from us, otherwise I would be there everyday.  We went late in the day, so there were not that many options, but I was glad they had my favorite kind of pie.  I might try another flavor some other time, it is definitely worth the trip.
