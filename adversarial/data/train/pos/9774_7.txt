By far the worst tacos I have ever consumed. I love tacos and coming from Texas I was really looking forward to this place after numerous people said I needed to try it. Tacos El Buen is a small hole in the wall which normally means great tacos. Wasnt that clean but I assumed with 24hour service and long lines that was the reason for the lack of cleanliness.  WRONG! After waiting 20min in line to order 2 shrimp tacos and  pastor tacos and 2 asada tacos I finally got my order. I put the toppings on my tacos and my friends placed their toppings on the remaining 4 tacos. The shrimp had zero flavor, the only thing I can say was good was the hot green sauce. Fast forward an hour, all 3 of us are up vomiting with stomach cramps. Lets just say the shrimp were still swimming after my 3 hour flight back home. I will never eat here again.\n\nUpdate: just left the hospital and it's the stomach flu. I guess the house does always win
