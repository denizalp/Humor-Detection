Fat Bastard Burrito opens till 4am on Fridays and Saturdays!! It is the best thing I had at 3 am after couple of drinks (1,2,3,4,5,6.. ) on Queen West.\n\nThe lines seems to be long, but the friendly staff are just so efficient and it took around 10 minute for my order to be ready after I customize all the toppings (love the selections! noodles, cilantro, jalapenos, guac and more).\n\nI really enjoyed the Battered Fish Burrito ($8.99) and Baja Chipotle Chicken Quesadillas ($8.49) I ordered to share as the after crawl snacks. Good value, tasty, fast and filling! \n\nFat Bastard Burrito definitely my to go place for some comforting food after a night of drinking on West Queen West!\n\nI love Fat Bastard!\n\nP.S. no photos of the food because I was hungry, because I was drunk, because it was 3 am.. I just want to eat the damn thing!
