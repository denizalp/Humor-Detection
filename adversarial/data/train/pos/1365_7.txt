This five guys rocks ! Can we say always on point with the orders.  \n\nI'm all about the lettuce buns these days , and what better burger place to deliver greatness? I don't know what it is about the preparation of their burgers but it's always satisfying . I usually get cheeseburger with cooked onions , mushrooms , and whatever condiment your heart desires . Simple , hearty, and well worth the price tag associated with it , my family can easily spend a cool $46 here in one trip . \n\nAside from the well crafted burgers , my daughter raves about the fries . I mean a small is enough for two people to share and if you eat in you can feast on the fresh roasted peanuts until your order is ready . \n\nThank goodness for excellent training here, this locations crew is quick and thorough.  High five to the management staff, been visiting this location for years now and not one complaint here .
