I'm rating off of bar service & hearing complaints that were crazy while I was there.  As I waited for a glass of wine before my Wonder Woman movie at Galaxy, I was served somewhat of a wine tasting from Marquis.  He wanted to be sure that I liked the wine & knowing that I was in a rush, he was quick serving & cashing me out.  Chad walks by & says how is your day, is there anything else I can get for you?  Super nice.  \nOne lady complained that he didn't ask for her ID, but did for her friend.  Another had been late to pick up her order so requested new drinks since by now they were watered down.  The manager, a short haired blond lady was so kind to her & even issued a $15 gift card for fixing that drink order.  There were a couple of other incidents that I found ridiculous in a very short amount of time & thankfully I do not work there cause in this scenario, a few customers were not right.  Everyone at the bar treated them so kind, too kind.  Anyways, I ordered a drink & left in thirty-five minutes, as I killed time before the movie, had no food & sat at the bar.
