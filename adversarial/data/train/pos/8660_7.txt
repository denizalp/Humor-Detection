As a fast food joint my expectations are not high, but when you give me cool, somewhat soggy onion rings and a cold whopper dang!\n\nI love the onion ring sauce and am convinced they put cocaine in it.  That saved my otherwise lackluster meal.  Also, the drive through was fast.  There, I said something nice.
