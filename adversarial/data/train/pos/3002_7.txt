I wish there was no star. I bought some lemon soft top cookies and it cracked my tooth as it had a small piece of gumdrop type of candy that was not melted down. I filed a claim and they basically said I am lying and have no proof. I am not trying to take advantage of them as I am not broke but they should pay $350 as I had to have my tooth pulled out. I have convinced my family and friends not to shop at Smith's, Kroger and Ralph's. I am a strong believer in karma and it will come back and bite them in the butt one day. There is Wal-Mart about 3 blocks away, which has much better prices anyway.\n\nUpdate- I have not shopped at Smith's since this happened and they have lost hundreds of dollars just from me and that satisfies me. I have convinced few others not to shop at Smith's. They do not care about their customers.
