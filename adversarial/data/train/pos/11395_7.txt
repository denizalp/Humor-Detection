Breakfast, old-school Vegas style at the Golden Gate Casino.  I've lived here for 20 years and never been to the Golden Gate until Yelp told me that I should go and check out the pancakes.  Esquire Magazine said they're the best in the nation--really?  As a fan of Babystacks Cafe, I felt like a traitor the first time I ate here, but they are really two different experiences.  There's nothing like parking at Binion's and walking through the Fremont Experience with the all the lights, the sounds, the drunks, and the smoke to get to the restaurant.  The Golden Gate this morning didn't seem as smoky, though, which was nice.  I brought my gal pal who'd never been there and although she doesn't like pancakes, she loved the bacon--weird.  I had the Hotcake Sandwiches special, which was two pancakes, 1 egg, and 1 slice of bacon. The egg and bacon were standard issue, nothing special.  The pancakes, though, were scrumptious.  Fluffy and full of buttter--very rich tasting.  I couldn't even finish one of them and I don't know why!  I still love the Cinnabun pancakes at Babystacks the best, but if you're a fan of buttermilk pancakes, get downtown and experience these for yourself.
