I'm gonna jump on the hype train and say this place is hella fun, and serves a quality product at prices that will make your eyes widen in disbelief. Like seriously, you can knock down some beers, and especially mixed beverages without a dent in your wallet. \n\nThe seating is almost exclusively long tables, with comfy booths lining one wall. When weather permits, the outdoor canopy is pretty neat, especially since all the couches are new. \n\nThey pride themselves in a full menu as well, and while yours truly hasn't had it yet, I've noticed they do appear to partake in Taco Tuesday, where you can get your hands on some hard-shelled snacks. Overall, I like it a lot...it's a dive that doesn't realize it's a dive. My only concern is the bit of an identity crisis it's having. The sound system is weak, it's too brightly lit, and there's virtually no standing room, so it feels like a straight up restaurant despite the jukebox and billiard tables. As a result, The Glass House comes across as a place I really can't recommend for spending an entire weekend night, but rather as a welcome destination for knocking a couple back after work.
