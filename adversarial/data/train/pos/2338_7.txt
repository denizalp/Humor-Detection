Unfortunately  For us, it seems like hit and runs in Arizona are a common occurrence. I have had three alone in the few years that I have lived here! \n\nLucky for us though, we have Corey at gateway auto body!!! I have had my car fixed at other body shops several times and Corey is by far the best and most honest body shop around. \n\nTrust me when I tell you, you'll be glad you called him!
