It's an older crowd for sure, but is fun for any age if you go with a group.  Almost all country music, but the regular crowd on the dance floor is pretty entertaining.  \n\nA lot of  \"cougars\" and plenty of opportunity for debauchery if you are a guy in your 20s... if that's the direction you are looking to go.  Drinks are cheap, so that should help you make some bad decisions.\n\nThere seem to be a lot of fights at this bar.  Then again, that can be fun to watch too.
