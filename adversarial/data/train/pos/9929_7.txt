Three months ago, I received an email offering to stay at The Cosmopolitan for $109 a night during the Halloween weekend. Booked my stay with an upgraded room for $400 for two nights. 48 hours in Vegas is great. More than that is like over eating!\n\nIt's now two weeks away from my trip and the same package is now $1300. Trick or treat? You decide.
