This place is the SHIZZNIT!! I wish I remembered my bartenders name, working the Sunday afternoon shift, she was a cutie for sure! Had a little loud mouth on her, but very entertaining! She recommended the pork belly dish, which was AMAZING! \n\nGreat bar concept. I've put together a few bars myself doing Audiovisual and surveillance, but whoever did this, I like it! I wish I live on this side of town cause I would visit more often. Keep it up Sporting Life Bar!
