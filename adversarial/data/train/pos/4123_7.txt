R.I.P,\n\nDeep Blue was the king of Fish and chips. No matter how hard I try I cannot find a suitable replacement for the ambrosia that was deep blue fish and chips. They did absolutely everything perfectly, the traditional fish and chips were nicely battered and so fresh you could swear they just pulled the potato out of the ground and the fish out of the ocean, they must have changed the oil just about every time a different person ordered.\n\nnot only did they have delicious traditional fish and chips, they also made their own tartar sauce, as well as other original sauces such as tropical coleslaw that they created (I have never had such a beautiful balance of quality food & sauce).\n\nin addition to the traditional fish and chips, they had other variants such as Jerk, Cajun, and Malaysian batters, whilst having potato and sweet potato fries. It almost brings a tear to my eye knowing that I will never again eat this blessing that they serve as food.\n\nI tried just about everything on the menu and every single item was delicious. Everyone I know, even people I don't like said that this place is a legend among fish and chips and is incomparable to anything else.\n\nI hope that one day again they will open as they managed and deserved a thriving business. But for now all is lost.\n\n:(
