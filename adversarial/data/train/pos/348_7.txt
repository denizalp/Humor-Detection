Had the pleasure of attending my first ever yelp event for Yelpoween 2018. \n\nThe location that was selected was really cool the whole place really did feel like an abandoned little bar, but it was quite tiny once everyone started getting packed in. The cocktails that were suggested by bar staff were cool and the addition of the bar top candy shop was amazing. \n\nThe back terrace was the place to be to sample foods from many amazing restaurants. I enjoyed chowing down on pho, salads, cookies, burgers and brownies!  It's probably a good thing that we had a limited amount of coupons because I could have eaten for days. \n\nEveryone who attended had a great vibe and costume choice were fun, but the show stopper was definitely the dog and their owner who was also dressed as a dog ! \n\nCan't wait to see the next event!
