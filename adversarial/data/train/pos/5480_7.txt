Loved it.\n\nI had a salad (boring I know). But it was amazing. Really fresh and delicious cheese (I have no idea what kind however), great guacamole, and a strong and wonderful 3330 margarita. \n\nThe waiters were fairly attentive and the food didn't take too long. I think we were there until their closing time or 9:30 or 10. The restaurant appeared to be very friendly to all types of families. The atmosphere was super comfortable but still had a decor and an appropriate level of mex restaurant ambiance.\n\nThe sign out front is the best part though! It's a great place to grab a meal and judging by the margarita probably an ok place to just have chips and drinks too!
