I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed because I don't know how to start my review....do I just profess my love in general? Admit that I am addicted to the energy drink, Rooster Booster, that they keep on tap?  \n\nThe thing that really separates QT from other gas stations is their delightful array of slushi drinks. They have more flavors than Circle K and Seven Eleven combined. I like to use a slushi drink in replace of ice...so, white cherry slushi + coke = cherry coke.  You can get crazy with it, add watermelon to Sprite, and pina colada to Rooster Booster.  You can try doing this at Seven Eleven, with their sub-par slushies, but I can guarantee you that the dude behind the register will stare you down until you break into a cold sweat, and three video cameras will zoom in on your every move.  If you want slushy at Seven Eleven, you must pay for slushi!\n\nBut not at Quick Trip...they invite you to mix their slushies with your soda.  Their commercials even encourage it.  THANK YOU QUICK TRIP, for challenging my creativity and ingenuity.\n\nSo now that I provided that crucial background information, it is time to reveal what makes this particular QT so particularly amazing.\n\nAre you ready?\n\nTHEY HAVE 22 FLAVORS OF SLUSHI.\n\nThere are three different blue flavors, eight red\/pink flavors and multiple neon flavors.\nThey even have a sugar-free flavor, so if your digestive track can handle sugar-free stuff, you can drink these every day and call it a diet.  WINNING!\n\nAnd if your slushi-soda combination creates a reaction and your cup overflows, do not fear...according to the QT worker today, \"it happens all the time.\"  And that is probably why he appeared out of thin air before I even realized that my cup was combusting.  He came with paper towels, a smile, and a floor cleaning machine. You just have to love a place that never has sticky floors.
