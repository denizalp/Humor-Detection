Ah the Mean Bull.. or as most people whisper about it.. that bar connected to the bathhouse.. \n\nYes, it's connected to a bathouse.. Yes. Techincally you could walk between the two.. but you don't have to. \n\nI wish this club was somewhere else, if it was I think it'll do much better!  The decor is awesome!  They really spent a good penny making a very nice looking space, not huge, but really this is Cleveland.. \n\nThey have great drink specials.. all the time.. trying to get people in the door I guess...
