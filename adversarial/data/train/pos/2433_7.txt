Man, this Baby Loves Tacos and the tacos at Baby Loves Tacos.  Have stopped by in the past but they were not open at the time I stopped due to just starting up and not having consistent hours during soft opening.  Finally open hours are listed on the website.  Yea!  \nAlso, finally have signage.  \nTried the 3 for $10 taco option.  Can't go wrong with any.  The Spicy Brisket just came out of the oven and was perfect.  The Chorizo was also tasty with a nice spicy flavor. The chicken was good but not as spicy.  If you are in the area and looking for a fast meal and tacos you should definitely stop in.  The tacos come with salsa, cilantro, lime, fresh tomato and you can get gauc.
