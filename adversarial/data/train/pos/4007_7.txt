Worst home warranty company EVER! Do not use them. We have literally been going back and forth with them for over one month on our pool pump motor that they now refuse to replace after stating 3 times now it would be covered. Meanwhile we cannot use our pool in the summertime in Arizona. Unacceptable! Their claims department has zero knowledge on equipment and they are horrible at following up with you. \n\nDo yourself a favor and find another company. Unless you want to spend all of your free time dealing with these people and never getting an outcome.
