I'm Nova Scotian, the weather is getting warmer, thus I have lobster on the brain. Just thinking about them tikatika*-ing across the Atlantic floor makes me want to run out and buy a pound of butter. \n\nWhen I feel like a high roller and am at St. Lawrence getting my cheeses and mustard already, I head to Buster's Sea Cove. It's $20 for a very full and lightly seasoned lobster roll, and it's worth it. You deserve it, treat yo'self. It comes with thick yet crispy fries and a slaw, and the bun is warm and buttery. Their mayo to lobster to green onion ratio is just right, and they don't skimp on how much they shmush in there. \n\nAll the fish fry coming our of this place looks terrific, but I will go for lobster every time, so I will never know what it's like. \n\n*I've been told that's the sound of me sneaking off to get a snack, and I've decided it's also the sound of crustaceans scurrying along ocean floors.
