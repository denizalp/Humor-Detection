Haven't been to Caesar's in awhile but always a pleasure to stay at the Palace. Can't give maximus star rating since several amenities were minimus. Room had no hair dryer. Keurig coffee maker on-hand but where were the coffee, cups, creamer, etc.? Not complimentary anymore? Not hailing to Caesar for missing this boat. Reserved 3 lounge chairs at the gorgeous pool area but the chairs reserved for us were nowhere near the pool and facing a huge structure.  And many lounge chairs were ratted, so obviously overused and much in need of replacement. WTF Caesar? Paid, reserved lounge chairs should be near the Roman gods and in immaculate shape for visiting goddesses. We opted to seat in the area for peasants. Free and facing the pools! Going to pay homage to other new hotels for next visit.
