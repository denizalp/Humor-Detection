This place is just insane.  I should end my review here.  But then, I'd be a bad Yelper.  Let me explain.\n\nThere is this obsession with quantity in our culture, and Hash House is the epitome of this obsession.  I was awe struck by the mountains of cooked flesh and grease that was being served all around me.  People were taking pictures of their food (no doubt to post on Yelp).  As I waited for my french toast, I wondered how much of this stuff people cram into their bodies every day.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I'm not a health nut.  I could care less really, but even I have my limits.  My french toast with bananas on it tasted awesome for the first few bites.  However, after chewing on this thing for a while, I got bored.  That's right... as big and overblown as the food in this place is, I got bored of eating it.  And this, my friends, is the failing of Hash House A Go Go. :-)
