It makes me sad to only give this place three stars, as its a new local business. \nIt's very nicely decorated inside and with comfortable and abundant seating. There was only one other person there when I arrived and during my visit around lunch hours. \nPizza menu is very Persian-influenced, and the counter up front has pictures so it is helpful to look at as you decide what to order. My boyfriend had the individual sized buffalo chicken pizza and me the margherita pizza (tomatoes, cheese, basil) and an order of fries. With a BoGo coupon, our total came to be about $11. \nTaste was quite mediocre, nothing too special although the dough was chewy and good. Order of fries was pretty small for $3. Probably not worth the full price. They do have 15% off for showing your UNLV student ID.
