So I went here on a date this past weekend and I have good things and bad things to say. \nFirst off the decor. Omg!!! It's like a fancy restaurant from the 70's!! It is terribly ugly!!! So don't go here expecting a good view. There were these globes hanging from the ceiling by paper clips. The whole thing was bad. Also we were the only people under the age of 65 in there. Defiantly an older crowd. \nButttttt\nThe food was great! My date got spaghetti which wasn't anything special. It didn't have enough sauce on it and it just was whatever. But my food was fantastic!! I got the pene al fadoro. Or something like that and It was so good! This place is a little over priced for what you get. I wouldn't ever go here again even as much as I liked my food because of the atmosphere and price.
