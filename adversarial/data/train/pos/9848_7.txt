This place is awesome! They have a nice menu with a good amount of sandwiches and other items. There is 100+ flavor coke machine as well! The place is decorator with a lot of fun stuff and bright colors. I tried the Mihami Vice, which was a warm sandwich, and it was sooooo good! Got to try out the party tots as well. It had avocado and jalape√±os on it! \n\nThe staff were really passionate about the company and why they do. Service is pretty fast too. They donate the cost of every sandwich they sell to charity. There are about four different charities that they work with. They do this in every community that they have stores in.\n\nThey originated in Utah and have been expanding.\n\nThis location is on bell and has a lot around it but there is plenty of parking. Shouldn't have to walk too far, even on a busy night.\n\nEveryone, go try this place out! You will not be disappointed!
