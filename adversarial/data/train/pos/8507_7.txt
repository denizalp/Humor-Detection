We had a lot of fun playing the vintage video games, and the drinks were good, too.  My guy liked the selection of craft beers, including the Deschute's IPA on draft, and I enjoyed the Invader and the Princess Peach mixed drinks.\n\nIt gets pretty loud with the DJ and games blaring, and it gets hot inside the arcade, especially when crowded.\n\nHowever, it still is a lot of fun, and the prices are reasonable.
