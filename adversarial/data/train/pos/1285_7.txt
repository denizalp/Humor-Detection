I really wanted to come here and throw my food against the wall and say \"This is sh!ts! It's Rawwwwww! You donkey.....but......\n\nFish & Chips Combo - I opted for the tartar sauce and Sriracha Aioli. The fish was crispy on the outside and fish was tender on the inside.\n\nShrimp & Chips combo - My brother opted for 2 Curry & Mango sauces. The shrimp was mariniated and lightly fried. My brother said he preferred a heavy batter - Boy crazy! \n\nThe chips were very potatoe-y (I don't care it's not a word) and heavy tasting. \n\nThe seating does feel a bit cramped. I think the pricing was good for what you get. Would come and try it again!
