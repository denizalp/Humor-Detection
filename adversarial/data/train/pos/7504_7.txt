The person that saw my daughter didn't seem very knowledgable about a solution and we had to ask probing questions to get information that we feel they should have provided to us without us having to ask. The end result was they wanted us to send our daughter to a children's hospital because they said her oxygen was low. She gave us a feeling of uncertainty and we left feeling more disappointed and unsure as to why we even went there in the first place. We never ended up taking her to the children's hospital and bought a device to monitor her until we could see her normal pediatrician. Her oxygen levels were fine the whole night after we had our daughter cough to get some of the congestion from her chest so she could breathe a little better. We followed up with the pediatrician the next day and  she too felt that it was unnecessary for them to recommend going to a children's hospital. Our pediatrician gave her a breathing treatment to clean her lungs a bit and an antibiotic and she was on her way to recovery. I will not recommend based off this last experience . You did nothing to assist me and you wasted my time and my money.
