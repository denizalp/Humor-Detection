Pedro's is great for Mexican style comfort food. It's a real neighborhood gem. I've loved Pedro's since the first time I tried it in 1996.  I always go in and order the green chunky beef enchiladas with rice and beans. The green chile is not hot at all and it is almost broth-like. The rice is cooked and seasoned perfectly. The service is always a little touch and go. Sometimes you find a waitress in a good mood who is attentive and then you find one that's strictly business with barely any warmth. So don't go there for hugs and kisses, just good food!\nPedro's is a fixture in Glendale, and I hope it's there for many more years!
