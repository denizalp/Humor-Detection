Why haven't I tried this place earlier??  It was excellent!  I LOVE that they have all kinds of alternative choices if you don't want fries\/chips.  I had the haddock and fried mushrooms, turns out you get mushrooms AND some fries as well. \n\nThe food wasn't too greasy considering it was all fried.  \n\nIt comes in a little box with some printed paper.  There's only a couple of seats inside and the patio is quite small.  If you come here in the winter, plan to take it home.    \n\nPrice wasn't too bad considering how much food you get.
