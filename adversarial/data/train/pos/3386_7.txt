I will never shop at this place again.  They had a power recliner on their website for $749.00.  They were advertising a \"50 percent off all furniture\" sale this past Memorial Day weekend.  When I went into the store to look at this recliner, it was \"on sale\" for $649.00.  When I questioned the sales person about it, she said no, it was 50 percent off $1399, the \"compare at\" price.  ?????????  So, basically, they made up the $1399 price?  So they then avoid taking 50 percent off the LISTED price of $749?  I felt like I was in a used car lot.  I will never, ever go to this store again.  They have lost my trust and my business.  I went to Lazy Boy and bought a chair for $399.00, no bait and switch price, no arbitraray \"compare at\" price, just the actual price of the chair.
