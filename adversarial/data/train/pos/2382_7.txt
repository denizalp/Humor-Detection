Take a trip south, south of downtown, south of the 17 to find your way to Carniceria Castillo for some of the best Carne Asada in Phoenix. Drive to south mountain take in a hike or the views and do yourself a favor and stop in for their cooked carne on your way back. You'll find this market along the road, it's easy to pass right by, but they're likely cooking something out front on their BBQ grill and it's probably the chicken or beef you'll be eating in your tacos, burritos or nachos later that day and for the next few days to come. \n\nOrder a couple pounds because two pounds magically seems like three or four every time I order. Don't forget to peruse through the market for a Candy Coconut Roll, cause those things are awesome.\n\nHappy Yelping Phoenix, eat more carne asada and eat it from here.
