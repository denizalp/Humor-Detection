What do Hanny's and a trumpet player have in common?  Nothing actually, but while I was enjoying a Pimm's cup the Bad Cactus Brass Band spontaneously paraded itself around the dining room to the tune of  When the Saints Go Marching In.  \n\nHanny's was pretty empty for what is normally considered rush hour on a Friday night.  It also gave me the feeling of being in a train station, not sure why exactly.  Maybe it's the color scheme, it's sort of monochromatic with black, grey and a pop of white.  It also feels cold and usually I'm cold when in train stations.  I don't know, that is just the vibe I get.  Don't get me wrong, I liked it. \n\nThe service was great, but I think I will only be back for drinks and maybe an appetizer.  The food is really nothing special and I think I'd rather go to AZ88.  The only menu items I've tried are from the sandwich section, so it could be that I need to give Hanny's another shot.  I would like to try the pizza, but didn't on this visit because I swear I'd had pizza three times that week.  I was starting to feel like a college student again.  The delivery guy even said something like, \"You sure do like pizza.  I've been here a lot lately.\"  Hey, don't judge me.
