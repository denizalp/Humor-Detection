As I mentioned in my review of Cafe Phipps, our guys all went off to the Pennsylvania Trolley Museum for its holiday festival.  So we girls (me, my mom, my sister-in-law, and my niece) headed over to the Phipps Conservatory for brunch and a girls' afternoon out.  While the boys were admiring things with rails, electric motors, and steel wheels, we were having a fine brunch and enjoying botanical and horticultural displays.\n\nWe saw the Annual Winter Flower Show featuring snowmen made of white garden flowers, a 24 foot Christmas tree in the Victoria Room, smaller Christmas trees lit by LED lighting, and poinsetta creations throughout the exhibit.  And the new Headwaters of the Amazon exhibit shows the ecosystems and cultures of the rainforest.  The exhibit includes waterfalls, and fauna and flora from Peru and Brazil.  \n\nMakes me glad I'm not allergic to pollen!  \n\nBut we had a terrific females only day out.  And should I tell my husband Railfan Rick about the garden railroad?  Shall I tell him about the many G-scale trains they have operating at once?  Or about the world's only N-scale garden railroad running alongside?  Nah!
