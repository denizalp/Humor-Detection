Ok I have been here Four times now. The bagels are good.  But all four times they were out of something (and I don't mind running out of bagels, they only make so many, but tomatoes?) And 3 of the 4 visits the coffee was luke warm.  When all you sell is coffee and bagels.  Here is a tip. Have bagels and hot coffee!  This is an easy fix whoever is running this place.
