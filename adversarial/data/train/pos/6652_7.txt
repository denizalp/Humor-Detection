This is my first negative review on Yelp but I had a really disappointing experience here.\n\nI've heard so much hype from Toronto friends and maybe the Toronto locations are better run but I was totally underwhelmed and a little grossed out here.\n\nSo the food is EXPENSIVE. And I don't mind spending many dollar bills on good food. But this was expensive for TINY portions of completely greasy food in a dirty restaurant that had zero maintenance cleaning-wise that I could see because it looked like it had been a few hours since anyone swept the floors or cleaned the tables.\n\nAnd there were several hairs in my food. Which is SOOOO NASTY. Come on! I've worked in food service and it's not hard to put on a hair net for your shift underneath your hat.\n\nNeedless to say based on the price and the portion size I would expect flawless service and restaurant cleanliness but nope!\n\nSorry Burger's Priest but you have to step up your game. \n\nPS if you want a REAL burger with way more fun flavors and combinations go to Holy Chuck's! Clean restaurant and 5 star quality meat and toppings. And no I don't work for them but I have to suggest a better option for anyone reading this.
