Olive it is a fairly new business on Main St Unionville but they have another location in Whitby that has been successful for some time.\nThe store in question on Main St has fantastic staff, they are personable, genuinely nice, friendly people and they love to talk about the product. They will gladly have you taste each and every oil and vinegar they carry, but you most likely won't need to because they make great suggestions based on what flavours you like.\nThe best part is the product. The vinegar and oil flavours are super rich and indulgent, and can turn any dish or just simple salad greens into something extraordinary.  I highly recommend the Wild Mushroom and Sage olive oil and the Espresso vinegar. They are both great in salads, but just add little of the Wild Mushroom and Thyme olive oil to your pan before frying an omelet, or in a risotto, sit back and enjoy the compliments.  And then of course shoot me a thank you email for elevating you to gourmet chef status overnight. Also for those interested, I have an awesome homemade Espresso BBQ Sauce recipe that uses the Espresso Vinegar to create the smokiest, deepest and richest BBQ flavour you'll ever taste. So what are you waiting for? Go buy some!
