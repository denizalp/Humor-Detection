Not sure where to put this review, because the physical outlet might be fine,  but worst ever online service . I dont recommend using their online store... it takes day and days to get shoes (even if you pay express) because they send \"orders\" to stores and wait for them to respond. 5 days for them to let me know they weren't shipping it and I paid for express (1-2 day ) service. They did the same thing to me twice! Hey Softmoc, if you want to be in the online business there has to be a better way of managing your inventory
