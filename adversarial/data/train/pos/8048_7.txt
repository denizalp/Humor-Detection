On 6\/17\/16 my wonderful partner and I got married in beautiful Las Vegas. We wanted our friends to have an unforgettable dining experience so I booked reservations for an 8PM dining via Open Table back in March. This was my post ceremony celebration so of course I wanted everything to go smoothly. Unfortunately that did not happen. Please keep in the mind the 1 star is a reflection of the treatment my party and I received prior to being seated. The food, the view, and our server Brian was amazing! \n\nWe were finishing up our photo shoot on the strip when we arrived about 8:10PM to my party sitting in a small corner across from the hostess desk. I asked them why weren't they seated and was informed by one of my friends that our reservation was for 9pm. Ummm no it's not. It has always been 8PM. I go to the desk and the African-American hostess with brownish hair RUDELY says your reservation is for 9pm you have to wait and pointed us back to the corner. #1 You DO NOT speak to anyone that way, #2 NO ONE PUTS ME IN A CORNER! I explained to her that our reservations were confirmed today and have always been 8pm. She rolls her eyes and the Caucasian hostess with jet black hair next to her gives me dirty looks. At this point I ask for their manager to find out who changed my reservation and why. The manager arrives and says that our table is ready and we were able to be seated (so why were thing 1 and thing 2 giving my group such a hard time?) and he said employee #151 messed up the reservations in Open Table. \n\nJust based on that treatment alone, I do not recommend anyone to dine here. The elevator attendants and hostess all hate their jobs and it shows. You are the first impression of the restaurant and this is what people get? Unacceptable! They need to fire them all and get some fresh, happy faces in there.
