NYE DINNER PARTY - spent  $95  per person to have a meal that you'd pay less than $20 for. . Sure, the place is trendy,  crowd was good and everything else was less than mediocre. They really tried to sell their bottle service to everyone starting at $695.  So if you're like me with four people we had spent  $400 --on dinner, $100 bottle of wine and bottles of sparkling water and our bill was already at $700 plus tip.  If we wanted to keep the small table we had to shell out another  $700? Talk about taking advantage of your patrons. Once you had our dinner money,  you guys pretty much said now beat it and let us make more money. Now If the food was off the charts and the service had been white glove, then I can  see why there would be a premium,  but this was just annoying and unacceptable. \nSo all in all, this will be the last visit to your place and I'll be making sure that none of my friends and co-workers will be dining there anytime soon!  \nHappy new year!
