This review is for their BBQ To-Go deli. I've ordered the bbq pork char siu and also the roast duck. The original owners were helping chop up my meat into slices and it reminded me of Cantonese places in SF Chinatown.  \n\nThe meat flavors are always on point and more fresh than other places I've  ordered from. Order the BBQ meats and you won't be dissapointed. When I don't  feel like cooking this place is good to spot to get to go.  Don't  forget to ask for sauces with your order.  Best of all they a credit card friendly.
