I've never written a review here yet I go here all the time, since it is close to my house.\n\nWhen I gamble, I come here, and I go to the buffet once a week, sometimes twice.  It is easy to get comped if you play semi-regularly and to rack up points to get free stuff.  And their monthly mailers have lots of free alcohol (wine, beer, sometimes hard liquor like tequila and rum).\n\nI also usually go to the deli occasionally, and to the 32 degree bar for their great selection of beers.  They have Sin City Hefeweisen, which is one of my favorites.\n\nHowever, my only real complaint is that it is too expensive to do a \"staycation\" there.  When other hotels in down give heavy discounts, the M seems to market their hotel rooms mainly to out of towners, especially drivers from California.
