DO NOT GO HERE!!!   Their service is horrible.  They had my scooter for over a month, when it was finally fixed they called and I still had to wait another week for them to get an ok for it to be covered under the warranty.  When I picked it up, panels did not match up, it was dirty as hell, they spilled some type of oil on the seat and down the side of it and also the back wheel was covered in some sort of oil.  I will NEVER go back.  They do not even deserve 1 star.
