For a year, I passed by Pho Thanh every day on my way to work. For a year, I never thought once to step inside. For a year, I had no idea how much I was missing out! \n\nThis visit was a visit of firsts. My first time at this restaurant and my first time eating Vietnamese food. Both were spectacular! This restaurant isn't much to look at on the outside, but it's got everything it needs on the inside including friendly staff, cheap prices and delicious dishes. \n\nI will admit that the menu is completely overwhelming for a newbie like me. I had no idea what I wanted, but luckily I was dining with pros so they guided me in the right direction. I started with the spring rolls and opted for a pork bun. The spring rolls were really refreshing and I enjoyed the peanut sauce to accompany it. I wasn't a huge fan of the basil and\/or cilantro that came inside, so next time I would ask for them to leave the herbs out. The bun was delicious and huge! I snuck some of my remaining peanut sauce in there and poured in the sauce that came with it. I had no idea that it was fish sauce but I'm glad I didn't because I gave it a chance and really liked it! The bun had pork, noodles and eggs rolls. I only ate about half of it and was completely stuffed but not in a bad way. It was the perfect amount of food with the right spices and heartiness. As I enjoyed my meal and company, I looked around and noticed how crowded this place gets with every walk of life!\n\nGuess how much my bill was for spring rolls, bun and a diet coke? Around $8-$10. I'm serious! For the price alone, I will return, but for the food and friendly service, I will return sooner.
