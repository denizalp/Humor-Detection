I've been looking to get rid of (unfortunately) this beautiful ring from an ex of mine for quite a while now but every time I have brought it somewhere I felt like they weren't giving me a fair price and honestly I felt taken advantage of.\n\nSo there the ring sat hidden away in my closet until a friend at work recommended I give this place a shot.\n\nShe had sold jewelry there and coming from another woman I felt I at least needed to give them a chance.\n\nI brought my ring in and was blown away by how professionally and courteously they treated me. Every one I spoke to was kind, helpful, and truly knowledgeable. \n\nThey offered me more than a decent price for that ring and now instead of holding on to a beautiful piece of jewelry that gave me nothing but bad memories I have a little extra cash to spoil myself!\n\nThanks guys!
