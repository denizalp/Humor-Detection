I finally returned after my first visit - I was intrigued by the yuzu offerings and also these new tasting menus.\n\nToday the tasting menu looked amazing (first course - choice or battera or mackerel escabeche - saba all the way), tempura or some other yummy second course, choice of hot udon with beef or shrimp, and pineapple ice with coconut ice cream.  However, I wanted non-noodles tonight.\n\nI ordered the nasu agedashi that I had the first time and it was slightly different.  Noticeably, the ikura replaced the delicious lemon peel.\n\nNext, I enjoyed the 6 piece battera, mackerel with kelp.  Delicious and perfect.\n\nMy indulgence was the special of the night, a sashimi plate with tuna, salmon and hamachi.  It was served in a bowl of ice, with a thin slice of radish holding the wasabi, tuna resting on shiso leaf atop shredded daikon and carrot, folds of salmon and slices of hamachi, with one sweet shrimp with tail on standing up.  I really loved the presentation of the sashimi plate.\n\nMy yuzu tastes included the yuzu-limeade (refreshing, hint of yuzu) and the yuzu yogurt sorbet (too much honey on top, did not like the pop rocks, and the flavor of the sorbet was a bit odd to me too...masking the yuzu - served with blackberries on the side) but it was worth trying since I like to taste all things yuzu that I can find.  There are other places in town advertising yuzu desserts, so I hope I can get around to those eventually.\n\nOverall, still the same Beatles muzak in the background, playing for 7 months already?  Very nice service, great atmosphere, tempting menu.  I want to return for a tasting menu soon!
