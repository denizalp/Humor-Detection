Yummy Candies To Please The Child In Us In Las Vegas\n\nSITREP\n\nIn a way, I feel like I've walked into a part of Willy Wonka's Chocolate Factory Operation, because that is what Fuzziwig's Candy Factory aimes for.  \n\nSETUP\n\nAt it's core, Fuzziwig's is a self-serve candy store that is in fact designed to look like a whimsical candy factory.   The store is decorated with animated candy-making machines, creating a lively atmosphere of candy-fun. \n\nTHE CANDIES\n\nThere are in fact over 400 catalogued varieties of candies, including old school jaw breakers, rock candy, candy necklaces, wax lips, pixie stiks, etc. etc., all displayed in baskets and bins.  For me, there is very reminiscent of Candy Heaven in Old Sacramento with a very similar set-up.  \n\nOTHER ITEMS\n\nFuzziwig's also had an impressive collection of plush toys and animals, and other kinds of collectibles, making Fuzziwig's a \"go-to\" place for fun items.\n\nSTICKER-SHOCK\n\nThe price of candy in this store is pretty high - anywhere from $10-$13 a pound for some kinds of candy.  So it is important that you shop around and get the truly unique special items here.  But M&Ms?  I'd say go to Target or Walmart cause you're gonna pay 3-4 times as much here.\n\nTHE LOWDOWN\n\nFuzziwigs is a great stop for fun in Las Vegas, especially if you have the kids with you, but more of a once-in-a-while-treat, and probably not where you are going to find affordable bulk candy purchases.
