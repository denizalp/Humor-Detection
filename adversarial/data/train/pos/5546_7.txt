Meet Fresh is a Taiwanese dessert restaurant that has now expanded to Toronto!  I remember hearing about the news sometime last year when Sweven Media was working on bringing them here.\n\nThis past weekend (Jan 19, 20, and 21), Meet Fresh had their opening weekend.  In celebration of that, they had a \"Free Q Mochi Giveaway\" with this msg:  \"As appreciation for your patience and interest, we want to give you free Q Mochi!  The first 300 customers to arrive on the opening weekend (Friday, Saturday and Sunday) will be given a Q Mochi set (8 pieces) for free on each day!  We open our doors at 11 am, so make sure to come early to get yours!\"\n\nI received that promo e-mail in my inbox from Sweven Media.\n\nMy bf also alerted me to this giveaway because there was a Facebook event where the title of the event was \"300 Free Q Mochi Sets each day, Meet Fresh Soft Opening\".  \n\nSo anyone reading these words would think that upon lining up at 11 am, the proposed Q Mochi Set would be free; right?  It only made sense that if you lined up that early in anticipation for their event that the mochi set would be free.  As a PR company or restaurant promoting itself, giving free items to campaign and hype themselves is a smart marketing idea.  When something is given for free, you have willing happy people who are going to line up for hours and provide free promotion for you.  It's win-win for both parties.\n\nThus, we arrived on Sunday, Jan 21 at exactly at 11 am where there was already a small line-up of about 10 to 15 people in line.  Once we queued ourselves up at the end of the line, the doors opened and everyone was able to go in.  \n\nThere was a menu of the items above the cashier and the line seemed to move slowly.  We overheard someone in the front of the line say that apparently the mochi sets weren't free but that they were free with purchase.  What?!  I thought this was a free giveaway.  ...  We were fine to purchase an item and receive the free mochi set since we were already there, but I immediately felt deceived and slighted by the campaign.\n\nI knew the contact person for SM and messaged him right away to inquire.  He confirmed with me a few minutes later that indeed the \"free mochi set\" was only given if you made a purchase.  Thus, that's why they had deliberately used the word \"customer\" in their promotion. ...\n\nI felt this was a very sneaky and deceptive marketing ploy and took advantage of people's inattentiveness by using the word \"customer\" and \"free\" in the same campaign and being vague about the giveaway criteria.  If it was the case that the mochi set wasn't going to be given for free (where the definition of \"free\" = no purchase), they should have stated in their campaign, \"BUY ONE GET ONE FREE\" instead.  That's what the campaign really was, NOT a free item.  It's so tacky to use just one word in the campaign to mislead their followers like that.  It's not right.\n\nIt gives a bad impression of MF before people even try the product.  It angers the consumer who shows up because they feel deceived.  I know I was and so was another friend who I ran into who was there as well.  Don't say something is \"free\" unless and until you actually don't have to pay to receive it.  Shame on you, MF and SM.\n\nAnyway, it took a while (20 mins) to get to the front of the line to make an order with the cashier.  There was only one cashier which was why the line took so long to move up.\n\nWe ended up ordering the Meet Fresh Signature in order to receive the \"free mochi set\".  Ugh.\n\nAfter placing the order, the cashier asked if we wanted the order to-go or to dine in.  I wanted to dine in.  The cashier told us to take a beeper and then head upstairs to the dining room to wait for our order.  I thought it was a little confusing since it wasn't clear from entering the restaurant at first that they had a dining room at all.  We finally found the staircase that led to the upstairs dining room.  The dining room was clean and modern with lots of seating.\n\nThe Q Mochi Set came in 8 pcs.  Their menu doesn't actually explain what it is other than it is \"Q Mochi\".  We liked the lighter colour mochi more.  It was very chewy and soft and I was impressed with the quality of the mochi! \n\nThe Meet Fresh Signature contained pumpkin and taro mochi balls, grass jelly, and some shaved ice at at the bottom.  It wasn't until after we left and I had looked at some photos on social media that I realized that the staff completely forgot to give us the container of cream used to pour over the bowl when eating it.  Ugh.\n\nThe spherical mochi balls were chewy and not grainy.  However, the flavours of the pumpkin and taro weren't pronounced at all.  The grass jelly was good but didn't taste very fresh.  I've had better grass jelly and mochi balls before.
