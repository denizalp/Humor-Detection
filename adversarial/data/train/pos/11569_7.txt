This is a GEM!  Tucked away in a shopping center, most people would drive by without even considering going inside.  What a mistake! \nThis is a great place to get your traditional and authentic German foods.  They have a deli case full of German meats as well as some foods that are difficult to procure at a standard grocery store.\nThey offer a traditional dish each and every day in addition to their standard lunch menu consisting of various sandwiches.  \nThe owners are their daily and offer great customer service as well as friendly advice on the various products that they have to offer.  \nBy far the BEST value for the food that you get!
