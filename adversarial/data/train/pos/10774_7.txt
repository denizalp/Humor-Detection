Usually when I'm rollin' and smokin' somethin'...it ain't food. This place is worth rollin' into cause the food is smokin' good. The dudes that runs this place are extremely personable-servin' some heapin' helpings of hospitality along with their scrumptious offerings. Most everything I have had here is excellent. The highlight, as mentioned before is the Outlaw Burger, that thing hits the bull's-eye! I am especially fond of their jalape√±o slaw, a wonderful kick to that stuff. The potato salad is not one of my faves, a little too bland for me, but that said, it still has this delightful subtle flavor that I can see lots of folks digging, and honestly I would order it again. Great bark on the meats. The sauce at the tables...should you feel the need...offers a complex mix of flavors with a welcomed spicy kick. Most of the sides are prepared in house. One employee told me the fried okra is frozen, but I (and one of my friends) seriously thought it tasted fresh. They must have found a great supplier. This interior is not divey at all, though for some, the location is. Fresh brewed regular and sweet tea. Two separate dining areas with 2 different vibes. Holy smoke, Rollin' Smoke ain't no joke, I felt high driving home and didn't even toke.
