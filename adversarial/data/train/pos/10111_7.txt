This restaurant sucks! What? Was that too harsh? \n\nI am always on the lookout for new Thai places to try in Las Vegas. I was driving down Decatur and noticed their lunch special advertisement on the building. The next day, I made it a point to stop by and grab some lunch to go.\n \nFirst warning sign- The parking lot was empty, and so was the restaurant! I walked in and noticed that there was no greeting stand or host\/hostess up front. As a result, I was standing there like an idiot unsure of what to do to place an order. One of the ladies in the back yells across and says \"table for one\"?  I scream back \"No, I need to place an order to go\". She motions me over to have a seat and hands me a dirty menu. \n\nI decided on a dish that they couldn't possibly screw up--cashew chicken.  Ummm, Wrong! Rubbery chicken with no cashews was what I ended up with. The lunch portion came with a side of steamed rice and a mushy egg roll.  \n\nWhen it was time to pay for my $7.00 lunch, I handed the server my credit card.  She proceeds to tell me that my bill wasn't enough to use a credit card. Um ok--sorry that is all that I have right now. She didn't like my answer, and said something in a different language to another lady in the restaurant. She tells me that this time they will let me use a credit card. \"Wow-thank you for letting me pay you\". \n\nMy wife then reminds me after my awful experience that we hated this place 5 years ago. The food is garbage, and the service is worse.
