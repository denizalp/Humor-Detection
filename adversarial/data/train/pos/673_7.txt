OH MY GOSHHHHHH!!!!!\nI literally just came from Embassy\nDid I just die and go to heaven?\nYESSSSSSSSS!!!!!\n\n\nWhile dining in, my ol' friend and I, ordered: \n\nVEGGIE SAMOSAS- -5\/5- - SO GOOOOOD , and make sure you get the tamerin sauce too(plus we ordered 25 more for my family at the take-out part of embassy)\n\nBUTTER CHICKEN - - 5\/5 - - said..it had a little kick to it..the chicken was juicy\n\nMutter Paneer -  - 5\/5 - - and I thought Saravanaa Bhavan was the best!! This puts that to shame, haha.  It had the perfect amount of spice to it. PLUS, it was $4.99. HALF THE PRICE OF OTHER RESTAURANTS!!!!YET WAYYY BETTER!!!\n\nNaan - - 3\/5 -- This was the only downer. It wasn't horrible, yet it wasn't that delish. I wish it was more fluffier.\n\nRas Malaii -- 5\/5 -- *DROOOOOOOOL* ....it was so good, i had to go to the take-out section and order 5 more for home (yes, i'm a fatty =D)
