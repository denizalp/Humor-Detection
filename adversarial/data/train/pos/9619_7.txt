I'm slightly conflicted about this review because I really love the people that work here, especially the owner, so I will lay out the good and bad as I see things.\n\nGood:\n\n- Customer service. When my wife and I came in here for late night take out, they always offered free soft drinks and good conversation. I come from the school where service reigns above all else. That and a clean place, and they are on top of things in this department as well.\n\n- Hours are good, open late. That's a plus for second shift types like us. Closed Sunday, but it's the Sabbath(may be technically Saturday but whatever), I understand.\n\nBad:\n\n- Prices are high, which isn't really an issue, but the food has been a little inconsistent. Pizza is a bit heavy and soggy, but I like a thinner, NYC type so it could just be me. The calamari was way too salty. The pasta dishes I've had were pretty good, along with the sandwiches.\n\nHonestly, I haven't been here in a few months because of my schedule, so maybe some of the kinks have been ironed out. \n\nGeorge, if you're reading, get a thin crust pizza on the menu and tone down the salt a bit. Wife and I both wish you much prosperity.\n\nGoing to try and get back soon.
