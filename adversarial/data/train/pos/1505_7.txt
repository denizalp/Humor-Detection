Mmmmmmm!!!!! Chad, the cashier and griller, was personable, sweet, and engaging. He definitely enhanced the experience. Chad alone gets 5 stars!! Nothing makes the experience better than to have a genuinely friendly person right from The start of your visit! \n\nI got the chicken shawarma plate. Large portion and rich in taste. I felt bad because I saw Chad throw butter on the grill so I asked him to remake the chicken for me. And he gladly did it without one ounce of hesitation or remark. He did it with a happy smile. I will say that the food, even after the remake, didnt taste as clean as other places I've tried. But that's just my preference! I want to come back and try their other menu items because everything is made in house! \n\nThey even have an array of hot sauces; sriracha, tapatio etc...love that just because it caters to everyone. \n\nI do wish that the plate came with pita bread. And chicken could taste a bit cleaner. Other than that, GO CHAD!
