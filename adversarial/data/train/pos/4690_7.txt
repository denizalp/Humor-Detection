Two problems with this place.\n1. They use two menu's - one is for nights with an event (Coyotes etc) and the other is non event. The event menu has half the items the regular menu has including charging $17 for a Carne Asada burrito, while the normal price is 9 bucks. Sounds like they need new cooks because I do not recall Cheesecake Factory having that arrangement. It is just pure greed. They also jack up the beer prices as I paid over $5 for a Bud Light bottle. Go during a non event night if you don't want to get ripped off or better yet, go to another place named SALT that is not owned by someone from Seattle. \n\n2. This is a major Seattle Seahawks bar as evidenced by the green balloons and hundreds of supporters filling the bar two weeks ago before the Cardinals\/Seahags contest. This should not be occurring in the shadow of the Cardinals stadium, but this is par for the course in Arizona. Blame the Westgate owners for letting this occur and boycott this place (and Whisky Rose) if you support Big Red.\n\nP.S. Seahawks lost, so now what...you gonna put some red balloons up now?
