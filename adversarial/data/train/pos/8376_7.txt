Car\/dog\/clothing wash--all in one!  \n\nSo far I've only used the dog wash, which is cheaper than a groomer but keeps your home cleaner than the typical \"do it yourself\" method.  Magic offers two separate enclosed dog washing stations, and an employee will also offer to give your dog a treat.  Each dog wash station is in its own lockable room and includes shampoo, conditioner, water, and blow drying\/suction. Bring your own towels if you don't want to get it all done with the dryer. I was a complete novice to the concept and found it very easy to use.  The wall mounted unit allows you to switch between warm water and water mixed with shampoo or conditioner (different types are available.   You can also use the green space surrounding the building to walk your dog.\n\nThanks for showing me a better way than having a stinky dog, Magic Wash.
