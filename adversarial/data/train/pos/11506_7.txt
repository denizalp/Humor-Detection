As a traveler I always try to avoid big coffee house chains like Starbucks so I can experience different local flavor. Nothing wrong with Starbucks but I find it nice to support some of the other local businesses. Looking for an early morning fix I happen to come across Coffee Rush on my Yelp search. From the Yelp photos there seemed to be some outdoor seating with a view of a pond. Combine that with solid reviews I decided to give Coffee Rush a try.\n\nIt was only 10am but it was already too warm for a hot drink so I decided to roll with an iced mint mocha. Value and taste wise the drink was good and went well with the fresh baklava. The employees\/barristas were very friendly and offered me a punch card. I informed them that I was from out of town and they expressed their gratitude for trying Coffee Rush out.\n\nOverall a great experience at Coffee Rush. Good coffee, plenty of indoor and outdoor seating, free wifi, and a friendly staff made this coffee stop a nice alternative to Starbucks. Definitely a great place for out of towners looking to try something a little more local. Thanks Coffee Rush!
