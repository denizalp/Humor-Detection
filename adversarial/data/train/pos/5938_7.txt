I'm a cheese addict, and Giordano's pizza is an overdose of one of my favorite things! As if pizza couldn't get any better, the classic deep dish Chicago style pie is loaded up with a ridiculous amount of cheese and toppings. The only downside to this location is that it's on the Strip, which can be a hassle to get to at times but there are some great views from their second floor windows and bar area.\n\nThe apps and salads are fresh and fairly light to keep you ready for the pizza, which is the real reason you came here. Each pie takes a while, so go with a fun group (also helps with pricing). Staff were super friendly and will try their best to get the best cheese pull for your photos! So far I've tried the Chicago Classic (pepperoni, mushroom, peppers, onion) and the Super Veggie (mushroom, peppers, onion, broccoli, spinach, olive), and preferred the latter- the cheese was so overwhelming that the added meats weren't necessary. \n\nTIP: Park at Bally's\/Paris for closest free option for locals.
