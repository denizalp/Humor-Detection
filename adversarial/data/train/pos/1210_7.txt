Excellent service and nothing better than free tune ups for life. \n\nI came here around February to purchase a road bike as I wanted to get into road cycling for exercise. Chris helped me out and was extremely knowledgable in picking out a bike that fit my needs and my budget. He also took the time and patience to explain things to me (as I was completely new to road bikes) and answer all my questions. We probably spent over an hour going through different bikes and adjusting it to my needs. I really appreciated that help.\n\nSince then I've dropped by the shop to pick up some additional gear and once to ask about an issue I was with the bike. They showed me what the problem was, what caused it, and fixed it immediately. Their service is what keeps me coming back. \n\nAs mentioned above, when you buy a bike from the shop you get free tune ups for the life of the bike - which is obviously a great bonus. \n\nIf you at all feel intimidated about the bike culture, don't be. Just visit Oxygen and they'll guide you through everything and eventually you'll be riding away extremely pleased with your decision.
