This place has the makings of a 5-star favorite.  Happy Hour is Everyday 4-6pm Weedays, but you get an extra Hour on Sat\/Sun when the hours are 3-6pm... All of their Southern Cocktails are on HH.  Most of the small plates are, Beers and wines... and I think the prices are pretty decent too. \n\nI stopped in on a Saturday around 5:30 after reading Taric's review.  And yes, this place is everything the folks are saying about it and more.  I already know that I'm going back.  I want to try a few more things on the menu.\n\nSo far, \nI've had the chicken skins..  Honestly absolutely delightfully tasty... The crispy skin and the sweet and spicy drizzled honey sauce pairs well with their Okra Hot sauce.  (just be careful pouring the sauce out of that bottle... it has a wide mouth and you'll have a plate full of sauce)\n\nI also ordered the Tennessee style fried chicken.  A leg and a thigh.  I was not quite a impressed with this as I was the chicken skins.  The chicken wasn't seasoned well enough and to me, Tennessee hot style chicken (like Gus') is not wet, its actually dry.  Nevertheless, the chicken was still very tasty and I would have it again, but request the sauce on the side.\n\nNo time soon, there are things on that menu that I must try...Here's a todo list:\nChicken Skins: 5\/5\nTennessee Fried Chicken: 3\/5\nBeef brasato: 5\/5 \nPork Belly Bites and Greens\nPimento Cheese Burger\nHamhock and blackeyed peas\nBonemarro biscuits and stuff\npotlickker mussels\nOysters al forno....
