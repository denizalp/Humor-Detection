I've had nearly everything on their menu. I don't find their food that great, nevertheless I've been here hundreds of times because it's close to my workplace and they serve food fast. Their bubble teas are nice. \n\nThey have fairly big portions, but the good is greasy. I end up getting their braised chicken over rice, which comes with two large pieces of chicken, and egg, and some rice. Their fish fillet over rice is also among the nicer dishes. I try to avoid their pork dishes since I don't think they are of very good quality. I ended up having tummy issues after eating those twice. \n\nThey have some of the rudest service I have ever seen. I have seen their cashiers and servers change over time, but the one things that hasn't changed is their attitude.
