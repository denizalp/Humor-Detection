I am a fan of costco.  I like their Kirkland brand.  I love the optical dept.  Just got a pair of long distance glasses with all the coatings - my eyes glaze over when they start talking about the coatings - and paid $128.  That is remarkable!!  I've paid $400 to $500 in the past.  \n\nWe especially like the Cambazola cheese, the Kirkland Pulled Pork, the fresh halibut (when they have it in), Kirkland nuts etc etc.\n\nThe store is always clean and there are of course 'the samples'.  You could eat a lunch as you wend your way through the aisles.  \n\nPersonnel are friendly and good at keeping the sometimes long lines at the checkout moving.
