Not really sure if I love this location.... I mean, it's ok. The employees that work here are nice enough, and they are helpful. But... I don't know. I still just think the Mandalay Place location is soooo much better.\n\nThe store here is really small, and the girls working were nice to me, but I was the only one in the store at the time. If it was the Mandalay one, they would have been all over me, trying to give me hand massages and offering to do a custom facial! The customer attention here was just not at the same level.\n\nOne of the girls working showed me to the bath bomb area, told me about the new Halloween-themed version they had, then bagged it for me. But after that, she just walked back behind the counter to finish talking to the other girl. I wandered the store for a while, then asked for a sample. They gave me the world's most stingy sample!! The other location always gives me the bigger plastic ones and they fill them all the way or at least close to the top.\n\nOverall, this one is alright, but that's about it.
