Food is good. Definitely conveniently located for me. I ordered takeout and the food arrived literally piping hot. I ordered the Egg Drop Soup. It was seriously so hot. I had to let it cool before I could eat it. That's impressive for takeout. It's your typical egg drop soup. I also ordered chicken fried rice and Kung Pao chicken. All the food was good.... Nothing amazing, but definitely good Chinese food. Portion size is also pretty good. You definitely get your money's worth.
