I love the Girl Scouts and what they stand for.  I came to the office to go to the shop.  I was greeted in a friendly manner and showed where the Daisy items were.  After reviewing my items, the associate asked if there wasn't another item I needed.  She was right.  I looked around for a little bit and adored all the cute items.  Bought my Daisy a little necklace.  Check was fast and simple.
