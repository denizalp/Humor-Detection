The worst experience I have ever had with a leasing company.  My fiance and I were attempting to rent an apartment from Mozart.  Despite the fact that we will be married, have employment, and have great credit, Mozart insisted on having co-signers for our lease.  Not just one cosigner, they insisted in having both sets of our parents (4 parents in total) co-sign the lease.  That is 6 people co-signing the lease of 2 adults in their 30s who have great credit and employment.  To add insult to injury they also insisted on charging $10\/consign. It seemed like a ploy to squeeze as much money out of us as possible. I was so shocked and offended by this that I asked to talk to the manager.\n\nThe manager proceeded to basically laugh at my fiance and I when we insisted in seeing this policy in writing.  She stated that they had no obligation to show us anything.  Meanwhile they were asking for us to sign away many rights. She was so rude and unapologetic, she acted like she was doing us a favor by even answering our questions.  \n\nThen we read the lease carefully.  Honesty, I don't think it is legal to have this type of lease.  Basically they state that they can enter the apartment at any time without any notice for any reason.  How can that possibly be appropriate?  They also insist that you renew your lease within 6 mos of the new lease or else they will begin showing the apartment without any notice to you.  Horrible and completely invasive.\n\nI have had rectal exams that were more comfortable than this experience.  DO NOT RENT FROM MOZART.  There are plenty of other companies and privately owned properties who are far better to lease from.  The apartment we looked at was nice, but no where near nice enough to go through this mess.  I will tell everyone I know to stay away from them.
