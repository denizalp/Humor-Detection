Review 112, where the players dwell. I chose a casino to review, just so I could use that line. LOL!\n\nI think Santa Fe is a great local casino & I enjoy coming here from time to time. Usually to watch a movie or bring out of town guests to gamble, as well as the occasional bowling outing. Every now & again I will hit the buffet or the Grand Cafe. Im not a huge gambler, so I'm rarely in here for that. Although, I do love me some Caveman Keno ;) Another huge plus is that I live within walking distance.
