I was pleasantly surprised to realized The Pie Commission was a purveyor of savory pies, kind of like pot pies but with a gourmet twist. \n\nKris U took me here for an afternoon lunch and while we did sit inside and eat there we wouldn't have been able to do so if anyone else had been in the place because there were only about 3 stools at a counter. They do an awesome to-go business where you can even buy the pies in bulk and that definitely seems to be the focus.\n\nI chose the Chicken Cheddar Bacon Mash pie which had roasted garlic cheesy bacon mashed potatoes stuff inside a beautifully flaky pastry shell. It was quite filling and came in an adorable little brown box. I was also able to get a simple green salad on the side.\n\nIt's easy to see why the place is so popular - the food is fast and delicious and with an interesting take on an old comfort food item.
