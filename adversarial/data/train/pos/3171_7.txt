i got tattooed here while visiting a friend in summer 2005. by corey, i think.\n\na year and a half later i'm still extremely pleased. the color has held wonderfully, and corey (sorry, if i got your name wrong! it's been a while) was awesome in general. he gave me tons of extra shading for only $100. with the time i spent in his chair it should have cost quite a bit more.\n\ni'm always getting compliments on the quality of my tattoo, in fact, this place has sort of spoiled me for others. i'm worried that i won't like my next tattoo near as much.\n\n5 stars for the tattoo itself, but minus one star because i saw a flash on the wall that was misspelled, and that's just wrong.
