Novelty Shoe Rebuilders is renowned for it's excellence in shoe repair. They are the go-to guys for Daks and Harry Rosen's, who send all of their customers there. They can do re-soles for goodyear welted shoes (basically most men's shoes more than $200) plus do a thriving business in women's heel repair. They also do an excellent job with topy's and have a large selection of shoe polishes and accessories. Probably the only place in the GTA that carries Lincoln shoe polish, the shoe polish of the USMC. Check it out at lunchtime and it's busy....compared to the other shoe places in DT Toronto.
