this place was a disappointment...\n\ni mean u always pass this place while drivin down the strip and u see the gang of people hangin out on the balcony and they seem like they are having a blast.\nso as one of our main stops on our bar run this place was MEhhhh....\nwe had to toss our drinks before headin in...so our boys downed their beers. we show ID.. get in and the place is biiiiig, they had live music but it wasnt that great that nite, they have ONE type of margarita for all i could tell and no hugeeeee long cups...hello i thot they would have it? and shutup up i AM a tourist...psh\n\nso after a few tiny cups of beers we left and continued our journey because it wasnt worth staying...
