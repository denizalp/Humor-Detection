I've put off this review for so long that I'm just gonna spit it out. \n\nHolly's classes give me crazy renewed energy, mental rejuvenation, with the added bonus of inspiring the crap outta me. She makes me feel like I can move mountains. \n\nIf I lived closer, I'd be standing at her door every day I had available screaming \"TAKE MY MONEY\". \n\nAlso, they have really clean bathrooms with showers and towels, along with blowdryers and tampons and throwaway razors... just in case. They give you fresh fruit and filtered water. It's a pretty sweet setup, really. But, most importantly, they have Holly. So go. Go get fit and have fun.
