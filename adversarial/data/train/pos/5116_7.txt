It was probably a nice restaurant twenty some years ago: the locale is a converted pretty Victorian with stain-glass windows; the bar area displays a disused grand piano propping up bottles of wine; the dining room still sports a pastel palette of sea foam and salmon; and framed 80's posters of the same color scheme grace the walls. \n\nThe menu is marginally more updated than the decor. Some dishes remind me of food fads from the 90's (e.g., the chef seems to have a penchant for meat and fruit pairing). Overall, the menu is too long and rambling without a theme, covering everything from the Baja to the Mediterranean. \n\nThe food was unremarkable. The bread tasted like a generic supermarket baguette; it was served with olive oil and powdery parm (i.e., from the green can). For appetizers, we ordered the prosciutto and figs as well as the trout and peaches. They were probably the highlight of the meal, but the portions were tiny, and the ingredients were not the best. For the main course, I tried their fish taco, which was on the bland and dry side. \n\nSummary: if you are ever nostalgic for \"fine dining in a small American town during the 80's,\" this place is for you.
