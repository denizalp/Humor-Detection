Kay and I made a return visit  to Sushi Kim not long ago, and I must say that my 4 star rating has not wavered. I continue to find their food to be solidly appetizing. \n\nThe Pork Bulgogi is a scrumptiously smoldering heap of marinated pig and vegetables, its warm spice gently nibbling at your tongue, its sesame seed garnish adding welcome but slight crunchy textures. \n\nConsidering our boredom with sushi, we opted for the shumai as our appetizer. 6 quivering corks of steamed potsticker dough contained within them chopped shrimp. While flavorsome enough plain, the filling lacked seasoning, thereby giving purpose to the glass bottles of Asian condiments on our table. \n\nService-wise, there were no faux pas made. \n\nIs the bulb in my noggin dim...for being favorable towards Sushi Kim? \n\nEh, who cares what you think? \n\nI kid They Who Rant And Whine For The Sake Of It. \n\nP.S. As I mentioned in my initial review, I thought their sushi was merely adequate in spite of their namesake (misnomer?). Stick with SK's hot Korean selections, and your meal may prove more enjoyable.
