Made an appointment for a design and quote. The morning of the appointment Jake called and said he was \"sick\". Reset appointment for the following Saturday and this time he didn't even have the courtesy to call and cancel or reset the appointment. Needless to say we won't be using Caribbean Pools. If this the kind of service we get before a contract is written I don't want to know what it would be like after they get paid
