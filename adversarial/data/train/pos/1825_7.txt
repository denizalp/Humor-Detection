This place was so perfectly seedy. I absolutely loved it.\n\nIt smelled like every pool hall I've ever been to. Musty, stale cigarettes, slight smell of beer. It's in the same strip mall as the Green Door, Entourage, Lotus, Namaste... very dive-y area, but the place was great.\n\nI had a Newcastle draft for $3.50; reasonable. Pool games were a buck a pop. The pop a shot basketball arcade game didn't work correctly. The guy who collected the balls when we were leaving looked like his eyes were molded half shut because of all the weed he's smoked in his life.\n\nThere was something for everyone here. Snooker tables, regulation size pool tables, smaller bar pool tables. When I was younger, I used to go to pool halls every Thursday and Friday night with my high school crew. We'd hustle, gamble, eat wings, drink beer, and just have a great time. Going to pool halls like this is a real throwback to my younger days when I was a little bit of a seedy hoodlum myself. Memories!\n\nTangentially, the bartender's boobs were popping out of her undersized tanktop. I mean, I couldn't stare at her face. Those things must have been quadruple F's. FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF. She wasn't even pretty. At least, I don't think she was pretty. Her boobs were like a car accident. I didn't want to look, but I couldn't tear my eyes away. So big.\n\nI'll be back, but only for the pool. Not for the bartender's tatas. I swear. Way too big for anyone's taste.
