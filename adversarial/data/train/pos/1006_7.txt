Wow, why has it taken me nearly 2 years to find this place??? I am a huge fan of pizza, but don't really care for a mediocre pie. Luisa's is as good as it gets. Granted, I have only had take-out from here so I can't comment on the service, but this is a perfect mix of New York style and brick oven -  delicious thin crust, corn meal on the bottom, whole milk mozzarella...delish. Our pizza had pepperoni, onions, and olives. I was surprised (and admittedly apprehensive) to see red onions when I opened the box, but they were delicious and probably even better than white onions.\n\nNext time we order pizza, it will ABSOLUTELY be from Luisa's!
