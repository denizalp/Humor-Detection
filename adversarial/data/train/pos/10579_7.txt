I was at this location with my two daughters. While inside they had a Dogue de Bordeaux puppy in the \"pit\". My 2 year old went to lean over to look at it while it jumped up to look over this pit and her eye was scratched. Not one employee came over to male sure she was okay or check on us. This cut bled a little. I asked for an incident report and they acted like I was at fault. I understand these things can and do happen but have the decency and training to check to make sure that people are okay if a puppy scratches them. I wrote to the district off and they called and spoke with me. I would not trust this staff as they are only mindless droids and are not concerned with proper procedures when incidents happen. Some training would be helpful.
