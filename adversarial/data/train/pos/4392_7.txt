PH towers Westgate was really nice IMO.\nUnfortunately it took forever and a day to get my room but it was definitely worth it in the end. I arrived extremely early due to my flight being crazy early in the morning... so I had to wait many hours, but I couldn't blame them since their check in time IS at 4. Luckily the room was ready by 1PM. We had the TWO BEDROOM SUITE high floors and had 9 people. It fit us all pretty well. I probably wouldn't do more than 10 in the overall suite. What I was a little bummed about is that when I made the reservations WAY IN ADVANCE, I was promised two pullouts.. when we got into the room we only noticed one. I called and they offered me a roll away bed.. that was fine, so we took it.\n\nThe room itself was a really good deal.... especially for the summer.. and the it's pretty spacious and comfty.\n\nThe kitchen came in handy to make ramen noodles and stuff lol, oh and the water from the fridge saved ALL of our lives and our wallets too.\n\nSweet views, comfortable beds and spacious. PH towers is pretty awesome and I wouldn't mind staying here again in the future.
