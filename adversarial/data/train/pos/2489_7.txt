Stopped in for lunch for the first time. I was in a hurry but didn't want fast food. The staff was super friendly and helped guide me to order. They give you a buzzer for when your food is ready. Food was fairly quick. \n\nI got the char-burger with cheese with a side of sweet potato fries. The burger had a ton of flavor and was juicy. The grilled onions were a delicious addition. But the sweet potato fries....... holy moly..... INCREDIBLE! best sweet potato fries I have had. So delicious! \n\nThey also had some good drink options. I got a fresh squeezed strawberry kiwi juice that was very refreshing and tasty. Was a great mix to wash down all the food I shoved down since it was so TASTY! \n\nOverall everything was super good and I can't wait to come back and take my husband and try more things. Thanks so much!
