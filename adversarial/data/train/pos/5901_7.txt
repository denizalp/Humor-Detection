I have been twice, both time the food was better than I expected.\nIt is a perfect place for giant portions of comfort food! Not a good place for a diet, but sometimes I just want a big plate of tasty \"I Don't give a F\" dinner. Hopefully fried!\n\nThe interior feels like you are in Tahoe to me.\nIt has that rustic, expansive feel to it. The service has been completely fine both times.\nVery efficient, and on point. Not necessarily that friendly, but that is OK. I am not there to make friends. \n\nWould I go back, probably. The fact that I can walk to it from my house is part of that probability. Would I drive across town for it...doubtful.
