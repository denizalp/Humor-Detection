I was over in Denver having my Audi serviced and since my wife was going with friends to a show at the Belk Theater, decided to have dinner before going home. Checked out the scene and found that Homestread Grill had opened down the street on my way.  I suspect that this is owned by the same people who owned Homestead in Lincolnton and the hostess things so also. I enjoyed the others and looked forward to this one two.\n\nThis place is in a small strip mall on Hwy 16 just north of the interscetion with North Pilot Rd.  Used to be a Japanese Restaurant but now is more American with a Carribbean touch.  When they take you back to your table, the back wall has a map of Hurrican Andrew in 1992 which almost wiped out Homestead Florida hence the name.\n\nInside decor is dark wood with low lights so I guess you could describe it as romantic but at my age, I would describe it as hard to read the menu\n\nHostess was very nice as were the servers. Promptly seated and drink orders taken although there was a bit of delay in getting my Sweet Tea.\n\nGood menu with many selections but I zeroed in on one of my favorites which is a Shrimp Po Boy.  Afterall, I did not make to New Orleans and Marti Gras this week so this was a step in the right direction.\n\nThis is as close to a real NOLA Shrimp Po Boy and I have found in the area and the portions are hugh. The Remoulade Sauce was excellent with just the right amount of heat.  For a side I had the Fried Loaded Mashed Potatoes not really knowing what I was going to get. Turned out to be a very flavorful Croquette.\n\nTurned out to be a very nice dinner and next time, if she is not going to the Belk, will have to bring my wife as well.
