There are only a few Front Row Sports stores in Vegas.  This happens to be the one located nearest to my home.  Located at the Meadows Mall, there is easy access to this store if you park on the North side of the Mall which has you enter and exit on the 2nd floor.\n\nThis is one of my \"go to\" spots for Football Jerseys.  Last year I bought a USC Jersey (Grad School) and this past weekend I bought a UNLV Jersey (Undergrad).  Their selection of Jerseys is large and they carry unique items at this location that the others don't.  For example, last year this location was the only one that had a USC Football Jersey.  This weekend, while I was purchasing the UNLV Jersey the guy pointed out a USC dry-fit shirt that they just got in and said they were the only store to carry it.  So.....I bought it!  Dammit, I hate when that happens.....sales guy did his job!\n\nThere were a ton of other stuff too....they just got in the new Lakers gear, but I had to get out before I started spending too much money.  I love my sports teams and can easily get caught up with all the merchandise.  I paid quickly and ran out to my car.\n\nWill I return?  Most likely.
