This place does not just have the best ice cream but it is also a full service Green Mountain Coffee Shop! I did not know this! It was free cone day I did not take any pics shame on me, I know right. This location is under new ownership and forgive me I cant recall the owner's name but she was super nice, her family run's it and I got the \"inside scoop\" on the place hehe. She even let the old man sample the coffee and go back for another scoop! They have a sitting area for kid's complete with tv and they play Disney movies! Score! \n\nI am not a coffee drinker but if I was I'd buy Green Mountain they have Fair Trade & Organic blend's they make diff ones for diff causes and charities I think thats great. I got my little B & J keytag and I will deffinately be back lot's.
