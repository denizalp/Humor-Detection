What an awesome addition to the already long list of things to do in Vegas! We were here for a work trip and it beats having a boring sit-down company dinner. Great way to hang out, play some friendly (and competitive!) rounds of golf, drink and eat.\n\nThere are three levels here and the third level has a swimming pool. The entire floor was booked for a private event so I haven't seen it myself, but how dope does that sound? Also, our hostess informed us that it can get very busy with a 4-hr wait here, but luckily, we were seated right away.\n\nIt's set at an hourly rate and each person gets a membership card. There are golf clubs for both men and women and a list of games to choose from. Each golf ball has a microchip that can record where it lands to accurately track the score.   I found that cool af. We had a few issues getting the game set up and some problems with the player rotation, but Lela was sure to get it resolved as soon as possible.\n\nFood was also good! Our favorites were the rock shrimp and the sliders. I would recommend checking this place out if you wanted to do something different in LV.
