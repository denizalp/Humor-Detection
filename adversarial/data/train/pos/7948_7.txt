This used to be our favorite hotel to stay in. Not anymore. My girlfriend and I came out to Las Vegas to celebrate her birthday. I booked the room a month in advance and everything seemed like it was gonna be a good stay. We were thrilled about the discount we got on the room since we were part of their Grazie loyalty program.\n\nFast forward to check in:\n\nWe get into the room and I rush to the restroom. When you gotta go, you gotta go. I look at the toilet and there are dried up urine stains on the porcelain toilet. \n\nI called the front desk right away and made it clear that this was unacceptable. For an hour I got bounced around from room to room and every room had disgusting and half-done cleaning jobs. I was passed on from customer service reps to security personnel to finally a housekeeping manager who FINALLY informed me that they are looking into it.\n\nWord of advice: if you don't value the money you spend on a \"nice\" vacation then by all means stay at the palazzo where sanitation and customer service are the last of their priorities
