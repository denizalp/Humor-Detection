A Thursday night in late July 2014....\n\nI get to the line at oh 2am or so? an security says $20 to get in. Next thing I know, I get to the register an its $30. The guy who just told me $30 (and a manager) is now gone and vanished. All the other security people were assholes EXCEPT the lady at the register who also didnt give a shit. it was 2AM. No Respect!\n\nSo anyway, I went in, up the escalators  thru some cave looking thing and the place is full, not too full whatever. Didn't really resemble a bank except for the dance floor built down into the club i guess? then its tier style look. \n\nThere were not alot of girls there......\n\nBest part is one of the bartenders was really cool and laid back. He was a bartender for the bank at bellagio but acted like he was in a dive bar. \n\nI will probably never be back. Just a basic nightclub.
