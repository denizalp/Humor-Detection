Wow, I am surprised to see all the bad reviews about this company but I am not surprised. I haven't had any real problems with them, and I've flown with them about 10 times in the last 4 years. My main complaint are the crowded seats, and it's usually always FREEZING! I couldn't believe there weren't any free snacks but there are always ways around that. This review however is in regards to when me, my Mom and Aunt flew for the UNR graduation. My Mom accidentally left her phone charging next to a lady by the gate when I boarded with the disabled passengers because I am disabled. She immediately tried to jump off board to grab it but she was told she couldn't leave the plane. The lady who had been sitting by the phone thankfully grabbed it and had given it to the Agent at the gate. My Mom asked numerous times if they were going to give her the phone. 2 out of 4 attendants were nonchalant about it. Ok, lets see how you'd act if it were your expensive I-phone. Luckily the woman who turned it in kept getting up and showing staff who's phone it was and she got it back right before we took off.
