I don't like the drugs but the drugs like me. \n\nThis is too much trouble just to get in. You got to get free passes from the Hotel or else, you're looking to pay $35 for the guys and $10- 15 for the ladies. Don't stay too long, you will be broke, about $9 to $15 per drink. Other than that, you will get a beautiful view of the city, a little dance floor, decent music, and somewhat of a place to sit. If money is no issue, go reserve a booth. There, you will get table service and rip-off! Good luck!
