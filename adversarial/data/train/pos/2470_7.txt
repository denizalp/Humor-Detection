Don't believe the rumors. It's true that you really can find a pair of nice boots for a reasonable price here. I did just that today! On the hunt for a new pair of boots, I decided to give Saba's a try although I figured that they would be well out of my price range. I walked into the shop and was immediately greeted by the fresh smell of leather and fine quality leather at that. They have boots of every shape and size here, as well as every price! It's true that you can get booths for several hundred dollars, but you can also find boots for closer to $100 and if you're really lucky, find a pair that's on sale for even less. When I went today, I was lucky enough to visit during a sale where every pair of boots is 20% off! Not bad at all! The boots are high in quality, comfortable and in every style. The staff knows what they are talking about. Although this shop is in the heart of touristville, this local is a fan and plans on visiting again and I plan on sending all my friends and family here when they need boots.
