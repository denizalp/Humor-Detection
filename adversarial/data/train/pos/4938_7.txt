This is a new location as the Shoppers that was in the Malvern Mall was closed down and moved here. I have found that the store is much nicer, as it is new, the staff is friendly, and there are some groceries for sale. \n\nI like that this store has new nice look to it, this is a new construction so it looks new. It's a little more modern. The staff here is actually very friendly they are ready to answer your questions, mostly the staff is near the front of the store so this is where you will find them. I have been happy with the way the staff has treated me while I visit, friendly and courteous. \n\nWhile this store it not open all night, it is upon until 10pm which is still pretty good. Plus you can get some groceries like egg, milk, bread, and a few fruits and veggies. In an emergency it's nice to know that there is a back up place.
