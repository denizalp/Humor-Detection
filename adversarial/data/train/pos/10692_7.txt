If you're looking for the full Vegas experience, this is not the place to stay. But if you're into vacationing at a place with a 1980's apartment complex vibe, you won't do much better!  \nWe were stranded at the airport after a flight cancellation, and the airport put us up here. Had a relaxing time at one of the smaller pools (3 total), because most people go to the big one near the lobby. The restaurant served us a tasty dinner, from a small menu. Happy Hour was fabulous. Dinner, coffee, 3 drinks was less than $20 for me, personally. If we'd had any energy, we could've easily gone across the street to the Hard Rock Hotel & Casino, but alas, we were drained. \nThe staff is friendly, helpful & patient, and they treated us like paying guests. I appreciated that. There's a tiny gift shop with cheap souvenirs, too. Woot!
