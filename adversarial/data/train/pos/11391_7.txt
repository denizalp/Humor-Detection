I was very excited about the SLS opening in Vegas. They promised a Umami burger and griddle cafe (which is no longer there), for a young man in his early 20's this meant convenience until i found out where it's location would be. Put off and so I put it off for a couple years. \n\nFast forward to 2016, the mark up on Valentines Day\/Presidents weekend was ridiculous, I found myself kind of forced to go to Vegas and was struggling to find a fair priced room. After continuous searches I came across the year of the monkey promotion at the SLS. Shout out to curious george, the price was more than reasonable (about 50% off their standard rate for that weekend +5o$ credit for food and beverage) and so I decided to make this my home for a couple nights.\n\nCheck-in\/Check-out\n\nThe gentleman that helped me check-in was not the most personable person in the city, he had the service skills of someone that should be working at the palace station. But at least he was properly trained on how to check in and hand guest their keys. The young lady checking me out did better, buuuut also lacked more smiles.\n\nOverall Service\n\n75% of the employees here are amazingly friendly! I cannot remember one sour face in the casino, the dealers made you feel comfortable regardless of whether or not you were wearing hangover clothes at the table. There were some rotten apples in the bunch as you would expect at a hotel with so many employees, but none that made my stay unpleasant.\n\nTHE GUILLERMO EXPERIENCE\n\nI had a gentleman show up to my room to clean up a glass that broke (it wasn't my fault I promise) and he was very nice, funny and a hard worker! He made sure to go through proper protocol when cleaning the glass up. He swept, vacuumed and mopped and then called me over to ask me if it looked good. Guillermo you're the man!\n\nThe Rooms\n\nI booked two rooms in the world tower with opposite views. One was of the stratosphere and the other of a construction zone. I guess that leaves us even, knowing I used a promotional rate I wasn't expecting the penthouse view. The rooms themselves are small but big enough if you're keeping it to 2 per room, I'd imagine 4 people in one of those to be claustrophobic but thankfully I did not get to experience that myself. The mirrors light up and provide enough light to emulate day time 24\/7. The bathrooms were good, the products were in bigger than average containers, which made me not have to worry about squeezing out too much. Decent rooms.\n\nThe Casino\n\nVery small and missing the high roller Vegas feel that many come to Vegas for. But okay for quick play. \n\nAmenities \n\nTheir restaurant line up has a 3-5 star offering in every price range. They have a gift shop and a couple boutique stores. Not bad for not being the center of attention. Their pool was open but I did not check it out. I'd say they have something to satisfy your needs to a certain degree. There is also a walgreens right across the street which I visited over 5 times? \n\nSecurity\n\nThey check the keys, even though it's just a flash and anyone with an unvalid key could walk by and tag along with someone it's nice to have. I didn't have any issues with them and I did not see them having any issues with anyone. It's safe (no pun intended) to say it was a calm weekend in there.\n\nValet\n\nValet was could be improved. They do take a while to bring you your vehicle, so maybe call ahead of time. The service was alright, except for one driver who came running to assist us when they were in the middle of a rush, so proactive! I wish I would of gotten their name. \n\nThe Bad\n\nAside from the valet here are some of the things my mind compiled. The smell when you first walk in is a migraine starter, but somehow you manage to get used to it within the first minute though. As many have said, what's the theme? It has very unusual aesthetics and the decor can at times come off as trying too hard to be chic. What's up with the interior of the elevators? The hallways are very boring on the floors to your room. Despite the rooms being lit up, most of the hotel is darker than I would have liked. There's a dryness in the overall vibe of the hotel, that has no relation to the staff.\n\nShould you stay? \n\nIn emergency situations and when there is no other alternative, yes. The hotel really is not a mess as long as you get a clean room and respected by the staff. But I'd suggest working overtime or selling a couple things on ebay leading up to your trip so you can drop 50$-75$ more to stay elsewhere. The confusion lies within the desire to make this a boutique like hotel and the fact that its location really handicaps their potential. If hotels start opening up in the northern part of the strip though, I'd really like to see this hotel flourish. I am also curious to see how it all works out when the W opens up adjacent to them this year. For now I will keep my nights some where else but nevertheless I will keep my eye on their growth.
