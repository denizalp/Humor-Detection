I tend to agree that the show itself was entertaining, and it had a little bit of everything to keep you interested.  In terms of venue it's nothing like the stages like the O @ the Bellagio or Phantom @ the Venetian, but this a pretty friendly to all ages, and is a low key, no frills entertainment show inside of the Planet Hollywood, where you just grab a seat and watch these performers go at it on stage.  You get a little bit of everything from this show, which is nice if you are with people how cannot decide what they want to watch, you get a mixture of jugglers, comedians, magicians, musicians and even some aerobatics.  It's kind of a grab bag, so you don't really know what you are going to get on any given night.\n\nTickets go for about 50.00 bucks, but we managed to get get ours for free, I will say go early, they will make you wait outside for a bit and a decent sized line will build up, so seating will fill up fast when they open the doors.  Also I will agree, that they seem to really want to cram you in there, I'm not a tall man, but even my leg room was a little tight, additionally if you get seated behind a tall person, have fun contorting your body so you can watch the show.  The show itself was fun, and there definitely some talent with these performers, to bad the experience get spoiled by to poorly thought out floor plan.
