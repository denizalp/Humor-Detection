Grandma's Kitchen.............it looked like grandmas kitchen, but didnt feel like it. The decor was pretty solid and had a country feel. I wanted to like this place, I really did.................My GF and I decided to have breakfast here on a Saturday moring. \n\nThere was no one there when we arrived, service was prompt and items were delivered prompt. I had no clue what my waitress' name was or her helper. There was no review of the specials or the daily quiche availability. \n\nThere was plenty of time to decide on what to order,........though i could feel the service staffs eyes burning a hole in the back of my head while I reviewed the menu. \n\nI could also hear the Cooks kitchen conversation going on, it wasnt vulgar or anything but honestly it was kinda weird, and not that cooks are supposed to look professional or anything, but when they come out of the back to get coffee, maybe say hi rather than staring at us from the other side of the counter. \n\nPortions were good, I am Biased against fake eggs, by fake eggs I mean Eggbeaters and this is what they use for Omelets, no flavor at all. The Sausage patties were pretty good but kinda thin. There was also an unusual display fridge with items in it, not sure what it was for, or what the items inside were for.\n\nI gave this a 2 star rating because of atmosphere, service staff and price. \n\nI also think a local paper would go a long way......\n\nThey Swung for the fences and hit a foul ball.
