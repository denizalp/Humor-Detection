Another cool tea place in Vegas. The place is located off Spring Mountain road (as a lot of good eats are). The place is pretty small,  but has a cozy feel.  The server was pretty nice and made sure we looked our drinks.  I had the  green tea milk cap with egg pudding. My other friend got the caramel milk tea and the butterfly pea drink. The flavors for the drinks are on point. Definitely a cool spot to check out.
