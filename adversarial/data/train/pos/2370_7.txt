Las Vegas? Ya damn straight it is time for Vegas! It was my buddy's birthday and this is how you do Vegas the right way. My other friend wanted to try the food and experience. I saw the Morimoto restaurant ads in January when I walked through the MGM hotel.\n\nI ordered the Omakase which is a Japanese phrase, \"I will leave it up to you chef.\"  The Omakase at this location in Las Vegas, Nevada has five-course meal with dessert.  We decided to get aged sake called Hakkaisan Snow-Aged Junmai Ginjo, three years, for the table.\n\nThe pros are the nigiri is really fresh. Any fresher and the fish will be swimming up to your table. I have been to all you can eat sushi restaurants in Las Vegas and sometimes the the sea urchin has a metallic taste.  The sea urchin at this restaurant has a umami taste but again, it is Morimoto.  The customer service is very on point and they explain how to eat each dish for the Omakase.  We had no problems ordering a table online and surprising the restaurant gets very busy during the night.\n\nThe cons are it is really pricey but you are in Las Vegas. You need to go all out. The Omakase is $140 per person and the bottle of sake we ordered is close to $200 a bottle.\n\nI would recommend this restaurant for the experience and if you like sushi.  Here are the images of my dishes, sake, and price tag.
