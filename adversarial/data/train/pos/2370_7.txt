The worst breakfast I had in Brampton,the eggs were undercooked,I had to explain my order 3 times,my bacon and sausage we're served in napkins cause the 3 girls working said it was against their religion to touch pork products,my coffee was cold and so strong that it looked like mud,plus toast was cold and butter was just pasted on, anyways two bites and a sip of coffee was enough for me and everything went in the garbage and I walked out,I will never recommend or go to this location again.
