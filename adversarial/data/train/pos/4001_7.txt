Proof that we haven't progressed that far from being entertained by jangling keys as a baby.\n\nIt's a fountain with big jets of water shooting into the air. There are musical standards playing. There are hundreds of people staring at the water shooting into the air, mesmerized by SPRAYING WATER.  It makes it harder for me to get down the block to where I'm going, but otherwise I suppose people can enjoy whatever they like.\n\nI just don't get it.
