From a friends recommendation I wanted to try this \"gem\".......\n\nAbsolutely love sushi and been eating sushi for years...... I had ordered their special toro nigiri it came out looking very old and dark brown, ordered a hamachi belly and got the end of the fish which made the sushi verrrrry chewy and not enjoyable, also had a spicy salmon bowl and it was drenched in sauce with horrible pieces of fish.... \n\nWhat a disappointed.. Won't be going back.\n\nService was alright, but all non speaking English servers???!! What a irritating start to a horrible lunch.
