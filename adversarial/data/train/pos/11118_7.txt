Our waitress was nice as were the busboys that ran and got us two packs of smokes for those that were in need.  \n\nHOWEVER, people I'm sorry, but I just don't get it.  The compulsion to hang out in a club playing a mix that has been in effect since spring break 1998, paying THOUSANDS of dollars just to have your own space so you can sit down for a minute before standing up and gyrating like a stripper again, is crazy.  Just CRAZY.  \n\nI should note that perhaps I am just too old for this business, but every time I struggled to squeeze my way to the bathroom and got groped by some guido looking for a, well, you know what he was looking for, I questioned anyone's desire to spend this much money to drink over priced booze and get molested.  But, hey, I guess for some dropping $650 on a bottle of Vodka while getting pawed by some hag who is lip synching walk like an egyptian is a good time.
