If you \"wonder where the hippies went after brushing their teeth with Pepsi-dent\" search no further than Earth Fare.  Name gives it away.\n\nA plethora of organic everything, with prices to match.  And it is super crowded exasperated by people pushing carts in and around the narrow want-to-be aisles, so be mindful in your gawking.\n\nPlenty of soy products, turkey bacon and chicken sausages.  A whole gluten-free area with lots of choices.\n\nThere is a wellness area of all sort of supplements, gluten free shelves, a huge excellent cheese display, a good looking meat (yes...it is shocking to see MEAT in an otherwise pure rendition of the perfect Good Earth grocery), an olive bar, skimpy salad bar and a deli that put together nice sandwiches and soups and even pizza by the slice.\n\nA very good grocery variation if that is your persuasion.  Very \"in\" and trendy with those people who \"know\" health.\n\nIf you have not visited, please do.  You will see offerings offered no where else.  Credit cards accepted, of course.
