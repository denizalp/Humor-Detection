I had never tried Ethiopian food before, so Zoma was an entirely new experience for me. Which no preconceived expectations, I went into the warm and inviting restuarant with an open mind.\n\nFirst off, I really appreciate that Zoma offers sample plates! I ordered the vegetarian combo, and my friend ordered the meat and vegetable combo. Both are served on bread that resembles a large pancake. We also ordered the sambusa with veggies as a starter, which actually was my favorite part of the meal. We enjoyed everything, but just a lesson from my own experience- the way the food is served caused it to cool down pretty quickly, at which point is was a lot less appealing. I'm not taking any points off for that though, because I don't consider it a fault. I just recommend you try to eat quickly :)\n\nI understand that Zoma offers a great coffee ceremony, so I'm hoping to catch that another time! Overall, I enjoyed my meal, and the experience
