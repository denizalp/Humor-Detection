Ok, this place has such a mix of reviews that I know they can't be all true. Come on, give me a break. If I hadn't eaten here on numerous occasions, I wouldn't know what to think. Some days the beer is fantastic and some days it sucks? I think NOT!  \n\nI think that the ups and downs noted are just a matter of individual taste . . . or perhaps, lack of.\n\nI say . . .go try it for yourself.\n\nThe fact that it is a restaurant and brew works that has been put in an old church is worth the trip alone. Worth it just to see what can be done with a great old building and a little imagination.\n\nTry the beer. Have lunch or dinner. See what you think. Don't let a few misguided souls scare you off. \n\nI've usually found that when a place has so many reviews that are so across the board it is because some folks get out of their comfort zone . . . they begin to get uncomfortable when things deviate. Or when you put them in a church.\n\nWell, I'm here to tell you that good food comes in all sorts of shapes & colors & flavors. Of course, so does bad,  But the one thing I know is that . . .  it can't be both. \n\nWhich review to believe?  None! Go try it for yourself!\n\nSo my vote is for 5 stars. I have never been disappointed in the food or the service . . . and by jove, the atmosphere is as close to heaven as you are going to get in a Brew Works!
