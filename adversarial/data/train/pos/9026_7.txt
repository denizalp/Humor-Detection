While my best friend was visiting home, her mother got us tickets to see Jubilee since neither of us had been yet. We were both excited having heard good things about this Vegas icon. Our seats were wonderful as we were situated at a table (VV) near the stage. \n\nPhotography is strictly prohibited with multiple gentlemen monitoring the audience (I'm assuming they've had several issues in the past). It's a really shame though because the costumes are magnificent!! They're gorgeous and sparkly and I was sad that I wasn't able to capture it on camera. But it's a topless revue, so it's completely understandable. \n\nThe themes are really cheesy and I felt transported to old Las Vegas. It was still entertaining and I was mesmerized by the intricate costume designs and of course, the over-the-top headdresses. The women are certainly talented and most of them are beautiful. Some of them seemed really awkward as though they didn't know they would have to show their breasts (I don't know if this is typical, but in a couple acts, a few women performed while covering their breasts with one arm). It was odd.\n\nMy favorite part of the show was the very beautiful crystal-laden costumes in the finale. Just gorgeous. The show isn't that exciting, but I would watch it again just to witness the costumes. Plus, this is a taste of that Las Vegas known for lights, extravagance, and showgirls.
