Three times a charm!  The first time I tried going here in  May they had a sign \"be back at...\" on the door.  (And they weren't back at that time)  The second time in July there was nothing there.  Empty store.  This time I was successful.\n\nSure the prices are ok for a \"boutique\" but to be quite honest the quality is really lacking.  The prices are cheaper than other boutiques but the reason you go to boutiques and pay more money is because you are getting a quality garment.  Here, not so much.  The jersey knit items (and you will find no bigger fan of jersey knit than yours truly) is very cheap and looks like it will pill in a few washings.  There are sequins EVERYWHERE.  On almost EVERYTHING.  Its insane.  Sequins should be used in moderation at best.  And most of the styles were a little passe.  (And some were a LOT passe.)\n\nHonestly, I have to say I was very underwhelmed.  It seemed like the quality of a Forever21 with double (and sometimes triple) the price tag.
