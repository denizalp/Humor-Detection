This restaurant was so awful it ruined my birthday dinner. \nThe only good part of the meal was the basket of RAW vegetables that was brought to the table at the beginning of the meal. \nWe had been waiting an hour for our appetizers to come, and when I finally asked the server when our appetizers were coming, he said that we were supposed to tell him to take away the basket of raw veggies so he could bring our appetizers. WHAT?! Cause it's obviously my job to tell him that we'd been waiting for our appetizers for an hour?! Service was AWFUL. No one asked us a single time if we needed anything. Needless to say we sat there waiting most of the time, with empty water glasses. It was a Tuesday night, and therefore, IT WASN'T EVEN BUSY. Absolutely no excuse. \nThe service wasn't even the worst part. The food was HORRENDOUS. Stuff you would see on kitchen nightmares. The foie gras appetizer did not even taste like foie gras! And it was so expensive! What a ripoff. Our entrees were horrendous. We had the duck breast and the osso buco. Both sauces tasted like disgusting, congealed box gravy, similar to one you would get at a school cafeteria. The meat was sooo over cooked and under seasoned. The mushrooms in the osso buco were RAW. And the duck confit was NOT duck confit. It was just an over cooked duck leg. For dessert, the souffl√© was just sugary scrambled eggs with whipped cream. I could go on and on, but honestly there is no point, because hopefully anyone who reads this will save themselves from an expensive meal for TERRIBLE service and DISGUSTING food.  Save your money and go to a real restaurant.
