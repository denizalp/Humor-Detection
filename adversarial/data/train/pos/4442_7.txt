Stopped in for an early lunch before the crowd. I thought it was really good Texas barbecue even though I'm more of a Kansas City barbecue guy.I got the two meat plate of a chicken thigh and the brisket. He gave me both the flat portion of the brisket and the point (apparently juicer and fattier). I liked both, but I'll go flat next time. The thigh was big, crispy and good. \nNumber 2 in the city, not so sure about that. I'm happy to say I need to do a lot more investigating around town.
