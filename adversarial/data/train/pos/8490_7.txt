I was disappointment the moment we walked in. The staff was rude. The music was ridiculously loud! Somehow having to shout at each other doesn't seem breakfast appropriate.  They are ridiculously overpriced, with everything being an add on you have to pay for.  I can't say anything about the food, because we got up and left. After the negative experience with the staff and atmosphere, we didn't think it'd be likely that the food would be worth it.
