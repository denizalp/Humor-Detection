La Cage aux Sports is a themed chain of restaurants in Quebec. \n\nIt is sort of like TGIFridays meets Hooters Quebecoise.\n\nIt has all the necessary things that any good blue-blooded sports bar would have:\n\nChicken Wings \nLarge flat screen TVs \nBurgers \nTeam banners and jerseys in glass hanging on the walls \nBeer \nYoung female servers with tight fitting tops\n\nI had a salmon filet salad. Good salmon, good variety of greens, but little to no dressing. Also had a \"Mexi-sushi de poulet\" which was small appetizers of cooked chicken, shaped and looking like sushi, with dribbles of spicy sauces on the side of the platter. Interesting.\n\nThis place either likes hockey and goalies, or a French movie about a gay cabaret couple raising a straight son.\n\nOr just a place to drink beer and eat chicken wings while eyeing young female servers in tight t-shirts.
