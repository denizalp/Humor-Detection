I've seen Keisha a few times for deep tissue massage and wow, she's really great. I can't see myself going back to the Elmwood Spa, where I used to go for massages, ever again. None of the massage therapists there have ever come close to the skill Keisha possesses. It's not a fancy place, but the quality of treatment is unsurpassable. The prices are very reasonable too -- $96.05 taxes in, for a 60 minute massage. All covered by my health insurance, which is even better ;)
