It's a pretty good, if not a bit overhyped breakfast sandwich featuring, you guessed it, eggs. The bacon, egg, and cheese was tasty with each individual component being quite good. The bread was a bit soggy though. The iced coffee is quite good and I would almost go back just for that. If only the line weren't so long. It may be the NJ in me, but I definitely didn't think it was worth the wait. Still, it's one of the few places in Las Vegas you can get a good breakfast sandwich and not a huge buffet.
