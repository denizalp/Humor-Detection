3.5* for what I ordered, pumped up for neighbourhood feel, & casual, but friendly\/professional service!\n\n\"There's nothing 'DIET' about this menu\", says the guy running the place to a lady who asks for a Diet Coke.  That about sums it up.\n\nBefore you all throw stones at me, I do NOT order the fried chicken.  Now, after the fact, reading all these reviews, I probably should've ordered it, would've loved it, and could've given this place a more favourable review.\n\nI came here after OktoberFEAST at Wynchwood Barns got rained out.  So myself and my partner in crime used our trusty Yelp app to find a place nearby.  Since we were both starving, I didn't really have time to skim through the reviews to see what was worth ordering here.\n\nWe ordered:\n\nFries ($5) - Really good!\n\nThe Beast Style (single burger $7.50) - It tasted like a Big Mac, with caramelised onions, and a bigger patty.  You do what you will with this info\n\n\"The Castro\" (a.k.a. Cuban sandwich) - contained 2 kinds of pork based cured in-house meats with cheese and some citrus-based flavour.  The 'beige' meat was super, uber fatty.  Not sure if that was on-purpose, but not my thing.\n\nThe meat was seasoned, but it needed SOMETHING, perhaps a sauce of some sort.  I really wouldn't recommend that item.\n\nPlace has a really nice feel to it!  Guy who was running the joint seemed really cool.  Seating only at bar, no tables.\n\nI guess not ordering the fried chicken gives me an excuse to go back? ;)
