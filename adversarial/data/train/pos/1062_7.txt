Too bad there aren't minus stars. Asked for a table for 6. Policy is everyone has to be there to be seated, which is fine. Since we had no idea when #6 would arrive, we asked to be seated ... \"No. I don't have a big enough table yet, anyway, so you're just going to have to wait.\"  Wait, what? Really? I'm just going to have to sit and wait.... My son asked to speak to the manager who didn't care a fig that his staff was rude, but did point out that we didn't have an 'argument' because our party hadn't all arrived. There are several other reviews of the same tone, so I'm going to play armchair psychologist and hazard that they enjoy doing this to folks they don't know and we made their night!  If the last snippy snot remark hadn't been made we would have actually waited ... and been back.
