Ennio is my BFF. I love him, I love his food, I love his jokes, I love his accent; he makes me smile and laugh so hard. He has shared so many stories with me, and at times his food has given me a glimpse of where he's been and what he's about.\n\nMy absolute favourites are the eggplant parm and cannelloni. I've also tried the escargot, gnocchi, and Chez Ennio pasta, all of which were great but didn't hold my attention for as long as the eggplant parm and cannelloni did. I would still absolutely recommend them, though!\n\nThis place definitely has some charm to it; it's cozy and feels like you're sitting in Ennio's living room while he prepares your meal and serves it to you. This is a one-man-show most nights, guys. So tolerate the slowness, go there and enjoy your evening, don't rush through it. Bring a bottle, or two or three, and enjoy the home-style meal with good company.
