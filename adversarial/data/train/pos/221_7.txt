My family and friends normally end up booking half or if not, the entire restaurant for our private parties, so we know when the service is good or bad. My first time coming here was for my neices first birthday and I was thinking it would be your typical Indian restaurant but I totally was wrong. When I walked in, I was greeted by a familiar face from high school and later I found out he's the owner of Avani. The owner helped with the birthday decor and had set up a projector & TV system for my neices birthday video. We also hired a crazy clown who entertained the hyper kids and the owner had no problems with the hectic noise level. I find some Indian restaurants to be run down or dirty but its so nice to see such a clean and nicely decorated place. Now for the tasty stuff. Since it was an 50 people event we catered buffet style to everyone with a selection of 10 different vegetarian\/non-vegatarian entr√©es. The buffet consisted of, samosa rolls, tandoori & vegetable mixed grill, pakora platter, hot and sour soup, chilli chicken, some curries and fried noodles. After trying all of these,  I would say Asian fusion at its finest! The food was so flavourful and delicious, that I savoured every mouth full. The servers made sure the buffet was always full and chef made a  fresh, new batch every 15 minutes. Also, the servers filled up everyones water and came around with complimentary alcoholic\/non-alcoholic beverages that tasted like blueberry fruit punch, it tasted really good! Everyone had a great time especially the birthday girl. I will definitely come back and try more things on the menu and experience a more intimate dining experience so I can give Avani, 5 star rating ;)
