Great hotel.  Has a few bars on the casino floor.  The sports book is pretty nice and there is a bar right by it.  They have a food court and  a movie theater inside.  As far as the rooms they are good.  The hotel charges a $28 resort fee per day.... Just like any other hotel I have no idea why ... they say because of the internet, gym etc. but its just a way to squeeze more $$$ out of you.  The staff was pretty nice when I talked with a few of the bartenders, and dealers.  The check in process was pretty painless.  There is a movie theater and a food court next to it on the south side of the casino.  Also on the northside there is a hooters that serves really good food.  A gift shop is by the front desk.\n\nThe rooms and hotel smell great and I would definitely recommend staying here if you don't mind being off the strip.  You are only like 1 mile off the strip ;)
