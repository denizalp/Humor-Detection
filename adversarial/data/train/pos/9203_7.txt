I am writing this review based on flowers that my husband has sent me recently and in the past. I've never been inside the shop. The bouquets and flowers are always so beautiful and fresh when I receive them. The arrangements are creative and so pretty! Taking a star off because we notice that the flowers seem to wilt and the arrangements die quicker than when he orders them online from, let's say, FTD or 1800 flowers.
