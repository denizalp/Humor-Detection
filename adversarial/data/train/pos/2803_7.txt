Only reason I gave this restaurant even one star is because I had to. You should definitely  eat if you want your order after an hour and a half, it's super cold and lousy, and they didn't give you things you ordered. Also they will call you a liar when you call to talk to them about their mistakes. I must say its the worst pizza place in Las Vegas. Rude and horrible customer service. I find it very disgusting on they way they run a business.
