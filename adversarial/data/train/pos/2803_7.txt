I really like my haircut done by Amber. I waited till the next day after to see how the hair sits without any blowdrying\/additional touches. So far so good. \n\nI have a super thin, fair hair just bit below shoulders, the hair which is wavy only sometimes (depending on the climate) but usually more on straight side. So I wanted to keep growing my hair long, at the same time adding volume +bit shape. Quite difficult to achieve with such hair as mine. I've had my portion of arguing with dozens of stylists\/haircutters over the layers. Usually those layers ended in disasters, they were just messy or hung heavily, and were maintained only through styling. \n\nI specifically told Amber that I want the haircut that wouldn't need any styling, blowdrying etc. She DOES listen to what you say. Finally, the hairdresser\/stylist who does not push on you their opinion:) Amber went very smart about inner layering, so along the way the volume would be more obvious, and for now it stays as clean, shaped haircut. Also she added some very subtle layers to frame my face. I liked that she always checked with me at every stage of the process. \nThe haircut did look sexier with blowdry, but hey I don't complain. It's my choice to not use blowdry\/curler\/hairspray, so I'll find other solutions. The hair sits nicely, feels much freer and healthier. That's what I wanted and that's what I got. So I'm satisfied:) \n\nThe reason why I gave 4 stars (I'd give 4.5 rather):\na) There was no head massage. I mean when they say \"head massage\" is included with women's haircut, I imagine actual soothing head massage that I usually would get at other similar priced salons. \nb) My scalp is super sensitive and even slightest pull of the hair is painful. So it was bit of torture with blowdry and curling with brushes. \nc) They advised me on certain hair brush for thin\/fair hair, so I bought it from them (15$). Meh, tried several times - doesn't really do a job. Doesn't hep untangling hair, just pulls them out or misses the tangled spots.
