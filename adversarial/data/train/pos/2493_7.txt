I remember Nathan Burton from America's Got Talent and was very excited to come see his show while we were in town.  We opted to get assigned seats which for me included the close up magic pre-show but thats usually extra $10 too and totally worth it.  I was blown away by how fast the illusions and the \"magic\" happens I still am amazed how they do it. I'd give anything to learn some of the secrets to the magic they do it is just mind blowing what they can do right in front of your eyes!!  This show is worth every penny and its family friendly and since its in the afternoon it keeps your evening free and you can come beat the heat of the day for an hour (or two if you do the pre-show) The Saxe Theater is located in the Miracle Mile to the right of Planet Hollywood. If you are in town come and see the show you will not be disappointed. If you see the show you get 50% of another show in the other theater next door. HINT:  if you don't like stairs or have knee issues etc. ask for the elevator cause its a few flight of stairs up to the theater but only if you have assigned seats cause general admission is first come first served and all the good seats will be gone by the time you wait for the elevator.  Which brings me to HINT#2 just pay the extra get the assigned seats and upgrade and see the closeup magic show its pretty good!
