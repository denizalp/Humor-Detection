rio hotel location...between elevators and lobby....casual bar restaurant...looking for a quick lunch...finding a basic american menu...burgers, salads, steaks, appetizers, etc....looking for a healthy option and taking the grilled chicken cobb salad for $17...soda $3.50 with endless refills...service was decent...orders taken...drinks refilled...occasionally checking on customers....the food wasn't that great...avocado was perfectly ripe and green, but the grilled chicken didn't taste fresh...probably cooked in a past life and reheated before serving...salad was very simple underneath the chicken and avocado...not too large....thought the food quality was poor....
