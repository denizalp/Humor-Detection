My first visit impressions of this restaurant were \"OMG I know I'm going to love this place!\" I was already excited when I viewed the menu and saw the mix of Asian fuzed dishes. I didn't follow the tv show Restaurant Express but saw snippets of Chef Longest making some dishes that sounded yummy! \n\nOur first server was also one of the contestants .. Eric??..sorry I didn't watch the show..but he mentioned that he was with Chef Longest on the show. He was very enthusiastic and went over the menu page by page with us. Answered our questions and gave his suggestions as well. \n\nThere was a good representation of Korean, Chinese and Japanese inspired offerings. Even the desserts sounded so good! When I saw they had Green Tea Brulee, I told Mr. B I wanted that for dessert!  The prices were really reasonable. Most plates under $10.  The specialty dishes are couple dollars more ie $30 for 1 1\/2lb for lobster.  That's heck inexpensive for me..(esp since Im used to paying $$) You cant go wrong with that!  \n\nIt's tapas style. Small plates meant to be shared so the portions served are just right. So we could easily try all kinds of different dishes. They took our orders and spread out the order  so everything brought to our table was hot, and we got to take our time and pace ourselves since we ordered alot of food.  We ended up having a total of 11 items. \n\n2 Specialties: Korean Style Lobster & Chinese Lemon Chicken\n2 Soups & Noodles: Mandarin Beef Noodle Soup & Chow Fun\n2 Appetizers: Duck Sliders & Chicken Lettuce Wraps\n2 cocktails- Asian inspired with Pomegranate and Watermelon liqueurs\n3 desserts --yes three... Strawberry Yuzu White Chocolate Mousse, Banana Egg Rolls, Green Tea Brulee  which was a surprise!  They gave me a complimentary dessert for my birthday! My server heard me saying I wanted it...very attentive!!\n\nThe standouts and faves -  The Mandarin Beef Noodle Soup & Korean Style Lobster.\n\nI digged the Lobster dish! You are served the whole shebang! Body, legs,the tail. Sherry Soy was the sauce and  ginger was the prominent flavors I tasted.  It was tossed with some veggies but I didn't really bother with them, I was too busy digging for lobster meat, which was succulent, tasted fresh, high quality. That good! \n \nThe broth in the beef noodle soup is delicious! I .loved the herbs and spices in it. The flavors gave the beef broth  alot of depth, I want to say star anise is in it. It was so fragrant. Totally enjoyed the soup and would order it again. \n\nMr B.s fave was the Chow Fun, I tried some, the beef is really tender. The flavors in all the appetizers we tried we both enjoyed. The only dish I probably would pass up next time is their lemon chicken.  It is very good flavoring wise, but we prefer breading that's more on the crispy side. The breading texture wise, was a little too thick for me. \n\nDesserts - I'd go again with the Strawberry Yuzu White Chocolate Mousse and Green Tea Brulee. These desserts have the right amount of sweetness and are light.  The banana chocolate eggrolls are good as well if you want a more rich, decadent chocolate treat. \n\nService & Atmosphere -  Very nice set up! A touch of class and elegance, yet casual enough where you don't have to wear formal attire. \n\nService was OUTSTANDING! From the minute we were greeted at front by the hostess and manager to the team of servers. Reservations were made via Opentable and when we arrived we were seated right away.  I have a  preference noted on my Opentable profile for window seating. The hosts saw that and I was given the table in the VIP area since it was the one with a view available. Very nice too, it's separate from the main dining area. \n\nAlso servers were very attentive. When I pointed out to Mr. B. I want to try the Green Tea Brulee for dessert.our server must have heard me since guess what they gave me for my special birthday treat?? Great job there Team Jayde Fuzion! \n\nBest thing I like is this place is pretty reasonable. Enough so, Im adding this culinary destination to our weekly dinner rotation!
