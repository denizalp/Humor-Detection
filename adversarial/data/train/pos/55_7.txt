Soco Kitchen and Bar is located in the Delta Toronto hotel.  Since we stayed there, and didn't want to order room service, we decided to come here and try out breakfast before our tour at CN Tower.\n\nThey do have a buffet if you want to take that route.  However, please note that the buffet is only open until 9am.  It's more for the business crowd, I guess, because the Financial District is just down the street.  And, It's $23 ($18 USD) for the weekends and $29 ($22 USD) on weekdays, thus proving my point even more.  If you don't want the buffet, you can also just order from the menu, which we did.  My wife and kids had the standard breakfast fare and I had a dish called Shakshuka (with potatoes).  It is a Middle Eastern dish with Sausage, poached eggs, and a delicious ragu.  While I wish there was more ragu, the dish itself was fantastic!  A definite must order if I see it at another restaurant (since I probably won't be in the area again for awhile).\n\nIf you just want some quick food to go, you can also walk to the back of the restaurant and to the left.  They have a Soco To-Go section in where you can grab a quick lunch, dinner, or snack.
