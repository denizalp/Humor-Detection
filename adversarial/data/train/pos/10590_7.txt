This place was good. Everything we had was very tasty. Everyone working here is really nice. So why only a 3 stars A-OK experience?\n\nIt's a food running, kitchen execution issue. We were sitting at the bar where we could openly see everything that was happening in the kitchen. My friend ordered sliders with fries and I ordered Mac n Cheese. \n\nUsually at a sit down restaurants where you're paying over $10 a plate, the food comes more or less at around the same time. The sliders came first. Waited 5 minutes, then the server came to ask how everything was. IThis was strange since they could see that I hadn't gotten my dish yet.  After a little while, Mac n Cheese materialized on the pass, but no one was around to run the food to the table. The Sous chef hit the bell to call for a runner, but no one came. It didn't seem like it was a big priority that no one was running the dish that they had just taken the time to create. There's nothing more frustrating to see your food prepared and ready to be served, but no one is around to bring it to you. And it wasn't that anyone was slacking, everyone was actually busy at tables. \n\nI think the food sat there for a good 3-4 minutes before a Manager came by. The Manager ran the food to us, put the Mac and Cheese down on the other side of my friend from where I was sitting. Obviously the plate was for me but even so.. This problem can be avoided with a simple seat number system when the server takes the order.\n\nJust some constructive criticism. I hope they rethink this side of the service and staff some runners or serving assistants and when I'm back again sometime, I hope to have an above and beyond experience.
