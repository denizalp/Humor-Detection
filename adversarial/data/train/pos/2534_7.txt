I took my mom and my aunts to afternoon tea service recently.  Served in the lobby tea court, we were seated near the hotel entrance.  I wished I had thought to request a nice window seat when making the reservation, but it was still a lovely setting.  The pianist was a nice touch as well.\n\nFor $36 per person, the tea includes a variety of finger sandwiches, scones, and desserts...oh, and tea.  There is also an option for champagne ($45?), but we declined.  And let's face it, an afternoon with relatives is more likely to require bourbon, rather than champagne.  Just kidding mom (she may be trolling my reviews).  There's a nice tea selection, and everyone gets their own pot (of tea that is).  Also, rather than the tiered trays, your server will offer you each course.  First up were the tea sandwiches (chicken salad, egg salad, smoked salmon, English cucumber, and asparagus with garlic herb mousse).  Surprisingly, my favorite was the asparagus.  Not surprisingly my least favorite was the cucumber.  Cucumber + white bread = bland in my book.  BTW, in case you think afternoon tea should be a full, gut-exploding meal, you can have as many as you want.  Second course were scones-plain and cranberry-served with the expected lemon curd, strawberry jam, and cream.  And if that's not sweet enough for you, the final course is a variety of mini desserts.  By then, even I could not manage to sample one of everything, but I tried.\n\nMy only criticism is that a few things were not quite as polished as I would have expected.  The server spilled some of the tea as she was setting one of the pots down (certainly understandable and forgivable), and my aunt's teacup was not quite clean (not as excusable) and she had to request another.  \n\nBut overall, a very nice afternoon.  And since it was my mom's birthday, they brought her an assortment of cookies to take home and the pianist played Happy Birthday (several times in fact, so I'm not quite sure who it was for).
