My toddler has been really fussy lately because he's got a bunch of teeth coming in at once.  When I heard there was a place we could trade him in for a newer model, I was excited at first.  But from reading the reviews here, I don't feel that this place is anything like what its name implies, and furthermore it appears to have closed down.  They get a mediocre three stars from me, but I might have given them five (or one) if only they were around to address my concerns.
