I went straight to the bar and grabbed the only two seats remaining on a Friday night.  I was just to the right of the taps, which sadly, only had three options: Creemore, Steamwhistle, and something else I can't remember.  Okay, I went for the food and not the beer, but it would have been nice to get a cold Stella! Plus, way too much head on my Creemore.\n\nSo, I ordered the Sardine Pizza, but was soon told they were out of Sardines.  SO DISAPPOINTING.  Got the Hot Pepper \/ Homemade Sausage instead, and was very surprised.  The dough was slightly crisped but just rubbery enough, and the sauce was all about the tomato.  Simple and effective without drowning in extra spices and flavours.\n\nThe ring of crust around the edge was a little too puffy and crisp for my liking - but we had our own chili-oil bottle in front of us to keep it moist.\n\nService wasn't the best, but it was a very busy night and the lineup was out the door.\n\nI will definitely go back for the pizza, I just hope the 2nd time around they have stocked SARDINES.
