I just could not resist Lunch Specials of any kind...\n\nAt Boneyard Grill, $9.99 gets you a 10oz Sirloin Beef Burger, Fries and Drink is not bad at all.\n\nMy friendly waitress welcomes me and reminds me about the lunch specials... she doesn't realize that's the reason I am here!\n\nThe patty can be cook medium well or even medium, I opt for medium. However, I found though it is cooked with a hint of pink inside, the patty is kind of on the dry side. Maybe because Top Sirloin is just a little too lean... too healthy? I want my juicy fatty burger!!\n\nShoestrings Fries are light and crispy, which I enjoy! \n\nDrinks here for a can of pop is $2.25 which is included in the combo.. you can upgrade that to other drinks with additional charges.\n\nServices is so good... I cannot believe I am at a Rib and Burger Joint?! Real Napkins not the paper type? Nice Table setting? The decoration remembers me of Italian restaurants....\n\nTuesday AYCE Ribs for $24.95... apparently Boneyard has their house brand BBQ sauce... I wondering how many ribs can I eat? Maybe I should test my limit!!
