Not good.\n\nThey were unable to send the same crew each week so there was no continuity.  Additionally, they were very very rough on our belongings.  The broke a lazy susan in my kitchen and did not tell me.  They also dragged expensive speakers (that they had been told multiple times not to touch) across our hardwood floors - and scratched them.  They also moved everything around.  When I have maids in, I expect the house to look reasonably the same except cleaner - not with everything moved around.\n\nI was very clear to them from the beginning: I left notes every week and was told that my instructions were being put on file.\n\nThe owner called me about the scratched floors... said he would have them looked at \/ fixed.  I cancelled service with them after they broke more things and have not heard back since.
