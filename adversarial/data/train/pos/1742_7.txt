The staff is rude but I think I enjoy the abuse. For the great pricing, they could cane me for all I care. I can get my dress jackets dry cleaned for $7. That 3-piece leisure suit of mine can be cleaned and pressed for $14. The best part is, if I happen to not make it in to pick up my clothes on the day they're ready (or the week they're ready), the staff doesn't seem too concerned.\n\nSure, it's next to ghetto Fry's. But I've been pleased with the results for the past year so I'll continue to patronize Key Cleaners.
