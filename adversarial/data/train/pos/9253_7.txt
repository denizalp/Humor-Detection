My BF doesn't even write reviews on yelp, and he was considering writing a five star review about this buffet located in the M Resort on the way in to Vegas. He was swept off his feet by the beautiful cut of prime rib. \n\nI would have given it five stars except I got a crappy, less succulent end cut of the prime rib - what, you don't think girls can differentiate beautiful meat from mediocre? I beg your pardon!\n\nThe majority of the food was amazing, and the variety was out of this world - literally. They had cuisine from so many different cultures!\n\nThe dessert bar was good - definitely try the custard-filled puffs and house-made ice cream.\n\nI almost forgot to mention the endless beer and wine benefit of this buffet! (How could I?!) I think that may have been due to the total distraction by (and fullness from) the food. :)\n\nThe line, even on a weeknight, was worse than Disneyland. We waited about a half hour, which was actually less than expected, but it was toward the end of the dinner rush. \n\nI still think the Wynn buffet is more amazing, but it's also twice the price. Our dinner on a Thursday night was $22.99. (Should I consider the beers we purchased at a casino bar for the wait in line in that cost? We had to save our sanity!)
