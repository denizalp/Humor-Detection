Jamaican, Mexican Chinese food are you kidding me?  Somehow it all works.  \n\nIt's quirky and fun although a bit confusing at first but they are patient, friendly and helpful.   If you can't decide what you want they will let you taste before you get in line to order.   I tasted the jerk chicken which was excellent.  I was in a mexican mood so I went with carnitas and machaca which was good and fresh but  a bit plain for me.  I got the impression from everyone else at the table that chinese was the way to go.\n\nThe snickerdoodles cookie served with every order is a nice touch. \n\nPrices are really reasonable -great for lunch!\n\nChinsalutemon'
