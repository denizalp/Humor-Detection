First time visiting Arizona and I'm very happy I found this place. I'm a very picky eater so finding new places I love can always be a challenge but this was amazing! I got 3 of the 4 tacos and they were all AMAZING. The taco that has potato on it is killer.. I would have never thought to do that. I honestly would come all the way back to Arizona just to get some more food from here!
