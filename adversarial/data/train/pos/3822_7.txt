Walking along the the Plateau, near Papineau and Mont-Royal snuck in a bit at a Reitman's store do a little Christmas gift shopping, my cousin and I got hungry and needed a place to use the little girl's room. Lol. We stayed snd ordered, wasn't our first choice , the place was pretty clean but poorly ventilated, the floors were kind of greased up , really old table benches,  the waitress greeted us was nice though pretty impatient wanted to rush our order, i guess because it was 2 hrs to closing. In any case we ordered 2 primeburger trios and wow. One of the best burgers i ever had, and good fries. I'll be back soon for another.
