This was my first experience at a day club, and I would say that it was decent.\n\nI was here on a Sunday to see Tiesto, and he put on a pretty good set. He knew how to keep the crowd entertained and put on some great throwbacks for a fun Sunday vibe. *Note: We arrived at Wet at around 1 and Tiesto didn't come on till close to 4...\n\nOther notes:\n- If Uber\/Lyfting, the map will direct you to the MGM grand entrance, but this is incorrect. The entrance to Wet is actually on the side of MGM, on Koval Lane, between E. Harmon and E. Tropicana.\n- Locker rentals - $40 for your whole stay\n- Not any shade at all except at the bar
