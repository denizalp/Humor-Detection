I honestly have no idea how a place like this can get that many good reviews. \n\nI sometimes wonder if the people here have any idea what a good cocktail is. \nBecause I can't believe we just got unlucky tonight. \n\nI love cocktails. When I went back to Paris I was amazed to see a few amazing cocktails bars and I was so sad to leave, but in my mind I was hoping it would be ok, I would get good cocktails bars some place else. Well it's definitely not in Montreal that I'll have the chance to experience that again. \n\nBecause this one is supposed to be one of the best. And what do you get ?\n\nA glass of ice with cinnamon flavoured water. \n\nI seriously couldn't drink it. The ice glass came with three straws. I tried the three of them to hopefully get a taste of the cocktail and ... Nothing. I never thought I would ever have to suck so much on something. \nJoke aside, I said to the waiter that I just couldn't drink it and he told me \"bring it to the bartender and ask him\" \nMaybe when he saw my face he decided it was his job to bring the drink back and try to do something about it. \n\nSo I don't really now what they did with it, changed the straws, add more water to it, I have no idea. \n\nWhen I was finally able to drink it, it tastes like cinnamon water. And I'm not exaggerating. \n\nMy friend Karim came from Paris and I wanted to show him a good place. I was ashamed. Literally ashamed of what Montreal has to offer when it comes to cocktails. \n\n\nThis place is a joke. \n\nI have no idea how it gets good reviews. Absolutely no ideas. But good for them I guess. Maybe I'm too picky. \n\n\nOh, if you're a fan of sucking hard to get cinnamon flavoured water : THIS IS THE PLACE
