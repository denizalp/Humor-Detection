After my family & I have patronized this place for years I can say I'm done and won't be back. Wouldn't honor a gift certificate that was expired by a couple weeks but saying did.honor until a week ago like that was a consolation to us. The quality has declined so much in recent years that it's not even the same restaurant & seems consistent with reviews and SERIOUS lack of patrons. Not one table non bar area at 6pm.  \n... USED to be good...oh well live & learn. Bad business as my mom would use for catering twice a year I said if she orders from here again  I'll get drive thru. Same quality.
