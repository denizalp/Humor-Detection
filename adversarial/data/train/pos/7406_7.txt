The problem? Access to the pool if you are over 40. \n\nFrankly, I think it borders on age discrimination.  \n\nI'm 62, my husband is 60. I was nearly in tears after my experience trying to get to the pool and just read a book. There was NO mistaking that I was not welcome and neither was my husband. He was astonished. \n\nMy husband and I happily spread on our SPF 15 and I picked up a book I had been wanting to relax and read without interruption, something I love doing on vacation. My husband went down ahead of me, he was so excited to go swimming. He returned, 15 minutes later, angry.\n\nThe \"host\" at the pool's entrance told him to go change out of his jersey, which he did. He gets that. No jerseys. Too controversial.\n\nThen he started giving him grief about his surgical shoes, which he has to wear. \"What's up with THAT?\" And then, the turquoise t-shirt he had put on to replace the jersey...\"If that doesn't get you a foo-foo drink, nothing will.\"\n\nLGBT discrimination, too? Really? My husband is obviously straight, but sensitive to the rights of others.\n\nMy husband got to the pool, but was told he couldn't sit here, couldn't sit there, why don't you go over there? Why don't you go to the Flamingo? Or Caesars? \n\nSo we stay at the Cromwell and are invited to schelp over to another hotel to use the pool with all the other old people. Got it.\n\nThen I decided to check it out. I was thinking my husband was over-reacting, but I was wrong. I was also the wrong age and probably the wrong size to be seen by the pool. (I'm overweight by about 30 lbs). \n\nI got to the \"host\" ---unsmiling, unwelcoming---who told me all the things I couldn't bring--hand sanitizer, aspirin, etc. etc. \n\nOK. Then he looked at my shorts and tshirt and said \"You have to be in beach wear.\"\n\n\"Neither you nor I wants me to walk across the casino in my bathing suit,\" I said, Pulling up my t-shirt to reveal my bathing suit underneath.\n\nThen he invited me to go to the Flamingo or Caesar's. Same thing. Stay here, but don't try to get to the pool if you're older or not in a string bikini. e\n\nFinally I said, \"Is this an age thing?\" and I actually appreciated his saying, \"Yes, it probably is.\"\n\nWe're from California where our age discrimination laws are clear. But before we made reservations, it wasn't clear that the pool was more for the Millennials...and not only that...if you're older, you will be harassed.\n\nMy husband met a woman our age in the elevator who also left. She had Advil and was told she couldn't bring that to the pool. \n\nIt was as if every excuse in the book was dreamed up to keep the unsightly old people away from the pool. \n\nI was near tears, but I did tell the desk clerk about my experience. She invited me to go to the Flamingo or Caesar's pool.\n\nI rest my case. \n\nI informed her, politely and quietly, that we were Diamond card holders, but we would not be back.
