There is literally nothing more appealing than a warehouse full of trampolines, meaning Jump Street is probably one of the coolest places on the west side of the Valley. \n\n$10 gets you in for two hours on Tuesday\/Thursdays, and you'll get your cardio workout for sure. They have a large area just for jumping, as well as, two smaller \"arenas\" for dodge ball. You haven't played real dodge ball until you've done Hollywood stunts on a trampoline to avoid getting hit. \n\nThey have several \"extra\" attractions that cost a little more than the regular trampolines. It's all worth it if you go on the days that have cheaper pricing. There are also designated kids areas for smaller children to play without the possibility of getting hurt by a rambunctious high schooler. \n\nI love this place, and I'm not exactly a kid anymore either. In fact, when my better half and I visit this place we might just be the oldest people jumping. Jump Street offers serious fun to all age groups; check out their website for videos and special pricing.
