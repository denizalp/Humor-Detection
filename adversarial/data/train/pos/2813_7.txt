Good food. I've gotten some tacos that had lots of fat and gristle in them, and some that were just great tasting asada. It's hit or miss. I love them when they are right though. Lines can be really long, so go with a group, so each person can stand in the specific line of the item you want, and you can all congregate with your food and eat on! Great place, but it does get really busy sometimes.
