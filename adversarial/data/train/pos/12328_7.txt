We took clients out to this restaurant and it was awful. It starts with everything being \"tapas\" style which is horrible for a group unless you're really close.  You have to decide if you all want the $125 piece of pork or the $90 beef.... which is impossible with 5 people! They kept forgetting our food- we had to order the appetizers three times. They never brought our soup.  We got our $$$pig 20 minutes after they showed it to us (I would prefer to get all our meet simultaneously otherwise one person gets stuck waiting... then we had to ask for our vegetables AGAIN!!!\n \nThe main thing is that we spent $1000+ for five people and NOTHING we had was event remotely remarkable.\n\nFood:\nCotton candy fois gras, interesting, but $8 each, no.\nAbalone- pretty good\nShrimp and crab cocktail - Ridiculous! It was so small!\nSoup- never got it\nWagyushi (sp?) beef- eat at Ruth Chris- so much better and you don't have to cut it yourself\nWagyu beef on rocks- they cooked it for us, but it was cold by the time we got to 2nd piece\nPig- chewy and with boney pieces inside.\nCauliflower- yeah. It was cauliflower \nBrussel sprouts- much better anywhere else\n\nAt the end they felt bad (maybe?) that they forgot everything so they brought us a \"Don't be a Lemon\" frozen cocktail made with liquid nitrogen- it BURNED the crap out of our mouths- BURNED!  Was it the liquid nitrogen? Wtf?\n\nDo NOT WASTE YOU MONEY TO BE TRENDY and eat here!
