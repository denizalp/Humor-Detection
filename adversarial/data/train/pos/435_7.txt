I came down here to set up an account for water and sewer in our new home. They wanted me to come downtown and pay a deposit of $210.00. I thought that was a little over the top. When I arrived the office is set up like a bank with multiple windows. There was only one person at one window so I got a served right away. The woman at the window was very pleasant and got my account set up in minutes. After taking my deposit she reassured me that I would get that deposit back when I end service. I think the customer service is great, but the deposit fee is outrageous. It should be half of that at most.
