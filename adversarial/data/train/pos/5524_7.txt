Snuck in here to quench a hunger and douse the damage 8 cocktails was doing to my body. We just wanted a quick snack so a nice slice of greasy pizza was going to do the trick.\n\nSlices weren't badly priced, $4 for a slice of cheese, $4.50 for a slice of pepperoni. We ordered then sat in the darkly lit restaurant portion, with interesting music videos playing on the TV's. Server was great, and fast, but they ran out of Coke for my friend and the Belgian White Ale I originally ordered. That's not good. \n\nPizza is pretty good though, thin crust and very well done. Will have to go back and try some of their specialty pizzas or something off the menu. Table next to us was chowing down on some Calzones that looked good.
