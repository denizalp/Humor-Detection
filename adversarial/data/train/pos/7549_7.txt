I'm not a girl but if I were, I'd shop at Frances every week!  I wish someone would make a guy-like version of Frances for me, but alas I'm fine with shopping here nonetheless. \n\nFrances is a true boutique: unique, nifty finds, collectibles and lots of funky clothing & jewelry. They have some lotions & potions but the main focus is on fashion.  \n\nAt Xmas time they have an awesome assortment of funky ornaments and decor and lots of fun finds for Xmas gift giving.  \n\nA lot of what I loved about Frances moved over to Smeeks, and I'm equally happy to visit that magical candyland any day of the week. \n\nThese bad-ass boutiques are nestled into the coolest corner on Camelback & Central, right off the lightrail & docked by the new Dutch Brother's Coffee Drive-Thru joint.  If your wifey or GF wanna do Frances, there's plenty for guys at the neighboring Red Hot Robot, Stinkweeds Music Shop & HALO Body Piercing next door.\n\nWhen you need a unique, one-of-a-kind or hard-to-find gift or fabulous frock just for you -- hit up Frances and their kick-ass neighbors.
