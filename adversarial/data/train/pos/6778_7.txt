Ok ladies (and anyone from le 281 who may read this) my fianc√© is a yelp elite, and will certainly come across this review.. So I won't be sharing too many details ;) what I can say is that I came here for my bachelorette party and had an incredible time. \n\nEvery single man here is gorgeous. Bravo! \n\nThe club is clean, drinks are really good, and the employees who set up my table could not have been more accommodating. \n\nWhile (obviously) there are not pictures allowed in the club, you can get pictures with any dancer of your choice in the entry. Personal dances are affordable, and the guys really get into it. \n\nThe on stage performances were a great time, but every now and then, there was a bit of a lull. \n\nAll in all an incredible night out, worth every penny! Enjoy!
