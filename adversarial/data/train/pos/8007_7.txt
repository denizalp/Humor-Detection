On 7-27 I went to get the special $29 MM blowout. I was here 2 weeks ago for the same service. At checkout I was told my total was $59 by a rather snotty, unprofessional receptionist. I stated it should be $29 per the special,  she back peddled and said it'll be $39.99 due to the length of my hair. I advised her this was not the case last time and it is not stated in the fine print. Then she said it was due to the amount of time it took. My conformation showed 1 hour blocked. It took 1 hour. She responded by \"professionally\" rolling her eyes. It's best to inform clients of extra costs prior to beginning the service, especially since it wasn't stated in the fine print at the time. I don't mind the extra cost. I mind not being told about them beforehand and it not being stated in the fine print. I was there 2 weeks ago with the same head of hair and it was $29. Just like the special said it would be. Somehow $29 flat turned into $39.99 due to an additional $10. (I know math is hard.. especially adding) I will not be returning and will be advising everyone I know to avoid this place.\n\nUpdate:\nIn response to The Mirror Mirror Salon's response. \n\nFact- Yelp did not \"block\" my review. They removed it due to me naming your receptionist. I fixed that and reposted. \n\nFact- This is not about me being overcharged $10.99, I do not want a refund. I want to advise your customers of the way you run your business. If you feel returning money that was wrongly charged to a guest is the right thing to do, I ask that you send it to St. Jude Children's Research Hospital. You can Google their address. \n\nFact- My story, as you put it, is 100% true. I have screenshots of the booking I made on the Vagaro app, your old fine print and my not \"waist length hair\". \n\nOpinion- You need new surveillance equipment and\/or glasses. \n\nOpinion- Proof read your replies prior to hitting send\/continue. Your responses makes you look worse then you already do.
