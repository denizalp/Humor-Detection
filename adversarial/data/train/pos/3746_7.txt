Big Jack Astor's on Yonge street. There is street parking nearby, you can also park in the private lots in the area. It will be a headache to park here if you come during prime hours.\n\nOne of the better Jack Astors. There is always someone at the front to get a server to take your party to a table. The service here is more attentive than many other Jack's in high volume locations. Server checks up on you occasionally and makes sure you have everything you need.\n\nFood doesn't take long to arrive, and drinks will be on your table within 10 minutes of ordering. Very relaxed environment with dimmed lights and music playing. Jack's is one of my go to places to catch up with friends late at night, or watch a ball game.
