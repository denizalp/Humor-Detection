When there's like a 100 different topping choices, pay per ounce isn't always the best thing.  Mmmmmmm it's so good though.  Worth every cent!  \nEvery employee I've encountered has been friendly.  The place is really large with a lot of tables.  My only recommendation is to set up a few tables outside.  On a lovely Phoenix evening, enjoying froyo outside would be heavenly.\nYummmmmmmm.... I'm going to have to go there tomorrow.
