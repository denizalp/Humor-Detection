I like Hugo Boss, I own many articles of clothing that are Hugo Boss.\n\nI can't go into this store.\n\nThey pump some random candle scent into the whole thing.\n\nLet me explain something basic to you retail geniuses out there. If you want to do something that sets you apart, make sure it does not have the potential to backfire.\n\nSome people are sensitive to smell. Pumping a scent into your store, unless it's fresh-baked cookies, crepes, bacon or other delicious food item, can only potentially shoo people away.\n\nYou cater primarily to men. Why in the world would you pump in a FLORAL scent?\n\nI will never shop at a Hugo Boss outlet as long as you keep pumping this scent in. Whoever the brainiac was that thought this was a good idea should be fired.
