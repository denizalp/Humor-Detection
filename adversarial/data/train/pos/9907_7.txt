Do not live here. Fraudulent management. BRENDA claims we gave her keys (she never received keys) and ILLEGALLY entered our apartment. She then proceeded to \"throw away\" thousands of dollars of times, including sentimental, irreplaceable items from my deceased father. She is a crook and a liar. Do not move in here!!! Zero stars if I could. Disrespectful, condescending b*]%h... when SHE broke the law and damaged my property.
