In terms of this being a museum, there are some old bicycles - the most interesting ones being from 1890's or early on. I saw one early bike that uses a drive shaft instead of a chain.\n\nThe bicycles area all lined up one after another making it a bit difficult to notice which ones are more unique. \n\nThis place is more of a bike shop to buy and repair bikes then a museum. It's someone's large collection of bicycles.
