The 4th star is for being open on Sundays :D \n\nWhen you walk in, be prepared & listen up! Someone from the back of the salon will shout out \"what do you need?\" You tell them what you need, expl: mani, pedi. Then they will tell you where to go \"pick your color and sit there (pointing at a seat)\". You will only get this instruction once before they go back to their current customer, so pay attention! Just kidding, lol, if you ask they will repeat themselves, but for some reason that makes me nervous :D\n\nI normally get seated quickly. Everyone is pretty polite. The prices are VERY reasonable & they do a good job. Some time back there seemed to be some internal conflict happening and I got to watch some drama unfold from time to time, lol, but that all seems to have been resolved OR there's a truce on Sundays. \n\nThey will chat with you if you want to chat. I'm weird, I find it incredibly relaxing to watch them do my manicure and\/or pedicure. It's FASCINATING, lol. I become completely engrossed & lose track of time.
