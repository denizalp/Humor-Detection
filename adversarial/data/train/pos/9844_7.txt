The Healthy Home Market is one of my very favorite stores in Charlotte. I can get so much variety here! Where standard grocery chains have basmati and jasmine rice, this place has something like ten varieties, half of which I had never heard of. The same goes for anything from toothpaste to nut butter (peanut butter is not the only nut you can turn into creamy goodness). I especially love their bulk foods section, and they make tasty smoothies here.\n\nOn the downside, I rarely meet employees here who seem to have fully embraced the organic\/local\/whatnot culture, so they may not be able to delve into a conversation with you about different obscure foods they sell or such like. Their meats and produce are also not necessarily organic, especially the meat and fish have no explanation or classification at all concerning how the animals are raised. Please change that, HHM!\n\nThis is a much nicer location of this local chain than the one on Independence Blvd., which is closer for me but has no fresh meat section and is much smaller overall. I come here when I can and always leave with something that I've never tasted before - it's like a small adventure every time! :)
