Oh here is a small confession,  I am a gamer nerd, yes you read that right, I play video games, and as my 17 year old son has pointed out to me many times, most his friends parents don't play,,,I say they do, but they are super undercover about it, but not me buddy.\n\nMy gaming system, Xbox 360,  though I am new to the Xbox, been rocking Nintendo for years  I thought I would give Xbox 360 a try,, plus I was house sitting a friend's house and I played Fable 2 and man that's when I knew it would be a matter of time before I got one.\n\nGot it back in Nov, my son had been telling me we need to get Xbox live accounts and play games online, now this is a brand now concept for me, and had no idea what I need to do to make this happen.\n\nBut I knew the guys at Game Stop could help me, come to find out, all I have to do is get a wireless modem and get some wifi happening in my house and my Xbox will pick it itself, its already set and ready just waiting on me! Ok Cool!\n\nPicked up 2 12 month Xbox Live memberships for 39.99,, that's right, it's on sale, score for me! And even got a copy of Fable 2 for 3 bucks!\n\nIf you have any gaming questions or needs Game Stop has the answers!
