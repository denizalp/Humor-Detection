This is the worst experience I have ever had with a Papa Johns. The manager, Jeray(sp?) was extremely rude. I placed an order and after waiting over an hour I called to inquire about my pizza. They said they gave it to whoever was in the parking lot- not me. They then said they would send another out, which after another 25 mins I called and they said they just put the pizza in the oven. I began to tell the manager that is not how business is done and it is poor customer service, with him interjecting the whole time to cut me off and then hung up on me. I called back to get the store manager's info and he hung up on me again! Would rather eat any other pizza than deal with them again!\nSo long,\nEx-Loyal Papa Johns patron
