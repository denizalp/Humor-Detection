I have only been here once and it was on my birthday in 2008. I know, strange but the young lady that washed and flat ironed my hair did an amazing job. She has since graduated and moved on to bigger and better things I am sure, but again although I do not remember her name, she got the job done. So why only 3 stars? It took quite some time to flat iron my hair and my hair was cut shorter than what is now. I mean a really LONG time. I could have done it quicker that's for sure but it was free and the results were great. \n\nSo give the students a try. You just may be pleasantly surprised.
