I love love LOVE TACOS EL GORDO! All time favorite drunkchies in Vegas. Don't mind me stuffing my face with these delicious tacos still in my club dress and heels...\n\nThere's always a long line outside but PROTIP: that are several shorter lines inside depends on what you want, you don't have to wait in that super long line out the door. \n\nYa girl got 5 tacos and fries at once. Honestly all the tacos are my favorites, Al Pastor, Lengua, Buche, Cabeza, Tripa (omg the tripa was so good I'm drooling again). I shared a large Lengua fries with the girlfriends...People sitting next to our table were quite confused at all the orgasmic noises we were making from eating. YUM!!!\n\nWill definitely be back again and again!
