Maureen was much too forward for my tastes I didn't want to go home with someone with that much red dye in their hair. I was flattered though. The bathrooms should have had drains on the floor, because that was where every one was urinating on. Most of the patrons look like ZZ Top roadies (and I don't say that in a good way). One patron was complaining about the \"baby\" cucarachas in her ice - at least her's were babies. All things considered this is by far the best bar in Glendale AZ.
