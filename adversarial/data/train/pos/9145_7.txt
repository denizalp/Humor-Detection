Office staff all seem very friendly and so far I've had two massages and both were great (two different women) I highly recommend the tall, blonde doctor. He's very good.. And I'm not just saying that because he's cute. Don't worry folks, he's happily married (12 years) Anyway, he's got a lot of energy, which can be a little overwhelming when you just finished an hour massage, but his adjustments are very strong and right on the money. \nMassage and adjustment all for $65. Great deal. I'll definitely be back.
