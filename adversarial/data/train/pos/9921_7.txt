Warning: this \"authentic\" thai food is pre-packaged and most of their sauces and bases are manufactured in places where the food regulations aren't as stringent as US guidelines. There are liberal amounts of MSG in their food too. I asked the server if I could get something without MSG and he said, \"ok, we won't add any extra to your dish.\" what?? I don't want any to begin with. The server then explained that the pre-packaged sauces come with MSG in it. The he followed up with \"well, there's not too much in there.\" I doubt it, and he was becoming visibly frustrated that I was insistant that something on their menu had to be actually made from scratch, and not reheated or reconstituted. \n\nI've had much better Thai food, the food here is nothing special. think it's a shame that all these Yelpers are reviewing how great this food is when it's pre-made and flavor-enhanced with Monosodium Glutamate. Sure you save a few bucks by not eating on the strip, but you exchange a slice of your health and soul in the process. Enjoy the chemicals, sheeple.
