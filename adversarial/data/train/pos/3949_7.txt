I created a Yelp account specifically for the purpose of leaving this review.  This review doesn't reflect the attitude of our server (she was very nice), but does reflect the judgment of the restaurant's management as a whole.  The staff at the front was not friendly.  The bus boys are clearly hurried to move people in and out of the restaurant (i.e. they tried to remove a plate which still had a large portion of the entr√©e on it no more than 5 minutes after it was delivered), they removed the plates and placemats of the guests who were done eating before many of the other guests were even close to finishing their meals, one of our guests ordered a filet medium and it came out raw (this in itself would not be a problem except the took back the raw part recooked it so the outside was like charcoal and failed to get the center more than medium rare), and the list goes on and on.  I disliked this meal enough to take the time to create a Yelp account and leave multiple great reviews for other businesses in an effort to clearly show how awful our experience was.  I would strongly suggest taking the $300-400 you would spend for a party of four at a comparable restaurant and heading down to Mastros City Hall.
