Yellowtail remains one of the top modern Japanese restaurants on the Strip.\n\nThe food here is inventive with bold flavors.  Stay adventerious when ordering; you will be rewarded.\n\nThe majority of the dishes are made to be shared (although the portions are not too large that those dining alone will not have a decent selection).  \n\nThe tai (snapper) served sashimi style with EVOO and shiso is excellent.  The peppery edge of the oil enhances the sweetness of the fish.  The lobster carpaccio is amazing.  The sweetness of the lobster and the onion play off each other beautifully and offers the perfect textural contrast.  Finally, the kobe beef tataki is an absolute must try.  Roll up the paper thin slice around a sliver of garlic and spicy diakon pickle and pop it in your mouth.  It's amazing how the bold flavor of the garlic is washed away by the fat of the beef as it melt in your mouth.\n\nFor warm plates, top props to the \"Seafood Dynamite\".  Lightly broiled king crab and rock shrimp dressed in a spicy yet not cloying citrus aioli; delicious.\n\nThe nigiri sushi is all very high quality but boring when compared to the inventive speciality rolls.  The \"Popping Spicy Crab\" is a serious must try.  Crab, spicy aioli, cucumber, asparagus, and POP ROCKS!  Just try it.\n\nService is excellent.\n\nThe wine \/ sake list is very good with well chosen selections by the glass.  Prices are high (remember, you're at the Bellagio).\n\nHighly Recommended.
