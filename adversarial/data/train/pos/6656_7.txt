I'll give a basic negative\/positive review \n\nPositive - the team - cheerful, friendly , at tentative, knowledgeable, courteous, helpful and genuine \n\nNegative- no cutlery (I know this is the point however I'd like something to help dig out the meat from the lobster\/crab claws\n\nPositive - price was in my opinion very reasonable\nFor the amount you get \n\nNegative - sides should be that ..... On the Side, not stuck in the bag with your seafood, I wasn't aware this came in such a way\n\nPositive - being able to get messy with your hands and no one looking at you disapprovingly as they are all digging in \n\nNegative - from the menu you don't get a sense of how much food you will be getting so you're not sure how much to order especially on the sides \n\nPositives - decor is nice inside, clean and have a handy washing station to clean you're messed up face \n\nI do want to go back to the team for this location as for me it was the best part of the experience ..... Everyone of them were so happy to be serving you it really made the evening worth the money before you get to the food, which for me was delightful however my partner dos thing the sauce was lacking a little flavour on her choice
