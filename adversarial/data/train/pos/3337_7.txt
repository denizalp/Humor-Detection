5+ stars for our server Maria! She was really genuinely kind. Remind me of a motherly-figured. \n\n- She brought out soup for my friend and saw that she didn't already have her napkin towel on her laps yet so she kindly did it for her. \n- spoke to us very kindly, respectful\n- followed up literally on everything she recommended. \n- great recommendations (my favorite is chicken pot pie!!!!! I always get this in Vegas)\n- our drinks were never empty \n- reminded us at the end to have a great day, and to have lots of fun!\n- etc....\n\nPalazzo is lucky to have her!
