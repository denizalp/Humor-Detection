Stumbled on this place entirely by accident, and it was a good time! Tasty burger and fries (had to try the Zack's Special) for cheap. My husband had the fried chicken, which he wasn't terribly impressed with- but I guess that's what you should expect ordering chicken from a burger joint. I wouldn't say this is the best burger in Charlotte (I'll save that distinction for the Penguin), but it's still pretty darned good- and the place has a cool classic dive feel to it.\n\nDefinitely worth a visit if you're in the neighborhood. I'd happily go again!
