I am a big CDS show, but after watching this show, I was VERY DISAPPOINTED. We walked out of the show and try to asked for refund, to no avail. I tried. I didn't pay $$$ to see SAD CLOWNS making up words the entire show. Sadly, that's what we got.\n\nI was almost waiting for 3 XXX BUZZ to lit up! Thinking I was at AGT audition show. I was looking for Howard Stern To hit his buzzer!!!\n\n2 mins mediocre act... Curtain close. 5 mins sadly clowns filler show. Begging for an applause that never came. \n\nAfter half hour of the show, I've seen people walking out... They must have been thinking, I'd rather waste money at the slot machine than spend another excruciating minute watching this variety show. \n\nIt was a GIGANTIC LET DOWN for CDS company... I can't believe how terrible it is. \nThe two wheels... COME ON!!! If I wanted to see that for 15 mins. I could have gotten more adrenalin rush watching guinea pigs inside their wheels. The flying trapeze? THe band have to replay the chords pertinent to the act, they couldn't start on queue one of them couldn't get the swing in place. I mean , these performers are amazing. Very talented. BUT THE CHOREOGRAPHER and whoever put the show together?!?? Is another thing...\n\nSo THIS IS MY PSA: save your hard ear $$$$ and go to a Celine concert!!! At least that's what I wished I purchased ... But I got this ticket instead.... I need therapy from the mediocrity of this show. CDS is nothing but mediocre but for this SHOW... They show the rest of us, that they are capable of producing a laughable show., not in a positive note kinda way. \n\nI will try AMEX! See if I can get a REFUND!!!\n\nDon't say, me and few of us ,YELPERS  didn't warn you. \n\nPEACE LOVE AND SKIP ZARKANA!!!
