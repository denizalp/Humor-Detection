I don't understand everyone else's dislike of this place. I've ordered to-go and delivery from this establishment for two years and have never had an issue. Food is good, prices are reasonable and customer service has always been perfect. \n\nIt's family owned and operated and they are all very friendly. My family complains that there's too much sauce but I informed them that most people enjoy putting that on their plain rice and they haven't complained since. I love their chicken curry, mongolian beef, fried rice, lo mein, general chicken...basically everything. Delivery is always on time and whenever I've called in to pick up an order it is ready when I get there!
