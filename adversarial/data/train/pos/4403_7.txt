This place has some really cute stuff but it's so snotty you would think you accidentally drove to Beachwood. I don't like leaving bad reviews unless I feel like I have given something a fair shot, but at this store, the staff are never friendly, and I've been in at least four times now over the course of months. I should be this store's target: young professional woman who likes eclectic and pretty clothes and housewares. But the staff really ruins it--I think their favorite thing to do is stand behind the register looking bored or too cool for everyone, while eyeing you down...it's pretty lame. And it's too bad because they do have a well-edited store but it's not worth the attitude. Not to mention the price point; this is Cleveland, not New York. I get that you're a boutique but really?  \n\nThey might have some nice stuff but let's be real, it's still just a magazine rack, and still just a candle, even if it is made from 100% organic free trade soy smells-like-heaven rarest flowers on earth in the remote rainforest discovered by natives and revered for its healing capabilities from a single burn. It's a candle, it shouldn't cost the same as an entree at Lola even if it is the best candle you've ever had. Only Oprah should burn $40 candles. I keep wanting to like this place but so far it's not working.
