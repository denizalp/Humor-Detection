how does this place stay in business? who pays these prices?  This place must be a front for some nefarious operation, nothing else makes sense.\n\nalso, I called for 3 days looking for a certain metal yard item, no one ever answered the phone, for 3 days!  then I go there today and met one of THE most unfriendly, unhelpful employees.\n\nnever again, bye!
