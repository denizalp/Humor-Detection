Oh my gosh, best Filipino Food in Arizona I've had so far! I've tried a number of Filipino restaurants from Mesa to Glendale and Manila Sunrise was hands down THE BEST. No offense Arizona but this is the first Filipino restaurant that was as good as California. First of all the service was amazing! I felt like the staff was my Tita's (auntie) house and she was taking care of us like we were her relatives. I didn't catch her name but she was so cute in her chef's hat and she was super sassy, I love it. The food, oh my god, the food was amazing. I have been craving Filipino food for a while now, so I decided to go all out for this particular lunch. I ordered us the crispy pata, which is a traditional dish that is basically the best ever invented. If you like lechon, which is the roasted pig, this is the way to go. It was cooked to perfection with the crispiest skin and most tender meat. This was the husband first time eating crispy pata and it had him (and me) tearing it apart for every last bit of meat. Since that took about 20 minutes to cook (so worth it) we decided to share a combo plate while we waited. We got the fish sinigang and kare kare- I must say both were extremely delicious, but I'd say the kare kare stood out over the sinigang. Sinigang is a tamarind based soup, so it's sour (in the best way) and kare kare is a special stew with a peanut based sauce that is to die for with some rice and bagaon (shrimp paste). Randomly, I ran into my brother and some of his friends here, so I expect to see some familiar Filipino faces everytime I come back. I can't wait! I love Manila Sunrise! Makes me feel like I'm home.
