Ramen! Delicious, delicious ramen!\n\nI came to the Yelp page for Goro and Gun today to book a reservation and realized that I have not yet reviewed my favorite ramen place?!?! I have tried a few of the available ramen bowls (all with the option of the gluten free noodles which are amazing) and I believe the miso kimchi ramen is the best. Obviously characterized by the kimchi flavor, this ramen bowl is very full of other flavors as well. The portions are large and filling so it ends up being a reasonable price ($14) for lunch. The lamb ramen bowl is also very popular if you love the taste of lamb which dominates the taste of that bowl. Overall, the place is laid back but still has nice d√©cor with great service. They also have a nice selection of sakes, sodas, and teas. I recommend the genmaicha as it is my favorite. Also the pork is amazing and I am always tempted to order extra (even though then I can't eat the whole bowl).\n\nGoro and Gun is the place to go for gluten free ramen!
