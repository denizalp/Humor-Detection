Wow, great service at an office supply store!\n\nI had to drop in to pick up a few things for work on my way home today. I was in the middle of a phone call with a parent that I couldn't get off of, so I was that asshole in the store on my cell phone.\n\nAs I was trying to talk to a parent and find my items. A super nice guy that worked there asked me if I needed help. I asked my caller to hold on a sec, asked him where the item I was hopelessly looking for was. I apologized for not getting off my phone to speak to him, which would have been the polite thing to do. He said nobody had ever apologized for being on the phone while talking to him at the store. I gave me mom credit for teaching me to be considerate. When I am rude I give my dad credit. ;)\n\nAs I picked up the new items and juggled the ones I already had, I commented I should have gotten a basket. He said no problem, he'd take the items up front and have them waiting for me when I was ready to check out! What?? Great customer service, wooohooo! \n\nI finished my shopping and my call and went up to the checkout. He was super nice at the check out and even joked around with me.\n\nI've always had decent experiences at Office Max, but this was downright great. Is the world becoming a better place??
