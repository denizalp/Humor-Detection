Ouzeri\n\nA solid OmNom!  A SOLID Winterlicious lunch menu.  I've stopped going to Winterlicious pretty much because most restaurants really alter their menu and the service is just plain awful.  Why lure people in there only to give them something they're not expecting?  \n\nOuzeri on the other hand was fantastic.  We did go off hours at 3pm for their lunch prix fix so not sure how they handle a regular service.  The Meze dip sampler was awesome.  Two Pita breads with enough dip that after I shared there was still enough for another two pitas!\n\nI couldn't resist the grilled Kalamari even though the Lamb Pie sounded awesome.  It was cooked to perfection and couldn't ask for more.\n\nI was going to get the custard for desert but got talked in to the Greek Yogurt.  It was nice, but a bit too tart for me however everyone else enjoyed it.  It was super thick, and the honey nutty yummy goodness that went with it was awesome.\n\nLooking forward to going back soon.
