This was a ridiculous experience from start to finish. And the only reason they get the third star is because we had absolutely the most fantastic adorable and aware cocktail waitress.  We went for Skrillex, who rocked!! And the cirque theme is suuuuuper fun and unique.  \nHowever, the hosts are a bunch of professional scammers who take tips and tell you they will help you get a good deal on a table when they actually never do anything close to helping.  \nAnd the club is full of cheap scandalous hoes who will loiter around table and then try to grab drinks off the table and run.
