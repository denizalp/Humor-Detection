I was hesitant to try The Chili Man's Choice because the mustard on it is \"The Carolina Reaper Madness\". To me that sounded like something out of an episode of fear factor, but between Vic's charm and a friend of mine who is a regular, I folded. I'm a sucker for mustard. Oh man! This mustard has just enough of the pepper to put a spring in your step. The magical chili mingled with that and the perfectly cooked hotdog and the toasted bun had me hooked and wanting to get back in line for a second one, only I had a Mac & Cheese Chili dog waiting for me.\n\nI have a weakness for mustard but nothing compares to my compulsion for ordering Mac and Cheese. OH MAN! I was not disappointed.\nThis Chili guy must be some kind of wizard. He ruined all other dogs for me with just those two. I can't wait until he's back in the spring for me to try more.
