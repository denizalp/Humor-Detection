My wife and I were there for a 10am film. At 10:10 I went to the snack counter and advised the young lady behind the counter that the film had not started yet. At 10:20 someone came into the theatre and from the back of the room announced that due to a fire alarm before the place opened, the film was starting late. NO KIDDING !\n\nNo sooner the \"managerial\" person left, the movie started. But alas no volume. Again a person came in and announced that \"they were working on the problem\". AGAIN NO KIDDING !\n\nSo the movie actually started 45 minutes late. We were offered movie passes as compensation. Thank you, I am sure my wife and I will use them one day. But being that this is Las Vegas, there are other options for places to go when seeing a movie. NO KIDDING !
