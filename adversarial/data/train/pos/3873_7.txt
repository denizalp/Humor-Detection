Wow.  It pains me to write this update.  I've been a (good!) customer of In the Kitchen since it was located in Wexford.  I've spent plenty of bucks on stuff I needed (and really didn't actually NEED) for me.  I've spent plenty of money on gifts for friends and for shower gifts.  Since the store has been in the Strip District I've trudged happily over to spend lunches browsing and buying the aisles and frequently accompanied by friends who spent their own bucks there.\n\nAnd then.  I bought a Living Social Deal.  On yet another lunch hour spent in the store, I selected a knife and went to check out with my LS certificate.  The clerk looked at the knife and the deal and told me it wasn't good on knives.  Hmmm.  I looked - again - at the certificate.  Nope, no mention of not being good on knives.  \"Oh.  Well, it's not good on sale items.\"  Another perusal of the certificate.  Hmmm...no mention of not being good on sale items.  The clerk then said she'd need to get the owner.  \n\nThe owner came out - the formerly charming, lovely individual I'd chatted up many times over the years discussing quality, technique, suggested brands.  Quite a different demeanor this time, unfortunately.  She said they couldn't honor the deal on a sale item because it cut into their profit.  Really?  I understand wanting to stay in the black.  But the deal is the deal....you can't write your own rules after the fact.  \n\nI took my Living Social deal, left the knife behind and promptly called Living Social when I got back to the office.  They were not pleased.  In the Kitchen violated the terms of usage.  My purchase price of the deal was refunded and In the Kitchen lost a previously loyal customer.  \n\nA side note:  ironically, I'm the Duchess of In the Kitchen....anyone who'd like that \"title\" can have it!
