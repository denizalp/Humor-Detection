this place was voted one of the best ribs by blogTO but trust me it is NOT one of the best.  I had the st. louis ribs with a side of their purple slaw.  first of all the purple slaw had NO taste.  they drizzled a ton of oil on it and then maybe a bittt of balsamic.  I basically didn't eat it, and that is a very RARE thing for me.  \n\nso now about the ribs.  While they certainly are not bad, they are NOT the best i've had.  So maybe I am being a bit harsh, but only because I had such high expectations.  They were not even totally fall off the bone and the bbq sauce was lacking.  The best part was the seared fatty top part but the meaty part in between was almost bland and bit dry.  def not worth $30.\n\nBut what truly gives this place 1 star the management.  They were out of SOO many things on the menu.  The main being the baby back ribs, THE CORNBREAD (seriously?!?!), brisket, and literally at least 5 other things.  please keep in mind this was a weekday at 7pm seating.  the night has just started and your missing very core parts of your menu and legit at least a 3rd of your menu is gone.   the WORST management by a restaurant I have ever encountered in my life.  OO and to add, they list desserts on their menu.  BUT they do not have ANY of the desserts.  The waitress told us that the manager actually puts stuff on the menu that they don't have because they MIGHT get it in the future.  do not give your money to these liars.
