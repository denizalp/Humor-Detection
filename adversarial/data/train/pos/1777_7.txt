I'm still trying to investigate what exactly made me sick after eating dinner here Sunday night. I felt fine arriving in and then went through with dinner. \nI ordered the Rib Eye, cooked medium rare with my two sides being rice pilaf and roasted veggies. For my started I had baked potato cream soup. Half way through dinner I started feeling nauseous and slowly lost my appetite. I had at least half of my steak, but then felt like I hit a wall and was done. \nDon't get me wrong, the steak was perfectly cooked, but it seemed like everything I ate was super salty! \n\nIt wasn't until the next morning I felt really sick. I'm not talking 'bout hangover sick (because I didn't have any alchie bevies at dinner) but this was a different kinda sick that I wasn't familiar with before. Needless to say, I spent all yesterday morning with the porcelain king, and the only thing I can think of I got sick from the dinner from Claim Jumper. \n\nJust be careful eating here.
