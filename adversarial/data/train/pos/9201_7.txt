Yes, yes, I am giving a restaurant with a drive through five stars!\n\nFilibertos, my guilty pleasure.. I'm a slave to the carne asada fries!! They always have such big portions and yummy helpings of sour cream, avocados, cheese and salsa!\n\nI will not eat breakfast or dinner just to pig out on this glorious place for lunch! Almost everything on the menu is guaranteed to be good.. let me re-phrase that to \"so darn good you will toss and turn in your sleep from guilt!\". \n\nI would also highly recommend their rolled taquitos, yummy! \n\nWarning: This place is very dangerous because of the fact that it has a drive through and is very easy access food. Thoughts of Filibertos throughout the day and the temptation of the drive through will haunt you!! lol :)\n\n5 stars!! :D
