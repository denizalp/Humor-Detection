Heck yeah!\nTalk about the system working!\nProps to Matt who started the awesome thread on Yelp Madison Talk re: openings and closings (http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/topic\/madison-the-official-2013-madison-openings-and-closings-comings-and-goings-thread) and thanks to Steve for letting the community know about this new Indian joint on Junction Rd. (It may have taken me a few months to get her otherwise!) I was bouncing around the threads last night, saw \"Indian\" and got in the car. (I called on my way to make sure they were actually open.)\n\nFolks, this is easily the best Indian food I've found in Madison for three reasons:\n\n1. The Menu... holy cow, IT'S HUGE! I went for dinner and spent forever pouring over each and every page, looking up a few items on my phone because they were new to me. No shortage of variety here.   \n\n2. The Dosas... this and this alone should make you speed over. I think they have 15! That's nuts... NUTS! I'm used to seeing maybe 3 or 4 different kinds at a place.\n\n3. The Flavor... everything I tried was incredible. And although spice\/heat is key to Indian cooking, theirs is well balanced, and not so hot that you can't taste anything. \n\nI had vegetable jalfrezi, chicken tikka masala, masala dosa and garlic naan. All of it was awesome! (GET THESE THINGS!) Even the garlic naan, which I sort of feel like is tough to make incredible, but it was incredible. It arrived at the table piping hot and aromatic and didn't have an offensive garlic flavor. The chicken tikka masala was some of the best I've had, topping some of the curry I long for in London. The veggies were tender yet crisp and in a super tasty sauce. And the dosa. Ohhhh the dosa. It was good, not my favorite, but with so many options, I can't wait to get back and try another one... maybe more adventurous than this one. \n\nHuge props to the stellar staff that made sure we had no questions about the menu, kept water glasses full, and told us they will have beer\/wine\/liquor soon. (Just wrapping up some paperwork.) They also sent us home with leftovers in boxes and gave us extra rice. Very kind. \n\nThe atmosphere ain't much, so don't go expecting to be transported to India or anything. There is some nice stuff hand painted on one wall, but that's about it. Small space. Bright light. No tunes playing the night I was there. I didn't notice construction dirt or dust so I'm guessing they cleaned up after what sounds like a rushed opening. And my feeling has always been, if I'm there the first week, I'm going to make a few exceptions anyway knowing they're still trying to find their footing. These guys have though. And if food remains consistent, this will be my go to for Indian stuffs in Madison!
