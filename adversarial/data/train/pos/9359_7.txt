Everybody told me... \"You need to check out Momofuku.\" Uh huh. Not really my thing, I thought. Went here on a business trip and... totally my thing. Cool layout. Good food. The Shishito Peppers... oh f*ck.  Loved the Rotisserie Jidori Chicken, as well. The Old Fashioned they served... honestly one of the best I've had. Definitely going back here next time.
