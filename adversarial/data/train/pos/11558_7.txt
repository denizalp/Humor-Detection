Her name is Rio, and she... well, she used to do a lot more.\n\nTold friends we were staying at the Rio and comments ranged from \"I heard that was a great place to stay a long time ago\", to \"aren't they going to close the Rio?\", to \"why?\"\n\nFlash back with me to 1990.  I heard nothing but people visiting Vegas talk about the VooDoo Lounge, on the 51st floor, the shocking cocktail waitress outfits here, the amazing huge suites, and the masquerade in the sky carnival show.\n\nWell, the VooDoo lounge is not as exclusive, trendy, or fancy as it used to be, but it's not trying to be.  Still cannot beat that view at night.  It can get windy, but it's amazing.\n\nThe shocking cocktail waitress thongs have been covered up, as trends do, although the lacy negligee black lace outfits are still very sexy.  The suites were nothing if you've stayed at the Venetian, or in a suite at Caesar's Palace, but it did look like the bathrooms had been remodeled, as they were in modern granite, and very very, like superbly clean.  Not a speck or indication of use anywhere.  \n\nSpeaking of bathrooms, the ones here have a strange square window portal where you can see right in.  Not sure who came up with that bright idea, but it skeeved me out to think people visiting could see me on the potty or in the shower.  Anyway.  \n\nCheck in was a breeze, even though there was a line.  There are so many deals that even the front desk was confused.  Ours, booked through the hotel's specials page, included two 24 hour buffet wristbands, for two days, for two people.  \n\nAnd use those wristbands we did, eating four meals a day.  The buffet here (the regular one, not the seafood one, which we did not try) is amazing, especially the mongolian bbq\/teppanyaki stations.  Lots of fresh cut vegetables, and a little of everything - sushi, italian, chinese, salad bar, etc.  \n\nEverything except the Palms is a major hike from here.  There is a shuttered strip club across from the Rio, which is funny to look at.  I imagine there are cobwebs covered with glitter inside.  \n\nThe outside of the building has peeling glass film, which is U-G-L-Y.  They need to renovate that.  \n\nAnd, as others have mentioned, the Masquerade in the Sky has gone to that big place in the sky where floats and showgirls dwell, long ago -- it is no longer. \n\nThey do have some of the cocktail servers get up on platforms near the slot machines and dance.  I think they do that some other places, and it's strange, but also a welcome vibe among the quiet seniors pulling slot handles.\n\nAmazingly, the pool here is fantastic.  Actually four pools, one of which is adult... I mean \"European\"... I mean topless or whatever the euphemism is these days.  It is basically \"toptional\", so no kids, and whether you wear a top or not is up to you.  \n\nEnjoyed the shuttle to the other Caesar's properties, including Bally's, Paris Las Vegas, Harrah's, and Caesar's Palace.  That saved a lot of driving or taxicab fare. \n\nWiFi is included in your resort fee, but is for ONE device.  So if you connect your tablet, forget your computer or phone.  Ice buckets worked fine, and housekeeping was on it with extra towels and other items needed.  \n\nTwo towers here, the Masquerade tower, where we stayed, and I think the Carnival Tower, which is a little closer.  Masquerade tower is a slight walk, but not too bad.  Burger King Bar (which was not visited) and the Chippendale's show are on this tower's side.  \n\nWe did see Penn and Teller, which was packed, even though parts of it was the same show I saw 10 plus years ago.  But it was a great great show nonetheless. \n\nThe best part was the view of the lightning, thunderstorms, and lights of las vegas from our room on the 31st floor.
