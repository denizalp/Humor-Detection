I was very worried of what to expect coming here because I only paid $90 for the room.  But to my surprise, our room was really nice!  We had a great view of the strip, large bath tub, king bed, classy and clean decor.  What a deal right?!  I thought everything was going good until the next morning my boyfriend told me that about 2:00AM  one of the employees or so he thinks let herself into our room!  She opened the door with a key and my boyfriend ran out of bed and yelled THE HELL ARE YOU DOING??!  She mumbled something and left,  and then my boyfriend went back to sleep!  You would think he would flag her down, but noooo.  I'm a super heavy sleeper so I didn't hear a thing or else I would have thrown a big deal with her.  I complained to the front desk and all they said was that they would look into it and do a lockdown of our room.  Well nothing became of that.  First off we dont even know if it was an employee because what employee opens someones room at 2:00AM?!  It could have been some crazy person with a key to our room who could have stolen our belongings!  The whole thing just pissed me off.  \n\nSO TI gets 2 stars! And whoever opened our room at 2:00AM was damn lucky that I was asleep because I totally would have made a SCENE!!
