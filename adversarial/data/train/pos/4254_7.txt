I will never return. I placed a phone order a few minutes after 8pm before driving out of the Douglas airport parking lot. I headed straight for Concord, and when I got there decided to run into Walmart for a few items. By the time I arrived at the restaurant, it was almost 8:40pm. I sat at the bar and was told to wait a few minutes. I did not get my food until after 9:30pm. The bartender kept apologizing and offered me a drink for my wait. I declined, I was just so miffed about waiting all that time. Ridiculous! \n\nI have a feeling they did not make my order until I got to the restaurant to pick it up! If I was told this I would've left after telling them forget it. I will never return to this Red a Lobster again. After getting my full of those delicious biscuits (which is what lured me there in the first place) I won't be back to any of them ever again!\n\nOkay, I will, but just to get some cheddar biscuits.
