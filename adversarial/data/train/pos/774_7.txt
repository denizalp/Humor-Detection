Watam is Hum Watan if you know what mean! its freaking great. I love the chapli kebabs I get them every time I go. \n\nThe meals are great for the price you would pay as you always will have to take some home, the portions are big. With the diner meal you get rice, naan, meat you order, salad and 2 sauces (white and red).\n\nThe restaurant is not bad as there is far bit amount of tables for people to sit around and is not cramped. It's part of a plaza so there is plenty of parking available.
