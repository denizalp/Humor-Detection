I was there celebrating a friend's birthday plus it was also opening (TIFF) Toronto Film Festival weekend. \n\nYorkville was a complete buzz that Saturday night. With literally no tables to be found anywhere. People were stopped on the sidewalk trying to catch glimpses of celebrities or just gawking at the many exotics cars that lined the street that evening.\n\nWe had fortunately had a guest list setup at Club V after we finished up dinner at Ciao Wine Bar.\n\nLet me tell you I had a fantastic time with friends here on Sat night right from the get go There was no attitude from the hostess or security at the door. \n\nCool vibe from the people there too. Not too packed. Music was party mix r&b pop.. that will make you jump, jump, :)  The MC talked into the crowd which was cool and interactive. He gave some shout outs to those celebrating their special days.. . \n\nJager shots were pricey at $9 each but they were served ice cold from a special dispenser.. that's different.\n\nThere's an open air smoking patio bar that was closed off. I didn't even know it was open to the air until I looked up and saw some exposed beams. Very trick. \n\nAlso they have a shooter bar. The bartender was lighting up flames.. it was a sight to see. Prices of shooters were reasonable starting at $4\n\nWill be going back in the future and I hope it wasn't just a fluke. :)\n\nI just knocked off one star on the review because a friend went to get some air and they didn't let him back into the club??  good it wasn't him that was celebrating his birthday because that would majorly suck..
