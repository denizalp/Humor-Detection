Unfortunately, the bartenders scammed my friends and I on drinks. I ordered a long island ice tea for $17 and I watched the bartender make the drink without any alcohol... he literally only put chasers and a large amount of ice in it. I tasted it after he charged my card and there was absolutely no alcohol in it. I then had to ask him to put alcohol in it and he rolled his eyes and only put half a shot of vodka in it... needless to say the rum and coke he gave me also had no rum in it and that cost $11 not including tip. In total, I spent around $28 for chasers... I definitely do not recommend going here.
