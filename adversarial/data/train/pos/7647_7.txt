Betty's burgers are bad a**. Hands down the best burger I have had in a long time. \n\nWalnut Wednesday is food truck day at work. Normally I am not a burger type guy. Not that I don't enjoy a good burger, just that it is hard to find a worthy one to really enjoy. \n\nEnjoy it I did. I got the Boomerang. Beef patty, brisket, kraut, thousand island and a few other things. Awesome combo. It was like having a Reuben on steroids. \n\nYou pay nine bucks for a burger everywhere downtown. But this on is worth every penny.
