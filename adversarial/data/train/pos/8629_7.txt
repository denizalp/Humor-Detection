I visited this place twice during my trip to Vegas. This Evel Knievel themed pizza joint is a block across from Freemont Street Experience. They're also open til 4am on the weekends so its a perfect place to grab a quick bite after a night out. Bonus, they have a full liquor bar :)\n\nEach slice was around 5 bucks. The prepped pies were displayed to the right of the bar and servers will gladly describe each concoction. The pie selections vary but the ones I ordered both nights were delicious and had nice crunch from the toasted dough.\n\nYou can order at the bar, sit down tables or from the sidewalk window. Don't get intimidated by the rocker atmosphere. The staff is very friendly and bartenders make good cocktails too.
