From GREAT to REALLY BAD in three quick visits.\n\n2nd Visit:\n\nLast week I ordered the Egg Benedict and the english muffin was ROCK HARD. Like \"chip your tooth\" hard. How this got put on a plate is beyond me! Completely in-edible. The service was soo bad I never had the chance to talk to a server, I just paid and left.\n\n3rd Visit:\n\nBut that English Muffin was nothing compared to yesterday morning's breakfast sandwich which was tasty as all get out ... only one problem. \n\nI SERIOUSLY NEARLY DIED AFTER EATING IT!! I HAVE NEVER BEEN THIS SICK IN MY ENTIRE LIFE!!!! \n\nI've never had food poisoning ... Hell, I'd never gotten sick from eating anything, anywhere. But yesterday I woke up, got dressed and walked to Scratch (I did nothing else). By the time I walked home I was doubled over in SEVERE pain. I laid in bed for the entire day. I really should have gone to the hospital, it was that bad. Instead I was writhing in pain for EIGHT HOURS until I started puking up that breakfast sandwich. Two hours of puking it up, I was \"stable\". Naturally this is typical, but it was my experience.\n\nAnd now, all that I can think of is how lucky that couple was, whom after 20mins of being ignored by the staff, they just up and left without ordering (this is COMMON! THEY ARE DREADFULLY UNDERSTAFFED!!!!!). The servers are great ... just nowhere near enough of them! It's a complete fail! And it's been happening regularly ever since they opened a few weeks ago!\n\n\n1st Vist:\n\nLocated on 5th Street and Roosevelt right smack dab in the middle of the Arts District.  \n\nOutdoor seating\/patio with a great view of Downtown.\n\nThe dinning room has table and barstool seating with an ultra modern motif.\n\nAnd I just had the best omelet in my life. \nNot kidding.\nMy drip coffee was hot, strong and smooth (I loved it).
