White gourd green tea!!  \n\nHot or cold I'm hooked. 30% sugar. \nMy absolute favorite spot for boba in Vegas. You can adjust the sugar levels to your liking and they will happily remake it for you if you aren't satisfied. The service is amazing. The boba is chewy as boba should be but not mushy at all. If you aren't into boba you can add other toppings as well. \n\nGreat spot to hangout with friends.
