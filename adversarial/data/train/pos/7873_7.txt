A lunch companion and I visited Garcias this afternoon for a quick lunch.  As we entered the restaurant  we were greeted and seated immediately. The decor in Garcias is warm and inviting with its Spanish architecture, paint, tiles and Mexican music in the background. \n\nAs we were seated our chips, salsa,  and drinks arrived almost immediately.  The chips are served hot with chunky red salsa and a refried bean dip. The chips are hot, very thin, crispy and salted perfectly and the bean dip is delicious.\n\nThe menu at Garcias has a good variety of entrees, all reasonably priced for a full service establishment. The staff at Garcias are friendly without being intrusive.  The food is delivered quickly, hot, and plated attractively with generous servings. \n\nMy lunch companion and I both had the burrito fundido which was probably one of the best I've had. Each entr√©e  comes with typical rice and refried beans with a little lettuce and tomato.\n\nFor dessert we had the fried ice cream which is quite good. One large scoop of vanilla ice cream that has been fried on top of a cinnamon honey crunchy tortilla with whip cream.\n\nWe enjoyed a delicious lunch at a very reasonable price.  If you're ever in the neighborhood give Garcias a try, you won't be disappointed.
