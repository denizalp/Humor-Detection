This is a review for the hotel's entertainment offering rather than the hotel rooms... I've never stayed here but definitely enjoyed visiting!\n\nFor the kids (loved it when I was little): an awesome arcade where you can win prizes and a crazy \"climb the ladder\" game where you can win a huge stuffed animal or fall *splat* onto a big bouncy cushion.\n\nFor the young adults: The fun club, Orange (I think is the name?), with a great dj, strong drinks, and a cool outdoor area.\n\nFor the older family: The crazy \"Senior Frogs\"-style bar where you can watch the bartender swirl tequila bottles followed by free shots for all... (also a good pre-game for the club)\n\nFor everyone: The outdoor pirate show!
