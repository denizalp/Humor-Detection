come on. this place is what it is. a place to sleep in las vegas. now i must say, that i don't advise staying there for 10 days while on business...\n\nunless you love barry mantilow..\n\nand star trek....\n\nand hookers.\n\nand i only like ONE of those things, so i didn't really have that great of a time!
