I love this small airport! Organized, clean, easy to navigate and plenty of rocking chairs throughout to sit and relax.\n\nThe Atrium is wonderfully well thought out and gives it a spacious feel.\n\nAirport staff I have encountered are professional, friendly and helpful.\n\nAlso glad it has a USO located on the second floor of the Atrium.
