My first meal ever in vegas a little over 5 years ago was at mr luckys, and the past two times i have been there it has been for the 9.99 all you can eat prime rib.  I absolutely not only love this deal but love how good this meal is.  I'm really picky about prime rib, but this stuff is cooked perfectly each time, comes with a side of mashed potatoes and vegetables.  Definitely order this and have no reservations about the quality of the meat.  Also, if you're at the hard rock for a concert let the waiter know.  When we told him we were their for the Kenny Chesney show he gave us a couple front of the line passes that allowed us to bypass a ridiculously long line right after dinner and enter the joint earl and get the spot we wanted for the show.
