Easily the best sandwich shop in Scottsdale!  Fresh ingredients, meat prepared IN HOUSE, fresh baked cookies daily, delicious homeade soup on the reg, and a VERY attractive and friendly staff!  \n\nYou have a choice.........you can either go to the chain sandwich shops, which have processed meats and borderline ill prepared fixings.  Or for the same price, possibly even LOWER, you can support a LOCAL MA and PA establishment that does EVERYTHING fresh and with heart.  If you love and respect yourself and your tastebuds, you'd stop going to the formulaic\/dispassionate CORPORATE run sandwich establishments(just b\/c it's easier), and you'd become a regular at a restaurant that serves food that tastes fresh and that is just OVERALL better for your health.  It's a NO BRAINER!!!!  \n\nFYI, hot sandwiches WILL take a little longer to make on account that they have to get toasted or go on a panini press; anyone with a heartbeat and\/or the ability to produce saliva UNDERSTANDS this.  Yet, I've been in the restaurant when a few of the more vapid customers failed to comprehend this basic principle of Science, and they throw a public tantrum as a result.  If you're in a hurry..... PHONE AHEAD OF TIME.  They DELIVER as well.\n\nI'm living in CO now, and will sure miss this place.  However, you can bet your bippy I'll return WHENEVER I'm back in the area.
