Just think of it as a character building exercise. Remain calm. Find your happy place. Deep breaths. Everything will be fine. Why so Zen? Because the Frontier counter is a gaggle mish-mash of lines, kiosks, and crisscrossing paths. Maybe they are just mentally preparing you for the rest of your Frontier experience. The flight must be better than this, right?\n\nUnfortunately, my experience with Frontier is that it usually isn't. Only slightly better than the mythical AirYak, but not much. Seems like every flight something goes wrong. Usually causing huge delays. Fortunately for their investors, not all their customers have a choice in airlines. Cheap is cheap and sometimes cheap wins the debate. \n\nMy recommendation to Frontier? Embrace the folly. Have fun with it. \"Never on time, never a pleasure, but for this price, be happy we get you there at all.\"
