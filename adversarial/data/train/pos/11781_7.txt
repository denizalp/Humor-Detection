I could not be more than happier with McKenna Property Management. They have been managing 2 of my homes  for the past 5 years and doing business with them is as good as it gets.  \nThey have very professional and courteous staff with positive work attitude. Whenever I called the office my call never went to voicemail and person answering it could not be more pleasant than they are, this was not the case with other mgmt. companies.  \nOn initial meeting I met with the owner Jenni McKenna at the  property and she explained me in details how the process works and the way they handle my property and future tenants that will be living there. She is super easy to work with, extremely pleasant and one of the best people I have ever encountered in real estate field.\nNicole handled screening of potential tenants and kept me updated when we found suitable ones for my property and Kyara and Elonda handled all the small issues and repairs that came along. Debbie did fabulous job when the first tenants were moving out and making sure they leave the place in same condition as they received it. \nI very much enjoy them handling everything, after all that is why I hired them at the first place, they do the managing and I stay headache free :)  \nIn property management business I found it is very hard to find company that is 100% dedicated to management, most of the other companies that I interviewed can not even compare to McKenna Property Management, Jenni is just light years ahead of her competitors.
