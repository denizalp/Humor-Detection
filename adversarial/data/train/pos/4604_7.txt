Small, efficient and independently owned.  It is recently opened for business. It is located next to NextCare Urgent Care & has a great working relationship by informing them what insurances they accept.  Which was originally helpful when I was there on July 4th & the pharmacist came into urgent care to inform them they were open for the holiday.  \n\nPhoenix Pharmacy serves a wide range of customers with acute (which would've been helpful for what I had-cervicalgia & muscle spasm:  i.e., severe inflamed neck pain) or chronic condition.  \n\nMy prescriptions were not able to be filled; due to the fact there was a temporary glitch with acceptance of my insurance.  Since it was a holiday; the pharmacist was unable to talk to my insurance company. The pharmacist came out personally to apologize & explain the situation.  He said he took my same insurance plan last week & doesn't understand why the glitch but did have the meds. Mind you they are newly opened & it was a holiday. No worries I went to my original pharmacy that had me in their system already. It just would've been very convenient.  Otherwise I would've gave them 5 stars for kind, professional service & convenience had it been filled. \n\nFor additional informational purposes from a brochure:  Phoenix Pharmacy will provide manufactured and compounded medications and are certified specialty pharmacist AAHIVM.
