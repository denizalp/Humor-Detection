I'm just gonna go ahead and give Drai's 5 stars. I may even go out on a limb here and say that Drai's is my new favorite nightclub in Vegas. Yea, it's that good. (Sorry XS!)\n\nWith a spacious indoor dance area and outdoor pool area (where Drai's Dayclub is), there is tons of space, especially when they open up the outside area and let you venture out, and it makes the inside area WAY cooler (temperature wise) which is awesome, because as we all know, dancing in a crowded stuffy area where you feel like you're going to collapse from heat stroke is NOT fun.\n\nThere's a giant disco ball-esque thing hanging from the ceiling that is mesmerizing. Seriously. It projects a crazy light pattern that is just amazing to look at.\n\nMultiple bar areas is also a plus, because then not everyone is crowded into one area trying to get at it.\n\nIt is on the smaller side in terms of Vegas clubs, but it is on the \"roof\" and when they open up the outside area all the way to the edge, you get an amazing view of the strip.\n\nGood things:\n- Chill crowd and atmosphere\n- Amazing dancers\n- Great views\n- Multiple bars\n- Indoor and outdoor area with a wading pool!\n\ntl;dr: I remember trying to go to Drai's a few years back when it was still just an after hours club. I was skeptical when I first heard we were heading to Drai's, but this most recent trip has transformed my opinion of Drai's. A \"must go to\" club in Vegas! Definitely a fave of mine now!
