Cars going in circles. Cars going in straight lines. Cars getting sideways. If you are looking for cars in motion, you'll find them going every which way here. The facility can host all the best motor sports: NASCAR, drag, road course, drifting... I think even monster trucks. And, they keep the schedule packed. \n\nSure, it may be in the middle of nowhere, but it is an easy to get to middle of nowhere-- a straight shot up 15N. You can't miss it, and there are distinct advantages to having a motor speedway in the middle of nowhere, such as practice runs until 1am!\n\nThe biggest downside to LVMS is that it is hot. Sure, given that I live in Las Vegas, I should probably realize that it is hot everywhere, but I think that this side of town must be closer to the sun because it feels a good 8 degrees hotter. I am sure all the asphalt doesn't help.\n\nOn my most recent visit, I was most impressed by the relative cleanliness of the bathrooms. Whenever I attend a sporting event or festival, I pretty much resign myself to having to brave nasty toilets. So, I was enthralled to find rows of freshly cleaned toilets with lids hoisted (hadn't been used yet!) when I first arrived. Of course, as the evening progressed, the bathrooms did get a little less sparkling, but I was still quite happy to have a respectable washroom available. It made watching cars considerably more pleasant.
