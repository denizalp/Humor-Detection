Nice place, clean, good service...but ramen was not very good. I had the tonkotsu ramen and the noodles seemed fresh but all stuck together. The broth didn't have any flavor. Char siu was mostly fat. We arrived at noon and the chicken karage was not available.  I was looking forward to this place being good because it's so close to my home and work, but unfortunately it wasn't.\nLooks like they have a lot of friends giving them great reviews...
