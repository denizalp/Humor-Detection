Oh. My. God. Each time we visit Vegas the Sterling Brunch is the first reservation we make. Late enough in the morning so that we can sleep off the fine dining and frolicking from the night before, and not so late that the nap we'll need afterward cramps our style. \n\nWhen you go, because you will, dress appropriately to impress at mid-day. The brunch takes place in Bally's Steakhouse and covets the upscale vibe. The lighting is low in a comforting way, they understand where you were last night, and why you are wearing your shades. And the booths are big and roomy. \n\nCome thirsty - the refills on all beverages are fast and generous. We always joke about bringing sharpies and just writing our names on the bottles of Perrier Jouet champagne that we'll empty - and then share an uncomfortable pause because we weren't really joking. \n\nCome hungry, because when that brief moment of silence is broken you'll be on your next trip to the buffet, and here is where I should admit that I do not generally like buffets, so let's call this a \"display\" of all things quest worthy for foodies: fresh, beautiful berries that taste like summer even in February. Surf that impresses this seafood lovin' north-westerner, turf that makes my mid-western roots tingle with glee, and eggs every way you like 'em! And there's more: pastries, chocolates, sauces, dips, rolls...\n\nYou, like me, may just feel the need to have some more champagne and think this through while delicately nibbling on some caviar and toast points.
