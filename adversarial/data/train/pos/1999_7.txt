Very clean store. I'm happy to hear that their meat is antibiotic and hormone free. Their animals have access to clean water, free to roam, and are not confined. Now here lies the problem. Their animals are fed corn, soy, and\/or wheat. Animals do not instinctively eat this type of feed unless they are hungry. \n\nI contacted Paramount head office and the general manager reached out to me and told me that the animal feed is government approved. He would not confirm whether the feed is non-genetically modified organism (non-GMO). \n\nThis leads me to believe that the most likely source of food for the animals is GMO since it is cheap to buy and readily available. And for those that do not know, GMO should be completely avoided. Unfortunately, this is a common practice in the meat industry and things are starting to change slowly. I hope Paramount pays heed to this. \n\nI expected more since you are paying more to get your meat from a premium halal butcher shop. That said, I will be getting my meat from BlossomPure Organic where their meat is either organic or pasture raised. Best of all it's halal.
