One of the many reasons I stop quite often at Greenland Supermarket is fresh seafood...from whole fish to sashimi grade fillet of tuna and salmon, Greenland has rare selections you won't find everywhere else. For whole fish, they will scale, butterfly, and wash your fish for you. They are not going to go out of their way to offer you a bag of courtesy ice like Whole Food would, but they will give it to you upon your request....so don't forget to ask. \n\nTheir sake collection is above average and fresh fruits and vegetables are vibrant--always carrying seasonal produce. Apple pears and soshito peppers are good now.  Even though they are known for Korean groceries, they also carry a variety of international products. \n\nTheir food court offers many choices from sushi, pho, Chinese-Korean fusion, to of course Korean food.....as good as you can expect for a quick and simple food court at fairly reasonable price. Also, don't forget to stop at Lepidor bakery on the way out.\n\nIt may not have fresh air like whole foods but fresh fish and produce await you.\n\nOpen everyday from 8am to 11pm.....really!!!
