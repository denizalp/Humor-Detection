Do you have any idea how good the pizza is here?\n\nOn a scale of 1-10, it is a 9.5.  I am only holding out because we have a Tony's Little Italy Pizza in Placentia, Ca. that ranks a 10 in my book.\n\nWe have been coming here for years, whenever we find ourselves in Las Vegas.  I think this may be the original location.  There is a decent amount of seating, not really huge, and bright, cheerful, NY ambiance.\n\nWe usually order the extra thick crust, but we were trying to cut down our carbs this time around, so went with a thin crust.  I loved it's thin \"crustiness\"  with cornmeal base, and would definitely do it again.\n\nBut....our real downfall was the fresh out of the oven, hot Italian bread with sesame seeds.  Fabulous tasting, it has a crumbly crust and the most tender insides you can imagine. They brought out a soup bowl of their amazing marinara sauce (I ended up drinking it like soup when everyone else was done) for dipping, and lots of butter.  I think I like the less acidic marinara even better than the pizza sauce.  Either way, you will be tripping over your feet trying to come back just for that.\n\nThe good Italian sausage with fennel seed, cheese, pepperoni, and fresh mushroom is our standard order.  It never disappoints.  A large size gives you 8 large slices.\n\nThey kept the Coke coming, and it was free with a Yelp check-in.  Even refilled our marinara bowl.  Such piggies we were.  No leftovers. \n\nWe walked away full and happy, 4 of us for ~ $30 including one generous glass of house red wine for Mr. B. \n\nHappy to share this with you!
