I met up with some friends here at Toddy Shop. It's located inside Inn Zone, but is moving to a new location very soon. Those who are from Vegas or have lived here long enough remember the days of Inn Zone (multiple locations then with family run business inside) having some of the best food in town, one in particular would regularly have a line out the door just for a bucket of their delicious chicken fingers. With that said, I'd never find it shocking or be surprised to still be able to get a really tasty meal at this now dive bar that could use a makeover. The dining area was clean and I personally wasn't bothered nor smelled any cigarette smoke, but I'm in a fucking bar in Vegas, so it wouldn't have bothered me anyway. Alcohol, food and cigarettes will happen in a bar... get over it. \n\nChef Hemant is the mastermind behind the menu at Toddy Shop. It's clear how genuinely passionate he is about the food being served and service to customers. Chef came out during our meal to make sure we liked it and answered and questions about some of the dishes on the menu. \n\nOur table shared many dishes family style and several things stood out for me. Certain things I was also eating for the first time and it was nice to venture out of my comfort zone to try something different. One thing hubby and I both thought had great flavor was the Rasta Wings that came with some delicious fried plantain on the side. Another dish that stood out was the Pot of Biriyani that had basmati rice, chicken masala, ghee, cashews, raisins and crispy onions which has excellent flavor. Everything we tried right down to the double-cut fried potatoes (ask for Indian ketchup to dip your fries in and thank me later) tasted really good and all of us agreed we'd come back. Wherever Chef Hamant relocates to... his customers are sure to follow.
