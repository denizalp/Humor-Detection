Are those chopsticks or are you just happy to sashimi? \n\nYup, I'm on that Poke train! I've been here a dozen times now, so I guess you can call me a fan of this place. If you're scared of raw fish, this might not be the place for you. It might be worth the try because you can't really taste the raw fish after smothering in that dressing and all the toppings. Oh, if you don't like choices, this place is not for you. \n\nHow it works: \n1. You open the door and walk in. Hold the door for others if they're within walking distance. Don't be rude. \n2. Choose a size (small, medium, or large).  This will depend on how many scoops of \"protein\" or the raw fish you get. Medium or large is generally pretty filling for me. And I eat a lot. \n3. Choose a base (white or brown rice, noodles, salad). My go to is the rice.\n4. Choose a protein (Tuna, Salmon, Tofu, Albacore, Spicy Tuna, Scallop\nShrimp, Octopus). You can mix and match. I generally get the tuna and salmon. The fish always look freshly cut. \n5. Choose a sauce (House Dressing, Ponzu, Spicy Mayo, Sweet Chili, Wasabi Mayo, Wasabi Shoyu, Shoyu, Gluten Free Soy Sauce). You can mix the sauces as well. I always get the house dressing and\/or spicy mayo. Then, they mix it and ask if you want sesame sauce to enhance the flavor. \n6. Choose any of the mix-in (Corn, Jalapeno, Edamame, Cilantro, Kale, Cucumber, Sweet onion, Green onion, Pineapple). You can add all of them, some of them, or none of them! I'm a pineapple type of guy, so I get that... corn, edamame, cilantro, and cucumbers. \n7. Choose 2 sides (Cucumber Salad, Seaweed Salad, Imitation Crab). \n8. Choose toppings (Avocado (cost extra), Ginger, Wasabi, Masago, Crispy Onion, Crispy Garlic, Mixed Nuts). I get the masago (small orange fish eggs or something. Idk, I just eat it) and crispy garlic. \n\nThey have a variety of different drinks that might be worth trying out too. The Macaroon ice creams are OK and nothing mind blowing. The workers there are really patient with the orders and can explain the above process really well. I don't have a lot of poke places to compare it to (yet) but I would recommend this place. \n\n#100threview
