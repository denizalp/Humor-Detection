My friend and I drove from Green Valley planning on getting to the theater with just enough time to park when the previews were about to start.  No luck.  The previews were supposed to start at 10:05 and we were there at 10:02.. all gates locked up and no one around to let us in.  I left my car outside and walked over to the concession area and it was closed.  A girl outside was pretty mad that they had sold her a large drink and popcorn and told her about the free refills and closed 10 minutes later.  Half of the movies had just started and the concessions were closed... doesn't make much sense to me!\n \nWe couldn't get in so we parked outside and watched about 1\/3rd of Despicable Me before being asked to leave.  It's a nice idea and affordable but make sure to be careful because it's in a really bad part of town.
