A companion and I ate here Oct. 16, a Saturday night. Dress code is business casual, so we each wore a shirt with button- down collar and slacks, and seemed to fit right in with most of the people dining there.\n The Palms seems to be targeting a younger, hip crowd, so the decor at the N9ne Steakhouse was not the traditional library with dark wood motif.\nInstead it was more like a club, with purple lighting, a bar in the center and somewhat loud music and conversations.\n The food, however, was great. I had the onion soup, 12 oz. filet mignon and Julie's hot potatoes, and my friend had the clam chowder, 22 oz. porterhouse and we shared an order of sauteed mushrooms. We both thought they were the best steaks we had ever eaten.\n Prices were not cheap. The steaks were about $55 each, sides are around $12.\n Service was top- notch. Since we were older and considerably less beautiful than their target demographic, my companion, in his mid- 50's, was a little uncomfortable there, having expected a traditional steakhouse experience. I was ok with it because the food and service were so good. I half expected to see Paris and her two little dogs eating porterhouse steaks at the next table; but alas, it was not meant to be!
