Las Vegas needs a real newspaper, and this isn't it. Owned by Sheldon Adelson, the Review-Journal is a rag, an absolutely deplorable, one-sided, sad excuse for a \"newspaper\" that is worth less than those gossip magazines at the grocery store. Ruining Las Vegas's reputation one day at a time, the writers here are solely interested in writing stories from the police scanner that is clearly centered in the middle of their office. They never report on anything worth while, nor national. Read the RJ only if you are looking to read a biased report of the following three things: Adelson, the Raiders, the latest police-involved shooting. This paper SUCKS!
