Boost-her juice! \n\nGreat place to take your gf since (not to generalize) most girls love smoothies since they are: a) healthy b)delicious and c) sweet.\n\nWhat I like about this Booster Juice particularly is that it isn't usually busy and the staff is quite friendly. The smoothies I've received from here have always been up to par and delicious. In fact reviewing this place really makes me want to go back. The location is close to my house so  it's a bit too easy to stop here after work every day but I try not to because Booster Juice in general is a little pricey ($5-$10 per smoothie). However, they are healthy and awesome so I definitely recommend getting one to reward yourself after the gym or to make your gf happy (tip of the day). \n\nThe best part about this store is that they have this piece of gym equipment that they are promoting or something and you get to play around on it while waiting for your smoothies to get ready. I hate wasting time, so it's a way to feel productive while waiting.
