David is a true artist for his work. He was willing to work upon my request and treated us with such a nice and professional manner. It was so easy to talk to David regarding the cake option for my wedding. I lost the cake stand, he still gave me partial refund. I required venue changed, he was quick to switch options. Every time I contact him, he has never obliged to refuse any of my \"crazy\" needs. \n\nThe decoration is nice and beautiful. I have to say that the cake tastes so good. I like the lemon filling while my husband loves the coffee flavor. I just wish that this bakery was somewhere near me, so I can come back and support his business more in the future.
