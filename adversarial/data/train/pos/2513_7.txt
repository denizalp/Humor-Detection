Such a cute little spot! \nI live on the southwest side and am enjoying the fact this area is growing and is now home to a few new bars and restaurants. \n\nThis gem is absolutely wonderful I LOVED their quinoa salad, it had a unique flavor and came with an incredible Avo dressing. The portion was rather huge and it was only $6.95! Very impressed by that. \n\nThe drinks looked great as well and the decor is nice. One con is that there are not too many places to sit down. Literally 4 tables I believe and a few more spots outside, which is, as we know, only optional half of the year, or less. \n\nBottom line is I loved this place and will most definitely be back again!
