What's better than listening to your favorite Biggie jams while chowing down on a fairfax? Not a whole lot. This breakfast sammy is one of life's perfect hangover food. \n\nThose eggs made oh so creamy with a melt slice of cheddar and caramelized onions. And what sandwich would be complete with our the srircha mayo? This one. \n\nThe line seems long but moves fairly quick. It's not the healthiest breakfast sandwich on the market but damn, it sure is tasty.
