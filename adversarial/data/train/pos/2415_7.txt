I was extremely disappointed with Buffet @ Asia for multiple reasons. My boyfriend and I were in the mood for chinese and decided we would try this place. When we got to the buffet, we were sat all the way in the back of the restaurant, in a dirty two seater booth, which was right next to the garbage, the dishwashing station, and the soda dispenser. We asked nicely to be moved to another table so they took us into the other room and made us stand in the middle of everyone holding our plates and drinks. After much confusion, we decided to move to a table next to our original one that was a little bit cleaner. That was just the beginning of a bad experience. The food was okay, typical chinese buffet food - nothing special. We both love sushi, so we were happy to see that they had a good selection. However, all of the sushi was sitting under hot lights!! It definitely was not safe to eat! Then, while we were eating, a family was sat behind us. About five minutes later, the waiters came running over to their table telling them that they needed to pay more (for an infant)! They were going back and forth until the family decided they would just pay for the baby so they could just be left alone. It was extremely distracting, uncomfortable, and awkward. The waiters were incredibly rude, laughing at the family and mocking them. Overall, it was an awful experience. I would not recommend this place to anyone!
