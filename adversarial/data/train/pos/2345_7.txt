Accio Coffee! This place is one the places in the world that has a Harry Potter theme. This is my second time here and I remember enjoying what i ordered last time. This time my sis and I got the Mint Mojito and the Nitrogen Brew. The Mint Mojito is an attempt to make something similar to Philz Mint Mojito that I am accustomed to. It didn't really hit the mark because it was not cold enough, not minty enough, and not coffee-y enough. It was decent but probably not something I'd order again. The Nitrogen Brew is a cold brew that is supposed to have a smoother taste but to me, it had a harsher taste that I have had with other cold brews. It doesn't come with ice but it was cool when I received it. I'd suggest adding in a couple of ice cubes.\n\nSo the drinks this time weren't great but the theme makes up for it. The decor is super cool with brooms and other HP-themed memorabilia. There are several small tables and a larger bar table so definitely a good place to get work done if you don't mind the somewhat dark mood lighting.\n\nOverall, I'd still recommend it but ask them to make what they are known for.\n\nBTW, they also have craft beers available.
