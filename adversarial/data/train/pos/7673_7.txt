First thing I noticed about this restaurant was the mix of well balanced Asian and American patrons dining here. I also noticed they were lacking a large fish tank where they would have kept fresh crabs\/fish\/lobsters. They removed crab entrees from their menu although it clearly showed on the older photos of menu from Yelpers. But that's okay. There were plenty of other dishes we wanted to try.\nWe noticed they had wide selection of chow fun so had to order beef chow fun with black bean sauce. It was good but I was not all that impressed. Also tried the Choy Sum vegetable dish. It was fresh and had a nice crunch but wish the flavor had infused more into the vegetable. \nLastly, our beef\/tendon turnip hotpot was decent, had good flavor. However, the turnip was too firm, tasted like it was cooked separately and added in later like an afterthought.\nOverall, I think they deserve a 3.5 stars but not enough for a 4. Sorry I really wanted to like this restaurant.
