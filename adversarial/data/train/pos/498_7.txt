Love, love, love this stadium! But we had a box so...what's not to love? The experience was fantastic and made me wonder why I had not ventured out to Spring Training prior to this year.  (I've been in AZ for two years now.)  If you aren't a Cubs fan, I would definitely wait until they're playing your team and check out this stadium.  Oh, and if you can get together a large group, definitely splurge for the box.
