$1 and some change tacos done right. They aren't colossal, but they are delicious and hot, teeming with the straight-from-the-grill flavor that makes a taco memorable. I sampled the carnitas and asada, and in addition to being flavorful, they tasted fresh and didn't leave me with taco belly afterwards. \n\nThe salsa bar is modest, but the tomatillo was top notch. I was sure to put a generous portion on both of my tacos.\n\nIn addition to good food, the atmosphere manages to feel both \"authentic\" and gringo-friendly. The TVs featured Spanish programs, and the walls are covered with futbol and other memorabilia. However, the workers speak perfect English, and the menus are kind enough to have English translations. I would definitely take my not-so-adventurous mom here.\n\nAlso worth noting, the menu featured more than just tacos. I was tempted to try a tamale, but I wanted to test out the tacos first. There's always next time!
