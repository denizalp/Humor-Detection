Von's is part of Safeway. Years ago, Safeway went out to remodel their stores, tearing out flourescent strip lighting, switching to mood-spot lighting like a department store, redesigning the bakery, deli, and produce areas, adding Starbucks concessions and Wells Fargo bank branches inside, and raised prices and tried to raise quality, and introduced their own \"O\" brand (no, not Oprah's, but Organic!) to compete with Whole Paycheck, er I mean Whole Foods, and get higher margins sales, or loyal customers with the Safeway Club card for big discounts off the inflated prices. \n\nMost every California Safeway has gone through this transformation. But Von's and Nevada are a little behind. \n\nThere are two \"Ghetto Von's\" in the east side of Las Vegas, pretty close to each other, just off the Maryland Blvd. This one on Twain has been remodeled finally.\n\nBut unfortunately, they couldn't remodel the riff raff clients. And the remodel isn't the same, because this place doesn;t have the volume of well heeled customers like the suburban Summerlin and Henderson locations, so the shelves are half empty. \n\nBut you can find about 6 scooter chairs here to shop around in. And a bank of slot machines to idle away your time and loose change or pocket money. And the slot machine change guy is easier to find than another checker to open up a new line after 10 people are waiting in only one.\n\nThe other \"Ghetto Von's\" hasn't finished remodeling yet. It is a mess. So it is a step down for a store, but the people who frequent it are a slight step up.
