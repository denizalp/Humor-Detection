WORST BRUNCH IN MADISON!!!!! See my picture!\n\nSeriously disappointing brunch, I got the breakfast sandwich and it was a complete disgrace to food and restaurants around the downtown area. \n\nThe sandwich itself was comical, my friends and I could not stop laughing at how seriously sad it looked. Rather than cheddar cheese as the menu lists, it contained a few unmelted slices of kraft American singles....I seriously urge you to check the picture I uploaded to see this monstrosity.  The bacon was anemic looking and slightly undercooked and the bread was a joke, it looked and felt like it was microwaved - untoasted completely but slightly warm. The menu also listed a Dijon mayo for the sandwich which was no where to be found. The egg was ok I guess? It honestly felt like a cook ran out of cheese and decided hitting up Walgreens for a pack of kraft singles was a good idea. \n\nOne of my group members got the French Toast and it was just two small slices of a baguette. Not thick cuts or anything, we thought it may have been a joke when we saw the two small pieces of bread, but alas it was reality. Not only was there an abysmally minuscule amount of French toast, it was bland and lacking flavor.\n\nMy friend asked if we could speak to a manager but apparently they were busy on a call. They ended up comping her orange juice...again it made no sense but at least it was comical.\n\nI eat out around Madison 4-5 times a week and this is the first time I have just been completely shocked by food lacking in quality. I seriously urge you to save your money or try any other place, heck even the subway next door is better.
