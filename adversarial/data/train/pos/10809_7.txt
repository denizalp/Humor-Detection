Timo is the shit! My SO and I have followed him from his prior shop in Mesa (ugh) to his new shop, 5th Estate, in downtown Gilbert (double ugh). He is worth the drive to BFE, friends! If I recall, Timo apprenticed with Aaron Coleman... which undoubtedly nurtured his sinister streak, which manifests as decapitated severed demon heads (as evidenced by my SO's calf) and such. Don't sweat it, kittens, he also does pretty things too -- all solidly and professionally done. I believe his favorite style is traditional Japanese, but he rocks old-school Americana pretty damn well too. His prices are reasonable, he's gotten really fast, and, maybe most importantly, he's not a dick, a rarity in the tattoo world! Woo hoo!
