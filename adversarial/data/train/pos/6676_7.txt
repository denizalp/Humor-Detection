Unless you are a regular or look like your wallet is fat don't expect the best service.  Entrees cost about 20-38 bucks and Anti pasta runs between 5-20 desserts are all 8 bucks unless you get aged balsamic vinegar.  They also have a big cheese selection. \n\nI made reservations for this restaurant and they sat us by the back door.  The waiter never once explained anything on the menu or suggested a wine to go with our meal.  He didn't even tell us about the cheese menu except to check on the one we wanted.  The other waiter for a table near ours went out of his way to explain the menu and go as far as to tell his tables how to eat the cheese ( it comes with jelly's and such) .  \n\nMy meal was good I had the duck.  She had the salmon which tasted very fishy.  Not fresh at all.  The wine was 40 bucks for a carafe ( maybe if we would have got a 100 dollar bottle we would have gotten better service)  The Dessert was good it was a rich chocolate cake with nuts and chocolate sauce. Nothing too special.  \n\nOverall the experience made the meal not worth the 115 bucks in these times not to mention they overcharged my girls card for the drinks at the bar.  If we dont want to give 25% don't charge it plain and simple.  \n\nJust a warning reservations and customer service mean nothing.  We mentioned our complaints to the waiter and manager.  We received an apology but how bout comp our dessert or something.  Hyatt Gainey staff is also rude for the most part.  \n\nTwo thumbs way down.
