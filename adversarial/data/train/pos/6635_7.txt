How awesome is this place?!?! I lived just down the street for four years and just so happened to stumble in around valentine's day to see what it was about. Of course, considering the upcoming holiday, it was pretty busy, but not bad. All the girls working there were so nice. When I told one of them that was behind the counter that it was my first time stopping in, she got super excited and asked me what I would like to sample. They have SO MANY different things that it was a little overwhelming to choose, so she gave me what was her favorite--some kind of chocolate covered peanut butter thing. So of course it was fabulous. \n\nYou can get different sized boxes and mix and match different chocolate covered wonderfulness, and they also have boxes already made up that give you a little bit of everything. They make up so many different kinds of..I don't even know what to call them. They have high heel shoes made out of chocolate. Chocolate that looks like lipstick. Stuff with Cleveland on it. If you're looking for something sweet to give someone, this is definitely the place to go to wow them. Unbelievable.
