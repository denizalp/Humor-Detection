It has been years since I've had peameal bacon and after being alerted by Michael U to its existence at Salted Malted, I had to make the trip to North Las Vegas to get some.  I used to stop on Hurontario Street in Mississauga on my way home from Toronto to have breakfast and get my peameal bacon fix.  Now it's fairly close by.\n\nI came here after an appointment.  The place was empty and I went to the counter to order.  I got the Canadian Sunrise which is peameal bacon, cheddar cheese, egg over easy, and on aa biscuit.  I got coffee with the sandwich.\n\nI sat at a table and did some photos while waiting for the sandwich.  It arrived in an appropriate amount of time and it was excellent.  The biscuit was great--very flaky and buttery and the bacon was really worth the trip.  I didn't see any plastic utensils as I hadn't moved from my table when I arrive but the biscuit was so flaky I could have used a fork to gather up the bits that broke away it was that fresh.\n\nI saw some pastries and cookies that I need to stop by again to try.  This trip, I was on a mission for the Canadian Sunrise and it was great!
