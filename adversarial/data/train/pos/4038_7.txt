It's another great place for Happy Hour, especially in one of its upstairs terraces with a view! HH: 3:30-6:30pm & 9:30-closing, daily.\n\nIt has an excellent HH menu of $3-7 food and half-price drinks. In addition, it also offers special $10 food\/drink combos on some wk-days. Its service is excellent. \n\nIt has a mid-upscale decor and a comfortable ambience; tables have tablecloth. Inside are a very nice bar counter and a large, comfortable lounge\/dining area. Go enjoy! - I did!!! - [BTW: Smokers have their own separate terrace patio.]\n\nBased on fellow Yelpers' good reviews, I gave this English Gastro Pub a try a few days ago, after visiting the Apple Store. And it did not disappoint!\n- I now have another nice place in to hang out in Town Square!\n\nMY HH EXPERIENCE:\n\nWhen I walked in, the mgr (Matt) and waitress (Jane) introduced themselves warmly, and led me to the gorgeous terrace area. It had an eye pleasing view of the park below. As Jane promptly brought me my beer, I settled down in no time, taking in the view and playing with my new toy from the Apple Store. For bar food, I had  Zuccini ($3) and Sausage wraps ($5). For drinks, I had Newcastle Ale ($3.5), and a cab ($3.5). \n- The zuccinis were so crunchy and tasty that I ordered a second one, with an extra Newcastle for good measure! The sausage wrap was only so-so, however. \n- The cab (Canyon Road) was silky smooth and full-bodied. I had to resist the urge to have another glass, which was NOT easy!\n- My tab came to $24 (plus tips) - which seemed high for one person, but then I had one EXTRA drink and one EXTRA bar dish than I normally would, which had made me 2x as happy anyway - still a good bargain!\n\nSUGGESTIONs TO MANAGEMENT:\n1. Please include a \"List of Daily Specials\" on the table, or include an insert in the menu.\n\n2. Prior to the start of HH, please MAKE SURE, that ALL THE PATIO TABLES are CLEAN! -  When I first got in the patio, I found several tables covered with some white dusts - an eye sore, but easy to fix! Waitress Jane apolozied and promptly changed the table cloth for my selected table; and went on to do the same for others.\n\nPeterskis, Oct 2012
