I have been a very loyal customer to Japango for the past 5 years, but this has changed due to a recent incident that happened. I will never look at the restaurant the same and obviously will NEVER go back again.\n\nI ordered Chicken Katsu last Thursday through UberEats, I've ordered the same dish from UberEats many times before. Around 2:30 AM on Friday, I woke up and started throwing up. Since then I threw up every 30 minutes to an hour until approx. 10:30 in the morning (total of around 10 times). I \"crawled\" to a walk-in clinic around noon and the doctor said I got food poisoning. I then stayed on my bed for the rest of Friday with a fever of 39 degrees. I spent the entire weekend on my bed and did not eat anything until Saturday night.\n\nMy mom and my boyfriend went to Japango Friday evening to complain about this incident, only to get shoved away by the store manager (a male Korean). His attitude was unbelievably bad and he said he was \"very busy\" and did not have time to deal with us. He asked us to reach out to UberEats since we ordered from them, and said the restaurant had no responsiblity (Excuse me??? UberEats only delivers my food, I don't think they cook the food???) The manager also said that they pay UberEats $10,000 every month for UberEats to deal with things like this. One time a girl also got food poisoning and she got a solution by reaching out to UberEats.\n\nI am extremely disappointed at how the store manager handled this situation. He did not apologize or show sympathy at all for the poor food quality. When I told my friends about this incident, many of them said that they've noticed the food quality has gotten worse at Japango recently (one of my friends got food poisoning from the uni sashimi one time). So, definitely will never return again.\n\nBYE.
