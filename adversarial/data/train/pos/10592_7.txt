I use fossil fuels. It's a fact. And this is where I often get them. I'm sure you're thinking that I'm gassing up here and it's true, I do hit the petrol as hard as anybody. I haven't managed to kick that habit yet. But it's the propane I get here too. They are quick and convenient to top off the BBQ tank. \n\nWhenever I pop my head in and say I need propane, dude behind the counter hollers for a woman. She comes out to the tank and fills it up. Quickly and professionally, observing all applicable safety standards and OSHA regulations. Much more competent than Gomer at the Home Depot.
