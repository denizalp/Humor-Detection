I have been going to this local eatery for years and had many good, basic pub-style meals here. I have to give it only two stars because on my recent visit, the wings (that used be excellent) were the smallest, scrawniest things I have ever seen. They should call them chick wings as they look as if they were taken from baby birds. The new renovations look great but please reconsider ordering wings if you decide to give this neighbourhood spot a try.
