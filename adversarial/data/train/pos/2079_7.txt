Had a lovely night out with a group of Yelpers here. Having been warned that Montreal is not a sushi town, and that all-you-can-eat sushi buffets here can be kind of dicey, I was going in with low expectations. However, I really enjoyed the meal (and not just the excellent company!).\n\nRice and fish were decent, on par with some of the more expensive places around town and much better than, say, Sushi Shop. Salmon and white tuna sashimi were available at weekday supper (not at lunch except on weekends) and red tuna was available in a roll only.\n\nLots of cooked food options (including dim sum) for those, like my husband, who would rather avoid seaweed and raw fish.\n\nService was fast despite being in a large group, and food came out just as soon as we had finished the last plateful. The hot dishes were served piping hot. We were offered a bucket of ice for our wine as well as little cups for our sake. There were a few little glitches with our orders but we certainly all had more than enough to eat.\n\nSpecial thanks to Mark G. for the introduction to beef sashimi. As a fan of rare roast beef, I can't believe I had never tried this before.\n\nMy favourite part was when the waiter encouraged us to order a second round of dessert! So sad that I was too full for mango ice cream.
