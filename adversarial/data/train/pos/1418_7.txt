I wish the east coast was half as cool as Vegas, because this place fucking ruled! First of all the lady bartender was as cool as shit! She wanted to know everyone at the bar. You could've been a king or a popper and she was down! Give this chick a raise! Second of all, coconut and clue was down as well! They came over and talked to us and had the whole bar friggn grooving. After we left we were still bar hopping because of the major high, you guys all rocked! What an awesome Vegas experience!
