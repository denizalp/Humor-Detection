Came here to celebrate a friend's birthday (group of six). We ordered a drink for each of us, a platter (to share), a pizza (to share), and a main for each of us. We each paid roughly $45 each totalling about $270 worth of food and drink. This is a relatively expensive place. Mains average around $21 per plate, appetizers around $11 a plate. \n\nOur server was great. She was very friendly and attentive; came back to check on us multiple times throughout the night to make sure we were doing OK.\n\nWe were thoroughly unimpressed by the appetizers. The fried items on the platter were _very_ oily and the pizza was bland. Our mains were extremely salty, to the point where it was inedible. All six of us were unable to take more than two bites before we had to stop.\n\nThe manager (Ming) came over to ask us how we were doing and we informed him about the food. He tells us that their head chef had quit a few days prior, and there has been a sabotage in the kitchen and tells us \"it is what it is\".\n\nWhen it came time for the bill, we asked the manager for a discount because none of us could eat our food. He asks us to \"flip a coin for it\". Confused, we all start looking for a coin when he says \"I'm just fucking with you\". He explains about the sabotage again and says \"it is what it is\" before disappearing to the back. We assume that he went to go print us new bills with a discount, but 15 minutes pass and we don't see him. Our server comes to check in on us, and she has no idea what is happening, and we have to explain to her the situation. Only then do we get our new bills with 10% off -- enough for half of a beer.\n\nOur server also informs us that no one in the kitchen had quit, and that the entire staff is putting up with this manager's attitude towards them.\n\nTL;DR: According to the manager there is a sabotage in the kitchen, so everything tastes like a bucket of salt. It is what it is.
