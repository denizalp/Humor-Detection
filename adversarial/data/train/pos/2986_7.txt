This has to be my favorite sushi spot and I can't believe it is in Vegas. Thank you to the chef for having spot on fresh sushi. I tried a variety of things and I couldn't be more impressed. \n\n- mussel- so plump and juicy, the perfect mussel\n- echiwa ebi (hairy crab)- the meaty crab and subtle buttery taste was pure heaven\n- clam- loved the hint of seasme oil drizzled on it. It was super fresh. the sweet plum was a nice addition\n-conch- the texture was chewier and harder, I wasn't a huge fan favorite, but you may like it\n-large scallops- really fresh and mild tasting\n-silver salmon- soft and has a more subtle fish taste\n-regular salmon- buttery and melts in your mouth\n- live shrimp- tastes like it just jumped out of the ocean, crunch and light tasting\n\nthe sorbets were the perfect finish at the end of a delicious sushi dinner. Thank you Yummy Grill & Sushi for an amazing sushi experience.
