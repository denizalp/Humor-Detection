I came here for a UYE months ago and yes I'm double dipping for reviews but this is a review for just Novecento since everything that was served was on the normal menu. Their pizzas are amazing and so are their salads. Put them all together talk about one of the better things I've eaten.  5 star easily for their pizzas and salads maybe even a 6th star if they had them. Order anything and everything you wont leave unsatisfied. They also have a good selection of gelato and other items, they were ok. The kitchen is open and so is the view of their wood burning pizza oven.  \n\nThe one or two things I didn't care for was 1 the interior decor and feel of the restaurant. Pre-Yelp days I probably have walked in then out but that's me being picky. And 2 the way it seemed like the chef was talking down other pizza restaurants just because \"they didn't go to Italy for training to cook pizza\" personally I don't care about that, all I care for is excellent tasting pizza which they already have.\n\nAlso for you Yelpers that are closer to Henderson there is a Novecento Pizzeria opening up. The sign is already up.  Located on South Eastern next to Republic Kitchen & Bar or in the same plaza as BJ's. LOL I'm slacking once again, they're already open. Both of their locations are no where near me so it won't be on my usual pizza spot rotations wish they were though.
