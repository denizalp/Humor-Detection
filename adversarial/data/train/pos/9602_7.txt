I love seeing this show. If you consider yourself a patriotic person and love America then this is a must see if just once when in Vegas. Also, it's free!\n\nSam's Town is one of those locals casinos that is off the strip on the Boulder Highway. This stretch of road features a bunch of more western themed lower-level casino hotels that draw in a local crowd and older clientele. Sam's Town is one of the better ones, and the casino itself can be a great little place to gamble with it's lower amount buy ins at the blackjack and table games. It's a nice casino, but nothing flashy or trendy, and will sometimes have some scary Jerry Springer types walking around.\n\nBut the crown jewel of this place is the center Mystic Fall Park atrium that features a really cool laser and light show set to country western and patriotic music. Animatronic robotic animals are all part of the experience too. The Atrium itself is set up as a park \/ forest with some restaurants and shopping along the outside, the main check in desk, and centered with a nifty bar area right in the middle. It's a perfect spot to see the show with a drink in your hand. Plus, as the show is performed at night everything is lit up all around it, and there is even a waterfall in here. If you stay overnight try to get a room overlooking the atrium and show.\n\nThe animals move around, the wolves howl, and there is even a water show as fountains shoot eight stories into the air, and dancing waters move to music from patriotically bombastic to country USA. Go America! U-S-A! U-S-A! It's a terrific little show to see, but not anything like the Fountains of Bellagio, but it is free. Plus, it's indoors, so weather is never a factor. If you have a car and some time to kill take a trek over to see it. \n\nFree Shows Daily  - Laser Light & Water Show - 6pm, 8pm & 10pm
