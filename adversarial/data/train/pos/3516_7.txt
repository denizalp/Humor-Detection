If it wasn't for this hospital, I can bet you that I wouldn't be alive right now. Long story short, I had an emergency and according to doctors I had a 50\/50 chance of survival. As soon as I got  there, the ER staff could tell I was in distress and I was checked in within seconds and in the back receiving treatment in minutes. I was hospitalized for over one month, with 3 of those weeks in ICU, and everyone except maybe two RNs were all awesome. \n\nThe hospital is very new, clean, modern, and quiet. For visitors, the lobby is very large and I was impressed by it (when I left, as I never saw the outside of my room for a month). The cafeteria is non profit (what my dad told me) and the meals available are decent and very reasonably priced. He liked the shrimp salad best and it was about $5. Visiting hours are 24 hrs.\n\nFor patients, the rooms are private; no sharing rooms. Lots of hospitals you share a room with a stranger and just have a curtain to separate you, not here. The RNs are very good and mostly on time with giving meds, esp the night crew. Everything is in-house; CT scans, surgery, labwork, etc all done at the facility and you get results same day. You don't see the doctors for very long (like a minute if you're lucky), but there were a lot of different specialists that checked in with me. As for food, when I finally was able to eat, I was on a full liquid diet, and they really give you everything they have available: broth soup, ice cream, jello, coffee, iced tea, Italian ice, pudding.\n\nNo five stars bc I still have to deal with a billing issue, but overall this was as pleasant of an experience that it could have been esp with having to deal with extreme pain. I hope I never have to go to an Er again, but if I do, def I would come back to this hospital.
