I will say that the drinks are reasonably priced. I never ate here, but judging from the menu it seems like the food is reasonably priced as well. But I just wouldn't hang out here at all. Kind of seems a bit divey and not in a fun way like Ducky's or something like that. \n\nOne of my weaknesses is that sometimes I have trouble pinpointing the factual reasons for feeling icky about a place, person or thing. However, perhaps this next anecdote would be an example why I felt uncomfortable here. \n\nOne of the patrons chose to wear gym shorts from the 1970s that accentuated the flatness of his buttocks and the whiteness of his skin (real snug and not in a Calvin Klein kind of way). And to make things more interesting he decided to further enhance his look with the shoes and socks with shorts look. Nice! \n\nNow I am far from a fashionista and a man's buttocks aren't objects I naturally gravitate towards (not that there is anything wrong with that), but it was little things like this that turned me off from Watchman's. Plus the beer selection is a bit limited and it took forever to find my waitress to pay my bill. It always humors me when it's such a chore to give a pub my money.\n\nI must be in the minority because it seems like a popular place, but I am not sure I would want to come here again. Maybe it was just this visit.
