Filet mignon and scallops were on point. Thick cut, dry aged beef. Not the best steak of my life, but very good and well cooked. One of my three scallops was still quite sandy, which was disappointing in a restaurant where you would expect a better food preparation. 4 stars on steak, 2 stars on scallops. The garlic mashed potatoes had too much butter and cream in them for my liking, making the consistency and texture a little too smooth and pasty. Good flavor still, but probably only ate 3-4 bites out of a VERY good sized portion. \n\nThe Manhattan clam chowder was perhaps the best I've ever had. Tons of clam meat, perfectly cooked potato, and a nice thick (but not too heavy or rich) broth. 5 stars on the soup!\n\nThe bread was amazing. Great texture and the dipping sauce was fantastic. Hate filling up on bread, but I did have two pieces. :-) 5 stars\n\nHad a piece of key lime pie for dessert. Had a much more subtle, subdued flavor than I usually find with key lime, which I appreciated, as it can often be too tart to really want to eat the whole slice. Very smooth custard ended up having a texture more like a good cheesecake, but still with good citrusy flavor from the lime. Would have liked a tad thicker base crust, but I'll give it 4.5 stars!\n\nAll in all, it is one of the more expensive places I've been from an entree standpoint. $75 for an 8 oz and 3 scallops? It better be dynamite. It was very good, but maybe not enough for me to come back, considering the higher price compared to Mastro's, Capital Grille, et al. But my mouth is happy, so I'll give it 3 stars.
