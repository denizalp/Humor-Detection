Interesting little place. It's somewhat un expecting from the road.  It's nothing special inside but clean. The staff was very friendly and helpful. Attached is a tiny market that carries some frozen take home items, candies, baked goods and a mish mash of things. I had to buy a couple boxes of chocolate covered jellies. Cherry and blueberry. Yum! \nThe restaurant has a lot of sausages, cabbage rolls, cabbage dishes, pierogi dishes, stews, and even some interesting wines. \nI had the borsch, my first, and it was great. I really enjoyed it. I also had a cabbage salad. It had a slight sweet taste, but I really liked it. I'm not sure how quickly I'll come back, but I will try it again for sure.
