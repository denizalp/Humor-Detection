I'm not sure what went wrong on my trip to Sinful Sweets.  I was really excited to try here after reading the reviews, but it did not quite meet my expectations.\n\nI got a red velvet milkshake ($4.99).  Other reviewers talk about this amazing service, and I was pulling teeth to get a basic milkshake on a Thursday night at rush hour.  I asked for recommendations and could not even get that from the person working the counter.  Maybe it was just an off day.  The actual milkshake was great with amazing flavor, but I really wanted a chocolate dipped straw like other reviewers had.  That definitely did not happen.  Maybe I'll make it back here eventually for a second try, but I was bummed out.\n\nThey do take credit cards!
