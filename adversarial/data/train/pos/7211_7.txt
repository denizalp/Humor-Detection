more like a 3.62135\/5 stars.\n\nthis restaurant very similar to cheesecake factory, in fact i believe its owned by cheesecake factory.  so if you like CF, then this place will feel like home to you. \nits located right next to the elevators for the rooms on the casino floor at the venetian.\n\nWe wanted to start off with an appetizer and went ahead and ordered the \nDouble Stuffed Potato Spring Roll.  it came out hot, and was pretty guud.  however for the 8 bucks, i do not think it was totally worth it.  you get about 8 small pieces of just hot potatoes stuffed inside egg rolls.  meh.   \n\nWe also ordered the Salmon with brown rice and the Pulled pork with side salad.  Both dishes were good. \nThe salmon dish was creamy and there were sizable chunks of salmon in there.\nas for the pulled pork, from what i remember it was delicious.  i think the bread was a bit hard, but whateverz. \n\nthe server was nice and super attentive.\n\nyou'll see a lot of drunk peeps here past midnight.  lol.  make sure to give everyone high fives, since strangers love that.
