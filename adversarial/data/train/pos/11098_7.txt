So how exactly do I describe the Fremont Street Experience?\n\nWell, I saw a huge pedestrian mall with fantabulous light shows and loud rock music (they loved playing Heart songs last night).\n\nI saw street performers and lots of crowd pleasing weirdness everywhere.\n\nI saw a guy in a jockstrap singing as people tossed coins in his bucket.\n\nI saw Shrek and his Princess posing for pictures.\n\nI saw two guys dressed up as creepy looking babies.\n\nI saw and heard live music on multiple stages.\n\nI saw people flying through the sky on zip lines in prone positions, looking like a fleet of Supermen and Superwomen.\n\nI saw spectacular flashy walls of neon everywhere.\n\nI smelled a lot of cannabis in the air.\n\nI saw thousands of people partying and having a great time.\n\nI bet you will too.
