I missed out on the chance to check this out last year.  So when I saw the signs and billboards start popping up around town this year, I vowed not to miss it again. \n\nI struggled between 3 or 4 stars on this one, so I will just stick with 3.5!\n\nIt was very cool to get to walk around and take in the whole Christmas-y atmosphere they have created in the middle of the strip. They have a huge light \"tree\" that towers just off the strip and changes colors constantly. They have the dinky little skating rink there as well. I'm not a skater myself, but the people on there at the time seemed to be enjoying themselves.\n\nThey had all the \"tree people\" and other costumed characters out there taking pics with everybody which was very cool as well. They actually wouldn't accept tips, which made it fun to just bop around and snap pics with all the odd, mytical-looking oddities there.\n\nThey also had some kind of little show there at the top of the hour but I just happenned to walk in right at the end. Bummer!\n\nAll in all, for the price (free! ), what do you want? After grabbing a bite to eat and walking around some, this was just a cool way to kill a bit of time. \n\nIt's nothing to run way out of your way for, but if you happen to catch it...take it all in and enjoy! I know we did!\n\n3.5 stars.
