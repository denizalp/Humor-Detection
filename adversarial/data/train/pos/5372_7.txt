I brought back some California goodies for my friend and in return he took me out to Grampa's Pizzeria. Definitely a fair trade. \n\nWhen I first walked into Grampa's I was surprised at how cozy and romantic the place is. It feels like you're eating dinner in a house that was converted into a restaurant. \n\nEnough about the ambiance, let's talk pizza. OH. MY. GOD. So thin, so good, so perfect. I can't remember the name of the pizza we got, but it had sausages which packed some heat. Gramps really knows how to do thin crust well. The crust is thin and crispy even with all the toppings on it. \n\nPizza is life. Grampa's you make my life complete.
