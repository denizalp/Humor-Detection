Cateriing Review: \nWorking in a predominantly Hispanic office Tacos always go over well, but with most mom n' pop spots unable (or unwilling) to cater and Mi Gusta merely average it was to Pink Taco at The Hard Rock Hotel and Casino that #supportlocal lunch turned on Thursday, Chef Bradley Manchester and his team arriving thirty minutes early to assemble a feast for twenty-five that exuded both quality and professionalism.  \n\nPerhaps not a traditional pick for off-site catering, the Los Angeles import now far outpacing its original location both in terms of earnings and volume, it was with the same $20 per guest budget previously afforded to Border Grill that two Chefs made several trips up elevators and down stairs before beginning to assemble some nine items, everything brought in Chafing dishes collected by another Pink Taco employee later.\n\nGuaranteeing an unprecedented level of freshness by dressing Salads, garnishing Tacos and saucing Enchiladas on-site, a jumbo-stack of Tamales finding favor amongst all whether doused in Poblano Cream or not, it was quite surprising that even those prone to more modest flavors enjoyed both crispy Flautas stuffed with Chicken and the Resturant's signature dish, the bright color amusing a speaker out of Oregon who was thrilled to have a good audience throughout his entire presentation.\n\nPleasing lighter lunchers with wedges of Romaine topped in Bacon balanced by pickled Onions and Cheese, though several opted to add Carne Asada and roasted Poblanos intended for Street Tacos to this or housemade Corn Chips, it was unfortunately Chicken Sandwiches with too much Bread that were forgotten in favor of better choices, the Enchiladas going over well with those who enjoy a bit of heat though their best selling point was actually a thick Mole that doubled down on smoked Mushrooms to yield ample earthiness.\n\nFinishing up with Dessert, Hard Rock Pastry Chef Mickey Harden veering off-menu for two special treats, suffice it to say that the only \"flaw\" in thick Rice Pudding with Vanilla and Cinnamon was that a bigger bowl would have made over-consumption less obvious while the thick Flan de Queso topped like a Pina Colada was worth every calorie and potential embarrassment suffered from eating several slices.\n\nOverall the team from Pink Taco set a new standard of excellence on Thursday, every moment from arrival and on-site assembly to collecting their own serving dishes the following day an absolute class-act from start to finish and undoubtedly the most universally praised #supportlocal lunch to date.
