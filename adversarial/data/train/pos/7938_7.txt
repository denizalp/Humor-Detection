We went there Saturday afternoon for lunch and ordered to go. It took two people to tell us somebody will be with you shortly and 20 minutes later somebody finally took our order, and the place wasn't even busy!\n\nWe had to ask twice for our water while we waited, something that you'd expect to get while you waited. As we were sitting there, we noticed so many health code violations, including seeing the workers go in and out to the patio, touching money and plates of food without washing their hands.\n\nWe weren't the only ones who were disappointed with the service. Another customer actually came in and had a loud dispute with the manager about the wait time. What did the manager do? She chuckled! Wow! Then she told him to get out and never come back instead of offering to fix the problem. Finally one of the police officers in the restaurant had to break it up and told the couple to leave. \n\nWhen we got our food, we immediately checked it to find out the fries were COLD. At this point we were confused because we already waited 20 minutes to place our order and 45 minutes for our food, yet the fries were cold. Once I pointed it out to the server, it took another 3 minutes to make a fresh batch. How does that make sense? Not to mention they did ask us for payment before giving us the food... shady!\n\nWould I go back? Uhhh... I think I'll go with NO. That's why I stole a bottle of water... since the water was as cold as the fries. Never again.
