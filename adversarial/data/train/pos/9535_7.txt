XS is still my favorite club in Las Vegas. I've been to Light & Hakkasan and I still love XS! I do however, have a HUGE COMPLAINT which is why I'm taking off 2 stars, the inside of the club reaks of vomit & stinky feet!! I came here the weekend of Nov 1st, and my sister warned me that her last time to XS, she said it smelled like nasty foot odor and throw-up. I didn't believe her and told her it was probably a one time thing (since I've been here so many times and never experienced any foul smells). But, boy was I wrong!!! Right upon entering the club, it stunk so bad I had to plug my nose! I couldn't believe my favorite club has lost its \"classy\" reputation. I am very disappointed so I hope XS reads these comments & decides to clean their carpets or take notice of this and change something! Other than that, I still enjoyed myself because the outdoor of XS is amazing! I like the crowd, I like the ambience and I love the music. Feddie Le Grand was the DJ that night & I had the time of my life. \n\nI still love you XS but PLEASE do something about that raunchy smell inside your club. If you are indeed one of the hottest nightclubs in all of Las Vegas, you have to maintain that standard! \n\nBtw, Light nightclub is also another place that smells like feet (and it's a very new club)! Also, Tryst smells like feet & vomit too. Lol.
