It was date night and his pick, and Caf√© Lalibela was the place he picked. I have never been and was excited to try it out. It's a quite cute little place, we were there on a Friday night around 6pm, and it wasn't too busy. Service was great and friendly. \n\nAfter checking out the menu and asking a few questions I went with a 3 item combo, I picked the alicha sega wat, doro wat, and shiro wat. \n\nI'm not scared of the spicy and I love flavors! The alicha sega wat is a beff stew, tender chunks of beef that has been simmered in a spiced butter, onion, turmeric and other spices. Doro wat is a spicy chicken stew, chicken simmered in spiced butter, red pepper, onion and other spices and the shiro wat is ground peas cooked with berbere, onion, garlic and ginger, and I can tell you everything was just delicious! It comes with forks, but I don't really think your supposed to use them, its served with injera, which is like   a thin dense crepe\/tortilla that is a sourdough bread and you just use that for your fork . I have to say the bread is amazing, loved the sourdough.\n\nThe food has amazing flavors and smells, the taste was equal to what you smell, it just wasn't very eye pleasing, but get over that quickly because its some amazing stuff! It was a great date night, great food can't wait to go back.
