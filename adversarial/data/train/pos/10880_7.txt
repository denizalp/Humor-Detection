The best way to celebrate National Coffee Day is at Press Coffee. This was my first time at this location. I have been to a few locations but this one was my favorite so far. They always have the great staff at Press. Loved the ambiance and patio area at this location. A great way to enjoy your joe when the weather gets cooler. They have a few bench chairs to sit outside.
