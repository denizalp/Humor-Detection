VIP Taxi #7604 in Tempe 602-300-3000 just chased me a mile in his car screaming shit at me!!!\nHe tried to run me off the road a few times as I was trying to escape him, he chased me through a residential area and into a public plaza where I called the coppers!!!\nHe got out of his screaming at me that I had thrown something at his vehicle and that he had it on 2 cameras.\nWhen the cops got there he said he didnt have anything on film, that he \njust got his camera and didnt know how to use it.\nI was on a bicycle and he chased me from Farmer & 5th to Hardy & University!!!
