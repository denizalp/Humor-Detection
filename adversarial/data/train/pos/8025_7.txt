This place is a major disappointment and this review is long overdue. I made reservations to this place based on the chef Pierre Gagnaire's marvelous reviews. The disappointing factor was a bunch of amigos back there cooking. It was a Saturday night in June and there was only a total of 6 tables in an enormous beautiful place. The food was bad.... \n\n2 glasses of Schramberg Blanc de Blanc $52 (ripoff)\n1 bottle of Bien Nacido 2007 Pinot Noir (good)\nPierre's salad appetizer $24 ( it was so so)\nTrio of Foie Gras $38 ( weird looking and didn't finish it) :(\nUSDA Ribeye $60 ( the most disappointing part of the entree! The steak was rubbery and it tasted like it was cooked with Soy sauce!)\nPont Nuef $8 ( forgot what it was)\nMushroom side $8 ( salty)\n\nBill came out to $362 not including tip. Besides the epic view of the strip, this place was just horrible! Should have gone to Guy Savoy....
