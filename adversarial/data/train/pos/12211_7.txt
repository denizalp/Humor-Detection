********************* 1137 ********************* \n\n       Finally I got to write about Guy Savoy, a fan of chef Savoy for years as well as chef  Mathieu Chartron, Guy Savoy protégé  from Guy Savoy Paris, now leading the 2 Michelin Star Guy Savoy at Caesars Palace. Chef Chartron is the youngest head chef on Las Vegas strip leading the prestige kitchen. \n\n    He has been with chef Savoy since he was only 19 in Paris. I met chef Savoy and his wife many times, but this was the second time I met chef Chartron, and the first time walked to his kitchen. It's simply stunning in everything he does. \n\n    Guy Savoy at Caesars Palace has no flowers and his staff doesn't allow to wear colognes because he doesn't want his guests to be distract and disrupt the aroma of his rich food that he serves. How amazing is that?\n\n     The Cognac room was stunning with extravaganza selection to small pour like no other place on the strip; and so the Krug Champagne room, I didn't want to leave this room :-)\n\n\n      They also offer gluten free and vegan items, can you imagine that?\n\n      Instead of the Signature Menu for $260 or Innovation Menu for $350, we decided to go with A La Carte this time, which ended up more than both menu, but it was worth it!\n   \n      The food is amazing, Innovation and signature menus display his top dishes that we got to try again and a few new dishes seasonal.\n\n- 4 amuse bouche before our main courses.\n\n- Bread cart presentation is always fun here, not that I need to eat any more breads\n\n- Foie-Gras \"Bitter Infusion\"  \n\n- Artichoke and Black Truffle Soup, Toasted Mushroom Brioche, and Black Truffle Butter  is TO DIE FOR \n\n- Roasted Turbot in Summer Crust, Smoked Eggplant Purée and Tomato Concassé was exquisite\n\n- Crispy Line Caught French Sea Bass with Delicate Spices - the skin was super crispy flaky and the fish was moist, impressive\n\n- The Wagyu steak and French Rivera lobster dish, special for $260 ouch, but worth every single penny! \n\n- Desserts and to go snack\n\nWINES: I love the wine menu with its own table. I love how traditional the wine list here, unlike to modern places with iPad, let keep it classy in a leather cover where I can go page to page and drooling all over this Wine Spectator Grand Award wine list. Stunning Bordeaux and Champagne selection as well as Cognac, of course! \n\n- 1991 Chateau Troplong Mondot, Saint-Emilion Grand Cru, was a bargain find here for me.\n\n- Ice Wine at $50 per glass, delicious\n\n- 1950 Favilla Vieira Malvasia Madeira $75 be the glass, my kind of dessert was smooth, mocha, creme caramel, coffee, dried orange, nose; complex, very tart citrus, coffee grounds, orange honey on the palate; very long finish. \n\n      The service was impeccable from start to finish. Guy Savoy is truly a fine dining for special occasion, or just because you love finer food and great wines, just a perfect spot for ANY occasion!
