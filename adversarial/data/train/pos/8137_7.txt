Props to this place. I have been driving around for about two months with a stereo that cuts in and out. I stopped bt audio express who told me I'd have to pay forty dollars for a diagnosis and the repair would likely cost $800. They said a new stereo wasn't an option. \n\nDecided to get a second opinion and stopped at Arizona sound. I couldn't gave asked for better no pressure information. Turns out it was the factory stereo and i could have had a new one installed for about two hundred bucks. Granted I threw in a few upgrades. Less than an hour later, I'm no longer singing to myself in the car a cappella. Thanks Arizona sound!!!
