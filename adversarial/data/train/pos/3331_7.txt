This place used to be amazing. I started eating here in late 2007, and they had by far the best General Tso's chicken I've ever had, and very good egg fried rice. Sometime around 2010 it all changed drastically. I've gone back several times since then, and it has not been great, but this last time I went it was just horrible. I ordered the same chicken, but some of the pieces were not cooked through, I had shell in my egg fried rice, and they were both very bland.\n\nIt makes me very sad because there really aren't any good Chinese restaurants on the west side, and to say that I'll never go here again is not something I easily do, but this place is just not worth it anymore.
