I could not locate this place for the life of me. We drove around in a circle and I had to call twice to see where they were located. The place is tiny and it's fitted into one of the hotels that are all gathered in this part of town. \n\nThe gentleman was very nice when I checked in to pick up my rental. Everything went smooth until he showed me the car. All he did was walk me up to the car and gave me the keys. I was confused because I thought we were supposed to do a walk thru to check for damages. I mentioned that and he said he already checked. I guess he was busy and had more important things to do. So he left me with the car...\n\nI had a few issues starting the car and I had to call him back. He was kind enough to guide me and eventually I was on my way. I did like that the car had a full tank of gas and all I needed to do was be on my way. \n\nMy first time driving solo to Vegas was a breeze in the Ford Fusion hybrid I rented. Drop off was easy too. They ended up charging me a penny, which is odd, from my deposit.
