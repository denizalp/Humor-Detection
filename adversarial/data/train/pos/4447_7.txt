***** Review is for summer 2013 Restaurant Week menu *****\n\nI was so glad to look at the Restaurant Week list and see Comme Ça listed.  I've wanted to try this place for a long time now and this made a perfect time to do it.\n\nI went with the 5 course RW menu with the supplemental pan roast of foie gras for an extra charge of $19.\n\nBread was brought out quickly after we ordered and the thick bread sticks were very hot!!!\n\nCourse 1 - I chose the warm asparagus salad.  The salad was a surprise.  On the bottom was the warm asparagus spears.  They were topped with mixed greens and the black truffle salumi was sprinkled on top.  To the side was a poached egg with Hollandaise.  It was an interesting and flavorful way to make a salad.\n\nCourse 2 - I got the roasted bone marrow with oxtail jam.  What delicious food and what a lot to eat!  The roasted bone had some coarsely ground salt on the side and the oxtail jam was a large serving of meat with some greens on top and slices of small toasted bread around the edge of the ramekin that held the jam. \n\nCourse - 3 The supplemental roast of foie gras with vanilla bread pudding, foie gras and a goie gras \"cherry bomb\" was next.  The roasted foie gras was on the vanilla bread pudding and the \"cherry bomb\" was another piece of foie gras with a glacé colored red and a cherry pit coming from the \"cherry bomb.\"  Very tasty and a nice play on the firework.\n\nCourse 4 - Parisian gnocchi with braised lamb neck and goat cheese with some fava beans.  It was good.\n\nCourse 5 - Peach pie with almond streusel and rum raisin ice cream.\n\nThe whole meal was very nice and quite interesting the way the chef planned the food and its presentation. One of the things that stood out were the rich sauces with the food.  There was a lot of effort into getting those tasty sauces with the courses. The items on the RW menu are available from the everyday summer menu but I doubt I would have ordered them as separates if they hadn't been packaged like this for Restaurant Week.\n\nOur server, Sabrina, was a very pleasant woman.  She looked after our table.  It wasn't too hard as last night was a very sparse night even when we left around 7 PM.  It seemed like all the restaurants at that section of the Cosmopolitan were low on customers.\n\nThe kitchen seemed slow.  It took almost 2 hours for this meal, something I'd expect from a multi-course meal at a restaurant when I'm doing a tasting menu of this or more courses.  The wait sometimes was welcomed but then grew too long at other times.\n\nThe views out the windows toward Planet Hollywood and Paris were great!  What more could you want except to be sitting at an outside table.  A nice way to finish Restaurant Week with a meal here and then \"A Streetcar Named Desire\" at a community theatre a few miles from there.\n\nAddendum:  My wife, who's very food challenged and resists trying anything new, ordered the Comme Ça burger, a large burger with cheddar cheese and slaw and a HUGE order of French fries.  She liked it very much and even took a small taste of my bone marrow!  Score one for change!  Sabrina asked when we wanted her burger brought so she wasn't sitting there already long done waiting for me to finish.  She got her burger at my foie gras course and it worked perfectly!
