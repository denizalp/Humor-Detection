This place has a monopoly on high profile stand up comedy in the valley, and they know it. They use that monopoly to their advantage with abusive policies (to the customer) and bad service. Their policies are total crap. \n\nWe recently bought some tickets to a 7PM show and when we found out that we couldn't attend that show, we called and tried to get our tickets swapped to the 9:45PM show. After emailing and calling multiple times (and leaving voicemails), I finally got someone on the line. They went on and on about how there are no refunds  or transfers whatsoever, but then they went on to say that they could check with their supervisor to see if we could exchange our tickets for the 9:45PM show. The person got back to me and said, yes, we could exchange our tickets to the later show, but there would be a $5 transfer charge per ticket. I asked him how they could have a transfer fee if their policy doesn't even allow transfers\/exchanges? He couldn't answer that one, of course. We opted to do the exchange and attended the show.\n\nOnce you get there, you'll note that the place is extremely packed with chairs. They sardine as many people as possible into the venue. Many of the seats and arrangements are uncomfortable in my opinion. Once you are wedged into your seat, you are then reminded that they \"require\" that you purchase 2 drinks during your stay, at highly inflated prices, of course. They don't have hot tea as a beverage option any more (they used to) and I hear the iced tea is $10 a glass. In addition, gratuity is automatically added to your bill, so even if your service is bad, your server gets a tip anyway!\n\nI love stand up comedy, but I despise this place. I won't be attending their shows and dealing with their heavy handed, turnip squeezing tactics.
