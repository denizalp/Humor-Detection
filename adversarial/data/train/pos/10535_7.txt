Tried for the first time today... Had Chicken Egg Foo Young and Shrimp Fried Rice... The Fried rice was edible, nothing to brag about. However the Chicken Egg Foo Young I was HIGHLY disappointed in... much of the outside parts were burnt. I tried mixing the gravy in and some of the rice to mask it, but it didn't work. Wish I could give a better review. Maybe some other time.
