The location is great and the food is yummy.  There's nothing better than reserving a chair by the pool then sauntering over to the shaded and cool area to get a nice base to start off the day =)\n\nOrdered the Spanish Scramble, which came with organic eggs,  tasty chorizo, onions, tomatoes, cheese, and some country potatoes.  Also had some of the strong and good coffee.  Great way to start the day.  Service is competent, but nothing special.\n\nOn the way out, however, had to get one of their yard-length frozen drinks.  The cocktail waitresses by the pool don't sell these; you gotta get them from Riva or from the bar in the Ventian Retail shops area.  Got the Lava Flow, I think for 18 buck, with refills being cheaper. Super sweet, for sure, but hey, doctor it up with a bit (or a flask) of your own rum, and poolside just got better =)\n\nI'd totally eat here again.  Great location and nice atmosphere.
