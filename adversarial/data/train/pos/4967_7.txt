This is one of my first picks when I'm in the area and craving Asian food. The service is quick and friendly, there was no wait at all.\n\nYou are given two choices: shabu shabu or sukiyaki. My friend recommended the sukiyaki, so i've always stuck with it. You get a pretty good sized meal for just $14.99. That comes with a medium-sized plate of veggies (greens, mushrooms, slices of carrots), really thinly sliced meat of your choice (highly recommend the beef or lamb), with a self-cook pan where you pour in their delicious soup base!\n\nDefinitely will come here again on my next visit to Vegas!
