The Root is a great, reasonably priced hair salon in Phoenix. The stylists are extremely well trained and very knowledgeable as to their products and trade. The owner is Lauren Hart and I have been going to her for about 12 years now. Every time I leave her salon my hair looks amazing. She has been doing hair for more than 20 years and you can tell. Lauren and her staff continuously go to classes and hair shows to stay up to date on the latest trends and technologies in hair. Everyone that works there does an amazing job and they are all so friendly and upbeat. \n\nThe decor is very minimal and everything is extremely clean. There is really cool artwork everywhere that is all for sale and changes periodically. The salon is really a place you can go relax and enjoy yourself. I recommend this salon to everyone I know because the staff is very professional, knowledgeable and friendly. I know how hard it is to find someone to do a great job on my hair and I have been fortunate to find this salon. \n\nIf you are new to the area or just need a new stylist, The Root has what you are looking for. They specialize in color correction and they really do have the client's best interest in mind. They also offer some waxing services, deep conditioning, and they carry a wide variety of products. \n\nOne tip, call ahead. Because they are so good at what they do, you need to book your appointment in advance, especially if you want to get in with Lauren. Also, they are closed on Sundays.
