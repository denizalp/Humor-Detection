Lobby, Lobby, Lobby you spoiled me.  Your burgers are so good.  I walked in and was instantly warmly greeted at the counter.  The young man took my order with a smile and sense of humor.  I love that!  I ordered a bacon chesse burger with provolone.  When I unwrapped it I knew I had found near perfection.  The burger was on a fresh sesame bun, the bacon was nice and crisp but not over done and the cheese.....oh the cheese.....it was melted over the burger.  9 times out of 10 when you get a cheese burger it looks like they just slapped the cheese on right before they put the rest of the toppings on so it's not melted.  In my mind the cheese should be melted down the sides of the burger, not an afterthought to be slapped on at the last minute.  I took a bite and the burger was juicy and cooked perfectly, just a tiny bit pink inside.  Ahhhh!!  I also got crinkle cut fries and they were perfectly cooked as well and not greasy at all.  Lobby's has a secret sauce....you must get a side of the secret sauce to dip your fries in....YUM!!!  The soda cups are a generous size and free refills are included.  \n\nThe whole place was clean and well lit.  You can see them cooking too.  Lobby, yes that is his real name, was there running the show and making sure his customers were happy.  I hear the Italian Beef sandwich is to die for so I will try that next.  I'm gonna have to psych myself into it though cause that burger was so darn good!  \n\nThank you Lobby!!!  I'll be back soon!!
