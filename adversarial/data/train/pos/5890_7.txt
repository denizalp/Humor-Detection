This guy has his own Yelp review page?! He's been at that Yonge and Dundas corner for probably close to 20 years now! He's very dedicated to preaching the bible as I've been told by my sister that he's there EVERYDAY! \n\nWe walked past him one and right when my sister passed in front of him, he yelled Jesus really loud as he lifted his arm and it scares the crap out of sister LOL. It was real hilarious to watch her jump and bump into a nearby stranger. \n\nHe's definitely a Toronto landmark :)
