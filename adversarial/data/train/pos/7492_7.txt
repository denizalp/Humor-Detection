DISCLAIMER: I AM VEGETARIAN\n\nI came here for lunch while craving a vegetarian burger. I know burger joints aren't known for vegetarian burgers, and frankly most places just throw some sort of dry black bean patty on the menu and call it a vegetarian option, but I find it refreshing when burger places have multiple vegetarian options for their patrons. That being said, the Burger Bar had a decent vegetarian patty on their menu. It was comprised of unique ingredients like peas and potatoes, it was soft and moist and although I felt like my patty needed some salt, it masked by the ingredients within my burger. \n\nMy $9.95 vegetarian burger included a leaf of romaine lettuce, a slice of tomato and a slice of onion. Everything else is extra!! Cheese: 0.95, avocado: 1.75, aioli: 0.75. I also ordered a side of sweet potato fries for 3.65 and paid an extra 0.75 for aioli with my fries. I paid about $24 for a vegetarian burger and a side of fries with tax and tip.\n\nI'm all for paying for great food and exceptional service, but I hate over paying for mediocre food and okay service. I feel like Hubert Keller nickel and dimed me for a lackluster burger and I'm not pleased.\n\nI wouldn't come back.
