They should remake the food selections ASAP\n\nPros:\n* Locating in Cosmopolitan\n* Their desert is the only thing good there\n* They put many of their food in small cup\/pan\/pot\n\nCons:\n* For the subpar food selection they offer right now, $40+\/person is a ripoff (Don't come here if you like seafood, their selection is very limited; they use crab legs the same level as those in $15-$20 asian buffet places)\n* Most of their food doesn't taste like $40+ buffet, it was so plain and basic\n* Their ambiance\/decor can be considered \"OK\" if it locates elsewhere not name Cosmopolitan, but for such an upscale trendy hotel like Cosmopolitan, Wicked Spoon should spend a little more money on the restaurant's \"vibe\"\n* Our waiter was discriminative. (After being seated, our server walked by our table couple times but never acknowledge us to ask what would we like to drink. Then when two other parties were seated after us, he went to their table almost immediately)
