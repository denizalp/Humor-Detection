Mirage, I like you.  You're location is central and walkable to\/from everywhere.  Your rooms are clean.  Your service is nice.  And your ambience is new while still being old school strip.   Between the dolphin habitat for the kids and Bare pool lounge for the adults, there is something for everyone there.  The many choices of restaurants, shopping, lounges both there and close to them make the Mirage a solid choice for a Vegas weekend.
