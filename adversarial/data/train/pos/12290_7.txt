My friend has a BMW and had engine issues while we were in Phoenix this weekend. She checked around, figured out the problem from her mechanic in LA and then purchased parts here. She was directed to Scott's Auto Werks through a referral from a friend. With the good Yelp rating, she felt comfortable bringing her baby here. \n\nRay, the manager, was very accommodating and friendly. He was happy to get to work on her car immediately and use the parts she had purchased. One hour later, we were ready to go! Ray put a new spark plug in, just in case, and gave her the 5% discount offered on the check in deal. \n\nOverall, we were both happy with the service but my friend did say that Ray should have given us a verbal estimate of the cost of the service prior to performing the repair. I'm sure this was just an oversight. I would recommend this mechanic to BMW owners.
