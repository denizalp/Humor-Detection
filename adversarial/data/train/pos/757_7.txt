Stay Away! These are not the musicians that in earlier years graced the world with angelic children singing Christmas prayers to Pachelbel's Canon in D. This is a show in which the musicians spend more time turning their heads to throw their hair over their shoulder than listening to the balance between the limited orchestra and their instruments and voices. Even the light show could not make up for the sophomoric performance. We fled midway through the performance when it was clear that a grade school concert would have more musical value. What a waste of time and money.
