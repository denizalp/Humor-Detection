This review  is actually for Moxie's (used to be Kimmy's).\n\nFirst off, same sour, crappy waitress that worked at Kimmy's. The waitress' \"special mix\" bloody mary tasted like high fructose corn syrup crap. Water was never replenished. My steak was like a dead body,- no seasonings and was pale (wtf?). I ordered herbed potatoes as a side, but when my food was brought to me she threw it down and said, \"the potatoes are not ready yet so I substituted fries\". I hate fries! Why would you arbitrarily do that??\nWhen the manager asked if everything was ok and we complained, all he said was that was a bummer. Yeah, tell the owner when this dump shuts down here in a month that it was a bummer. \n\nPiss poor.
