On a whim we tried this place a few visits ago when we came to china town. It had four stars at the time and I never thought to check the reviews on yelp which are mixed reviews anyway. \n\nI am always wanting to try milk tea but am afraid i won't like it. I absoulutely am obsessed with taro so I ordered a taro milk tea and a taro boba. Both were lacking in taro flavor. Very disappointing. We should have Gone elsewhere. Boo you Volcano Tea house. Nothing volcanic or exciting about your drinks at all.
