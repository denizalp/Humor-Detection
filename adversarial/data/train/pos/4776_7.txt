I don't like this one the only thing I like bout it is the selecton other then that DON\"t go here it stinks like rotten old fish and meat like they don't take care it. It's super old looking like from 1940 or something REMODEL plase u make all that money off the poor people in the nieghborhood I'm poor too. The ceiling looks like crap like there been several water leaks. And the frozen area had brown stuff in the back of the cooler gross. It's to bad Idon't have vehicle other wise  i would go somewhere else. I jus dont buy meat here or anything that is not sealed or in a can.
