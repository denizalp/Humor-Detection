10\/10 ALWAYS COME HERE FOR EBC AT NIGHT. \n\nEBC is one of the only clubs that are open in the middle of the week and they certainly make it worth the visit because their talent is usually very stacked during this time in the summer. \n\nLike all clubs in Vegas, never pay to get in because you can always get comped entry if you come with an even ratio group (depending on arrival time and artist playing that night of course).\n\nEBC typically gives out 2 free drink tickets per girl in the group as well, and this ticket lasts until guest list closes so you'll want to head to the bar in the back of the club as soon as you get in. \n\nTowels are provided here and the atmosphere is pretty lax. You've got a wide array of daybeds, cabanas, booths, waterbeds, and lily pads. \n\nEBC is also the only pool club that has pool floaties so you'll get to take your beloved photos with your swan and pizza if it isn't already taken!\n\nThe guest list line usually closes early unless it's a weekday and they TYPICALLY cycle quickly unless it's a weekend because they'll try to push everyone to pay to get in (pretty shady, but it's a business.)\n\nIf you're cool enough to get onstage, keep in mind that the space is relatively small even though the back end of it is Surrender Nightclub. \n\nOverall, I do love this club and have fond memories here. I would always recommend this to anyone looking to have a good time in Vegas. \n\n(30\/100 - 2018)
