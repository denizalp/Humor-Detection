These guys are great. I try and stay as objective as possible while writing these but man, you really can't beat NWO in my book!\n\nI remember the first time I tried the food at the Cotswold Food Truck Rally and it was as close to 'love at first sight' gets for a burrito bowl. My go-to: Mongolian Steak bowl. Marinated steak served on a bed of rice with a savory sauce, peppers, CARAMELIZED onions, and broccoli. The rice, consistently perfect; the broccoli, always crisp and flavorful. Onions are actually caramelized, not burnt, or saut√©ed until shriveled, or however else people try and interpret caramelized, they give a real complex dimension to the whole bowl.\n\nOthers I have tried are the Dirty South and Mediterranean style but you should always check out the window and ask about the special styling. A couple of months ago they did a Mole sauce that was outstanding. Not too spicy but a perfect compliment to the steak. Check out the Wonchos as well for some crunchy wonton chips with big, bold flavor combinations.\n\nThe crew does a great job cranking out delish food FAST. They're catering experts and even have 2 trucks to serve the Charlotte metro. They have a few usual spots throughout the week (NASCAR plaza Wednesday, one of the Food Truck Rallies on Friday) but are subject to change due to private events or venue change of plans etc. Fortunately they are really good at putting their weekly schedule up on the usual social media sites. Keep track of them on Facebook or Twitter.\n\nFor the quality, variety, and price, it really is the whole package in a truck. Look for me if you see the truck, I'll probably be somewhere nearby licking my bowl clean!
