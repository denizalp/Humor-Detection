So excited to review one of my favourite creative spots in Calgary.\n\n4cats studio offers painting, pottery, polymer clay sculpting, and other arts classes for adults, family, and children. We have done a polymer clay class and a ice cream bowl(pottery)class. Both were super enjoyable and their staff were amazing. I found that the small classes they offer are very informative, fun-filled, and affordable. They do 2 for 1 class deals which are such a good price for what you learn and you get to take home the product you make. \n\nWhen I was last there, which was when I did the pottery bowl class with my husband - I was pregnant and I was seriously excited for my baby to come out as soon as possible so she can start growing up and participating in these art classes. That's how much we liked being there!\n\nIf you are in a rush, but want to do some art stuff at home, you can pop in and grab some of their polymer clay kits which are super cute and easy to make. \n\nI definitely recommend 4cats to everyone who is looking for some creative outlet, but dont want to spend a ton of money for in depth art classes.
