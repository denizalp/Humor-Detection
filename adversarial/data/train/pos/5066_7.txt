What can I say? This is a bank. Well, it's better, because it's a credit union. Better returns, dividends and typically better customer service.\n\nI only use the drive through at this location. The parking lot and turn in for the drive through are horrible. The wait is usually pretty long. They still use deposit slips, which is antiquated, but the associated costs aren't passed on to us, so it's a good\/bad thing. You can't see through the window to see who is talking at you, which weirds me out. The staff have always been friendly though.\n\nThe location is pretty old, but it is clean and well-staffed. Given that my local branch closed down, I am glad that they are still here...for myself, and for the employees.
