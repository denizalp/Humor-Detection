I paid $37 to see two attractions with a fast pass assuming the fast pass would be... well fast. Upon arrival I was still herded into an endless line just to confirm that I had already purchased my tickets. I and many others around me were just as frustrated and annoyed at pointlessly purchasing online only to wait in line for far too long. Entering the \"park\" was wildly underwhelming considering the financial investment. There was limited signage, lazy actors and overall the experience was extremely disorganized and poorly designed. I write this yelp review as I stand in the third separate line for the zombie paintball attraction. Going on hour.. two by now I'm sure. Had I known I was going to pay 37 dollars to stand uncomfortable in line and experience a few short minutes of entertainment I would rather have eaten the filthy bills and die from infection. This has been the worst haunted house experience of my life and if I could sell my soul to get these hours back I would. \n\nI would give it zero stars but that's not an option, now is it?\n\nUPDATE an hour or so later. \nAfter nearly two hours of a line I got on the truck for the zombie paintball whatever they pretended it would be. Surprise we get out there and there was only one real person. Our feeble truck host apologized saying they were probably on break. I'm really glad I waited so long to shoot at absolutely nothing.\n\nWhat an absolute waste of money.
