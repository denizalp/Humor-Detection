I took my coat to this dry cleaner which I have been patron of since it opened.   The lady at the counter said she couldn't tell me what the coat would cost to be cleaned but said the maximum would be $20.  When I picked up the coat the amount was $25. She told me that to her recollection she had said that the pricing would start at $20.  I called the main store and asked to speak with the owner.  The man who answered said \"I could speak with him\".   I asked who he was meaning was he the owner, supervisor? His response was his name and \"who are you\".  I told him what had happened and he did call to talk to the woman in the store.  He said she admitted she wasn't quite sure what she had said to me.   He told me to go back into the store and she would return five dollars. \n\nI thanked him and then asked if it was true this satellite store would not know the price until after the coat was cleaned.  I have always left there knowing how much the item would cost.  At this point his voice started rising.  He said coats are hard to clean and gave me the impression that mine was quite dirty and they had done a lot to clean it. He also indicated that the woman was a long-term employee and said that he believed she had not told me that it would not be over $20 even though he previously said that she wasn't sure what she had told me. At this point I felt that whether I continued to be a customer was of no concern to him.  I told him that in my opinion the conversation had really deteriorated and that I didn't feel right about taking his $5.  I lost five dollars and they lost a customer.  I would suggest to anyone considering going to this store or any store that they don't leave an item unless there is a price assigned to it in writing or at least a price range.
