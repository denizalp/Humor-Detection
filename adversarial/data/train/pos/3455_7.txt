My review is strictly based on the nightlife scene, not the venue as a restaurant. When you walk up the entrance, you get carded by a security guy.  The two different ones I've seen were both nice.  There are hostesses as you walk in, and most of the previous reviews nailed it when they described the hostesses as spacey and just not all there.  Now when I go, I just bypass them and go in and find a seat at the bar.  \n\nThe first night I was in here, they had JUSt opened and it was beyond crazy.  Luckily our bartender, Khara, was superb and fast and we never really had to wait long for drinks.  The second night I came with a big group and hung out in the patio area, which was awesome!  The bar was consistently slammed but as we waited people eventually left, opening up seats at the bar.  I think for such a busy place, they could probably do without seats at the bar, but it worked for us!  The bartender was awesome and got us our first round.  It was kind of slow to get drinks, but not moreso than anywhere else that is extremely packed. \n\nOverall, I think McFadden's is a great place to come when you want to go out drinking with your friends and don't feel like venturing out to the Strip.  It's always good to meet people.  It's fun and crazy and casual. I like it!
