Horrible ER experience!  It is unfortunate that those who have health ins are treated so poorly when it comes to asking for help.  My husband took his 80 yr old mother in for the second time due to a severe back condition that is in the process of diagnosis.  After two days of not sleeping and being crumpled on the floor my husband took her back to the ER for help and to ask for an MRI.  They told her flat out no and asked him why they were there in the first place.  The Dr. was extremely rude and condescending.  The nurse admitted to insurance red tape and the reason for not allowing the MRI...They were there for 6 hours and she left with a morphine injection.  Terrible terrible place!  Unfortunately we are often restricted to where we can go in an emergency.  Just be aware that this facility is not where you want to go if you are looking for comfort!
