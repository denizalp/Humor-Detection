I'm half Filipina and, growing up, my mom's friend owned a turo turo restaurant. This is the stuff my childhood dreams are made of!\n\nMy favorite thing in the whole world is adobo pusit (squid saut√©ed in garlic and squid ink and whatever else makes it amazing). They have it but I have to call and see (I don't think it's daily). \n\nI got bangus and it had NO BONES (what the what? ) I was able to eat while driving with my hands (not proud of that particular moment, but it happened, so there). \n\nThe Lechon is literally the best I've ever had, ever. Takes me back to the days of family parties and a giant roast pig on the table with an apple in its mouth, feeling slightly sorry for it, but standing right by and eating its back with my hands. Sorry, tmi. \n\nI host my daughter's bday party once a year and they cater and deliver. Everyone raves about the skewers. BBQ Chicken or pork. No matter how many skewers or lechon or lumpia I order, I run out. Which is bad, but yay. Means they enjoyed. I order food for 100 people and have a party for 50, those babies will be gone. And everyone asks where I got the food. \n\nSo yeah. It's not fancy, and, like my own Filipino family, they're very matter of fact...but it's my fav in town.
