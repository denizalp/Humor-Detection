Im very torn writing this review.  Some things were really good, others not so much.  This is one of the first times I wish for 1\/2 stars to give them a 3.5 rating.  \nTheir pricing is cheaper than other cleaners in the area and scheduling is super easy through their website.  My cleaner showed up on time and got straight to work.  I was scheduled for a 2.5 hour cleaning for my one bedroom, one bathroom condo.  She spent the first hour dedicated to cleaning my kitchen and seemed to rush through the rest of the house to finish on time. Even though I don't live in a mansion, I think more than one cleaner would have been better.  Overall, most of my house got pretty clean, but other areas were skipped all together, like some of the baseboards, and my bedroom ceiling fan, though she cleaned the living room one.  \n\nOne note to Homejoy; since my cleaning I have received a text message on how the cleaning was and FOUR emails asking me to write them a Yelp review.  Honestly, if I want to write a review, then I will! Stop begging for the reviews, it almost made me not want to write this one.
