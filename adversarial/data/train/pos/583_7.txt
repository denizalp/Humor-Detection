Please... I hope management realizes that their customer service need more attention. Just can't be friendly when clients come in. Mistakes do happen but it would be more appreciated if you admit to them. Staff was so guilty, they pretty much avoided passing by our table. \n\nOtherwise, Smuckers strawberry jam was on point. Food was just alright.
