All the reviews are great, but that was not my experience.\nYes, Chris the son is great and runs the front along with his\nmother who is charming and friendly. Charles the owner is \nthe problem. I have been going here for 4 years but will tell you\nabout the last encounter. I had a front light burn out which required taking the bumper off to change - Charles replaced only 1 light. The lights come in a set of 2. When I called Charles to say that I had expected that he would replace both lights - he said when the 2nd one went -he wouldn't charge labour. I didn't forget that. Why would anyone\nnot replace both lights when the bumper was already off? When the second light burned out - I made an appointment. He didn't remember replacing the first one and I hadn't reminded him yet. I clearly heard him go in the back and ask Chris if they had the lights in stock - \"yes, they come in a set\" said Chris.\nWe are only replacing one said Charles. He was going to do it again -\nmake me pay for taking the bumper off twice. Think! He hadn't remembered that he had already done this to me once. \nIf Charles is so great at looking after his customers and saving them money, then why would he make sure that a loyal customer had to come in twice to take off a bumper and change a lightbulb. He was NOT pleased with me when I reminded him that he had said he would not charge me for labour.\nIt is my experience that if someone is consistently honest with the little\nthings, then they will be honest with the big things. \nAs I said, I had been going to that shop for 4 years - having oil changes\nand for many problems which occurred right after the oil changes.\nThe shop is NOT transparent and charges are by the book - even if the\nrepair takes a lot less time.
