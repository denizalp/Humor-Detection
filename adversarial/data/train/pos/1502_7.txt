So much better than Subway or the other pretenders.\n\nA 9-inch sandwich for $6.75 is awesome and more than enough food, and not just a bread filler.  Locally owned, I met the guy today at lunch and actually told him about Yelp so he'll be checking his reviews out, but he was really nice as were the guys taking orders and making the food.  This place gets busy at lunch as the business people around know where to eat when it's good.  I've heard a few of my cop buddies say how good it is too and they weed out all the bad places pretty quick.\n\nAnyways, the sandwiches are really good and all the meat, cheeses and all the fixin's are really fresh and always plentiful on your sandwich.\n\nAnd look for the \"Bobby\"... It's like your whole Thanksgiving dinner exploding in your mouth... turkey, stuffing and cranberry sauce... I'm serious it's so good.\n\nEnjoy guys... it's really good food for a great price.
