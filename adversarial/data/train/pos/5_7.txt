Well, it does have an amazing pool, and if you have an urge to get steamy with forty eight close friends, the hot tub is unparalleled.\n\nAnd those are the reasons I didn't give this place two stars.\n\nMajor Defect #1: Hidden resort fees.  Seriously, this is not a resort.  Stop charging a \"resort\" fee.  Especially do not attribute the fee to the free parking (which is available on any street corner in that part of town), or to the \"minibar\" (which consists of an extremely limited, unsavory selection of candy bars and chips for sale at the front desk).  For a $69 room, a $20 resort fee is unacceptable, even if you're in the Bahamas...which the Clarendon is not.\n\nMajor Defect #2: Horror movie lighting.  Our fluorescent bathroom lightbulb started ominously flickering five minutes into our stay.  If we had brought fake blood, we could have filmed a low-budget slasher flick.  No maintenance on duty, either--we had to change rooms.\n\nMajor Defect #3: Assorted clutter on rooftop patio.  Stacks of bricks, cigarette butts, beer empties, drunken, partially clothed guests crossing the NC-17 line.  Combine with unattractive, insufficient lighting, and you have an injury waiting to happen.  Or, at a minimum, a highly unromantic setting.\n\nMajor Defect #4: Ice machines?  Anyone??\n\nMajor Defect #5: General scuzz.  The restaurant and front lobby were shiny, but the rest of the place--rooms included--needed a serious upgrade.  And a mopping.  With bleach.\n\nFortunately, I brought some very lovely company with me and quickly forgot about both the setting and the damage that \"resort fee\" did to my pocketbook.  If I go to the Clarendon again, however, it will only be for the food, booze, and pool.
