Bree (sorry if I spelled your name wrong) was friendly and personable. I love patronizing a business with friendly folks... why give my hard eared money to meanies.\nThis little market has a small produce area and a nice selection of pantry items to go along with their coffee bar\/pizza kitchen\/sandwich counter\/salad bar. Most items are comparable to local grocery store prices.\nIt is a great place to stop and grab a quick sandwich and Peet's coffee when you are on the go downtown.\nAs of 8\/26\/2015, they have a Yelp check in offer for a free coffee (Yep, Peet's!) with purchase. \nThey also have a sandwich special that is $5.00 for a pre-made sandwich, chips and canned soda. Hello, bargain lunch!\n\nThey also carry freshly made cookies that are too huge and was under priced and a few varieties of the nearby O Face Donuts.
