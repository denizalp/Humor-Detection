As every comment posted, harassment level high. Ask for directions big mistake. Can't just tell you what you want to know. Air conditioning in room sucked. Did not blow cold and this was winter. Had it been 100 degree summer day.... \nTub shower moldy caulk. Nice steamy hot water so I give 2 stars for that. \nFood was convenient without long lines but mediocre buffet for breakfast and dinner with a high price to pay. \nAlas you receive a 2 for 1 coupon for one time use but that is because you are charged a ridiculous resort fee. \nBe sure not to drink that bottle of water they do kindly left for you. $4.00 charge for that bottle of water. \nAt 10:45 pm the maid opened our door even though we had the do not disturb card in the keycard slot. Lucky my husband did not shoot the intruder because we were in bed. \nRoom cleaning at 11 at night  WTF!
