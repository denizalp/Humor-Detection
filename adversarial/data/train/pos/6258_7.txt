Back in 2007, my car (BMW 540i sport) was involved in a minor accident and one of the front rims was damaged (18\" M Parallel). The bodyshop (whom I had a working relationship with as I am a former auto dealer) outsourced finding a replacement to Wheel Specialists. Wheel Specialists sent the body shop a replica M Parallel. The rim was obviously a replica as the lip was slightly different, the color was slightly different, and the rim lacked the OEM BMW markings. Getting an OEM rim was very important as the OEM rims were forged and the replica was not. I told the bodyshop I would handle the mix up. I went to wheel specialists directly to handle the situation and I dealt with Brad. He was a gigantic asshole. He refused to admit the rim was a replica. He basically told me I didn't know what I was talking about (even though I specialized for years in BMW's). Even when I pointed out obvious differences (lack of a part #, differences in appearance, etc), he wouldn't budge. The attitude I got from him was \"leave me alone, go away, and let me get back to buying underage girls vodka-tonics in Scottsdale with my d-bag friends.\" Needless to say, I eventually gave up. I recently went back to wheel specialists to look at some Vossen rims. They gave me a competitive quote, but I used a different shop because of my previous experience with them. Had something gone wrong, I doubted they would have fixed it.
