Same average food tourist trap as all the other Hard Rocks I've been to. \n\nThis place is really, really small. They do make really good drinks though. What really pissed me off was every time I went to the bar to get a drink I kept getting carded. I know I look young, but damn! I am over thirty! \n\nWhat this place has going for it is location and that's about it. \n\nGo to The Melting Pot instead, you'll be much happier!
