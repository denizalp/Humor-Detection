There's nothing really special here.\n\nThe service is slow at the bar and the tables, the place is crowded with Affliction\/Ed Hardy T-shirt wearing type guys.  The music is truly terrible dance-pop nonsense.  The food is forgettable without being bad: think Chilis or Outback.  \n\nOn the plus side, they do have some good beers available.  But this is Pittsburgh, and that's not unusual at all.  In fact, you can walk a few blocks, say to Bites and Brews or Harris Grill and get an even better selection, usually for the same price or better.
