I've been to three events so far at the T-Mobile Arena, and have sat in Section 5 all three times because I liked it so much the first time.  Not just because I thought the seats had a great view, but I also enjoyed the Jack Daniel's Lounge.  I had no idea that sections 5 and 6 entered the seating area through the Jack Daniels Lounge before my 1st event here, but I chose that section specifically because of it the second and third time.  \n\nIt's nice to have designated bathrooms and bar\/food areas specifically for your section, although during an intermission, the lines do get crazy long!  Also, you're still paying $18 for a cocktail, so don't think you're getting any discounts in here. It's the same as in the rest of the Arena.
