I was visiting a friend in AZ and decided to get a haircut. Based on another reviews this place is a go. I was not disappointed. Great haircut, friendly atmosphere and I liked the feel of a boutique salon. It's super cute there. I recommended this hair salon to my friend who lives there and she was also happy with her haircut. It's kind of confusing to find it but Marlo called me and explained how to find it.
