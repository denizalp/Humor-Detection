Well everyone has heard of subway....\n\nWhat makes this one different? The lack of care and the assembly line like atmosphere in making anyone's sub.\n\nIt seems like they don't refrigerate their food (caught them removing food clearly from yesterday at 7am to make way for the breakfast stuff.\n\nIf that alone wasn't concerning, the fact there isn't a single staff that seems to listen or lack the technical know-how to put together a sub...\n\nIf anything a franchise should have standards for everything including the people they hire however that isn't happening here \n\nOH just in case you were wondering this steak cheese was an assault on my nostrils and my pallet...thank you subway another $8.00 wasted
