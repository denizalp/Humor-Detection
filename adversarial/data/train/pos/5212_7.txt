I'm not sure where to start. This was my first experience at any downtown restaurant in Phoenix. Food was good, service seemed to be good and all of a sudden our lunch was ruined. There were four of us and my back was to  the kitchen. One of my coworkers pointed out a roach coming out of the kitchen to the cash register area. As we set and watched we saw at least three roaches. The place was so packed I didn't want to mention it to a waitress or anyone. I was worried it would alert everyone inside the restaurant. \n\nAs we left we all became angrier as the day passed by. I tried to call and could not communicate with the woman who answered. After googling the health hazards of roaches I was disgusted and worried that this place would allow this problem to affect their customers. I decided to post in on yelp, against what I would typically do, because I am concerned about the health hazards. I called the county health inspectors and they told me they were already familiar with the problem and were encouraging the restaurant to get it fixed asap. I'm disappointed I don't know more people to warn. The place seemed to be a place that stays packed most of the day.
