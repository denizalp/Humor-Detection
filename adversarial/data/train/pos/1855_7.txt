Don't give thanks here.\nIt's been a while since I've posted, but for anyone who can't remember,  see my motto above. And I get even more pissed when it's expensive bad food! \n\nSo imagine my mood when we left Quiessence yesterday having dropped $171 for 2, (including tax & tip), on a meal that  was certainly worse than what I could make at home.\nI had the Date & Beet Salad, the Turkey entree, and the Apple Crisp for dessert. Served family style were, greens, Sausage & Onion stuffing, Roasted Carrots & Parsnips, Mashed Potatoes, and a bread basket.\n\nI'll start from the beginning with the salad which was OK. Not what you'd expect for the price, but acceptable. The turkey was brined in an over salted liquid with something odd added. It was moist, but I still left slices on my plate the flavor was so odd.\n\nThe stuffing had very little flavor at all & was dry. The sausage added nothing but meat so  that the vegetarians couldn't eat it. The mashed potatoes were also over salted. The carrots & parsnips were severely undercooked. Hard as rocks. Or maybe they were overcooked & dehydrated, since a few of them were mush. The greens were good. All of the side dishes were left over. There were 3 kinds of bread in the basket; a dry foccacia, corn bread, & a soaked, with oil or butter, corn bread. They all seemed like they were from the previous day, & someone had tried to save them.\n\nWe all had the Apple Crisp with Cranberry Ice Cream for dessert. It was also OK.  The Crisp was good, but needed lemon juice to cut the sweetness. The ice cream was an Iron Chef moment.  Not a good one. I removed as much as I could & poured a little cream, supplied for the coffee, on my crisp. Oh, for some vanilla Hagen-Dazs!\n\nWe were tired of counting pennies, and thought we'd splurge. We'd all been to Quiessence before, when there was a different chef. It's a lovely location, but not enough to make up for the food. \nOn the day that I usually give thanks for the bounty of life,  I started planning Thanksgiving dinner for next year.
