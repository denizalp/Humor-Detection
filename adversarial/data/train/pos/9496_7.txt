In the area this morning, I checked my trusty Yelp app to see what I had bookmarked in the area to give me an idea for breakfast. I noticed Chocolate & Spice and was excited to check it out after all the great reviews since they opened. \n\nBrowsing through the reviews and quick tips, I focused in on the strawberry rhubarb pie that Holly C recommended. I'm a sucker for pie, tarts and torts. Anything with a pie crust has my heart and add some sour and sweet and it's bliss. \n\nThe crust was absolutely perfect. Crumbly and crispy on the edges, just how I like it. The strawberry rhubarb filling was perfection. Tangy and fruity, with a great texture.I can't wait to come back to try some more of their sweet and savory options, but I'll have to get another bite of that strawberry rhubarb as well!
