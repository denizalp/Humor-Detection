Holy guacamole!\nEat your heart out, La Comida.  Your tiny $11 guac had nothing on my 3x the size guac with chips for $2.05 here!\n\nRandal R. and I went as first timers today for lunch.  We walked in through the seating area and found our way to the other side to look at the menu.  I ordered a grilled shrimp taco and 2 lengua tacos to start.  Randal R. ordered 5 different ones (carne asada, al pastor, lengua, buche, and the May special chicharron with pickled onions).  He got Mexican Pepsi, I got Mexican coke.\n\nWe were given a freshly roasted plate of green onions and jalapeno, but were chased by a cook with a steaming plate of grilled onions which were amazing with a squeeze of lime.  The salsa bar was stocked with radishes, limes, cucumbers, steaming hot beans, and 8 salsas.  I started off by grabbing the 3 green salsas.  I love green anything (except celery) so this was great, a trifecta!\n\nI had the shrimp first - stuffed with grilled shrimp, avocado, lettuce - sooo tasty.  Then, the lengua - it had tomatillo salsa on it along with cilantro and diced onion.  I added a squeeze of lime and some of the fresh bright green salsa too.  Perfection.  Juicy, tender, zingy...thank goodness I had 2!\n\nThen we decided we needed to do a salsa tasting - I got an order of chips and guac on the cheap and then got all 8 salsas lined up.  My fave was definitely the bright deep green one.  The habanero salsa had a warning but was not very spicy to me.  I really liked my meal and would definitely come back.
