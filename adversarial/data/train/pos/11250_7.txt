This place is definitely inexpensive, and rather authentic, even down the to lower quality meat that you'd expect, but hope not for, in the dishes.\n\nThe reviews are so great here though, so I may have just ordered the wrong things: We ordered the Soon Tofu Soup with Pork and the Spicy Pork Bulgogi on metal plate.\n\nThe Tofu soup had chunks of pork that were 60% gristle and some of which had tough spots that tasted like bone. I had to spit out several pieces because I couldn't chew through them. I've never had this experience at a Korean joint and this is somewhere between number 20-40 of Korean places that I've eaten in. So, not an expert, but well versed in the Soon Tofu soup.\n\nI had some trouble communicating my desire for a raw egg for my soup, but it was eventually understood, and gladly brought out.\n\nThe spicy pork...I have no idea what that was. It was unlike anything that I have ever been served at a korean place. Here's the thing, all the ingredients were there, though it was LOADED with vegetables instead of pork, but the flavor was COMPLETELY off. There was no spiciness to it, it was just sweet, and in a really weird sweetness way. I had two bites and couldn't eat any more of it. \n\nThe wait staff was very kind, they asked if everything was OK when I asked for the pork boxed up after not eating any of it. I didn't have the heart to tell them that the pork was wretched.\n\nI gave the food to a homeless person after leaving the place.\n\nThe last thing of note was that I was the only non-asian in the restaurant. That's a good thing, frankly. It makes me think that I just ordered the wrong things...
