I'm actually convinced that every positive review on yelp is by someone who works at Glory of India, because if you're looking for authentic Indian cuisine and roti, this is probably the last place you should go. \n\nThe butter chicken sauce comes out of a jar, guaranteed. The curry sauce is far too oily, and separates in between bites. These are just not good dishes. \n\nI grew up with Indian and Pakistani friends, whose families often invited me for homemade dinners. I have gone to just about every descent Indian restaurant in the GTA with these same friends. This is far and away the worst I've ever had, and the only reason I tried it in the first place was because I accidentally ordered from this place and not another restaurant in the immediate area, which is the realest joint in the block.
