Although this pizzeria is out in North town, the food should be the number one reason to trek here from other parts of the Valley. It's a small pizzeria tucked into a small strip mall next to an auto shop.\n\nOnce you step inside you are in a world of pizza pies of olden days. As you approach the counter you are greeted by men working recklessly at their craft. If you arrive when they are busy, you will see the older men yelling at the younger ones, \"Don't forget that cannoli!\" \"We've got more coming in!\", and they all run about behind the counter in plain view. Definitely \"old school\". \n\nI placed an order for take out on their online ordering system (YES! I LOVE IT!). And when I arrived my pizza was nearly done. Also of note - the system will keep you updated via text message on the progress of your order. \n\nOrdered: One Large pizza (serves 3 - 4), with half ham, and half ham + hot peppers. An order of Garlic Rosemary Bread Knots, and One Cannoli. \n\nWhile I waited for my pizza I got a fountain drink, not long after the young man at the counter helped me out to my car and placed my order into my backseat for me.\n\nWhen the pizza arrived at my home it was beautiful! Perfectly cooked with a thin, crispy, and somewhat chewy crust. Really, it was just that perfection of pizza crust style. Tomato sauce and cheese melded in food harmony. The ham placed on top of the pie was plentiful, and the hot peppers (red and yellow) were fresh and gave my part of the pizza that extra kick I was looking for. \n\nRosemary Garlic Bread Knots were unfathomably good for just being bread and some spices. The rosemary is the simple star here - changing regular old knots into a savory, aromatic eating experience.\n\nLast - I split the Canoli in half to share with my husband (what a nice wife I am!), and it had a flaky exterior and a creamy inside. Absolutely delicious! I wish only I had gotten two instead of the one. Well, now I know for next time!
