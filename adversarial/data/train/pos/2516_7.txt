So this place is currently sharing a kitchen with the King of Spice restaurant (look for their sign when trying to find the place). I didn't understand the hype before today because my friend woke me up on a Saturday morning (grrr) to tell me that we should be ready to go once she got the notification. Again, I didn't understand the exclusivity but I figured \"oh, what the hell\" and gathered my life to get out the bed! Let me tell you... I'm not even mad! Lol \n\nThe hour of operations varies and they also operate on different days of the week because the kitchen space is shared. For the most up to date information, refer to their IG page (@seafoodconnectioncharlotte). The IG will also provide an update on what items aren't available from their menu for that particular day. \n\nIF THE LINE IS LONG...STAY THERE! Seriously, it moves faster than any place I've been where the food is made to order! I will not disclose how long we waited because it varies day to day and I don't want to discourage anyone's tummy (but prepare to be patient for at least 1.5 hours). Also, they operate as CASH ONLY (no exceptions). If you forget cash then there is an ATM available... but save yourself the headache and just bring cash before you arrive. Also, the prices aren't budget friendly so check out the menu before you offer to pick up plates for others! BUT IT'S WORTH IT (my pregnant friend gave it the motherly stamp of approval since she still had food left over). \n\nThe customer service is wonderful and even though the people behind you will want you to rush, the cashier will be friendly and helpful (in no way am I condoning that you take your sweet time though, lol). \n\nAll in all.... I will be back there!! Maybe sooner than later!
