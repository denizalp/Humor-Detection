I hope management reads this review. The cakes are sweet but the staff is sour. And that kept me away for a while, but I can't lie anymore, I miss it. I have been there so many times before and each time the customer service is a let down but whom am I lying? I can't keep away. I would like to boycott, but I keep coming back. What the heck, just one star off, but please just keep on making the cakes. I love them!
