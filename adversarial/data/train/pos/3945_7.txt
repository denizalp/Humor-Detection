Glorified motel.\nSmelly, run down, creepy, dirty and noisy motel with paper thin walls. We were there for a total of 20 minutes while we booked a seperate hotel to get out of there asap. I'm just totally surprised that this place has business. I've been to cleaner strip clubs than this place. The air was thick with cheap perfume that automatically made my sinuses upset. The walk towards towards the room felt unsafe, the curtains were burned off half way, the non smoking room smelled of cigarettes and feces.\n\nTake a look for yourself. These are the non (heavily) edited photographs\n\nFor the price, there are much better sanitary options on the strip.
