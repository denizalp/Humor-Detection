Needs implosion.  \n\nSeriously, the MGM is past its prime and offers no \"signature attraction\".  The \"Crazy Horse\" Revue is a waste of money, and if you have epilepsy, the light changes could send you into a seizure!  \n\nThe Lion Habitat is more saddening than interesting.  The lions appear sedated--but then, so do most of the people looking at them.  \n\nThe rooms have seen better days, and if you have a Corner Suite (located at the ends of the halls), the walk from the elevator to the Suite is 10-12 minutes!  That's a long walk if you're hammered!  \n\nOn the weekends, a younger crowd descends upon MGM like locusts on farm land.  Eating and drinking everything in their path, they leave nothing behind but a path of destruction.  i'm going back to Caesar's or Bellagio--heck, I'll even go back to Motel 6!
