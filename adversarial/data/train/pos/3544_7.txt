* * * Releasing my inner-GEEK with pride! * * *  \nLove, LUV, LOVE the concept of combining new & old school arcade games with a bar + lounge + dance floor... splashed together in the best location... downtown LV! \n\nDO come here if u were a video game geek kid or still are a video game geek!  Enjoy a video gamer's atmosphere in a 21 & up environment... Yeehaw!\nDON'T expect to find the best selection of games here... it's more of a bar\/club atmosphere than a video game lounge.  The better game selection is available for the reserved game booths.  I inquired about booking a booth... quoted cost ~$20 a head, depending on the liquor bottle of choice.\n\nDO arrive early (before 10pm) on the weekends to bypass the $5 door fee...\nDON'T forget to get a hand stamp so u don't have to pay if u re-enter after 10pm. \n\nDO partake in the FREE game play along the bar, it's FREE only if u drink at the bar.\nDO take advantage of the two FREE arcade games that are along the wall towards the entrance.  \nDON'T ask me which game it is.  It's some 2-player fighting game that works without u having to put money in it... hence,  f r e e ?!\n\nDO expect a bit of rude service from the employees...\nDON'T expect great service.  They aren't as nice as they used to be when Insert Coins first opened.\n\nDO take a break from the video gaming to let loose on the dance floor... it's small and cozy... and fun for people watching!  Y^_^Y\nDO try to enjoy yourself here... bar\/lounge, games, music, dim-lighting, wall artwork... the atmosphere here is GREAT!  \nDON'T expect a \"clean\" environment... Yes, it can get smokey... expect it... this is Vegas. \n\nSERVICE: *** [Hit or Miss.  Some employees are nice, some are a bit pretentious.]\nAMBIANCE: **** [Crowded on the weekends, can get smokey at times, dim lighting, decent sized dance floor w\/ live DJ!]\nPRICE:  $$  [FREE game usage at the bar w\/ drink purchase, two arcade games by the door are FREE--all others are $0.50 per game, $5 door charge on weekends after 10pm.] \nOVERALL:  **** [4-stars. LOVE the concept of video games + bar + dance lounge]\n\nNevertheless, I felt like a kid again... now just with a different choice of beverage!\nNuff said.
