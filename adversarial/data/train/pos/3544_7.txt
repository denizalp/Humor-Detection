So, someone picked up and asked if I could be placed on a brief hold, I said \"sure\".........................................................\nAnd after patiently waiting 9 minutes (actually 9:47 to be exact), the phone was picked up and someone proceeded to hang up on me. \n\nI called back....\n\"Can I place you on a brief hold?\"\nUmmm.... \"No\"\nI explained the situation and all I got was, \"We're really busy, so I'm placing you on hold.\"\n\nARE YOU KIDDING?  You call this customer service???
