Have you ever been peed on by a Siberian tiger? I have, but let's get to that in a minute.\n\nFirst things first: tickets are $18 per person, but if you happen to know someone that buys Hickman eggs (which I do) you can get a coupon off of the back for a buy one get one free deal.  Not bad at all.\n\nThis is the best zoo I've ever been to. Hands down. It was amazing. You are able to get very close to the animals, which is cool and a little scary.\n\nBack to the pee incident- I was about a foot away from the Siberian tiger and the only thing separating me from him was a fence.  He was pacing back and forth and everyone was remarking on how cool it was to see him up close until....wait for it...\nhe sprayed a few people, myself included with urine or his man tiger scent. Whatever you might call it, it was sick and pretty funny all at the same time. \n\nAfter dousing myself with water, we moved on to the rest of the zoo.  My boyfriend and I fed giraffes and monkeys, rode on the sky ride, took a train ride through a little portion of the zoo, saw 2 two-month old baby tigers and fed goats and llamas in the petting zoo.  \n\nThey have a ton of really cool, exotic animals here that you get to see up and close and personal- something that doesn't happen at most other zoos.  I didn't try any of the food at the snack bars or cafes, but they have a few, so you definitely have the option of having lunch or an early dinner there.\n\nThe zoo is 55 acres I believe and is open from 9am to 5pm.  It's the coolest thing ever, so check it out.
