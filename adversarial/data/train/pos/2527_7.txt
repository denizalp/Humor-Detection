Oh Chipotle. You give me a stomach ache half the time I eat your burrito bol, yet I can't stop going. Thank you for being open late and for being so close to my apartment. You were my only dinner option at 10pm on moving-in day and you get an extra star just for that. You'll be seeing a lot more of me - even though you have the most uncomfortable seating of any Chipotle I have been inside.
