Having grown up in Texas, one of the things I miss most is breakfast tacos. But with Tacos Huevos around, I don't need to! Eggs in the name means breakfast is available all day- my pick is the scrambled egg tacos with potatoes and bacon or sausage, but whatever you get, add melted cheese on top and a side of their green ajo sauce (creamy avocado). The tortillas are freshly made for that extra touch of awesome. It's a great way to start my day! Bonus points for having vegan and vegetarian options.\n\nThat said, staff are friendly but ordering system is disorganized- it's a cafeteria style made-to-order line but it's unclear who takes the order, makes the order, and rings it up, as staff are constantly moving between roles leading to forgotten items and payment delays.
