Frankly, I love everything about this place. When I'm at the Whining Pig, it seems like I'm somewhere besides Phoenix. Not to knock my own city, but there is something to be said for being in a truly urban environment where ducking into a bar means finding a seat and mingling by shear force of enclosed spaces. Tonight I watched a girl challenge anyone on the other side of the bar to a game of connect 4. It was cool, everyone considered playing and somebody accepted her challenge. Fun. Fun. Fun. \n\nYou have to give the owner, who you will see behind the bar at all times, lots of credit for appreciating and incorporating simplicity. Great beer. Great wine. Hungry? They will get their highly trained kitchen staff (owner's dad) putting together simple, tasty, filling and inexpensive dishes like a ham and cheese sandwich for I think $2.50 or better yet, try the plate filled with cheese, sausage, apple, honey, bread and crackers for under $10.\n\nMaybe my favorite touch is the soap dispenser in the bathroom. Hilarious. Straight out of a country club bathroom with the sunscreen, etc. \n\nAll told, a welcome addition to a corner that has many bars, but lacked a whining pig.
