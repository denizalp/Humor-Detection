Azuza is one of my favorite hookah lounges. It's clean and in the UNLV\/ off the strip area on Paradise. I used to come here all the time when I was in college.\n\nThe food here is freaking awesome! They have a small selection but everything is made to order and is fresh. Their hookahs are clean which is a plus because most hookah lounges have nasty hoses. They give you the hookah tips here, and the water is 100% clear inside the bowl. Their hookah flavor menu is freaking awesome as well. Theres about 100's of combinations of flavors so you can be your own mixologist.\n\nThe drinks here are really good too. Cheap and strong lol. I ask for my signature jack & coke and they always put like 2-3 shots in my drink! Thanks guys ;)\n\nThe service is a hit or miss. Sometimes the hookah girls get too into flirting with the customers that they forget to check on other tables but its fine because I'm a pretty patient person. Clean, upscale hookah lounge with VIP areas, cheap drinks, and good hookah. B+ 4\/5 !
