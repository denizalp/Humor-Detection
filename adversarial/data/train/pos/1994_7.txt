A dinner at clever koi is an unforgettable experience, not to be missed. It's a nice looking restaurant, the food is fantastic, and you'll be thinking about it long after the meal is over. We started with the dumpling which was unique and curiously flavored. \n\nMy main course, The seafood hot pot, was tender, moist pieces of calamary steak, smothered in a delicious broth with tomato, honey, cardamom and what I'm assuming was a pound of laxatives. I haven't stopped shitting since 9:30PM of last night.\n\nNasty white chick in dreads working at the kitchen seemed to shed her locks as she proceeds to cook poorly seasoned dishes that tore through my anal cavity with the awesome fury of the Horsemen of the apocalypse. Well done I say. By the way I never received one single smile from the serving staff. But, who needs smiles if they're serving foods of this caliber. \n\nSomeone saw that we did not touch our food, after some initial examination. The manager sent us his compliments, dessert of deep-fried bread balls, to be dipped in delectable exotic caramel sauce, which incinerated everything in my intestines. My morning was an unforgettable thrill ride. Mostly from the comfort of my bathroom. Semi-private. I have roommates. \n\nThe exotic flavors and aromas of Asia came flooding back to me as I literally peed out of my butt.\n\nIf you are portly or tall, or simply a gentleman of indiscriminate palate, or simply someone who suffer from chronic incontinent, this is the place. Simply start your meal with anything on the menu...you're either taste your food yet again upon its exit from your mouth hole, or your anus shall afford the pleasure once the curious spices of Clever Koi lands in the lower intestines.
