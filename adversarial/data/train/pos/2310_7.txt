It really hit us how much pride they took in their store's appearance. The garage was clean and the waiting area had nice chairs, coffee, and everything was meticulously displayed and set up. The service we received was even better. Robert was extremely friendly and had us laughing half of the time. \n\nWe also think its important to mention that the reason we found this store was that nobody else had the tire we needed in stock. In fact, even this store didn't have it in stock, but Robert was the only one who reacted with that information by telling us he could have it in the next day. We agreed, and the next day Robert called us to let us know it arrived and he could have the tire on our car in 10 minutes. \n\nOverall, the experience was tremendous!
