What a great place to get deals! I was on my first visit to Metro Center Mall. It feels a little like a clearance warehouse. It doesn't quite have the more organized feel of a regular Dillard's, but the sale prices were fabulous.\n\nThe already discounted prices were 50% more in the Junior's section. I have been keeping an eye out for Prom gowns. The dress that my daughter picked out was originally $280. Our final ticket was $53. The gown was not pristine: a few missing beads and loose thread that I will be able to fix with needle and thread.\n\nThe cashier was super nice and made sure that the dress was beautifully bagged.\n\nTip: All sales are final.
