Rocking chairs don't mean much to the road weary traveler who has already been on the road, either on a plane or stuck in an airport for well over 12 hours; especially when said traveler realizes she is stuck in Charlotte overnight, and not in Nashville, where she was headed and has a reservation at a nice comfy hotel and dinner reservations somewhere yummy.  Add to this the fact that the place is a damned ghost town late at night and if you're really super lucky you just might get to wander the length of three entire concourses looking for someone who can help you, rushing with your heavy ass computer bag, because maybe, just MAYBE there is another flight?!  But there isn't, and the empty empty airport mocks you for being so foolishly optimistic.  And then you can go and stay at the Ramada for $59.  Only if you're lucky though.\nBetter signage would be nice Charlotte-Douglas, and white rockers don't quite make up for it.  Especially since you're a US Airways hub and I needed to find some US Airways help, which my ticket printout helpfully mentions I can find in any concourse, which is an absolute lie.\nWhite rockers and wi-fi are nice, but not that nice.
