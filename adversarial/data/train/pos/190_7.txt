Surrender = Encore Beach Club!!!\n\nI came here earlier in the day for EBC and couldn't put two and two together so my girls and I arrived dressed to the 9's expecting a club atmosphere like XS. Don't make the same mistakes we did!! It's much more casual as you can still wear your bathing suit into the pool!\n\nThe water by the pool gets very wet and slick (more so than other pools) so be careful!!\n\nThere is also a water fountain available, by the far end of the little casino\/bar area. Find a plastic cup and keep hydrated!
