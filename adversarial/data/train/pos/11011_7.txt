RUN....this place is a dump.  Wish I could rate a minus 100.  In town for a funeral.  Booked for 2 nights... wish I could have found another place to stay. cancelled the 2nd night within an hour of checking in, and that was before the 2 am chaos began.   Smelly carpet,  a\/c sounded like a running garbage disposal with a spoon stuck in it. Door was broken and all of this was the second room they put us in.  People obviously on drugs hanging out in the parking lot.  People yelling obscenities at 2 am, people throwing shoes off the second floor, loud obnoxious music coming from a vehicle at 4 am till 4:30 am. No phone in the room,  no trash can in the room.  Very scary and unsafe feeling.
