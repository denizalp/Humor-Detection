Can I say something??\n\nI guess I can..\n\n1. Stop checking out young girls when they come. Im here to EAT.. it's very uncomfortable to eat when every second some old Chinese dudes are giggling and looking at me!!!!!!!!! SERIOUSLY. We ate and left RIGHT AWAY.\n\n2. The waiter's attitude is just HORRIBLE..... I didn't even get the menu until I ASKED FOR IT... after been sitting their for 5minutes\n\n3. Waiter gets the orders WRONG\n\nI guess the food is OK, its like sushi on bloor... I think they are the same chain, yeah??? The sashimi was a LITTLE fresher than Sushi on bloor... but overall experiences is just as HORRIBLE as sushi on bloor.\n\nnever go back there again.\n\nIf I have choice, this place gets either 0 star or even NEGATIVE ratings.\n\ncheers,\n\nY
