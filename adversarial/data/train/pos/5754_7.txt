1) Why was yesterday my first time at this place?  I LIVED at College and Grace and still never knew about it...though, that was before our yelp days.\n\n2) Why have none of my friends ever said to me \"You know Mel, you would really enjoy going to Eat My Martini.\"\n\n3) Why did I bother pre-drinking before going to a place that serves inexpensive well-made martinis?\n\nThis is a great place and I'll be back for more...I want them to name a martini after me - The Mel Martini (nice ring to it eh?).\n\nOne star taken away for how they name the martinis.  With over 100 types, it would be beneficial if the names reflect the flavour of the martini.   You'll need to read the ingredients to get an idea of what you're ordering - after a couple of drinks, that may be difficult.
