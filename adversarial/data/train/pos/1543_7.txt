I was craving some local food so when we were in town and I knew I had to stop in. I ordered take out because I didn't want to wait in the long line and we had to get back to the hotel. Didn't take long for the food to be ready and they were super nice and friendly on the oboe and at the counter. They opened up each package so you can make sure that the order was right. All the utinsils were in the bag which is a plus. My daughter for the strawberry pancake. The strawberry and whip cream on the side to make sure the pancakes stayed firm. It tastes like the sauce was homemade. I got the adobo fried rice. Enough to feed two people. \n\nIf you're craving local food this is the place to go. Be prepared for long waits depending on the time you go. The wait is worth it. You can always order takeout if you want to avoid the lines.
