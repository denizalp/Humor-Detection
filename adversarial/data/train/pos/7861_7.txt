Many, many thanks to this CVS which is typical of most CVSes except this one saves hungover lives on the strip. If you forgot toiletries or had them confiscated by TSA no worries! This CVS has everything you bought prior to your trip and wasted at LaGuardia. It also sells cold water, Tylenol and chips which can and has saved many lives.\n\nA wonderful cashier named Ms Sharon was out cashier. She had a beautiful energy that gave me life. I don't usually give CVS 5 stars but the customer service here by Ms Sharon warranted it.
