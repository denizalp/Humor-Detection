I feel compelled to write a review for this place! Went here for breakfast on a saturday morning, there weren't many people.\n\nThe food is amazing, and the price is really cheap ( a small steak for 5.99, really?) and it actually is very tasty.\n\nThe coffee is a little weak, but I have not had a stronger coffee in any other breakfast place either(Cora, Eggs breakfast etc)\n\nThe pancakes a re pretty good too. If you don't mind having meat in the morning, they have something with Eggs + Steak + potatoes + bread, for under $10, and its very filling and tasty.
