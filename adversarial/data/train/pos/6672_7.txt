(Lyrics - The Beatles - Hey Jude)\n\nHey Joe, don't make it bad\nTake a salad and make it better\nOrganic to make it healthy for my heart\nThen you can start to make my burger\n\nHey Joe, don't be afraid\nI was made to go out and Yelp you\nThe minute you let try your onion rings\nThen I begin to feel a lot better\n\nAnd anytime I feel hungry pains, hey Joe's Farm Grill\nPlease carry some fries and bacon burgers\nFor well you know that it's Bo Bites who eats and sings\nBy making your world a little tastier\nNah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah\n\n\nIt's Joe's from Diners, Drive-Ins & Dives!\n\nYes, this sweet spot has been around for some times and always a pleasure to visit.  Service here is always on spot and just having the ability to walk around the yard is fun.  The Coffee Shop next doors bakes up a storm and the farmers market is always cool to explore.  \n\nI came to Joe's after a run with a friend so we were pretty hungry!  I went for the Fontina Burger with Onion Rings, while she ordered the Ahi Sandwich with Beets.  My burger was cooked to perfection while the peppers and fontina cheese gave it a lovely sweet pop.  I would say they have the softest bun around and it just literally melts in your mouth.  The Onion rings were fresh and crunchy with every bite.  My friends Ahi Sandwich had the same bun, but within was a large slab of tuna with some slaw.  Overall, a crunchiness of the slaw gave it some texture while the wasabi mayo provided some heat.  The tuna itself was cooked lightly seared so you had somewhat of a sashimi taste to it.  \n\nIn the end, Joe's Farm Grill is always a recommendation whenever someone ask me about a great place to eat.  The experience itself is always great because of the atmosphere it has and the food is always consistent! - Enjoy!
