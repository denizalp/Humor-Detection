This is one of my favorite Korean restaurants in Champaign! I always come here with friends and we really enjoy the food. The owners are super friendly and you can get free refills on rice. The only downside about coming here is that you leave smelling like food, so this isn't exactly the place to wear your Sunday's best, lol. \n\nDishes I've had and loved:\n-galbi (short ribs)\n-bibimbap\n-bulgogi\n-soon du bu with beef\n-chicken stir fry (new fav: i get it in a spicy sauce and it comes with veggies and rice cake)
