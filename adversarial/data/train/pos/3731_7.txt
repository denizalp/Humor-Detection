delicious pizza place owned by a young couple (i think) with a knack for flavor pairing and ingredient selection. the crust does not let a pizza aficionado down: It's doughy inside and crispy outside, not burnt but slightly blackened by the handbuilt woodfired oven in the kitchen. they have a predictably varied beer selection, though nothing on tap (i don't think) and they had gotten rid of their wine menu (or at least they didn't have wine at the end of March when I was there). i felt sad when i went twice and each time i was one of only two customers. here's hoping pittsburgh residents and visitors will give this place the love it deserves.
