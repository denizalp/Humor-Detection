Chaotic......I mean, really bad.  The place carries with it, a very PROUD name but their staff and food has a lot to be desired.  I got suckered in by the reputation of the name.  There were mass people everywhere with no organization.  I could have sworn every waiter\/waitress was a host with no clear organization to whom was really running the place.  Once seated, our orders taken took a long time and our food took just as long making back to our table.  \n\nThe food:.....coming from the San Gabriel Valley in California, I would say I'm a good judge of late night foods....but this placed SUCKED!  I mean, we are just talking about Chow Fun and Wonton Mein yaw'l !!!!!!\n\nLong story short....if you are looking for good eats off the strip and you happen to think, HEY....lets head up to Vegas Chinatown, you just might want to go to Tea Station.....get eats a drinks there.....drive by this place when you are done, and spit some boba at this place =P
