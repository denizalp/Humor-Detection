OH MY GOD.  This place was terrible.\n\nI came in to an empty location with my girlfriend thinking, this place we haven't tried yet, let's give it a shot on a Sunday afternoon (both of us hungry).  \n\nWhat a mistake.  \n\nThere was one couple ahead of us, and they ordered two wraps.  Once they paid, and were issued their change, the customer asked why he was shorted five dollars.  The cashier, smiled and gave a quizzical look of either smug capture or awkward embarrassment, and said, oh you're right, I will give it back to you once I take this next order to open the till.\n\nI took note, but thought it an honest error.\n\nWe ordered a noodle dish with beef & shrimp which came to 9.75, and order of dumplings (over priced) at 6.09, a cup of miso soup 2.49, and one can of diet coke, which I showed the cashier at time of purchase.  She nodded and said okay.  My girlfriend had my wallet and paid the bill with me not really paying attention to the price.  \n\nThe till popped open and the first couple got their correct change back.\n\nWe sat down waiting for our order to be completed, and once we got our order, it as a train wreck.  But I'll get to that in a second.  \n\nI asked my gf what she ended up paying for the order, she said $25 dollars or so.  WHAT?!?  We had one meal shared and it didn't seem right, I asked her for the receipt which she did not have.  I went up to the counter and saw a stack of receipts on the counter by the till, and reached for ours, since we were last it was easy to find.  \n\nThe cashier had charged us for \"extra noodles\" .99, \"extra rice noodles\".50 on our DUMPLINGS?!, and 4.56 for TWO bottles of FUZE drink.  Note, bottles are more than cans, and we had one can, and it definitely was not a Fuze drink.  Nod of confirmation from her my ass....  \n\nI confronted her about my extra charges, and she claimed it an accident.  Interesting.  I asked for my refund, she said she cannot give me a refund, she has to call the manager.  What?!  This was her theft er, mistake, and now I can't get my money back?  I complained further, stating I will make a big stink, and she gave me a partial refund.  Wait a minute, the refund was not the complete amount for my order.  WTF?!  I caught her again!!! She finally fixed it properly when she saw the look of death come from me.  \n\nI went and sat down 15 minutes later of battling for my money back only to find that my gf didn't eat much of the food.  Noodles untouched, dumplings, one eaten of the six and one bitten.  I asked her what was wrong with it, and then I took a bite. \n\nI literally spit the bite onto the plate and deemed this product\/dish inedible.  Refund to ensue on my mind.  \n\nYet another battle.  She didn't want to refund and said this was not her fault.  I said I don't care, it's TERRIBLE, and I'm returning the plate of product.  \n\nShe gave me $5 from the till and asked if that was enough.  Wow.  The stereotype of the bargaining asian did not need to stick here.  NO.  I want my $6 back and you keep the change.  \n\nI asked for the manager's number which lead to a dead end, and probably a fake name.  Peter 403 542 5426.\n\nI fearlessly gave her my business card and said, someone from Teriyaki will hear from me.  \n\nI also should mention that I not only took photos, but recorded the ENTIRE conversation with the cashier \"Christine\" that was as shady as I've ever seen.  I plan on following up with head office.  \n\nUnacceptable.\n\nWe walked out of the location and threw our noodles into the garbage.  \n\nLet's nutshell today's experience:\n- witnessed short changing of a customer in front of us\n- over charged for items on our order\n- refusal to refund\n- bad product\n- unapologetic behaviour\n- refusal to refund\n- veiled threats from manager or owner who \"doesn't care\" about my experience (according to cashier\/employee)\n- several flies circulating the preparation are (didn't mention how unsettling that was)\n\n\n****UPDATE*****\n\nJust checked the website.  THIS LOCATION CHARGES .50 MORE PER ITEM THAN LISTED ON WEBSITE.  MEANING THEY ARE STEALING FROM CUSTOMERS.\n\nwow.  \n\nContacted head office - check\nContacted BBB - soon\nContacted on site manager (assuming the cashier is not the owner as I suspect) - soon\nSatisfaction - trying.
