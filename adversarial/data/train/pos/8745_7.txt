Corkbuzz certainly lived up to my expectations!!!  The restaurant has a small super chic vibe, The ambiance was perfect for a date night. The wine pairings we're spot on and we even got to meet Laura the owner ( who couldn't have been more wonderful) I had the octopus appetizer, which was unbelievable. And the clam spaghetti, I have no words. For dessert we had the homemade chocolate chip cookie sandwich and it was as good as it sounds! It was delicious and the best meal I have had in Charlotte by far! Can't wait to return
