I've been here three times, in 2004, 2007 and last week. The first two times were great, very nice stylists and I was happy with my cut. Last week was awful- the stylist (Simon) was brusque, rushed and condescending. He pulled out one of my earrings while brushing my hair and was pretty unconcerned. He dismissed\/critiqued my concern that he was cutting my hair too short. Basically, just an unpleasant fellow\/experience, and I paid $60 for the pleasure. Never again! I'm going back to Nicole in St-Laurent- sweet, creative and cuts for $10-20.
