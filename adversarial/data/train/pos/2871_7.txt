Kabab Je is pretty amazing, starting with their staff, which is a great thing when you're talking about us southerners who often have little clue about Persian food. On the downside, it can be a bit overwhelming, and move from the \"happy to help you\" to the \"why not sit down because you're here so much\" variety, but they are so stinking nice, it's really not a bad thing - just that it can interrupt conversations, if you mind that sort of thing.\n\nWhen it comes to the food, many things are just this side of amazing. The hummus, as has been mentioned, is some of the best in Charlotte, but do yourself a favor, and order the moutabal (eggplant) instead - it's that good. There isn't any harm in trying the hummus, of course, but the moutabal is awesome.\n\nAlmost oddly, there is no shortage of Persian food in Charlotte, this goes more to the quick-serve variety, which means that the food comes out quickly, as opposed to some other places that can take a while. That's a good thing, as you can pop in for a quick dinner, or even food to go, and they have plenty of things pre-prepared in their deli cases so you can take it home to boot. Nice.
