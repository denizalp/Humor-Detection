Get the app before you go! You'll get $7 food credit after spending $99! \n\nHere's how it works- order at the counter and be sure to say if you want your sandwich warm or cold. The default is warm so be sure you specify. Use the app at the counter and then receive a playing card for your order. If you are lucky like me, you'll have the lucky card and get a grab-bag gift. I won a water bottle! When you're order is ready, they will call out your card and deliver to your table. I ordered two halves: a green turkey & a smokey southwest chicken. Boyfriend and I split each half and we both preferred the green turkey which includes:\nOven Roasted Turkey, Bacon, Cream Cheese, Guacamole, Onions, Sprouts, Tomatoes, Salsa. I always order without tomato but if you like them, they would pair so well with the ingredients. \n\nThe half subs are $5.50 and the whole subs are $8.50. Obviously a much better deal getting a whole but we aren't big eaters and wanted to start knowing the menu. My next visit will include another green turkey and something new. \n\nWorth noting: they have vegetarian, vegan and gluten-free options. They also cater and have a birthday club. Yeap, I'm a fan!
