My favourite park of all time, bringing back a ton of memories. \n\nI was here when this park was not even built, in fact it was a piece of land, all dug up, with dirt everywhere. Slowly, they dug a huge hole for water, placed in a bridge, planted trees, filled it in with grass. Sidewalks began getting paved and benches were put in.Next came the three soccer fields with large nets, and now tennis courts, a second park, basketball courts, traffic lights, etc.\n\nBerczy Park is a neighbourhood gem, giving many people the motivation to walk around this area. I would highly watch out for geese droppings near the lake area (I used to visit that area a lot, until all the geese claimed that spot as their habitat - the remediation process for this is something we need to work on!
