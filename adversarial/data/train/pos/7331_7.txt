Spent my Thursday night at this Brazillian Steakhouse. Came into this dine in with reasonably high expectations considering the price. Its about 60$ with tip and is an all you can eat experience. They have a walk up buffet with appetizers like soup, meatballs, salad etc. The walk up buffet was quite underwhelming, i ended up regretting adding most of the items i put on my plate. \n\nThe concept of the all you can eat was explained rather smoothly by our server. Basically they bring out meat to the service area and offer you slabs of meat. You are given a coaster like object with two sides, one being red and one being green. We were given instructions to flip it to the red side when not wanting meat and to the green when hungry. The meat started coming out shortly after we arrived and was being pumped out at a good pace. Some meat was good some meat was bad but we were getting a nice variety and fast service. We had a good amount of meat and flipped our coaster to the red side for a short break. Then when we decided to start our second round of chowing, thats when things started to go down hill. The service seemed to have slowed down considerably and we were getting lots of repeats of meats when we were really only hoping to get the certain meats we enjoyed. The dessert was unincluded in the all you can eat cost which was kinda dissapointing. \n\nTo sum up the service was average and the food did not meet my divine expectations. I dont really recommend it considering all the different options in the plaza and its price tag. Some of the meat is quite pleasant but its wildly inconsistent. \n\nIf the business owners are reading... I highly recommend after the first round of service giving your guests a menu and the option of their favorite meats. This would make the dining experience much more pleasant for your high paying customers.
