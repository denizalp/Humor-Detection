Here's why Energy gets four stars:\n* It's one of only a handful of Dance radio stations left in the U.S.  Phoenix bests LA, Chicago, Dallas and New York on this front.  Rawr!!  They lost their dance stations years ago.\n* The broadcast area goes clear up to Sedona and Flagstaff on 106 point something if you ever drive up north, you will find Energy to be the only half-decent station up that way.\n\nI rediscovered Energy on a drive to Flagstaff a few weeks ago, and have been hooked on the station since then. \n\nIt's weird to me, because I like to hate those \"types*\" who listen to Energy and nothing else and they do tend to play a lot of the same house and club anthems from way-back-when to now - but that's the beauty of it too. \n\n* I think I just offended half of my friends.  I hope they are not reading.
