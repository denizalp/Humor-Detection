Very nice room hotel is awesome I'm giving a one star review only because me and my girlfriend went to buy condoms and they charge $14 for condoms come on the one thing that they should not make money on is promoting safe sex!!!!! I really hope that this changes things if not Las Vegas is a joke!!!!\n\n\nOk so after this happened I went out to get something to eat one morning had my room cleaned when I was gone and came back to my room my extra bathroom smelled like fish so I called down to house keeping to clean my bathroom they only sprayed something to make it smell better so I requested a manager and for someone to clean it this time because the smell wasn't going away they came to my room cleaned it and the manager said the smell was something wrong with the toilet and someone would come to my room to fix it, no one came to my room to look at it or fix it and the smell magically went away not sure if the original person that came to my room to clean my room done something in my bathroom but I'm pretty sure something went down in that bathroom when I was gone I will never come back to any of the mgm property's so nasty!!!!
