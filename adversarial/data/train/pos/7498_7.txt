I was on the hunt for a new work bag so I started calling  different local stores to inquire about the handbags they had in their inventory.  Disappointed by the selection in my area I called, randomly, 5 hours away to one of the Céline boutiques in Las Vegas.  \n\nNicole was great!  She offered to text me pictures of the bags in stock.  She sent me multiple styles and colors and was always quick to respond when I had questions.  It took me a couple of days to decide on THE one.  All through the selection process I never felt pressured or rushed.  I had such a great experience shopping with Céline even before I ever set foot in their store.  I was amazed at how quickly my purchase arrived.  I ordered the handbag on a Tuesday and was carrying it on my arm by Thursday.\n\nOn a recent trip to Vegas I made it a point to visit the Céline store at Crystals.  All of the staff was very friendly and helpful as I tried on their jewelry.  Highly recommended!
