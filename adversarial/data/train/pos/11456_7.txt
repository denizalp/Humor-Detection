You know a place is fabulous when:\n\nYour traditional I-don't-prefer-any-non-Asian-food (nor like any-cheese for that matter) father sits down to lunch, orders the Caesar's Chicken SALAD (which arrives complete w\/ a generous sprinkling of parmesan cheese), and proceeds to rave about how it's THE best salad he's ever had.  Over and over again.  In between bites.\n\nOh and my salmon dish was pretty good too.
