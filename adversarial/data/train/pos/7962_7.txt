We arrived at Saigon Pho for dinner at 7:00pm on a Sunday evening, which was an hour before closing time.  We were promptly seated and our waitress took our order right away.  Our order consisted of string beans, egg rolls, and beef pho.  The string beans had good texture and flavor, the egg rolls were tasty, and the pho was really delicious with well-cooked firm noodles and medium rare beef.  Overall food rating - 4.5\/5.\n\nThe service was efficient and mostly friendly, but we did feel some pressure to rush our meal due to the proximity to closing time.  The pressure from staff was mostly directed at folks who had arrived after we did, but our dinner was also impacted by it.  I did feel the pressure was unwarranted in any case.  Overall service rating - 2.5\/5.\n\nIt appeared to me that the soup bowls had gotten smaller from the last time I was here.  Saigon is still a good value with reasonable prices, good food, and mostly reliable service, but next time I will avoid evening hours altogether due to the bad vibe at this time.  Overall rating 3.5\/5.
