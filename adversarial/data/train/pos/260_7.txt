To say this was a bad restaurant, would be an insult to all bad restaurants. The Olive Garden was one level below this...perhaps in a category called horrible.\n\nI am not a big fan of chain restaurants but I know there are always some exceptions, but it was not the case here.  I went here because it was close and still open and I was hungry.   It says a lot when a restaurant's biggest feature is that they give you unlimited salad and breadsticks.  \n\nIf you want anything resembling Italian food, OG probably shouldn't be your first choice.  I chose Eggplant Parmesean, a dish that is so basic and is usually my barometer for decent Italian food.  OG failed miserably.  Soggy, greasy eggplant and tomato sauce with a microwaved cheese on top.  I ate a small portion of it and decided to eat more of my unlimited salad and breadsticks.  Maybe this is what happens when food is mass produced.  The quality is just not there.   I will say that the glass of peach iced tea I had with my meal was delicious.\n\nA special note should be made about our server.  I can't say that she did anything particularly wrong in taking care of us...she never smiled - not even once - the entire time she was helping us.  I will give her the benefit of the doubt because everyone has an off day, but it just contributed to the ambiance.\n\nI would say that if you're looking for good or even just decent Italian food, maybe you'd want to visit a smaller, mom & pop kind of place that actually puts some care into what they are doing.  That's what I'll do next time.  I should have known better.
