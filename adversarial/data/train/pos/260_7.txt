Ah the venetian... where you can travel the famous venice canals by canoe.\n\nI mean gondolas.\n\nThe shops and food around the lobby is great, but navigating around the rooms is like going through a labyrinth. I stayed here for 2 days, and trying to find my room was like trying to find Amelia Earhart's aircraft!  \n\nAll in all, it was an enjoyable stay, but much prefer the Cosmo over this place!
