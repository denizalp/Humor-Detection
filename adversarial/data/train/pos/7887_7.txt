This is my third Vegas trip in a row visiting Comme Ca.  It's pretty much become one of my default stops in Vegas that I simply just can't avoid and it's really hard for me to resist coming here for lunch.\n\nMy last two visits simply just had me order their famous Duck Confit Cinnamon Roll and call it a day.  Well, that didn't stop here with this visit.  But unlike those two visits before, I came with a bigger appetite and I ordered the their Oxtail Eggs Benedict as my main entree.\n\nDuck Confit Cinnamon Roll with Pork Belly --  http:\/\/bit.ly\/1c1GQSF\nw\/ smoked bacon frosting, raspberry compote\nThis is one of those dishes that seem to get better every time I have it, even for the third time.  Like before, it's really hard to explain in words how amazing this thing is.  Sweetness from the cinnamon roll and raspberries, savory duck confit inside, and smokey flavor of the pork belly.  Oh, and there's Bacon Frosting too!  It's really not fair that I have to fly to another state to have this.  A must order every time!!  \n\nOxtail Eggs Benedict  --  http:\/\/bit.ly\/190ewQc\nw\/ warm goug√®res, spinach, two poached eggs, truffle hollandaise\nAre you kidding me?  This is definitely a great savory contrast to the sweetness of Duck Confit Cinnamon Roll.  There's a lot going on with this Eggs Benedict because of the braised oxtail and the truffle hollandaise.  It's oozing with flavor and has a lot of substance.  This is food porn at its finest.  One of the best Eggs Benedicts I've ever had!!\n\nI can't help but give high praise for their lunch which is only available Friday through Sunday.  There are plenty of other things to try like their Comme Ca Burger, Fried Chicken Sandwich, and Red Velvet Bacon Waffles. Someday, I'll be back to try their dinner.  I probably don't need to, because I would most likely end up going back for lunch anyways and I'm perfectly fine with that.
