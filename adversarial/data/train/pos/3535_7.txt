Wow is all I can say. I am a recent convert to Phoenix Community Acupuncture after going to a \"traditional acupuncture\" studio became cost prohibitive. I found out about the sliding fee schedule of $15-$35 a session and thought I would give it a try. As others have noted this is a community clinic so there are 12 recliners set up in a room together. The atmosphere is super relaxed and many people just fall asleep during their treatment. May is a gentle soul and really listens to your problems and comes up with a realistic treatment plan for you. Since acupuncture has a cumulative effect it is best to go 1-2 times a week. Getting an appt. is easy and they do take walk- in's as well. I have told my doctors about this place so that more people can be treated and cost doesn't have to be the reason you don't at least try acupuncture. Thanks Mayo and now I can say \"I Sleep with Strangers at PCA\"
