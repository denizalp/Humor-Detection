Best entertainment at dinner ever. Period. The dinner was great, but the performers were outstanding. We had a company dinner, and surveyed everyone after the conference. If I remember correctly, across all the responses, Rose. Rabbit. Lie. got a 3.87 out of 4. I'm not going to Lie, it was pricey, but a very memorable experience for the group!
