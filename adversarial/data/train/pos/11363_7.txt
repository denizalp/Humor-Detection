It is 2012, a beautiful restaurant in upscale Rocky River and the owner still doesn't accept credit cards! So bizarre. We dined here for the first timelast Saturday night, everything was fine until waitress advised us cash or check only when bill came. \n\nWhen we asked if there is an ATM nearby, she said we had to drive to one. Really? If you want to be that greedy and inconvenience your customers, the least you can do is ensure there is an ATM nearby. Waitress gave us a bit of an attitude stating there was a \"sign\" on the front door. Well, when we walked in, a couple who was walking in front of us had the door open so we missed that \"sign\".\n\nOwner needs to advise servers to tell customers when they sit down about this ridiculous old fashioned policy.\n\nFood and atmosphere were good but we were so turned off that we will never return. Going to Tartines next time!
