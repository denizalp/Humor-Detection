The suites in the PH Towers are just perfect! They aren't janky and they aren't overly fancy schmancy. The rates are great too!\n\nWe got a one bedroom King suite for about $160\/night. The suite was very spacious and modernly decorated. It came with floor to ceiling windows that gave us a beautiful view of The Strip. It also came with a kitchen, spa tub, and a huge projection screen in the living room. \n\nI wouldn't mind booking with PH Towers again.
