Excellent, unique and funky, with portions eclectic and surreal, artistically macabre, occasionally sensuous, bodaciously Victorian, cool and hip, beatnik-ish and ultra-pop, gnarly and exceptional, exotic and mystifying, wickedly bizarre and melancholically entertaining - just a few thoughts that come to mind about this find.  Frequent exhibitions are always worth the visit... cannot wait for my next drop-in!  Well worth a visit, you'll find it intriguing and amusing!
