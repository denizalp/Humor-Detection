I live near this mall, and it's the only one within walking distance. Thankfully, I have access to a car, because this mall is terrible. \n\nI visit this mall quite often, and stores open and close on a monthly business thanks to the lack of business. It had 3 banks in the vicinity (TD and CIBC in the mall, Scotia right outside), which is a plus. The only other useful store in my opinion is Home Hardware, because Metro is an expensive place to grocery shop. The rest of the stores in the mall are quite small, and in my opinion completely useless, with the exception of a couple. \n\nThere's barely a food court; a nice pizza place, some Greek food, and one Chinese place. A Subway, Tim Hortons, and McDonalds right outside the mall. I suppose it's a nice place to have if you need a quick bite to eat, or just in case it's raining badly and you need some shelter. Other than that, I really wouldn't bother with this place.
