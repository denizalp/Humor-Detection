I bought a suit here as part of the \"Roberto\" two-for-one special to wear in a friend's wedding party.\n\nAfter the \"discount,\" the suit came to about $600+ with a generic tie.\n\nI've probably worn the suit about 20 times and have noticed a sleeve is already coming apart, less than a year after buying it. Today a pant pocket started to go.\n\nI wear suits every day, and they usually last many years, not months, like this one. \nSo you get what you pay for: and here it appears you pay for radio ads targeted at people who decide where to buy dress clothing based on radio ads.
