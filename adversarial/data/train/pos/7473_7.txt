Shady: illegitimate. underhanded. dishonorable. corrupt. sneaky.\n\nI walked in thinking this place was gonna be for those of us sneaky and corrupt individuals. Instead I find a bar made for some classy motherfuckers. Handsome wood walls and brick fireplace. Father John Misty playing on the jukebox. Sexy black leather tufted booths under dark mood lighting. And a finely crafted cocktail by a rad bartender. \n\nGet it.
