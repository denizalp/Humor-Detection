Trader Joe's is my favorite place to shop for groceries. They have organic items, GMO free items, super cheap cheese, nuts, and the best little treats known to mankind. I find myself here often, braving the atrocious parking deck, to pick up all the things I need for a great week of eating.\n\nService is also over-the-top friendly and helpful. I don't know what they are feeding employees, but they are all wonderful and genuinely seem to be enjoying themselves. \n\nI do love this location.
