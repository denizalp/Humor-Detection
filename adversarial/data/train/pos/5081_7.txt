This is my favorite place for Chinese lunch specials, and I make it a point to dine here during my periodic trips to herbal shop next door at the Chinese Cultural Center. The restaurant is clean and pretty cozy, the food is inexpensive and service is fast and efficient. You know you're getting authentic stuff when even simple lunch specials include ingredients like wood-ear mushrooms, succulent fish or shrimp, and perfectly cooked vegetables - none of the overcooked stuff that you often find in Americanized Chinese places.
