So I arranged a date for my husband and I, to The Void Star Wars VR experience then to The Black Tap Tavern for lunch (he must've asked me 1,000 times \"where's that place with the awesome milkshakes?\"). I got the Bam Bam Shake (aka Fruity Pebbles shake), Doug went with the Brooklyn Blackout (all chocolate). We also got burgers which we both agreed afterward we should've just split a burger. The shakes were so yummy, it's all about the shakes here, if you don't leave that place with a smile on your face after having one of their shakes, then you are lame. The burgers are just ok, they were good but nothing special, same with the fries. Everything is pricey but that's life on The Strip. Staff was great. Loved the Old School Hip Hop vibe. I'd for sure go back for a shake.
