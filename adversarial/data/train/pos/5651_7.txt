I'm a big fan of Thomas Street Tavern, in part because it's a great atmosphere, and also because it's right across the street from the Penguin.  Can you get any better?  Fried pickles at the Penguin and then beers and ping pong at Thomas Street?  No, didn't think so.\n\nRelatively cheap prices on their beers and a big selection is one of the main reasons we keep coming back here.  The last couple times they've been out of this beer or that, have to wonder if they have problems keeping their bar stocked or if they just have that much of a crowd. \n\nWait staff has always been good and friendly; quick with the beers or a recommendation.\n\nThe only thing I don't like is the creepy guy that tried to pop pills into my friends mouth.  You know who you are, creepy guy with dreadlocks.
