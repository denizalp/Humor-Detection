The Mrs. and I were heading to Scottsdale and we (I) needed a place to watch the Spain vs. Paraguay match.  AZcentral mentioned this as a great place to watch the World Cup....and they were right!  We could have watched synchronized swimming here and we still would have had fun.\n\nWe got there just as they were opening and picked a prime spot at the bar.  Actually, we could have sat anywhere and had a prime spot.  Kudos to whoever feng shuied the TVs in!  This is the best set up I have even seen for a sports bar.  You feel like you are on top of any tv you want to watch.  \n\nThere is even a place to dump your kids ( I mean a place for your kids to play)! They have cool Wii stations ready for a bunch of chicken finger- eating hooligans to enjoy.\n\nBeing that it was brunch, we ordered a spicy Bloody Maria & Bloody Mary( the mrs. doesn't do tequila) and started off with some chips & salsa with a side of guac.   The salsa was surprisingly good and so was the guac.  Both WAY above typical sports bar fare.\n\n The bartender was super cool, super cute, and a super drink maker!  What more can you ask for?\n\nThe bar wasn't busy, but there were a handful of World Cup fans that lent a fun atmosphere. \n\nOur bloodies came in these huge goblets and it took most of the half for us to finish them.  We scored with those suckers!\n\nHalf time gave us a chance to order.  We were not overly hungry due to the meal of a drink we had and of course all the chips.  Ended up splitting a Phoenix Philly.  Again, we were delighted with our order.  The sandwich was awesome! \n\nRecommendation: Get the side of cottage cheese with diced jalepenos.  I could have eaten a quart of that!\n\nRounded out the second half with a couple of beers.  They have pretty much anything you might want either on tap or in bottle.\n\nOur visit left us wishing we lived in Arcadia....within walking distance to this place.
