I ate the pulled pork sandwich and GOT FOOD POISONING!!!!!!\n\nIt was the only thing I ate that afternoon before flying home. When I got off the plane I was deathly ill and vomited violently the rest of the night.\n\nI will add that when I asked the waiter about the sandwich, he winced and recommended the burger instead saying \"it's  made from fresher meat\". I should have taken the hint, but the pork looked good and I has not in the mood for a burger .
