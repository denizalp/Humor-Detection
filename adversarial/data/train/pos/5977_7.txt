ok so i'm pretty sure that everyone who's been to ten mile aroma has been there for one reason: the $5 pitchers. from a drinking perspective, it's a great place to go - the beer tastes like beer, is cold, and has alcohol in it. ten mile aroma gets ten miles of stars for the beer prices.\n\nthe food is very hit-and-miss. i've been here a couple of times and in my experience, any stir-fried dish just tastes very salty and soy-saucy. as in, i've tried 6 dishes off of the menu that all tasted the same (salty soy sauce eggplant, salty soy sauce beef, salty soy sauce pork, etc.). however, i have also really enjoyed the dumplings and a few of the appetizers - especially the pork pancake. the portions are very big, and they don't skimp on the meat. also, the more beer you drink, the better the food tastes.\n\nthe atmosphere is definitely lacking, unless you enjoy watching chinese news on mute and odd smells. maybe you do?\n\noh ya, and the service isn't great - there's only one waitress for the whole restuarant and she's not exactly the most attentive.\n\nso basically, this place would be a 2\/3-star restaurant if they didn't serve crazy cheap beer. so it's up to you to decide whether the beer is worth it - i know that i'll be going back again.
