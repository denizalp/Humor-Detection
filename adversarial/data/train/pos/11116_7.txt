My favorite frozen yogurt place yet!\n\nFirst, on walking in, I'm not greeted with a mass of people all trying to do different things (enter, exit, fill their cups, pay) in the same square foot.  I'm greeted by space...and lots of it.  And friendly employees that acknowledge you and ask if it's your first time.  Wow, it's been a long time since I heard that question.  \n\nI'm also greeted by sample cups.  Where they should be.  And a menu with the day's flavors so I don't have to peer over everyone's shoulders to see what's there and then back track because I prefer the first flavor I passed.  And I'm greeted by plenty of choices in yogurt...all worthy of a place in my cup.  And plenty of choices in toppings.\n\nMy only suggestions would be to not crush up the candy so much...I want to know there's a Snickers in my cup, not Snickers dust.  And get a different brownie bite (steal them from Yogurt Land if you have too)!\n\nOther than that, I love Yogurtini!  And great outdoor space, too...even if it won't be usable for the next 6 months :(
