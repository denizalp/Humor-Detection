Why would I come to your place again. The first time is humiliating enough to be ask to leave right after dessert is served. \n\nI think your clarification was incorrect. As soon as dessert was cleared, we we were asked to leave. As I stated in 30 years of dining I never encountered such rudeness.  We  paid closed to $800 dollars for dinner. \n\nThe other people didn't want to sit outside. What make you think we wanted to sit outside? There were Mosquitos outside!\n\nPlease be nice. Don't treat us by the color of our skin! The world need more love and less hatred.
