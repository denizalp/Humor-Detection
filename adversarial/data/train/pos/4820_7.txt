What I remember most about Gandhi: the surprising interior and the tad expensive price tag on the lunch buffet (and my charming lunch companion). The buffet was large with plenty of vegetarian selections, and the food was good. I thought the flavors were tempting; they led me back for a second plate, but the vegetables were a tad overcooked, and hence, some things did not appear to be the freshest. Overall, I enjoyed my lunch, but when I find myself thinking about the interior and cost, I know that the food was not mind-blowingly delicious. At $12 the price is not the best value for Indian buffet, which is always a consideration for me. (The star rating is largely a reflection of the price.) Plus, since visiting Gandhi, I have revisited my go-to Indian buffet to confirm my taste buds preference.\n\nThe interior is quite impressive, a remodel since the days of the overhead carpet, and a stark contrast to the exterior surroundings. There are private rooms in the back, and I could see hosting a small private dinner here, as the restaurant feels spacious and nice. \n\nHowever, this may be the last time I stray from my tried and true all time fave Indian buffet in Vegas, as I think my taste buds might run away if I try to take them anywhere else!
