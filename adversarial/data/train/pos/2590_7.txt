This is surely one of the very few times I have been baffled. All the flowing reviews and pictures made me want to try this place. I guess I might be one of the few who did not find Earl's to be \"mind blowing\" omg drool spot. \nIt was a good sandwich but nothing amazing and certainly nothing I would advise anyone to go out of their way for. I orders the cannonball meatball sandwich. Sandwiches here are about $7 and although it makes a good late night snack, it's nothing I would schedule in my Vegas food itinerary. \nI still think the best sandwich is Wolfgang Pucks chicken aioli sandwich. To each his own.
