The whole reason I moved to Phoenix was for a job.  Yes, I got a job here in Phoenix and moved here just for that.  California was showing no signs of ever opening up the job market soon so I did what I had to do.  So far, I'm really liking it and finding some cool new places to go and great places to eat.  MacAya's is one of those discoveries.  \n\nAfter spending two weeks with a group of people in a training class, some of us decided to go out and celebrate with lunch on Good Friday, which was a half day for us.  The company was great and I found the place very easily so that was a plus too.  I thought the open patio was awesome and I can see this place hoppin on a Friday or Saturday night.  Even at lunch they had $2 beers!  \n\nThe service was a little slow, the chips and salsa were ok, and my enchiladas were pretty good, not great, but good.  Honestly, I think it's the atmosphere that got me though.  They had this big outdoor bar and lots of space on the patio, lots of tables and chairs.  I loved the outdoor waterfall too.  So in my opinion, the food is a 2 and I'm giving it another start for the atmosphere.  If you don't expect much when you go, you'll be fine  :)
