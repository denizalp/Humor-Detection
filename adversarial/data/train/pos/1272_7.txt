I would have to recommend that if you are looking for an attentive, thorough, professional health care provider to keep looking.  This office has been really going down-hilll for the past several years and has hit rock-bottom.  There is always a wait, usually 20-40 minutes past your scheduled appointment time.  They are impossible to reach by phone, and do not return messages or emails.  They charge patients their co-pay even on preventative visits such as biometric screenings and physical exams what are already covered at 100% by most insurance plans.  They also bill the insurance company for a full physical exam, when they aren't actually performing one. Mine lasted less than 5 minutes and the physician didn't even touch me!  The billing staff are as rude as they come, and could care less about anything or anyone.  I know that Blue Cross is currently investigating.  There are SO many physicians in Charlotte, there would be no reason to go here and receive sub-standard rude service.
