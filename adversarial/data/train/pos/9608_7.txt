Needed a place to grab a bite to eat and get some work done. Was very surprised to find out they don't offer WiFi.  I ordered a sandwich & soup combo. For the price you pay, the taste was mediocre at best.  They need to understand what a salad is and not lettuce shoved into a cup. Also when you use lettuce for a sandwich, don't use the hard core parts. \n\nThe bakery looked appealing, but the comments from the people behind me said it looked much better than it tasted so I opted not to get any. \n\nThe environment is cute and they have home decor for sale, but I can get the same items at Hobby Lobby for half the price. \n\nThis will not be a place I will jump on going back to anytime soon.
