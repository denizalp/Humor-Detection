Very disappointed. Good that the vendors are pound of bring to sell \"home grown\" products. But the variety is extremely limited. One selling only potatoes and yams or sweet potatoes. Another had green onions or sweet onions on her able. They don't need to convince me the freshness of merchandise. But you'll definitely have to go to a grocery store to complete the grocery list. I had high hopes for this place. A waste of time. Visited in the morning on a Saturday.
