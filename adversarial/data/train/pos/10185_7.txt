First time I came at midnight. The services fast and enough of parking lot. I was looking forward to try this tacos since I saw so many great reviews about this place. \nOnce I arrived, I noticed that the open hours was not 24 hours anymore, now they open from 9am till 3am everyday. \nThe price is around $2.99 for small size soft taco. I ordered steak, breakfast tacos, chicken, and tamarind drink. To me, the seasoning was just right but nothing special. Compared the other place, I found the other places have flavors so much better (plus more size of portion). \nI recommended this place for late snack and who like to eat small portion.
