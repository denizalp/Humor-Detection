I love the decor here. High walls and big windows. A bit dark, but classy. We were dressed to impress in our 1930's best for brunch and Corduroy didn't know what hit 'em. We were a very large party and the servers handled it pretty well. Food came out at different times, but not terribly staggered. In the meantime, we enjoyed some tasty carafes of mimosas. My crab cake eggs benedict was so fucking amazing. The only problem I could find was that my stomach wasn't big enough. \n\nMy husband got their special of the day, which was chicken and waffles. When it came out, he was just 'eh' about it. He didn't say anything because we were part of such a big group that it would only be more trouble to talk to someone about it, so he stuck it out. The server, in her infinite wisdom, came by and apologized for the plate, saying that it was the first time the chef had it listed on their specials, so they were going to play with the recipe a little more for the next time. They didn't charge him and ALSO gave him a to-go bag of the enchiladas!! Oh my gosh. We were over the moon. Since we were going to be on the road for the rest of the day, drinking on bikes, those enchiladas made two people living out of a shopping cart very very happy. Thanks for that, Corduroy!
