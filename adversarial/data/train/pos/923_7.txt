Got to party it up ping-pong style here for an awesome Yelp event and really enjoyed my night at Spin Galactic.  A word of advice getting here though, the venue is actually located on the cobble stoned King to Wellington lane way and don't get confused as there is an actual Spin bike studio in the same building, just walk by to the end of the building and down the stairway and you'll find Spin Galactic.\n\nIt's kinda weird picturing the idea of a ping-pong evening social club,  as the combination of black lights and ping-pong balls brings to mind freak-show girlie bars in Bangkok, but there's none of that type of debauchery to be found here!!! \nLike Daniel B says there is the usual \"King street vomit\" crowd playing Pong whilst wearing suits, platform pumps and Prada dresses, wtf?  But there were also some nice folks here just for a good time wielding some mad paddle skillz too.  It's also mega fun watching folks play pong whilst on the verge of getting sloshed and oh yes the drinks here are quite tasty (and $$) so it may be a challenge resisting the urge to lubricate.\n\nAmazingly enough this place gets suitably packed as we were here on a Monday night and upon leaving around 10:30pm there was still a lineup about 10 deep queueing to get in.  \n\nIf you're looking to change up the usual night out, and don't mind shelling out a little extra dough for the novelty of smacking some balls around, I'd definitely suggest getting your pong on at Spin Galactic.
