We organized an event for our girls softball team to get some batting in at Rip City.  First off, we get there and get ready to set up and the employee at the counter was already rude, literally immediately rude.  Its a batting cage, buddy, don't like your job, work somewhere else!!  We asked half way through our reservation if we could get two cages as we saw it would be beneficial for the girls and I was told, flat out, NO NO NO!  We offered to pay $20 even for less time as we had already started and the cages had 4 others open - which remained open the whole time we were there.  The employee said \"no way because then others show up with tokens\" - I asked if we could then get some tokens and the answer was \"no because you already reserved a space and you can not split your group\" - this doesn't make any sense what-so-ever!!  It was slow and, as mentioned, the 4 other (operating) cages remained open.  I dismissed this that the employee has a major chip on his shoulder because he was also arguing on his cell phone with someone saying \"I just need to get this job over and get the hell out of here today\" this while he was within earshot of young children.  As he passed now and then to get the balls sorted in the back, he would light cigarettes directly in the path of the cages!  I can not see how this employee has not been recommended to be replaced and how no one has already logged complaints!  What a jerk!  This place needs some serious management!  \n\nChandler and Mesa have way better, cleaner, nicer cages!
