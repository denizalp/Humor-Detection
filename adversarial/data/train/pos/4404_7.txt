This is my favourite place number 2 in Toronto, just after harbourfront. The market in itself is amazing. It is like some kind of hidden treasure cave. You walk the cold hallway of the ground floor seeing nothing but empty fance cloth shops and the Yorkville Club filled with strange alien womens whose body is a not so flattering tribute to the progress of cosmetic surgery (they all look like Brigitte Bardot zombie). And all of a sudden you see it. The paradise of food lovers. Well lit, smelling good, colored, serviced by far more employee that there are clients on location. The food is amazing. You like fish? They have all the best here looking as they have just jumped from their river, lake or sea. You like fruits? Vegetables? Don't go there. Moutains of pomegranates, tower of apples organic AND good looking, grapefruitslike that make you wonder if you have not been going to florida this winter after all, oignons that make you love them even if you don't. And this is only the beginning. Then there is the processed food. And they process it themselves. And they are good. The aromas when you walk up Avenue road don't lie! Most of their production is sold in the market itself but you can find some sample in the little cafe they have in the ground floor, a little 20th century's Europe heaven in 21th century high rise glass and metal nip&tuck purgatory. Here meet Bojan. The local angel. A breeze of hope that North American style capitalism can actually work. Or at least looks like it does.
