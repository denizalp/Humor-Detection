Ok. Ever seen one of those early Martin Scorcese films in NY where the characters eat in a diner\/deli? Well this place has that feel. A little bakery on the side with whitefish and tasteycakes. fresh challah bread. and the best damn chicken salad you will ever put on bread....but enough about the bakery.\n\nThis joint...and i call it a joint as a term of endearment is crazy good. Breakfast will send you home feeling like home. The lunch has these open face sandwiches that are monster and to die for. now don't get me wrong...this place aint too much to look at...but the food is amazing. If you live in Las Vegas or Henderson and if you ain't eating here then your a shmuck. NO SERIOUSLY.\n\nMan the Hash stack is crazy good with creamy horseradish and if you want a sandwich...ask for a box to take home when you order it. Pickles are great too. I once took my family here for a holiday breakfast...of course i knew i had to wait...but if they know you...your golden...so get to know the staff. Their great. They got us right in; then they wowed the fam. \n\nJust cause this place is a small and off the map doesn't mean it doesn't have a following. If you try to go in for breakfast on the weekend...you might wait...cause its that busy...FOR A REASON.\n\nWhile all the idiots go to islop or to a chain for breakfast or lunch...THE TRUE CATS KNOW WHERE TO GO FOR A DAMN GOOD PLATE.
