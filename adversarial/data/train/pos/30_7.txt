I am a big fan of Thai House here and the other one on Pima. I come here when I have a large group as the other one is smaller inside.\n\nAs often as I come here, I never had anyone complaining about their food before. Everyone I came here was pleased with quality of food they serve.\n\nMy ultimate favorite here is Mus-sa-mum. Always order with beef and spicy level 5. This curry is sweet, so the spicy level 5 is just perfect for someone like me, cannot handle too spicy food. I also love their Thai Fried Rice. Taste so much like Japanese fried rice (or fried rice in Japan).\n\nI ordered something new today, spicy eggplant. Surprised with rich flavor, I think this dish is going to be my regular item.  Pad thai, pineapple curry, yum woon sen, satay... they are some of my favorites too.\n\nPrice is very reasonable, we had seven people at lunch today and ended up being only $65 before the tip. We couldn't even finish everything we ordered.  Food comes relatively quick, great place to eat lunch.  I may not check in on Yelp as often as I come here but I am a regular here and the one at the Pima road.
