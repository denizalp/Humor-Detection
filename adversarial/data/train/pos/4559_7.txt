It should be 5 stars but it's a buffet 4.5* but I could go with 5!\nI'm a regular having been there for breakfast, lunch, weekends, & even holiday dates!\n\n- No sizeable line to speak of, worst case was 20 people ; smallest line was no one else & got right in\n- pricing is inexpensive & 1\/2 the cost compared to other buffets of similar quality & uniqueness like Bacchanal, Wicked Spoon, Bellagio\n- Healthy foods at a buffet like buffalo cauliflower, hummus, quinoa....\n\n- gluten free like rice congee, macarons...\n\n- more vegetarian stuff than anywhere else like beet hummus, rainbow chard, farrow, rainbow artisan cauliflower in purple & orange, baba ganoush, cous cous salad\n\n- Something for everyone like chilaquiles, corned beef hash with nicely poached egg, ham, turkey, pizza, shrimp cocktail in a pail....\n\n- unusual stuff not seen at other buffets like lamb, farro, white elotes, hot Cheetos™ elotes regular Cheetos™elotes, ceviche, salt & pepper wings\/drumsticks\n\n- try something you've not had before without feeling like you wasted any money like fresh lemonade with chia seeds (maybe chia's more mainstream than I know?) or shaksouka\n\n- the menu changes so it's different stuff even if I've gone there over 20 times it's definitely still exciting (well, I lead a very calm life)\n\n- chocolate dipped strawberries, gelato, mini m & m's, key lime parfait\n\n- really great service on clearing stuff & refreshing your coffee, tea, or milk, soda\n\n-hey, I even answered a bunch of questions about this AYCE buffet to help people out like not closing in between breakfast to lunch to dinner\n\nPS see you there, I'm going to do a yelp event here!!
