Gotta give the \"best pizza in Vegas\" award to Jimmie and his family from queens.  I grew up there and moved to California 30 years ago and now I drive over 6 hours 4 times a year to copulate those perfect pies. Order them plain like a true new yorker. Start with the garlic knots and a side of meatballs. If you don't like this place then go to the gun shop next door and eat a bullet, you deserve it.
