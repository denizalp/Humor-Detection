Thomas Sayre has done tons of other art installments you've seen around the city. (The big, clay discs on South blvd among others) \n\nI love seeing these big things on the way to Cotswold or heading back home\/Uptown. Apparently inspired by \"seed pods\" from floral bearing trees, they definitely stand out. The vine-y growth that has plastered itself along the bases add a nice aesthetic to the art as well. \n\nPerhaps something that is overlooked by most (maybe close to all), but I love them every time I see them. Here, here, Thomas Sayre!
