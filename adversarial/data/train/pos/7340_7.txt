I would have never thought to come to this show, but luckily my in-laws bought us tickets and we had a great time, even in the farthest seats in the house! Elton John was such a pleasure to watch and you can tell he gave all of the energy he could have all the 120 minutes her performed. I'm starting to realize now that these musical giants and legends are getting older and should be treasured when they are still around. Also - he took digs at Celine and Mariah in his intro speech, which I found hilarious! I recently saw Justin Timberlake live and was honestly so bored by his performance, but seeing Elton John really was captivating. He really shares his spirit with everyone. For those of you lucky enough to afford front row seats, the first 5 or so rows get to come up on stage during the latter part of the concert. \n\nMy only gripe - he didn't play Candle in the Wind and Can You Feel the Love Tonight?, which I was really looking forward to. Guess I'll have to catch him again :D
