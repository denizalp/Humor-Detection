My wife and I just arrived here in the Valley about a month ago and she wanted to go dancing at place that plays New Wave, 80s, indie, etc.--it's her preferred music to dance to.  Off to the Internet to hunt for a spot that features this on a Saturday night.\n\nOkay, here's a place called Sanctum.  We were amused by the reviews, and we had to see this one for ourselves.  The moment I walked in, I was impressed by the work that went into the decor of the place.  Thousands of dollars went into the \"Gothic cathedral\" look that seems to cover every inch of the place.\n\nSome have characterized the artwork for this club as being \"satanic\".  Maybe it would appear to be so to the uninitiated (and I use that term deliberately).  However, the symbolism and iconography of some of the club's decor is immediately recognizable to those who have an awareness of a certain body of mystical knowledge.  It's obvious that the person who designed this place didn't just pick a lot of random stuff--he knew what he was doing.\n\nCover charge was $5.  As someone from the San Francisco area where $10 (and up) covers are common at clubs, I found this to be pretty darn cheap.  Saturday nights feature \"Retro and Beyond\".  The music had a really good spread, and I heard my wife repeatedly remark about she hadn't heard some of the songs they were playing in a very long time.  Sound system kicked ass, and the DJ didn't allow a second of dead air.  The floor area was drenched in lasers, lights, and fog.  The club as a whole was well-maintained and clean as a whistle.  I've been to a number of scuzzy-looking clubs and this one stands apart from the rest in cleanliness--despite the eeeeeeevil look of the place, the maintenance and quality you get give Sanctum a touch of class.\n\nWe didn't drink any alcohol, but my wife's water was $3.  Pretty standard--all clubs have pricey drinks.\n\nSanctum is probably the coolest club I've ever been to and we will be coming back regularly in the future.  In the mood for something \"alternative\"?  You'll find it here.  Now, get your butt over to this place and shake it on the dance floor.
