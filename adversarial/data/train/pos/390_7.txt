Holy price increases value man! \n\nWe knew something was up when the faithful menu board was down, there are new glossy printed menus, with new higher prices to match. The falafel is now 4.49 up from 2.99 a 50% increase. Most other items went up by $1 to $1.50\n\nFor that price the falafel is rather small and does not include any sides.\n\nI still like the overall quality and taste of the food but the value factor bottomed out with this one move.\n\nOne a positive note we finally found a can of hummus on the grocery side that is good, and the fresh bags of pita are still .99 so you can still have a ton of pita and humus for $2.50 or less.
