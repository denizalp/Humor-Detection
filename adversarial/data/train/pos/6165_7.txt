The BEST biscuits of any fast food restaurant :D\nThat's not an easy feat, you know? They are just the perfect consistency, just a little flaky, not too sweet (it's not supposed to taste like a cupcake, lol) & it doesn't turn into a rock if you don't eat it right away. I likee! \n\n I also like that there are 2 exits from this restaurant. The one on Grand is easy to come in through, but not easy to exit from, lol. So on the way out I go out the back exit, which seems to lead into a paved alley and then exits onto the other side road. Easy peezy lemon squeezy :)
