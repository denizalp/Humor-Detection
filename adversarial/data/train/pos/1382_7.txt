You can't have a bachelorette party weekend in Vegas and not bring the bachelorette here! She was such a good sport. We had a stripper bring her on stage for a lap dance. It was C-R-A-Z-Y, I couldn't believe the things he did to\/with her. haha. It was fun and shocking to watch the ladies around you going ga-ga around these strippers. But hey, you only live once, so enjoy it! I didn't realize that there was a two drink minimum, but we had more than two drinks each.
