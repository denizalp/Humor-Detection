Can you give extra stars for cute barristas? That's probably unfair. Plus, it's unnecessary because Copper Star earns five stars on its own merit.\n\nPhoenix has yet to turn me on. Now, I am sure there are many hidden oases of awesome out here in the desert, but I haven't found many. Thank you, Copper Star for not being a mirage. I enjoyed your coffee. I'm glad you have free wi-fi  and I really like the feel of your cafe. I'd say it's crisp. That's the term I'd give to Apple products if I didn't dislike Apple. Crisp: you've got it, Copper Star. Next time I'm in Phoenix...let that not be soon, I'm going to linger at one of your tables and savor another cup of joe and be content.
