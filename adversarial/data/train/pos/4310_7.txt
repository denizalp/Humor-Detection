I haven't been to every donut spot in town yet, but so far this is my favorite.\n\nYesterday I was checking out the new Hot Heads Burritos and noticed Donut Mania. The donuts were calling my name so I stopped in. \n\nMy husband insisted on half a dozen donuts and I'm glad he did. \n\nMaple Bacon Cronut- loved the texture, the maple was great with the smoky bacon\n\nButtermilk Bar- this is where good shops set themselves apart, the actual donut was so delicious that it didn't need any toppings\n\nFruity Pebbles- definitely not a repeat of the stale version that Voodoo Donuts serves, the donut is moist and the Fruity Pebbles were still crisp. The cereal actually added a nice flavor to the donut\n\nVanilla Frosted- again, the donut had a great flavor and texture, frosting was the perfect sweetness\n\nButterfinger- yum! I loved the peanut butter filling inside and the amount of filling was perfect, the frosting on top was delicious\n\nCinnamon- loved the moist texture and taste\n\nEverything I tasted was moist and the epitome of how a good donut should taste. I loved that the donut itself was a treat and toppings were just a bonus.\n\nThe pricing was reasonable for the quality of the donuts. Donut Mania also offers a reward program through the Epoxy app. \n\nThe staff was very welcoming. Since they had just opened they were taking extra time to explain the flavors. The shop is colorful and inviting as well. \n\nGreat shop and amazing products. I hope they keep up the quality as the settle in.
