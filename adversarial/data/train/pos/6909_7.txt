In April of 2013 I lost my beloved Smokey at the age of 8. \n\nThe very next morning I went to WPHS and fell in love with two of the sweetest kittens on this planet, Gizzie and Tater [formerly Gray].\n\nThe shelter was pretty off about Gizzie's personality, though. They informed me that he was very quiet, calm, nervous and reserved. Oh if only they could see him now! Perhaps he came from a bad situation? I don't think I've ever met a louder or more talkative animal in my life and he ALWAYS wants to run around and play. \n\nWhen I sat with Tater in the little meet and greet room he hissed at everyone who walked by. I rarely had company over so I didn't see this as an issue if he didn't like any other humans. After about 2 months he couldn't wait to greet and love up on everyone who walks through the door! He even tolerates my neighbors 3 toddlers who constantly want to hold and pet him. \n\nThe staff was very friendly and helpful with everything. Both of my boys had all of their shots and were all up to date with everything. \n\nI couldn't be happier with my best friends!
