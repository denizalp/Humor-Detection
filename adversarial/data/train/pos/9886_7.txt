The sad little pool that the Gondola's drifted in was rather disappointing. I guess my expectations were a bit off.\n\nMy broke college-student arse only whimpered as we walked by the shops here such as Fendi, Coach, and Manolo Blahnik. 'Some day,' I hoped.\n\nAnd as if fate, the Gods of gambling, Ala etc. took pity on my poor soul and bestowed VGL (Virgin Gambler's Luck) upon me. \n\nAs my man-friend played $100 of blackjack, I decided to roam the Casino floor and play the only game I could figure out for myself. Dollar slots. And within 10 credits I won over 200 dollars! Might sound like chump change to you high rollers but not for me! I cashed that sh*t out with a quickness!!
