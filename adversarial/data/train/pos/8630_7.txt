I used to use MAC exclusively when I was married because my ex husband used to complain about the \"taste\" of my other makeup. As a girl who doesn't make out with other girls, or guys who wear makeup, I can't vouch for this feature for the MAC brand. \n\nOnce I became single again, I nixed my exclusivity with the brand because I found #1 it's costly and #2 there are better quality options out there. I didn't stop purchasing MAC products, but I definitely began to diversify my stash. \n\nOf all the products I've used from MAC, the only thing I can recommend above any other brand are their pressed shadows. The color and coverage is phenomenal. (Sue Devitt makes incredible loose powder rollerball shadows.)\n\nI've noticed that E.L.F. makes a better liquid liner that outperforms MACs gel liner all day, every day and is $13 cheaper.\n\nE.L.F. makes a better lipstick in the form of a twist up stick compared to MACs lipsticks. E.L.F. has a stronger pigment -a feature that MAC addicts love to brag about. \n\nTarte makes a richer pressed powder bronzer but it is slightly more expensive than MAC - but a compact lasts 2x as long. \n\nOne thing that MAC has going for it is their recycle program - bring in 6 used up MAC containers and get a free full sized pressed shadow or lipstick of your choice. \n\nI brought in 12 containers and got a free lipstick and a shadow. Unfortunately when I got home, I realized that the cashier gave me the wrong shadow as my freebie. Of all the colors that MAC makes, she gave me \"black tied\" - a glittery black shadow that I #1 already have #2 never use. Agh! There are no returns on freebies.\n\nThis location is chaotic. The sales people aren't of the caliber of other locations. They're unorganized and their makeup looks a bit... Scary. \n\nI'd suggest another location and triple checking your products before the walking out of the door.
