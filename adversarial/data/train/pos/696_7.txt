The Dump is really an.over priced big box.  We have check pricing on a couple items and found them for less at local stores.  We asked if they would match the price but they.said NO.  We saved over 200 from a small store called Home Spaces in Goodyear really nice people. We do have to wait 2 weeks.for delivery but for 10% savings or more why not. Also the delivery charges are really high 149. Vs 69 from other dealer  Will never be back.to.the Dump over priced with sales person following you around the store.  If you need customer service this is not the place for you.  Do your shopping before going to the.Dump
