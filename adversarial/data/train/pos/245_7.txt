If you want to get your nails done, please do not go here, or at least learn from my mistake. I had a 9AM appointment to get my nails done for a wedding next weekend. \nThey have minimal color selection for polish (first mistake; shouldn't have assumed a salon would have variety of pink colors) and don't do gel (second mistake; should have asked, since I wanted gel). The woman who did my nails also made it clear my manicure won't last a week and that I would need a new manicure before the wedding--for the amount of money they ask, I would hope a manicure would last seven days, but we shall see. \nThe nail tech's hands were shaking so much she ended up cutting me and cleaning it up with hydrogen peroxide...and then continued to use that wipe on my other nails. She also made a comment about \"not expecting to have all that dead skin\". I had to ask her to refile my nails more than once cause the edges and corners were not done well. \nOverall, my nails look like something I did myself and not worth what I spent.
