They have done me over big time...so i will starve to death and die.. They loose all my information and i am the one to suffer.\nIt is almost impossible to talk to someone to fix the problem that they have created. I am positive this is all a politiacal scheme to play with unenployment numbers.\nAnyone else have problems lately?
