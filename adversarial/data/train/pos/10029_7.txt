I love the concept and space at K@A! The menu is refined, the space is modern, the crowd is grown-hipster. I've been by twice and the beer menu is a thing of wonder (the Chai on draft is perfect for fall!), but food execution seems to vary based on who's in the kitchen.\n\nI love seeing beef tartare on a menu, and this one with cured egg yolk was sufficient but would benefit from a bit more seasoning. The Mexican-influenced Caesarette with grilled cactus and corn nuts was a surprise hit, and I really like the lime in the dressing. An entree-size version would make a great vegetarian dinner! Props for having a spaghetti squash shakshuka and a veggie burger for those who are unable to eat meat.\n\nChicken thighs are the cut I work with most at home, and I really liked the gravy and chicken-fried mushrooms used in the preparation here, but it was a touch salty and the cuts of meat were oddly small and rubbery in texture. My guy opted for the Surf & Turf and the giant tiger prawns were easily the star of this dish, while the tenderloin was a touch tough. We shared the PBJ Bread Pudding, made with brioche. The flavor profile successfully nailed the nutty-sweet balance, but the hot buttered sherry sauce was unnecessary and overpowering. Perhaps it's because we went in right at their 4PM opening, but the dessert was also cold in the middle as if it'd just been taken from the refrigerator. \n\nWe were informed that they were training new kitchen staff, which may explain some of the missteps above. I really am a fan of the menu and the space, and will be revisiting to try other dishes (specifically the wings and scallops!) in the hopes that the execution will be a bit tighter than my last visit.
