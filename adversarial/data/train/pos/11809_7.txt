The other night while a bit inebriated, my friends starting talking about ordering a pizza and I started looking forward to eating a delicious slice of NY style plain cheese.\n\nThe opted to go for Sicilian crust. I was crushed and started fantasizing about NY style and this desire was still there when I woke up!\n\nSo a couple days later, I search Yelp for the best NY style pizza near me.\n\nNow, I have my go to pizza places for \"in-between\" crusts, but not for thin.\n\n(My totally personal understanding of pizza crusts is as follows:)\nNY style: difficult to hold with one hand. Super thin, cheesy, greasy, yum\nInbetween: A fair amount of crust but not overpowering. Capable of holding multiple toppings\nDeep Dish: Self explanatory and generally not my bag\n\nNow, to satisfy my NY style craving, sources pointed to Fiori's, which I love and grew up on, but wasn't in the mood for, and Slice. I opted to give Slice a go!\n\nThey don't deliver out my way (bummer,) so I drove 10 minutes or so to pick it up. The inside of the restaurant is small, 3-4 tables and then the counter. The other patrons were friendly and talkative and made me wish that Slice had been open when I lived in Beechview as I'm sure I would have been a regular. Service was also very friendly and fast.\n\nDid the pizza live up to my 2-day long daydream? Not quite, but it was still very good. I'm still on the hunt for my favorite thin crust but this was a pretty good contender. But what's really going to keep my coming back to slice are the hoagies! I'm not typically a huge fan, but the description of the Italian sold me and I was not disappointed. From the varierty of meats and cheeses to the baguette style bun it was served on, it was delicious. Will happily order again.
