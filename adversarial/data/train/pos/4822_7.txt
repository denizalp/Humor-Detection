Let me preface the 3 stars by saying this is far from a bad review. Pita House is good, and the folks were friendly. But when you compare the expectations flavorwise they fell just a bit short.\n\nThe Shwarma, Kafta,Hummus, Salad, Pita, and Rice at our meal was enough to curb a Mediterranean craving. But when stacked up with local contemporaries of the hummus game, Pita House is certainly at home in the middle. \n\nIve read great things about the Shwarma wrap, and sure enough the first bite was delicious. But I feel a lot of that was thanks to the garlic sauce, which like a secret weapon left the rest of the wrap vunerable in the taste department. \n\nI feel the best meals are those which you don't search for the salt and pepper, and here I found myself reaching for both. But regardless I'd still give the dishes of Pita House a solid B-.
