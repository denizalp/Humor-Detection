IKEA is a fun store, they have some really great deals on furniture and home furnishings. Yes, it's pretty busy right now since the grand opening was last week but it's not as busy as I thought it would be. The food here is also really good but my complaint is regarding their IKEA Family \"eat for free\" deal. We noticed their signs throughout the store stating that if you purchase food your cost will be applied to any home furnishing purchase over $100. We thought this was great! Especially considering we spent over $40 on food. Yes, we noticed some dates on the bottom of the flier at the dining tables but we read the fine print and nowhere did it say what those dates represented. We realized that those days fell on weekend days and thought they had to be blackout dates. We re-read the flier and again it didn't say anything. So we went with our first impression. Yep, we get the to the checkout counter and the cashier said she had no idea what we were talking about. First off, an employee should know what kind of promotions their company is running. Well, luckily I took a picture of the flier and showed her and she said quickly \"oh those are for those dates only\". Hmm funny how the flier didn't say \"only on the dates listed below\". I'm sorry maybe it's supposed to just be known but I really didn't get that from the flier itself. They need to work on their advertising.\n\nOverall, if you've got a new home or apartment, this place is a good place to buy your first couch or bedroom set. The couches aren't very comfortable (I know this because my roommate had purchased one in the past) but you get what you pay for. I've mostly only bought home accessories when I've gone to IKEA like a wine rack, bath rugs, vases, etc. The deals for such items are pretty great. Just disappointed that we didn't get the \"eat for free\" deal.
