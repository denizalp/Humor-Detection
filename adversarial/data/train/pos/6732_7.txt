I hate it when I go back to a restaurant I like and the food is not as good as before.  We came by 2 weeks ago.  Wanted a light meal before a meeting.  \n\nOur server, Brenda was very nice and professional.  We ordered the following...\n\nTomato soup - it was over spiced and very acidic.   I couldn't eat more than one spoonful.\n\nLobster tacos - I have no clue where the lobster was.  Didn't taste like anything to do with lobster.  Honestly couldn't make out what was in that yummy black corn shell.  It tasted okay but not something I'd ever order again.\n\nChile Relleno - it was filled with cheese and grilled eggplants.  I didn't try it but my husband enjoyed it.\n\nPassion fruit cheesecake - delicious!\n\nCarrot cake ice cream sandwich - looked pretty but difficult to eat.  My husband ate the ice cream but had a difficulty with the hard shell.\n\nBrenda removed the soup from our check.  The service was amazing as before (everyone).  The food was not as good as before.  May be back at one point...hope next time will be better.
