Love Tango Palace for soooo many reasons. To name a few:\n\n1. the wonderful atmosphere... at the risk of sounding like a walking cliche, this is the BEST coffee shop to get some writing done... i can just zone out;\n2. great music... i rarely take off my headphones in a cafe...Tango's is good fun;\n3. Wonderful staff- warm, friendly, always ready with a joke or wink... they make my day;\n4. Patio in the back! Great for sneaking in a smoke or fresh air paradoxically.\n...what am I forgetting. Oh! \n5. the coffee. lol.Right. Hands down great snack and drink selection. \n\nNo longer live in Leslieville but seriously considering making the trek to frequent this go-to again. \n\nI RECOMMEND: Fighting for the window seat. It's worth it if you're a people watcher lol. \n\nEXTRA TIP: Watch out for the 'coons in the patio area. They run sh*t and one nearly pissed on me.\nDO NOT MAKE EYE CONTACT, I REPEAT, AVOID EYE CONTACT WITH THE RACOONS. It's real.
