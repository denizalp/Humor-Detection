My favourite late night snack restaurant and bar on Crescent Street. The atmosphere here is awesome with great tunes (hip hop and r&b) playing on their multiple TV screens. The bar is also decorated with Christmas lights! There's also attentive and social waiters\/waitresses that work here. Great customer service overall.\n\nI highly recommend their \"Warehouse Crispy Mac N' Cheese\" with Braised Beef ($1.99 extra) dish and \"Union Street Noodle Salad\". All their snack plates are $4.95 plus tax! What a steal for quality food. Their portions are good but if you are very hungry I recommend ordering two dishes.
