Went here on a whim w\/ my companion last sat 2 try it out. Last time I'd been here was w\/ an associ8 back when it used 2 b China Star. Seemed pretty much the same setup\/layout except w\/ a sushi bar & more of a dessert selection. They also had tapioca but I didn't partake of any due 2 the color looking a bit 'off'. Coulda been the lighting but chose not 2 risk it.\n\n   The interior is pretty decent 4 what it is, better than other buffet places & w\/o the stinky carpet! I Remember when this used 2 b a Red Lobster back in the day b4 China *. At the entrance they have a nice li'l area where u can c all the beautiful Koi fish swimming around. A child or (kid~@~heart's) delight ~ a li'l boy was having a ball, screeching w\/ excitement.\n\n   We chose a booth in the corner, which was our mistake as we were ignored 4 most of our time there (or Maybe unseen if giving more benefit of the doubt, even tho the demeanor of the so~called server(s) w\/ the exception of 1(whom we ensured got our tip) makes the 1st st8ment more likely. We kept getting scratched up because both our booth seats were ripped & the attempted tape on the 1 side kept sticking more 2 his skin than covering what was intended. Perhaps they got that way as a result of 2 many who gorged themselves there. Hee~hee\n\n   Anyhoo, the place has about 100 or more selections of entrees, soups, all fave appetizers 2 pick & choose from, most of them being seafood items of course, hence it's name but there's also veggies, fruit, noodles, salads, toppings, ice creams, cakes & all vari8ions of meats 4 the carnivores . The sushi bar is off seper8ly as expected 4 cold items & has a picture board 2 help identify the different kinds & their contents. This turned out 2 b my favor8 4 the california rolls (iniri was pretty good 2)!  I might have missed it or perhaps was a little overwhelmed by all the choices but was disappointed I couldn't find the wasabi which I'd usually blend w\/ a little water\/soy sauce 2 lessen it's kick. Even w\/o sauce they were really good, just would have enjoyed it even more w\/ it.\n\n   The only thing I'd do differently (other than sitting @ a different booth) is 2 get there when they open 2 enjoy everything @ their freshest, but really can't complain as it's equivalent 2 a Golden Corral w\/ more of an oriental flair & a vast array of seafood dishes @ a decent price! And of course we'll look 4 the pretty latino gal ~ the only Nice\/real 'server' we encountered, who saw we were w8ing 4 refills & immedi8ly tended 2 that as she just came in 4 her shift. Will get her name on a future visit & this place is defin8ly a nice option 2 have in the area... we left stuffed! So if u like 2 experiment, sampling several different things 4 ur palate, this might b the perfect place 4 u 2 do so...
