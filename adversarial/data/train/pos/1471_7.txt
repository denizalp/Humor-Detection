The littles and I came in on a weekday afternoon. They were all super excited and love this place. I was excited to finally give this place a try. It's a clean bright store with lots of white finishes. They manage to keep it sparkly inside, despite the messy sandwiches and hot dogs full of goopey ice cream! \n\nWe walked up to the counter and picked the cookies... They offer vegan double chocolate chip, snicker doodle, and banana walnut chocolate chip! Use your yelp check in for a free cookie with five dollar purchase! They warm up the cookies and you pick your ice cream. They offer a wide variety of flavors so be prepared to struggle when picking! They have two vegan soy options, vanilla (creamy and soft) and mint chocolate chip (decadent with the right amount of crunch). We picked the vegan snicker doodle with vanilla soy ice cream. They have toppings for $.50 cents each. The little insisted on Oreos. Since they are vegan... We went for it. The boys ordered their cookie sandwiches with regular cookies and ice cream and really enjoyed them. I was only able to sneak in two bites of the vegan sandwich... But it was really good. Definitely couldn't finish one myself... But the little seemed to have no Problem doing it alone. Our free cookie was the vegan banana walnut chocolate chip... We broke a small piece off and tasted it... And it was great. We saved the rest for my boyfriend who said it was really good. \n\nThe prices are fair... 4.99 for a vegan cookie sandwhich and 3.99 for the regular ones. They also offer ice cream tacos, lemon bars, brownies, and other decadent treats! I am probably more of a gelato person, but I would definitely go back and order again. :)
