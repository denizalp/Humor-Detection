Airport food, amirite? Then Brioche Dor√©e steps up and offers a damn fine sandwich: the turkey, apple and Brie on baguette. \n\nNot just baguette, freshly toasted baguette that softens the fruit, runs the cheese (just enough) and warms the bird.\n\nAs I run haphazardly from the tip of Concourse E to the tip of Concourse B, I wholeheartedly believe my usual staple sustenance stop of Bojangles will be bumped in favor of this tuck away counter service that toasts sandwiches better than any stale Quiznos.
