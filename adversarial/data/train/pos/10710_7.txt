Yum. \nI have to sneak to taco bell, because my guy is on the non gmo, all organic kick. Taco bell has teamed up with doritos, I had the spicy\/firey taco today and it was great.... \n\nTaco bell has also teamed up with chef Garcia... Who has been on top chef masters (bravo). They are really trying to make a difference taste\/quality wise with that line. Had the nicest encounter with a 'Timothy' today.\nNot authentic enough for ya ? Boo hoo... You want \"more authentic\" Tacos ? Go somewhere else. \n\n No complaints!
