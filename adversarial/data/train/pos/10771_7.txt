The Fork That Roared.\n\nFor some reason, maybe due to the name, I thought this restaurant would be just a step above a Chili's or a TGIF--that is to say, a chain restaurant. I should have known better, however, since Lynn W. selected RF for her birthday dinner--and she has excellent taste.\n\nThe basket of assorted breads was a fantastic way to start the meal. And the seared scallop appetizer was worthy of a good old-fashioned plate licking--but I abstained. When my pork tenderloin arrived my stomach jumped in anticipation. The tenderloin stretched the breadth of my plate, anchored by a dollop of cheesy grits, and topped with grilled corn and a wonderful sweetly tart sauce. The pork was very tender and cooked until it was rosy in the middle, as I had requested. I never order pork in restaurants because I'm always afraid it will be dry. But after eating each delicious bite of this tenderloin, I will certainly start ordering more pork.\n\nI skipped dessert because I was so full. Instead I sat and marveled at how good the food is at Roaring Fork and took in my surroundings. The ambiance confused me a little, I'll admit, as I couldn't tell if it was supposed to be a fine dining restaurant or something more casual. Regardless, everything I ate was delicious, and everyone in our party agreed. I would definitely recommend this restaurant and will happily eat here again.\n\nPlus there's the bonus of being able to play with the branding iron in front of the rotisserie in the entryway when it's late and nobody's watching. ;)\n\nRawr.
