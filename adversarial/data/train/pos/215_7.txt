This company rents on a variety of sites such as Airbnb and VRBO. I've rented numerous places on Airbnb that happen to be in Palms Place from other people but I won't do business with StripView Suites again. They attempted to collect a cleaning fee directly from me instead of Airbnb (which is against Airbnb's terms of service). I agreed to pay it through Airbnb but then they lied to me saying the building requires it. Customer service for their company was not great. In short there are so many great companies to rent from don't choose this one
