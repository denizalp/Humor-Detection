MUST READ\nI bought the groupon, thought it was a steal. Sounded amazing. I gave this one star because it didn't allow me to give it zero. \nThe fact they call this a 70 minute massage is a crime and false advertising. There's no way any one in there has any professional massage training. \nI'm not a snob by any means, just a 26 yr old guy that wanted a nice massage to get the kinks and knotts out of my back and shoulders. \nThey march you into this large room with drapes, where there's like 10 people getting a massage. They don't even have private rooms or real massage tables, they're these small Asian uncomfortable things. They put your feet in this bucket with a plastic bag of hot water for the \"foot detox.\" And that's that. \nThey massage itself.. The worst I've ever had, hands down. Anyone of my gfs had better technique than this massage. \nThey start with a terrible head massage then they go to the neck then the arms. I love arm massages because I'm an athlete and need them loose and feeling great. She literally just \"pushed\" down on them moving up and down each arm. No rubbing or lotion or oil. I couldn't believe it. At this point in the massage I almost got up and demanded my money back, but I really wanted to see if it got any better. \nThey spend about 15 minutes rubbing a rock on your feet and calves. It was awful. \nI literally can't say enough bad things about it. \nI bought one other groupon for my sister in law. I am emailing groupon to try and get my money back. \nDo Not Buy This!
