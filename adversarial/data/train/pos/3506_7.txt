absolutely perfect. \ngrilled cheese, crinkle fries, diet coke in a can, the morning newspaper, a slight hangover, cozy booths, 2 taxidermied deer heads staring at me...how could it NOT be absolutely perfect? \nservice was good, food came out quick, prices were right. customers ranged from the oldest man in the world, to a 20-something girl in her fuzzy pajamas with dreadlocks down to her butt, to a burly trucker sitting alone reading a romance novel.\ncannot wait to go back.
