MISION: TO FIND THE TASTIEST TACOS ON LAS VEGAS STREETS\n\nWHO: STREET VENDORS AROUND LAS VEGAS (Brick and Mortars like Los Tacos and El Gordo DON'T COUNT)\n\nOur second stop, this stand is located across Playas de Cancun Restaurant on Thu-Sun, 3pm-1am(2am if busy)\nTacos are $1.50 each (Ko Mex size) and they have the following: Asada, Al Pastor, Lengua(Tongue), and Tripas((Intestine)\nwe tried ech one and they were pretty good. Street Vendors always have other special items with funny names.\n\nWe also tried a Vanpirito, basically tortillas are toasted(Tostada), and topped with cheese and your choice of meat for $2.00 we got ours with Carne Asada\nStreet vendors usually have their own condiment bar, so when you go to any vendor, the ordering is simple:\n\nWhat you want, How Many, and the kind of meat, and you finish it on your own however you choose.\n\nOverall, pretty solid tacos and we'll definitely return!\n\nPROS:\n\nQuick, efficient service\n\nOpen late, Thu-Sun 3pm-2am\n\nSolid Tacos\n\n\nCONS:\n\nNo Al Pastor Carousel\n\nTacos can be a little greasy for some\n\n**RECOMMENDATIONS**\n\nThe Lengua and Tripas are worth a try, and the Vanpiritos are pretty good too....ALOHA!!!\n\n\nYELP 365 CHALLENGE-(166\/635) \"Street Taco Scramble-Part 2\")
