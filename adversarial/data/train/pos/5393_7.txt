This VV is great, there are actually less 'ugly' items than other VV's I've been to (Hwy 7\/Weston and  Steeles\/Dufferin location). Prices are excellent compared to other thrift shops I've been to downtown (69 Vintage Collective, VV on Bloor\/Lansdowne, Vintage Depot) but after reading some reviews it seems like VV have really increased their prices over the past few years as more and more cool kids are starting to shop here.\n\nThe store is well-organized according to type of clothing and size. Seriously, who organizes by COLOR, like other stores I've seen...\n\nMy last trip, I picked up a J. Crew classic fit dress shirt and a cute grandpa-looking cardigan for about 7-8$ each. I nearly shrieked in excitement when I found the J. Crew shirt. Dramatic, much?
