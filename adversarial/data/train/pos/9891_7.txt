As a forward, I grew up in the cosmetology business my family owns several schools and salons. \n\nI walked in to J Romer's salon and asked for a beard trim. The guy, Jason I believe, said no they don't do that and told me to go to a barber shop. I explained I just wanted a quick trim with trimmers (a 30s service). He still said no and that he didn't have time for my service today. \n\nBeing that I'm optimistic I know this is not true. For the time it takes to do the service. Anyone could squeeze it in. I wasn't trying to pull him away from his customers, I would have waited until he was done or while he could have done it during a chemical, or he could have told me when his lunch was and did it really quick then. \n\nHeck I would have paid him full price plus a tip for a service if he would have let me do it myself.\n\nI'm sure they do great services..it is an Aveda salon, which is nice. Place is very clean and smells great. Bonus star. \n\nAll in all, I needed a go to salon (since I'm new to the area). None the less this is not the place.
