I was really excited to try this gelato place because they had halo halo as a flavor. Their take on it wasn't the best, and I expected more ube flavor. The gelato tasted more like the toppings of halo halo, rather than halo halo as a whole. I also got a scoop of their salted caramel mango which was really good. It's sweet and salty, and very smooth. If you're in the area, I'd give it a try but not worth driving out of your way for.
