In Scottsdale, only the whitest most purebred and pedigreed children of a 50s sitcom are kept on staff here to fetch the trophy wives driving their escalades and hummers on ten thousand dollar rims hamburgers that they're just going to puke up later.\n\nIt's too bad, because it's not that bad of food considering.  The meat comes from special farms and is never frozen.  There are no freezers even in the stores.  It is better food than most people eat in this town.  I've seen what you buy in the grocery stores.  I'm shocked you had the energy to carry your things out to your car.\n\nOkay.  Maybe I'm exaggerating a little.  The fact of the matter is that the food here isn't put together as well as some of the other more working-class neighborhood locations, but is still some of the best fast food you can lay your hands on.
