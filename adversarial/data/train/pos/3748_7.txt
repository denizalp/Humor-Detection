Nitaya's food is still only okay by way of Thai food, but the service is amazing.  So much so, that ti deserves a five star.  The server there, a funny, thoughtful guy in his 20's (whose name I've forgotten--dang!)\n\nI showed up here yet again with Nicolle and Carol and even though Nicolle had a problem with her dish, he was kind, friendly and very cool about returning the dish for another.  He also managed to keep thte table constantly full of water or any other food items, which was fantastic.  The best part, however?\n\nHe made a reference to \"Pedagogy of teh Oppressed.\"  Any waiter at a Thai restaurant who can cite the brilliance that is author Paolo Friere, deserves to have his restaurant kicked up a notch.  Fantastic.\n\nNow, can we make the food a bit more exciting next time?
