In response to Jenni McKeena as I quote what she previously said \"McKenna Property Management seems to be taking the blame.\" Well that is a given, when you are the property management company. You are there to handle any problem that will arise, both on the tenants or owners side. As a company you have taken that responsibility and all the BLAME that comes with it. However, your company is passing it self off as an innocent party, when it is not. It was a nightmare calling your company because almost everyone I spoke to had sass, spoke down to me, and were unprofessional. I'm still waiting on my security deposit after the given 30 days by law and your company seems to continue to have no answers for me. Now I have the daunting task of coming down to your office to pick up my check or I'll never get it! \n\nAfter I have my money, I will be happy to no longer think of your company. And as you said \"I wish you luck in the future!\"
