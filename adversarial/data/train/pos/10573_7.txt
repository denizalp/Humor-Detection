Came here for my birthday yesterday because it's my friend's favourite place. It was a great day for their patio which would make the experience perfect but they only had a table inside by the door. \n\nThe ambiance is warm and comfortable, have the natural Ossington feel to it. The staff was very relax and friendly. Since this was my friend's favourite restaurant he did all the ordering. It was a good selection of dishes.\n\nWe had the Kale Salad which tasted perfect with shredded cheese; \nBlue crab avocado salad which tasted like tuna to me, didn't like it too much; \nCalamari and shrimp mango salad, the shrimps were perfectly made, very juicy and flavourful;\nShort ribs with Caramelized onions was my favourite, tender ribs covered in thick dark sweet onion sauce but with a bit of bitterness;\nwe had a salmon dish which was also very good, smoked salmon is always very good;\nArctic char ceviche with green apple and ginger, the apple added a nice fresh taste to it;\nalso had a steak dish which I forgot the name, it was also very good.\n\nWe had both desserts that were offered, I particularly liked the spring roll fruit with ice cream. Very yummy.\n\nHighly recommend and would go back again for sure. Great spot for a nice intimate date.
