I stumbled upon L'Amour Beauty while I was walking around downtown and popped in.  It's a cute little store that sells Asian cosmetics.  I had a really good experience there.  No one followed me around or pushed products on me.  A sales person approached me and asked if I need help and when I said I was just looking around, she left me alone.  When I had a question, I asked her and she answered my question and then left me alone again to browse.  I ended up getting a mascara (Kiss Me Heroine Make Volume and Curl Super Waterproof Mascara - I find the super long Asian names hilarious!).  I found the price quite reasonable.  With taxes, it came out to $18, which is about the same price as on Amazon or eBay and you get it right away as opposed to having to wait for it in the mail.  I mean it might be cheaper in Asia, but I expect to pay a premium for imported items.  \n\nThey had a clearance table with marked down items.  They had some eyeliners for $1.99 and other makeup for less than $5.  They also had some Rilakkuma stuffed animals.  So cute!!\n\nThey had tons of fake eyelashes, and lots of circle contact lenses in non-prescription and also prescription strengths.\n\nAdmittedly, the only Asian cosmetics I like are mascara.  In general they have amazing staying power, and they hold a curl all day long.  Other stuff, I don't find them anything special over what we have here.  I don't wear fake eyelashes or circle lenses, and I don't use those unusual uniquely Asian items like \"eyelid tape\" and \"ear floss\" - what the heck?!?  Hey, if this is your jam, go nuts, but none for me thank you! LOL.  So if I'm in the area in the future, I will pop by for some mascara and check out the clearance items for sure :)
