In Town Square and was tough to find even after looking at a map. It's near The Bahama restaurant and Mac Make-up. It's a modest space and smells great. Best customer service. I wanted to tip her more.\n\nThere were samples of 2 different breads. White chocolate something and a bacon & onion. Both were fabulous. I purchased the loaf on special (bacon&onion) for $3. Then I ate the whole loaf in one day (with my lover). I ate it alone (great), with jam (great) and as a grilled cheese (so great).\n\nIf only I could tough out trekking to Town Square more often I'd go every week. The price is right for artisan bread. There are so many more to try. I highly recommend.
