The best Bengali sweet shop in Toronto. This is the Scarborough branch of the chain from Mississauga. Mouth watering collection and amazingly fresh. They have a very wide variety of sweets, so far I have tasted the followings:\n\n1. Sanar Toast  (moderately sweet)\n2. Cream Jamon (sweet)\n3. Malay Curry(it's not curry, it's just the name) (sweet)\n4. Laddu (sweet)\n5. Kheer Toast (moderately sweet)\n6. Saffron Toast(not sure about the name) (moderately sweet)\n7. Balushai (moderately sweet)\n\nMost people do not like the overly sweet taste of Bangladeshi\/Bengali sweets or desserts. Premium sweets understands that very well. They allow you to sample taste the sweets if it is your first time, so that you can make your decision. People working here are very friendly and puts customers first. The sweets are best enjoyed at close to room temperature as the cream and syrup oozes out and fills your mouth. This is the only sweet shop from the Indian sub continent that I will recommend to people from other ethnicity with a sweet tooth.
