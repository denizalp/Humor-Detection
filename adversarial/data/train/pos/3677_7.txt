With a million entrances to Sherwood park, I am still not exactly sure where to park! But all that aside, this park is amazing. It has large pieces of green field for picnicking or for kids to run around, a decent sized playground, washrooms, water fountains, and an off leash trail. \n\nIt's not ideal to let your dog off leash at the trail if he\/she doesn't listen to your command, because there are quite a few paths to venture off. The trail is pretty much covered in shades so it is super ideal on a hot sunny day. People here are usually super chill and nice.
