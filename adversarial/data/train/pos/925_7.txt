This place is perfect for a quick sandwich or salad. Usually when I come I get the chipotle raspberry chicken which is awesome. Today I got the veggie which was pretty amazing. My friend got the chicken pesto which was also really good. Unfortunately the sandwiches don't come with any chip or sides, but just a few cut pickles. Otherwise they have a good assortment of bottle beverages and teas. All in all it was a good experience.
