Excellent service, wonderful ambiance, average food. Located right at the northeast corner of Bay and Wellington, this is a decent option for a) people watching the suits walking by, b) enjoying a wonderfully classy, trendy ambiance, and c) appreciating fantastic service (I can't recall our server's name, but he was a gem!). \n\nI visited on a weekday evening with friends after work, and it was relatively busy. Overall, it was a fine evening despite the food being sub-par. I ordered the Ricotta Ravioli ($24.00) and a glass of wine - note that portion size is quite small - I also had bites of the Braised Short Rib Risotto and the Roast Chicken Breast from my friends' orders, and consensus was that the food was pretty average. You're basically paying for the ambiance and location, not for truly delicious food.\n\nHowever, what they lack in subpar food, they make up for in service and experience. Wonderfully friendly staff, helpful without being overly pushy. Great lighting and classy décor. Overall, it's a decent option for a meal in the Financial District for lunch or after work, particularly if you want something in the heart of your work area and you aren't willing to walk (or drive) too far. But, if your priority is delicious food over ambiance\/convenience\/service, I'd go elsewhere.\n\nFor one entrée and a glass of wine, I paid around $45.00.
