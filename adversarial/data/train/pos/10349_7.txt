The ambiance is amazing. The levels, the lights, the mariachi band, everything about the place screams 'great Mexican food'... except the food itself. We started our dinner with chips and salsa. They were amazing, but weren't free. I'm not going to complain about it, just letting you know that before you walk in the door. My date ordered the 'Enchiladas De La Abuela', which I imagine is a vegetarian dish despite the description since there was little to no meat to be found in them. The sauce covering them tasted like chili powder, flour, and water... end of list. It was completely bland and lacked any discerning flavor. I ordered the 'Mar y tierra OK maguey'. They rolled it out on a cart and lit the skewers on fire in an attempt to add a little flare to the evening. The fire must have burnt any spec of flavor that may have been on them because I surely didn't taste any. The shrimp tasted like they had been marinated in sea water overnight before being boiled in a saline solution and served to me. The steak tasted like a vampire had gotten to the cow before slaughter. Every ounce of flavor had been drained out of it somehow and replaced with the heavy taste of salt. Salt I'm they got from the shrimp's marinade. Baby birds eat better meals than the one I had last night. If the place burned down, the ashes would taste better than the garbage I was served. And to add insult to injury, the bill was ridiculously high, an automatic 15% gratuity had been added, and we were forced to pay for drinks that the server dropped off without either of us ordering them. The highlight of my evening was the moment my face met the cold air as I walked out of the building. What more can I say? Eat @ your own risk.
