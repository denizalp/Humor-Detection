Best supermarket in Madison.  They've got everything you need.  Prices are really good, I'm convinced.  (yeah, it's not like i've made out any spreadsheets on this, just general impression from receipts.)\n\nYeah, it's often messy and crowded, but so fucking what?   Copps is too clean and quiet for my taste.  I like to be able to shout down the lane to ma baby so we can get our shop on.\n\nPlus, Woodman's actually has a pretty decent Latino foods section section.  And I love me some burritos.\n\nLiquor store is pretty frickin huge and the prices are good.  But it's not like we drink much here at casa de jujubee.  So whatever.  \n\nProduce selection is just as good as Copps.  I think the problem people have is that it looks messy, with all those big vats of tomatos.  The produce can be kind of dusty.  You know what you do with it?  YOU WASH IT BEFORE YOU EAT IT.  For god's sake...  Maybe I should drink more... ARGHHHHHHHH\n\nI hope the employees aren't being paid shit so I can have apples for 85 cents a lb.
