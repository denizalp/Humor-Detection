I have vague memories of this place, bittersweet. I arrived on a normal friday evening to grab a few drinks and a bite to eat. The food is pretty good, from what I remember anyways. \n\nI was with my gf at the time and my best bud, you guys know him simply as, PW, anyways some super drunk girl was on the prowl. She made her way, let me rephrase, she stumbled to each table that seemed suitable for her to flirt with whoever. The guy at the table next to us was with a beautiful woman, who stepped to use the ladies room, while away, this raging s*** walks up to him and flirts, he actually started flirting back (scumbag). Next she makes her way to my table and looks straight at me and starts flirting, it's so apparent I'm with my gf, why couldn't she hit on the single guy, furthermore, why hasn't my gf said anything by now?!!!\n\nShe was a badass P.R. girl and usually welcomed fights with open arms, I was shocked and jumped in and told her what I thought of her belligerent behavior. After spewing out more than a few profanities at her, she decided to throw a full glass of beer all over me. I was heated, instantly. \n\nThe look on her face was priceless, it was blackout mode for me though, I can imagine the snarl on my grill, lol. I stood up and with lack of better judgement whipped my Heineken bottle in her direction and it busted in-between a very nice couple who were understanding of the situation. Everyone wanted her gone, she was a wreck!\n\nIn the end, our tab was on the house. Alls well that ends well.
