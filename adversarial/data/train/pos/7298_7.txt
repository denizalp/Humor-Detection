One of the BEST Steakhouse Experiences Ever!\n\nSeveral years ago, I had dined at Del Frisco and thought the food was mediocre and the steaks were overly seasoned. However, one of my friends had recently seen Del Frisco featured on a TV show and wanted to eat here for her birthday. Let's just say, the second time around was definitely a charm. This time, the food and service was outstanding which earns Del Frisco's 5 STARS!\n\nOn Saturday, 9.10.11, my friends and I came for an early dinner at 5:30 pm. We were promptly seated with reservations. \n\nF O O D\n*STEAK TARTARE ($16) - 4 STARS\nThe steak tartare was tender and smooth with a nice savoryness to it. Paired long with the garlic crostini, it was the perfect blend of garlicky crunch with savory softness from the tartar.\n\n*32 OZ. BONE-IN WAGYU RIBEYE ($90) - 4.5 STARS\nPerfectly seared to a medium rare with a warm pink center, the wagyu had a nice crust which sealed in all the juices. The first bite was sublime. Ribeye is already a fatty cut of meat and the increased marbling from the wagyu and the bone-in added an intense richness full of decadent beefy flavor. Each bite was sinfully good and a carniwhore's delight.\n\n*SPINACH SUPREME w\/ Bacon ($12) - 4 STARS\nTalk about kicking up creamed spinach a notch. Already rich and decadent, the bacon added a nice smoky flavor with an extra layer of savoryness.\n\n*CHATEAU POTATOES ($10) - 3.5 STARS\nLike chunky mash potatoes, the chateau potatoes were smooth yet had a nice bite to it. I liked the addition of the cayenne pepper which gave it a nice kick. \n\n*LOBSTER MAC 'N CHEESE ($16) - 3 STARS\nThough the macaroni was perfectly cooked to an al-dente, I felt the b√©chamel sauce was lacking that ooeey gooey cheesiness and no lobster was really detected. \n\nS E R V I C E\nABSOULTELY IMPECCABLE! From the moment we walked in, we were greeted warmly and whisked away to our table. A card signed by the staff was brought to the birthday girl; what a nice touch! Our waitress Kelsey was AWESOME! She was very friendly, down-to-earth, knowledgeable and attentive without being intrusive.\n\nFood service was timed very well. As soon as we received our steaks, we were asked to cut into it to make sure it was cooked to our liking which it was. All the sides were served by the staff upon getting our entrees. \n\nThey even brought out a complimentary slice of their famous lemon cake for the birthday girl.\n\nThough the food at Del Frisco is about 4 STARS, the service is everything you would expect from a restaurant of this caliber, so I must reward them with an extra star.\n\nA M B I A N C E \/ D E C O R\nClassic steakhouse feel with crisp white linens, dark wood furnishings, hardwood floors, and dim lighting. Del Frisco is the perfect place for a romantic date or a large party as they have several private dining areas. \n\nThe restroom reminded me of a restroom at a club complete with a bathroom attendant, mints, gum and various lotions. \n\nSan Francisco has no shortage of steakhouses but can rarely live up to the ones I've tried in Vegas. Del Frisco is unequivocally no exception.
