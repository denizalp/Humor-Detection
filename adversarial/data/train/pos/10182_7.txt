So far, so good!  I unintentionally sat on my Maui Jim sunglasses after they fell behind my head while lounging on a cruise ship in the Caribbean, and within a day both sides fell off.  So, when I returned to Nevada, my optometrist referred me to Frame Fixer after it was determined that any repair was beyond that shop's capability.  And thus far Frame Fixer has come through.  My only gripe is that I made a 1-1\/2 hour round trip for nothing before having to return the next day to retrieve my repaired frames.  A sign in the window said the store was closed for 4 days while the proprietor is attending a wedding.  Next time I will call ahead to make sure a dropped off frame is ready for pick up, and the establishment is open.\n\nI am now en route to Spain via the Atlantic Ocean on another cruise ship, and so far my repaired sunglasses frames (with new hinges) have held up nicely.  If this proves true for the whole trip and beyond, I will likely raise this rating to five stars.  Time will tell!
