Discount Tire is the ONLY place to purchase and service tires. Could you save ten bucks at Costco? Maybe- but you will not beat the service at Discount Tire. SInce I got my first cars years and years ago, I knew to go to Discount, since that is where my family took our cars.\n\nI went to this location to have my tires rotated. Something I learned a few years ago is that you can call and make appointments at Discount Tire, so I called the day before and made an appointment- which speeds things up and gets you out faster.\n\nThis location was recently remodeled and it looks great. Comfy soft chairs, bottled water and candy to snack on, it's very nice. As with the other employees, they are amazing and work SO hard. Discount Tire has a customer for life, and I really appreciate the great customer service, especially when I am receiving a free tire rotation.\n\nWell done Discount Tire, you're doing it right.
