Cosmo totally delivered. Our room was spotless and loaded with nice furniture, but the real highlight was the balcony. We had a glam view of the Bellagio fountains and the Paris eiffel tower which was amazing for the insta pics...I had a vision and it was everything I wanted it to be lol! \n\nWe ordered more towels, blankets, toothbrushes, and slippers and they were brought to us in no time. \n\nThe complimentary lotion is so divine. It left my skin feeling soo smooth and silky--a must have in the dry Vegas winter weather! It all just felt so bougie..I loved it. \n\nOne issue I had was the water wasn't very warm when I showered the first night. It was fine the rest of our stay but during that period the water was only lukewarm at most. Also wished the lighting would be a little brighter in the bathrooms and hallways where the mirrors are. I found it hard to do my makeup because it was all so dimly lit and poor selfie lighting.\n\nOther than that, our stay here was delightful. We got a great deal with the Anniversary Suite sale, so we got our 2nd night's stay for $5--huge steal! So far I had a better experience here than Vdara (except for the lighting situation) and I definitely look forward to staying here again.
