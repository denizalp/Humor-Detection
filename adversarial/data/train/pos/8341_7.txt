I hit a pothole and bent an alloy wheel. Found this place on the Internet, emailed them. The owner, Brad Benson, emailed me back at 10:27 pm, Tuesday, September 25, 2012, \"Hi$125 to repair, you can meet my tech at 6318 w sahara on wed from 9-2, behind the goodwill store parking lot..thanks\" So the next morning, Wednesday the 26th, I take my wife to work, take the wheel and tire off the car and drive the 13 miles (one way) to the location arriving at about 9:10 am. I can see their van or trailer in the self-storage lot  but the lot is locked, no one's in the office and no one is around the van. I called their number at 9:24 am and left a message for Mr. Benson. I waited until 9:50 am and then left. Never did get a return phone call from anyone. At 12:09 pm I received this email from Mr. Benson, \"Sorry was on a flight to mn. Just landed. Will find out why he wasn't there.\"\n\nGreat way to run a business. So I spent over an hour chasing my tail, waiting for Godot, and used about a gallon of gas all for nothing. In my experience there are far too many flakes posing as business people in Las Vegas. You'd think that with the economy so bad they'd be providing some semblance of customer service. Mind you this service wasn't cheap, cheaper than buying a new rim but not cheap. I ended up driving to Henderson where I was charged $110 to have the wheel straightened by a shop with a brick and mortar establishment. I'll post a review of that business soon.
