Vegans and non-vegans alike can rejoice in this brightly-decorated cafe and order pretty much anything off the menu with the assurance that it will be a mouth-watering endeavor. \n\nWe ordered the vegetarian chili with cornbread, Santa Fe salad, and the \"fish\" fry special which comes with a side of your choice. Though the fish fry was excellent, my favorite of the three was the Santa Fe salad - it came perfectly dressed in a savory cilantro lime dressing, with generous slices of avocado. The chili was surprisingly flavorful. In all cases, there was a great attention to spices; it's one of the reason why I like vegan\/vegetarian cafes since they seem to have this in common. \n\nThe wait staff is fully knowledgable about the food. I asked if there was flour in the \"fish\" fry breading and I got a run down of the ingredients in both the vegan and vegetarian options - indicating the staff is fully prepared to engage in and anticipate any specific dietary needs. \n\nDessert was a slice of vegan-friendly mango cheesecake. There were splashes of ginger, lime, and mint. It tastes just like cheesecake, minus the heavy feeling of swallowing a brick of butter and cream cheese. \n\nCoffee is excellent, it comes in an individual serving-size french press.
