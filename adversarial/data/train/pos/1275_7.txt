I called this office to inquire about the services they had available for teeth whitening. Needless to say I made a decision to not use them nor will I ever consider using them for any other services. \nThe girl who answered the phone was completely rude and each question I asked she gave me answers as though I was asking a stupid question. I was calling to find out the difference between the different styles of whitening-pros and cons and she basically laughed at me over the phone.\nI can't believe that Doctor would have someone so rude working for them-waste of money because I will never consider going there after being treated that way over the phone. The front desk staff in any office are integral to the entire patient experience and this was an epic fail.
