Gotta bump it down a star...\n\nI wanted Shave Ice the past Sunday because I have been craving for it ever since we left Maui some days ago.  However, Purple penguin did not satisfy me one bit.\n\nFirst, they gave me the wrong flavor.  I asked for Tiger's blood, leche, and mango.  The order taker wrote down TB\/LE\/MA.\n\nWhen I got my cup of ice, it became Tiger's blood, pink lemonade, and mango.  So, we had to wait for them to redo it.  Was it worth it...Heck No!\n\nIt's as if they had preshaved the ice and just scoop it into a cup as it is ordered.  There were chunks of ice.\n\nNo bueno.  Not returning, ever again.  Why?  There are much better shave ice shacks out here in my area.  Just had Beach Bums today and is more of the Hawaiian shave ice consistency that I was looking for.
