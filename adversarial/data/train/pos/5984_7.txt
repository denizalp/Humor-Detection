Had meatballs on top of polenta...was quite good.\n\nWalnut gnocchi... is dry and scratches your throat, making you worry you are going to choke to death.  After the taste kicks in, you start to wish you had choked to death.\n\nHad an arugula salad, which was just a mountain of arugula with dressing on it.  It tasted fine, but not really a culinary stretch to put that together.  \n\nHad another item, I think it was a Special.... but I would suggest that's a misnomer.  \n\nThe decor is like every cliche in contemporary dining thrown into one space, and the service ranged from snooty (owner) to deer-in-the-headlights (server).   There are a dozen good restaurants along this little strip of Queen East, no reason at all to visit here.
