This place is a nice neighbourhood spot.  \n\nUpsides: great latte, served in a huge glass (didn't burn my hand), my first time ever having a rosemary walknut muffin, super friendly staff, sitting at the bar, facing High Park and reading a book or doing a crossword puzzle . It seems like the kind of place people from the neighbourhood come to hang out. In fact, around noon on a Saturday it was packed with families and young kids, spread out in the spacious seating area.  A nice big communal table is great for groups. \n\nDownsides: can i complain it was too sunny when I pulled out my laptop, or is that just being fussy. Other downsides - internet was intermittent, and, as Michelle A. warned, it is pretty away from the sunny window.  \n\nWould come back if I lived in the area!
