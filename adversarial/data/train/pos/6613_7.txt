OMG, are their ANY competent fast food places anymore? Two customers in the restaurant around 3pm'ish and THREE people behind the front counter with 4 more in the back kitchen area. No lie, it took these guys almost 9 minutes to put 10 pcs of chicken in a bucket and hand it to me! With my to-go order, no condiments, utensils, plates, napkins...nothing. And they want to raise the minimum wage??? Really?
