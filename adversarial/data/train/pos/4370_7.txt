What cool little spot.\n\nI don't usually leave the casino much when im out here because i only come to Vegas for work, but I had some friends in town so we went out to eat.\n\nThe building is nothing fancy, actually pretty plain inside, but it was a nice spot to enjoy catching up with old friends.  It was very quiet inside event though there were a handful of tables with people eating (maybe thats a sign of good food??)\n\nthe service was amazing.  I was pretty thirsty so i was downing the water in the smaller sized cup they give you and it never was empty.  The servers were there constantly to take care of any needs, but they werent overly attentive and only seemed to show up when we needed something.\n\nI didn't get anything crazy and just had the garlic chicken tonight, but it was great.  I have heard of levels of heat, but she only asked us none, med, or hot.  I chose medium thinking of what people have told me of \"thai hot\" but the medium was actually very mild.\n\nnice place, decent prices, awesome service.  very good experience.
