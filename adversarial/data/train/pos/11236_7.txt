Demetrius is the only good thing this place has going for it. He is helpful, and kind. Good luck accomplishing anything else here other than wasting your money. \n*The units are completely over priced for what you're getting. \n*You get one parking spot PER unit & its so small you can barely even get out of your car after you've parked. \n*The gym is tiny, outdated and has little equipment, always packed in the evenings. \n*Even though you're already over paying for your unit maintenance\/ work orders never get completed accordingly: for example,\n*My AC has broke probably atleast 8 times since i moved in, & the maintenance men told me \"it's old & probably needs to be replaced, but we're gonna try and make it work for right now\"\n*the new property manager Ashley is the worst part about it all, she is sexist, rude, & just really annoying\n\nDont waste your time or money
