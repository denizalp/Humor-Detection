The pizza here is different.  Not uncommon, but not the pizza you think of such as papa johns,  i.e., heavier on toppings and cheese.  In short, it's a great example of a neapolitan style pizza.  \n\nThe keys to me are the dough which is excellent (5\/5), the fresh toppings, and the quick cook time of 90 seconds.  They use buffalos milk mozzarella  and marzano tomatoes which were amazingly good (5\/5).\n\nWe went with the Raffaele, which has sweet peppers (which have a kick), and roasted onions.  We ordered the large and im kind of embarrassed to say my wife and I finished it all...it was that good (5\/5).  \n\nSet up inside the restuarant is simple and there us ample bench style seating (5\/5).  Just and excellent example of this style pizza that I highly recommend.
