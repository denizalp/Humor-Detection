Oh 24 Hour Fitness on Rainbow and Cheyenne\nHow can I express how wonderfully you are?\nI guess it must be in the fashion of Bards lost in yonder.\nYou always serve me well when I visit in the late evening.\nThough I did catch you serving a whole parking lot once.\nI believe it was in the early evening during the 5 to 6 hour.\nBut I cannot be upset for too long,\nAs I always have you almost to myself during my normal 9 to 11pm visits.\nYou always have plenty of room for me to wonder\nand plenty of equipment for me to enjoy.\nI can visit, get my fitness fix and be on my merry way.\nAlmost never once did another interrupt my stay.\nThough I do wonder if you ever clean up after yourself.\nWeights may be in disarray but there is plenty to be found here or there.\nNo pool or basketball court for me to enjoy\nBut plenty of free weights to be employed.\nFor me, when a quick workout I need, it must be thee.
