What an awesome outdoor adult playground.  Spacious and lots of places to sit down at and have a drink.  \n\nCame here a few times and the outdoor games were fun.  Jenga, Beer Pong (with trash cans) and a pool table but with bowling balls.  \n\nWhenever I'm in town and hanging out with a lot of friends, this is the place to go.  Unfortunately, one visit a group of 15 of us were denied access because 2 of our guys had football jersey's so men make sure you do not wear sports attire.
