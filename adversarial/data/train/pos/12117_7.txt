Stayed here for the duration I was here with my boyfriend. We got a decent deal on Hotwire (we were staying during a crowded week so everything was pretty pricey).\n\nThe rooms were decent. We got decent views. Decent experience. That's it. Decent. Nothing out of the ordinary.\n\nI normally stay with my family at Bellagio but I was with my boyfriend and I opted for Caesar's. Sorry, but I will be continuing my stay elsewhere from now, Caesars. We mainly stayed here for the novelty and the location (center strip).I wouldn't mind spending extra for a better.\n\nGambling was slightly annoying. We played slots, roulettes, and blackjack. I don't know about you but I am suspicious of their systems. We only played blackjack four times, and all in a row. Of those four times, I got 20 twice. Dealer beat me every time. Why? He got 21 three times. That's freakin' bull. Roulette was decent (machine version). However lost 3 in a row because I bet on black (after 4 reds first) and got 7 reds in a row. When I decided to not bet on black was when the ball ended up in a black number immediately (spin #8).
