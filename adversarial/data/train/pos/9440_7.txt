The food at Zinc Bistro is absolutely fantastic! I went yesterday for the first time and had the curry chicken sandwich and bites of my family members meals. Everything was great. \n\nThe reason I'm giving Zinc Bistro three stars instead of five is  because the service was horrendous. After looking around, it seemed that it just might have been our waitress as the people around us didn't seem to be getting great service either. \n\nEverything was fine until our food arrived. When it did, I asked for another glass of water and my sister asked for some french fries. Neither came until the end of our meal. We would have asked again, but our waitress didn't come see if we needed anything and it seemed nearly impossible to flag her down. When the fries and water finally came, the waitress put the rim of the pitcher right onto the middle of the glass where my mouth had been! She continued to do this for the rest of my family! This pitcher serves the entire restaurant, it was definitely unsanitary. \n\nHowever, I again stress that it just seemed to be our particular waitress.
