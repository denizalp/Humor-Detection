Typically, QUA has been very good in service and everything else they offer.\n\nHowever, during my last visit (the week of CES).  With the CES going on, the spa was completely empty, you had the choice of massage time in 30 minute increment for the whole day.  I couldn't believe how slow it was.\n\nFor the apast 5 to 6 years on my visit to Caesars, I've always received a back-to-back classical massage.  For whatever the reason, they seems to have discontinued this service starting 2012.  Considering, how empty the spa was, they might make an exception.  Most business will make an exception on a slow days.   They rather keep it busy than leaving it empty.  So, I had requested to speak to a manger.  However, this rude, cocky man name Toby responded saying \"I AM THE SUPERVISOR AND I SAID NO TO YOUR REQUEST.  I AM THE SUPERVISOR AND WHAT I SAY GOES\"  basically yelling at me telling me how important he was and he has the final say.  I requested that I still wanted to speak to a manger.  He yelled back at me stating \"SHE'S BUSY.  SHE DOESN'T HAVE THE TIME TO SPEAK WITH YOU.  I HAVE THE FULL AUTHORITY AND ANSWER IS NO\"\n\nI never did get to speak with a manager to provide a feedback to this rude SOB they have for a supervisor.  I also did not get a massage at QUA during the trip.  Instead, I receved an awsome massage at Canyon Ranch Spa at The Venetian.  They were perfect to the last detail.  \n\nI still like QUA since I actually like Caesars Palace.  However, QUA Spa needs to look elsewhere to hire a better person to man the front desk at the QUA.  With the like like Toby claming to everybody that he is the supervisor  and telling everybody that he rather like to keep the place empty than providing a service...  well good luck to them.  This little bald headed toad  must have kissed all his boss's behind to still be a supervisor.
