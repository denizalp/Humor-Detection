I can see Biscuits becoming a mid-day go-to for late breakfast and lunch.  I've stopped in a few times, also gotten takeout, and I can see why it's starting to build a following.  Solid+ down home food, A+ service\n\nI'll mention this right up early . . . their Portuguese sausage is excellent, and cooked just the way I like it.  Sliced and crisped all over.  Yeah, I wiped a few napkins full of grease off them, but they were a great side.  DEFINITELY will be back for those.  Seriously, who else is doing Portuguese sausage in AZ?\n\nNext, their meatloaf with mushroom red wine gravy is great.  Strange to me, it comes with mashed covered in white gravy?  Huh?  The next time I order the meatloaf, and I certainly will again, the white gravy is getting 86'd.  \n\nThree times I've had the Denver omelet, and it's always been solid.  Not great, kinda skimpy on the green peppers and ham, but well made.\n\nThe hash browns are standard, which makes their corned beef hash a bit of a disappointment.  I'm by no means an expert on corned beef hash, but I wanted crispy hash browns mixed with corned beef, and both came out kinda soggy.\n\nTheir biscuits . . . I believe they mix in some grits . . . are definitely gut bombs.  Perfect for a hungover morning.\n\nIf you're eating in, and order pop, they bring you your pop in a big glass and leave an extra carafe of it at the table.  Nice.  Wasteful sometimes, but nice.\n\nOverall, Biscuits is a great addition to the Ahwatukee neighborhood
