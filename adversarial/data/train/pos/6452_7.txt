Idea is fun. I think most people there were first time visitors since this place has received lots of attn via BlogTO, Groupon, etc, etc. \n\nA group of about 5 of us went Saturday afternoon soon after they opened (1:30) and already almost all the tables were full. There seems to be no order in which to get a table if things are full...so it's grab what you can. Could be really annoying if someone swoops in and steals a seat from you.\n\nYou pay $5 to get in. OK. Then there is a sign that says \"No in and out privileges\" .... basically if you're there for a few hours and you get hungry or thirsty you buy from them. I get that. But what I don't get...is with this rule asking us not to order anything because they were busy- we're goddamn hungry. \n\nWell couldn't I just run down the street to Pizza Pizza and be done with it? Not unless you want to pay that $5 again. So be sneaky when you run to Pizza Pizza like I was. The sandwiches in there looked...not good. \n\nThere was a customer who came up to the cash when I walked in and was like:\n\n\"Hi, um, excuse me...we actually ordered a chai latte\"\n\"Well I wrote down latte\"\n\"Well...we asked for a chai latte?\"\n\"Well...my paper doesn't say that? So...what do you want me to do? Make another....UGHHH OK I guess I can just give me a minute OK? I'm really busy\"\n\nIt was bad to treat a dude like that...even worse to do it in front of a big group of people who just walked in. Anyways, they've got lots of boardgames which is fun. But the some of the staff need some serious lessons in how to run a business. \n\nBoy, was that Pizza Pizza good.
