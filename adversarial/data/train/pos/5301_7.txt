Met some friends there last week and was very disappointed.  I've been here before, wasn't that impressed either.  It wasn't busy and took 45 minutes for wings and french fries, and it was not busy!  Of course it was cold and the wings were soggy, gross :( \nAlso, beer used to be cheap, what happened?
