Not bad at all. I remember walking past this all the time in north york, never realizing it was one of the biggest bubbletea chains ever. Now that it's come to markham, and the january promo is $3.50 drinks, how can I say no?\n\nThe two drinks on promo right now are not disgusting ones that nobody wants, like how most bubble tea places put on their promo. *Achem* chatime and their tea of the months... Matcha milk tea with red bean and 2 ladies (how laughable was it that we asked for \"two 2 ladies please\") \n\nUpon walking in, it was delightfully empty but a pretty large seating area for a bubble tea shop, which was great. The order process was quick and the drinks did not take too long although it's weird how they don't really call out #'s consistently. I was so confused because there were 3-4 drinks there, but they were unclaimed because no # was called. It's okay, they have time to get it together. *new store forgiveness* \n\nMilk tea was a lot more creamy than any other place and quality was pretty good, even though it didn't blow me out of the water. The thing is, I hate this plaza and all the ratchets that can't drive or park here.. that is probably going to be the biggest thing stopping me from coming here.
