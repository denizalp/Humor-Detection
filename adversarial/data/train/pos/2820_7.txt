There food is absolutely delicious. Amazing bread. The food is 5 stars, but I'm writing this review because of their service. \n\nMy boyfriend and I were grocery shopping one evening and decided we wanted to get a loaf of Great Harvest bread instead of a loaf from the grocery store. We walked in and were not greeted at all. Not even a hello. We were the only customers in there so there really is no excuse. We eventually decided on a bread from the rack and approached the register. Still, no physical words left the employees mouth. I saw that there was a loaf of bread on their free samples cutting board and expected to get offered a slice. Never happened. But, what really irritated me was my boyfriend specifically asked, \"Oh, that looks really good ! What kind of bread is that ?\" The employee told us it was coconut. My boyfriend then proceeded to say, \"Oh that must be amazing, I love coconut!\" .... STILL DIDN'T OFFER US A SAMPLE !!! We will not be returning to this location. I will drive to the other side of town before I step back into this location. \n\n(btw, all the other locations I have been to go out of their way to greet you and offer you a sample before you even make it to the counter)
