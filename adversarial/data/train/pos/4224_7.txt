All I can say is don't think you're going to pop in and out because all you need is an onion.  And don't bother coming unless you just got paid.  Because if you're anything like me, that onion will cost you about $80 by the time you leave.\n\nBecause AJ's is so pricey, you won't see my buying paper towels and cat litter here.  But you will find an assortment of cheeses, pastries, or whatever else I can't live without in my basket.  Their meat department is far superior to any supermarket I've been in.  And the produce always looks picture perfect.\n\nThe staff is always exceptionally friendly and helpful.  Unfortunately, I can't say the same for many of the snotty patrons you may encounter.  Don't let that deter you from the experience.  And, oh yea, don't forget the onion.
