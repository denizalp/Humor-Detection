This company just ignores me.\n\n I was about to replace the air conditioner and asked them to estimate the cost last week. They came to my home to check it out.They promised me that they will call me back later with exact cost.  However, so far, they never give me a call at all. Just ignored.\n\nToday, I replaced my air conditioner with another company.\n\nDo not trust this company.\nThis company does not work ON time.
