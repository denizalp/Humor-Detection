This is a really cool airport, partially because it's Vegas and partially because of the sandwich shop. On the other hand...\n\nWhen I went through security, a TSA guy in his mid-20's told me I didn't pass the security check and asked me if I wanted the pat down there or in a private room. Well, jeez, dude, since I don't find you pretty, let's go with right here. \n\nDespite being in full view of everyone, this dude grabbed me everywhere. I'm not exaggerating. I said, \"What are you doing?\"\n\n\"I'm just doing my job, man.\"\n\nI guess grabbing someone's package is doing your job. You know, because of all the weapons I might be hiding there. So, TSA Dude, I'm not a confrontational guy at all. I try to be cool to everyone, but I would be confrontational if I saw you in public. Just sayin'. \n\nOtherwise, great airport. :)
