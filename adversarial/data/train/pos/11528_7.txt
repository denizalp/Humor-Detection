I literally ate here so much that my boyfriend made me stop going. That is how much I love their veggie sandwiches and I have been SO over Subway since 1994. Subway just never had much to offer me in the way of a cheese sandwich because:  gross!\n\nI basically expected their veggie to be a huge gigantic letdown in that way you do when you are a vegetarian and have to order the \"obligatory veg\" meal at a place that your meat eater friends eat. \n\nNot only was my mouth surprised by the OMG yummy, but Jimmy John's sandwiches are filling in a way that Subway is not for a vegetarian. Maybe its because they put more than one slice of cheese on it, maybe its because they spread awesome avocado sauce all over it and don't charge extra. Who knows, who cares. All you need to know is NOM NOM Down the hatch!!!\n\nAs for this particular location, they started to know me and know my order. Call me old fashioned, but I like that! The service is almost always great and my food is consistently yummy. What more could I really ask for besides a Jimmy John's closer to where I live?
