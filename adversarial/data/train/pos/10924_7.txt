Decided to pop in here for a little snack before dinner since had a really light breakfast. This location is new for me but was incredibly impressed with the super customer service and attitudes of the employees. They had a huge party when we arrived and the employees behind the counter handled it flawlessly. They are very upbeat and vibrant which is refreshing in this months day.\n\nI went with kids meals for the children and a small side order of beef and broccoli for me. The side that I ordered for the kids meal was orange chicken which looked good in the bowl they served it out of and on the fork too. It was very good and fresh as well. The beef and broccoli was fresh and beautifully cooked. The broccoli was just right and steamed to perfection. I am going to make this my new panda local since it is so close to me.
