They attract customers by sending out fake prize notices and using other misleading, unethical and trickery type tactics. You will get an envelope that looks very official from the \"Office of Records and Disbursements Division\"  and the \"National Correspondences Official Records\" - yeah right...\n\nSure enough, its just an ad from the scammers at this dealership trying to trick you into going down to the dealership. I don't know if this is even legal, but it surely is unethical.. they should be ashamed of themselves. Is this really what they have to resort to  in order to drum up business? This alone should tell you what they truly have to offer... nothing.
