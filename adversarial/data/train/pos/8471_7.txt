The name for this small Korean restaurant is problematic. Similar to the Pojangmatcha Restaurant (http:\/\/www.yelp.ca\/biz\/pojangmacha-restaurant-north-york) that only has \"North York Restaurant\" as any English lettering and you have to be able to read Korean to divine it's actual name, Roll dot com appears to be a \"oh that's so Korean\" attempt at translating the restaurant's actual name. The Korean characters reveal this place is called Kimbap Dot Com. Curiously, neither Roll dot com nor Kimbap dot com is this restaurant's actual web address. I would imagine if you owned roll dot com you would have long ago sold it to Toyota and retired to Belize. In either translation, the web address like name is actually just its name. It's like calling a restaurant Amazon dot com and throwing up your hands in surprise and disbelief when someone comments your restaurant name also happens to be the name of an actual web site.\n\n\"You're saying they sell books? Not ddukbokki? Hmmm. Who knew?\"\n\nAnyway, kimbap is a rice roll, sometimes confused with a California roll. But it's a wholly Korean dish. Kimbap usually features daikon radish and some ham. Either name for this place betrays what it sells, although I'm not sure why they couldn't have just called the place Kimbap Dot Com in English characters. My friend Joe, a Korean food critic (http:\/\/www.zenkimchi.com), is eternally frustrated by the seeming insecurity Korean restaurateurs have with just presenting their food under their actual Korean names. Whitey doesn't run screaming into the hills because it's called tapas or dim sum or carne asada. We just absorb those terms into our language. We'll deal with kimbap too. You don't have to convince us it's a \"roll\".  In some cases, like soon dae or jokbal, Koreans might want to just keep those names period.\n\nOkay, that long winded rant over, I gotta give kimbap dot com roll dot com good marks. I got the chamchi kimbap and it was just as good as any kimbap I've had back in the Motherland. Chamchi kimbap is a tuna roll. But one should understand this is not raw tuna. It's canned tuna. And that's okay. Kimbap is not meant to be high culture cuisine but a quick, cheap, and ready roll you take to a picnic or on a bus trip to the coast. It's like whipping up a tuna pasta salad and then wrapping it in rice and then wrapping it in seaweed. I'd imagine people who confuse kimbap for sushi might be freaked out. But whatever. \n\nPrices are higher here in Canada. You can get a kimbap in the Motherland for about $3. Here it runs a few pennies over $5 with tax. Although you get a nice cup of soup with it. In the Motherland you normally get just a baggie of pickled radishes which I normally chuck out.\n\nThey do pack the kimbap in a Styrofoam carton. Usually in the Motherland you get it rolled up in some tinfoil. I kind of like the tinfoil as it makes it way more portable.\n\nDespite the name, the place serves a very extensive selection of Korean foods, including ddukbokki, stir-fried rice, dumplings, and kimchi chijae. Nothing much is over $7.\n\nService was quick, polite, and easily conducted in the barbarian tongue.
