Update: Shaliza is no longer working here and I cannot vouch for quality of work for the rest of the stylists so I have to downgrade my rating).  Shaliza can now be found in Skribbles on Kensington Rd.  \n\nShaliza (not sure how to spell it but it's pron. Sha Lisa) is amazing.  I'm pretty fussy about my hair to the point I've been to 5 different hair salons in the last year trying to find the right person\/salon and I'm happy to say I've found it.  KT is in a lovely old house that's been throughly modernised inside.  It's got the coolest toilet in Calgary (seriously it's got a heated seat mode..lol) but I digress back to the hair, I've never been unhappy with my cut there, Shaliza does a fantastic job.
