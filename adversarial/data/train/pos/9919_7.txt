My first review in Vegas!  I'm starting to feel all hot n juicy on the inside!! (haha kidding of course)\nThis is definitely a place to come by if you want to hang out with some friends and family, a very very casual place to eat.  As you know, it's going to get messy.  It was my first time in a place like this, and even me, who's a guy that likes to try new things, I still had to wear gloves when I was eating all the food.  You can choose to not wear gloves, but your hands will stink (especially if you order it hot and juicy, which is all the sauces mixed into one)\n\nEven on a wed night, there was about a 30 minute wait.  The waitstaff is all really cool.  Atmosphere is relaxed.  But eating the food is not as relaxing as the rest of the place.  We were sweating, the food can be very spicy if you want it to be, be careful!  I wouldn't come here on a first date either.  Ripping off shrimp heads awkwardly wearing gloves (or not) may be too much to handle for some people.  \n\nI would def come back, it's great place to have a bunch of food and get your seafood craving satisfied.
