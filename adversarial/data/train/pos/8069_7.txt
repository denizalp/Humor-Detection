First of all, I'm a major Gardein fangirl, so when my omnivore family wanted to go to a pub that had an entire Gardein section in its menu I was all in.\n\nThey have a Gardein burger and sliders (omit the cheese and special sauce), which comes with fries. They also have Gardein \"wings\" in a variety of different flavors. The sliders & wings are on the Happy Hour menu, so from 3p-6p, M-F, they are nearly 1\/2 off.\n\nThey have pasta options as well but I've never tried those. They've also added more veggie appetizers, like a cauliflower dish & a Brussels Sprouts & Potato dish. I don't know what sauces these are cooked with (haven't tried them) so make sure you inquire with the chef or manager (not the waiter) before ordering.\n\nFood was fresh, yummy, and nicely presented. We had good table service. It was perfect for a pre-concert dinner. (Gila River Arena is only @ 100 feet away.)\n\nIf you're shopping or headed to a concert in this Westgate area, there aren't many options for vegans. Yard House is a solid choice, particularly when dining with omnivores.
