This place is right near my school. No luck for my waistline. For the love of all that is good and holy, please try the cupcakes. They are so much better than hipster pastries. Their nanaimo bars also make you want to sing songs about the raw, natural beauty of British Columbia. Anything you order here will be served with a nice dose of Ukrainian attitude. The women in here always look pissed when I ask for my order, like I'm inconveniencing them by ordering a pastry. That said, I'd rather receive attitude from a 40 year old Ukrainian baker than some snotty little hipster barista.
