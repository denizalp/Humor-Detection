I thought it might be too good to be true, this great-looking restaurant\/pub, but after three visits I must say I love everything about it.\n\nAYCE jumbo wings for $12? Amazing. And good sauces, too. My favorites being Bourbon Chipotle and a custom mix of Bourbon Chipotle with Suicide (just ask for it). Heat and sweet can't be beat!\n\nNice big HDTVs, fun high-top bar seating as well as booths with a scoping view of the corner of Harmon Avenue and Paradise Road. \n\nDiverse clientele, an interesting mix of out-of-towners and locals. Cool vibe, and pleasant staff. Wish this place were in my neighborhood!
