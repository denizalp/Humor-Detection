I've come here twice and hated it both times. Everything about this is artificial with not a single real flavor or color. Diabetes in a cup. The staff was nice. Seems like a lot of high school students work here. They do a good job. Whoever makes the Sirup needs a career change or is being bribed by a pharmaceutical company.
