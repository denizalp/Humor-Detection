Ordered a few rolls ( a California roll and a Mexican roll) through door dash. I payed extra to add cucumber to the Mexican roll. I received both rolls both without cucumber. The California roll automatically comes with cucumber and that was left out as well. Also the wasabi wasn't separated and it was scooped and dumped over a portion of the rolls. \nWhen I called and spoke to a manager he began to argue with me saying the chef didn't do any of this. He had me send him photos and he couldn't have cared less. There are WAY too many good sushi options in town. Stay away from this place. They truly need to learn some customer service and how to make a roll.\n\nNot to mention it all falls apart because it's so loosely rolled.\n\nFAST FORWARD a few hours- I am gluten free and come to find out they add fillers to all their fish, which contain gluten. I became violently I'll for hours. Awful awful place. I rarely give 1 star reviews but I'd give them a -100 if I could.
