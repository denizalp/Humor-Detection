It's all about the hustle with these furniture places because it's all about who can try to get you to pay more for what the furniture actually is worth. I came with a friend this past weekend to try and help her look for furniture so this place was one of the ones that we got to visit and eh it was okay I mean honestly nothing in here peaked my interest and nor did it for her. Like I just believe in you get what you pay for and the quality of furniture is under the expectations of what I actually would even consider to furnish my home with. I'm a Crate & Barrel kind of guy but to each is own. The whole finance options that they offer are a bit ridiculous like for example they only offered my friend 6 months and across the street she could get 12 months and then it's suppose to be same as cash and all this other jazz I don't know, I stay away from these little places...
