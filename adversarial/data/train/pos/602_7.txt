Heads up! You need to love match to enjoy this place. They have nothing nonmatcha. Hence the name.  \n\nHad match soft serve. It was pretty good, not super sweet. Not the biggest match lover so im probably not the best person to ask about the flavor. \n\n4 stars bc the place is cute and the service was great too.
