Las Vegas' newest addition to the elite club scene delivers on all fronts. \n\nJewel is a smaller, classier joint that can probably be best described as Hakkasan Group and SLS had a secret love child, and came out looking like a female Justin Bieber with Kardashian boobs- it looks familiar, but cuter, hotter, and probably will be picked by MTV for a few reality show seasons.\n\nStandard Vegas club rules apply here, so if you want to come and have a good time, you better have a relationship with a host, and guys, you know that the better you look after him or her, the better he or she will look after you (shoot me a note if you really need help). Girls, you always have the advantage in Vegas, so maintain standard protocol, and everyone has a good time. \n\nOne thing you have to watch is the amazing light setup on the back wall behind the DJ. It's a step above anything here I've seen, and even all my host friends were blown away.
