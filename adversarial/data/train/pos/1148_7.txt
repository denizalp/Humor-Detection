Terrible service\n\nDespite the good coffee and great location, this Dunkin Donuts has always been understaffed and dirty. The floors and tables are usually  covered with crumbs and the doors and windows are smeared with handprints and food.\n\n Over the past few months it's been getting worse, and the only reason I go there is because it is convenient and close to home. \n\nI understand the later you go in the day the less of a variety of donuts you  will have to choose from. However, the donuts you do select should be fresh, not stale,  not squished or look a mess.\n\nIf you're looking for a Dunkin Donuts I would avoud this location.
