Umm there's nothing \"bundt\" praises here! I have always been a happy customer when ordering bundt cakes. I've been here plenty of times as well as ordering them minis to be sent to my corporate office in California and they love them their too. \n\nI was actually introduce to these cakes sent from heaven about 8 years ago when I first moved here to Las Vegas and immediately feel in love with them. How can anyone not love the ultra moist cakes and the Devine perfectly sweeten cream cheese frosting. \n\nThe Sahara location is my go to. I've order these for birthdays (lots of birthdays) as gifts and just to take to a potluck or party and have always be given kiddos for being the guy with the best dessert. The store is pretty big the customer service is always friendly and of coarse did I mention how their cakes and frosting is to die for!!! \n\nAnyhow the store itself had other gifts and trinkets to offer but I stick to what I know and that is the amazing chocolate chips red velvet with tons of frosting. The price is really bit that bad either especially when you will be completely satisfy and when choose to have it decorated and wrapped nicely they look even that much more pretty. \n\nIn fact I am head home this fall and will be taking 2 cakes with me just cause I have ordered it for my cousin for her bday when she came to Vegas to celebrate and she has been craving them ever since. Note that you can also order online and have it shipped anywhere nation wide. How awesome it that, but I prefer to take it straight from the shop myself!!!! \n\nThis last last time I sent one to my wife for Vday this year and she was the envy of her office. Besides them doing a great job the girl that helped me last minute over the phone I think her name was Michelle was so amazing. Kiddos to her and nothing Bundt cake you guys always make me happy!
