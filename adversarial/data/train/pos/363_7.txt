Taste: The Kraken sauce was too salty for my liking. However, it was less oily than Captain's Boil's signature sauce. \n\nFreshness: The crayfish and shrimp were not fresh. They were the previously frozen ones. Previously frozen shrimps tend to be mushier, but still acceptable. However, previously frozen crayfish was just dry and tough, not recommended. My fave were the clams, which were very juicy. \n\nSides: I think there should be more options. Captains Boil offers lotus root and okra. I understand that the Boil Bar may want to distinguish itself from Captains Boil so it does not want to offer the same sides. Maybe the Boil Bar can offer potato slices or some other veggies as sides?\n\nCost: On par with Captains Boil. The 15% off really sweetened the deal. \n\nService: Very attentive. Much better than Captains Boil.
