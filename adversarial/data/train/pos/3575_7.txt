I've been to this place many times since it first opened. The food is excellent, they have a large menu with everything being very tasty. I haven't found another Wonton Soup that I like better than theirs in over 10 years. \n\nThe only setback is some of the staff. They have young children answer their phones, and most of the time these kids are down right rude. They are extremely short when you call to place an order, I understand that they may not speak English very well, but still. They could at least learn how to say please and thank you! I called to order dinner for my mom and me one evening and the kid who took our order over the phone told us we could not get a side of mixed vegetables for my mother. When I went in to pick up my food and talked to an older lady, she appologized and gave us the veggies without an arguement. \n\nOverall, their menu is awesome. You get a lot of food for your money and I won't stop coming in because it's my favorite chinese food in this area.I feel that they could improve with a bigger adult staff to answer phones and help check customers out. Other than that this place is enjoyable.
