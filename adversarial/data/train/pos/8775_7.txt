Wetlands Park is nothing short of amazing. I can't believe it took me nearly 13 years to finally check out this oasis in the desert. As an avid hiker, I almost always opt to head off trail and and explore areas nearby.\n\nIf you're looking for an oasis in the desert, look no further. This area plays an integral part of the water cycle for the Las Vegas Valley and has become a bird refuge for numerous waterfowl and migratory bird species. \n\nAn unfortunate reality of this wonderful jewel in the desert is that it's been subjected to continuous vandalism and overall disrespect. There is graffiti, trash, shell casings, etc. that truly bring the overall quality of the wetlands down. I didn't feel this was worth reducing the overall rating since it cannot be avoided, nor is it a reflection of the park itself. People just need to stop being so disrespectful. \n\nOn a side note, if you do decide to venture off trail, be very cautious of people shooting in the vicinity as they will NOT pay attention to your whereabouts. My husband was struck with a rogue bullet (thankfully it was a .40 being shot from quite a distance, and by a very bad shot might I add). The idiots responsible ran off as soon as we called out to them; they did not even wait to see if he was ok. FYI, shooting anywhere in the Las Vegas Valley is NOT permitted. Take it to BLM designated lands OUTSIDE of Vegas, people.
