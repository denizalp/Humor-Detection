I guess, after reading other reviews, that we were lucky we went for drinks and appetizers.\n\nWe had a very long break between the wedding ceremony and the reception, which was being held in the arcade.  This was convenient since the out of town guests were staying right here at the hotel.  So, in we went.  There were at least 20 in our group and we had no problem with service.  The nachos were yummy and most of the group had wine or beer.  No one ordered any fancy drinks, but you could smell them, and they did smell good.\n\nMaybe things have gotten better, maybe we got lucky, but we were able to relax before we all had to go get dressed to attend the reception.
