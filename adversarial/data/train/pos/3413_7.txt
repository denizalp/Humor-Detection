I came here for a work Christmas Party recently and I love the ambiance here. It kind of reminds of Honey Salt which is also in Summerlin.\n\nWhile I think it is on the pricy side I was there for a Christmas party so I didn't have to worry about paying :) \n\nThe service was very good. They came over several times throughout our meal and checked on us and made sure we were enjoying our experience. They also took our picture a couple of times when we asked which was nice of them.\n\nI have to say I enjoyed their appetizers and small bites more than my actual meal. I would love to come back and try more of them because they were hard to choose from because they all looked so good!\n\nWe decided to start off with the hummus, mac and cheese and the dates. I have to say the dates were my favorite out of all three. They were served with red sauce which was a great pairing. The mac and cheese was great for splitting since it was very heavy. The hummus was good but my least favorite.\n\nWe then also decided to order the deviled eggs. OMG they were probably the best denied eggs I have ever have and they looked so pretty when they were served.\n\nIf I came back I would have to order the dates and the eggs again.\n\nI then ordered the tomato basil soup. So good and creamy. It was also served with a tiny grilled cheese sandwich that was great for dipping. \n\nI ordered a pasta dish but I don't recall the name. By that time I was pretty full and probably didn't need to order this. I took it home for my uncle to try. \n\nI did, however, save room for dessert. We tried the Honey Olive Oil Cake and the Milk Chocolate Souffle. The souffle was just ok to me but I really enjoyed the olive oil cake. The olive oil made it very moist. It was served with blood orange sherbet. Which felt kind of odd as a pairing but still tasted good.\n\nI enjoyed the dining experience. I will be back to try more apps and dessert.
