Well I'm definitely happy I braved the snow for brunch at Hadley's!! Not like I had much choice with my fridge being empty and all, but you know...\n\nI've been eyeing Hadley's since I moved into the area, and finally had the opportunity to eat brunch there today. And I loved it. \n\nThe only thing keeping this from a 5 star review is that their ventilation system needs an upgrade, so the whole place is a bit like being in a campfire. BUT they're fixing it next week, so once I go back I'm sure this will be bumped up to a 5 star! \n\nLets discuss menu. The brunch menu has a few daily specials such as a French toast and a vegetarian option, and also a wide selection that they keep week to week. I just has to try The Remedy, which may not be good for those on a diet, but was basically life changing. Two deep fried poached eggs drenched in hollandaise on top of a bed of baked beans, hash, cheese and pulled pork. Sweet Jesus, it was like heaven! The coffee was also pretty good, which is always a plus!\n\nNow, service. Our server was so friendly and prompt, but also all the other servers were great too. Our server comped our drinks for braving the smoky atmosphere, which was totally unnecessary but really nice! \n\nSo while it doesn't hurt that Hadley's is about 5 minutes from home, I would be back even if it was on the other end of the city. Bravo Hadley's brunch!!
