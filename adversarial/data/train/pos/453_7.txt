It was my last day in Toronto before I flew back to Los Angeles, so I yelped a place close by to where I was staying for lunch.  This place had good reviews so my cousin, uncle and I came here for lunch.\n\nWe were their first customers when we promptly arrived at 11:30am and decided to sit on their patio outside since it was such a nice day out.  \n\nOur waitress quickly came out and brought us water and took our drink order.  The placemat is the menu so we were easily able figure out what we wanted to order.  Their menu consist of various thin wood-fired pizzas (8 or 12 inches), build you own, salads, and pastas.  They has several bottled beers, wine, and a pomegranate ginger ale which was so refreshing.\n\nWe started with the antipasto plate and the free garlic bread with check-in which came with two different meats, cheese, olives, eggplant, artichokes, mushrooms, and roasted vegetables.  It was a great starter to share and the garlic bread was great.\n\nThen we ordered three different pizzas to share, the rocket which had arugula and ham, the oh canada with ham and egg, and the superman with spinach, olives, and pepperoni.  We tried to order the muskoka pizza with sausage, but they didn't have any sausage.\n\nThe pizzas were overall good, but not as crispy as I was hoping.  I also thought they were a bit skimpy of the tomato sauce and cheese on all the pizzas.  Of the three we tried, the oh canada was my fav because an egg on top makes everything taste better.  They also give you chile oil on the side which I used to dip the crust in.\n\nService was very pleasant and attentive.  Our waitress was great at checking up on us with us choosing to sit outside.  Parking is directly on the street in the Long Branch neighborhood.
