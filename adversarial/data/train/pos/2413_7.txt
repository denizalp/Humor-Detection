If you like good\/great fish do not go here. If you want average AZ type of fish, an, \"All You Can Eat\" Fish Fry for 12 bucks, and you are not a picky person who knows good food than by all means go here. It is what it is. Kick it to three stars if you have a big appetite and want to eat a lot. lol---\n\nWe had dinner here tonight and it was just average. My friend suggested it since she heard raves but then could not figure out why. We had a coupon for a free Clam Chowder. I do not like that so did not get any. My friend said it was not good at all. We both got the fish fry. All we can say is, \"Meh.\" \n\nIf you are a big eater then it is probably a good deal. They do give you a lot of food though. The service bothered me. Our server was very nice but she got basic things wrong. I am usually very forgiving of that but it added to our non impressed status of the place. A Diet Coke turned into an Ice Tea and she figured the bill wrong. Also, the bathroom was filfthy. A big,\" No, No\" for me.
