I got off the subway to meet a friend and I had this place bookmarked at one point but removed it thinking I would never visit, however when I saw it, I knew I had to try it. While I try to eat very healthy and mostly vegan these days, I definitely do miss a greasy pizza.  Usually I can custom order a vegan pizza, but when I saw this place was also organic, I was SOLD SOLD SOLD. \n\nAtmosphere: mostly a takeout place with a few bar stools for eating in.\n\nWhat I ordered: Pepperonhy pizza. It had a thick crust with great texture. I usually prefer thin crust though, but I still loved it. In terms of replicating the look, it didn't come close to the real thing (vegan cheese is very easy to tell apart from real cheese) but the Pepperonhy looked pretty close.  In terms of replicating the taste, it was close except that it was BETTER!\n\nWhat I also like about this place is that they have a bunch of preset pizzas so you don't have to think. Thinking's hard man.  In addition, they have vegan donuts.\n\nVerdict: For a vegan cheat day, this place is da bomb and will definitely cause an Apiecalypse in your mouth.
