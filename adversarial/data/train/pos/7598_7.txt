Cool name + Cool Sports Bar + Cool burger + OBSCURE Location = 3.5 Stars\n\nHaving them bookmarked for awhile now, I decided it was time.  \n\nI had asked the bartender what was the most frequently ordered burger on the menu.  Without hesitation, I got a response of: the Sweet and Spicy.\n\nMy bubble thoughts went to work: \"Sweet + Beef = Potentially Disastrous\"\nSo, I probed the bartender on her take of the taste and assured me that the sweetness was going to be A-okay! Alas, I went for it!\n\nFor sides I went with regular fries plus a cold, refreshing ice tea.  As time elapsed, the moment of truth arrived, the burger that made them famous on Bon Appetit Magazine.\n\nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/siXCBrVFOXicbM2R-33-8w?select=y2GXX-6hg6cZ67E5lbLIcA\n\nBefore taking down this delicious work of art, I couldn't help but to admire the contrasting layers that was well put together.  Snap, snap, I tried to capture the best angle:\n\nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/siXCBrVFOXicbM2R-33-8w?select=aGGO64eLJtYt4ch4TVTnRA\n\nBack to business, first bite into the burger, I was sold.  My worries of sweetness went away.  In fact, it was kind of faint but still bold enough to call it Sweet.  The Spicy aka Candied Jalapenos was just as light and noticeable.  If I was to order this again, I probably would prefer a little bit more heat! \n\nThe other two ingredients that worked superbly well were the tempura fried ratatouille and fresh, green watercress!  The buns also played a critical role in its overall taste.  It was lightly buttered, toasted and slightly burnt to give it texture and that smoky taste.\n\nThe only negative that stood out was in the patty.  While parts of it was semi-moist with some pink, the outer layer was evidently dry.  And actually, the fries was a bust, it was just too crispy and anti-fluffy.  No love on that.  Hence, a deduction of .5 stars!\n\nIf there's one gourmet burger that I could have a craving for, it would have to be this Sweet and Spicy.  The bar has a stylish, contemporary finish to draw the sporty, trendy crowds with plenty of alcoholic options on tap.  The setup is well designed as patrons sitting in both the bar and booths can enjoy watching content on all the LCDs.\n\nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/siXCBrVFOXicbM2R-33-8w?select=vhZuCNn94Cmq_PzpOvle7w\n\nAll their burgers run $10-11 exception of the Kobe which will cost you a little arm and leg of $17.  I love Kobe meat, so I may be tempted the next time.\n\nHappy Hour runs M-F, 4-6PM.
