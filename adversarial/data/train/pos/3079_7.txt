How I've missed this place until now is still a mystery. My bf and I went on an unexpected date night here and left beyond impressed. From my giant $6 glass of wine, to Gio himself I loved everything about this small Italian hidden gem. \nThe outside looks like a place to grab a slice, and it is, but it's so much more than pizza. You walk into a romantic dim lit setting with Italian music playing, and a friendly staff, including the boss man Gio, his huge glass of wine, and welcoming attitude won me over before I even tasted the mouthwatering lasagna. Which was truly just that, literally the best lasagna I've had since my Aunt Paula's. The guy went for the steak and lobster special and was happy with everything other than the lobster. Said he'd pass on it a second time but the steak was of a decent quality and the homemade mushroom sauce on top is the real treat. Including wine and dessert we spent $60 and I can't remember the last time we have done that at a nice Italian restaurant for date night.\nEven if you're not in the area, it's worth the drive at least once. I can't wait to return and try more of their offerings!
