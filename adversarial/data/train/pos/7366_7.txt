Needed a few silver polishing cloths and Tiffany sells terrific ones- $5 for the small (7\" x 5\") and $20 for large (\"about the size of a kitchen towel\"), although the large was out of stock (as of May 8th).  These can be purchased at the service booths at the back of the store.  Many thanks to Service Coordinator Jessica Sampica!
