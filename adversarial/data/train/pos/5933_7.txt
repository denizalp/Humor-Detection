Was very excited that I could pay to upgrade to business on this flight#1665 from LAX to CLE. Until I got settled and my tv screen didn't work, which I know happens, it was the attitude of the flight attendant. She acted like she could care less. I had to ask them for every glass of water and ring them for a refill. There was no blanket and such poor service, I'm not sure United is going to be my airline of choice anymore. However, with an hour left into the flight another flight attendant did come over and tried to help while the other flight attendant was reading her magazine wrapped in a blanket. Not a great lasting impression United!!
