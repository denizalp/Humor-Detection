In a sometimes seemingly abandoned station, this is an oasis of life. When it was raining, it was the perfect place to grab some good coffee and pastries. I loved the brownie. When heated this thing is amazing. \n\nThere are multiple long tables for work and free Wifi. Large windows let in ample light.
