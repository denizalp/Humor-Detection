A solid 4.5, if 4.5 were possible! \n\nCute and cozy, IS SWEET is a great dessert getaway in the same complex as Viet Noodle Bar. \n\nHoney toast and cakes are plated with great presentation. \nTwo popular desserts:\n- 6.50 for crepe cake (Vanilla, matcha, or red velvet) \n- 4.00 for honey toast base, toppings range from .50 to 1.26\n- big variety of coffee and hot tea available \n\nSmall staff is very nice. IS SWEET has a small, family-owner vibe to it. \n\nThis place barely missed the mark, but the honey toast was not cooked completely through after coming out of the freezer and still had that undone\/overly chewy bread thing going on at some parts instead of being crisp and caramelized. \n\nCall me a 5 year old, but actually cutting a honey toast mountain with a butter knife is close to an act of God. Perhaps next time I'll BYO Knife, but at least there will definitely be a next time!
