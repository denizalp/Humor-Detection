Great atmosphere and good food. Salmon sashimi is one of my favourite things about sushi, and they definitely get it right. They don't have any salmon avocado Maki rolls (another favourite) available on the menu, but when I asked, they were able to custom make it. There are a lot of options but the menu is listed somewhat randomly--similar categories aren't grouped, but isn't really that big of an issue. The salad bar and dessert bar are definitely something unique and the iPad menu has more variety in Asian style dishes (thai, curry, etc). They also updated the iPad menu so that you can order the food yourself instead of having the server come by every time.\n\nOur main server, Eagle, was extremely nice and helpful. We had a lot of weird requests, but he was always able to accommodate them and was friendly the entire time, despite us asking so often.
