The only thing that isn't awesome about this place is the parking lot...when there are folks in the drive-thru, there usually no way to get around that line of cars to park, so you just wait.  Oh, and the interior seat cushions are a bit worn (being nitpicky now).\n\nThe food is delish (or d'lish, I suppose?), healthy, and somewhat creative.  Definitely NOT your typical drive-thru fair.  I've tried a few different things (wraps, cold sandwiches, hot sandwiches) and I always keep coming back to the California Club (no bacon please!) for breakfast and lunch.  It's impressive they are able to offer many organic and.or local ingredients for similar pricing to say, Subway.\n\nDepending on who is at the checkout, the service isn't always with a smile, but at least it's pretty quick.  And for a sandwich this good, I'm totally fine with that!
