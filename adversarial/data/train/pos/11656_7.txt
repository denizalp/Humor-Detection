Plan B is a spacious caf√© cum florist cum T-shirt shop situated at the subdued corner of Dundas East and Logan. Its scattered decor will have you looking in all directions. There's a giant Coca Cola sign, a wall full of t-shirts and onesies, a couple of fridges full of flowers. Instead of a mirror there is a little note in the washroom which reads, \"don't worry doll, you look smashing.\"\n\nIt's quite large also. A long communal table (which alternates very uncomfortable lime green Ikea chairs with solid wood ones) fills the space. Light pours in through a gargantuan garage door. The sofas in the corner are key if you need an outlet (i.e., for power not for your emotional surplus), because the table is barren of plugs.\n\nThey serve some pretty mean sandwiches (which they make each day), pour a solid espresso, and serve the aforementioned Coca Cola in glass bottles. The major draw is that it's not very busy so if you are looking to get some work done, it's a great environment to concentrate. Also, they only seem to hire cute girls who know a lot about pop culture. Maybe that's just Reighan. She's awesome.\n\nI'd like to come back in the summer. I suspect that magnanimous sliding door gets a lot more use.\n\nObligatory Title Pun: B excited!\n\nMenu Readability: Brace yourselves: the stunning menu is written on a chalkboard IN HELVETICA. I heard they used a projector. Brilliant.\n\nNeed to mention: They have wifi, but it's spotty.\n\nWhat this place teaches me about myself: I DO look smashing, don't I?
