This is one of the hubs places he likes to go to & look around. It's entertaining enough for me especially when on a hunt for a not so hideous flannel for the flannel ball this last NYE (unfortunately no luck there). I also have experienced the archery class with my sons scout troop back in the day. They were beyond patient with all of the exuberant boys. That was a fun trip for sure. I've also purchased a low end bebe gun for the kiddo that only fired a few times before jamming so don't go low end on those things it's not bueno. We also have had a venture crew Christmas gift wrap event. The customers were all kind & again patient with the teens gift wrapping skills & generous with their donations for sure. So all & all I'd say go to Bass Pro for all of your outdoor activity needs.
