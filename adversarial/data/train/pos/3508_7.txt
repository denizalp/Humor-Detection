You haven't been to Madison if you never step your foot to Memorial Union of UW. This place is the life of the city, from Winter to Fall, from morning to evening, this place is full of LIFE. All great parties are usually held here, straight, sideways, hippies, every kind of people's party just look for the right floor or room.  It has ice creams, coffee, food court, souvenirs, bus stops to nearby cities, you can find lots of things here... \n\nNeed some refreshments while studying for summer school? Just sit outside and enjoy the view of the lake and if you're guys, some girls are sunbathing in the bikini, woohoo!!!\n\nI didn't go to school here, but I love coming to this place, it's always HAPPENING!!!
