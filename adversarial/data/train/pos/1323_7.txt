Honestly, just don't go here.\n\nSince most of the people who commented before me ordered dishes other than curries, I decided to give the restaurant a shot: unfortunately, my experience was not good at all.\n\nI ordered the red beef curry and my husband had the green chicken curry. I have no idea where they get their chicken because I've never seen so much fat on chicken before. Their beef was a bit better, but it looked to me like it was still pretty fatty, only most of the fat had dissolved into the sauce. The sauce itself was average at best.\n\nIf you're on this street, i recommend driving down a ways to visit Thai Naka: tastes so much better and is for sure healthier; they also have better specials (more options) in my opinion.
