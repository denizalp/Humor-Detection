This airport is very easy to navigate around and the staff are very helpful. My dad's car died and they were quick to respond and happy to jump our car. Terminal 3, even though is under construction every time I visit it, is still a nice spot with all their high end shops and various restaurants to choose from. Overall my experience with McCarran from picking up out of town guests to dropping off and actually experiencing the airport myself has been good. Note that EVERYTHING is expensive though, so bring your own food and make sure you have all your electrical accessories.
