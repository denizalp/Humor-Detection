Holy crap, the worst Mexican good I've ever had. The shredded beef enchilada meat was flavorless and soggy. Rice and beans had little flavor. Yuck. Their salsa was like water with a little red pepper in it. I don't know what kind of Mexican food this is suppose to be but I wouldn't feed it to my dogs.
