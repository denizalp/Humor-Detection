just moved to the area. came here because my yelp app told me to. i trust a 5 star review average. ordered the veggie pizza and a couple of slices of cheese pizza for my daughter. enjoyed a garlic knot while i was waiting.\n\nloved the sign that said:\n\n*****beware*****\n\nreal italian cooking is going on in this kitchen. at any moment, screaming, arguing, yelling, cursing and other normal activities associated with italian cooking could break out. please just sit back, relax and most importantly, enjoy the food!\n\nwhich we did and i will be back as i need to try the white pizza and the eggplant rollatini.
