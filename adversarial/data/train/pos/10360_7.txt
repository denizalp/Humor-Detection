A sugar shack in the heart of St Henry. No need to drive 30-45 min out of town. They offer local ingredients and at 30$\/adult and 20$\/kid for an all-you-can-eat. The only thing is that you will not find any ham, sweet sausage in syrup, creton or oreille de criss on the menu. You do have bacon and mergez. Still...it would of been nice to have, at the very least, some oreille de criss.\n\nOnto the food. BLAND!!! I think they were out of salt, vinegar...anything that would give life to the food. The ONLY good thing was the bacon. Even the mergez was dry and overcooked. The slaw had NO sweet vinegar dressing. The pancakes tasted like they came from a box. The soup was tasteless. The potatoes, beans, the eggs had NO salt. None! Even the desserts were bland. The sugar\/syrup in the flan wasn't caramelized at all. The sugar pie, kid you not, lacked sugar. HUGE disappointment! I was coming here expecting much more since they described everything being made with passion on their site. Not worth 30$. Not even 10$.\n\nService was good though.
