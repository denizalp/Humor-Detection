A little overrated but still delicious.\n\nTheir set up is a little confusing.  They have two different doors, one side for cupcakes and the other, for ice cream.  Every time I went, they had people standing outside, in attempt to answer questions\/direct you into the right door. I like the concept but didn't like the execution. I was honestly a little intimidated. I felt like they were very nicely attacking me with flavor menus. It also felt a little awkward because I'm used to walking by a store front and going in on my own terms. I knew going to the Linq that Sprinkles was on my must try list but when I actually got there, I felt pressured to go in. \n\nAnyways, the ice cream is delicious. My first time there, they recommended the cookie ice cream sandwich. You order first, then wrap around to the other end, pay, and wait for the goods.  While I was waiting, I couldn't help but notice there were flies landing on the cookies\/brownies sitting in the window they had. I'm by no means a germaphobe but felt very disgusted. I kept watching the flies to make sure they didn't go near the cookies I chose; and honestly, in my mind, they probably already have... I just didn't wanna admit it.\n\nEverything is a bit overpriced here but I expected that. I'm not a HUGE fan of cupcakes. I only tried a couple bites from my friends. Pretty good but their frosting is a little sweet. Totally biased on my end though... Lost my sweet tooth years ago.\n\nI hope this review doesn't garner hate or offend anyone. I was turned off during my first visit with the whole fly thing but I have gone back twice since then (didn't notice any flies the last two times). I'm still a fan... just not super impressed.
