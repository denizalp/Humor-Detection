I've taken Audrey, my Audi, to Virginia Auto Service a couple times for routine maintenance. I first heard of them through a coupon in the mail, though I'm not sure how they got my address! :)  \n\nBeing new to the area and because the Audi dealership is way up in north Scottsdale, I decided to give them a try. Not to mention because I value the more personalized service of a small business, but that's a longer discussion... \n\nI've been thoroughly impressed with VAS's personal service, their ability to squeeze you in on relatively short notice, the ease in making an appointment, and their communication on what the deal is with your car.  They also have a free ride service to drop you off and pick you up, which is highly convenient! \n\nIf you have a European car, I highly recommend giving these guys a try!  I'm fiercely protective and OCD about my car -- if I trust Audrey to someone, you know you can.
