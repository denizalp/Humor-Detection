This is tough to review. Before Mystere I'd seen Ka, O, LOVE, & Zumanity. All newer and flashier.\nIf you go in having seen those and not an open mind, you'll be disappointed. If you remember this was Cirque du Soleil's first resident show in Vegas (or anywhere, I think) it helps.\nIf you have only seen the traveling shows or never been to Cirque... Dive right in!\nTaken at face value: it fun, exciting, and has proper Cirque \"Wow!\" moments. Definitely worth seeing. \n\nThe Good: Of all the Vegas Cirque shows, this one probably has the most audience participation (maybe Zumanity is close). If you like that kind of thing it's pretty funny. \nThe Bad: It's showing it's age a bit, but like I said, if you don't let it's big, expensive siblings color your judgement, it's still exciting and worth the $$.\nThe Creepy: Sorry, I know they're supposed to be funny, but that baby is disturbing.
