Two weeks ago I finally got to check out Downtown Summerlin...and I have to say I really enjoy the set up out there! It's actually just a freeway jump from my house and you have pretty quick access from the 215 and the Sahara exit!\n\nSo far, in my first 2 visits, we have enjoyed shopping at \n\n- The Toy Box\n- Hot Topic\n\nand eaten at..\n\n- MTO Cafe\n\nBut, while walking around, we see a bunch of places we want to check out in future visits! They also have a Regal Luxury Theater that I will definitely be checking out in the very near future!\n\nAnother thing I noticed was that they have security patrolling the area in both trucks and on foot! I think this is a fantastic idea! There is a ton of parking and all kind of retail outlets to choose from!\n\nI really dig the layout and will definitely be out here a lot more often!\n\n4 stars.\n\nYay! I'm a fan.
