Awesome workers! I have been noticing lately that the workers seem to be in a better mood, or maybe that is just because these are new replacement workers. Hmm..\n\nDon't forget every other Sat. is 50% off and you can always tell what the sale is that day by looking for the colored balloons floating from the signs in the front of the store. No more asking random, cranky strangers if they know what the color is that day, or hunting down the nearest employee. We all forget, come on.\n\nNot sure what store this used to be, but the layout is weird because everything is sectioned off and the mens\/kids\/linens\/women's shoes section is located down a ramp which I was tempted to race my cart down. Eh, I like the quirkiness of this place!
