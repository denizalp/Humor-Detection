Please keep in mind that this was only my second cirque du soleil show (with the first being Michael Jackson's Immortal) as you read this review. \n\nWe went on a Sunday night, the 9:30 showing.  The door opened at 9, but there was no need to get there early.  I heard this venue was tiny, but was definitely surprised how small it is in person.  There really isn't a \"bad\" seat in the house.  We were seated in section 201 row BB.  We didn't have the most centralized view, but that was fine.  Sections 202, 203, and 204 have better views if you're into \"best\" seat in the house.  \n\nNow onto the storyline...or was there one? I couldn't figure it out either way.  The whole baby character is a bit too bizarre for me though.  And without giving the show away, I thought some of the other characters such as the \"French man\" was a little distracting.  His main purpose was to provide some sort of comical relief to the audience, but I didn't find him to be funny.  \n\nThe acrobats and trapeze were outstanding of course.  They sure take the free show over at Circus Circus to the next level and above.  They're the ones we paid to see, and they did the show justice.  \n\nOverall, I liked the show, but I wish I enjoyed it a little more.  Then again, I was fighting the urge of falling asleep after a day out in the scorching sun AND a dinner buffet.  But at least I did better than the guy sitting next to us, who was asleep the entire time.  His gf stormed out of the venue as soon as it ended...and what happens to him after that is a myst√®re.
