As much as I love this place, I really think I'm twenty years too young to be here. I really love the genres played here and I consider myself pretty well versed in the music. I can't figure out if I'm a young person with a taste for real music, or if everyone who likes real music is older than I. \n\nI showed up on a Friday which is the night when Baddness plays. I think it was them because they played stuff from EW&F, Gap Band, Maze, and bunch of others. No blues that night, just funk. The thing I loved about this band it that I would've expected to see them in an early Jarmusch film like Mystery Train. They were a five or six piece band in all red suits with the lead vocalist in an all red, sequened coat. It was quite possibly the most badass thing I've seen on a music stage in Phoenix. A definite A plus for music and style.\n\nAs far as a blues house goes, I don't really know if I'd consider this one. The Rhythm Room seems to be more up my alley and they seem to have to be a real venue for artists passing through. This definitely seems more like a dive bar\/lounge for people who like the music. Again, I really want to come back to this place but I think I should wait a few more years because clearly I should've been born twenty years earlier.
