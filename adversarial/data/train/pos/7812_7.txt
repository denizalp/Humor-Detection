Ummmmm... GROSS!!! I saw with my own eyes that the chef\/cook at the open kitchen who was stirring the sauce he was making with a spoon, tasted it, added more seasoning, wiped the spoon with the kitchen towel in his hand, put the SAME spoon back for stirring and pour the sauce on an entree before the waiter took it from the kitchen and served it!!! Is this acceptable? Is this even legal? We went there on Saturday (05\/05\/12) at around 9:40 pm. He was wearing a red baseball cap. I was stunned. Actually wanted to leave on the spot but my company didn't want to leave so I had to eat there :(
