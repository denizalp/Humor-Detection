We called in to have a pizza delivered and we were told the delivery guy called off. No problem, we will pick up. Thirty minutes we were told. We came in thirty minutes later to be told the kitchen was a little backed up, it will be another five minutes. We sat down and waited, and waited, and waited. 30 minutes went by. At no time did anyone offer us an explanation as to what was taking so long. Finally, a customer walked back in, returning a pizza. I knew right away what happened. They gave our pie to the wrong guy! We went up to the counter and confronted the gal. She admitted that it was her fault, and that they were making us a fresh pie. Why not tell us that up front? We would have ordered a drink and waited. In the end, no attempt to appease with a discount on our next order. In fact, the gal got kind of snippy with us when we confronted her. The pie was good when we got it home, but they should have been honest with us from the beginning. They should have attempted to take care of us while we waited, or offered us something on the back end for our troubles. Completely mishandled!
