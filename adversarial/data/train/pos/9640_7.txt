Sorry to everyone below me, but this is the WORST sushi place I have ever been to.\n\nI would rather eat sushi from a gas station than here.\n\nI have given this place many chances, but it is always nasty.\n\nThe rolls are chock full of rice and not much else.\n\nThe buffett (I'm not a fan of places that have the food lying out like that) is always half empty and nothing is delicious.\n\nOishi Sushi must be avoided at all costs.\n\nSpeaking of, they've been lowering their prices steadily for the past year or so.\n\nHint hint?
