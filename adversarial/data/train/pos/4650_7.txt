I would not recommend this place to anyone. I purchased a Groupon voucher months ago and was able to use it here, however the cashier had no idea about it so the manager was consulted. The manager seemed reluctant but processed the voucher anyway with attitude. Seemed to me he wasn't too happy with accepting a voucher...why offer it then?  \n\nFood itself, was mediocre. I've had better chicken at the Woodbridge location and the Richmond Hill.
