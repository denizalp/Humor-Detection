It had been about ten years since we last visited Tamba. We went there for dinner during our last trip to Vegas. We noticed a major improvement in the ambiance of the restaurant. We were informed that the restaurant was renovated internally about 2 years ago. Tampa has made some very nice and noticeable changes to its interior. Tamba could use some improvements to the exterior as well. It is deep set in an aging shopping center which prevents Tamba from completely standing out and getting noticed.\nThe quality of the food and the service was excellent. Service included knowledgeable servers who wasted no time in informing us of the daily specials and the top selling dishes of the restaurant.\nWe had the Pani Puri for an appetizer and it was delightfully flavorful. For dinner we had the Butter Chicken and Tandoori Chicken. Both of these dishes were prepared to our taste buds' liking. The sauce on the Butter Chicken consisted of the right texture, color and flavor. The Chicken Tandoori lacked the artificial color (Thank You) which many Indian restaurants use to make it red however it tasted as chicken from a full flavored tandoor oven. It was tender and had the right combination of the herbs and spices.\nIt was a delightful change at Tamba from ten years ago and we will visit again.
