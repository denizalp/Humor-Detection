Jane is a miracle worker! I am Italian with olive skin and dark hair, but somehow was given light eyebrows!! So I've colored, drawn and powdered on my eyebrows for almost 15 years... Until now! I had my eyebrows done by Jane in January, and cannot be happier with the results. It's amazing to wake up in the morning and have perfect eyebrows. She will do a test draw on you before the tattoo to make sure you are happy with the arch and look of the brows, then the entire process takes about 20-30 min an eyebrow. Jane takes so much pride in her work and it shows. Literally so pleased with the results and I tell everyone to come here! You will not be disappointed.
