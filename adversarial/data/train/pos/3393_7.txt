Dr. Sharma is very knowledgeable and diagnosed my cough professionally. He prescribed to me 2 medications, and the next day I felt a whole lot better. He also said that my small muscles in my chest will take an extensive amount of time to heal on their own, and reducing my coughing with the medication would help. It took a long time to see him, but it was definately worth the wait. I would recommend his services to anyone.
