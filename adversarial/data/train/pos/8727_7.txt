My nephew wanted Sprinkles cupcakes for his birthday but I really wasn't up to driving all the way to Scottsdale so I looked up cupcakes on Yelp and found Sugar Daddy Cupcakes. Thanks to Stacey A I found it right away. The cupcakes were bigger and cuter than Sprinkles. I loved the glitter on top of the cupcakes. They were just as good as Sprinkles and the bakery is next door to my favorite place to shop. Does it get any better than shopping and cupcakes?
