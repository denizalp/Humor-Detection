An Ode to Hunger:\n\nA man, traversing the concrete seas, hearkened by a song\nWaylaid by a beast of foul nature, thought to be long gone\n\n\"Curse you bitter cravings!\" I cried. \"You treat me oh so ill! \nIf you had but form I'd slay thee well! And you'd be a worthy kill\"\n\nPoor temperament my hunger caused, when a hat-of-ass appeared\nHe swerved in front of my vessel, and I nearly impacted him arears\n\n\"Another evil villain I would put you in your place\nShould you chance upon me elsewhere I would long to punch your face\"\nThis hunger it's a deadly thing that disposes me to violence\nWhen all I truly wish for is a peaceful bit of silence\"\n\nAnd there! Over yonder swells, I see the red and blue! \nAn island made of pizza, pasta, sandwiches and brews!\nI knew that making landfall was my best and only option\nMy appetite necessitated that I stop with little caution\n\nI entered this blessed haven, and uttered the basest of behests\n\"Bring me quenching ales, for I'm traveling deep into the west\"\nThe servant brought the pints and a pizza quickly after\n\"These victuals are the tits!\" I cried, bellowing with laughter\n\nThe servant soon returned with a slip of paper marked with runes\n\"Thank you sir, you've had your fill; Now I need your doubloons\"\nCarefully I read the sum: I couldn't believe mine eyes\nThe total was entirely reasonable and my pocketbook should survive\n\nWith the monster in my belly sated, it was time to resume the quest\nOnward, HMS Hyundai Accent, may your voyage be the best\nAnd should the monster reappear, we'll vanquish him fo sheez\nOnce more unto the breach, and another detour to BP's
