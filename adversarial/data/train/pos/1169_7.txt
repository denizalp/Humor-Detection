Update:  I decided to check a little further in to the rumors that Mickey's was closing up shop and found a couple of things...  1) They were finishing up repairs\/updates as of my visits over the last two weeks, 2) They closed their doors on 07\/31\/2009 and put up a sign saying RIP, 3) the owner is searching for a buyer for this and his other spot in Scottsdale.\n\nFrom what I can find, it doesn't even seem that the employee's knew they were shutting down.  Certainly nothing was said on either my visits over the last 10 or so days. Such a loss to the HH options in Scottsdale!  : (\n\n__________________________________________________\nThe reporting of Mickey's demise was premature. It was in fact undergoing significant repairs and renovations (although I saw no major improvements during my visit two weeks ago).\n\nIt has re-opened and is back to its perfectly odd  and inviting self.  : )
