Shame on me for not dining here sooner. NOCA is absolutely perfect in every way possible. I can't even begin to explain how ridiculously delicious the food is here. You just have to experience it for yourself. \n\nMy friend and I each each had several courses for dinner. Naturally, we shared each one to sample as many things as possible. The pork belly confit was divine. The mussels steamed in in white wine, garlic, and chorizo were titillating (make sure you have extra bread to sop up that amazing broth). As for the main course and dessert, I won't go into details, but both were simply stunning in flavor and presentation.  \n\nSuper fresh ingredients. Inventive menu. Impeccable service (except the fact that they lost my reservation... thank goodness they had a table for two available!), and not the very least pretentious. Book a table at NOCA and bring on the foodgasm.
