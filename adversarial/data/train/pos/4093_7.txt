My husband went in to find something that was custardy for me for Valentine's day and came home with a fruit tart that the sales girl said has custard in it.  It was a fruit tart, not custard. She was so intent on making a sale she didn't care what she had to say to earn it.\nFurther, it didn't even taste good. Thanks Westside Bakery for ruining Valentine's Day.\nI will never go back.  This is the second time we have been disappointed by the recommendations of a counter girl.
