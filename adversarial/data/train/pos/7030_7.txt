This place is probably worthy of 4 stars, but we went in a group of about 30 so it's hard to know. Their beer is SO expensive. We got the Verdura pizza which was good, but the onions were supposed to be carmelized and came out raw on the pizza, which I wasn't crazy about. I probably won't try it again.
