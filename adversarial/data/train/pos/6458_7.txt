I guess all the hype that surrounded this place in prior months has slowly died down because instead of waiting for hours, we walked in, sat at the bar, and ate. Nice. Kobe beef, fleur de sel, truffles, lobster? Who the hell puts this kind of stuff on a burger? It's pretty insane. Was really tempted to order the $60 burger, but then I thought of the children in Africa and how at the cost of this one hamburger, it could feed a kid for a year. Stupid conscience! I'm totally going back and ordering that shit next time! Great beer selection, I think the Dogfish Head IPA would go well with the Kobe. Oh and you gotta try the zucchini fries, this is a must. My only complaint is that there's too many things to choose from, too many delicious things. It's like being forced to choose between laughter and fun, you lose either way because you're missing out on the other.
