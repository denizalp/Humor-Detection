One of the worst Metros I've ever seen. Awful service (good luck trying to find someone to answer a question, and believe me, you will have many. For example, about the prices because many are missing, or the fact that an empty shelf may need to be restocked because you need bananas). I mean is that too much to ask for?\n\nOk, so the store is under renovation, but that's not necessarily the issue. \n\nVery little organic produce options. Very little fish options. Many products have carcinogenics (baby products too!), line ups to pay for your groceries are unacceptable.\n\nJust the other day, I went in and witnessed a young worker holding a broom over the deli bar, from the outside in, while someone on the inside of the bar while hosing down the floor, sprayed the broom with water, as they were horsing around like two young boys. Of course the boy with the broom carried the broom back over the deli bar and walked away, dripping dirty broom water all over the packaged food. I stood there in awe! Dirty, bacteria-infested meat, anyone?! And, overpriced too? Yeah, let's overpay for mediocre food and get gastro  in the process. Lovely!\n\nSo...to those who think that when people put in negative reviews are simply people who enjoy being negative, no my friends, no. These are all eyewitness accounts, and believe me, I love living a positive life, just Metro is getting in the way of that. And, I'm trying to prevent you from getting salmonella, Listeriosis, etc. \n\nPeace.
