(Lyrics - Lipps Inc. - Funkytown)\n\nGotta Yelp a place to some bites that's right for me\nTime to keep me eating, keep me munchin with some energy\n\nWell, I Yelp about it Yelp about it\nYelp about it, Yelp\nYelp about, Yelp about\nYelp about eating\n\nGotta move on\nGotta move on\nGotta move on\n\nA-won't you take me to Koreatown?\nWon't you take me to Koreatown?\nWon't you take me to Koreatown?\nWon't you take me to Koreatown?\n\n\nKoreatown is a spacious Korean eats hot spot that is fairly new.  The place is located in the same shopping mall as the International Market where you can find almost anything!\n\nMy first thought of Koreatown was the signage wasn't that great and plus you really couldn't see if from the street.  The place itself however is very large and can seem to seat up to 50 plus and great for large groups.  \n\nFor starters I ordered the Japchae; sweet potato starch glass noodles fried with vegetables and beef.  To my surprise this starter was quite large and can definitely be an entree if you love this dish.  Slippery noodles with a prominent sweetness to it, while the vegetables provided a hint of crunch.  Overall, my favorite bite of the night!  For my entree I went with the  Chirashi sushi bowl; pretty much sashimi cut in cubes served with a salad.  The dressing came on the side which I appreciated; it was sweet with a hint of spiciness.  \n\nOverall, my experience was great.  Korean food is starting to pop up around the valley and they keep getting better!  Koreatown is well received in my books and definitely a spot I'll keep attending since the menu is meant for a foodie to explore! - Enjoy!
