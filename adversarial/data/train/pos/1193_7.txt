So glad they finally gave a Nekter on this side of the Valley. As much as I love downtown it's so much better to drive 10 minutes instead of 30. I love how fresh everything is especially in this Summer heat. Today we tried a few new things as well as one of our new found favorites the skinny colada. We had a Açaí banana berry so yummy! Full of granola, blueberry, banana..so much goodness in one bowl. Very filling and it doesn't leave you feeling over full and tired. My niece ordered a pink flamingo and she it's one of the best drinks she's ever had. The atmosphere is great. Nice and bright and even has some really great seating. Take your pick of a booth, bar tops, couch or chairs.  This is a busy place on the weekends.
