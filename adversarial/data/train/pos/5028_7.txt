Finally a place that's not to far away. I was in search for a place that is opened 24\/7 and it wasn't a sleazy casino or bar. It's actually a good family restaurant.\nI am not to sure about the history in this restaurant but there is an actual mannequin at the check in desk. I am not sure who or what it was suppose to represent or resemble. But it sure did freak my kid out. \nOnward to the food, after we sat down our waiter took our drink order. Which was nice, afterwards our drinks were brought along with some garlic knots. I would say those garlic knots where so addicting and probably my current favorite item on the menu.\nAfter reviewing the menu, me and my son decided to order the lasagna, my son's option was a meat one and I ordered the vegetarian one.\nNow the kids dishes are pretty good size, and enough to fill em up. Now my lasagna was decent and not the greatest, my broccoli on top of my lasagna was so thick and crunchy it was hard to eat together and I really didn't understand why it was prepared that way.\nI definitely will not order that again and will probably try something else. I just couldn't get pass the weird texture and bland flavor.
