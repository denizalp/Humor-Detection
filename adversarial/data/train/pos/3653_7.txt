Lime green walls, oh my!\n\nAs close to authentic as one will get outside of Mexico or Painesville. Flautas were not the tiny cigar size one gets at most places but the actual almost burrito sized. Guacamole could have used a little more cilantro, but that's a personal preference. Rice was just rice. Let's face it, the only way to season rice is to cook it in chicken stock, and that kinda becomes an issue for vegetarian\/vegan peeps. Speaking of, there's a pretty large section of the menu dedicated to that diet style. Portions are huge, and the prices reasonable ($10-15). Xangos (fried cheesecake) was enormous. Definitely not for one person.\n\nService was excellent! Place is clean; the parking somewhat odd.
