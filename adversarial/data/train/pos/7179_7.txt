Located in the Chinatown plaza between Wynn and Valley View, so you know the parking can be challenging, especially being a few doors down from Hot N' Juicy. Once you enter, you will see bar and a wall with hundreds of books. I'm not sure if the lights are ever bright enough to comfortably read, but it was a nice touch. We had made reservations in advance, but it appeared to not be necessary when we arrived (probably because it was a Tuesday night). There is a hallway marked by letters for each room. We occupied room E and it was more than enough space for our party of 10. \n\nThe staff here is so accommodating and the attention to detail is second to none. When you're ready to order food, drinks or have technical questions, just press the red button by the door. They literally run to your room within 10 seconds. There is also happy hour on the rooms from 6pm to 9pm! Since we arrived at 8pm, our first hour was $17.50 and then back to the full price of $35 for the second hour. They also asked if we were worked in the industry without us having to mention it upfront. The additional 10% off definitely helped. Just make sure if you have your employee ID or business ready at hand.\n\nThe room comes with two mics and two TVs on either side of the room so you can either be shy, or face your fears and sing your heart out in front of your friends. They also provided two tambourines for additional entertainment. The selection of music was pretty extensive. Many different languages that I won't even try to get into. The most impressive was how up to date the English section was. Even when we were settling the bill at the bar, they asked if we wanted a bunch of water bottles to go! Yes, please and thank you!\n\nOverall I would definitely come back and take advantage of the whole happy hour next time so we can use more money towards food and alcohol instead. :)
