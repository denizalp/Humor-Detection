So I came back here during my last trip to Vegas and I must say, Omnia has proved me wrong. it is pretty cool. This time we got a table upstairs which made the experience better. The chandelier IS SO FREAKING COOL. You can't see all the cool rotating and special lights and stuff from the dancefloor, but if you're upstairs you can definitely see everything and it looks so much cooler. We were right above the DJ booth this time so we had a pretty good view. I also was able to see the dry ice action away from the dancefloor and it is INSANE. They literally blast dry ice out into the dancefloor for like 15 seconds and it turns the entire dancefloor into a giant ball of fog. It's kinda terrifying, especially knowing that some chunks of dry ice can fall out of the machines and burn you. So still, keep your eyes closed! But yeah the chandelier is really cool, the lights are insane, and the sound quality is pretty great. But the dry ice is killer.
