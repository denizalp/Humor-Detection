Last weekend we left the Gilbert Farmers Market hungry for breakfast, but saw lines out the door at the places nearby, so we wandered on down Gilbert Road and saw the sign for The Groves.  After glancing at the yelp reviews it looked like no one had discussed breakfast yet, so we thought we'd give it a try.\n\nWe had regular eggs\/bacon\/hash brown\/toast breakfasts, with the addition of some B & G and everything was cooked perfectly.  The coffee was not memorable, but not bad.  The service was also ok.   They have several really young gals working, which is fine, but sometimes the lack of focus is there.   After they drop the food, they should come back within 1-2 minutes to see how everything is.  We were fine, but don't disappear until it's time for the check and my water glass is bone dry because I've chewed up all the ice cubes.  \n\nThe dining room is one big room with the bar on the north side, and I think if we go back we'd sit at the bar.  That seemed to be pretty lively which I always enjoy.  The only thing I didn't like about one big open room was the toddler across the way bellowing his needs for all to hear.  His complaints echoed through the entire room.  I see from the pictures there's some outdoor seating so maybe next time we'll give that a try.  Overall a pretty good first visit and I wouldn't shy away from going back.
