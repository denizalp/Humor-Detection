HELL NO!!!!!!! Took a friend here who was looking for a cheap room for the night went to look at the room before he paid opened the door and bugs ran behind the sink. And the room smelled like a old car with a bad motor, a\/c sounded like a plane bout to take off. Don't go please don't go they need to tear this place down and start over.
