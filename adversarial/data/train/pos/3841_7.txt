I don't know what people deal is with Winder. They have a way of doing things and your either with it or your not. We've had the service for almost 3 months now and everything's been great! There was this time where they delivered to the wrong house but they also comped our whole order for the mistake. We're human it happens no need to cry over spilled milk. We get our weekly delivery on time, online ordering is fast and easy, and tho i do agree that their food is a bit pricey, but your going to pay one way or the other. Either buy cheap GMO and pay out the butt on health care, or pay now for quality organic food & take care of yourself, your choice. People complain a lot. So if your reading these reviews just know, most of these complaints are from people who don't understand how the service works.
