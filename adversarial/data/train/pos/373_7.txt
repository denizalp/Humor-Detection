Clever pun, Nine-TWO-Five, clever pun. \n\nPros: convenient location, cheap battery replacement (just $5 after tax!)\n\nCons: the owner. Dude's always on the phone and gets annoyed when I show up for just a simple battery replacement each time, rather than buying some overpriced \"jewelry\" from his store. He gave me attitude one time for not having cash and paying by debit (yes, crappy of me, but attitude so not necessary).\n\nI just suck it up and tolerate his stinky attitude for the 2 minutes it takes him to replace my watch battery, and then book it out of there and get on with my day. What a downer.
