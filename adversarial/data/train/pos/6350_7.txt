After my 4th amazing visit to this spot, I have to write a review.  Every experience here has been wonderful.  The paito is even really nice, however I perfer sitting in the dining room where you can see the chefs at the robata grill.\n\nHere are a couple of things you MUST try:\nButterfish Tataki\nAny of the sushi...especially the Big Eye Tuna and the Tuna Belly\nWagyu Beef \nPrime Beef Filet\n**Hiratake Mushroom drizzled with truffle oil and truffle shavings.  This was seriously the best mushroom I have ever had in my life.  I think this was a special, but ask for it...you won't be dissapointed!**\n\nThe sake was delicious and they also had a great wine selection.  I chatted with a few men at the bar before we were sat and they boasted the tasting menu.  Once we were sat at an awesome table, we basically ordered enough that it could have been a tasting menu...but loved that we were not limited to certain options.\n\nI would also recommend dessert.  We had the dessert platter and it was insane!  3 or 4 fresh sorbets, fresh fruit, and 3 (I think...dammit the wine!) different desserts.  It came on this cool boat packed with ice and flowers...very cool.  However we mainly picked since we were so full from everything else.  \n\nEach time I have been, even on Valentine's Day (with no reservations), the service was amazing and the wait staff is always very attentive.\n\nPLUS, this place is right next to Terrior (check out my review if you aren't familiar).  So you can hit up Terrior before or after for some wine\/cheese and swinger action. ;)  Does it get much better Scottsdale?  I think not...
