Their ganache and pavlova is to die for. First went here around Halloween time of last year,  and have been going since! The service is very friendly and they were very helpful when I was making my choices. Their cake presentations on display were beautiful and I'm definitely ordering from them for my birthday this year. I'll make an updated review then, and I'm sure I won't be disappointed! :)
