Just your run-of-the-mil Black Angus chain steakhouses. I was in town for the weekend and met up with my family at B.A. We've been to B.A. before at different locations so nothing was foreign to us.\n\nWe ordered the campfire feast, which includes two dinners for two adults with an appetizer and desert for $40. I ordered the chicken and rib plate, my daughter ate the ribs which was 1\/4 rack. I had the chicken, it was okay, a little plain. I should have stuck to my staple when I go there, the teriyaki steak. I like their baked potato soup, it's normally tasty. \n\nI've noticed that the quality in Black Angus has significantly declined in the last 15 years. It used to be that you were able to order a steak plate and the steak was bigger than the broccoli spear it's accompanied with. Now, not so much, they serve mini steaks. \n\nMy biggest gripe with my experience at this particular restaurant was our waitress, she was super rude. She came to our table, rudely asked us what we wanted to drink, and started taking the menu's away before we had a chance to look at them. She was slow to get our drinks and food but she sure was quick to pick up our food (even though we weren't done with it). We had to tell her not to take our plate, she saw we were still working on our plates, so I'm not sure what the hell was wrong with her. When the bill came she must have lingered around our table to see how much tip she was getting. She quickly picked up the bill before we were done, which is rude. We must have asked for extras like napkins and to go boxes without her acknowledging it. Killer part is that the restaurant wasn't even busy. I'd say 0 for effort.
