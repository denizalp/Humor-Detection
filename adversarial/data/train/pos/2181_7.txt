Itty Bitty MadHouse Coffee Review\n\n- On a cold Sunday night, the boypren and I dropped by for something hot to warm us up.\n- 12 ounce red velvet mocha with almond milk for me.  Americano coffee for him.\n- The drinks hit the spot.\n- Funky little coffee house at Desert Inn and Durango in the Von's shopping plaza.\n- They have hookahs here!\n- Keith Haring theme is kinda retro and very cool.\n- I'll be back to try the \"Michael Jackson\" drink:  white chocolate and regular chocolate coffee drink.\n- I'm a fan of the red velvet mocha.
