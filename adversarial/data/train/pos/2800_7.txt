Wow, Zia records, this place has been here for such a very long time now. They even opened one in Phoenix.\nThe great thing here is you never know what you will find at a Zia location.\nSince people bring in their own things to sell , and trade, you find all sorts of cool items here.\nThe staff is great and they will even order things for you if they do not have it in stock. I mean where else would this happen???\nThe parking has always been a little tight. But, the cool thing is they are open 7 days a week until 12:00am. Yes, midnight. Awesome right!!!
