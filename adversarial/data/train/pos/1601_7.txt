My husband and I had to run an errand at AZ Mills and had not eaten dinner yet (at 8:30p) because we had a busy evening! Luckily, Garcia's was open until 9 PM and was willing and able to stop our hangry feelings. :) \n\nWe were seated right away, brought chips and salsa and BEAN DIP (yes, this is complimentary) within minutes. WHEW! My husband and I pretty much inhaled these goodies. Then, I checked in on Yelp and they have a lovely check in offer for a free cheese crisp with the purchase of 2 entrees. We'll take it! \n\nFor dinner, I ordered the fajita salad with steak and it was pretty tasty! I recommend getting the Southwest Ranch on the side as well. This salad is HUGE and served in a taco bowl. I ate most of the goodies out of it but could not finish the entire thing (especially after inhaling loads of chips and the cheese crisp). \n\nFor chips, salsa, bean dip, a cheese crisp, and 2 LARGE entrees, we were out the door for $31 including tip. This is not too shabby! If you're in the mall and looking for a yummy meal, i'd recommend Garcia's for a shopping break. Plus it is local and family-owned. Thanks for the great service and filling our hangry tummies!
