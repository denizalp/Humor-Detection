It pains me to write a bad review about a liquor store. Not because I'm an alcoholic...anyway.\n\nSo, I go into Lee's, which happens to always stock some pretty good stuff, but this one looked like it only had vodka or big bottles of crap I don't drink. Don't get me wrong, I DO drink vodka, but I have plenty of that. No, I was on a mission for beer. \n\nI walk in and head straight for the cooler. I wasn't going to drink the beer in my car (thanks, NV liquor laws - JUST KIDDING), but I was going to probably start before the garage door closed. You need frosty beer for that. Did Lee's have that? Nooooo. Did Lee's have my fave beer in a 6-pack? Noooo. I had to buy a 12-pack. It's almost like they do that by design. You know, encourage my drunkenness. Well, I don't need any help, LEE'S. What I DO need, is to buy my favorite beer in the most convenient way for ME. In that you failed.\n\nI have a friend who happens to like Maker's Mark. I have no idea what it is, I didn't know where to find it so the very friendly employees (and they all are) guided me to, you guessed it, the biggest bottle Maker's makes. Hey...never mind. The mammoth extra large size was all they stocked (seriously?)\n\nAnyway, I'm tired of buying Costco sized liquor already. If word gets out I have gallons of liquor in my house all my degenerate friends will want to come over and drink it. Not helpful.\n\nBut, in all seriousness (if it's possible), I really need to buy my beer, cold, in small quantities and the kind I like (they were missing one of the three that I went in to buy). Otherwise, you are dead to me. Fix this. \n\nI probably need to go find a meeting after re-reading this. \n\nGreat store, great employees, really terrible selection.
