The thing about an urgent care is they are not your doctor nor should they be and if you are having a serious medical condition then definitely go to a hospital. That being said, I get sinus infections. Urgent care is pretty good for that sort of thing. \n\nThis location used to be a Blockbuster in a past life. Now it is a newer and fairly spacious Urgent Care Extra. The \"extra\" part probably comes from the fact they are able to do x-rays here and offer to fill your prescriptions in house too. \n\nTypically I've gone mid-morning and the wait has never been too long. Never quick but then again I don't take the \"urgent\" part of urgent care that literal. Both times they have had family friendly shows playing on the tv in the waiting room. I've sadly now seen more than my fair share of Fuller House (oddly could not look away) and Goosebumps (tv series not the new movie). \n\nThe place seems clean but I did happen to notice what appeared to be blood on the floor in the waiting area. Not sure how long it had been there or if anyone even knew it was there. Possibly a little more attention could be put into keeping the waiting area wiped down in general. They were not busy so it seems not like too much of a request.
