I drove clear across town to have lunch here and it did not disappoint!  One glance at the menu and my \"healthy lifestyle\" went right out the window.  I indulged in the Heather's Choice sandwich with a side of truffle sweet potato fries and of course I couldn't resist ordering some mac n cheese!  Absolutely deliciousness.  Cheese, bacon jam and peppers between two slices of bread, I think so!  I brought the husband here a few days ago and he ordered the breakfast mac n cheese and said it was the best breakfast that he has ever had!  That's saying a lot because that man LOVES breakfast!  All I know is if you like truffles or cheese or delicious food, you should eat here!
