randomly saw someone ig this place and since I was going to Vegas anyways, might as well try it!\n\ngood thing we came here during happy hour! I love cheaper food :) \n\n- ox tail pho - the ox tail was pretty tender. pho was ok\n- serrano pepper wings - 50 cents during hh.  I thought these were okayy. not bad but kind of plain. the pepper wasn't too spicy so that was cool\n- oysters - $1 each during happy hour.  I think they were pretty good. fresh so that's good\n- yellowtail tacos - I like these!  I love the crunchy hard shell.  the fish was in this green sauce which I think went really well with it.
