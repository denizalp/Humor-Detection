This show blew ball sack.  I loved the guy's TV show, but the live show is horrible.  First of all they have these annoying ass vaudville type characters marching around and acting like dumb asses with French accents.  Not funny.  Then this guy starts with his act thinking he's funny and charming or whatever.  He's got the camera on his crotch for way too long.  The magic was 2nd grade stuff.  I could tell you how every trick was done, and I mean every trick.  This wasn't even a magic show.  It was more like terrible theater.  Imagine Shakespeare in the park meets dungeons and dragons.  This show gets the finger and so does con Chris Angel.
