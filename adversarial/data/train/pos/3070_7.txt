I remember the first time I ordered from here - 6 yrs ago when we first moved into the neighbourhood.  And it was good. And it is still good.  And every time I nom I always think, why do I ever bother with Swiss Chalet? (Especially when it is sooo much closer to home.  [After I finish reviewing all my neighbourhood haunts you will probably be able to triangulate my exact home location.])\n\nLike Julianna B. I prefer the rotisserie over the grilled chicken. The combo sizes are generous and best part is that it still tastes great reheated the next day.  The sauce is tasty and is available by the jar.  Still haven't figured out how to exactly replicate the churrasco chicken at home, but the sauce sure helps!
