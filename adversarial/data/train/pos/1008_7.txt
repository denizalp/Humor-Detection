Wow! Came in for lunch and got paneer tikka masala. Very good and I'm super full after. Interesting interesting idea to have combination with ice cream. \n\nOnly negative is there was way too much onion in the food. So unless you're obsessed with onion, I'd recommend to request no or light onion. \n\nWill definitely come back.
