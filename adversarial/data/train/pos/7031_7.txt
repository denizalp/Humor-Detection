I dig Avatara's dedication towards providing vegan options, and their quirky pizza names, but it really ends there. \n\nI went here with a friend a few weeks ago to see what all the hype was about and make an informed opinion for myself. I was a little bit underwhelmed. At Avatara, one is able to order a half pizza, which is exactly that. Not a smaller, personal sized pizza, but an exact half pizza with about four small slices included. I like having this option, as sometimes I am dining with non vegans and don't necessarily need a whole pizza to myself. \n\nI ordered \"The Aristotle\" with Daiya Cheese and my friend got the vegetarianized \"Che Guevara.\" I would have ordered the Che based solely on the name, but I wasn't a fan of the toppings combination at all. Upon ordering our half pizzas, we sat down, and waited for about 45 minutes for our pizza to be made. This isn't really a sit down spot, but there are a few tables and some drinks, so we made ourselves comfortable. \n\nI was happy to have so many awesome vegetable toppings on my pizza, but was not impressed with the crust at all. I have made many a vegan pizza crust, and all have been better than this one. I understand that they offer whole wheat to promote a healthier option, but I use whole grains tons in my recipes, and they don't have to taste lifeless. Not to mention, I'm fairly certain a topping or two was missing on my pizza. They also need to learn how to cook Daiya properly so it doesn't turn into a half melted tapioca mess.\n\nI didn't like the weird things they served our pizzas on. Also, my friend mentioned upon walking out that even though we had each just eaten half a pizza, she was still hungry. Overall, I am just kind of bummed someone is able to sell vegan options like this and make money from it, when my friends and I can make pizzas twelve times better than this at home.
