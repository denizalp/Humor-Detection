First off, let me say I despise most chain corporation food outlets. Donato's was the exception that I used to hold up. Since it's the closest thing to thin crust Dayton style pizza I can find in CLE, I'm willing to drive half an hour round trip for it. \n\nOnce again, employee incompetence ruins my fun. \n\nOrdered online. Got there and the pizza was ready but homeboy couldn't find my garlic bread. After five minutes bumbling around in back, they found it. Not really sure where. \n\nEagerly but patiently drive home (watch out for Lakewood cops) and tear into my pizza... \n\nWHICH IS NOT EVEN FULLY COOKED. \n\nPeople bitch about a lot of petty shit on Yelp, I'm aware. Mushy dough is not one of these petty complaints. You cook pizza. Just do that one thing right!
