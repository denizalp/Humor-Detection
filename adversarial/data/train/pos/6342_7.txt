Tower City Center gets three stars from me. Why? Well, it's a medium of two major factors, a positive and a negative. Read on and I'll explain. \n\nFirst of all, Tower City is not a mall anymore. Well, unless you're looking to stock up on personalized graphic tees, light up belt buckles with your name flashing, Bath & Body Works garb, or lots of info from the pro-life kiosk. Other than that, we agree. Tower City WAS a mall, and a cool one at that. But over the years it has dwindled down to chotchy stores, abandoned shop fronts, and an experience that can leave you feeling relatively unsafe if you're alone. \n\n*Le sigh*\n\nSuch a shame, I know...\n\nOn the brighter side, Tower City brings Cleveland together. It holds and connects many of CLE's biggest companies within its office buildings. The history of the building itself is rich and fascinating beyond what most of us understand or care to know. And the architecture....Please do me a favor. Next time you find yourself in Tower City, look up. Soak in the intricate details taken to make this building so beautiful. Beyond that, it serves as the connector of the city through its easy access to our great public transportation system, the Rapid. Business men and woman utilize this service daily to get to and from work. These people are making amazing things happen in Cleveland and it all comes together in this building. I love that. \n\nClevelanders don't appreciate how amazing this building actually is--and for good reason too! It's certainly taken a dive in the past years, and that's putting it lightly. But I can't wait to see what progressive movement of Cleveland has in store for Tower City. With all the amazing things coming in the 5-10 years, I think we're in for a great surprise!\n\n...Until then, I wouldn't recommend walking around there alone at night. It get's just a wee-bit dicey.
