Popped in on a Friday night and the place was hopping. \nLet's start with the restaurant...the place was spotless....Clean, well lit and more spacious than it looks from outside.\nThe menu is pretty varied....seafood, gyros, burgers, etc...but the place is a fish and chips joint.\nI ordered the halibut and chips. It was $15.95 and it included a large piece of halibut, an ample portion size of  chips and coleslaw. The weakest component of the plate was the coleslaw..,it was pretty bland and unappealing.\nThe halibut was delicious....cooked perfectly....excellent portion size. The chips weren't the best I've had...but they were good non the less.\nThe staff were stellar. Attentive and fast. \nGreat food, decent price, great staff...would recommended will return.
