3.5 stars. Very good, not spectacular. The ribs were smoky but still kind of tough and the house sauce wasn't a great complement. I heard good things about the burnt ends but they were sold out. The brisket was outstanding; I'd come back again and again for it. Worth the visit alone.\n\nTheir potato souffle thing was overcooked and average. Beans were reheated in the microwave and the foam container melted, kind of gross looking but the beans were decent. \n\nService isn't too friendly, but I never judge places based upon if they smile or not as long as the food comes out hot, and in this case it was so hot the container side melted.
