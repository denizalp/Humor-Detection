I believe I had this older woman who I believe is the manager of Hooters and she come up to me and told me how was my food and I did tell her that my chicken wings Had  a lot of breading on it and she said OK and just walked  away from me and never even wanted to give me some new wings and the french fries had 10 pounds of salt on it and she didn't even care and she's a manager ??? She just walked away from me , so as a senior advisor , I review this restaurant way below one star.\nThe only one I would get five stars to is the  waitress Gabriele\nNo way will I come back here again. Now she can go walk away from her job
