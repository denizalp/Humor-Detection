Saw Weezer and Panic at the Disco here - the acoustics\/sound system and light shows were really amazing!\n\nTraffic from the highway to the parking lot flowed pretty smoothly. I was happy to see a heavy police presence directing traffic lanes. Parking was easy - just follow the gentlemen with the orange flags. I was pleasantly surprised that the parking was free.\n\nNow the confusion begins - multiple lines and the people in line have no idea which line they are in or why. It would be nice to have more employees milling around to answer questions and tell people where to go. Add to that waiting in the blazing sun for 45 minutes to get your bag checked. Add to that all of the a$$holes who cut to the front of the line and act like they are entitled or \"just didn't know\" - right - you had no idea you were cutting in front of the line that runs around the corner, down the block and onto the road.\n\nAfter asking (and showing our items to)a staff member - they said we were cool with our blanket in a totebag. Different story when we got up front.  People on either side of us were shaking out their blankets for security checks and we had to point this out to him - of course at that point he couldn't say no. They really need a more clear and publically posted list of approved items to bring in.\n\nBeer is expensive but if you drink Domestic at $11.50 for a 25 oz can it's not the end of the world. I will not however pay $14.50 for a 16oz can from NODA when I can get a four pack at the brewery for $8-10. \n\nAte the world's crappiest stale pretzel for $5 just to absorb some beer - it was so dry and dense I literally choked it down.\n\nPhone reception for internet and texting flat out sucks.\n\nAlmost no line at bathroom (while acts are playing).\n\nNot a bad experience, just know what you're getting into and be mentally prepared. We go for the bands we love and not necessarily for the venue.
