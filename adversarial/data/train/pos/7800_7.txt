Great customer service and healthy, tasty options! They even have a drive thru if you're lazy and don't  want to get out of the car like myself :p\nI got the \"808\" bowl which includes tuna, spicy tuna, tamago, lettuce, masago, chili flakes, green onion, and sweet onion in a sesame shoyu sauce, on top of a bed of warm white rice. The tuna was really fresh and had no fishy taste\/smell at all! The marinade was perfect, flavorful with a hint of sweetness. \n\nI will definitely be back to get my hands on one of their sushi burritos.
