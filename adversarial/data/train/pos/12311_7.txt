A restaurant that turns into a bar later in the evening.\n\nBier Markt is a new, clean ornate and sterile place.  This space reminds me of the giant brew pubs you run into in the suburbs of Americana, except this one isn't surrounded by a huge parking lot just down the divided highway from the mall.\n\nBier Markt does have a terrific selection of biers\/beers from around the globe on tap, really good Belgiums, Germans, Framboise's, they even have Brooklyn (hoe!) Lager.\n\nThe crowd at Bier Market is well dressed and good looking upper 20s into 30s.  We weren't there for very long, but this place seemed like a pick-up bar.  Our expedition did find that a breed similar to the American Cougar can indeed be found as far North as Toronto.  Apparently, this species is more versatile than originally believed.  Attempts to control the spread of this dangerous predator have not been successful.  Beware or happy hunting!\n\nAlthough, more pretentious and with more attitude than other places we visited, patrons of Bier Markt were still friendly.  There wasn't a cover when we got there, but when we left an hour later there was a line 40 deep waiting to get in.\n\nLive entertainment at Bier Markt at 9:00 on a Saturday consisted of a cover band.  Prior to their set, the deejay was killing me spinning a set of 90s Top 40 that included that SWV song that sampled Michael Jackson's Human Nature and that cherry cherry cola song by Savage Garden.  I'd never been so happy to see a cover band take the stage just to get that deejay away from his laptop.\n\nThe mega-bar isn't really my type of place, but given how club-centric downtown Toronto is, this place wasn't that bad for the older crowd.  At least they've got lots of tasty beer.
