I have a complaint about this location. First of all, who's running this place? Both female trainers are more preoccupied hitting on each other.  Another female goes missing as soon as her boyfriend walks in. Thus leaving only two other people, a guy and another girl, who are more interested in what each other has to say. \n\nThere's no one doing anything aside talking to themselves and hitting on each other. I'm not so sure what's an adequate temperature to train but I'm pretty sure 80 degrees isn't it.  I guess since no one really checks on them, they are free to do as they please. \n\nA surprise corporate visit wouldn't hurt.
