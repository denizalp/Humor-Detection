This place sucks!  The staff, they don't even see if you need any help!  When I checked out!  The cashier, didn't say hello, did you find everything you needed or anything.  She said 6 words to me!  Debit or credit? Step over here!   Not even a thank you and the end of my transaction!  They need some serious training in that store!  I'm sure they might not be in business much longer, with the hair plus store down the street as there competition!
