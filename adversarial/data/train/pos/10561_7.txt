OMG!  This place makes my Fav Five Collection!\n\nI'm so happy that I didn't see the calorie count for these pies!  The only reason that I went there was becauase of a Talk thread and Pie Commission comes up again and again!  Now I know why.  So good!\n\nWas it happenstance or serendipity that I found myself at PC?  I was heading to a client and I thought I best get something to eat before getting there as it will be a very long day.  Looked for places I haven't been and up pops PC.  Probably been on the list over and over again but I assume PIE meant dessert stuff - never gave it a thought.  Not this time.\n\nIf you happen to go there, you can park in the parking lot or go down the side street and park in front of the place.  I didn't know where it was until I saw a tiny sign that took be down a tight driveway to a bz and tiny lot.\n\nWalked into the place...it is a tiny place!  Just enough space to change your mind and nothing else.   I was confused and the gal told me that the menu is on the wall and I can have their pie baked, unbaked, or frozen.  I opted to take the top three.  The braised beef, butter chicken, and beef'n'beer.  The braised beef was for now, the other two was frozen - they gave me baking instructions.\n\nThe packaging is cute and I was wondering why a beef pie would not be on a plate...well...you can eat your pie like a beef patty.  OH SO GOOD!  Rich flaky buttery pastry holding in chunks of beef and gravy.  Thank the Lord the other two were frozen or I might have gone over-glut and food coma'd out!\n\nOver the rest of the week, I did get to baking the other two.  They baked perfectly from frozen.  The butter chicken had a kick and I was not too excited about the beef'n'beer.  3 down and 4 more variety to go.  I think there is a slight discount if you guy them unbaked and a quantity of 4.\n\nMy stomach is Growling as I write this review.  I guess I better get there sooner than later!\n\nCHEERS!
