Having grown up in Chicago, I was SO excited when I heard that White Castle was making its way to Las Vegas.  Why its taken me so long to get down here to eat, I honestly don't know, but we found ourselves right next door yesterday, so we decided to stop in.\n\nSo...ok, I get it.  Not everyone understands the perfection that is the White Castle slider.   But I have to say, I'm shocked about the low reviews here, especially when my visit was so good.  \nMaybe I'm blinded by nostalgia, but my husband has never had White Castle before, and he loved it.  \n\nWe ordered small and cheap yesterday:  one original slider for my husband, one fish slider for me.  \n\nThe original is a delicious steam grilled beef patty on a bed of onions, with a pickle, and a soft bun.  It was perfect.  \n\nThe fish slider was even better than I remembered.  Juicy, and full of flavor. \n\nLocals get a 10% discount!!\n\nService was friendly, although I did go when it was pretty empty.  \n\nI will most definitely be coming back again.  \nGreat job White Castle!
