PDQ is comparable to Raising Cane's being that they both have a menu built around chicken fingers and they are made fresh and not frozen. Chick-fil-A serves freshly made chicken too but can't be compared to PDQ as far as flavor goes among many other things. Chick-fil-A tastes much better. The chicken fingers I had here were not bad but they weren't crispy like the menu described them to be and they were soggy and mushy. I got my order for take out so it's possible that the chicken sits in a steam bath when packed for take out until you are ready to eat it and that maybe makes them soggy? I am not sure but I've had them a couple times now and they were not crispy. Shakes are 50% off from 3 pm to 5 pm. I had a peanut butter pretzel shake and it was very good! I'd come back for their shakes no problem. The workers were friendly and upbeat and they also have sandwiches and salads on the menu.
