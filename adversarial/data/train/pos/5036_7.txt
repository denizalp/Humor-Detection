The reason for the 3 stars is because of the go-cart racing. There are 3 different tracks to accommodate different age\/experience drivers. This is the only reason to come here, to drive the cars, nothing else! \n\nThe reason for the 2 missing stars is because everything is sticky and overpriced. You'll find carnival style rides that should come with a barf bag. I haven't tried any of the food, but it's looks and smells less than desirable, so I'll pass.
