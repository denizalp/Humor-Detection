Their upside down gin and tonic tasted like rubbing alcohol mixed with flat Sprite and a dash of formaldehyde. Blech vomit dégueulasse ! Be afraid, be very very afraid. When I hear the words \"molecular gastronomy\" I instantly think of the chef extraordinaire himself, Ferran Adrià, and his Mecca of inspired post-modern haute cuisine, \"elBulli\" on Catalonia's Costa Brava. But ... Fibo oy yoy yoy... this is sooooo not that. Seriously, folks, flashy dry ice magic and some spherification of juices does not .... molecular gastronomy make. Beware the evil that lurks in the dark shadows and in the little minds of those men with shit eating grins. They will rob you blind. Trust no man for he will disappoint you with his shitty \"concept\" cocktails and piss in your eye with his molecular gastronomic bullshit and lies. Vomit. Vomit first then run. Something wicked this way blows ... and it really really blows and not in a good way. Don't go here. Run, run away now. It really really really really really really really really really sucks ... and again, no, not in a good way. It is superbly horrible. I cannot emphasise to you enough how shitty this shitty place is. I will gladly pay out the wazoo for good food and drink. I make it rain, baby, but I'm never paying 15$ for a gin and tonic again unless I get insurance on it ... or taste it first. I don't care about your shitty gimmicks, I don't care if I can drink it upside down. I'll drink you upside down. I don't know what that means but whatevs. No, no, sireebob, do not waste your limited time and hard earned dollars on this horrid scam of a place. Life is too short. Avoid at all costs. Save yourself. You are most welcome.
