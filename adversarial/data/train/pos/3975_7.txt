What a fun meat market! Came for a bachelorette party, rolling deep with about 10 girls sporting their best slut gear.  The bouncer picked up on this and literally bounced us around pimping us out to different bachelor parties who had tables. This was a little insulting but also really thoughtful because we were too cheap to go in on our own table lololol.  \nThe music outside by the pool was good and fun to dance too.  The place was not insanely packed but had a good amount of people.  There were different rooms with different vibes, dancers, lights, and effects. Never had to pay for a drink or wait for the bathroom, or pay a cover, if you get on the guest list and have a vagina. This place is fantastic for people watching and was pleased to see a pretty mixed crowd.
