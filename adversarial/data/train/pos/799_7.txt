They have Nintendo and beer.  \nThat should've been enough, but fine. They have plenty of great bottles of beer, a great welcoming and knowledgeable staff and a nice handful of beers on draft. Charlotte does have several good bottle shops now (none of which are really close to my home), but Salud still just feels the most inviting and is my top choice to go if i plan to hang out for a beer before taking some home. \nIt would be cool if there were more comfy seats around, but they do quite well with the space they have, including an outdoor space which i'm yet to utilize.\nThey also have a mirror in the bathroom with its own Twitter account (@saludmirror)...so what more do you want? Go and enjoy yourself.
