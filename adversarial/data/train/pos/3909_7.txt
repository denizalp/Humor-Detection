I came to this location after being told at the 285 College St. location that they only stock RAM here.\n\nI came in for some RAM for my mac laptop, I was looking for a specific one that the website assured me they had in stock. I was told by a sullen teenager-type that no, they didn't have it in stock. That was it. Nothing he could do fo me, no advice, no nothing. I had to press him to tell me if they had any other brand I could use, and to explain to me why one may not work. Frustrating. Never again.
