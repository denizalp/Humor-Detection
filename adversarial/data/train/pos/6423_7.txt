I love both of the Body Blitz locations, but the East is closer to my house, so I end up there most of the time.  \n\nI visit only on weekdays, and earlier in the week, it is rarely too busy.  I know many people complain about there being too many people in the waters- but I have to assume that they are going on weekends.  \n\nThe waters are great- their teas are divine and the staff is always helpful.  \n\nThe only downfall has been the massages. I've had four massages there now and most of them have been lacklustre at best; one was downright terrible.\n\nDespite asking for deeper pressure throughout the massage, they never work any deeper than what I would consider medium. I'm not looking for crazily deep massage, but I want to feel the treatment and get things worked out.  I've also found that despite asking to focus on one area, they seem programmed to do \"x\" amount of time on back, \"x\" amount of time on legs and so forth- disregarding my problem areas and concerns.  I guess in the end, they do a rote relaxation massage- the same thing for everyone. If you are looking for a standard light pressure relaxation massage then you will be fine with the treatment- if you are looking for anything to work out muscle kinks, this is probably not the place for you. \n\nI love the waters enough that I have tried the massage there so many times, in the hopes of finding a therapist that I like, but I have had to resign myself to the fact that the massages there are mediocre and over-priced.  It's a shame, because the only thing that could make a day in the water therapies better is a good massage!
