This place is dangerously near my new digs and they deliver. Actually, maybe it's not so dangerous since they're so close, as I'll be embarrassed to have them deliver since it'd be kind of pathetic of me. Or maybe I'll be OK with it in a pinch? Maybe I'll fake a limp? OK, these things should have stayed in my head. \n\nOoof. What you really want to know about is the food, not my neurotic relationship with delivery, so here goes...\n\nIt's the cleanest and freshest Indian food I've had in Toronto at this price point! Mutter paneer, chicken vindaloo and achar with basmati rice and garlic naan all made it to my door in a timely manner. Their online menu is huge, but they didn't have the paneer I wanted listed but when I asked for mutter instead of saag they didn't even note it not being on the menu. When it comes to delicious Indian, at Amaya if you can dream it they can do it. Yes, it's so good I'm writing in clich√©s.
