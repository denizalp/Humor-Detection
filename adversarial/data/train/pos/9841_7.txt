I feel like I'd be doing a great disservice to the world if I gave this place a 3 star rating, so it's a 4 but it's really a 3.5 at this moment. I'm no stranger to The Cups, I've been to the Yonge and Finch location a few times but the one on Yonge and Steeles is ma main crib. I've been there so many times that my friends joke that I could single handedly keep their business alive (there was one summer where I went there everyday after work, I kid you not). \n\nMy favourite is the injeolmi shaved ice and while I've tried most of their other flavours, this one is the one that keeps me coming back. I'm not a fan of mochi but it's a nice blend with the injeolmi. Like the other locations, there are ingredients layered between the shaved ice so it maintains the flavour. \n\nNow what I didn't like from this location: the milky flavour they have in their ice is barely noticeable, whereas the other two locations had a distinct milky taste, this place was so lacklustre it tasted just like regular snow. I only noticed it halfway digging through it because of the excessive amount of condensed milk they drizzled over and buried underneath. The amount of condensed milk was a killer towards the end of it. Way, waaay too much. I left the store with a nasty feeling at the back of my throat. Not even water could remedy it for a while. \n\nService was lovely though, just like at the other two locations. Their decor is very trendy and hipster, and it's always nice to walk into a clean atmosphere. \n\nI would definitely come back -- once they settle down in this location. For now, I'll return to ma crib on Yonge and steeles but I do see myself coming back here soon.
