I wanted to treat my dad for dinner and he felt like seafood so to Oyster Boy we went. \n\nWhatever time you go, phone OB for a reservation... even if you plan to eat really late. Reservation-less at nine o'clock, we had to wait for a good half hour before we could even sit at the bar, which was like 2 feet away from the door. Having a regular table was double the wait. The star count has not changed since my last visit though. I'm still a fan of this place.\n\nThe seafood here is great, but the ceasar salad was a definite bust. For almost $7, the quality of the salad was not great. My dad noted that the lettuce was brown and thus not fresh. We both ordered the fish and chips and a draft beer and we were quite satisfied with our main dish. \n\nI'll be back ..... with a reservation, of course.
