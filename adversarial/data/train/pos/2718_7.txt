We wound up eating at this particular location due to the fact that their other location in downtown phoenix had a longer wait time.\n\nIt's not a particular expansive establishment, but they managed to make do with what they had. They definitely had an overwhelming amount of patrons. Every table was taken, and there was a prolonged wait.\n\nThey have wonderful service, and their food; although not spectacular, was quite tasty. The food selection isn't vast, but what they do offer, they execute quite well.\n\nI had the hog and chick, and my wife had the waffles. She was more enthused about her selection, than I was about mine. \n\nOverall, it was quite a satisfying brunch, supplemented by wonderfully brisk and attentive service.
