This is one of the nicest auto places i have been to. Now I'm no car junkie or all that knowledgable about cars and auto shops, on the contrary, because of my luck with locking my keys in my car and having an equal share of car troubles, I have seen the inside of a few varying car care places and dealt with several mechanics. \n\nThis Findlay Honda, wow, the customer service is definitely top notch. I had come in to get a recall taken car of on my car. Now even though the service was a little over 3 hours, i was prepared for it because i brought my laptop and was comfortably seated in the lobby area which has couches, and enough space for everyone while we wait for our cars to be taken car of. The second thing that really stuck out to me is that there is a small section designated for children to play if necessary. I also really like the vouchers that they give you for a bagel or coffee from the little snack stop that is located inside. I think that this is a very nice addition for the customers because the car service may take a while to be completed. \n\nthis time i came to the dealership for new breaks and also a routine oil change, and i was originally under the care of George Green, he graciously let me know that I was Myrons customer and that Myron would continue taking care of me. I thought that is was great customer service as well. Both of these gentlemen were extremely professional and have definitely helped me take care of my car to the best of my ability.
