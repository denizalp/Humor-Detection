This is an excellent spot for happy hour or just hanging out with friends over some beer and nibbles. The small local brewery is tucked away within a quiet, mostly residential area along 1st Street not far from downtown Tempe.  You can select from several house brews as well as from outside brands, and of course getting beer flights is always a fun way to try several kinds of brews to help you decide which beers to concentrate on for your current visit or the next. In addition to the indoor space, there is a porch area as well as an outdoor patio - the latter being my preference because of the open space makes for a more relaxed atmosphere and because it is just next to the Fire and Foraged food truck, which serves excellent yet very affordable comestibles to go with your brew choices.
