The first thing I ever had here was the onion soup velout√©. The second thing was the same as the first. It was so nice, I had it twice.\nThe next time I ate here, it happened again.\nI think I have a problem, but I do not want help.\nJust more soup please.\nThe next time I came here they TOOK THE SOUP OFF THE MENU.\nSo I cried.\nI'm not even lying.\nThe next visit to fleur, my onion soup was mysteriously BACK ON THE MENU.\napparently, I was not the only one who cried.\nNOW\nThere is a NEW SOUP. \nMexican street corn soup.\nIt is indescribable. \nIf someone spilled a bowl of this soup on the floor of a New York City subway, I would lick it off the floor.\nIt wouldn't even have to be the last bowl on earth. Like, if we were together in the subway, and it was you who dropped your soup on the floor and I was still holding mine safe and sound, yes, I would still eat yours off the floor.\nI don't think that I could pay it a higher compliment.\nP.s.\nThe staff is very nice.
