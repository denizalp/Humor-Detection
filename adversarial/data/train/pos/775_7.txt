Beware! Don't get stuck sitting in category 3, 4 or 5 as you will need to bring your binoculars to see the performers on stage. Only category 1 or 2 is advised otherwise you will be truly dissapointed. My tickets were free thank goodness or I would have felt royally ripped off!\n\nThe show was ok, I saw it two months after it had rolled out. I had high expectations and was dissapointed. This is probably the last of the Cirque shows I would choose to see if granted the option. \n\nHonorable mention: The Elvis Bar rocks! Best drink I have ever had! I ordered the \"blue suede shoes\"! Served in an Elvis souvenir 32 oz cup It was the bomb diggity and you can bring your drink in to the show, hell yes, I needed to get a buzz in order to make it half way happy through this show! I could have easily closed my eyes and just listened to the Elvis album tracks they played rather than attempt to watch the ants run around on stage.
