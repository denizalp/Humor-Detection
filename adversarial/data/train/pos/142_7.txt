Place was a joke. Worst strip club ever. Went there for a friends bachelor party it was recommended by our bellhop at our hotel. He called up to make sure we can have the bachelor on stage for their show... When we got there the Fat manager of the club demanded a hundred dollar cash tip at the door... To sit in the back and wait for a table to open up. The rude bartender  would give change in large bills and demand tips for getting every single beer. \nAfter being there for several hours I asked the manager when my. Buddy would be getting on stage. His response was that he didn't receive a good enough tip.\n\nPlace is a scam. U get a tip when you deserve it. Here's a tip. Loose some weight you fat loser
