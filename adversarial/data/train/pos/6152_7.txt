I've never stayed at the hotel, but I've been to the casino countless times since 2009, and I have to say that IMO it's the best one in downtown. The buffet and restaurant, the microbrews they make ($1.75 a beer), the bartenders, everything is great. There is also an arcade close by in the hallway that connects to The California.\n\nThere's an old timey feel to it, but it's not rundown or anything like that. There is also a piece of the Berlin Wall in the men's room, connected to the urinals. One time, as I was going to use them, there were some tourists (don't know where they were from, somewhere in Europe) with cameras right inside the bathroom taking pictures, one guy and two girls. I was tempted to just go up to the urinal and make my liquid deposit, but I decided not to as the girls might have laughed had they seen the size of my trouser snake (trouser worm?). Instead, I waited patiently until they finished up. That was the one and only time the Berlin Wall urinals were ever an issue. But yeah, it's a great casino.
