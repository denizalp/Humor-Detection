This is one of those places that although I can't say I love the food, I continue to come back because it's right up the street from home.  I've never had anything here I thought was great, but I've never had anything I thought was bad either.  Chips are always hot-big plus.  My husband and I share the Julio's appetizer platter for our meal quite often-more than enough for two and a little bit of everything.  I do think the guacamole is above average as it should be for $7.50.  It's nice that it's mostly avocado rather than a vegetable garden with a teaspoon of avocado for color.\n\nThis is a great place to take those Midwesterners who think Taco Bell qualifies as a Mexican restaurant.  Always reasonably clean so good for your germaphobic friends who don't understand a little hot sauce on the menu is a sign it's so good you can't put your chip down long enough to read the menu.  We've always had excellent service as well.
