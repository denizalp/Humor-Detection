There is a cockroach in the bathroom, eww! I waited 3 hours the first visit, AFTER making a scheduled appointment. (Natural hair only ) Hair style is not what I asked for, there's a big ugly  braid across her head. Todays appointment,  yes I had a scheduled appointment again, took over 4 hours!! Not worth the time or money.
