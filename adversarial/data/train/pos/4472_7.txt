I bought my water system at Lowes 9\/8\/12. Their contractor, I'm guessing is  Las Vegas Quality Water.\n\nWOW. THEY SHOULD CHANGE AND HIRE A REAL COMPANY.\n\nThe technician who came, did not come prepared. When I went to Lowe's I let them know that I had a stainless steel sink. The technician's drill that he brought, did not go through my sink. It just turned bright red (from all the heat) and had metal shavings go every where. He had to call a co worker for parts and equipment. \n\nSO WE WAITED. AWKWARD.\n\nHe left a complete mess underneath my cabinets... I'll attach pictures. Cables sprung up at me out of no where, and he left wood shavings all in my clean pots and pans. They say when it comes to change my yearly filter it will be \"free\"... We will see in a few months.\n\nKEEP IN MIND, THIS IS STILL UNDER WARRANTY. I haven't even had this a year, and I am noticing black particles in my ice, and seeing as how we did an ice run line as well, I called the company, and jumped through a few hoops. I told the technician about the black in my ice, and over the phone, he told me that it sounds like one of my tank's filters has ruptured..... I was told that a technician would call me in a few days to schedule a drop by.\n\nThey called me a few days later from a number that only had four, YES, FOUR (4) digits. So I didn't answer, because, one I don't answer numbers I don't know, and especially an odd looking one. An associate left left a message, and for extreme personal reasons, I was not able to get back to them.\n\nWeeks later, we were in contact again. The woman that I dealt with was excessively rude, telling me that they would not be sending out a technician, because there was nothing \"wrong\" with my water..... even though it's the water that goes to my freezer. I told her about what THEIR technician had told me over the phone about a rupture. She told me that I need to have my freezer checked out. Refused to even send out a technician to CHECK.  This has not happened before I got this system.\n\nKEEP IN MIND... STILL UNDER WARRANTY.\n\nI've paid HUNDREDS to have this installed. They'll get your money, and then treat you like garbage. NEVER using them AGAIN.\n\nA technician came out to change filters, and what do you know, NO MORE BLACK CRAP in our ice cubes. \n\nCheap company that doesn't want to do anything extra.
