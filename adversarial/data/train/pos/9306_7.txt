Yes! Yes! Yes! I am soooooo happy that they reopened and I'm over the moon happy that they are super close to where I live. The quality of food is out of this world. The staff is fantastic. The wine is wonderful. The ambiance is quaint.\nI usually order 10 pintxo's for two people so that I can have a assortment of different plates and flavors. They have some pintxo that are \"classics\" and others that are the special of the day. Some of the plates that I order EVERY time I go are as follows:\n- Foie gras torchon with onion confit (a MUST)\n- Crab and shrimp stuffed piquillo with a shellfish sauce\n- Garlic prawns with roasted red pepper sauce (yes!!!!!!!!!!!!)\n- Stuffed fig with serrano ham and mahon cheese (I wonder if they can deliver this to me now)\n- Goat cheese raviolis with duck stew (ok, I'm starting to get hungry)\n- Grilled lobster tail (I love youuuuu)\n- Duo of salmon tartar (eh, I think I'm naming all the items on the menu)....\n\nPlease hold as I make a reservation for tomorrow!
