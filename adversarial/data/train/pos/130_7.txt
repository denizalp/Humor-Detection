My first visit and if it's like this every year I will certainly be back.  I think the best thing I liked about it, besides the fantastic pig, was the cool names of the BBQ competitors.  But lets keep this in perspective, the food is why you come.  Yes they have bands, they have craft beer but the pig is the reason for the season.  \n\nPark your car and as soon as you get out you will get a wiff of the BBQ and it's like a trail of bread crumbs leading you to the promise land.  \n\nShout out to Rocky Top Smokies for their generosity with samples of their award wining pig!\n\nIf I had any criticism it would be to get the local beer involvment up a bit and I think this even would be a complete blowout for all involved!
