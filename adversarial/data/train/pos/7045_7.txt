\"We don't make halves but you can eat my whole!\" -- This appears to be Southside Steaks motto.  They are open late and they have fairly nice people working behind the counter.  For our inception into this local sandwich shop, we ordered the following items:\n\nOriginal Steak with provolone and onion\nFries with gravy\nPepsi\n\nWe were easily able to split this meal between two people; it was that large.  The sandwich was okay.  It was a little salty and the onions and cheese tasted average.  Just nothing memorable.  The fries and gravy could have been a bit better.  The gravy was chunky and had an off flavor that I personally couldn't handle.  I was satisfied with my half-cheese steak and Pepsi.  Time to move on.
