Went to no regrets today to get memorial tattoos for my triplet miscarriage with my mom and mother in law. The man working the front counter was beyond awful. First, he said my idea was dumb and that I didn't wAnt to do that.  Then he Made it very clear he didn't have time for us, snapped at my mom about her not listening to him and really just lacked all around in customer service. I am so glad we went somewhere else and were treated with the respect we deserved. We had no regrets about leaving!!!!!  Jerks.
