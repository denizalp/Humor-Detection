Unfortunately, I didn't get my FIX.\n\nI am in the middle for this place. The service was great, they were very hospitable and just attentive without being intrusive. To conduct such service in an environment, where everyone is either drunk or not from there ... is impressive. I wouldn't recommend this place for big groups. When my friend had made the reservation for us, and they said the limit was 5 -- that seemed to make sense. The environment is intimate, cozy and there is a lot of noise.\n\nThe place itself is nice, I love the decor... it's warm woods, make it sexy and the way that it opens up into the hotel is nice. It doesn't close you off from the hustle and bustle that is the Bellagio... and ultimately, that is Vegas.\n\nWhere I run into trouble is the actual menu itself. It's kind of boring. The food, I feel is art here. But more like paint running down a wall. I was uninspired and slightly sober... so I still hold true to that. And that is the point of Vegas, if you eat more than you drink... something is to be said. So ultimately, you don't get your fix.\n\nThere was a wide array at the table. Lobster tacos were $22, and came into very small finger size tacos served on a metal rack. Pizza was tapas size which ran $18. Kobe Sliders with Fries runs $25. Filet runs $50 with no sides. For myself, I ordered like an anorexic -- because I had just swallowed a buffet earlier in the day. I did the Fried Mac n' Cheese which was delectable and the Cucumber Essence martini was great. Total of that $24. And in true Vegas fashion, somehow $60 escaped me at this place.\n\nAll in all, I might come back. If I can let go of my inner fat girl and not surrender to my natural gluttony. Because, when I sit down to eat... I don't expect to feel helpless looking at the food coming out... I expect to feel slightly satisfied.
