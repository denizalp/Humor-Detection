The first time my mother brought home 'what a bagel', I asked her \"why don't you buy a whole bag from the grocery store for like 3x less $?\" then I took a bite and my life was changed. The bagels... they are magic!!! How did they make it so amazing? Did they sell their soul to the devil for this delicious, crispy but doughy, warm delicious bread with a hole?! Goodness sakes.\n\nThis is my first visit into the actual store instead of begging my mom to constantly bring home bagels so I can wake up happy. This location is pretty big with a restaurant part & a take out part. Of course, me rushing to school, went to the take out part and got my favourite bagel - the pumpernickel (which I didn't know was pumpernickel and had to refer to it as 'the brown one', which got a chuckle from the lady.) The transaction went smoothly and the ladies working were nice, even though I know they are quite tired, working in the breakfast industry with hungry and grumpy customers in the morning. There are many different flavours of cream cheese and I settled on the dill one, which was delicious. I know my family is obsessed with the regular western cream cheese and even bring it home all the time. The quality of the food they offer is just spectacular. \n\nPs. shoutout to all the lost sesame seeds that fell on the floor in the transaction of the bagel going into customer's brown bags.. those poor guys never had a chance.
