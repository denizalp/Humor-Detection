OK, I like eating here.  Sometimes, I need a Chinese food fix, and this place is close to my apartment, so I stop in to get Chinese.  Panda Express is the fast food of Chinese, and honestly, its not half bad.  This location is actually one of the nicer ones I've been to, which is an added bonus.\n\nI like it here because they have a nice selection of dishes, and I can walk in and order just about anything.  They let you sample dishes if your not sure your going to like it, which is nice.  Colorful interior, reasonable prices, and you get quite a bit of food and its actually kinda good.  \n\nThe downside, is well, I guess part of the territory.  Every time I come here there's a line.  Sometimes its one or two people, other times its like 9 or 10.  If your starving, that seems like a long line!  (maybe I shouldn't wait so long to feed myself.  LOL)  Service speed is okay, nothing to complain about.  Tables are always clean, supplies are well stocked.\n\nParking is tight here.  There's a few spots, but the lot also doubles as the drive thru line, which BLOWS.  Why? If it's busy, you get blocked in by drive through people, and it takes forever to get out.  Why they did it like this makes no sense to me.  Also, they do not serve crab Rangoon.  I am baffled by this.  They have cheese Rangoon, but NEVER crab.  I prefer crab! I know, I know, my problem and not theirs.\n\nI've never done the drive through, but overall this place is not bad at all!  It beats McDonald's and Taco Bell, though slightly more expensive, comparatively speaking.  Plus, if you suddenly crave Chinese but don't trust the Chinese restaurants around you (like me) then this place is a safe bet!
