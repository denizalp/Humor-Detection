Just Ok.\n\nIts a cute little place. Looks retro but that's pretty much it. These cupcakes are sooooo sweet. Good cupcakes don't mean more sugar. The frosting amount is overkill. You can't taste the actual cupcake with out getting a huge dollop of frosting.  I took frosting off to really taste the actual cupcake and I felt silly I paid so much for four! They are way too expensive. \n\nThis is the second time I come here, I really wanted to like this place and had to prove myself it wasn't a bad batch I had last time.
