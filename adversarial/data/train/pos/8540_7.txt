I was intrigued by all this talk of the salad room. I had to check it for myself.\n\nI thought the interior atmosphere was quite nice, a little dated but nice.\n\nI decided I would try the Salad Room. (see pics)\nWhile I was impressed with the Salad Room itself, the contents were mostly things I wouldn't  care to eat, not even sure what some of the stuff was.\n I only made one trip and ate only half of that, And the Little Debbie Pinwheel wasn't one of them.\n\nEverything looked and tasted too institutional if you know what I mean. \n\n Maybe you don't.....\n\nOK how about looking around and seeing waiters coming out of the kitchen serving plates with those plastic lids over them(they really did)......I Just got taken back to the convalescent home I used to visit my great grandmother in during dinner hour.......blech......I've never seen those lids used in a restaurant?\n\nI really just got grossed out while eating there, maybe it was the guy next to me me having the all you can eat fish and chips with his little jar and spoon of cocktail sauce that was served to someone else after he left I don't know, but I do know I wont be going back.
