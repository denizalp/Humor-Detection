Without a doubt a 'cute' shop with friendly service provided by a young lady named Brenda it was just after 7:00pm when I walked into the small store and with a short line fronted by a woman and her daughter planning a 'Sweet 16' party I spent some time perusing the items and chatting with other customers, seemingly each with a different favorite amongst the store's nearly twenty options.  Featuring plated desserts, custom cakes, jars, cookies, and other take-home treats it was with an eye on variety that I ordered when I approached the front of the line and self-selecting a few favorites along with two selections confirmed by Brenda to be as good as the crowd had suggested I made my way to the door immediately indulging in a buttery cinnamon-laced snickerdoodle with crispy edges and a soft center, the first of a half dozen +1 items tallying $25 after tax and tip.  Showing some restrained and retaining the rest of my purchase for the twenty-seven minute drive home it was with coffee in hand that I continued my tasting first with a bananas-foster-esque cupcake that was plenty moist but somewhat marred by overly sweet frosting but moving on to the dense peanut butter blondie things improved substantially, the dense square loaded with rich chocolate tones and roasted organic peanut butter, a classic combo only improved after a minute on a warm skillet.  Moving finally to what has seemingly become LoVullo's 'signature' item, it was with a quartet of macarons that I rounded out my evening and with each palm-sized cookie featuring a characteristic crackle over rich flavors, the texture of the crmb was actually far more dense than the Parisian classic - a moist cake-like consistency akin to the American whoopie pie and although perhaps not 'traditional,' entirely delicious - both the dense chocolate dipped Snickers and rich, savory Fig and Goat Cheese \"Whooparons\" undoubtedly justifying the nearly hour-long round trip...though if they ever decide to expand I definitely see a market for a second shop in ever trendy Summerlin.
