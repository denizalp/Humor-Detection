So I was starving after my Moksha Yoga class on a random Sunday afternoon, when I decided to run in here and get myself a cream cheese bagel. \n\nThe server prepared my toasted bagel while eating a cheesy sandwich. When I looked at her with disgust and shock, she was exceptionally indifferent. She even had the HIDEOUS strand of cheese hanging from her lips when she set the bagel on the counter. \n\nGross.
