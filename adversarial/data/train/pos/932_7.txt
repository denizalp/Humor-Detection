This visit to Jackie Bee was a bit disappointing compared to our first visit about a year ago.\n\nWe arrived just before they opened on a Sunday and waited for them to open. Service was still warm and friendly, but the drinks weren't as good this time around. We were unable to enjoy their boba because it was still cooking and wouldn't be ready for another 17 minutes, which they kindly informed us about as we were ordering. I ordered the Caramel Milk Tea and the husband ordered the Taro Smoothie.\n\nThe Caramel Milk Tea tasted slightly watered down and had a coffee taste to it. It was good, but not what I expected for a Caramel Milk Tea. My husband said his smoothie was more slushy rather than creamy smoothie. Nonetheless, he said it was perhaps one of the best tasting \"taro\" drinks that he has had of the numerous taro drinks he's tried. In all, the service is much better than the drinks (this time).
