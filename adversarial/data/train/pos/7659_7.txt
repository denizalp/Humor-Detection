This is a hard review!\n\nThe good:  service was fast, customer service was excellent.  Our waitress was a true gem!  \n\nThe bad:\nThe table was sticky and so was the menu.\nI had hair in my cole slaw that wasnt mine.\nThe BBQ sandwich has two separate bones.\n\n I am willing to try again, maybe.  Just not anytime soon.
