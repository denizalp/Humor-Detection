Man, this place has got style and history going for it. It's been refurbished, but righteously, so all those classic mid-century touches (think: clean lines, low-rise, fab colors) still are present and accounted for.\n\nBack in the '50s, this was evidently the \"in\" spot for the well-heeled set. Imagine Bing Crosby and Tony Curtis. Ted Williams and Roy Rogers. Janet Leigh. They were all here in full swing, like something out of a Shag (http:\/\/www.shag.com\/gallery.html) painting.\n\nWhen I popped in last night, the place was sadly not in motion (it was a Tuesday night), but you could still get a sense of the vibe. Caf√© Zuzu is their bar, complete with retro booths and counter-style seating, and there's seating by the o-shaped pool. Trader Vic's is also connected to the hotel, and while you might not spot Harry Belafonte (http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=6AjovHGK-TA) hanging around, I can see how the tiki appeal works its way in (I think the Scorpion Bowls and Navy Grogs help with that as well!).\n\nI'm actually staying at the serene Firesky ( which is itself so far fantastic) during my visit to Old Town Scottsdale, but I gotta say, I'm definitely hip to the Ho next time around!
