Great first impression as the hotel airport shuttle picked me up within 10 mins from my call. Then when we got to the hotel, it was a fast and friendly check-in despite there being a line at reception. Also props to reception for prompt service when I requested extra hangers and asked them to correct my clock (it hadn't caught up to the change in daylight savings time yet).\n\nPros:\n- Breakfast in the mornings was great. \n- My bed was super comfy. It was quiet - I'm a light sleeper and wasn't disturbed at all. \n- Great (although very small - only 4 machines!) Gym. \n- Shower pressure was lovely and oh my, hot water was excellent! \n\nCons:\n- I do think cleanliness could be better. I came back in the evening and saw the bathroom wasn't that cleaned. \n- A co-worker also complained that she had holes in her towels. \n- Another co-worker found her fridge had been turned off and the food she had kept there was thrown away\n- The thing that I didn't like as much was that hangar bar was so low, my work dresses couldn't be hung straight and were crumpled towards the hemline.. however that could be b\/c I was in the dis-abelled room?\n\nI really like the location - so close to the great Ditka's restaurant and also discovered via local Yelper Phil G that this location was used in the first Jack Reacher movie - just around the corner, that Pep Boys store was converted into the car parts store where Tom Cruise's character tracks down the gal who accused him of misconduct. So that was pretty cool and since overall I had a good stay, I plan to use this hotel again. \n\nYelp Review 72\/2018
