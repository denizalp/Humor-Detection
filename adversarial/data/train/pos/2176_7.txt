I am currently addicted to hummus, and it's all because of Pita House! If I end up in hummus rehab, I am sending them the bill!\n\nIt had been ages since I had eaten any Mediterranean food, close to a decade. When I was in high school, a good friend's parents owned a Mediterranean\/Greek cafe that I ate at often but after they closed due to medical issues, I never really found a replacement to get my Greek on. \n\nPita House is that replacement. From the deliciously zesty tabouli to the juicy chicken kabobs to the addictive hummus... everything is made fresh, even the pita bread (which is amazing)! After my first visit to Pita House, I would get the most intense cravings for their hummus and I have yet to find a place that has anything quite as good as what PIta House serves up.\n\nThe restaurant itself is simple but it has always been very clean when I have gone in. The staff have always been extremely pleasant and helpful. There have been times I have gone months between visits, however the employees always seem to remember me and great me warmly. \n\nIn a nutshell: Pita House has some super friendly employees serving up super super yummy food that is actually good for you AND will not break the bank. As far as I am concerned, for Mediterranean food in Las Vegas, Pita House is as good as it gets!
