If you like runny eggs, uncooked ham and frozen hash browns, you'll love the \"Home of the Breakfast Explosion\".\n\nI ordered their Benedict and a side of pancakes, and what I got was something that anyone could slap together without attention to detail.  It is beyond me why this is on the menu if you just can't cook it!\n\nTo be fair, and the only reason this noisy, poorly ventilated place did not get a single star was because our waitress was just so nice to us, trying to compensate for a crew that should just stick to pancakes, waffles and french toast.\n\nSpecial tip: if you're coming here, keep the ordering to just waffles and french toast; get your coffee at the Coffee Roaster next door and you'll survive.
