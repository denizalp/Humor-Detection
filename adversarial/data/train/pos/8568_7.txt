It was a typical day hot summer day, when I found the little Sasapops stand at the entrance of the Las Vegas outlet mall. How can you say no to a refreshing popsicle? Like really? \n\nWell you can't. Give them 4 bucks and they'll hand you a refreshing treat to help you cool off. Sure, $4 is kind of pricey for just a regular fruit popsicle, but hey its called supply and demand. I get that and I don't blame them for it. When I was there they had at least eight flavors-- strawberry, mango, pineapple, coconut, chocolate, watermelon, etc. I opted for a mango and my friend had the watermelon. Both flavors were delicious and were so cold they didn't melt right away. \n\nOh, and they are organic, natural, preservative free, yadda yadda. That's always a plus, right? But when its well over a hundred degrees, who really cares what's in it as long as its ice cold.
