Matt G is in Phoenix, AZ and I'm sweating like a pig in this desert-heat! Yeah, many of you thought the Bay Area was hot, why don't you come down here and compare for yourself... HMMM!?!\n\nSouthwest Airline introduced an internet special for certain domestic flights to certain cities. Earlier in the month, I booked a non-stop flight from Oakland International Airport to Sky Harbor International Airport in Phoenix for $69.00 one way and another $69.00 to comeback. Including the necessary fees and other BS, the total comes to nearly $200.00. My flight was supposed to leave Oakland at 11am. But for some uncanny reason, the flight had a 10 minute delay; therefore we left quarter after 11am. Despite leaving later than the supposed time, my flight landed smoothly in Phoenix a little after 2pm (Arizona time).\n\nThe airport is nicer and quieter than three Bay Area airports. I'm just going to be here for a couple of days. Unlike the airports from home, Downtown Phoenix is just walking distance or a light-rail ride from the airport. So renting a car is not necessary if you are only here for a short time. There are restaurants in the airport. But screw that; I'm going to Downtown and find a restaurant to seriously eat and feed yelp some reviews.
