I saw this divalicious show this weekend, I have seen drag shows before, but I knew them so the experience was different.\n\n We arrive at the theater and was surprised to see how cozy and comfortable the venue was. Once the show started, the set was incredible.\n\n\n Frank Marino's Divas Las Vegas was fantastic. I saw the likes of Tina Turner, Liza Minnelli, Brittney Spears, (who I thought for a second they were trying to pass a woman off as a man in drag, That is how amazing he was) Celine Deon, (who was also amazing) Diana Ross, Whitney Huston, Tina Turner, Cher, Lady Gaga, Dolly Parton, Madonna, and Bette Midler. Those I remember. I love, love, loved it. The dancers were awesome.\n\n Frank Marino had so many fantastic costume changes and was so very funny. He did Joan Rivers as well. All the costumes were amazing! I loved them. This is one not to be missed. I enjoyed it completely. Truly a drag show to see! The end scene with the man change was incredible. See it!!
