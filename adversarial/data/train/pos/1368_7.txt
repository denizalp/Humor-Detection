I love Nacho Daddy but I wish their fish and chip ( I substituted for rice) meal was bigger. They give you all the wonderful lemony sauce but not enough fish to dip in there. I've only been here twice but every time I go I can't say no to the elote. Elote is corn smothered in mayo, Mexican cheese, lemon and spiciness. It sounds like a weird combo but I love it! \n\nThe servers are always awesome and they come by to make sure you are doing well. We came in with a mailer that the server had never seen instead of brushing us off he had the manager go ahead and fix the bill to honor the mailer. \n\nI also like the idea when we were seated music videos were on that I haven't seen in a while like MC Hammer Can't touch this. I personally prefer music videos over sports any day! I would like to come during brunch and try their Bloody Marys soon!
