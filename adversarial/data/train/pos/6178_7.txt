Do you go to this gym? Do you go there and hop on a treadmill then walk 2 mph holding onto the rail at a high incline thus negating all the benefits of that high incline by holding onto the rails? \n\nDo you take a friend to do this right beside you? Do you guys then talk loud as hell about stupid $h*t a perfect stranger has no business hearing? Loud enough for me to hear you through my headphones streaming a tv show with my volume turned up as loud as it will go? \n\nYou are a horrible person. Don't do that. It's so, so rude. To the staff there: try a quiet treadmill area please. I go there and try to just workout with my earbuds in and leave and it drives me so, so crazy when people do this.
