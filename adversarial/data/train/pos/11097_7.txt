If crappy is cool than why aren't 3rd World countries flooded with hipsters?, I went to this spot because a band I liked was playing (smile empty soul) The plaza it's located in is shady. They took the name and literally applied it. The crowd that night was a mix of hipster douche, along with frat boy mc douchenstein . There's a pretty cute bartender among the gargoyles. Drinks are fairly cheap service was kinda slow even though they weren't busy. It's a relatively small space so when it gets crowded it's kinda shoulder to shoulder. The PA system was pretty good. The set changes were pretty quick. I probably wouldn't frequent this joint unless there was an event i really admired going on.
