first let start out by saying i will never stay at this establishment ever again with how we were treated when we stayed there from aug 16th - aug 22nd of 2014\n\nit started on sunday when my girlfriend started waking up with bites on her legs and ankles and feet then just went from there. \nthey kept coming more and more each day and to no avail till tuesday when she couldn't make it to work for the trade show we were up there for she finally went to the hospital to have the bites checked out. it ended up being bed bugs in which if you look it up there is 34 now 35 claims of bedbugs  at this establishment in the last year with nothing being done...they said they will have eco lab do a test on the room and it came back with no results of there being bed bugs  but when we asked for a copy of the report they said it was an internal issue and we could not have a copy of the report...in my eyes they are trying to hide the truth by not giving me a copy of the report. we left that thursday the 22nd and had to get all of our personal belongings and all my salesmen samples dry cleaned at my own expense and now have a sample bill for all my samples being as we turn them in to be put back in inventory to be sold now being as they were dry cleaned we can no longer do that....my vehicle also had to be professionally detailed to make sure the contamination did not spread to it when we arrived back home as well. \n\nthere only thing they offered us was tuesday night after my girlfriend came back from the hospital which we also paid at our own expense and her loss of wages for missing work while being at the hospital was an upgrade to a suite which at this point was ridiculous at this point we just wanted to leave but we still had work to be done the following 2 days up there...they also were to refund stuff to my cc on file which at first it was going thru then 2 days after we arrived back home the money was taken back out of my account...we have tried to resolve this issue with them before having to contact a attorney but they will not take phone calls from either myself of my girlfriend which in my eyes is horrible customer service and just down right wrong in my eyes...\n\nnow almost 3 weeks later we are out for loss of wages, 2 completes salesmen sample lines and garment bags that cannot be taken back to resell and a complete detail on my personal vehicle due to not wanting it to spread to my personal vehicle and hospital bills that they do not want to compensate us for anything at all for any of it nothing...all in all upwards of over $10000 dollars out of pocket and nothing being done on there behalf and this is a mgm establishment to top it off...\n\ni have stayed at numerous hotels in my lifetime in las vegas and this by far was the worst experience ever in staying someplace in las vegas...not even old hotels in vegas are this bad....as you can google bed bugs reports and claims and they are the worst in vegas at this point...who wants to come to vegas to end up getting bit up and have to spend time in the hospital instead of actually either working on having a vacation like your there for...\n\nso to end all of this i wish i could give this report negative stars in stead of the one i gave them but it is not possible to do so..so whom ever in the near future thinks about staying at this hotel beware of the bed bugs as they are in this establishment and they will do nothing for you other then give you a suite for the tenure of your stay in a contimated hotel in which they say isnt but wont provide test results to anyone who has made claims of it...
