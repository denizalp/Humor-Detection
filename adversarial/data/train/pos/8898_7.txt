Beware!!!!!  There is no alcohol in their cocktails.I got a mojito and it did not have any alcohol in it.When I asked to order another one with more alcohol, they said I need to pay extra to get more alcohol.I just wanted to get regular mojito, not like this all ice and water one.When I talked to the manager , she told me she is sorry, she can not do anything , it is the company policy.I think they should write on the menu, because of our company policy our drinks  does not contain any alcohol...
