Pretty photo op in the Forum shops.  Stop by in between all that fantastic window shopping or on your way to the Fall of Atlantis show a bit further down in the mall.   A good place to sit for a few minutes and marvel at the ceiling\/changing sky above you...  Maybe have a coffee here and relax a bit.
