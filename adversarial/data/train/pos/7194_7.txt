Ok so this gym reeks of B.O. Probably because of the age group of their clientele (young guys)... It's also quite small compared to other locations and way more packed with people.\n\nSome of their machines don't work very well (weights get stuck as you try to use the machines in the circuit area).\n\nI guess that's what you get for the price. I have a platinum membership since January 2018, and trust me, it's 1\/2 the price of some other gyms downtown. \n\nI like the massage chairs and the fact that it has a young vibe but a little more maintenance would go a long way. Wish they provided indoor parking at the Atwater location!!\n\nAlso the fact that it's on top of the Forum cinema gives me mad cravings for popcorn and fried foods after a good workout!
