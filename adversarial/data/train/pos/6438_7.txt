Their menu is simple with a great selection of Greek specialties and food that's just good for you. The first section is appetizers; Spreads (Greek spreads are so much more than just Hummus and Tzatziki!) and classics like Spanakopita and Dolmadakia (Stuffed Grape Leaves). I like to order the Mezze Plate ($12.79) with Spanakopita, Tzatziki, Hummus, Falafel, Dolmadakia, Marinated Olives, Tomato Salad, and Pita. It's a fantastic way to get a little taste of everything, especially when you can't decide! I would love to try all their spreads next time since I'm a fan of Taramasalata and Melizanosalata (roasted eggplant spread similar to Baba Ganoush, but without tahini); you can get a combination of all five spreads for $21.95.\n\nThe second section is basically three dishes:\nMeraki Signature Bowl ($9.49)\nClassic Greek Salad ($6.49\/$8.79)\nVillage Greek Salad ($7.49\/$9.49)\n\nThe difference between the Classic Greek and the Village Greek salads is the absence of lettuce in the latter, which is more common in Greece. The salads are loaded with tomato, red onion, cucumber, feta cheese, Kalamata olives, pepperoncini, and Greek vinaigrette; plus, grilled pita (I got Tzatziki with mine as well). The signature bowl comes with a choice of Greek Rice or Aegean Quinoa and its elements are the same as the salads with the addition of arugula, marinated garbanzo beans, sliced red radish, and Tzatziki. Very hearty!\n\nThere are eleven add-on options with four Vegetarian options. I've tried the Pork Kalamaki ($3.49), Shrimp Kalamaki ($4.49), and Grilled Salmon ($6.95). Kalamaki is a synonym of Souvlaki (used primarily in Southern Greece), but essentially are the grilled meat skewers. Everything I've had is delicious. I really enjoyed the salmon on their Classic Greek Salad as it was light, yet filling. It's a dish I could eat over and over.\n\nThe third section has sandwiches (gyros, burgers) and platters\/plates. I've had the Gyro Meraki ($7.95) with beef\/lamb, tomato, lettuce, red onion, Tzatziki, and feta cheese; and the Gyro Plate ($12.95) with Greek Rice or Fries, Greek salad, pita, and Tzatziki. I love gyro meat (the famous beef\/lamb spit) and both are great options; they're essentially the same, so it just depends on my mood. I've had my eye on their Lamb Burger and I'm determined to try it on my next visit.\n\nFor desserts, I absolutely love the Baklava Ice Cream ($3.95)! It's Baklava mixed into vanilla ice cream for the perfect treat. Although it's not on the menu, they serve Greek coffee and it is amazing. It's in Espresso format (very small) and I like it sweetened. It transports me back to Greece!\n\nThey offer daily specials that are indicated on a 8x10\" display at the registers. I've seen Lavraki (Mediterranean Sea Bass) and steak sandwiches. The most popular special has been their Grilled Octopus ($17.49). It's been served in a couple different ways and it's availability is random, but if it's there when you are, definitely order it. When I had it, there was a Greek-style White Bean Salad that was a nice accompaniment, but the octopus was great on its own. The owner told me that specials are usually offered during dinner since they want to keep service quick during the day, however, I have seen the specials during lunch on weekends.\n\nI am thrilled to have Meraki close to home and I am loving all of it. It does tend to get really busy during lunch, but it moves quickly. The service is amazing, too!
