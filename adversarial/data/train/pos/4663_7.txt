Damn Monte Carlo, ok, I see you flipping the script. (Okay, I know it's called Park MGM or whatever now, but it may as well be called Stella, because this place really got its groove back.)\n\nBavette's is quickly becoming one of my favorite steakhouses on the strip. If you take anything from this review, remember these two words: BONE. MARROW.\n\nBavette's has one of the best marrow appies I've had in AGES. \n\nI went to Bavette's several months ago (January 2018) and was blown away by every single thing we ordered. I was raving about it for weeks actually.\n\nNow, since I'm living that keto life, you know I have HIGH standards for steakhouses. Bavette's definitely makes the cut. (Hehe, see what I did there?)
