From the looks on the outside, you think nope, no and no thanks but if you dare to venture in you'll find that the food is moderately decent and not weighted down with extras that make you feel bloated and hating yourself. The buffet for me is always a no go because I know some people do not wash their hands and have no consideration for others who are using utensils after them. If you're in the area you will probably enjoy the meal but the decor has left feeling like I'm taking a chance each time I eat.
