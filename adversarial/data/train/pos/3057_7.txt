I decided to give Du-par's a try.  I arrived for an early dinner at 4:23.  I know that because one of the promotions going on for a limited time is to pay for certain meals an amount that is equivalent to the time you arrive between four and six.  There are 5 selections and you a required to buy a drink.  The choices aren't things I normally get.\n\nAnother limited time promotion is 50% off when you pay with slot club points, any day, any time of the day.\n\nI had been to Du-par's in the Golden Gate but I was never blown away by supposedly having the best pancakes in the world.  I looked over the menu and decided on their chicken pot pie.  I was brought the iced tea I ordered quickly and a short time later the pot pie arrived.\n\nA bit different in shape, this was oblong in a boat shaped dish.  There was a good number of chicken pieces, randomly cut.  The pieces weren't identical cubes.  The sauce was fine.\n\nPies are the thing that Du-par's does well and there's a wide selection.  For dessert, I had coconut cream pie, something I hadn't had in a long time.\n\nThe meal was OK, service was good, and the 50% off made the $15+ price palatable--no pun intended.  I'd return for a sandwich or just some pie but this isn't a place that I'd make a regular stop unless I was at the Suncoast.
