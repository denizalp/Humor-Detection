Blackjack table robbed you? Payed the $100 cover to the nightclub the night before? Spent all your money on that one stripper? Earl of Sandwich FEELS YOU and is HERE FOR YOU.\n\nThis place is just a sandwich spot. The reason it gets a 5 is because it does what it does well. Sandwiches are roughly 6 bucks and these sandwiches are GOOD. If Yelp doesn't persuade you, the long line to order will. These people aren't waiting in line for Subway sandwiches. \n\nMy go-to sandwich is the FULL MONTAGUE. All ingredients are quality and fresh. They have a bunch of sides you can pick up with your sandwich that are also quality and fresh. It's not the best sandwich that I've ever had, but it's muhfuggin up there. \n\nI always come here when I visit Vegas. If you're not ballin and want some good food, make your way to Earl.
