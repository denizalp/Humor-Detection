This hotel is amazing!! I've stayed here a couple of times, and love the rooms and location. My favorite part is that the rooms have a balcony, and if you're lucky, you get a room facing the Bellagio fountains!! The view is beautiful during the day and at night!\n\nThe only thing is that I feel like all the rooms are centered around the shower. It's designed for a couple, cause the showers are very open and have windows that look into the bedroom or the balcony. It makes sharing a room with friends a little difficult lol. And the bathroom doors don't lock, just FYI. \n\nAnd check out Secret Pizza and Holsteins while you're there!
