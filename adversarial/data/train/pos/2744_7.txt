Sunday morning 2\/6\/11 waited over an hour they cut 3 peoples hair in that time as I watched 7 people leave with out getting a hair cut and the two girls working the place never pulled it out of first gear.  They acted annoyed people were coming in.  I will never be back and I wish I ran a business making so much money they could stand to see people walk out in droves.
