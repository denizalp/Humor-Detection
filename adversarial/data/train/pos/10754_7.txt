Simply Amazing.  After the worst move experience ever last year w\/ Gateway movers (DO NOT USE EVER), El Cheap was positively dreamy.  Uber professional, they followed up multiple times, gave me helpful tips and were very very reasonable with prices.  They even called morning of to let me know they were headed over and were incredibly prompt arriving at 8:59 AM (my move was scheduled for 9AM).  The actual movers themselves were very friendly and super fast and got the job done in less time than it takes to make a customer service call to Rogers.  They accept cash and credit, and also allow tipping to be done via credit which is awesome. I would recommend them to anyone  looking for a painless, professional move.
