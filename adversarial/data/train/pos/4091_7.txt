If there was an option for a 0\/5 stars this place would have earned it. I ordered my food with no line and no other customers only to wait 20 minutes to find out that my\nOrder won't be ready for another 25 minutes, I asked to see a manager and was greeted 5 mins later with the money I had used to purchase the meal, without so much as a word from the manager. 0 stars for sure.
