I'm not sure how this place got a 4 star. I'm very picky when it comes to pho. Maybe that's the Viet in me or the fact that nothing compares to my mom's pho. \n\nThis place has horrible service. Which is unfortunate since the food is pretty decent. It took us 20+ minutes just to get some water and menus. When we got our menus they wanted to take our orders right away, on the spot. Um can I look at my menu first? \n\nI ordered the rice with BBQ pork. So com suon nuong. Yummy. My family ordered pho. By the time they got their dishes I was already done with mine. My Thai tea had more ice in it than actual Thai tea. If it wasn't for my family I'd never come back here.
