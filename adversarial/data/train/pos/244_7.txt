Warning - this food caused vomiting and back end explosions after eating.\n\nOrdered some BBQ for take out last night. This morning, all three of us in the house are sick as hell.  The food was well below average, I've microwaved pulled pork from the Costco freezer section that tasted better and had more flavor. Sweet Potatoes were good but only because of the massive amount of cinnamon and butter - the potatoes itself was way overcooked and mushy like baby food.\n\nDaughter ordered the brisket plate. It was \"ok\". Very dry and tasteless. Pretty sure it was actual beef, just not quality beef. Lucky for her getting sick from it means she got to taste it twice. Both times were horrible to her. She ordered a chili which of course never made it in to the bag so I'll have to guess and say its equally horrible.\n\nWife ordered the burnt ends dinner - was mostly big chunks of solid fat any chunks of actual meat found tasted like it had been sitting on the counter for 2 days before being served to us. The coleslaw? WTF? This tasted like no coleslaw I've ever eaten in my life. It was basically old cabbage chopped up and tossed in vinegar. Not very appetizing so it was thrown out after one bite.\n\nI ordered the potato skins and the sliders. Meh, skins were ok, kind of greasy but thats to be expected when you pile pork and cheese on a potato . Sliders were dry, nothing but bun, meat, and some poor excuse for a BBQ sauce. Literally tasteless and dry. Sadly not equally tasteless while leaving my system.\n\nI'd write more but I am off to my fourth trip to the restroom to let the garbage we were served last night continue to evacuate my system.  In Vegas at 4AM you are not supposed to be hugging your toilet, you are supposed to be out having fun. Ugh NEVER AGAIN.\n\nThere are enough good BBQ places in Vegas near me that I'll never try this place again.
