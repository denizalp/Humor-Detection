Encore Beach Club is beautiful, the perfect weather made it even better for a pool party. The decor and layout of this place is trendy, truly feels like what a beach club should feel like. You could still get around even if you don't have a cabana because there is a pretty spacious dance floor, but being a girl in Vegas, we always somehow made our way in either a booth or cabana.  It's busy whenever there is a big DJ playing, but like I said, it's isn't too hard to get around.
