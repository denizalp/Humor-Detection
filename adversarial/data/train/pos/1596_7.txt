Short and simple.\nIt's all about the ambiance and the atmosphere, baby! \n\nLike many have mentioned, this is old school Vegas. The superficiality, the glitz and glam of all those other prestigious restaurants on the strip....you can forgit-about-it!!! It's always good to go back in time and enjoy what Vegas was once all about.\n\nFood was delicious. (Of course it was...wouldn't expect anything less from a fine establishment like this.) One really cool thing they do here is that they make certain foods in front of you. We ordered a Cesar Salad and it was a fun experience to watch them prepare it for us. Ordered steak and shrimp scampi as our entrees, we were blissfully satisfied.\n\nAlso...they lit desserts on fire??!! Seriously. It looks cool to watch but we were so full from our dinner...I couldn't stomach anymore food. Maybe I'll just come here for dessert another time?\n\nDefinitely check this place out!
