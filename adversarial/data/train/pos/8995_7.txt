This place was PACKED. We went late and kind of on a whim and so had to pay $20 cover but whatever. Literally, though, pressing your way through all those bodies was stressful. I thought the size and different levels were cool but I wasn't nearly drunk enough to enjoy it all. \n\nThe dance floor was a nightmare. Don't get me wrong, I had a good time, but there were SO MANY BODIES. And a couple incidents. Like some nearby rando definitely snuck his hand under my skirt and then smirked to his friend about it. And I got cornered by this black guy who wanted to do the most ridiculous dancing ever. On that note, if it weren't for the creepers\/crowd the dance floor would have been my favorite in Vegas so far. There were crazy lights and if I remember correctly maybe even bubbles floating down from time to time. That and I was really feeling the music. \n\nBy the end of the night, though, I was so exhausted and delirious from my aching feet that when this guy walked up to us minutes after we left I immediately snapped \"What did you say?\" when in fact he hadn't said anything at all yet, even though I would swear to this day that he had. He was all butt-hurt and walked away and I didn't even have the energy to feel bad about it. LOL oh well. Then outside the hotel some short a-hole named Amillion (I kid you not) spent like 20 minutes hitting on me\/trying to get me to come back to his room at the STRATOSPHERE. Yeahhhh I'll pass on that buddy. \n\nOverall: \nDancing + Music + Venue = yes\nCreepers inside + Creepers outside + TOO MANY PEOPLE = no thanks\n\nBut worth a visit if you ask me.
