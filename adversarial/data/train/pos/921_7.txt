Almondcado.....not a familiar combination you'd see anywhere, but what that name fails to mention is that blueberries are also included in this very delicious smoothie(man, the blueberries are good for you too, but they must be feelin' hella butt hurt not being part of the smoothie's name!?) along with almond milk and avocados.\n\nANY WAY......A bunch of us braved the heat and came out for the grand opening of For Goodness Shake, a new shake\/smoothie\/sweet shop located just across the LVAC on Flamingo and 215. \"Indulge with a purpose\" is their mission statement which is great because for every shake or smoothie purchased, a child gets a meal through Three Square Food Bank, a great way to help the less fortunate in our community.\n\nPerusing the menu, the shakes screamed one thing....SUGAR. that made my teeth cringe reading the topping selections(candies, cookies, cereals, etc.), so I looked over to the smoothies side, and I love avocado anything, so I went with the Almondcado which was nice and thick, and had just the right sweetness. As the evening went on, more people came, and their soft serve supply for their shakes and smoothies got depleted in no time.\n\nThat's where it kinda went downhill....more base was poured into the machines but didn't have sufficient time to do its thing and freeze to the right consistency. Shakes were runny, lines were still long and I overheard that the shakes were on the too sweet side, and some needed a water chaser. Even worse, some ended up getting a stomach ache\nbecause of the unfrozen soft serve...Yikes!\n\nLuckily for me, I was one of the earlier customers and I chose a smoothie over a shake.\nI will return, but FYI, test their soft serve before placing your order....ALOHA!!!
