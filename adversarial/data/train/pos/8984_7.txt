Korean Ginseng Chicken Soup & Bibimbap\n\nThis is a newly opened Korean restaurant that must be specialized in Samgyetang and Bibimbap.\n\nApparently it is oversea branch from an old Korean restaurant in Seoul that has been in business for over 40 year. (I did visit the one of their location in Myeong-dong while I was in Seoul).\n\nMenu is really simple with different kind of Samgyetang soups, Soon Tofu and Bibimbaps, a lot of 10 items or so on the menu.\n\nHot Stone Raw Veal Bibimbaps ($12.99) is really tasty. The hot pot definitely is really hot as it able to cook the raw meat and made my rice crispy at the bottom. Love the mushrooms. The only complain is the portion is just so small at this price point. I can eat 2 order of that as a meal.\n\nI though will come back to give the Ginseng Chicken Soup a try! The Abalones Samgyetang and Organic Pine Mushroom Samgyetang does sounds interesting! Btw, the young chicken is locally sourced and grown Ontario chicken from Orangeville!
