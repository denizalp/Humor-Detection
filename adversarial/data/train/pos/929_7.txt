This is the new hot spot ! Hubby & I have been here a few times already & each time we have been impressed. Great food, great service. The ambiance is very hip and sleek.  The avocado toast & grilled cheese sandwich with tomato soup hit the spot last Sunday . This new restaurant has been slammed since its opening , we are excited to try more dishes & cocktails.
