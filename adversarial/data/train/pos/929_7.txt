This place is unbelievably delicious! I had the smoked salmon benedict, which was to die for....OMG, it was beyond yummy! Other folks in my party had the scrambles, french toast, and the bf had chicken and waffles.\n\nAnytime I'll be in Vegas or SD, I'll be sure to pay Hash House a visit.\n\nBe prepared to wait about an hour or so for a table because patrons will sit forever, and service is slow (due mainly to the preparation of the huge\/massive size of food).
