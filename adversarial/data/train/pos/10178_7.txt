This popular shopping plaza is another extension to the growing Asian businesses poping up around the Chinatown District. You can find a variety of delicious restaurants including Chinese, Filipino, Korean, Japanese, Vietnamese and even Mongolian. It has a decent parking lot but it can be jam packed on the weekends and holidays. A few lounges are sprinkled in the mix including the popular Q Karaoke studio and bar. A great place to take a group of friends or family for a fun foodie adventure or a night of endless singing.\n\nPro-Tip: Entering and Exiting the plaza can be a challenge and use caution because Jones Blvd. is a busy 2 way traffic street. Give your self extra time during busy days and nights when locating an open parking spot.\n\n2017 Yelp Review #86
