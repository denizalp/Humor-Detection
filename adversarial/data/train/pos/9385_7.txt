Totally worth the visit.  Make sure to exploire the tower and tunnels.  We got stuck down there beyond closing time and came back to the main entrance to find everything was locked up, almost everybody was gone, and the lights were off.  Lucky for them they let us out, because we had already selected rooms to stay in for the night.
