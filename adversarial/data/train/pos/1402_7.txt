This is a great place to go and shoot.  They have a section for handguns\/rifles, skeet, and archery.  There are a ton of lanes in each section to accomodate a lot of people and with enough room so you don't feel cramped.  They have target slots from 3 feet out to 100 feet, so you are bound to find your sweet spot somewhere in that range.\n\nIt is well staffed and the people on the range will help you with any questions you may have, including checking out your shooting stance.  I know this because I was doing it all wrong with my new handgun and a nice gentleman working there helped me correct my stance and hand position on my gun, which resulted in me getting better and my target being destroyed by my newly discovered shooting prowess!  Rambo watch out!  I think it may have helped my husband shooting as well.  \n\nThe also offer ammo and targets, in case you forgot yours, and snacks if you get the munchies on the range.  They even have pretty targets in case you aren't into boring grid ones.  I tried to get my husband to get a flower target, but alas, I lost that battle.\n\nThe place makes you feel safe too.  The people on the range watch out for everyone and make sure everyone is behaving and are doing what they are supposed too.  They are quite strict with the rules and will fuss at you if you do anything wrong, but you know it is just to keep everyone safe.  The rules aren't really too bad since you are surrounded by hundreds of people who are ARMED to the teeth! \n\nAnd for you reloaders out there, you can collect a ton of brass for pennies on the dollar, if you are interested in that sort of thing.  The park has a big table covered in brass just waiting for you to pick through it and get the caliber you want to work with.  It is on the way out, so you don't even have to lug it with you to the range.\n\nShooting is a new hobby of ours and the CCSP really makes it fun to go out and shoot stuff up.
