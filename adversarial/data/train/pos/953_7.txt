Thankfully, the owner is a good friend of mine, So i can avoid the $10 yearly membership.  Hell, if you even pay 40, 50, or 100, its still worth it.  The food items will make you dizzy.  There are so many things to buy and try.  If somehow, they can set up tasting\/sample tables for the items....the Look out costco.\n\nMy fav. is the seafood.  You can get every thing ever fished outta the ocean for whole prices.  Cant go wrong.\n\nMY how times have changed.  Even in recession ravaged vegas, this place suffers...... from great to bad in less than 12 months....
