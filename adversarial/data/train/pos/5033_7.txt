***YELP 100 CHALLENGE 45\/100***\n\nI have visited 4 times in the past 12 months, I keep waiting for my AHA moment but unfortunately all visits were just okay for me. \n\nAmong the goodies I have tried: Green tea cake, Mango and Chocolate caramel mille crepe cakes, Strawberry shortcake, chocolate cake, Strawberry Nutella Almond crepe, Chestnut Mont blanc and their various cream puffs. \n\nI can't stand super sugary desserts even though I have a penchant for sweet things, but I find the sugar factor in Suzuya's offerings lacking. Both the strawberry shortcake and green tea cake (bestsellers) fell short in my books. Flavors didn't come thru and their cream puffs although light in texture was again missing the decadence it should've had. \n\nThey have a large variety of pastries that's pleasing to the eye, presentation is top notch here but I just cant seem to bypass the lack of sweetness in their creations. I'm sure I'll be back at some point but I think 4 visits is enough for me to venture out and seek better options.
