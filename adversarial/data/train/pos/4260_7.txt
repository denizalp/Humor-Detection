STAY AS FAR AWAY as you can from this place.. It's horrible and worst of all the Tahiti Village which is a fairly nice resort right next to it recommends this crap food to its guest\/owners.. REALLY!! You can't be serious!!! \n\nThe place smells when you first walk in.. The food is horrible and I wouldn't feed it to my dog!
