Ever had Elvis, J Lo, Michael Jackson, Mariah Carey or Prince as your Blackjack dealer?? Well...ya wanna??\n\nMAN~! This place rocks like no other~! I know it's ghetto, okay? But I mean the casino...not the rooms. I've seen the rooms, and I would not stay here but in Vegas you will see me in this casino enjoying the awesome Dealertainers. These dealers\/entertainers are really talented. Everyone lets loose in this casino. Everyone is having a good time. Dancing and singing along to old school songs. It's worth checking out just for the entertainment.
