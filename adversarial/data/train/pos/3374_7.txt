Save your money, avoid this place. I would never go there again. If I could give it negative stars, I would.\n\nMy 11 year old daughter bought a Groupon for me as special treat for her Dad. I called first to make an appointment, the women who answered the phone was very short with me. I wanted to get an idea how long the appointment,  she told me that a Manicure and Pedicure would take about an hour, I did not mention that I had a Groupon on the phone.\n\nWhen I got there for my appointment, there was only one other customer in the place. I thought to myself this is going to be great, I was there to just chill and relax.\n\nYeah, that did not happen. I have never seen someone clip my toenails as fast as this women. It was not relaxing at all! On top of that, before she began, she pulled out her upsell sheet. \n\nShe actually acted like she was offended that I just wanted the basic. After my less than 10 minute pedicure, I was the only one in the place, so I thought maybe the manicure was going to be relaxing. I was wrong there too.\n\nThe women who was giving me my very fast manicure, stopped in the middle and actually answered her cell phone.\n\nI was in and out in 22 minutes. Cindy the owner was there and made the most amazing comment to me. \"You can go ahead and leave her  tip on the counter\"  the women who gave me my speed treatments was back on the phone.\n\nIt is not spotless, it is a very low quality and they really do not treat you very nice when you present a Groupon.\n\nBuyer Beware\n\nPlease drive there first and see for yourself before you ever decide to go there.\n\nYou deserve Better!
