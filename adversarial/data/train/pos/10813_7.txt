Genius. That's the word that completely describes Frank Lloyd Wright. Everything about this place is genius. Even the location is genius. \n\nThere's something here for everyone. A bit nerdy? No problem, you'll be fascinated by how FLW designed things. What looks simple is actually quite complex when you examine it closely. Into the beauty? Also no problem; he has no problem using bright colors to please the senses.. Into landscaping and the desert? Got it covered. \n\nI recommend the 90 minute guided tour for full impact.  It'll be the most peaceful and educational 1 1\/2 hours you've spent in a long time.\n\nTip: If you buy tickets online (go to their site) you can save a few dollars.
