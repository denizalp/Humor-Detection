Incredibly fresh and amazing quality! Ordered the Chu Toro sashimi, which was a steal at $13.95, and it was the BEST buttery tasting piece of raw fish I'd ever had!  Was so delicious ended up ordering 2 more orders.  Also had the Amberjack Sashimi and the quality was on point.  I'm a big fan of Naked Fish because of the quality, but Izakaya Go had fish just as fresh and high quality at a fraction of the price.\nFirefly Squid- YUM! tiny itty bitty baby squid served raw with a miso sauce.. To die for.. So amazingly fresh!\nPoke bowl had high quality tuna, Ramen Burger was savory, the pork cooked to tender perfection.  Seriously considered ordering extra noodle \"buns\" to take home with me to snack on later.  \nHuge menu selection, lots to choose from for everyone, had so many intriguing items.  \nOwner himself took the initial order, staff super friendly and accommodating, great atmosphere, comfy seating.  Honestly wish I found this place earlier.  Been going to Ichiza for years but will definitely make the switch to Izakaya Go for Japanese tapas!  \nRecommend that you go now while they're still in their initial stages of opening- this place WILL have a wait once people start realizing what a great little restaurant this is.
