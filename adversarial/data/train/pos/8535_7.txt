Krua Thai does differ from other Thai Restaurants. They offer a very large menu of many Thai Dishes including a very hard to find northern curry dish called Kang Pa Curry (jungle curry, forest curry, kaeng pa). Other ways that they differ are that portions are large and they put more meat in the dishes than other Thai Restaurants I've been too. They also make HOTTER Thai Food......I ordered Hot....Hot here might be Thai Hot at most places and they got two levels that are hotter than hot.\n\nThe atmosphere is fresh and attractive.\n\nService was very good.\n\nThey have a lot going for them but my reasons for three stars are -\nThe chicken in both dishes was dry. \nThey use very little fresh herbs and herbs are very essential to the spicy basil dish....\nBoth dishes the kang pa and the spicy basil were very granular. The texture of the sauces were strange and granular. I don't know but it seemed like instead of a fresh hot pepper they used some sort of powder....The sauces seemed like they were filled with wet powder.\n\nThis place will do in a pinch for a Thai Food Craving. Atmosphere and service are above average and they serve beer and wine.\n\nRemember HOT is maybe what other places serve as Thai Hot. I think most people want less than hot here.
