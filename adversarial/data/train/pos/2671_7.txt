I dont know why people are giving this place a low star review. Im from San Francisco and i had one hell of a time while i was in vegas.\n\nMarquee was SUPER crackin on saturday night. Maybe it was because it was the I-heart-Radio weekend but im pretty sure this club is always crackin. \n\nAfter the long wait in line (swag status if you have bottle service) you take an elevator to get into the club. Its basically as good as it gets in Marquee. There are 3 floors to explore, all unique. The floor that you get off on is the main floor which they play electro, techno, and dubstep music. The upper floor is called the \"Library\" and when i went up there, they were playing some nice oldies mixes. Theres an outside part to the club which is REALLY nice. There are tables for gambling and the Dealers were women. The bottom floor is the hip hop room and that room was  CRAZY. Girls were hot. The room was hot and crowded. Go Go dancers were hot. EVERYTHING was hot. \n\nAdvice if you're planning on going here:\n\n- GUEST LIST GUEST LIST GUEST LIST. guys, you dont want to pay 90$ for cover charge. Girls get in for free. go figure.\n- PREGAME. well this is a given for any club you go to. Drink a little before coming here cause the drinks are pricey, as in any Vegas Club. But if you're ballin and you have no problem buying rounds of drinks then go ahead.\n- if you're a guy, GIRLS GIRLS GIRLS. Make sure your Guy to Girl Ratio is GOOD. if not, then you'll probably have to wait or not even get into the club. Ive seen a group of 5 guys not get in because their ratio sucked.\n\nJust make sure to not have any worries, dont worry about how you're getting back to the hotel, dont worry about your problems back home, just DONT WORRY and you'll have an amazing time here. Its vegas. Whatever happens in Vegas stays. Or ends up on Youtube. \n\nPS: and if you do happen to wake up someplace thats not your hotel room, then congrats. Cause thats what i did. haha. Cheers!
