Al Phillips has just grown on me.  It is expensive as heck.  You can do much better on price at almost any other cleaners.  But what I like are predictability and professionalism.  My experience has been that they deliver when they say they will, and the results are consistently expert.  I have never had a belt missing, or an \"Oops, this got stained\" sign, or had the garment look like it never got dry-cleaned and I just wasted my money.  \n\nIt is also convenient at this location.  There is a drive-through, and the kids who work it tend to be really courteous and cheerful.  They can often get a quick turnaround on a garment, too, if you bring it in early enough.  They don't make you pay first as some do.  It's always clean, and does not overwhelm you with the smell of chemicals.  A fan.
