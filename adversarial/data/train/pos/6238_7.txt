The Village Green is a Classic Small Town Tavern... That's that. The Double Cheeseburger came on a soft white bun. The patties were well seasoned - something many burger joints can't seem to figure out. My burger came with American cheese. Although I could have specified Swiss or Pepper Jack - but I'm glad I didn't. The Village Green burgers sort of yearn for American Cheese. I ordered my burger medium-rare and Bazinga... It actually came medium-rare. If you follow my reviews, you understand that I'm a stickler for properly cooked burgers. Few burger joints get this right - So when they do, it's worth noting. \n\nCompanion had a Bacon Cheeseburger. She claimed it was tasty... Given companion isn't really a bacon cheeseburger sort of gal, this was high praise. Although she did enjoy it with the Classic Wisconsin cocktail, an Old Fashioned. Said cocktail may have improved  her review.
