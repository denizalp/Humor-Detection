I've been to marquee twice within four months.  On Friday nights, there's a guestlist for girls, so its pretty easy to get in.\n\nThe main floor is very spacious and has a large dance floor.  This leads out to the pool\/cabana area which gets pretty packed as well.  The hip hop room is fun, but it gets WAY too crowded.  Last time I was there, you could barely walk through, and people were getting down and dirty in the walkways...it was extremely difficult to get around in there.\n\nMarquee is the happening spot these days, but the bad part is all of the damn stairs!  Having a bunch of drunk girls in high heels walking up and down stairs is not a good idea!  I'll be back for sure, but damn those stairs!!!
