What a disappointment!  We went to check it out, we sat at one end of the bar where it looks like a large communal table.  We had a margarita and a blueberry lemon drop.  Yuck, their well liquor must be the worst I have ever had. I imagine that is what gasoline would taste like.  We could not finish those drinks.  We decided to cut our loses and leave.
