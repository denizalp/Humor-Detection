I used to like Armani Exchange a lot more than I do these days. I think I might just be getting old though... :-\/ I still can't really resist going into the store though because there often still seems to be something worth buying... ;) I found this particular AE a bit more cluttered and claustrophobic than others. It seemed like a lot of merchandise was on sale though so maybe that was the (good) reason for the clutter? We did manage to find some nice underwear on sale in the end and the employees were all super helpful :) Maybe this store just needs a little less merchandise since it's fairly small...?
