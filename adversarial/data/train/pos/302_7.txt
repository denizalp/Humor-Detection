There's something about the vibe at Maizie's that feels so comfortable. It feels retro to me... a flashback to Indiana in the late '70s - early '80s. Maybe it's the giant bowls they serve the salads in. They make me think of Pizza Hut after a softball game circa 1980. \n\nHere are some things I like best about Maizie's:\n\nThe wingless buffalo dip is deadly -- I mean that in a good way (and it should be on the late night menu). It's gotta be mostly cream cheese... how can you go wrong?!\n\nThe fries are good, but the potato cakes are frickin' awesome! Thick mounds of really yummy mashed potatoes with a hint of horseradish, barely browned on either side.\n\nThe inside out burgers are literally filled with the items described (my fave is the Feta burger - stuffed with feta cheese and sun-dried tomatoes and served with a thimble full of chipotle humus that packs a slight punch and is great on top of the burger as bizarre as that sounds)
