natt spil natt spil.. It's probably one of my favorite bars in Madison. Tucked away on the King street next to the Great Dane. I have been coming here for drinks ever since I turned 21 so like 4 years ago? (god I'm getting old). I love the ambiance. it's dark.. most of the time you can't see anything (so come here if you just want to chill on a friday night with a drink or two and don't want to put any make up on .. no one will notice lol).  there's always a DJ when I'm there which are mostly on weekends. oh and the red oriental lanterns remind me of old school Chinese movies. In terms of drinks, I like the mojito.. really well made and so refreshing, reminds me of the mojito I had from Spain. I remember I was not a fan of Yokohoma mama but I don't remember what was in it. I also like High Tea, little gingerly taste and citrusy. I also had wine a few times. I have never had their martini.. not sure why.. but that will be on my list to try next time. My friend who's also a fan of Natt spil mentioned to me their dim sum is worth a try too. However I'm a little skeptical about the authenticity dimsum at a bar in Madison.. I will reserve my dimsum cravings for the tea house in Chicago. Last but not the least, for us poor college students, the price is not your typical college bar.. average drink ranges between $7-8 which is a reason why I gave it a 4 and not a 5.
