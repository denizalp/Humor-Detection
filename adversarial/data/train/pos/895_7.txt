La fiesta WAS my place to go for Mexican because it was close and the first time I went, the food was delicious.  My 3 options around that area are El Rodeo, Taco Bell, and El Charrito.  If you have read my review for El Charrito, I would have made the extra drive.  Unfortunately it has only been recently that I first tried El Charrito so lets move on.\n\nFood isn't that bad.  A couple times were really tasty but other times it's been bland.  The chips and salsa is good if you just want to hang out at the bar and snack while sipping on a margarita (very good) or a Mexican Beer.  I would go back if I didn't feel like making the drive and I had to have Mexican at that moment.\n\nService is just fine.  I don't think the bartender \/ owner has taken a day off in his life.  He seems super serious 364 days out of the year but go in for Cinco de Mayo and it's a different story.  They give away all kinds of goodies and the night turns pretty fun extremely fast.\n\nBathrooms are good, for both movements....lol....it is Mexican, right?
