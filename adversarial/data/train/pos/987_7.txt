My husband wanted to go here after attending the Pittsburgh ComiCon.  We don't have them up in New York, and he likes to try different buffets.\n\nWe'd actually been here once before and it was incredibly busy, but I acquiesced because it was my husband's choice.\n\nAnyways. It was still incredibly busy, but the service this time was much speedier.  Our waitress was super-polite, made sure our drinks were NEVER empty, and she never let dirty plates sit too long.  The food for dinner really wasn't that great. \n\nI love to have big salads, but I felt like the choices were limited.  (Though the lettuce was decent.)  The main courses were mostly overdone.  My husband saw a little kid dipping his hand into a container of pineapple.  The Rolls were dry.  \n\nOnly thing that redeemed this review from getting 1 star - the chocolate fountain!
