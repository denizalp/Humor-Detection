A macarOn is not a macarOOn.  I learned the difference when I ventured over to this quaint French pastry shop in my neck of the woods.  Macarons are meringue-based cookies with buttercream filling; think a French Oreo, but they come in all flavors and colors. So many choices, but the pleasant young lady behind the counter helped me narrow down my selection.  I ended up leaving with the chocolate mint, lemon, chocolate, and pistachio--délicieux!  With bonafide French chefs creating these delectable works of art, Patisserie Manon also offers other treats like Black Forest cake, tarts, pain au chocolat, candies, croissants, breads, and more. I'll be back to try the bistro offerings--the quiche looks good!  à bientôt!
