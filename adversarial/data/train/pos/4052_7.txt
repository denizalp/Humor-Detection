The Henry is a great spot to go for a late night dining spot.  The big plus is that it's 24 hours so you can come here anytime during the day.\n\nI came knowing about their French Dip sandwich and Truffle Tots because so many folks have ordered it and posted pics of it on yelp.  So when I came there for a late night munch fest, it was a no-brainer that that would be what I would order.\n\nFrench Dip -- tender prime rib, melted swiss cheese, horseradish sauce & au jus\nwith truffle tater tots \nhttp:\/\/bit.ly\/11JiTeY\nThis definitely hit the spot, especially at 1am in the morning!  A nice heavy portion of hot beef and cheese and then able to soak it all in to the au jus was just great comfort food all around!  And the Truffle Tots just made it even more epic!\n\nThe Henry has definitely made my rotation of places to eat at any time of the day.  Their late night and breakfast menus are pretty solid and I would most definitely come back again.
