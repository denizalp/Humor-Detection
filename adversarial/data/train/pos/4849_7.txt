I bought these tickets without realizing it was an improv show.  For those who don't know what that means, think of the show \"Who's Line is it Anyway?\"   Except, this show has no boundaries set by the FCC to protect the kiddies.  I say that as fair warning, as it's always a bit ridiculous to hear complaints about adult shows having adult themes.  Go figure.\n\nThe cast, for the most part, was very funny.  Considering everything was being made up on the spot, it was very witty and entertaining.  The audience seemed slow to warm up to giving ideas for the cast to act out, which probably could have been amended by a more attentive wait staff.  As the show moved on though, most of the audience became more engaging, which made for some pretty bizarre, and entertaining, scenarios in the show.\n\nThere were quite a few empty seats, which could probably be attributed to the show being relatively new, and not many people knowing about it.  As I said in the beginning, I didn't even know what I was buying tickets for.  It had the word comedy in the title, and the tickets were very inexpensive from the tix4tonight booth.  Given how everything in Vegas can be overpriced, I jumped on the bargain.\n\nThe only real down side to the show is the size of the venue.  This is located in a small room above the Cabo Wabo Cantina at the Planet Hollywood Casino.  I'm used to being packed into comedy clubs like sardines, and I have to admit, more people = more laughs = more fun. \n\nI definitely recommend this show though, and suggest, if you're not typically an outgoing person, to begin drinking before you arrive.  Part of the fun is the participation.
