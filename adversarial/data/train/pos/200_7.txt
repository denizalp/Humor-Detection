I consider myself a sandwich connoisseur.  So much so, it's to the point that the missus shakes her head at how much I love the things.  But it's the sheer amount of variety that makes them appealing.\n\nSo after reading the reviews, I had to go and check this place out.\n\nI decided to be different and try the regular turkey sub, and it was really good.  Not the usual deli slabs of meat, but chunks, and it was moist and flavorful.  Perhaps a little too much lettuce, but I could adjust that, so who cares, really.  The missus got the meatball sub, and that was no slouch.\n\nAs I ate, I read through the reviews on here, and each one was a variant of the same message:\n\n\"Try the Bobbie!\"\n\"Try the Capistrami!\"\n\"Bobbie!\"\n\"Capristrami!\"\n\"Bobbie!\"\n\"Capristrami!\"\n\"Bobbie!\"\n\"Capristrami!\"\n\n\"Alright, dammit, I'll try one of the sandwiches\", I nearly cried out, but I figured that would only get me more unusual looks than I normally get, so I went up to the counter and ordered the Bobbie for dinner later tonight.\n\nHoly crap, I am a convert now.  It was like magical wood nymphs placed happiness upon my tongue.\n\nSo let me join my voice to the chorus extolling the virtues of the Bobbie, and now I feel compelled to see what the Capristrami is all about.\n\nThese are FINE sandwiches.  Well worth the trip off-Strip to sample one of these.  And prices are pretty fair, all things considered.\n\nI think I have a new haunt to get my sammich on.
