I am scared of this place. Too many loud noises and bright lights. I feel like I'm on mushrooms when I'm in here. A bad batch of mushrooms.\nThis is an all-slots casino with no hotel attached. This means that you cannot enter, under any circumstances, if you are under 21. Not even to order food from the filthy deep-fried counter that serves up fried oreos (hell yes), fried twinkies, and a billion different kinds of hot dogs. \nThe oreos are cheap and dipped\/fried fresh, so it's worth it to stand in a line 20-deep with a sticky floor to get to them. But actually hanging out here and gambling? No way.
