To start, this is an Americanized Mexican restaurant, but even for that, it's low. any rating above three stars tells me the rater has really low standards for  food.  ate here on a recommendation but no time to go to a better place. First: chips, good--light &crispy. Waitress, good. Calm, professional, helpful without being intrusive. Salsa--canned, tasted like that stuff made in Noo York City.  albondigas--tasted like Campbell's minestrone soup with meatballs, and too salty.  And they served it with one (big) flour tortilla...really? carne asada was just meh.  beans tased like canned. Drinks? No horchata? Jamaica? really?  There so many places with real Mexican food, there is no reason to patronize this chain of restaurants.  Steer clear.
