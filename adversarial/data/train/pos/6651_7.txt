I Absolutely love this place and all the selections. Only problem in my case majority of the time is the cider selection is slim.  95% of the times we have been here the females as our waitresses have been awesome with service.  As far as the one male my friend and I had during a Sunday lunch hour was so slow and unhelpful and seemed to not care too much about our table.  The Fries are so good with their buffalo wing sauce.  Their Churchill Grilled cheese is absolutely my new favorite as well. My boyfriend loves the 810 with a fried egg and the chicken legs.  I cant wait to try more on the menu.
