Does anyone in Vegas comparison shop? If so, how on earth is this place still in business? \n\nI shop at three stores: Whole foods, Trader Joe's and Smith's. That's it. When I lived in CA, I would shop at Safeway (Vons) for only things I couldn't get at the other two places. With Smith's all over the valley, there is absolutely no reason to shop here. \n\nFor example, a container of Athenos hummus is 2 for $5 at Smith's. At Vons, the same size container of Athenos hummus is $3.99. Burt's Bees lipstick that I get on clearance for $1.48 at Smith's is on clearance here for $3.50. Meat, canned goods, produce, all of it is exorbitantly higher than Smith's. Look at the picture I posted - $19.99 for a jar of ground cardamom?! I could buy a truckload of ground cardamom at any of the ethnic markets in town for $20 and it would probably last me until Jesus comes back. \n\nYeah, I'm familiar with the layout of Vons because it's basically just a Safeway, but if you're not looking to flush your money down the toilet, save a handful of bucks and shop elsewhere.
