The lake view seems to change owners \/ menus more often than I change my tampon during a heavy flow.\n\nI went in there one night due to a severe craving for pancakes. I walked in, did not bother to look at the menu and asked the gentleman at the bar \"Do you have pancakes? I am craving pancakes. I need some. I need some quick\". He replied \"We most certainly do.\" (or something to that effect.) \n\nI sat down. My waiter took my order. I ordered pancakes. He walked away. He came back later and said \"I'm sorry the cook doesn't have the stuff to make pancakes they are not on the late night menu.\" Now, it's obvious that he COULD make me some pancakes. He's a cook, he just doesn't want to make them. It's like when busy brunch places wont poach your bloody eggs.  So I told the waiter to tell him I'd give him 10  bucks.\n\nThe waiter agreed and the pancakes were made.\n\nThe moral of this story is I paid 18 dollars for pancakes because I'm a fucking sucker and have difficulty ignoring food cravings. \n\nThe pancakes weren't even good.
