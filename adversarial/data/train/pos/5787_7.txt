Ok, so before everyone gets all judgmental on me for not giving them a dashing 5 star rating, my custom burrito was actually delicious. I got a seaweed paper burrito with soft shell crab, spicy tuna, green onion, cucumbers, seaweed salad, fresh jalape√±os, crispy wonton pieces and screaming O sauce. Everything tasted fresh and I loved the combination of textures in the burrito. The employees were friendly and smiling. And there wasn't a super long line when we dined in on a Friday night. My gripe is, if I'm going to drop $15 on a meal just for MYSELF, I better be full afterwards. I could have easily eaten another burrito, but I wasn't going to spend another $10 for another one. I went home just to eat again. And the taro chips that everyone is raving about? Yeah, not fond of those or the furikake seasoning that was on them. Glad to say I tried it, but I'll just go to AYCE sushi and be satisfied.
