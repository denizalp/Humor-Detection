If you're going to eat your feelings, you're not going for Chinese... you'll just be depressed an hour later.\n\nI came here on a whim, wanting to carb load before an early Camelback hike.  Being my first time, I was surprised at the crowd waiting for a table.  When the hostess informed me of a 20 minute wait time, I spied a lonely seat at the bar and made a break for it.\n\nI asked the enthusiastic bartender for a hefe and orange, but the unfiltered wheat beer was not on the menu.  He convinced me to go with a Peroni, and it was sheer perfection, and balanced perfectly with my meal.  The $4.50 a bottle seemed steep... I must be conditioned for the dollar PBRs.\n\nStarting out with the fried ravioli appetizer, which consisted of four large puffs of ricotta in a pasta shell, swimming in a delightful marinara.  This dish was smooth and cheesy, each bite eliciting the next.  I should have stopped here, but I hadnt eaten all day, choosing instead to brood in a bed with sweat stained sheets.\n\nFor round #2, I decided on the chicken parm, due to Ashlie's review.  To me, the red sauce on this dish tasted strange, unlike the savory sauce from the appetizer.  Of course, that didnt stop me from eating 72.8% of it.\n\nThe entree also came with two thick slices of toasted french loaf and a chopped anti-pasto salad.\n\nThis place rocked!  And the bar aint a bad place to saddle up to.  It's like the single-riders line at DCA's Radiator Springs Racers
