I've been following Patty's Closet since I moved to Vegas 3 years ago. Such a cute boutique. I've bought dresses, sweaters, leggings, casual tops and the price point have been anywhere from $25-$50. Pretty solid prices for a boutique. I've met the owner, Patty and her husband, Juan, and they're such sweet personable people! Patty's Closet is located next to Aldo Shoes, across the street from a dog boutique and Steve Madden. It's in the same aisle as bebe.\n\nAs of this review, they have 3 locations: this one here in Town Square, Rainbow Blvd and I think NW Decatur. Never been to the Decatur location but my fav has always been Rainbow. The unique thing about Patty's Closet is that each clothing item have 2 smalls, 2 mediums and 2 larges. Once they're sold out, they're sold out. Chances are....they usually don't restock. So if you see something that you like here, buy it immediately. I guarantee you it won't be there the next time you're visiting and it's certainly won't be at the other locations since the 3 stores carry all different items from each other. Such nice unique articles of clothing! I always get compliments whenever I wear something from Patty's Closet.
