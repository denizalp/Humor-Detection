Wow! What a change for the worse!\n\nI really liked this place and as a NY pizza snob gave it a very high review the first time around. This time it was nearly inedibly salty. I mentioned this to the workers who said \"Yeah, it's really salty!\" I just waited for more of an explanation. Had something gone wrong that day? Had someone miscalculated a step in the recipe? Had a container of salt been spilled on my specific slice? \n\nNope. \"It's the sauce\" they said. No apology. No concern. No offer to refund or exchange for an edible slice. As I ate the 4 bites I could handle I watched the other patrons around me. Grimaces and comments not surprisingly obvious... \"Gee, this is salty.\" \n\nNot returning here. Secret Pizza at Cosmopolitain remains the Vegas Strip champ. And it's just across the street.
