Review for the LOUNGE only:\n\nAfter coming out of the Epicentre Theaters, we've always been impressed by the look and feel of the Mez Lounge -- a modern, hip, upscale martini bar.  In fact, we were thinking about bringing out of town guests there next weekend.  \n\nThis past Saturday, we came out of a movie and were astounded.  The upscale martini bar had turned into a strip club.  There was a young woman in a bra and panties up on a stage dancing, gyrating, etc. with a spotlight on her, with everyone cheering her on.  How freakin' ghetto this place has become.   I think we'll take our business (and out of town guests) elsewhere.\n\nTres tacky.
