We came by on a Sunday afternoon. The service was slow and not especially friendly. Patio is fantastic. The turkey Reuben was not very good. Fries came out incorrectly, which they fixed, but they weren't notable otherwise. Food pricing doesn't match flavor or quality. To their credit, they have some great beers on tap, too bad it takes a while to receive them, even when the place is sparsely occupied. \n\nNext time, I'll direct my friends to Humble Pie.
