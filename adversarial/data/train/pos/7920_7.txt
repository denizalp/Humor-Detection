It's Saturday, you want a coffee, you missed the breakfast cutoff at your other favourite place and you're in Bowness. Where do you go? Cadence Coffee.\n\nSporting a menu of all-day breakfast, some light lunch options like sandwiches, salads or wraps, as well as items \"from the grill\" like burgers and reubens, Cadence Coffee is a bit more than your usual coffee shop.\n\nAt 12:30 on a Saturday, it was packed. There was a steady stream of people in queue, and not a table to be had in sight. It seemed that as soon as one freed up, there was someone lurking nearby waiting to claim it. This was enough to convince me to get my sandwich and coffee to go.\n\nI ordered a half sandwich and a 16 oz Americano. My oh my, the half sandwich on it's own was piled high. I wish they'd use a bit of a thicker slice of bread, it was hard to hold all of that up. I'm impressed that the to-go container is biodegradable. How do I know? Well, it's stamped clearly on the top, and unlike the new Sunchips packaging, this biodegradable container is pretty quiet. \n\nService is good and fairly quick for a busy Saturday. They've got a full kitchen ready to make your meal and servers bringing you your food so you don't need to worry about hanging around the counter.\n\nTip: If you can, don't go Saturday at lunch, you may very well find yourself with a 5 star experience :).
