Cute, yes. \nCharming, yes.\nVegan, yes.\n$17.50 for a small roasted veggie sandwich (no side salad or anything), cinnamon bun and coffee (just a plain coffee, nothing fancy), yes. \nWhat!!! My sandwich and cinnamon were ok, but not worth $17.50. The cinnamon bun was a bit different than the non-vegan ones, a bit chewier and not worth the $4.50. The sandwich was ok, and the addition of a bean spread to accompany the roasted veggies is a nice touch but is most definitely was not worth the price.\n\nHoly - I think vegans are being exploited! And I believe this confirms my theory that vegans are so desperate for vegan dedicated places that they all consistently give 4+ stars to vegan restaurants whether these restaurants deserve it or not.\n\nToo $$ for what you get.
