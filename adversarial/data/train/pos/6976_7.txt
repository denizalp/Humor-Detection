Really, Yelp?! You fooled me again with all the five star reviews... 95% of the time you are right and I appreciate it, but 5% of the time you are wrong. This place was the 5%.\n\nI had a bad morning today. I was planning to have late breakfast at Flock & Fowl for their famous chicken rice but they closed down on me because the health inspector was there and they couldn't serve me anything until she leave. Waited 15 min and I left. I did a Yelp research and found out about this place. 6 solid five star reviews. I like Ethiopian food, so I decided to try this place.\n\nThis place is located right next to AT&T store. When I was parking my car, I noticed two heroin addict bums (come on, you know what they look like) hanging in front of the store. Well, as long as the food is good, it doesn't stop me. As soon as I walked in, I thought I was gonna pass out from the over kill smell of incense. It was so strong I got dizzy a little. What is this place a smoke shop???!!! I saw three Ethiopian (Maybe not?) people sitting down. OMG. They were staring at me like they never saw an Asian person in their lives!! How rude!! I should have left at this point but I didn't. I thought I had to order something. How stupid. So I ordered a cup of coffee. The lady didn't understand me, so I pointed the Folgers coffee container, then she finally understood. I noticed they sold some spices I have never seen before.\n\nI literally ran out of the store. I was scared. Got in the car and sipped the coffee. Sour old coffee, of course. I will never recommend this place to anybody. If you are from Ethiopia, maybe you'll enjoy the smell of the store and the spices they sold there.
