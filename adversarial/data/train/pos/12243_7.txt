So for those that wonder about eating 'Afghan food' have zero fear there is no better place to eat that Naan Kabob!\n \nI suppose to be fair I haven't been able to move past the Grilled Chicken because it's that good...in fact it's amazing I can't get enough \n\nEssentially this spot has become my favorite Friday...Saturday and some times Sunday spot. the amount of food you get for $9.99 is borderline highway robbery \n\nYou get freshly baked bread, small salad, and seasoned rice with two chicken kabobs considering that McDonald's is pretty much 10 bucks for a big mac combo you are much better off eating freshly prepared food that will fill you for hours on end - please note I eat enough to feed a small country \n\nI can't speak to other middle eastern places personally but I don't think I am interested in trying simply because the service is excellent the staff are friendly and they are able to satisfy the hungriest of eaters...namely me\n\nviva naan kabob!
