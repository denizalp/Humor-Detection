AAA Army Surplus is a jam-packed store in Kensington Market. This store has piles of military inspired fashion, accessories and more. They have piles of stuff outside in bins and crowded aisles inside the store. The store itself stuffed, tight spaced and makes me feel claustrophobic. This is a browsing type of store where you have to spend time looking through piles of stuff to find something interesting. The guy working there is helpful but seems to be suspicious of everyone walking in. \n\nI usually come here to buy things for my friend's sons. I'm officially the 'cool big sister' who understands their need of military wear for when they battle an army of evil teddy bears at home. I've found some awesome military headwear, army footwear, military outwear, bags (pouches, flasks, canvas bags, backpacks etc.), knives and other weaponry, flashlights, compasses, gas masks (those teddy bears are doing serious damage!), camouflage systems, cords and so much more. You can even find some nice military inspired fashions here that I picked up for my hubby.\n\nThe prices vary. Some things are really cheap, other items are reasonably priced, and you'll find other things that are overpriced- it's all over the place. Personally I wish this place had more space, it's just too crowded and a bit unorganized.\n\nIf you're looking for some interesting military inspired fashion, accessories and more, then AAA Army Surplus is defiantly a place to check out. Also, bring cash!!
