Waited 35 mins for a table even though there were open tables available - service was slow and had to ask for things that are typically preset at the table, like chopsticks, spoons, bowls, plates, napkins. Very unusual especially since it's a restaurant handling raw food... hello, cross contamination? \n\nThe selection at the buffet was basic. The add ons like the beef and spareribs served separately carried a funky smell, maybe it was the marinade or the wood cups they are kept in. The broth was good, got the spicy and tom yum, neither were too spicy. $75 for a 2 person dinner. Cleanliness was questionable and the food was not worth returning for, imo.
