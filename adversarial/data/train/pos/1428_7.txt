Been a member for over 15 years, in December of 2014 went to re-fi my home.\nSubmitted my application, NEVER  heard from them, so went with a larger mtg company, then 7 weeks later, I received a customer survey asking how my loan officer did?  REALLY,I  never heard anything from any Loan Officer!  Sad,, they used to have good customer service
