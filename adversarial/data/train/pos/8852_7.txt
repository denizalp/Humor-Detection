I've totally givin up on THIS starbucks. \nFire everyone. Redo lessons. DO SOMETHING!  I've gotten sick here because they can't listen. \nGirl had no personality at all. I'd say they hired robots. But I'm guessing robots could actually take my order correct.  When I wait 15 minutes for a drink when 3 people's orders come out before mine. .... \nNothing GOOD comes from this store. DONT GO UNLESS YOU WANT SOMEONE ELSE'S DRINK OR PISS IN A CUP
