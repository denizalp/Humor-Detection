Another tourist trap. It's great for kids but everything is just so overpriced and nothing really special. A lot of junk novelty items and the mms don't get varied much!\nThe store is fun but each floor is kinda small and takes 3 floors to see everything. \nBetter of course for big time M&Ms fans but still overpriced
