All I needed to complete my delicious meal here was a good Cuban cigar and some brandy!\n\nWe had the Papa Rellena for an appetizer... very very good. Its a beef filled potato cake with a cilantro lime sauce.\n\nFor entrees my wife and I shared two dishes... the Ropa Viejas (shredded beef brisket in a tomato wine sauce) and the Gallina Frita (crispy fried shredded chicken, onions, in a mojo garlic lime sauce....amazing!\n\nBoth dishes were large...with tons of meat.\n\nGreat service and really good mojitos make for a nice evening out at the Havana Cafe.\n\nFor dessert we indulged on the \"Best Of Phoenix\" (Phoenix New Times) Caramel Flan.... OMG!!!! And the coffee was yummy too! \n\nWe also found a 15% coupon in DineInAz.com.... saved us almost $7!\n\nAs the sign over the door says... \"Cha Cha Cha!\"
