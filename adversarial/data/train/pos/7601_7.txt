Let me start by saying that I am a DIE HARD fan of Louis Vuitton!  Have been ever since I was 18 - you know, just a few years ago ... ;)  I love all the handbags, jewelry, sunglasses, scarves, accessories in this beautiful store (I can't even count the number of handbags I own, a treasured pair of their gorgeous sunglasses and oodles of accessories - yep, I'm an LV whore); however, the staff is way too stiff and stuffy!  \n\nThis is a concept I have NEVER EVER NEVER understood.  They *work* in the boutique .... Key word being \"WORK\" .... I *SHOP* in the boutique ... Key word being \"SHOP\" ...  In other words, YOU the worker bee, should show me, the shopper with the $$$, respect ...  \n\nYou get the point.  Love Louis Vuitton!  Love The Wynn Esplanade!  Not a fan of the LV staff!@
