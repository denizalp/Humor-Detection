Nice little market with a good selection of asian foods. Parking lot is cramped and small so careful here. \n\nWhat I came here for is they have a really nice selection of ready to go meals cooked by different people. Its very much like what you see at Chaiya Monestary food day. Reminds me of being in Thailand and walking through the markets.\n\nI snagged 4 pork skewers and sticky rice for $5. My friend grabbed some other thai foods which she enjoyed. Good pear chili according to her.
