Friendly staff and more fabric than it first seems, there is more in the back.\n\nIf you are crazy for batiks this is your store.  They have rows and rows of them. To me, they are dated and I only use a sprinkle of them. They were very hip and cutting edge decades ago.\n\nThey do have Kona solids in the back, otherwise not too many modern fabrics. \n\nThey also rip their fabrics instead of using a rottery cutter. Only the second store I've encountered in a decade which has hung onto this practice of the 80's. I asked her to cut my other fabrics but it wasn't an issue since I was finishing the bolt.\n\nI found Elmo fabrics here for Z and an Angela Waters free motion book.\n\nWe come to this area once or twice a year.  Wish this was a store I would visit again.\n\nNice people with mainly old fashioned fabrics and cutting practices.
