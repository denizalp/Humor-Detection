I usually go next door to Saigon 8 with my boys, but this time I decided to try something new. I figure it would be healthy and cheap. I ordered the chicken low carb bowl, my boys got the noodle bowl w\/chicken and sweet and sour chicken, my husband got the beef broccoli bowl, and we ordered boba smoothies for the boys. When the food arrived it was very simple and had absolutely no flavor. We had to add soy sauce and sarachi to give it some sort of taste.  I could have simple bought a Asian stir fry vegetable kit from the grocery store and grilled two chicken breast for a lot cheaper.  Very little food, no taste, and over priced. These people that eat here after the gym must be VERY hungry to eat this crap. I give them two thumbs down and a double HELL NO!!!
