The worst service ever.\n\nI was staying in the Charlotte Marriott - where Savannah Red is located - for the Democratic Convention. I worked on events at both Conventions having come from Tampa where the Republicans held theirs. I'd been in the concierge lounge with a couple friends where I'd had 2 drinks. We made our way down to the restaurant and sat at the bar to grab something to eat before we set out on our evening. We were having a fun conversation and laughing and when we ordered,  I was told I was cut off from having more to drink. Not my two friends but just me. It was the most bizarre thing ever. Never, ever had that happen. I was not drunk or unruly and the waitress and the manager refused to listen to reason. I wouldn't go back here if it was the last place on earth to eat.
