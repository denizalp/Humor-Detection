A close friend of mine has been talking about (yet again) a new boba shop popping up around her house so I decided to check this place out. \nI think I was pretty overwhelmed with the menu because I have established the types of drinks I like through the boba shops I usually go to. So it's difficult for me to try a new flavor even though I want something I'm familiar with. There were free drink samples out so I tried the red bean slush which was pretty good. They also have a freezer full of macaron ice cream sandwiches that I most definitely overlooked.\nI finally went with the honey tea latte with black tea and boba. It honestly wasn't my favorite considering how hard it was to stir the sea salt cream around. The cream just stuck to the top and the rest of the drink had this deep honey flavor that kind of got tiring after a few sips. I regretted it and felt that I should have ordered a red bean slush instead.\nOverall, service was pleasant and I'll come by again to try something else before my friend finds out about this review.
