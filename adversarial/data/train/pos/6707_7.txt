I like this store but their female help in the upstairs needs improvement. Tell marnetta to bring more of the cute girls from downstairs up there! Need that to round out the \"upscale\" shopping experience. Also cute girls nicer in general whereas homely people are cranky and self-loathing and high maintenance.\n\n*update*\nSee Rachel's review several months after mine. Wadya know. She also has experienced the fine service of local proleteriat women. Hey rachel, was she homely?
