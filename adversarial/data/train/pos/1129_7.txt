Pretty standard for an average Vegas hotel, except...\n\nCould the staff have been ANY MORE DIFFICULT to work with?\n\nWhy is it so hard to give us the right room the first time?\nWhy is it so hard to give us the right room after you messed up the first time?\nWhy is it so hard to give us an upgrade from the first time, considering you made the mistake?\nWhy do we have to spend a good 10 minutes on the phone with front desk, getting transferred from person to person, only to be forced to ask to speak to a manager, in order for you to make things right?\n\nI've never stayed at Bally's before, but I've stayed in Vegas a million and a half times, and I'd never had such difficulty in figuring out a room reservation.  What's strange is, we'd reserved everything in advance, and it was still difficult.  I've literally WALKED IN without reservations to random hotels in Vegas and had easier times getting a decent room.\n\nStrange, I say.\n\nOh, and the casino is tiny but functional.\n\nIn the end, the room that we ended up with wasn't bad at all, except for the fact that we had a CRT tv.  What hotels in Vegas have CRT tvs nowadays?  Then again, it didn't really matter.  Who goes to Vegas to watch tv?\n\nLast complaint...\n\nMaybe it's the fact that the Harrah's chain hates me after the \"incident\" a few years ago.  Or maybe the chain has just gotten sheisty over the past few years.\n\nWhatever the case, WHY IS HARRAH'S ENT. SO STINGY WITH THEIR COMP POINTS?!
