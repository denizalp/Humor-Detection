I don't even know how to start, came here Saturday night, was pretty calm inside not super busy. Some other patrons were looking upset already at the end of there meal, all of a sudden they start cursing and trying to start a fight. That just kills the mood, food was ok at best, ordered prime rib medium rare, came with a big piece of fat and was if best medium. Friend ordered rib eye, and I swear the meat had a cut like a skirt steak, vegetables were on point though. What a experience...
