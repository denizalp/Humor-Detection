Hatch Art House has carefully chosen art pieces all in one shop. I'm really surprised at the lack of Yelp reviews (huge gap between 2014 to 2017), perhaps greater awareness among Madison Yelpers is needed? It's a great place for local art buying and is attached to Hazel General Store, a great space for makers' products. I think my only recommendation is to merge the two adjoining stores under one name- because each portion just adds to the overall impact of one art and makers' space.
