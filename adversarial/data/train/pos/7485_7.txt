To my utter horror I'm starting to lose my hair. It's still thick on the back and sides but it's thinning at the top front; depending on the day and my mood I look in the mirror and see either a (younger, smarter, less beady-eyed) Rob Ford or a (white, blonde, less murderous) Chairman Mao in the making. Obviously, then, having a good barber who can minimize this effect is essential to my self-esteem. That's where the good folks at Gus the Other Barber come in: anyone who can make me look like I have more hair by taking some of it off is basically my saviour.\n\nI don't think Gus actually works here anymore, but on staff are four or five professional barbers who will chat with you if they sense you're into that, or drop the small talk if it's obvious that you're on the more reticent side like I am. For $21 + tip, and with no direction on my part other than \"short,\" I walk out of there with a great haircut and a neck that's been cleaned up with a straight razor. These guys take their time and won't rush through even a simple haircut like mine, but the most I've ever had to wait was 20 minutes on a Saturday afternoon. As long as I have hair I'll be coming back.
