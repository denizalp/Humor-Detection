Hey Starbucks Fans,\nWanna make sure you waste time in the morning?\nWanna experience bad customer service at .....of all places , a Starbucks?\nIt's almost impossible to get bad customer service at a Starbuck's, right?\nEXCEPT HERE!\nOct. 8th, 2014 approximately 5am  and in a rush to get to work.\nGet my Venti pike through the drive thru.\nHalf way down the road, drink and spit....coffee grounds and tastes like it was burnt.\nDrive all the way back.\nTell them the problem and ask to have it remade.\nAll done without a smile and then,,, and then ...a huddle of about 4-5 barista's form near the drive thru window and I get several hard eyes and especially a long stare from the girl that made my drink.\nThe male barista that remade my drink was unfriendly and unapologetic.\nHe practically threw the drink on the counter and hurriedly walked away \nI then said: \"hey, what about my free drink coupon\"? \"you know, the one that you give out when an order is screwed up\/\"\nThe barista said I should be happy because they just remade my drink.\nI WASN'T HAPPY!\nHe said he would get his manager, AMANDA.\nIf you want someone to put you in a bad mood, just talk to sour puss AMANDA.\nI don't think she is a real manager, but a supervisor of some sorts.\nSupposedly this store was operating with no manager that day because MIGUEL had the day off.\nAMANDA was so sour looking, so unhappy looking and obviously had not been trained properly.\nI said I wanted my FREE DRINK coupon.\nShe said no.\nI said: \"ummmm, well, what are the free drink coupons for then?\"\n\nShe said they are for when a customer is unhappy with heir drink or order.\nI informed her I wasn't happy.\nShe said sorry, but we already remade your drink and now that's all they can do.\n\nTHINK ABOUT IT: you got your drink, it was screwed up....you drove 10 minutes putting me around 35th give or take and then turn around and drive back to 67th....are you going to be happy just to have the drink remade? Ummm isn't that how your drink should have been in the first place?\nNO!\nYou are only going to be made WHOLE if they compensate for your time, for your gas, for being late to work, for the aggravation, right?\n\nSO, IF YOU WANT HORRIBLE, UNFRIENDLY, UNTRAINED STARBUCK BAD CUSTOMER SERVICE....YOU GO TO THE STARBUCKS AT 67TH AND PEORIA IN GLENDALE, AZ.....GUARANTEED TO RUIN YOUR DAY AND LEAVE YOU OUT OF POCKET!
