Lunch Special is always the way to Go?!\n\nA set for 2 people from $16.99 is quite a bargain to try out Sichuan Kungfu Fish. And I am impressed and will be coming back.\n\nLunch Set #2 with Alaska Cod Filet in Peppercorn Spice ($19.99) includes 2 order of rice, Sichuan Kimchi App, 2 can of pops and Cabbage Topping. \n\nWe really enjoyed the broth: not too spicy but with enough kick. Funny thing was that we enjoyed all the additional toppings (Wide Vermicelli + Lotus Roots) more than the fish itself. The cod filet is just as thin and mushy as the basa. I will probably stay with the basa and just order extra toppings!\n\nService is surprisingly friendly. They even moved us to a bigger table without us requesting! \n\nPro Tip: post a photo on WeChat for a free ice cream\n\nI do like the option of hot pot for 1 as I can enjoy my spicy broth even I coming with my non spicy eating friend.\n\nBut for now, I still want my friend to come with me during lunch to share this lunch set for 2!
