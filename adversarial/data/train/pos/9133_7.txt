Avoid the ER! Rude ass nurses. Don't even bother to ask nurse Yvonne questions about your medical condition or else she will seem annoyed and pull the \"I'm the nurse, you're not\" card on you! For instance, I only asked, \"Nurse, do you, by any chance, know why my brother's respiratory rate is a 9?\" She replied with, \"Don't ask me questions like that because your brother just got here.\" Instead of, \"I don't know but I will try to find out for you by further assessing your brother's current condition.\" Also, she repositioned my brother's bed and hit the chair where I was sitting on without informing me or my brother, at least, that she had an intention to reposition the bed. And take note, she would make you seem like you're the rude one in front of other medical staff to make her feel good about herself and you feeling like crap, which you're not. What's worse, other nurses would take her side and would just laugh at you as you try to explain the situation of how Yvonne treated you and your family members. My mom also complained to me that she was only asking Yvonne for an ice pack because my brother was complaining of pain in his arm due to the potassium IV fluid flowing through his veins, and Yvonne gave my mom an attitude by stating, \"You sit down and wait. I'm still charting.\" Shame on Brampton Civic for hiring low-class, low quality, unprofessional nurses to work in the ER. I'm sure that I'm not the only one that experienced this horrible kind of client service here.\n\nTowards the end of Yvonne's shift, my mom told me that Yvonne apologized to my mom but then she added, \"Your daughter needs to respect me because I'm The Nurse.\" What nerve! She was the one that disrespected me. \n\nIn addition, my brother has been admitted to Brampton Civic's ER three times already and the doctors still cannot figure out what's wrong. \n\nDo they even deserve 1 star? I'll still give them 1 because I am generous that way.
