We stopped in on a recent Fri. night.  There was live music on the patio but we opted to sit inside and were immediately seated.  The restaurant was 1\/4 to 1\/3 full but we sat there through at least 4 songs (about 15-20 min.) and no one asked us if we wanted a drink, brought us a glass of water, or acknowledged our presence in any way.  The hostesses were directly behind us, there was wait staff milling around chatting and cleaning other tables, a chef was chatting it up on the patio with other guests but we were completely ignored. I would've liked to try the food but the service was non-existent (other than being immediately seated by the hostess) so that we wound up walking out.
