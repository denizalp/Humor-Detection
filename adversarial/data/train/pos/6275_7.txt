We are flexible and understanding to a busy restaurant.  Upon walking in to an empty podium and waiting for 15 minutes, the hostess who from this point forth will be known as \"the awful employee\" told us that tables were available they just had to be bused.  The awful employee then 20 minutes later said that the tables would not be able to be bused for 30-60 minutes because they are really busy. As this occurs the awful employee's coworkers lean lazily against the coffee bar. Anecdote if I am the hostess I am going to clear the tables myself. The awful employee then recommended sitting at the bar with a finger point.  We ask if we can push tables together to which the awful employee said yes. Shortly there after the awful employee complained our tables blocked the path. The awful employee never provides menus which we found on our own. Moral to the story she sucked and the management of the location was abysmal.  \n\nNow to the positive:\n-food: tasty. Sriracha dip was fantastic. \n-ambience: awesome and very nice\n-bartender: he was fantastic and set up to fail. Probably managing 40 guests as a solo artist\n\nMore negative:\n-3 waitresses attempted to serve plates we did not order \n\nIn the end we can't wait to watch our soccer games and celebrate st patty's day when this place fails and reopens as an Irish pub.
