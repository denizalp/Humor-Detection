Stopped in here to get a frozen banana and play some slots like we always do when in Vegas, this time there was a sketchy group of people in there standing around a table in the food area, one of the guys unzips his pants and yanks out his Johnson dangling it while the entire group thought it was funny and was laughing it up.\n\nI am not a prude but really? In public while we were waiting in line, I and the lady with me didn't need to see some guys junk. \n\nThis grossed me out and we left. Didn't expect to see that.
