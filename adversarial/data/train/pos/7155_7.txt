*Update: I visited again for BBQ, and omg it was even better! We ordered the Combo #2, which was more than enough for 5 people. The meat was fresh, tender, and competitively priced. I suggest ordering the spicy pork - the flavor was incredible without an overwhelming spice and it melts in your mouth the way bbq should. We also ordered duck on the side, which totally surprised all of us!! We all had chinese Duck, but never duck in kbbq. It changed our lives, however, and it should change yours as well - we all recommend it. \n\nRising grill also provides more barbecue essentials than other korean bbq in Cleveland, including ssam and radish wraps. \n\nThe service again was wonderful - quick, attentive, and SO nice. We had a group of five which was larger than the table could accommodate, but we felt very well taken care of. Again, a 10\/10 experience!
