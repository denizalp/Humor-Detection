Time Out Lounge: where hipsters go to die. \n\nYou can always count on seeing all the same people here on a regular basis. This depressing little cash-only dive bar is sometimes our last call spot when we are out and about in Tempe. Entertainment is provided by several pool tables, one dart board, and one sad little jukebox. The bartenders here are strangely high spirited and friendly considering they deal with the same drunk wankers every single night! \n\nThursday nights get a lil rowdy here when Borisimo spins some sweet tunes... probably Time Out's ONLY saving grace! That and the cheap beer...
