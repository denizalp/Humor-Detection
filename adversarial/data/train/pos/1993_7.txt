i had such low expectations since every other wolfgang restaurant i've been to sucked ass.\n\nto be safe, we ordered the chinois chicken salad, which i hear he \"invented\" and a pizza (we got the one with chicken, garlic, and parsley or something like that). \n\nwe also got some beer just in case the food sucked and we had to get our caloric intake from alcohol. luckily, the food wasn't that bad and we were mildly surprised. \n\nthe entire place was empty at around 5pm on a sunday. strange. good service.
