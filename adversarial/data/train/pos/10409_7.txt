I have been to Forequarter dozens of times and damn if it doesn't up its own ante every time. The ever-rotating menu is one of my favorite things about the place- even as a semi-regular, there is always a new inventive cocktail or tasty dish to try. \nPros:\n- I have never had poor service at Forequarter.  \n-Their wine list and craft cocktail menu top any other in Madison. \n-The sausage platter (my go-to) which can include anything from smoked beef sausage to lamb merguez with crispy fingerling potatoes and perfectly salted baby sorrel leaves. \n-The dainty sterling steak knives, the legendary cutting boards, the little silver dishes and trays, yeah, I'm a hipster, you called it. Forgive me. It's adorable. I feel like I'm at my best friend's rehearsal dinner.\n-The trout with roe and sauteed radishes. Are you kidding me with this? so good.\n-Alcoholic slushies served in Weck jars. \n-Ripped bread\/whipped butter. rhythmically delish.\n-They don't always offer great desserts, but when they're on, oh, it's on. Last time I was there, I got housemade mint icecream, showered with housemade butter brickle sprinkles and backyard mint chiffonade, buttressed with some of the best shortbread cookies I've ever had. \n-My tween kiddo declared their smoked beef cheek with green tomato relish and garlic confit \"One of the top ten meals of my life. Maybe better than sushi.\" Show me another restaurant that can convert a tween into a beef cheek aficionado?  Right, didn't think so. \n-Portion sizes. Appropriate for one's appetite and the price.\n\nCons:\n-I feel like I can't go anywhere else. \n-The AC doesn't always keep up. \n-Always a wait. \n\nI can't think of any other cons.  Just go here, drink the best Dark and Stormy in town while you wait for your table, and then sit down, check out how good your date looks in their flawless [candle]lighting, and prepare to gorge yourself until you get high on food.
