Heh. Only time I've ever been to a strip club, which I feel like is kind of a self-serving disclaimer. Anyway, I kinda had fun here. Bouncer's a real winner, but what do you expect? Apparently $10 per song is pretty cheap for a dance? Look, just drink your required beer (a little marked up, not terrible) very slowly and stick near the front of the stage. If you're like me and you like looking at naked women, you'll have a good time. Extra points for good diversity. Also fun for people watching--in the audience, that is.
