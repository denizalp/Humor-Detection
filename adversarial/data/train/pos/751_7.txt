For the price...I can't complain at all.  The place is pretty clean, they do a good job of making sure they hit your room when you leave...and them blackout shades?  Why...I'm going to get myself a pair of them for home!\n\nI'm not really a \"gambler\"...I've never been to a casino before, and I hate losing money, so one would ask why I was in Vegas (visiting a friend)...in any event, I DID gamble, and I wound up winning the amount of money my entire trip cost me, so thats a bonus if you ask me.  Who doesn't like a free vacation?  \n\nThe gym here is a joke, though - I've never been to a hotel\/resort\/whatever the hell you want to call this place where they charge people staying here for the gym.  Plus, $15 dollars for a gym filled with antiquated machines? C'mon now.  They did have it fully stocked with water and towels...but cmon.  \n\nThe food court had a decent selection of stuff, and they have a giant movie theater.  Who goes to a movie in Vegas?  Well, the locals, I assume, and anyone that spent 16 hours in the casino drinking and playing roulette. Not me, of course, just sayin.\n\nALSO their buffet is friggin worth it.  Sign up for their \"casino card\" or whatever it is - you dont pay for it - and you get a discount, and the breakfast buffet is worth getting up for.  What else...umm, the dealers were nice, I guess?   Oh - the people working the front desk are a little stupid, when we checked in, we asked for a rollaway cot and they forgot to bring it until we called, and we asked for a late check out and they said \"well........we think we're sold out\".  Pull yourself together fools, you're not sold out, we'll take that extra hour.  Besides, the toilet overflowed with soap suds last night...not due to us.  Fools.
