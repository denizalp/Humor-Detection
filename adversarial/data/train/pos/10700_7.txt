Mr. Terrible, you are a fine man. \n\nTerrble's is fondly known as a \"local's casino\", which means it cheap, and full of weathered ass old people who have tanned and smoked for way too long. \n\nThe hotel is located off the strip, but within walking distance to Hard Rock Hotel, and CVS, the home of value-priced Tecate. \n\nThe rooms were pretty large and comfortable. There was plenty of space for us 4 hags and all our bonus accessories and snacks. Our room was very close to the pool. The pool = kickass. Terrible's keeps some rambunctious birds hanging out there. The pool has a lot of plantlife surrounding it, which makes you feel like you are in palm springs, and not at that one \"local's casino\". \n\nOn friday night I ate a delicious steak, hash browns, eggs, and sourdough toast for 6 dollars.\n\nOn saturday, while my friend was betting her life savings on \"00\", the wacky roulette dealer was making the rest of us poor bitches laugh. I wanted to get her name, and write a nice letter, but failed to do so. That was probably just the beer talking. \n\nAll in all, a wonderful time. I couldn't hate the place, even when I saw the sunrise on Sunday morning, and realized 1) I was still drunk, and 2) we had to check out in 4 hours.
