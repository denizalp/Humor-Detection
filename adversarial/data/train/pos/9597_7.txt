I don't know. This place seems a little tragic to me; the self-consciously arty vibe inside and the affected hipsters behind the counter are aggressively mannered, but also a little frayed around the edges. It's like a very good diorama of a coffee shop made by someone who has seen one in a movie or read about one in a book.  The coffee is just ok.
