FINALLY, SOMETHING NEW AND COOL ADDED TO THE WEST VALLEY!\nYes, it's a movie theater but I truly enjoyed my experience here. I would say that this Harkins theater is different from other theaters because it has more of a luxurious touch to it. The theater itself is massive, with many movie rooms including Cine 1, which is rumored to be the largest screen in Arizona. Also, with no senior it student discount, a regular ticket lands at $11.00.\nThe food was really good, expensive, really but good. We got French fries and the Oreo churros which was $4.50 an order. It was almost not worth it because of the price and the portion size but all in all, it was quite tasty. Besides, it's expected that any movie theater or any other entertainment center's food is set to be pricey right? \nMy first movie here was Girl on the Train, which was a GREAT movie, but my experience was so much more enhanced here. These cushioned seats reclined with a very nice leg rest! They were leather and massive, and the arm rest is definitely shareable that'll prevent those awkward hair tickles from sharing an arm rest with some stranger. \nI'd say because this theater is close to home, my recent visit was a positive experience, and my love for movies will make me a definite regular. WOOT!
