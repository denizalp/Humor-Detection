I'm not really a hot dog person either, but I make an exception a when it comes to Happy Dog.  Best hotdogs in Cleveland!\n\nYou can pick from a regular all-beef dog or a veggie dog, with your choice of about 1,000 toppings.  Well not really, but the variety of toppings is unreal and leaves for an endless number of combinations! Chorizo Chili, a few kinds of coleslaw, a plethora of cheeses, fried egg, Alien relish, chunky peanut butter, Spaghetti-Os, Fruit Loops, a whole bunch of sauces...it's insane!  \nTwo dogs is enough to fill most people up, but if you add in a basket of tots, you're done for.  Any of the hotdog sauces are available for tot dipping sauces as well. I wish the tots were homemade, but they look like the frozen Ore-ida variety...still tasty though, especially when drunk.\n\nThe inside is very casual, hipsteresque with the bar in the middle and tables and booths surrounding it. There's a stage right by the entrance for live music and it gets pretty loud on the weekends.  \n\nOverall a great, layed back place to come for an epic cheat meal or a few beers.\n\nSteve L is lucky to live right by Happy Dog.
