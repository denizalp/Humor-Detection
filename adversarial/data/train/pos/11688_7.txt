PUBES! Do not eat here. I'm writing this review before my call to main office. I work by this restaurant and frequently visit, satisfied... With a side of PUBES. \n\nIt was clear to both me my coworkers and the waitress that the hair in my food was a PUBE. I asked her to come over to my table, and asked her what it looked like to her, a sure face of shame and guilt fell over her stare. She would not answer me. \n\nThis is atrocious...I intend to let the head office know. Hoping to stop her from working there at least but she runs the restaurant full time. Discusting.
