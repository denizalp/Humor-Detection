I've been to the location on Durango a couple times .. You can tell it's def not the same cooks, overall \"OK\"..\n\nThe food lacked a little flavor in the food.. Some salt maybe? \n\nFood items chosen :\n* Nutella Crepes - simple, thick, Nutella crepes topped with whipped cream and almonds \n* Country Fried Steak (comes with your choice of eggs, side potato and pancake) - crispy outside, moist inside, nothing special \n* Plain Pancakes - served with butter and syrup\n* Side of Portugese Sausage - had to get a side of it, who doesn't like Portugese Sausage ¯\\_(ツ)_\/¯\n* Chili Moco (comes with eggs and side of potatoes) - Loco Moco smothered in chili, at first sounded good but when actually eating it.. It was pretty bland.. I was expecting a more authentic Hawaiian chili and the ground beef patty needed flavor.. Eggs weren't that great but the seasoned potatoes were good..\n\nExpected more out of the items because I enjoyed the previous visits at the other location.. They just need to add a touch of love to the food. \n\nService was kind of slow but staff were still friendly ..\n\nMaybe the food will get better as time passes.. But will most likely come back considering it's close to home..
