PROS: \n+ Northsiders have long been awaiting their own LVAC, and this location is super clean with all new equipment. \n+ Layout is similar to other locations, so it's easy to find what you need.\n+ Indoor squash\/racquetball\/whatever-you-play-with-a-racket space! \n+ The women's locker room has the bathroom stalls in the back on the way to the showers, completely separate from the changing area and lockers.\n+ The water fountains have motion-activated bottle filling stations! Please bring this to ALL LVAC locations!\n \nCONS:\n- Women's gym seems to be an afterthought. Cardio equipment has built in screens, but none of them work. This is a simple fix. In the mean time, the wall-mount screens don't even have captions on. Also, there is very poor air circulation in this area. Why have this area if you're going to make it completely unappealing?\n- Parking lot was full and the gym seemed decently busy, but their class schedule is pretty dismal with limited offerings and time slots.\n- I have mixed feelings about having a Yogurtland inside of a gym. Like I need any temptation to eat back the calories I burned. Froyo is only minimally healthier than ice cream, and that's only if you eat it plain. I'm not sure this is aligned with the interests of LVAC's core members.
