I don't post reviews a lot. This is probably only my 3rd and I only really like to post when service is extraordinary. I found Cortez at First Friday's about 6 months back and really found my love for coffee. I sampled it and really grew to enjoy black coffee. This morning I was craving that so I figured I'd head over for a cold brew. I know quite a bit about coffee, having a lot of barista experience, but of course I don't know everything. This guy, with blondish hair, gauges, piercings, I don't know how else to describe him, was working. The brew today was Nitro. I asked him what kind of roast was it. Like light, medium, or dark. He says, \"Well it's infused with nitrogen.\" I thought, \"Okay...so what does that mean?\" He says, belittling me, \"You don't know what that means? It's like a stout, alright?!\" \n\nSo moving on from that, I really just wanted to leave but I was curious about any classes they may teach. Like roasting, cold brewing, etc. He was like, \"Well, what do you wanna learn...\" It was brutally clear how annoyed he was with me. I was the only other person in there. And since of course I'm no expert on coffee, I said, \"Anything I guess.\" Constantly after everything I said his attitude was condescending. I know it's hard to tell just given the dialogue. You'll just have to take my word for it. It was like I was such a burden when this company is one I can potentially invest more money in. Well damn, after this experience, despite the coffee being great, I think I'll continue to give my money to Dutch Bros. They know how to treat their customers with respect and praise.
