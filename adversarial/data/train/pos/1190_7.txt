Been looking for a good sandwich shop but found a GREAT one instead!!! Dave and Jodi take pride in everything made here,  which is ALL from scratch. The French Onion soup is amazing,  as was my Ethan Allen sandwich.  Hubby had the special of the day which was the Cubano.... Talk about a great sandwich....Yum yum!!! We loved all we had so much,  we ended up ordering ToGo for dinner later....hurry up 6pm!!!
