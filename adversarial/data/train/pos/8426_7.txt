Who knew I could enjoy something else in Vegas besides eating, booze, gambling, women and shows. This place definitely is the place to get a massage but the better part of this was the spa facility you get to use. \nLocated in Caesar's Palace. You get to use the spa if you get a massage treatment or for $45 you use the facility.\nThey have Wet Saunas, Dry Saunas, Steam Room for shaving, Cold room, Roman baths, large jacuzzi and a lounge area to watch TV. I'm sure you could stay here as long as you want and enjoy their drinks and snacks. \nThey also have a slew of  toiletries such as shaving cream, razors, gel, combs, hair dryer and pretty much anything you need.\n\nTip 1: Don't have to worry about bringing anything besides your swimming trunks. \nTip 2: You get to use the gym as well with your package so come earlier if your hotel doesn't have one or you are lucky enough to opt out of the resort fee.
