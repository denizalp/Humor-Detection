After a round of drinks, someone in our group recommended Karaoke and everyone was game. J Karaoke is one of the highest rated spots in LV, so I called ahead to see if they could accommodate, last minute, a group of 10 people. They said, yes, and we headed that way.\n\nLocated in Chinatown, in a strip mall, I was the second to arrive. They have a bar up front and one member of our group had a drink already when I arrived. As we started spilling in, they showed me a couple of rooms and we grabbed the larger one. Good thing, because our group grew to 12 people. \n\nPrivate rooms, with 2 large tvs, 2 mics, disco ball and tambourine (this was the BEST prop for Karaoke). Song selection is offered in 3 languages. Staff kept the drinks flowing (full bar) and had snacks (edamame, fries, wings, etc).\n\nA few members of the group acted like they weren't going to sing, but once inside the room and a couple of drinks, EVERYONE was singing and dancing. Our group lost track of time, because we were having so much fun. \n\nHighly recommend and would definitely return!
