This place was suggested by a former colleague when we were trying to figure out a place for a catch up lunch meeting. Funny, I've lived in Richmond Hill almost my entire life and apparently this place has been here almost the same length of time. What? \n\nThis is #YelpLife as it were I suppose. Finding hidden gems right in your backyard. And in case you're wondering where you can find this spot, it's located in the plaza on the North-East corner of Bathurst and Carville Road (aka Rutherford).\n\nIt's simplistic enough from the outside but the modern open concept design that lays within is a refreshing look for an Italian restaurant. \n\nGiven that we were here for lunch, I didn't have anything to drink, but after hearing about some of their specials I couldn't resist the sound of the Risotto Giambieri (shrimp). It was a hearty portion for sure and the rice was cooked as it should be (and if you've ever watched Hells Kitchen, Gordon Ramsey would have you believe that this is a bloody big deal!)\n\nMy only complaint is the dish was a little light on the main attraction (the Shrimp), I counted 3 in my dish. Which I suppose is fair for a lunch but for the price I had hoped for a couple more. On the plus side the shrimp I did receive were a fair size.\n\nI'd definitely return to give them another try, and sample some of my other fave Italian dishes.\n\n\nEatcrest Out!
