Went here last night and noticed something was different. After reading others, now i know why. Corporate sell-out.\n\nNo matter. We still had a great time working our way through the Happy Hour menu. Asian wings were great and all drums. Whoohoo! Split a Widow burger (good but not great) and also had fried zucchini and chips and salsa. Salsa was very salty and garlic-y but very fresh. \n\nOverall, service was friendly and attentive even though there did seem to be a longer than normal wait for drinks to re-appear. Food was good and prices were average. Best part was, though, it was the deadest I've ever seen it. Thanks Corporate!
