YELP 365 CHALLENGE 2014-(361\/365) \"A Woman's Kind Of Candy Store\"\n\nStopped into Sephora while we were checking out the area. Wifey and sister in law needed to restock their make up goods, and wanted to scope out any holiday deals so I thought I'd check out the Men's section (if they had one?) and sure enough, they did. Brie was nice enough to direct me to a little wall WAAAY in the back where I sniffed some samples, but nothing really caught my eye, er...nose.\n\nShe was also very courteous, knowledgeable and helpful with the ladies, and even offered some of her own trade tips and secrets which made the visit for each and every one of us very pleasant. After a while, I needed to take a breather outside from all that sensory overload of scents! The ladies got what they needed and we were on our way.\n\nThis store pretty much caters to the ladies,but it gets 4 stars from me from the service and convenience for the Mrs. and I'm pretty sure it is a welcome addition to women who live in the area without having to take a far drive to another location.  ALOHA!!!\n\nShaka Meter:  \\uuu\/  \\uuu\/  \\uuu\/  \\uuu\/  4
