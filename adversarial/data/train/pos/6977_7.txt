This is a rarity for me I am writing a review on a place I've never stepped foot into. \n\nWhile I have never actually entered the Retro Bakery (it's on the wrong side of town,but hopefully i'll stop in soon), I have had the pleasure of eating more than a few of their cupcakes.\n\nI am a Buttercream FREAK, and anywhere who's motto is It's All About the Buttercream, is alright in my books. \n\nMy hands down favorite offering is Milk and Cookies, I mean come on it's a delicious chocolate chip cupcake, with a generous dose of vanilla buttercream and just when you think it can't get any better...oh yeah, they top it with a chocolate chip cookie, and we're not talking about a premade chips ahoy, we're talking custom baked cookie goodness...AMAZING!!!\n\nI have also had the pleasure of sampling the Sprinkled Doughnut, Chocolate Loves Vanilla, and Vanilla Loves Chocolate, they were all delicious, but the Milk and Cookies is still my first love.\n\nI look forward to eating my way through their menu, and you trying one of their cakes in the immediate future.
