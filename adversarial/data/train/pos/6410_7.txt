I had to try RigaTony's after I saw that my Yelp friend, Joyce W, received the ROTD here.   I have mixed feeling after my visit.  They have the potential to be a great restaurant.  We arrived at about 7 PM to a packed restaurant.  Fortunately, I had made reservations and were seated immediately.  \n\nWe ordered the a smoked salmon pasta, the four cheese penne and a spaghetti with meat sauce.  To our surprise, after ordering, they brought out an antipasto salad and some bread.  The antipasto salad was delicious.  It had plenty of meat and cheese.  The bread was okay.  It was like any other bread that we have had.  If we had known about the salad and bread, we probably would've only ordered 2 pastas and shared.  \n\nTheir pastas dishes were enormous.  I loved their portion sizes.  If we weren't traveling, I would've taken the leftover pasta home.  The meatball and sausage spaghetti and the four cheese penne were winners.  Their sauce was full of meat and not acidic (sour).  Just the way we like it.  The sausage in my the spaghetti was chopped up.  I prefer my sausage uncut in one piece.  The four cheese penne was so go that my daughter devoured it without sharing.  My wife was disappointed in the smoked salmon pasta.  We thought that the smoked salmon pasta had a good taste, but, we all thought that the smoked salmon pasta was in the microwave oven a few minutes too long as the pasta around the edges seemed really dry.  \n\nOverall, I liked this place.  It seemed like a great deal with the antipasto salad and bread.  Their portion sized was generous.  Stick with their popular items like their meat or Alfredo sauce, and everything should be great.  3 1\/2 stars.
