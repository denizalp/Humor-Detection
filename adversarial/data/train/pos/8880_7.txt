It had been a while since we were last at Bouchon so thought it was high time we paid another visit.\n\nWait time at 9am was around a quoted 15 min that was really only like 5 min - yay!\n\nI chose the Bread Pudding French Toast - have to say wasn't a fan.  There was an apple compote aspect to it which I thought had too much liquor.  Threw off the flavor for me but luckily, the Mr agreed to swap dishes w\/ me.  Yup, he's a keeper!\n\nAnd this was after I talked him into choosing the Sourdough Waffle w\/ Vanilla Butter.  It was just as scrumptious as I remembered!  Nice crispy on the outside \/ soft on the inside waffle paired w\/ this wonderfully vanilla-infused butter.  It was heaven!\n\nHe liked the frenchie - me, not so much but we both agreed the waffle was the winner by far\n\nWashed it all down w\/ Bellinis - Champagne & Peach puree - what's not to love?!\n\nIt was a lovely breakfast & fab welcome to our Vegas getaway\n\nSo recommendation for Bouchon is to stick w\/ the waffles & everyone'll be happy!
