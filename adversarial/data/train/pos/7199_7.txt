Well, damn. This place is just too good to be stuck in a dimly lit food court with a dimly lit sign in the middle of almost nowhere.\n\nOf course, I've had it bookmarked for a pretty long time after seeing the outstanding reviews, but it took stumbling upon it by accident while getting lost in the PATH to actually try it out. Definitely one of the best hidden gems I've ever been to! The noodles are absolutely delicious, and the broth was so savoury I literally gulped it down. The shrimp wontons? Huge! I was really surprised to see the enormous pieces of shrimp packed in them. The vegetables were super fresh too - no wilted leaves here! And nothing tasted like the artificial or over-seasoned MSG filled stuff you might expect at a food court (or elsewhere). Can this place open up other locations already??? I think it can give even some of the popular restaurants uptown a run for their money. :P\n\nCan I also just say again, bless you Yelp, you're doing great work :D
