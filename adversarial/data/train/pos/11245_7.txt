A relatively new community park with a lot to offer. A new fishing dock was donated with generous gifts from the Estate of William M. Cadwallade and the Hillman Foundation. \n\nThere's a new free Summer concert series called Rock the River. \n\nPart of the fun is a nice kayak rental facility.hosted.by Kayak Pittsburgh. \n\nA new event space is available for rental, it's a rather large pavilion. \n\nBathrooms are quite modern, a step up from what I see at most parks. \n\nThen there's some comfortable Adirondack with a gorgeous view of the Allegheny.  Certainly something for those who would like to relax or also enjoy a more active life.
