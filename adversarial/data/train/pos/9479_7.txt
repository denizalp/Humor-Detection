including the nearby Steakhouse concept from Morton's - explained with great excitement, those who have not been to the casino on Paradise recently may want to stop by soon in order to witness a more open floorplan that the Chef expects to evolve further in the coming weeks and months, the former Fuel Coffee Bar now a neon-lit Dunkin Donuts soon to be joined by a Mediterranean restaurant where 35 Steaks + Martini's resides while Pink Taco is also soon due for a menu reboot and exterior facelift.  \n\nProudly discussing the resources available at such a large property for sourcing, the vast majority of Oyster Bar's Seafood flown in daily, it was after a bit more chat that Manchester sprung to work with what was essentially carte blanche, the complimentary fresh-fried Salt and Vinegar Chips thin and nicely seasoned while Calamari \"Fries\" featured the Cephalopod sliced into strips and gently battered beneath thickened Soy and ground Peanuts, the light application of Sriracha adding a bit of heat that made the whole dish seem like something inspired by Thai cooking.\n\nOffering six Belon Oysters on ice next, the meaty Bivalves described as \"The Rolls-Royce of Oysters\" living up to their billing with a coppery edge that dissipates with a bit of sweetness, Oyster Bar's Lobster Roll passes up on all the Mayonnaise nonsense to put nearly a pound of Butter-poached Crustacean on a housemade Roll with handcut Fries plus a variety of Vinegars and Hot Sauces, the $22 choice a better value than many found during peak season in the Northeast and easily the best tasted to date in Las Vegas.\n\nAt this point a local legend thanks to tourists up-all-night at Palace Station, it only seemed appropriate to next give the Hard Rock's Pan Roast a taste, Manchester and his team holding nothing back with an \"All In\" version featuring filleted Loup de Mer, a full Lobster, several White Shrimp plus Blue Crab in a piquant orange broth that, like the Shrimp and Cheesy Andouille Grits to follow, was not only flavorful and cooked perfectly, but more than enough to share.\n\nRequesting a cup of the Poblano Corn Chowder based on personal taste, the use of lightly charred Kernels amidst the creamy base fortified by Potatoes and brightened by Garlic Oil, those looking for something a little more fancy would do well to request an order of Manchester's classic Linguini with Clams, the fresh noodles made on-site in the pastry shop cooked with a nice tooth amidst so much sliced Garlic and White wine that Vampires and significant others may be warded off, but well worth it thanks to both the just-cooked Clams on top and the copious amount of Bellies and Adductor Muscles found in the Sauce.  \n\n****1\/2 Located near the doors and proper ventilation, the gaming floor's smoke imperceptible from any of the high-backed, comfortable seats, Oyster Bar at Hard Rock Hotel & Casino sees one of Sin City's most well-liked Chef back in the spotlight with a smile on his face and big plans for the future while cooking up classics plus a few inspired additions at a price that is not only affordable, but essentially a bargain considering the portions and ingredient quality.
