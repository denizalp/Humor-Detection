I had breakfast with Shelly's on my visit to Pittsburgh this time around. Am sure Pamela will be upset when she reads this, but you gotta do what makes you happy. This is a new business at a location that previously housed a dinner for decades. The interiors are unassuming and call out Steelers only, but the owner and servers are really very friendly. There are tables for large groups and comfy bar stools. I ordered spinach feta tomato omelette, they delivered exactly what it says, nothin more nothin less. The portion sizes are right and the food is not as greasy as the other more popular spots. The home fries are probably how I would make them at my home. Do bring cash as they do not accept cards here.\nTouchdown for me...definitely would come singing for the potato and omelette ...brown and yellow, brown and yellow, brown and yellow
