So far so good. The dining area is really nice. The menu is pretty extensive and they have different duck dishes that sets this place apart from other Thai places in the area. \n\nSince I was at the coffee shop for a couple hours and it was already lunch time when we left there, decided to stop by and check out this place for their lunch specials.\n\nLunch plates are offered between 11-4pm and the prices are under $10 for the 18 different entrees listed. Comes with a clear broth soup with a dash of black pepper seasoning. Also choice of steam or brown rice. Nice that they don't up charge you for brown rice!  They had great entree choices but I chose my standby dish; Yellow Curry Tofu to see how it measures up to the other Thai places. Unfortunately it was just okay for me. I was a little bummed out. Oh well.  The seasonings were not present and the curry was weak IMO .  The rice though that accompanied my order was cooked perfectly and I ate that all.  And I normally don't finish my rice!  I am impressed that the lunch portions offered are a pretty good size for lunch meals.  More food than lunch plates offered in other places.\n\nThe menu is an interesting read. Thirsty Drink,(for drinks) Sweet Lover(aka desserts), Hot & Warm,( Spicy and Mild I think they meant)  but what's Health & Healthy? I do appreciate the menu is organized into sections which made it easy to read and quick enough to zero in to what you are hungry for.\n\nEven though my order was messed up initially, service here is great! The staff is really nice and my orders came out pretty quickly. I DO look forward to coming back here again. When I have a bigger appetite I want to try out  one one of the duck dishes and some of the Chef Recommendations for dinner.
