Ohhhh myyyyy loooorrrddd. This is the best burger I have ever had. Seriously. A burger is a burger - it can usually taste good regardless. But this is heavenly (see what I did there???). \n\nFirst of all, don't go here hoping to grab a cozy seat and chat with friends inside. Take it and GO. It gets super duper busy, the lineup during the weekends\/dinner\/lunch time is all the way around and past the next door convenience store. I had THE PRIEST. It's a cheeseburger PLUS the option.\n\nThe option is this magnificent something...portobello mushrooms, with oozing cheese, breaded and deep fried. I felt an artery clog just from writing that and I would do it all over again. And then of course there's the meat - I'm pretty sure they just use some kind of secret, ground up beef sprinkled with angel dust...\n\nThe bun is kind of small so it's messy in the best kind of way. There were around 5 people working behind this tiny counter and they were fast and friendly.\n\nThere is a secret menu. Google it because I don't know how secret it is and I am NOT ready to get kick off of yelp OR kicked out of B.P. for revealing it. It shouldn't be hard to find, I think it's on their Facebook page. Yeah, I'm a fan.\n\nI didn't get the fries because fries are fries, it ain't no gooey portobello mushroom concoction. \n\nGO HERE! GO GO GO GO! In my option THIS IS THE BEST BURGER JOINT IN TORONTO. And then go to the beaches, cuz I love it there :)\n\nxoxo
