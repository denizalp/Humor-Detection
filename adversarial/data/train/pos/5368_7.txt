Went to my car, hopped in, drove 3 blocks and knew something was WRONG.\noh NO! a FLAT tire. \nMade it back to my house and called Budd's.\nThe owner says if I can get the car there he can fix it right away.....\n\nLuckily for me, Budds is 4 blocks- the other way- from my house and my hubby was able to come home and pump the tire up for the trip downhill.\n\nAs promised, 2 hours later the tire was fixed and the Nasty looking screw that was the evil culprit was taped to the invoice.\nTHANKS for same day, no appt needed, no BS, local service!
