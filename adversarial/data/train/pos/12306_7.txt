This wagyu might be the best I've ever had but the whole menu, including for example the truffle soup, is aggressively overpriced -- well above Per Se \/ French Laundry.\n\nAs for the extremely French service, it doesn't bother me much, but some found that it stifling. The visionaries like Alice Waters have long known that the way to cultivate an adoring clientele is to respect them and put them at ease, rather than make them feel uncomfortable.
