Reminiscent of our recent NOLA trip I couldn't stand going one more day without some Creole food. \n\nWe ordered the 1\/2 jambalaya,  1\/2 Creole shrimp, full order of the Friday cod special, and two pralines. All for total of $30.\n\nThe jambalaya was very heavily tomato based, with pieces of tender cubes chicken,  ham,  chunks of celery and tomato. I favour the jambalaya from Vertie Marte in NOLA.\n\nThe Creole shrimp had generous portion of shrimp with a savory Cajun tomato sauce. \n\nThe cod was a single piece of cod drizzled with a buttery sauce and pecans. My partner remarked it was definitely a single serving,  not a big portion but enough for a individual who isn't starving. \n\nThe cornbread and pralines were the stars here. The cornbread came with each entree, were sweet,  crumbly, with a crusty outer layer. The pralines were a hit, just as good as the Southern Candymakers.\n\nWe'd definitely like to return to try the po boys or other mouthwatering offerings.
