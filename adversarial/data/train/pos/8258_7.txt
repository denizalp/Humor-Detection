Seeing this place on the \"Top 10 Best Italian\" restaurants in Toronto, I had nothing but high expectations. \n\nCool and vibrant place for a casual dinner with friends. Using words as \"ciao\", \"buongiorno\", and \"minchia bro\", will make you sound well traveled.\n\nNevertheless, if I had to bring Don Corleone to dinner, and my life depended on it, I would reconsider my options.
