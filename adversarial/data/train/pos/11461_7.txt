Yea I'll admit I was thrown off by the location of this place too, but I'd be lying if I didn't say it was the best sushi I ever ate. I should know my girlfriend's a mermaid. \n\nKinda no point if you don't go for the all you can eat, I honestly want to be in better shape just for the sole purpose of eating as much as I can here. The staff is very friendly and the sushi chefs themselves are animated and funny. It definetly puts everyone in a better mood. \n I promise you, you will love this place, the only reason you might not, is if you hate sushi and\/or racist. ............But if you are then why are you going there?................  \nJust try it.
