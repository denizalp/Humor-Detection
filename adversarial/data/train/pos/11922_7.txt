What can I say... Moving in slow motion today after concerts two nights in a row. Was not in the mood to cook let alone actually setting foot outside of the house. Found Siri Thai thanks to my fellow helpers. I was obviously famished because I way over ordered. Tom Kha was pretty solid as was the papaya salad and beef pad see ew. The duck panang, however, didn't have that beautiful creamy and luxurious sauce that I love. Also, the crispy pork basil was pretty fatty and not rendered down. I was really looking forward to the crab fried rice but it was really salty and an overly fishy taste. A nice touch was that they threw in a box of vanilla wafers. I thought initially that it was instead of fortune cookies but when I opened the bag I saw those had been included. Reasonable price and pretty huge portions. I will be enjoying leftovers all week. I will for sure order for delivery again at some point.
