First time having vegan and raw vegan dessert. I got the special Samoan cookies and the vegan pomegranate cake. They also threw in the vegan peanut butter cup :) \n\nThe vegan peanut butter cup is good nothing crazy, but a good starter. \n\nThe Samoan cookie reminded me exactly like the girl scout Samoan cookies. Except the consistency is wet and moist like. It's also a lot larger!\n\nAs for the vegan pomegranate cake, I was not impressed. It just tasted plain but the frosting was delicious.\n\nOverall, they have some pretty good desserts. I need to come back and try their food!\n\nThe staff is very nice!!
