Came here with my daughter and we really enjoyed the atmosphere upon entering.  Our server was better than fantastic!  We had a hard time making a decision on what we wanted to order and our server was patient and helpful with recommendations.  \n\nWe ordered half Margherita pizza and half Veggie pizza.  Both were amazingly delish!  We couldn't decide which one we preferred since they both were great.  In addition, we ordered the small Mediterranean salad to share and it was incredible.  Super fresh ingredients used for both the pizza and salad.\n\nMy daughter was so impressed with the food and service that she plans to bring a few of her friends there to celebrate a birthday since it isn't too far of a drive from ASU.  \n\nHighly recommend giving it a try!
