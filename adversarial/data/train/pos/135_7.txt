Was planning on eating an ice-cream cone but then I saw The Little Dog. \n\nA Montreal steamie is 1.99$ with a lot of toppings- a small cone is like 3.50$. F that noise. \n\nIt was as good as a little steamed hotdog should be. The dude was really bad at selling hotdogs \/ poutine. He seemed sort of sad about the whole hotdog slingin' industry. Next time, I'll try the bigger ones. Chicago and NYC dogs are also on the menu. Not sure what their deals are.
