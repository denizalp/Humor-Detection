My husband has a serious infatuation with custard ice cream. He is also is a fan of Culver's and luckily, we found one not too far away from where my Mom is currently living on the East Side of town.\n\nWe came here after seeing a movie and he ordered a small strawberry sundae. We had no idea they were running a special $2.00 for this and he ordered, we left and whilst he was devouring his treat in the backseat, we heard not a peep out of him. He declared it was his favorite and he should have gotten 10 scoops!\n\nI was happy he was happy and like the other Culver's, the food isn't of interest to me (he likes the fried cheese curds too), I was glad he got his ice cream fix.
