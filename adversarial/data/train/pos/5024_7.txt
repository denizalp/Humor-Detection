We stopped here before a road trip at about 6 in the morning to fuel up our body and minds and we were pretty glad we did when it was said and done.\n\nIf you've been to one Eat N Park then you have a pretty good idea of what you're in for at another.  This location was clean, friendly and probably cause the time of day, not busy.  We ordered cheese sticks, the pot roast sandwich and a super burger (I know at 5A.M. But don't judge us lol).  All of the food came out hot and fresh and was really great in the flavor department.  \n\nYou would think my excitement would rate it 5 stars but hot fresh food and service with a smile should be the norm at any establishment but it doesn't negate the fact that it wasn't an awful experience either.  If you need some food and you're out that way, this is a solid stop.
