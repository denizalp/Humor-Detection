Don't expect to get great customer service here. Employees walk around, stare at you, and they don't say a thing. This place is huge and they sell a variety of items. (Hispanic and American products as well)\n\nPrices though seem to be much higher then the other Asian markets that are around the area. I stood 5 minutes at the dairy counter even though there was an employee right in front of me and two which seemed to be managers, standing next to me talking. \n\nI got a stare and that was my que to tell him what I wanted. No \"how can I help you?\" Nada. I didn't even get a thank you. The cashier was no different. Rude.\n\nNever coming back. This was my first and last time, byeeee.
