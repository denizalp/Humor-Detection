I live less than a mile from this Bashas' and they have covered parking, yet I'm compelled to carry an ice chest with me...into the store.\n\nAt any given time, they will have two checkers.  One will be fast and one will be slow.  The fast checker will inevitably also be in charge of manning the self-check stations.  So depending on how many techno geniuses are attempting to scan a bell pepper, the fast lane may become the slow lane.  The slow checker will be painfully slow and try to engage in idle chit-chat which makes them even slower.  There are no baggers at Bashas' anymore either.\n\nSo expect your ice cream (which better be the last thing you put in your cart) to be melted before you ever leave the store.  Or bring in that ice chest.
