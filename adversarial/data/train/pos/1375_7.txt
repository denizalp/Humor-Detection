Come on Pirates!  Joint has potential, freezer case fries are tolerable, but the over-fried\/battered tasteless Mrs. Paul's wanabe is not worth the price nor the visit.  After getting my order, reluctantly wishing to enjoy this 'fishy' meal got worse with the totally filthy seating\/eating area - dirty and grungy floors, grimy tables, unwiped doorway and a trash can you don't want to go near to put trash into!  Health department where are you?  If you don't believe me, see my pics.  My re-visiting this place is best described in the words of the Raven: 'nevermore'!
