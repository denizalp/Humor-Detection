Well,if you like goth\/industrial\/80's this is sadly the only game in town.\ndon't get me wrong,I like the club fine.\nStaff has always been respectful and even nice.\nClub is beautifully appointed,neat,clean and comfy.\nEasy peasy parking.\nSound system..Well it IS a Funktion One after all.\nThat alone is worth the 5.00 cover.\nThe DJ can be spotty hit and miss,but when it's the only game in town,it is what it is.\nI've found the set lists on Fridays more enjoyable.It's all about what you like I guess.Everyone's going to have a different opinion.\nHere's why I knocked off a star,maybe it's not the fairest star I've ever knocked off a review,but here it is.\nI go. I dance.I go home.\nI don't fuck with anyone,I don't expect anyone to fuck with me.\nI don't do drama and am most content being a G.D.I.\nSo,why do some of the chicks there try and give me shit?I have no fucking clue.\nI guess they're just insecure.\nI find it comical when I get cock blocked on the off chance some random guy dances anywhere near me.\nDear hose bag,if he's got more eyeliner on than you,he's not going home with you either idiot.He's going home with some other emo boi.But you just keep living the dream.\nI'm just dancing.That's it.Dancing.\nSo leave me the fuck alone and go have drama with someone else.I'm not for it.\nOne star knocked off for the amount of self important assholes who think for whatever reason,they own the deed to this place.\nThis is why I wish there was at least one other option.
