There's a big upside to hanging with a set who have a twist & shout acumen, especially when it's your birthday. \"I just want the best jukebox you know of. Doesn't matter what. Or where.\" \n\nThen. Through the lovely, shimmery snow flakes we walked out to the west end, down Dundas. As a traveler, a trek like this is even more memorable. \n\nThe outdoor sandwich board \"Japanese Rockabilly.\" Well then. \n\nThe notes are fact: this is a mighty juke. Original build. Handwritten tunes. Singles. 45s. 25Â¢ a track. Just enough space for three person juke jiving. I honestly couldn't ask for a better place to wind down a birthday. The tables are limited on the perimeter and the bar seats five or six. There are motorcycle head lamps on the tap. There's a spirited Japanese guy tending bar, who has patience. And I don't know the Rockabilly crowd in Toronto, but in the states they can be austere & off putting with their commitment to their look so much it can make you feel out of place. Not here. There's no reason not to twist & shout your way here.
