Located in the W Hotel in Old Town Scottsdale, this hipster hangout is always busy.  I recommend a reservation if you're planning to dine here.  The Better Half and I drop in here from time to time.  Since I don't eat Sushi, I order:\n\nJi-Dori Chicken Skewers withTeriyaki Sauce - $10\nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/DwP10iEz5LGf3fhcVQZm0Q?select=x_60nAIMvJX9k_s9HAPiOA\n\nFilet Mignon wrapped Asparagus with Soy Mirin Sauce - $15\nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/DwP10iEz5LGf3fhcVQZm0Q?select=19cHPtx8ahwZTPC5xIARFQ\nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/DwP10iEz5LGf3fhcVQZm0Q?select=_4XhXTuYKQnypHmylm-mQg\n\nAnd for Dessert, a warm Chocolate Cake...yum!\nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/DwP10iEz5LGf3fhcVQZm0Q?select=KoyBtoSTBrhM2dLD8zs_PA\nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/DwP10iEz5LGf3fhcVQZm0Q?select=iKBiwthdGtENIqWfGK1V1A\n\nThe Chicken Skewers are very tasty.  The Teriyaki Sauce they are glazed are sweet and have the right amount of \"sour\" kick to it to balance the flavor.  The Filet Mignon wrapped Asparagus is awesome...the Filet is tender and juicy and the Asparagus compliments it well.  Of course, the Chocolate Cake dessert is a nice ending for the meal.\n\nThe service can be a bit slow at times, depends on the server.  Generally speaking, it's pretty good considering how busy they are.\n\nThe people watching here is pretty good...watching all of the hipsters is hilarious.\n\nReturn Factor - 93%
