Waited half an hour I think... for a party of 5 (NOT BAD) for frozen hot chocolate. Wanted to see what the hype was about... Never had frozen hot chocolate nor been to Serendipity for that matter, so it was a must try when I went to Vega$$$. We already ate some Secret Pizza for dinner beforehand, so I wasn't all that hungry. My other two friends had some kind of sandwich (it was HUGE btw) with sunny side up eggs, bacon and some sort of meat in between. They said it had no taste and wasn't good which was surprising to me 'cause I love sunny side up eggs and bacon hahah. We sat at the bar and for some reason our waiter gave us a complimentary order of onion rings. He never really stated why. I assume, extra\/wrong order? But whatevz, it was sooo bomb. Super crispy and flavorful. \n\nAs for the frozen hot chocolate, it was mediocre and kinda tasted like a chocolate shake but not as thick. but it was way too big for me to finish on my own, so I had to share amongst my friends. Don't think I LOVE(d) it, but it was good. But if we had waited an hour for that, I don't think it'd be worth it. Unless I'm actually sitting down to eat as well. The food seems decent. But there's also mixed reviews on them. The vodka ravioli looks yummy. Wonder if that's any good...and the other desserts sounded so yummy as well. Will def come back to try if the wait isn't long. Or else I'll just hit up the take-out window. \n\nThe place is cutesy and the food seems to come in big portions but I'll def have to come back in order to like it more. All the hype kinda killed it for me, imo.\n\n3\/5. Next time around I hope to bump it up to a 4 :o)
