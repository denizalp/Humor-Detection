There's also Bake Share (where you split your croissants with someone) and Broke Share (where people who spent too much money on rented bikes tell each other their woes). This is not those.\n\nWhat a brilliant idea. If the bicycles themselves were more comfy, I'd give them a 5. I've used them in the heat of summer and the bitterest cold winter, and I bet you can't guess which one feels better. Yeah, don't use these when the temperature is below freezing. It's just awful. Unless you're bundled up like a motherf***** anyway.\n\nBut yes, what a brilliant idea. Not too expensive. Accessible. Helpful, especially in a city like Toronto. But not very comfy to sit on, is all.
