Was out in the area and needed to bring home a quick and reliable meal around dinner time.  DT has pretty much never ever failed me. EVER!  That was until......I came to this place.\n\nNot a lot of vehicles in the drive-thru so I thought I scored.  Rolling up to the squawk box, I was patient with the not so pleasant order taker.  The order was made in quick fashion.\n\nI rolled around to the window and after stopping immediately felt tension radiating out from the window.  Awkward tension....anger tension.  I tried to engage the order taker but they were really having none of it.  I watched as my chow was thrown into a bag and brought towards me.  No stop at the sauce tray, no asking what sauce I wanted.  Figuring the food had already been made and not having to fear any retaliation, I asked for sauce.  Sauce and attitude.......yummy.\n\nNow I don't live around the corner but I don't live that far away.  The 215 makes for a quick trip back to the casa.  When I arrived and threw the spread out on the kitchen table, my quesadilla landed like a folded up frisbee.  In retrospect a frisbee might taste like my quesadilla did.  My bean burritos looked like who ever made them was trying to choke them.  The choking killed them....no heart and no substance.\n\nKnowing what I know now.....there are a few other locations in the relative immediate area.  This one is off the radar and I will seek out those alternate locations in the future.
