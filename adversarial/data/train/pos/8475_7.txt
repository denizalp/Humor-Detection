After a night out in Vegas, the last thing you want to do is travel far to find breakfast so you make your way downstairs and voila! The Coffee Shop greets you near the base of the T.I. elevators. I never expect great things out of the casino's cafe but it usually does enough to hit the spot. The Coffee Shop lived up to my expectation and neither impressed nor irritated me. \n\nI ended up deciding that a sandwich sounded more appealing than breakfast since it was after noon by the time we stumbled downstairs. I chose the French dip with a side of fries. The sandwich was good but not the best I've ever had. I asked for a side of ranch and our wonderful waiter, whose name I meant to remember but have now forgotten, brought me a huge bowl of ranch. He knows the way to my ranch-loving heart! \n\nMy friends ordered an assortment of breakfast and lunch items. I heard that the omelette wasn't great but the oatmeal was pretty good. Our waiter further impressed us by offering to split the bill five ways, which made our lives much easier. \n\nAt $21 with tax and tip, it's way more than I think the sandwich was worth but I guess that's the price you pay in Vegas for convenience.
