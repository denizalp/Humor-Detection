Pittsburgh is only about 10 years behind the \"create your own salad\" grab and go places, but leave it to Eat n' Park to perfect it in the city!\n\nIt's pure chaos in here!  Slightly organized chaos, but chaos none-the-less.  It's not the well oiled machine I imagine it will be, but I think that's why they opened up during the summer \"off\" months when Pitt's not in session.  I think the work crowd is a good test though, because it was still packed around 1:15pm.  \n\nI ordered the Caribbean Shrimp which had mixed Greens, shrimp, avocado, black beans, corn, tortilla strips with citrus lime vinaigrette dressing.  I loved that you can get it chopped up into smaller pieces, they'll toss it in a big bowl with the dressing.  My godsend, they ask you if you want heavy dressing!!!  Yes, please!!!  It was a great salad and far from boring.  The dressing really made the salad, that and the ample amount of ingredients.   \n\nThe real clincher was the, wait for it, BOYLAN SODA MACHINE!!!!!!!!  Dear God I love Boylan Cream Soda!  I had to stop myself from going up 10x.  Completely unique and a fantastic addition to an already stand out place.  \n\nI joked to my friend I probably won't be back until next summer since it will most definitely be jam packed with students once schools in session.  But maybe I can squeeze in a little visit during fall break.  I don't think I can wait that long to come back!
