Came here after a long vegas night, we were so hungry! \n\nYou get to ride the elevator inside the coke bottle to get here, it's pretty cool!\n\nIt wasn't very busy, we were seated right away and ordered. We ordered a burger and bacon cheese fries. \n\nEverything came quick and was pretty good- just the usually greasy fast food type of food. \n\nIt wasn't very flavorful but I feel like I would respect anything crazy from this place.\n\nGood service, alright food and reasonable price.
