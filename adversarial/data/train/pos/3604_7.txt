****Updated 2\/9\/18 from 3 stars to 1...reason being the manager that commented on my review told me the excuse for the food not being really tasty is because it's healthy & vegan...wow. No, sorry, dude- but I've been to plenty of vegan restaurants over the years and had amazing healthy flavorful vegan dishes. So not only will I not be trying something off your regular menu, I will now never be coming back. You are very offensive and unprofessional.\n\n\n\n\nI recently had an early dinner here. \nI had heard various reviews of their vegan sushi options for a long time and decided I wanted to try it for myself. \nThe usual sushi place I eat at close to home is a bit pricey and I just wanted to change up the flavors a bit. \nKabuki is a trendy place, busy, buzzing with activity, and since it is in town Square - not as casual as my neighborhood joint. \nI did like the selection on their veggie sushi menu.I tried a few items like the tofu and crispy rice and some veggie sushi. While they were creative in the making, the flavors did not knock me off my seat. They were just so -so. So nothing I would crave specifically to drive here in order. \nThe service was good, the waiter was friendly enough and he made sure we had refills on our drinks. The sushi chefs were not very entertaining, seemed a bit young and not masters at their skill quite yet.\nThat being said, if I happen to be in town square and I'm hungry I would possibly eat at kabuki again. But I certainly wouldn't drive out of my way to come eat here.
