I've only been here for drinks, and though tiki drinks are typically too sweet for me, I found lovely bitter libations I loved here and had tons of fun. I like the chill yet festive decor, they really did a good job with the nautical vibe, and it was a pleasure to sit here with the front wide open watching the people roll by during a street fest in the summer. I think it'll be even better in the winter when it's cozy and tropical inside and an ice storm dystopia outside. Ah, Quebec, je t'aime.
