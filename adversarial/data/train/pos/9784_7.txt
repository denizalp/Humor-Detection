Fear's is like the little oddball chocolatier of your dreams.\n\nThe quaint location on Madison Avenue is unassuming. You'd never know that inside is an overwhelming amount of nerd candies waiting for you. At first, I went in expecting to walk out with a little treat or two. Ha! Boy, was I wrong on that. Once you start looking really closely at the Millennium Falcons, Yodas, etc. up close, you're so entranced by the intricacy, you'll find yourself filling a box quickly. The Star Wars chocolates are surprisingly detail oriented... its amazing, really.\n\nI picked up a few Star Wars chocolates for gifts, and chose a chocolate covered Oreo and a piece of milk chocolate for myself. Omggg. You know that taste sensation you get when chocolate is really, really well-made? That will happen to you with every bite of a Fear's chocolate.\n\nThis is such a charming and wonderful store, and the owner, Cassandra is a total doll. You'll often see Fear's popping up at local events and festivals... and I love that! Their confections are super affordable and worth waiting in any line.
