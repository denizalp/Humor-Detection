I don't know about you...\n\nBut for me, this year Lowe's Toronto Christmas Market is the best.\n\nGo during the weekend - I know there are a lot and a lot of people... \n\nDon't drive - take the TTC, the parking can be crazy but you can always pay $20 for valet parking\n\nCome here on the weekend to samples all these beers, liquors, whiskey, scotch and more. I ended up sampling Tyskie, Amarula, Frangelico, Calvados, Luksusowa, Innis & Gunn, Tullamore and Irish Mist in a coffee, 12\/15\/18 year Glenfiddich... In a hour.... Lines for sampling definitely moving fast!\n\nIf you are not a drinker, there are also coffee and chocolate milk sample for the kids!\n\nMatt Dusk on the stage at 7 pm to sing some Jazz and Christmas songs..\n\nThe open fire pits kept me so warm and toasty..\n\nAvoid the food lines...that's definitely much better food somewhere else.\n\nFree admission, free tastings, free entertainments - Happy Holidays to all!!
