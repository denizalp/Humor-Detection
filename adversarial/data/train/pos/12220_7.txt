Standard \"Chinese-Canadian\" mall food at Beaches prices is how I sum up this place. Almost everything is deep fried and covered in red sauce. I've eaten their food on several occasions due to it's next door proximity to my friends place and my random need to eat. The food is blah and seasoned to only the most delicate WASP palate.\n\nYou could bring your great-great-grandmother here so she could taste the orient and she would be pleased, however to my own fault I haven't liked \"Chinese\" food like this since I was 4 years old and would try to drink the red sauce straight. \n\nWhat I find most offensive about this place is that they don't have deep fried chilli squid... The staple of almost another place like this and when you ask for it they look at you sideways and say \"NO SQUID\"
