I love sushi.  I think this is a great modern restaurant in a hip and up and coming area of the city.  For starters I stopped by the bar to wait for the rest of my party.  I had the cucumber crisp martini and it was so good.  The bartender cautioned that it was mostly vodka with some muddled cucumbers and a little simple syrup, so that makes it not too sweet.  It was so refreshing and a great start.  The bartender was also fabulous and had I not been meeting a big party, I would have dined with him at the bar top.  \n\nWhen our party all arrived we were seated and ordered a variety of apps.  The calamari and beef tataki were my favorites.  The calamari is flash fried with sauce drizzled on the top.  It has a touch of spice to it and heat on the back end, which I loved.  The beef tataki was seared perfect, but it did have some cajun type spices on the outside which I wasn't crazy over.  But the sliced cucumbers on the plate with it were amazing.  They were drenched in ponzu sauce and if I had been at home I would have licked that plate!  For the main course I chose the Christmas roll (topped with shrimp and avacado) and also a few pieces of nigiri.  Overall the food and service was great.  Everything is decently priced and in keeping with other sushi restaurants in the city.  The atmosphere is great and we went on a Sunday, which wasn't too crowded.  But during weekend nights I can see it getting quite crowded.  Overall a great place for food and drinks!
