\" Ride like the wind, Bullseye! \" - Woody \n\nWatching Toy Story 2 too many times definitely brought out the Cowgirl side of me, YEE-HAW! After arriving in Arizona, I wasted no time in booking my Horseback riding adventure.\n\nPonderosa Stables was something right out of an Old Western Clint Eastwood movie with it's resemblance of an Old Ghost town from the late 19th century era. Impressive.\n\nReady to ride with my laced up boots and sombrero, the only thing left was to saddle on up. Squirrel was his name but I referred to him as Mr. Ed.\n\nGiddy up Horsey! We rode off into the Sunset to the Southern Mountains, feeling a worlds away with nothing but spectacular views of the Sonoran deserts scenery in front of us. So calm and peaceful with the only sound coming from the Bonanza theme song playing in my head.\n\nThe two hours came and went, it was more than just a ride, it was an unforgettable experience, amazing from beginning to end.\n\nUntil we meet again, Mr. Ed.
