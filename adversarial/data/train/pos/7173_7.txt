The husband and I just had some BOMB fish & chips at Sean Patrick's. Well, the fish was bomb. I'm not a fan of seasoned French fries, especially with fish - it just doesn't make sense to me. The coleslaw was clearly not fresh, so I didn't touch the tartar sauce - but the fish - oh the fish! The cod was slight and flaky wish an intense crisp to every bite. The batter was so thin you barely noticed it, except for the beautiful crunch. Light, well-seasoned and begging me to come back for more, it was. \n\nWe sat outside on the patio, the oversized chairs and tables were comfortable but a bit large for just two...would be perfect with a group of friends. The waitress was very friendly and rushed to get our happy hour order in before the time period ended in five five minutes - which was awesome, $3.50 for a Jameson and ginger? Yes please! \n\nI'm leaving off a full star because when we walked in it was very confusing as to if we set ourselves or not. Also for it being a relatively new building, it smelled like people have been smoking in there for at least 40 years. \n\nWe'll be back for that fish. It delighted our tastebuds for sure. We'll make it between 5-7 any day of the week to catch that happy hour, too!
