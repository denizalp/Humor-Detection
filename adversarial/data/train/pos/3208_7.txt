I don't come to this side of town often, but as soon as I decided to meet my friend with the big fat Greek appetite I knew we would be coming here.  Great Greek is certainly where it's at for gyros! \n\nA hearty portion of wonderfully flavored beef\/lamb meat is sliced thick and surrounded by a warm fluffy pita (the kind you'd feel comfortable resting your head upon if you weren't ready to devour it) in this truly special gyro!  I'm not sure if I would bestow it with the title of best gyro in the valley, but it is certainly one of the best. ... add some Feta Fries and a Greek Salad if you brought your beast appetite... or just want to save some for later because both are great options here. I tried some of my friends Avgolemono Soup...another great addition!\n\nI haven't had the opportunity to try any of their other dishes, but I would order whatever I was in the mood for with confidence based on the quality of what I had.
