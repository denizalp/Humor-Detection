Ruder than rude. Use the bathroom was no toilet paper. Pull over here for 2 nights while traveling. Daytime manager told us to leave and never come back we bothered nobody were quiet as can be and we were not there the whole time. We only stayed at night until we're ready to continue our travels. He said its for trucks only. Didn't realize at age 51 and traveling all over the United States that truck stops were for trucks only.  Service there are rude. Very poor service dirty bathrooms. Were approached by a truck driver to know if we knew where to buy drugs. Dennys is another story we ate there and they were very poorly staffed and very poor service. I would never ever step foot in this place again and spend my money here. And when I say that I really really do it. I come from a very high background of government customer service and I would never tell my enemies to ever come here
