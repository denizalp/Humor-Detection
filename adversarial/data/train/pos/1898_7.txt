On a Monday afternoon I'm ready for a new dinning experience in a NEW Restaurant.  Walking in to Doan's today I am welcomed by one of the young men working here and he actually used the words \"welcome to Doan's\", a young lady seated me and asked if I had eaten Vietnamese before, made a few suggestions and let me look over the menu.  I asked some questions and ordered my first dish!\n\nThis IS a REAL Meatball!  EXCELLENT! ! !  In so few words: Doan's Meatballs beats all the others, with one exceptional \"TIE\" for first place!  These skewered Meatballs have the Perfect Flavor and they are the rounded type though they are built small so they are cooked as well as the unmentioned-by-name \"Flat\" version that I also love!  For the Vietnamese Meatballs an easy 5 yelp stars until I can give more... alright 6 yelp stars!\n\nToday was their official \"Opening\" and my waitress said the Chef may not have every dish perfected so she did not strongly recommend the first dish I really wanted to check out!  Spicy Lemongrass with Beef is my first entree!  If I had never eaten at \"Lang Van\" or \"Ben Thanh\" I would say Doan's has the Best!  For now (remember this is based on my \"opening day\" experience) Doan's has everyone \"else\" beat on this dish!  Since I have eaten this dish at five other places I can say Doan's Spicy Lemongrass with Beef is a unique and Very Delicious version!  Tender Beef Stir-fried with white Onion and Carrots (minus the Bell Peppers at my request) served with an almost \"Sticky Rice\" great for showing off my Chopstick skills.  This dish gets 4.75 yelp stars!  The \"spicy\" in \"Spicy Lemongrass\" was flavorful, though not as spicy as I expected and you can request this dish to be spicier!\n\nNext I order Dessert!  \nIf you like Coffee and if you like sweet and creamy Coffee and if you have never experienced Vietnamese Coffee, you are in for a TREAT!  The Brewing process is finished at you table!  When you see the drips stop \"dripping\" push the plunger down to get the last ten or so drops out!  Remove the \"dripper\/brewer\/canister\/filter and stir!  Sweetened Condensed Milk is on the bottom... Drink hot or as I do take a few sips (I have never added anything to this perfect Dessert ANYWHERE!  By taking a taste you can decide if you would like it sweeter or creamier or both - Next, if you like, Pour it over Ice and take a few more sips!  Here is the last suggestion for this style Coffee, my favorite dessert at a Vietnamese restaurant... Place your straw at the very bottom of the ice-filled glass and take a few sips, you should be noticing a warmer (cooler at the top warmer at the bottom of the glass) creamier and dreamier flavor (I'm ready for a nap every time I drink one of these and right now half of the staff of my brain is on strike and the other third is on vacation)!  Vietnamese style Coffee is, I guess easy to get right!  Everywhere I have ordered it I have enjoyed it and it seems almost identical in each restaurant.  An EASY 5 yelp stars!\n\nSecond Entree :  \n\"Bun To\" (Vermicelli) with two sliced Spring Rolls and Grilled Pork!  This dish was GREAT!  Every time I get this dish I like eating some of the components of the dish plain and by themselves, to check out the flavor, then I like dipping each in Fish Sauce and comparing flavors before pouring the fish sauce over everything stirring the dish and eating everything combined... I rate each part of this dish 5 yelp stars, except the pork and it gets very close to 5 stars!\n\nLimeade, Orangeade, Avocado Smoothie and Vietnamese Style Coffee were Fantastic!\n\nNo MSG!  \nThe menu has printed on each page \"No MSG\"!  That is Very important to some of you and might be getting MORE important to many of us!\n\nStaff (I met five of them today) are friendly, welcoming, attentive, POLITE, kind and helpful!  An EASY five yelp stars on service!\n\nSmashes the other Vietnamese Restaurants on South Boulevard! !! !!!  I have been to the other places located close by (on South Blvd., no need to name names) each one three times and will probably never review nor return to these \"other places\" because they are not as good!  Doan's Menu Boasts \"Charlotte's Finest Authentic Vietnamese Cuisine\", I'm ready to give them more than a second look because this was great AND it was \"Opening Day\"!\n\nOn the inside this place is nice looking!  Nicer than most Vietnamese places and EXTREMELY nice for the neighborhood!  You will probably not want to hang out in the parking lot, though you could be in many rougher areas of our fine City... As always, Be Aware of your surroundings! \n\nLOCATION :  : South of Tyvola, on South Blvd., in the Shopping Center with Food Lion and Family Dollar!
