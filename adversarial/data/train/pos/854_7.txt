Upon entering the business we waited at the entrance as the staff stared at us. My daughter went to ask if we need to wait to be seated and she was told to sit anywhere. There was no sign or hostess at the door indicating to seat yourself. Once seated, i asked for a drink menu and was told we dont got one. They have a full bar with beers on tap with no drink or beer menu? After ordering one ice tea we decided to leave. While the waiter went to get the bill for the iced tea i just left $5 on the table and left. Will not be coming back.
