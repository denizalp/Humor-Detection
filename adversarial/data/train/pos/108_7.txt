There's just something about getting on an elevator to go to a restaurant. I like it. I don't know why. Well, color me excited that Elevation is located on the 25th floor of the Oliver Building. Upon exiting the elevators I was greeted with a pleasant, modern, hotel lobby vibe. Good thing, considering I was in the [Embassy Suites] hotel lobby; and just around the corner was Elevation.  \n\nThe hostess was kind and welcoming, and sat our party of four immediately. Elevation's menu made for a tough lunch-time decision, as I really wanted to try a bit of everything. Me and the fabulous Kristin W. agreed to go splitsies on the Crab Cake Salad and the Grilled Vegetable Sandwich.  The former was a huge plate of romaine, a few slices of avocado, a bit of tomato and one crab cake. While the crab cake was good, for a salad of that size (and price\/$15), I might expect two instead. Not a deal-breaker, but worth mentioning. The sandwich was exceptional. The grilled veggies were melted together with provolone on a whole wheat ciabatta bun SO good I'm dedicated to tracking down the bakery from whence it came. The sandwich was accompanied by a nice handful of seasoned fries and, at $10 for the combo, pretty cheap! We also indulged in two desserts - the Hummingbird Cake, a southern spice cake with cream cheese icing and the Housemade Cookie Platter. Honestly, I'd pass on both and maybe try one of their other creations. Neither of these two were all that noteworthy, in my humble opinion.  \n\nThough our server was a bit strange, our overall experience was great! Next time I'm opting for the Fried Catfish Sandwich. Looked delicious and, at $8, I can afford to eat every day. I won't - but I COULD, and that's what's important.
