I just rolled into Madison for a conference, and I was tired, and looking for a place close to my hotel. So at that moment, I wasn't picky.\n\nThis place surpassed my expectations - the food was quite good - it's sort of caribbean-influenced american. It has great sweet potato fries, and a nice broad menu. The food was good, the service was attentive but not rushed (nice balance). \n\nI didn't have them, but they had pretty inexpensive crab legs, that the people next to me seemed to be enjoying.
