Amanda was a life saver. Sure you dont expect to really get help (or at least I dont) BUT Amanda totally came through for me today! Heres m scenario: I buy pedigree healthy digestion for my 3 dogs...it comes in a can..recently all my supermarkets have pulled my particular brand..I decided to buy it online as it is STILL available with online purchasing...I used a company a month ago(i have 3 small dogs and it took me a month to use all 12 cans) BUT my mistake was going to AMAZON(worst company ever) because they had the dog food at a cheaper price,,,and guess what the order NEVER SHIPPED they had a hold on my discover card for paying them as the order was still being processed and not being shipped(i guess thats how amazon does business...shady in my opinion). I called amazon and after about 15 min of going back and forth with someone named martin the order was finally cancelled and I called Discover(ive been with them since 2008..never late once on a payment and always pay ahead of my billing date) to let them know they finally cancelled the order and to make sure i was not charged for  a product i never received.   NO i will never use amazon again...sorry I can spend my money on website that actually ship products that i order ...and I will continue to have faith in Discover as Amanda was super helpful, kind, patient and assured me everything was taken care of on my end...I sincerely hop amazon.com imporoves their shipping process and is better to their other customers because i will not be using them ever again!\nThanks Amanda and Discover  for looking out for me and my account and making sure amazon didnt try and pull a fast one thinking they can just charge me for items i never received.\nThanks again Amanda and Discover card
