I've been a fan of Marco's Pizza since I lived near one in Texas. The management at this particular location has been great about reaching out and cultivating relationships with local schools- fundraisers, discounts for school orders, etc. and they've been easy to work with.\n\nTheir pizza isn't as greasy as other spots, which I really appreciate. Of course, you can cancel that out by asking for their garlic butter crust dip, which I will probably have to use hypnotism in order to avoid in the future. They also offer more than just 'za, with sandwiches, wings, and surprisingly fresh salads. We'll be using Marco's for a department lunch again soon!
