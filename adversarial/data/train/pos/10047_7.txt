I researched quite a few bike shops before I went in to Bike World. I had in mind what I wanted and was doing an upgrade to my current bike. I was hesitant where to start since the reviews were so varied, and I was dreading dealing with potentially non helpful sales people. This was not the case!  I was greeted immediately and directed to Javier. He was sensational. He listened to what I was looking for, explained certain specifications as questions arose, in simple terms. He was very patient as I test drove over 5 models each one improving from the last decision until we fine tuned into  the perfect bike that I am now in love with!\n   I wanted a smooth, quiet comfortable ride for hour long exercising sessions that would allow frequent shifting for hills and dales. I got a Haro Heartland Sport model women's bike. I honestly didn't care what color it was, so to have it in white with purple to pink trim was a bonus.  It corners like a dream, going up hills that were challenging in the past were almost effortless. The brakes are responsive & crisp. Javier showed me how to adjust the handlebar height and angle, and made it into something very comfortable for me. He also took time out to show me how to take off the front tire and put it back on for easier loading into the car. He fine tuned everything and told me to bring it back in a month for another safety check. He even threw in a nice big white basket on the front for all of my accessories. To say that I am a very satisfied customer is an understatement. I love this place and will be back. They also quickly repaired a flat for my husbands bike too. My other riding partner was so impressed with the ride and the service and price, she is going to get the same model. She couldn't believe all that came with the bike. They went out of there way to make my shopping experience as pleasant as it could be. Thank you again, you really made my day and my rides a lot easier. Sincerely Eva Dahl
