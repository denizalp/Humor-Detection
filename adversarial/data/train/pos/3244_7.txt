Expensive drinks? No big deal. Almost 100% hipster crowd? Fine. The problem here is the way the management treats its customers. We sat at a table upstairs at 9:00 PM. At 11:20 we were asked to move to another table. We complied and five minutes later were asked to give up the actual table. Two minutes later they came and took our chairs. Simple as that. I won't be back and I was embarassed to have taken my out of town guest there.
