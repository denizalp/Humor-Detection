This place should be avoided at all costs.\n\nLuckily, I was not subjected to the food, but I came here for lunch whilst my two co-workers wanted to try a sandwich.\n\nThe owner\/manager was making sandwiches with one rubber gloved hand and the other hand (not gloved) holding his cell phone while he spoke in Italian for the entire 20 minutes we were waiting. He took orders in between chatting on the phone and never once put it down.\n\nOne co-worker was given her sandwich immediately and we waited patiently for the second. Waiting...waiting...more waiting. After 10 minutes we enquired about the second sandwich. Oops. He forgot about it.\n\nTo top off the experience, both claim the sandwiches were fairly horrible. Roast beef consisted of: HUGE bun, not enough roast beef and way too much mustard.\n\nGood thing I didn't eat here.
