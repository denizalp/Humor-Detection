When you visit Vegas, you expect amazing service and food - this was a huge disappointment.  It's a large open space with no identity or vibe to it, lacking an actual sushi bar. Rolls are micro sized and sashimi cuts were fit for a 5 year old. Have no clue how this place stays in business and I would never return.\n\nStep it up Aria! This place needs to go.
