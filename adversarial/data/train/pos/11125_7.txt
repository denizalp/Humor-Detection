I've been here many times over the past few months and have tried their Appetizer Sampler (Sliders, Artichoke\/Spinach Dip, Boneless Wings) and Classic Breakfast (2 Eggs, Toast, Breakfast Potatoes, Bacon) dishes.\nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/fDe1ZAfFfeV70ngBdG9gog?select=DPRfi8hFYN_ep6YxCd7oRw\nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/fDe1ZAfFfeV70ngBdG9gog?select=H0rl4_E86CYMV98m2bVbDA\n\nThe food is decent, but not great.  Since Phoenix has very limited food choices at the airport, I like Chili's Too out of all the other options.\n\nThe service here is borderline terrible though, the employees are not very friendly and their really slow!\n\n.....overall, I'd give it 2.5 Stars, but rounding up because I'm in a good mood today.\n\nReturn Factor - 75%
