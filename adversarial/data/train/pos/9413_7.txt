Sushi Neko now occupies the spot Shuseki used to be. Came in before 4:00 PM and was able to score the lunch menu price of $20.95 AYCE sushi! Pretty good value considering it includes a variety of appetizers and choice of dessert. \n\nAPPETIZERS\nFried rice - nothing special. \nShrimp tempura - yummy! Hard to mess up. \nPang - crab mix on top a crunchy, buttery toast.\nEgg rolls - Super oily. Did not care for the filling.\n\nSUSHI\nNigiri is pretty good here with great fish to rice ratio. It is true that the garlic ponzu sauce is awesome. They have sushi burritos listed on the menu. I ordered the hulk burrito (soy paper) and I got a regular cut roll with seaweed paper. Umm...lol. I'm not big on rolls, but they offer 1\/2 rolls! I tried the lemon roll and the Chanel roll. I've had a better lemon roll, but I would get the Chanel roll again. \n\nDESSERT \nSounds good on paper, but it was just okay for me. The desserts are on the small side and nothing really stood out. The green tea panna cotta is probably the best choice, but not mind blowing. The mini honey toast is definitely \"mini.\" It's basically the size of a Hawaiian roll. Sad that the toast was burnt and the vanilla ice cream was more icy than creamy. \n\nI loved the interior and the service was great!\n\n\n*****Yelp 2016 100 review challenge*****\n9\/100
