He's not a tattoo artist. Think before you ink. Don't come here. He is not business professional and he doesn't respect his customers. As a women we've gone thru enough battles with our bodies and here we are, getting the courage to cover our scars so that we may have confidence again.\n\nWe do not need a person like this to hate on us, talk down to us, and disrespect us. An artist like that is not an artist but merely an imitator. \n\nI wouldn't spend money here. A person that gives no respect won't gain any in return. Good luck closing up shop. You've set a nasty reputation for yourself. Talented artists shouldn't stay either, don't get slandered because the owner is reckless and doesn't care.
