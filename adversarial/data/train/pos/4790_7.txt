If it was possible to give no stars, Networks would of earned this honor from me. First off, even with pub crawl happening, the clientel at Networks is your typical hotel bar clientele. Being under 35, and not trying to get laid while at a conference out of town, I felt like an instant outcast. Secondly we came to Networks to take advantage of the pub crawl special of $1 beer and wine but once we made it to the bar we were quickly told it was a misprint and pretty much treated like shit after that. Jason, the \"manager\", strolled over to the bar with a fresh plate of assorted appetizers pizza as most people would call it, with his cheap suit jacket and an earpiece. I am not sure if he felt powerful with the earpiece in but it really helped add to the entire douche vibe. He was short and unaccommodating with our party and not even apologetic for the misprint. Mistakes happen and if Jason was a little bit better of a manager, he could of convinced our party of 8 to stick around and spend some money at his bar even if we did not get the discount we originally thought we would. Jason needs to remove the stick from his ass, the ear piece from his ear, and take a few more management courses before I would even consider returning.
