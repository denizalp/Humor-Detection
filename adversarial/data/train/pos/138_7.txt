What a fantastic atmosphere, a breath of fresh air in the staid Scottsdale sports bar scene. Great bar tender, fresh beers, game food and of course a great place to watch football now matter who your team (although of course it is best if you are  Hawkeye).\n\n\n\nIn response to Karri G., the reviewer ahead of me: It would seem a sports grill may not be the optimal locale for someone with your views to be. \n That uncomfortable feeling you got when a strange woman called you (gasp) \"Sweetie\" was most likey your subconscious reacting to the fact that all who had met you that evening were counting the minutes until you left.\nNext time you find yourself writing a review that begins with \"this may not be a fair review\" you might consider stopping right there.
