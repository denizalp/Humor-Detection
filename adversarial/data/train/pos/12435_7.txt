It's not Hobak but, you know...it's cool.... \nfor around $25 all you can eat dinner, it's good!\n\nCook your own food KBBQ with good portions for my 3-party Valentine's dates.\nwe waited about an hour for dinner, which is pretty standard for KBBQ at most places.\n\nBonchon was ok. Steam egg was one per table. I liked the potato salad. Bulgogi nachos were more like bulgogi on top of the last chips in the bag aka the small broken parts.\nCheese corn was too small: AND they had onions in there, which I really hate. Considering the cheese corn was a small portion, it took quite some time to cook\/melt.\nI will give it to Hwaro for their dessert. The affogato with cereal on top was suuuupppperrrrrr yummy. Prolly my favorite dessert at any KBBQ spot.\n\nLike most other KBBQ places, it's small and crowded. The vents above the grills SUCK. So, you come out of there smelling like KBBQ -- not the worst smell in the world lol\n\nI would come here again (if Hobak was closed) lol
