Highly recommend this place and will be a town crier to elicit business. Finally great fare in our east valley neck of the woods! Run, go now for crazy good food.\nFarm to table salad was amazing and I will order this forevermore. I am eager to see what lands in this dish in autumn. The carribean jerked sea bass was a gastronomic symphony.  \nI may upgrade a star after our next visit. I was so excited about this place beforehand, I want to be objective!
