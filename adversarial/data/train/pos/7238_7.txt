We went to Boba Tree for the first time on a Sunday afternoon, and I ordered a Thai Milk Tea and my wife had the Taro Milk Tea.  Both Teas were well crafted, had rich flavors (without being overly sweet), had fresh boba and just the right amount of ice.  The lady who took our order provided extremely friendly, attentive service.  She took time to answer our questions and read back our final order to make sure everything was correct as ordered.\n\nBoba Tree did not disappoint, and they even offer a loyalty card with 1 free small after 5 purchases and 1 free large after 10.  We can't wait to come back again to try additional menu items.
