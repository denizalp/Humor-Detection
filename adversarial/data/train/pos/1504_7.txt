Seating is a bit limited but I really like how the tables are out in front of the restaurant, almost feels like you are actually sitting outside. It's an adorable, relaxing setting even in the middle of all the chaos. Good choice for a sit-down dinner after walking around the shops.\n\nIt was so hard to choose what to order. I love pasta and everything sounded good to me. Decided on the tortelloni alfredo - creamy, smooth, and very cheesy. Taste-wise, I would have enjoyed it even more if the dish contained some vegetables or chicken. But it was delicious and extremely filling.
