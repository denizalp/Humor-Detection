Been here, stayed here, and eaten here before and loved it. This last visit, not so much. \n\nWent to the M Life Counter to try and redeem MyVegas points early in the morning for breakfast. Upon arriving, with our kids, the wife went off to the side just barely visible to me and not close to any of the machines. Since there was no lines, I was immediately told any MyVegas rewards are not usable during Christmas since it was blacked out. \n\nI was disappointed, but I get that.  What I don't get, is the person on the floor and immediately told my wife and kids to leave since they are underage. Sure, I get that minors should not be allowed on the floor and it's not legal. But since I barely paused for a second to ask the hostess and was rudely told by the gentleman to leave before I can barely finish hearing my vouchers were not valid.....that was totally uncalled for. \n\nSometimes, it's not what you say, it's how you say it...and this time, it could've been told and handled differently.  It didn't sit well with me and I didn't get a chance to voice my concern. So let me tell my fellow Yelpers to please consider twice before coming here if you want to be taken care of.  There are plenty of better options.
