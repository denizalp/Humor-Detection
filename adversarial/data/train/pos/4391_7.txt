I have never been a fan of philly cheesesteaks, ever. I've tried to, but I just never found them to be tasty. But last night I had one from here after leaving the bars and I was amazed! I got it with onions and cheese wiz. It was so filling I'm happy I shared with my bf. The staff was awesome and even hooked me up with a free bag of chips. We played pool while we waited and there wasn't any loud music playing like past reviews stated. I will definitely be returning since I live so close and can be found at the bars once in a while. Apparently they should be getting a liquor license soon, so more incentives to come and try!
