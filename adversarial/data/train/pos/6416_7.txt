I just have to YELP this place reeks with an undeserving attitude!\n\nSince when has the french country aesthetic been accompanied by such an unreasonable terseness?\n\nThis store will no longer have my business - I am formally boycotting it! \n\nAfter being made to feel like a criminal for returning faulty product ...not just once... not twice... but three times - you have to wonder - is this really the consumers fault or is this just a crappy towel set that's sold in a fancy white shop by bitchy women and overpriced in order to create an illusion of quality?!\n\nThe choice is ours as consumers and I will no longer support a store that treats it's clientele with such disrespect and condescension. \n\nHate to say it but when I look into my crystal ball stores like this are a dying breed and  it's only a matter of time before they'll not longer exist.
