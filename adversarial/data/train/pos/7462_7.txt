I had Amelia do my makeup and hair for my wedding this past weekend and she did a phenomenal job. She was so professional and created my total vision all from a picture that I sent her for the hair. I let her roll with what she thought would look good for the makeup and I have never felt more beautiful! My hair and makeup stayed perfect and on all night. \n\nAmelia and 2 other artists ( I wish I could remember their names) also did the makeup and hair for my moms and wedding party. I have never seen everyone look more beautiful! These ladies are complete professionals and if you want to look amazing and have a fun stress free wedding day I would absolutely recommend them to any bride.  Thanks so much!
