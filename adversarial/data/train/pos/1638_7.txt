Decided to give this place another shot and I'm glad I did. They do SNS nails right and even offer nice eyelash extensions at a great price. I no longer live close by but that hasn't stopped me from making the drive. The service also seems nicer, my only suggestion would be to avoid coming during their busy hours. Calling in ahead to find out how long their wait is would be a good idea.
