This is my local Pt's & I love it. The bartenders are seriously the best. Also for some reason their food is always so good. Some nights are better than others depending on the crowd. But I mind my own business, come get a drink and play a little Keno. Overall, the only thing I can complain about is the music. I wish the jukebox had better selections and that they had Champagne :)
