Watch out if you think GC has healthy food.  If you go in and eat only the vegetables, they are soaking in MARGARINE made with hydrogenated soybean oil.  Soy is genetically modified and an endocrine disrupter.  For real butter, you have to ask your server - the \"butter\" they have out is actually margarine.  They use soybean oil for their deep fat frying (but this is not unusual.  \nI thought it was a good place to go, but the brussel sprouts\/carrots\/green beans, etc. are all swimming in margarine - which they determined years ago to have massive trans fats and to be worse than butter.\nIt's good to know that GC will save a few bucks at the cost of their customer's health....
