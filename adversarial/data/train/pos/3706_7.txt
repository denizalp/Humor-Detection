I went here for my friend's birthday at dinner time.  It was 25$ per person after tax.\n\nThe food is godawful.  NOTHING was good.\n\nFrom the mushy uncooked shrimp  to the stickey and low quality crab legs to all the low quality cuts of meat.  It was terrible.\n\nAvoid this place at all costs, go to Mandarin instead.  It's the same price and the quality and food is much better.\n\nonce again DO NOT EAT AT THIS PLACE
