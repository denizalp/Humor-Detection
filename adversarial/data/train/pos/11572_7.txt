The instructor was awesome. This is a really fun thing to do with friends or as a workout. Try it! I read the negative reviews and they are totally over exaggerated lol it's actually funny how over the top they are. I hate that, we use yelp to get REALITY not over exaggerated opinions. The only negative is the place is hard to find but isn't really a big deal in the scheme of things.
