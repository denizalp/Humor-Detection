FINALLY!! A REALLY GOOD **CLEAN** PHO SPOT!!!\n\nI just moved to the area for the Cal-E-Fo-Nay-Yay and in the three months I've been here I've been in pursuit of a default Pho restaraunt. On the verge of giving up of what seemed to be a figment of my imagination, I found this place.... YAY!!!\n\nThe PHO was FANTASTIC! It came in a smaller bowl I was accustomed to but it was a optical illusion because it was a quite satisfactory amount.\n\nThe ambiance was more modern and clean. (Kind of reminded me of a quan nhau... hmmmm now I wonder... lol) \n\nTheir primary server is a young bilingual latina, which I think is genius!!! I don't have to be confused if I'm ordering a orange juice or a manicure... But they of course they also have the traditional Vietnamese servers if that's your cup of tea who are also really nice and helpful. \n\nI'M SO GLAD FOUND THIS SPOT! AND IT'S NOW MY GO TO DEFAULT PHO PLACE! \n\n=)\n\nNOOB TUTORIAL:\n\nit's pronounced \"FUH\" not \"FOE\"
