To whom it may concern, \n\nToday my expecting wife and I, along with our children pulled into the parking lot of store # 6624 in North Las Vegas when we see a male and female employee (in uniform) standing no more than 10 feet from the entrance to the store, smoking. Then as we begin to pull into an \"expecting mother\" parking space, there are shopping carts in all of the available spaces. So I park a few extra spaces beyond as it was 108 degrees today and I did not want to waste anytime in the ridiculous heat. After we load our 3 little children into one of the shopping carts, we head to the door farthest away from the \"smokers\" to find out that the slight breeze is blowing the wind across all the doors and into our faces. No parents, let alone, pregnant mother-to be, should have to breathe this filth. \n\nOnce inside, I go to the customer service desk to speak to a manager and find out that the Store Manager won't be back till next week and that the female \"smoker\" is in fact the Store Assistant Manager, Karen smoking with her employee, Flint.\n\nI hope that Toy's R Us reviews their policies regarding tobacco use and the appropriate smoking locations while on company properties so further guests don't have to become ill due to the odor of the cigerettes. Not very professional!!!\n\nP.S. it's also nice to know that they have enough time to smoke while there are shopping carts obstructing parking spaces.
