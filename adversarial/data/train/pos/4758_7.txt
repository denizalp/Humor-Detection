This is a review for nail services by Jill at Tuscany.\n\nBased on a conversation on the Talk boards about gel nails, I made an appointment with Jill for glitter gel toes.  I've been wanting them for a while and I'm so happy I stumbled across Jill at Tuscany.  She is great, and the salon is conveniently close to home and work.\n\nAll I can say is that my toes freaking ROCK.  They are a gorgeous pink girly glitter that is sparklier than anything I've ever seen on toes!  LOVE THEM!  Love, love, love them.  Thank you, Jill T.!!
