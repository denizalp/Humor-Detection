Scenario: \n\nI stumbled into Office Depot last night 25 minutes to close,  I had previously uploaded a 180 page document that I had prepared to be printed at their competition over the road. As I only gave the competition 6+ hours notice, they charged me a premium and promised a time of 7pm. \n\nWhen I came to collect the print job at 720 I was met with frustration and excuses. \n\nExperience:\nI was greeted by Jake at the print centre who asked how he could help.  I explained my situation and we joked about it.  I asked how long it would take to print it, Jake told me as soon as he get it, he could start but they closed in 26 minutes, he would try. \n\nI realized that my print job was in the cloud and I had no account.  That's ok Jake gave me their email address and he was able to grab my 180 page print job, print, bind, cover and deliver the job in about 12 minutes. \n\nHe even had time to explain how in future I can just email the store my job, be detailed in the instructions and they will let me know when it's ready.  No having to go through a 3rd party account or website. No putting up with a frantic set of excuses for missing deadlines.
