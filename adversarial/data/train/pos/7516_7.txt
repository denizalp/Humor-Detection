They have two kiosk areas in the mall which fill the center of the walking isle, one on either end.  Prior to going here, I went into several stores looking for a pair of glasses and decided to browse the NYS kiosk. \n\nI was greeted by Sheila who was super friendly and well educated on everything sun glasses.  After walking me through several options I decided to buy a pair. \n\nNYS has a good manufacturer guarantee for defects and several locations throughout the United States should you need to return them.
