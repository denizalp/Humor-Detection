I'm really not a bar person.  Dunno why, but I just never went through that phase where I'd meet up with friends, a date...at a bar.  Maybe it's a suburban\/went to a commuter school thing?\n\nAnyway, despite being slightly intimidated by bars, I just *knew* I had to check out Port Credit\/Mississauga's newest hot spot!\n\nMy visit was on a Tuesday night with a coupla old friends for a catch up.  I honestly thought this place would be dead, but the extended Summer weather definitely helped.  Patio was at least 3\/4 full and with the exception of 2-3 tables in the front + the entire back - where the music seemed waaay louder - was pretty much empty.\n\nI think Dufton was our server as per the name on the receipt.  He was very friendly and helpful in narrowing down our decision from the extensive drink menu.  Like the other reviews, there are only a handful of food items on the menu.\n\nI had the Pink Panther ($15) and honestly, that was probably all I was able to tolerate as it's a HUGE drink.  The top note tasted like an alcoholic orange juice, then with a bit of raspberry, so it's a fruitier drink.  Perfect for Summer!  \n\nAs we had a few sips of our cocktails, I wanted to order something to share so server suggested the fries over the mac 'n cheese which was a good call.  Fries were SOOO good, well seasoned\/fried, perfect for sharing.\n\nBeing slightly intoxicated while at this place definitely helped amplify my impression.  Good service also goes a long way!\n\nNote:  Yes, the condensation at the back was apparently my issue.  And the washrooms, towards the back, had some issue as well as the carpet was completely soaked AND it was absolutely freezing back there.  I hope they address this sitch before it begins to freeze over!
