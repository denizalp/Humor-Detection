There's something about going to a club that ALWAYS has people (both women and men) that find you hot.... hehehe.\n\nSo Club 5 gets TOP STARS in my vote.\n\nThe drinks are HELLA cheap, and LOADED (and not with gasoline quality vodka like everywhere in State Street).\n\nThere's PLENTY of dancing area, you dont' have to bump with the person next door.\n\nAnd they play PLENTY of oldies like Madonna and Cher and Tina (isn't it sad that I'm calling Madonna old?  That means I'M old... Well.. Old School that is...\n\nThis is NOT for the prude and conservative (*cough*WIers*cough) as it's a gay club.  But if you want good drinks, good dance, and be able to hang out with MANY of your friends at the same time, this is the place...
