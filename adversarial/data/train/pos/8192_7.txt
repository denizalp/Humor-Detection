The Bar mixes a hell of a caucasian, Jackie. I love the cute Lebowski themed bar. It's small and intimate. The drinks are stiff and decently priced. The food is insane good.... those little sliders served on the cutest round pieces of toast are perfection. They put In N Out burger to shame. They may be my favorite burgers in town (just simple high quality deliciousness). Check out The Bar..... You won't be sorry!\n\n\nBut you know, that's just, like, my opinion, man.
