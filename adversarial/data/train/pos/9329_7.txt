This was the best massage I have ever had in Las Vegas\/Henderson!! I have been to many different massage\/spa places. I have never had someone actually hit ever sore spot on my body. Elliot listened and delivered. I was so pleased that I booked another massage a week from today. I can't begin to THANK him enough. I suffer from headaches that is caused from neck problems. I went there today after work because I was suffering from one of my many headaches. I walked out of there with no headache and feeling like I can move my neck with ease. I will send everyone I know to him. This is a 10 Star rating!
