If you would have asked me a year ago about this place I probably would have had a better review...my oh my, how things have changed.  My husband and I used to be regulars here.  We live close by and would walk up a couple times a week and sit outside for happy hour.  It was our spot.  They knew us and how we operated.  You get seated where they know you like it and sometimes even have your drinks before you order them.  When you spend over $400 a month at a restaurant you typically get think treated right.  We tip well and our servers knew it.\n\nWe returned last night to try it out again and because the weather was nice for walking.  We walked in and saw two open tables in the bar.  It was 5:26pm, just enough time to order a burrito and a couple margaritas.  We were told by the hostess that the tables were reserved.  Huh, who knew you could reserve tables for happy hour in the bar.  You can no longer seat yourself on their out front patio because it is now closed in and under construction...which has been \"under construction\" for some time now. \n\nI could go on and on, but what's the point.  Everyone who knew us as regulars are no longer working there and no one cares about the amount of money we have dropped at this place.  It's just sad.  We never really came here for the food, it was more the experience and now that its gone....there is no reason.\n\nThanks for the good times Tia.  We'll miss what you used to be.
