this strip mall probably has two of the worst restaurants in all of ontario.  paul wongs chinese (see my review) and Kathryn's.\n\nMy mom once again suggested this for lunch and i even mentioned wow it;s in the same strip plaza as paul wongs we had gone to for lunch many years ago that quite frankly was the worst chinese food i ever had.  Could it get any worse. YES it can, Kathryn's is a diner (where the bar part in title comes from don't know, there isn't a bar per se to sit at).  It's complete 80\"s pastel decor, which would be ok if the place was clean and the food tolerable.  Why do people buy a restaurant that was great based on food ( used to be greek owners who knew the food business) if they have no clue first of all how to run a restaurant and second no idea what the food they are cooking should taste like or even have a clue what it is.\n\nThe order:\n\nfish and chips:  frozen fish (asked waitress said it was fresh)  captain high liner type of concoction with fries i think they cooked yesterday and saved them to re-fry.  The fries tasted like fish, so that would say the oil in deep fryer was dirty.\n\nChicken Souvalki on pita with fries, this was the absolute worse meal i think I've had ever and ever.  Rubbery chicken pieces on a stale pita with iceberg lettuce and a few slivers of tomato.\n\nThe poor waitress, (whom i tipped generously) was not in the dark about the quality of food she KNOWS it' s horrendous. \n\nWe spoke to the owner Sophie and she discounted our bill $5 even though we didn't eat merely a bite.\n\nSTAY away.
