As of today, I have dined here 7 times - 3x dinner, 4x lunch.. witnessing various changes to the selection.\n\n::: [ FLAVOR ] ::: \n\nStandard buffets seem to focus heavily on selection\/quantity. Better buffets seem to focus heavily on selection, quantity AND quality. Wicked Spoon might lose in the selection department over others, but focuses on quantity, quality, & one essential but oft overlooked criteria: FLAVOR. \n\n::: [ TECHNIQUE ] :::\n\nDue to preparation of large batches, many buffets (including Wynn's, which I haven't been back to in 2+ yrs) tend to offer food with less desirable textures due to being left out for too long and\/or imperfect cooking temperatures, Wicked Spoon rarely makes that mistake.\n\n::: [ PRESENTATION ] ::: \n\nPerfectly portioned little bowls\/plates. Reduces chance of cross-contamination by other guests and things being mixed around on your own plate. Maintains presentation - consistency in plating technique is a 3.5\/5 - 4\/5 depending on the station & dish.\n\n::: [ SERVICE ] ::: \n\nOnly experienced poor service 2 out of 7 times. Yesterday's visit was excellent - our server randomly checked up on us at least 4 times throughout our meal.\n\n::: [ DRINKS ] ::: \n\nWine & cocktails are available. They also have a selection of Coke products, juices, & ice tea. Don't forget to ask for coffee when you're ready to move on to dessert!\n\n::: [ DIET-FRIENDLY FOOD ] ::: \n\nI've dieted while dining here twice and was able to get extremely full on less than 700 calories. Also, SUGAR-FREE DESSERTS! You can also request a cup of berries from the dessert station.\n\n____________________________\n\nKEY:\n(-) Skip This\n(+) Try This\n(++) Love This\n\nI have either 1.) never tried or 2.) feel indifferent towards the ones that have no symbol next to them. \n____________________________\n\n\nDATE\/TIME: MONDAY, MARCH 25, 2013 \/\/ 7:30PM\n\n::: [ SAMPLE OF THE SPREAD AT DINNER ] :::\n\n\n[ ASIAN ]\n\nEgg Drop Soup\nCabbage Salad\nWok Tossed Udon\nHar Gau\nBeef Stir Fry\nCompart Duroc Pork Ribs (+)\nKorean Kalbi Short Ribs\nSushi\n\n[ ITALIAN ] \n\nDuck Ravioli (++)\nItalian Sausage Pappardelle (++)\nSpaghetti w\/Smothered Cherry Tomatoes\nAsiago Gnocchi w\/Lamb Ragu (++) \/ sometimes chewy, good flavor\nBraised Beef Short Rib w\/Polenta (+)\nMargherita Pizza\nChicken Garlic Pizza\nSausage and Roasted Tomato\nProsciutto Stromboli (+)\nPrime Rib Pannini w\/Truffle Aioli\nBroccoli Rabe w\/Pine Nuts & Garlic Roasted Red Peppers\nCrispy Chicken Thighs w\/Pancetta and Romanesco\n\n\n[ MEAT ETC ]\n\nShepherd's Pie (+) \/ too much potato\nTruffle Potato\nPotatoes au Gratin (++) \/ not there yest but usually\nCreamed Spinach (+)\nRoasted Sweet Potato w\/House-Made Marshmallow\nCarnitas w\/Black Bean & Salsa Fresca\nGreen Garlic Roasted Tomatoes\nPotatoes O'Brien\nVeal Sweetbreads \"Dirty Rice\" (-) \/ missing sweetbreads\nWicked Fried Chicken (-)\nRoasted Chicken\nPrime Rib (+) \/ good quality & texture\nLeg of Lamb\nBone Marrow (++)\nSAUCES: Au Jus, Chimichurri, Horseradish Cream, Red Onion Marmalade\n\n\n[ RANDOM ]\n\nWild Boar Sloppy Joe's (+)\nCitrus Glazed Salmon\nBBQ Shrimp & White Cheddar Grits (+)\nCrab Legs (+)\nCrispy Corn Tacos\n\n\n[ MAC AND CHEESE ]\n\n* This station is always either a Design-Your-Own Mac & Cheese or Shrimp Station.\n\n\n[ COLD FOODS ]\n\nFRUITS: Bananas, Apples, Mandarin\nSquid Chili Gochuchang (+)\nEgg and Candied Bacon Salad\nChopped Salad\nBlistered Vegetable Panzanella\nSmoked Trout Salad w\/Frisee (++)\nMarinated Mushrooms w\/Burrata & Foccacia\nShrimp Ceviche (+)\nShrimp Cocktail\nDeviled Eggs\nWhite Bean and Tuna Crostini w\/Truffle Oil & Parsley\nRoasted Beet Salad w\/Arugula, Goat Cheese, & Sherry Vinaigrette\nKale Salad (++)\nBocconcini Salad\nRoasted Garlic Soup\nSoup Du Jour\nOlives\nCold Cuts\nSmoked Salmon (+)\nPickled Cornichons (+)\nMaytag Bleu Cheese, Brie, Manchego, etc (+)\nCrunchy Pita Bread\nHummus\nTomato and Chickpea Salad\nBaba Gannoush\nTabbouleh (+)\nTzatziki (+)\n\n\n[ DESSERT ]\n\nMolten Chocolate Cake w\/Caramel Sauce (+)\nPeach Cobbler (+)\nChocolate Marshmallow\nFudge\nCarrot Cake (+)\nOpera Cake (+)\nCheesecake (+)\nGodiva Lolli Cakes\nFreshly Baked Cookies: 4 Types\nSweet Potato Flan w\/Toasted Marshmallow & Rosemary Shortbread (+)\nGingerbread Shortcake w\/Eggnog Whip Cream & Milk Chocolate Sauce\nChocolate Covered Strawberries\nSmores Chocolate Pudding w\/Graham Crackers & Melted Marshmallow (+)\nCaramel Apple Streusel Tart (+)\nTiramisu Chocolate Cup (+)\nChocolate Mousse Berries\nSugar Free Chocolate Custard w\/Raspberry Compote (+)\nLow Sugar Vanilla Cream w\/Blueberry Compote\nStrawberry Gazpacho (+)\n\n\n[ DESSERT: GELATO + SORBET ]\n\nMint Chocolate Crunch\nSalted Peanut Caramel\nVanilla\nCoffee White Chocolate (++) \nPistachio\nCaramel Candy Bar\nAlmond Joy\nOreo\nThai Tea (++) \nNutella (++) \nTiramisu\nStraciatella\nStrawberry Balsamic\nRaspberry Sorbet\nMango Passion Sorbet\nBlood Orange Sorbet\nLemon Sorbet (+)\nSugar Free Chocolate\n\n____________________________\n\n\n3\/27\/13: Tried Bacchanal - amazing selection.
