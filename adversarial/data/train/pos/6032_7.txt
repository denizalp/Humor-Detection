Sorry \"y'all\" (which I don't say, but will say for the sake of the south), but I miss Wu's. Many won't agree, and that's ok. I loved it :(. That being said, it was very busy here tonight, 45 min wait. The environment was nice and they played good music. The server was super friendly and I really liked her a lot. She took the order quickly and it and come pretty fast too.\n\nI ordered the Rosemont burger. It was good, it had two patties, but I could've just done one. I got the chili on the side and they forgot my onions, but overall delicious flavor. Not a fan of the chili. The waffle fries weren't that great either, very hard!  The turkey sandwich was overly salty...but it wasn't mine, so that's ok. Mac & cheese is a no. Just didn't have a good taste. \n\nGreat staff!! I will come back to try the nachos and milkshakes. They definitely have better prices than Wu's......but I miss my friend.
