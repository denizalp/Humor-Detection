Four of us went in for Sunday brunch. And let me start by saying I have no issue paying a corkage fee. \n\nSo...We told the server we would like to purchase a bottle of wine and asked for suggestions from their list. The server said you can go into the store and select a bottle of wine of your choice for purchase and then we will serve it to you.  But when we received our bill we had a corkage fee added to our bill. Seriously?  This was a bottle from your store that you basically sell at full retail AND then you charge a corkage fee.  It is only fair to make a profit once... Not twice.  And you should tell your customers in advance that a corkage fee will be applied to an \"ON SITE\" purchase. I would have brought a MUCH better bottle of wine for us to enjoy and paid your corkage fee.  SHAME ON YOU! We will not be back.
