I Sushi has fresh, good quality sushi with unique fusion-style rolls. They are also open late (Until 11 P.M.) on Fridays and Saturdays, which makes for some a good late night dinner!\n\nWe tried the \"monkey brain\" appetizer, a few basic rolls (Salmon, tuna, yellowtail), tuna poke, and the bull roll. The monkey brain is a row of mushrooms stuffed with fresh tuna, then tempura fried. It was drizzled with sauce, and was really delicious. The basic rolls had a good proportion of fish to rice and seaweed, and the fish itself was tasty and fresh. The tuna poke had a tasty marinade, with good proportion of fish to vegetable. Most of the tuna tasted great. However, there were a few pieces I tasted that had some slight gristle on them. The bull roll was amazing. It's one of the best fusion sushi rolls I've had! The presentation is pretty cool too, since the waitress will flambe the aluminum-wrapped roll at your table. As the flames die down, you peel back the wrapping to reveal some nicely grilled bulgolgi beef on top of a spicy tuna, crab, and cucumber roll. It gives a whole new meaning to a surf and turf roll, Asian style!\n\nService was friendly and cheerful. We came in with a Groupon and they had no problem with us redeeming it. If you look on their website, they have coupons you can print out too for some non-Groupon discounts.\n\nI'd definitely like to come here again for the sushi, and perhaps to try their happy hour from 3-7 which includes appetizers, entrees, sushi, and drinks.
