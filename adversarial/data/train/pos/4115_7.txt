Terrible place to get a hair cut, specifically showed the guy a hair style I wanted along with stating leave it long on top, but came out with a military crew cut instead. When I saw it and said it wasn't even close to what I asked for, the guy had the audacity to say the way he cut it looked better than the picture I showed him. Would not recommend.
