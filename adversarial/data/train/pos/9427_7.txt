Seriously have been waiting for this place to finally open up. \nI went for one of the combos on the menu, the Matcha N Cream ( matcha ice cream with Oreos, Oreo crumbs, matcha powder and condensed milk). I got the regular size which was around $5.50. I admit, it's a bit pricey to have just two Oreos on top and the other toppings barely visible. Other than that, I enjoyed my ice cream very much. I feel like when you order something with matcha, you either feel like the flavor is too subtle or too strong. It was definitely a hit for me and the matcha flavor was just right. \n\nIt was a pretty cool experience to see them make the ice cream with all that nitrogen. \nThey also serve boba drinks which I'll definitely try the next time I go.
