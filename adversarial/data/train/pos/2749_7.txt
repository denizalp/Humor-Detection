Naughty, naughty Vegas.\n\nSo you dressed up like the ho you aren't, drank even yourself under the table at some swanky *exclusive* must-experience, perhaps swapped spit with randoms of both sexes like the rebel you aren't, and you're content thinking that OHHH THAT is what the *real* Vegas is all about!  Oh you are SO BAD!  Teehee!  \"What happens in Vegas stays in Vegas!\"\n\nSorry Richie Cunningham, but Drai's is not for you.\n\nThink less \"The Hangover\" and more \"Very Bad Things.\"  It's a basement basically.  Pretty sure it was a McDonalds way back in the day, followed by some sort of fancy shmancy?  Now it's dark, red-adorned hallways and shadowy corners that make you feel like you're Laura Palmer reincarnated.\n\nBlow through the long lines, pay that outstanding (in a bad way) cover charge, and revel in your fellow late-night hounds walking about and dancing on a remarkably shaped \"dance floor\" in one room and couch-sitting on another.  Drinks are expensive but strong (per the Vegas usual) when you can actually get one.\n\nDon't get me wrong, the experience here is definitely lacking the appropriate adjective base -- surreal, trippy, exquisite, sensual, extrasensory, whatever you wanna call it -- and it's definitely not for everyone.  I wish I could remember what the bathroom was like, but eh, too much of a good thing.  I do remember it was Spring Forward so even though Vegas clocks don't actually \"move\" until 5am (for shift changes), McCarran Airport still does at 2am and adjusts accordingly.  UGHHHHHHHHH\n\nAnywho, when I return it'll definitely be with my vacuuming crew:  Kate Moss, Mrs. Mia Wallace, Tony Montana, Bruno Mars, Carrot Top, where you at?  LOL
