I have lived here for about a year now. The management sucks and the people in the leasing office clearly have no idea what they are doing. The employees are rude and disrespectful to the tenants and they try to find ways to screw you out of more money. I have been working on moving out, and they are trying to charge me an extra 2 weeks of rent after I will be gone. They will screw you over, DO NOT MOVE IN HERE! \n\nIn total, they ripped me off about $700. That is almost a complete months rent gone for no reason. Completely unacceptable. Truly a terrible company to do business with. So glad to finally be done with all the bull crap.
