Ok, so obviously a priority when I moved to Pittsburgh was to find a nail salon stat! Immediately I was blown away with the prices of mani\/pedis here, typically around $10-$15 more expensive than in Los Angeles.  I digress. \n\nAnyways, after doing some preliminary YELP research, I discovered NY Nails, and decided to check it out.  I went on a Tuesday morning, probably around 10am, and the small salon was PACKED.  I could not believe how busy it was on a Tuesday morning...damn Gina.  The salon boasts the cheapest prices in the area, $30 for both mani\/pedi, and although it wasn't a high-end spa type of environment, and was very busy, it felt sanitary and clean.  \n\nI always bring my own nail polish, and my experience was pleasant.  I also asked a couple of women in the salon if this place was really \"the best.\" The basic consensus is that it is for the price, which is pretty darn cheap.  All and all I would rate this place a good value for a clean, nice experience. Don't expect the Ritz, but you get what you pay for. You dig?
