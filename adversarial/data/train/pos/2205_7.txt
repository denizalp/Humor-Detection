I've been dying to come here since the minute it opened. I literally want everything on the menu. I've never been to a place where there isn't a thing I wouldn't eat.\nMy waitress was awesome and super friendly, and there was the most handsome boy I have ever seen was expediting, so until my friend showed up, I stared directly at his butt.\nSo far, this is a terribly written review.\nAnyhoo-\nMy friend was late, so I ordered the beet salad. So delicious and perfectly balanced with the addition of goat cheese and orange.\nAll I could think of was the hot guys butt, NO I MEAN TEMPURA GREEN BEANS WITH PEPPER JELLY CREAM CHEESE DIPPING SAUCE. \nI would dip anything into that, it's so good.\nThen I had the butter burger. I've been wanting to try one since I saw it on a tv food show about Wisconsin and I thought, I may be fat but I'm not flying to Wisconsin for a cheeseburger, even if coated with butter.\n(I realize that I COULD have made one at home, but space travel has also been invented and I'm not doing that either.).\nHow was it you ask?\nDo you have to ask? \nIt was DELICIOUS.\nDUH.\nIt comes with tater tots. I almost bypassed them because I did fill up on vegetables, but they were the best tater tots I've ever had. Soooooo crispy on the outside and fluffy potato-y goodness on the inside.\n\nI WILL BE BACK.
