It was my first time trying peri-peri so I thought I'd do some quick research.  Peri Peri (or piri piri) is the portuguese name for the African Bird's Eye Chili (which on further inspection, looks nothing like a bird's eye...or a bird...or an eye...).  And consequently, Nando's is a chain hailing out of South African where Nando's Peri Peri Sauce is a local celebrity.\n\nThis particular Nando's was recommended to me by a friend.  I was expecting a Taco Bell type of establishment but was surprised at the set up.  The design is very user friendly and the staff is very polite and all smiles.  The operation works with you making an order, being provided a number and then finding a comfortable seat to await your order to be delivered to you.  A very balanced fusion of restaurant and fast food.\n\nThe menu itself seemed simple enough, focusing on chicken and level of spice you want.  Either you can have a pita or a chicken plate.  The sides range from spicy rice to fries to salad, the regular assortment found at most establishments.\n\nTo the chicken...I didn't try the pita but my friend raved about it and the portion size (filling).  I had the quarter chicken (breast) plate with fries and a salad.  The chicken looked weird from the start (see picture), like an overgrown but scrawny chicken had wandered into nando's looking for what the big fuss was about this bird's eye chili, only to end up on my plate.  \n\nHowever, the chicken was great.  I got hot and like to think that over the years of force feeding myself hot chicken wings, I could handle a little spice...but that chili is HOT!  I sucked back my tears and ate my chicken, which outside of the heat has a great taste.\n\nIf you aren't big on spicy food, they have milder versions and also have some pretty good side sauces that can be applied (pictures).  \n\nOverall, I'm a fan.  The concept is simple, the location clean and the staff is friendly.  I look forward to discovering the other locations in the west end...
