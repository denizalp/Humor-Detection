I'm not sure why everyone is complaining. I had a wonderful experience. I wasn't over charged at all. Some helpful tips stay away from 407 to avoid toll charges and if you are from the usa get your insurance company to mail you a Canadian insurance card before leaving it made the process so much faster and easier. Great place great group of guys and they pick you up and drop you off at the airport what more could you ask for!
