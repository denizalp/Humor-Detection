Michael Martin Murphy might have said \"it's a long way back to New Mexico\", but in Phoenix, you can take a short ride down Hayden from Old Town Scottsdale to Carlsbad Tavern for a great taste of New Mexico.\n\nthis place is really cool.  As you might be able to gather, the restaurant is \"named after\" the Carlsbad Caverns.  (Did you know that a Cave is technically not the same thing as a Cavern but that a Cavern is a cave?)  The ambiance\/decor of the restaurant is a cavern theme.  When you approach the building from the outside, it looks like you're approaching a \"cavern\".  When you walk inside, the restaurant looks like a cavern!  There is a moat with water outside that runs through the patio area. \n\nI've been to CT for large lunches and smaller casual dinners.  I love the patio outside for this!  Oh, on the cooler spring evenings, that patio is addicting and intoxicating.\n\nNow, for the food.  I have ordered several things from that menu.  I enjoy the Green Chile Stew.  It was the first thing I ordered when I went there, and I'm one of those weirdo creatures of habit, I\"ve probably ordered that 75% of the times I've been there.  I've ordered the Caverns Chicken Salad and I think it was Lobster Enchilladas more than once.  Their Sopas are very addictive.  You've been warned. \n\nwhat I like about their food is that every darn thing is so cheesy!  They put a lot of cheese their food.  If you're looking for HOT\/Heat, they can certainly spice up your life.  Their menu warns you about the spice level of certain food items.  I would say heed it, but you won't listen to me, now will you.  I tried that Habanero Burger and got half the pepper on the side... it was not that bad at all.  hehe...\n\nGive them a a try, you will like it.
