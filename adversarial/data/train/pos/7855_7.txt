We decided to go out for Xmas breakfast...\n It was busy, a lot of people were waiting for a table... They told us 20 minutes... \nThey gave us a table at a less time than that.\n\nThe service was timely and courteous,\nThe food was good, the coffee was great!\nThe overall experience was great, even though it was filled to capacity with more people waiting for tables!\n\nWe had a joyful Xmas breakfast!\nI am glad this IHOPE is in my neighborhood.\nWe will be back soon!
