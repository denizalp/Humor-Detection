The way I define my experience at Club Cayo Coco is to use the description, \"ODD\".  Great interior decor as experience thru-out the Entertainment District regions.  The Bar area on the first floor looked nice while the second floor made for better Meal consumption area.\n\nI've always thought enjoying Tapas is social and enjoyable but for reasons unknown it seemed to be less so here.  Maybe others will get better pleasure but my story here was opposite.\n\nThe Food were slightly disappointing as we ordered a few dishes to start.  That's when the notification of 2 items pp was given as we acknowledge the staff's words.  We weren't ready to order all at once as we wanted to take moments to converse as in Tapas culture, but the staff seemed over anxious at times for us or wanted to kept us aware.  It didn't work well as interruptions happen quite frequent until his objective was ending completion.  Nice staff but some rookie mistakes, thats all.\n\nThe Food just didn't excite as we began to narrow down to the one or two Tapas that we preferred and just got those again to accomplish the 2 item\/pp satisfaction of the establisment.  Spicy Potatoes($5.95), Stuffed Mushrooms(($6.95), Cod w\/Parsley Crust($8.95), Fried Oysters($12.00), Crab Cakes($9.95), etc...\n\nDesserts were also ODD because Churros were no longer offered at the earliest hours of the Saturday Evening.  I really wonder how many more customers they disappointed that night if they open til the early Morning hours.
