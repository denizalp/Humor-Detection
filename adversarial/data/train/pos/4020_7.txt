I love this hidden gift store on the Yonge Strip. We came by it after brunch and I love this small store full of goodies! You have things on the floor to ceiling book shelves full of unique gifts and jewelery. So many things to see! So many things you haven't seen before!\nI feels like an art gallery that you can touch. \n\nThe stuff in here is along the lines of Drysdale+Co, Blue Banana and other gift stores. Not as quirky and blunt as Rolo, a lot more softened with a quiet sophistication. \n\nIts my new go-to gift store!
