I recommended that my daughter-in-law take her car here to get detailed because it looked like a great place from the reviews and they had great rates and deals going on.\n\nFrom what she shared with me, upon entering everything seemed great. It was a long wait for the car, but that is normal with a detail. She got the full interior and wash for her car. After about 3 hours later when they told her the car was done was where everything went wrong. \n\nUpon entering, she noticed that her whole car horn had been stripped of paint. Now, when she confronted them about the issue, there was no \"I'm sorry\" or \"we will fix that\" It was a verbal attack by 4 different employees saying it was her fault for buying her car from a \"cheap dealership\" and they could not be held accountable. My daughter-in-law has had her car for 6 years and had it detailed many times before (inlcuding one time by myself), so if this was the case we think we would have noticed by now.\n\nAfter about 30 minutes of different employees coming up and telling her this was standard and our fault and they could not be held accountable, they informed her they would not give her money back, she finally got them to agree to repaint the car horn.\n\nA week later, she brought her car back to get it fixed and low and behold when she was told it was finished the paint was the wrong color. They did not mention this prior to doing the paint job, but after they simply said \"This is the closest you'll get.\" \n\nShe was so digusted and tired of dealing with ths issue, at this point it was not even worth the fight. Now she is $100 short, drove 25 minutes out of her way two weekends in a row to go to this place, and she has a car horn that does not match the rest of the car interior paint.\n\nIf you want have your car detailed to a sub-standard result, then go here, but if you like your car and don't want this kind of service or hassle, look elsewhere.
