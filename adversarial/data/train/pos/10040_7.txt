Picture a classy Italian restaurant with the Bellagio Fountain water show in the background and you've got one heck of an intimate dinner experience. \n\nI searched high and low for the top restaurants on the Strip and Scarpetta came to mind because of it's location and well known cuisine. With the dimly lit atmosphere and fine modern decor, I had a good hunch this would be the perfect place to share a late night dinner. \n\nWe came without a reservation but was immediately seated in the main dining area. The server immediately placed our menus and brought out our waters. He returned with a bread basket filled with a variety of freshly baked breads and a side of olive oil, eggplant tapenade, and cheese. Each bite was intoxicating and we had to forcibly stop to avoid getting too full. \n\nI dared to be adventurous and ordered a Billionaire $16 (homage to homie Bobby Axelrod from \"Billions\") and thoroughly enjoyed this bourbon based cocktail with a touch of pomegranate and absinthe. This is worth coming back to at least sip at the bar to pregame or as a nightcap. My guest ordered an Eagle Rare 10 Year ($18) in addition to our meal. \n\nWe love to share our dishes and decided to exclusively order two seafood plates:\n\n- Mediterranean Octopus ($21) olive oil poached potato, tonatto sauce & salsa verde\n- Fennel Dusted Black Cod ($35) asparagus, hedgehog mushroom \n\nThe grilled single tentacle of the octopus was cooked perfectly without the excess chew or toughness. The lightly seasoned potatoes matched well with the texture of the octopus. This is a must order for any seafood fans. We scrambled to see who would get the last bite and I bet you can imagine who got it. \n\nThe server was kind enough to split our black cod order for each of us to enjoy. The acidity of the tomatoes worked nicely to cut the velvety richness of the cod. With a mix of the mushrooms and sauce, the dish became ordinary to extraordinary. \n\nDessert was left to another venue but would like another opportunity to make room on a future visit. \n\nOur server took care of us from start to finish. At the end, we felt slightly rushed because we were one of the last diners but overall, felt acknowledged throughout our meal. \n\nIf you're looking for an upscale meal with finesse, attentive service and a gorgeous view, consider making an OpenTable reservation here. Every bite and moment from the dinner was memorable. For now, my restaurant experience at The Cosmopolitan (STK, Rose Rabbit Lie and now Scarpetta) have been very positive and I can not wait to try the rest of their eateries.
