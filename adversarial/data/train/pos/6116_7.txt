If I were just reviewing the food, I would give more stars, but since I couldn't separate the food from the whole experience, I have to give Fran's a \"medium.\"   \n\nI walked into Fran's, which is cute enough, and was immediately overwhelmed by the smell of ginger. SO WEIRD!  I spent the rest of my time there (and truthfully much of the rest of the day) wondering what the heck made the place smell so strange. Was it a candle? If so, \"Bad Fran! No smelly candles near food!\"   Was it something in the kitchen (what sandwiches have ginger in them?)? Perhaps they  were brewing up a big pot of ginger tea somewhere (Which is totally disgusting).  \n\nMy sandwich was good (included what looked like home-made bacon!), and the potato salad was very good.  It was refreshing to experience a mayo-based potato salad that actually had flavor and wasn't overly mayo'd. \n\nI may go back.  And hopefully I won't leave with that ginger smell in my hair again. \n\nPS I hate ginger!
