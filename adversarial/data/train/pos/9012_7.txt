So after my original barber moved out of town, I hopped around from barbershop to barbershop looking for someone whose good with scissors as they are with clippers.  Finally, I found someone at In Da Cut. First time I went, I have to admit, I was nervous and a bit confused. It was pretty busy, there was no sign up sheet, and I was barely greeted with a stare-down and a \"sup\", if you call that a greeting. I told the guy in the first chair that I didn't have an appointment. He said \"alright, it'll be about an hour\".  Two hours later I finally get seated and the barber did a bomb job that I went back a second time... This time I tried setting up an appointment so I wouldn't have to wait so long, but he said just come in before 6. I showed up an hour before, ended up waiting 2 hours, yet again. 3rd times a charm right?... I decide to show up mid afternoon on a Friday. One person was waiting, and about 8 chairs full. My guy was in the middle of the cut so I made sure he saw me so I can jump in right after.  30mins later I get seated and get my cut. This time not only did he give me a good cut, figuratively, he also cut me literally with a straight razor no less.  Instead of getting compliments I get, \"what happened to your face.\" and, \"did you get your @ss kicked by a cat?\" Getting a haircut there is expensive not including tips, but you expect really good service for what you pay for, right? Wrong.  He didn't apologize, or even cared to return my money or even give me a discount. I honestly feel taken advantage of.  Vegas has a reputation of having poor costumer service and this just adds to that reputation. Those are some talented ppl, but what they have in talent, they lack in hospitality.  I'll give it one more shot, but this time with a different barber. If the experience is the same 2 stars will become one and my search will continue.
