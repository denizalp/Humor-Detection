Calling all members of the Jedi alliance, the rebellion needs your help! \n\nI am so bad at first person shooter games. I was literally sick to my stomach nervous going into the mission because I was certain that I was going to blow the mission & make my team fail. The guy that suited us up asked my husband if he could see me and his reply was: \"Yea but she's a little short to be a storm trooper.\" Ha!! As the door to the first space shuttle opened, I entered the weapon room shaking. My partner handed me a blaster & the first thing I did was accidentally fire it at the wall & blew our cover. I told you I was bad, right?\n\nFortunately you have unlimited ammo, so we were able to fight our way out & get to safety. We completed the mission without dying and I left with a huge smile. I would love to do it again, without so much adrenaline pumping.  Now that I know what it is like, I think I could do much better. \n\nThe whole adventure was thrilling and fun. My only ding is that it felt really short for the price tag but hey, yolo.
