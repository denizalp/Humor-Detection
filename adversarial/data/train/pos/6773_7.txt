OH MY GOD! After trying sushisamba yesterday, and then dining here... Soo much better! and it's just downstairs inside SouthPoint hotel. The service was quick, food came out fast, and we satisfied by the end of the meal. \n\nThe chili garlic edamame is the best I've ever tried!!! I could seriously eat two bowl of it in one sitting. (I've already dined here twice and gotten it every time hehe) \n\nThe dynamite green mussel is so bomb! Very cheesy though, but nonetheless so good. The salmon poke (also on the HH menu) was good! Also on the HH menu was fried oysters!! So cheap and good! I also tried the 777 & Spicy Mexican roll. 777 was delicious, spicy Mexican was okay! Kinda plain. The YT sashimi was very fresh! I enjoyed all the sushi I ate here. And let me tell you, I am a picky sushi critic. \n\nThe tonkotsu ramen with pork belly was okay! Nothing toooo special. \n\nIf I lived in Vegas, I'd drive here just to eat this place :)
