We enjoy visiting the Santa Fe from time to time.  It's near our neighborhood so it's convenient for us when we want a night out.  Here's a highlight of some of our favorite places:\n\n- The Charcoal Room.  It's their high end dining option.  It's not really \"high end\", but it's their most expensive restaurant.  The food is very good and is not nearly as expensive as Strip high-end dining.\n\n- Cabo Mexican Restaurant.  Decent Mexican food.  Their Nachos are really good....the rest of the dishes are ok.\n\n- 4949 Lounge.  Love this lounge....it's in the middle of the casino.  Friendly bartenders and waitresses.  Great place to hangout with friends or have a business meeting.\n\nThe property is always clean and there's plenty of parking.....two big deals for me.  Overall, it's a fun locals casino....definitely worth checking out.\n\nReturn Factor - 80%
