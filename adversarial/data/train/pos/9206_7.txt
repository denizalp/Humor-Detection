Wow! Dumplings I'm a sucker for anything doughy stuffed with meat! First impression when walking into the place 1- it was at capacity 2- me and my girl where the only colored couple in there (usually the case) haha... However, although it was busy we were seated rather quickly... When we received the menu we were sort of confused only because we couldn't  understand the order sheet since it was all in Chinese :-| but after further investigation I deciphered the menu and realized you just match the number from the menu to the order sheet. Service was good no complaints, food was delivered fast and hot, still want to try the steam pork buns if they have them after all they are my favourite! The price wasn't to bad either.. So all in all a good experience and I will definitely be back..
