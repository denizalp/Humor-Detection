Where do I start! The baked goods were deciduous but the food is only so so. When I sent my burger back the owner, Amy came out and asked me why I didn't like it. I explained it was over cooked (I ordered MR) and she told me that was not what I ordered and she was not going to remake another burger for me. I was with my daughter who is only 2 yrs old and was nervous and scared to say the least by Amy's attitude. If you are going to Amy's Baking Comany PLEASE DONT take children. The owners are very unpredictable and will verbally asult  you for the littlest thing. I will never go back even if the baked goods were tasty.
