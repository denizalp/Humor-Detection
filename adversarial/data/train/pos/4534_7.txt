Was here at 730am on a Saturday and already there were lines and people hanging out on the patio. Seems like a spot for locals - lots of chatting between the servers and people. Really friendly environment that makes me want to be a morning person, jog here every weekend morning, and get a nice and comforting cortado or latte to sip and relax.\n\nToo bad I'm lazy. Guess I'll just drip my maxwell house at 11am on a Saturday instead. (But really great coffeeshop).
