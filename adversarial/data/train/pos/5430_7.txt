I have to say that when I lived at a CPM managed property, that I had never been more uncomfortable, cold, or insecure.   I lived in a 4 bedroom apartment on E. Stoughton.  Needless to say, many of the windows were not sealed, which meant cold winter nights and warm summer nights regardless of whether the heat or a\/c was on.  \n\nFurthermore and probably most important, near the end of the year I had been living there, my roommates and I had the pleasant surprise of a RACCOON in our living room (Let me also state that we were on the 4th floor).   This raccoon decided to live with us in our living room and throughout the ventilation system of the apartment for a good week.  The manner in which CPM got rid of the raccoon was by placing a brick over a hole in a closet where the raccoon entered the apartment.  This didn't keep the raccoon from running around the apartment ventilation system for a few days and probably dying...although we didn't encounter any terrible odors.  However, I do not see this as being the correct manner in taking care of an animal problem  \n\nI do not recommend anyone live with CPM as hundreds of problems have been reported to the university tenant union regarding their poor property management abilities.
