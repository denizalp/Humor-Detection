If I wanted something this rude, tacky, and expensive I'd spend Christmas with my dad's ex-wife.\nWaited through a rather short, but painfully slow line during off-hours on a weekday.  When I got to the front, an irritable, unhelpful woman rejected my discount card, but couldn't be bothered to articulate why.  She tried to sell me 2 tickets for $120 with no explanation of drinks, obscene pleasures, or anything else to explain the exorbitance.  Ahead of me, I could see yet more inexplicably slow lines.  (It's a buffet, not a rock concert!) So I left.\n\nFYI, no buffet with stupidly long lines can be considered fine dining under any circumstances and no endangered shellfish on ice or oversized plaster busts could make these people worth tolerating.
