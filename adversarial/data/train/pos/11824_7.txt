So I decided to try the new sandwich shop in town but it turns out the place is a mess.  My fiance and i got in at 1230 and there was barely anyone there.  We ordered two sandwiches, one chicken and one ham.  We sat waiting for 30, I repeat 30 minutes.  Usually sandwiches are known for being quick!  After the wait we only get one sandwhich.  I go up to the desk and ask for what the deal is and the employee tells me I only ordered one sandwhich with both ham and chicken.  I said I didn't.  His coworker then said no the tickets were on top of each other.  I sit back down for another 5 minutes and they say they are out of ham....  the sandwiches were good but I was in such a rush at that point I couldn't enjoy it.  I doubt I will ever try them again unless I can find two hours to spare for a meal.
