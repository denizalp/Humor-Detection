Bad food. UGH! At least I had really low expectations, so I wasn't really surprised when the food hit the table.\n\nMy dad was in town. Being from Brantford (hometown of the Great One) he just had to check out Wayne Gretzky's.\n\nOverall:\n\nStaff\/service - 3.5 star - friendly, helpful polite waiter. Food took a bit longer than necessary to come out but nothing outrageous.\n\nDecor - 3.5-4 star. More upscale than you would imagine, it's nicer than a mere sports bar. Absolutely massive interior.\n\nRooftop patio - 5 star, hello, it's beautiful! \n\nFood - 1-2 star. Yuck. Do NOT have the pizzas. They used a pre-made frozen crust of some sort. It was like cardboard. Thick too. Totally gross. We tried the South-Western pizza and they actually squirted some sort of cheese whiz looking crap all over the top. Disgusting. The crab cakes were kind of decent, but they ruined them by placing them on some kind of disgusting huge pile of mayo\/tartar sauce and I had to scrape it off with a spoon. Overall, no love whatsoever put into the food and it was too expensive considering nothing was made from scratch.\n\nBut yeah....the rooftop patio is worth a trip. Eat somewhere else.
