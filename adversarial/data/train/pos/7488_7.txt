There's plenty to like at this diner out of Florida. My favorite thing to date has been their fried chicken and waffles. The texture of the waffle was great -- light and crispy, just like I like it and the chicken was so tender and juicy thanks to them brining the bird over night. The crust is nice and thick and well seasoned. It's a huge portion with half a bird, so plan on sharing.\n\nThe crab cake benedict was really good, too. Lots of crab meat with a modest amount of filler, fried and topped with eggs with a side of home fries. Also popular is their Charleston shrimp and grits. They take the grits and form them into blocks that are fried, then covered in gravy and shrimp. It's mighty tasty with just enough spice to let your taste buds know they're there. It's filled with plenty of shrimp and overall a huge portion size.\n\nOn the sweeter side, they have different types of stuffed French toasts. The \"Apple yo halla\" was available on our first visit. It was like a cheesecake sandwiched between challah French toast topped with fried apples.\n\nWith a second location recently opened and ambitious plans to greatly expand their empire, I can only hope that they can maintain the high quality food at each spot.
