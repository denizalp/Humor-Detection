I always take a new friend here to introduce the owner, Remzi. And I've been here countless times and enjoyed his amazing customer service that we are now friends. It's a great character and is down to play a game of Uno any time I come through. The lychee rose drink is amazing. They have many pastries and ice cream flavors to choose from. He makes a custom face every time I'm here! The interior is very nice and inviting. I go here often with a new friend to try and visit Remzi
