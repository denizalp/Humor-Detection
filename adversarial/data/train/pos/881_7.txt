Food was great - ordered The Long Trail (roast beef was EXCELLENT).  Quick service, everybody seemed friendly.\n\nI wasn't so much into the atmosphere - forgive me, but I went to school in Flagstaff in the late 1990s, and I'm not crazy about hippies...  but what was I expecting from a place called the Vermont Sandwich Company?  ;)
