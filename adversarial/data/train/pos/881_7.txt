Gourmet food junkie.  That's why I'm obsessed with homegoods.  Even though I'm not a snacker, if it says olive oil, chia, flax, dates, pretzel perfection, ancient grains, garbanzo, porcini, truffle something or other, I'm a goner.  The more obscure the food, usually the tastier & better & even possibly healthier for you. Not that I've done a double blind scientific study yet but with the interesting eating finds here, I feel pretty good.  If you didn't know homegoods had foodstuffs, check it out.  Here is where I found out about real olive oil, so tasty here, but the supermarket stuff is bland and fake.  That's another review in itself....
