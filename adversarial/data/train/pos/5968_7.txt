I've always wondered about the large, pretty white building right off of South & East boulevards. And then  I heard about a Tidbits launch party launching at Alexander Scott...a new interiors and home furnishings biz housed in that very building! \n\nFirst of all, it's huge. It's a very large building. And there is so much merchandise gracing every room. It's nicely laid out, if a bit crowded, with custom furniture, ready made pieces, candles, bedding, jewelry, cards, paintings, and beautiful home goods. I even spied some vintage chandeliers and suitcases in the mix! \n\nThere are two levels to explore so be ready to spend a bit of time in the store searching through all the treasures. While I really enjoyed the beautiful furniture and fabrics, there were a few extra bright spots worth mentioning: \n\n-Alexander Scott has a great selection of jewelry. Very impressive and uber affordable. This was a shocker to me. Pretty cuffs from $25-$50, necklaces from $40-$100, etc. All sorts of styles, materials and tastes. \n\n-There's a fantastic collection of handmade greeting cards (on both levels). Many of these items are crafted by local and regional artists. My favorite? A card that simple read, \"You are the Milli to my Vanilli. Girl you know it's true.\" Hell to the yeah. \n\n-The staff were welcoming and very sweet. No uppity attitudes here. \n\nIf you're shopping along East Blvd., Alexander Scott is a fantastic stop...for your home, yourself or to snag a gift!
