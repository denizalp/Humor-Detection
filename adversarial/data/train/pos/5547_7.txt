Felt like having schnitzel (yeah it happens) and in my searches this place kept coming up. So with an umbrella in tow I walked by this spot on a rainy day in January (it can happen). \nThe place is miniscule and has only 4 seats, there is hardly any place to walk around. The menu is hand written on a white board with a paper version on the counter.\nI decided to go with the sandwich and just to confirm I asked whether the schnitzel was veal, lo and behold I was told that they only have the chicken and pork version. Blasphemy if you ask me how can any self respecting authentic schnitzel place not have veal! After a bit of probing I was told that veal is more expensive and hardly any people order it. Oh the self proclaimed politically correct have struck again and have deprived the people of an authentic dish.\nNever mind I ordered my chicken schnitzel sandwich to stay. I was asked whether I wanted sweet chili sauce on the sandwich as well. Puzzling IMO as its not authentic to say the least.  I waited patiently for my food and my apprehensions were washed away when I saw the sandwich. Very traditional serving, the chicken pounded  thin and fried nicely served on lettuce sauce and tons of tomato. The meat was cooked perfectly, right amount of crisp. A sandwich that will put any of the chain places to shame for sure.\nNow only if they had the veal version I would come back for more.\nGood stuff.
