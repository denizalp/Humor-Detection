I was underwhelmed and unimpressed. We came here because of a college basketball game and their happy hour specials. The beer offerings are meh. The wings were not good at all - not good quality meat, non-spicy sauce, not saucy enough, and not good dipping sauce. Nothing else we tried was worth writing home about either. And the service was incredibly slow and scattered.\n\nBut the ambiance and vibe are nice. It's a bit divey. It's homey. It's welcoming. It's got cool, local people.
