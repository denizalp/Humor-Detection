This place is a parody of itself. It's almost as if the whole idea behind Lady Jane's was based on a wild dream of a pubescent 16-year-old boy. Needless to say, I had to see what the hype was about....\n\nPerhaps you've heard the outrageously cheesy radio commercials advertising \"wicked awesome\" haircuts for $10? Well, being that the latest location was situated right down the street from me and with the bad economy and all, I thought I'd see what was so \"wickedly awesome\" about it.\n\nAs you walk-in, you come to a computer monitor where you browse screen shots of the stylists to chose from. That's right, you pick based on looks as to who earns the right to work on your dome. The busty blonde was my pick. (The naughty looking red with stiletto's was my second choice). \n\nIn the wait area, there's black leather recliners and plasma TV's to keep you entertained. If that doesn't do it for you, feel free to challenge one of the hambone patrons to a game of foosball. If you're more of the well read type, browse back-issues of Sports Illustrated. The atmosphere was hardly conducive to reading with all the distractions though, including Nickelback and other generic rock blaring from the overhead speakers. \n\nWhen your scantily dressed stylist is ready for you, she calls you back to her station. Each station has it's very own plasma TV. I wasn't looking to be hypnotized by the boob-tube though, only the boobs.
