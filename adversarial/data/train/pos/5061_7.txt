Korean and Japanese hair stylists run this tiny upstairs salon. This is the place to go to cut Asian hair. I've been here twice and they've always managed to tame my thick tresses into something that suits my face shape and style. I've had my hair done twice by the owner (whose name is also Sandy!). She did a lovely job of cutting and colouring my hair. Kaori also did a decent job of giving me a layered shorter style recently. Their English is good enough to communicate with me what I'm looking for, but mostly I just sit back and let them do their thing and hope everything comes out right. And it does.. eventually. \n\nThe only minor complaints I have about this place are\n1. the noob young male hair colourist who accidentally bleached my whole head of hair orange last year. Sandy fixed it and offered me 50% off my next visit, which I stupidly declined and am now still trying to grow out the supremely damaged orangey ends that show up every time my hair dye fades. \n2. ventilation in here is not so great, super stuffy with chemical fumes during the summer. And there's always a horde of people waiting to get their hair done, so make an appointment! Or go early during a weekday. They'll offer you a box of juice while you're flipping through Asian hairstyle magazines deciding on which SNSD girl's hair you want.
