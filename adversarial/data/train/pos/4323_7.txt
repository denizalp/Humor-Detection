Years have passed and I have been going to this gym ever since my last review. I must say they have improved a lot! the staff is way nicer then before. The cardio machines are still crap because majority of them are broken, specially the elliptical machines.. I've been taking a a lot of the group classes and the instructors are amazing! Let's just say my one star became a four star because of these instructors. I highly recommend doing the Zumba, Body Pump, Cx and Hot hula classes.. those are all great for cardio and the instructors know what they are going. as for the men's bathroom they need to fumigate that it stinks like TUNA CRAP! Can't complain though for 20$ a month..
