I love the intimate setting. Service was great. Prices are fair. \n\nMy boyfriend and I usually order different entrees so we could steal bites from each other's plates, but we both thought the chicken tequila fettuccine sounded good. \nAnd it was! It's a spinach fettuccine with bell peppers, onions and tequila-lime cream sauce. Maybe the cream was a tad bit too rich for us, but it was delectable nonetheless.\n\nLooking at the pics, I'm bummed out we didn't find room in our tummies for dessert! The messy Sundae and the mini donuts look so good! I can't wait to go back for those!
