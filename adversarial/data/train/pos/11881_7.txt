Dr. Karen Ngo rocks!  I injured my lower back by accidentally going to full extension on leg press (ouch!).  Karen saw me a few days later, on a Sunday, as the back was still painfully stiff and sore.  She spent an hour on the assessment and then amazing acupuncture with electric current, adjustments, and facial stretching.  At the end of the session, my back felt great, the stiffness was gone!  As a competitive bodybuilder, this was very good news as I could get back to the gym a lot sooner!
