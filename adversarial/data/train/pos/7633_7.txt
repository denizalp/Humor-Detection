I don't watch Triple D. I barely know anything about Guy Fieri other than the fact that he looks like a pro-wrestling 2000's raver. That being said, Pinky's just seems like the type of place that he would go to flavortown at. It's cheap, gimmicky, and an extremely popular place to dine whether you're a tourist or a local. \n\nThere's a bunch of fun menu items like Crab Puppies and Corn Dog Shrimp while the White Trash burger and the Toney Baloney are a pretty accurate representation of what the sandwich menu looks like. I had the Kickin' Chicken tacos and they were definitely pretty tasty although they were on of the more boring things I could have ordered. \n\nThey do something here called Ding Dong Style which is the combination of crunchy peanut butter, honey-cilantro slaw, and hot sriracha sauce to top a burger or tacos. It wasn't exactly my thing, but I gotta applaud a place that's willing to take a chance on an unlikely combo. \n\nConsidering the dirt cheap price tag and the entertaining environment I'd definitely give Pinky's another go if I'm in this part of Charlotte.
