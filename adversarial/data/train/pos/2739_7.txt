My Yorkville to-do list goes something like this:\n- Get an expensive haircut\n- Buy a grossly overpriced party dress that you will wear maybe once\n- Play spot the pretentious hottie or not-so-hottie\n- Eat some tasty sushi at Asuka\n\nThis cozy little restaurant is one of my new neighborhood favorites.\nReasonably priced.\nWe ordered the Love Boat (sushi and sashimi)  and soft shell crab rolls.\nEverything was fresh and yummy.\nServer was friendly, you just have to remember to use the call button.\nI like the seating in the little private booths.\nI'll have to go back and try some other rolls.
