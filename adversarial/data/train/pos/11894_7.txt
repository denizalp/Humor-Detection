I am a Sonoran Dog  fanatic.  Fa-na-tic! Have dog,  will travel.   My husband and I drove 20 miles to five this place because it was a Sonoran dog kind of day.  We had to travel to this location from the 32nd street location because it was really dirty with chicken laing on the ground in the parking lot.  Eww.\n\nWe ordered a traditional Sonoran, a Sinoloa and papas. Let's start with the good.  The papas were mashed potatoes with butter, sour cream,  queso cotija, and asada. Holy S*** was it delicious! \n\nThe Sinoloa was a sonoran dog with cheese and Lays cheddar cheese on top of it all.  There was too much stuff on top, throwing the bun, dog and topping ratio off balance.  The same could be said of the other dog. Too many tomatoes threw the taste off.  I took at least half a cup of them off of the top. \n\nI walked out of the store sad, and regretting passing my favorite dog stand for this place.  Oh well,  you live and you learn.
