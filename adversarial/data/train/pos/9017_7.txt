I love this place for so many reasons. \n\nFirstly, the store itself. It is so roomy, well lit, and clean. There are plenty of tables and comfortable chairs - ones with cushion, instead of the metal folding chairs so often used in game stores. The ceilings are high and everything is spread out so well that it doesn't feel cramped. \n\nThey have probably the biggest collection of Magic cards that I have seen in a local store. Great variety, and very good prices. The players are nice as well, always willing to help out those who are less experienced. It's a very friendly atmosphere.\n\nThe owners are awesome. We brought in a board game and one of the guys sat down to learn it, then he ordered a copy to stock in the store. When we needed a shade of paint that they didn't have, the owners special ordered it for us. \n\nI'm so glad to finally have a gaming store on this side of town.
