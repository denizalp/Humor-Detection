I found Dynamic Dental thru my Culinary insurance provider list and I carefully researched the names on the list and narrowed it down to 5 dentist.  Then I compared them from 5 other practices thru Yelp and I don't regret choosing dynamic dental.  They've been professional, courteous and very kind from beginning to the end.  I brought my kids individually because I was asking to be seen last-minute prior to school starting and they accommodated me to the best they can and each time I came in it has been nothing but pleasant smiles.  Thanks for the warm welcome from India and Dr. Kim for being gentle with my kids and coming out to speak to me regarding my concerns about my sons 2 front teeth that hasn't come out at age 9.  I would have known what's going on but I chose not to be present while Dr. Kim was examining my kids because they tend to be brave when \"mommy\" is not around. He was very busy at that time but managed to keep me updated. Penelope thanks for a fantastic cleaning and I love your stories.  Lastly, Dr. Kim doesn't just do your exams he has no problem cleaning your teeth if hygienist is not available or busy. KUDOS TO Dynamic Dental for a GREAT CUSTOMER Care!!!
