I love this airport! It feels like home to me. Charlotte is like a safe haven since I use it as a hub to fly in and out of Roanoke, it means the last leg before I get to see my family, or the last bit of southern comfort I'll have before returning to Los Angeles. It's familiar, and has that good old Southern feel to it. (Please don't mistake this with trashy redneck). What I mean is that most all employee's will give you a nod and a comforting smile, and be more than willing to take time to help you find your way. These encounters most often times (for me at least) turn into a few minutes of friendly chit-chat while I'm on my way from one terminal to another. Also, spread throughout the airport are \"rest\" areas that have these comfortable, huge front porch sized, white rocking chairs that are very well maintained. (What other airport will you find that in??)\n\nCLT also has a very specific smell throughout the entire building. It's like a fresh, clean scent almost. The carpet is consistently clean and the hard surface floors always polished and scratch-free. The windows at the gates are sans handprints and the trash cans are always recently changed. It's very rare that I have any issues arriving or departing from Charlotte. Also, it is easily one of the most simple International Airports to navigate. This place couldn't get anymore organized!
