OMG I love this place. 24 hours of savings is right! I was so glad to find this place is not too far from our house. This is my regular grocery spot. Forget Smiths, that place is way overpriced!\n\nWinCo has a huge produce section, bulk foods (big time savings there!), huge meat department, decent seafood department, huge bakery, everything about this place is huge!\n\nSome of my usual buys are 18 count eggs for around $2, greek yogurt for $3, cottage cheese for $2, tomatoes $0.79\/lb, avocados $0.74 each, mangos $0.69 each.\n\nOnly reason why I'm knocking down one star is bc if I need stuff for pretty much any type of ethnic food, the selections are pretty sparse here.\n\nThis chain is employee owned, and they don't take credit cards, but they do take debit. Also you have to bag your own stuff, but I can score some extra bags that way.
