Excellent addition to the north Scottsdale restaurant options. The food was great. We got the charcuterie, French Dip, salmon, and the kale salad. Each dish was excellent.\n\nCody was our server, and was one of the most fun servers we have ever had. We will definitely be returning, and bringing others along with us. A++
