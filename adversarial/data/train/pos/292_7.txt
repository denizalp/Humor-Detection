Drove nine and a half hours from San Francisco to come here. Reddit said it was a life-changing experience. The biggest understatement there could be. My phone battery was on 5%, my hotel miles away and stuck in a town I had no clue where to go from. My worries vanished as I took the first sip of my espresso. These guys are changing the game here on Fremont St., and doing something that makes me really, really happy. Also, I think it's safe to say the Bay can no longer claim to know their coffee. Or at the very least, I can no longer claim to know what truly good coffee is. Still in shock.
