WOW....Talk about an IMPROVEMENT!!!  I stayed at the Tropicana last January and I tell you that you could of not paid me to stay in this hotel again.  The rooms were disgusting, and the Casino smelt like a combination of mold, old people, and baby vomit.  \n\nUpon checking in at the \"New Tropicana\" I was simply amazed.  The staff was incredibly helpful but more note worthy than that was the fact that the whole resort has been renovated!  The casino was completely remodeled, with white tile marble everywhere.  They added new restaurants, the pool has been renovated, and they are opening a brand new night club on May 26th, 2011.  I cannot tell you how impressed I was with this place.  The crowd has also changed, a much more younger, lively bunch and not the usual old locals hanging out in this \"used to be\" dive.\n\nThe rates are also UNBEATABLE.  This hotel compares to the Luxor and Mandalay Bay with rates about half of theirs.  If you are coming to Vegas I would highly recommend staying here!\n\nTip: The Filet Wrap available at Cafe Nikki is phenomenal!
