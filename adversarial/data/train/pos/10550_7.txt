Before I begin I would implore any establishment not to betray a fundamental rule of basic hygiene . A sign of respect for your customers is to ensure that the silverware is wiped and clean. The second is to honestly convey the product as described in the menu or place a requisite photo of the product. \n\nSpoons in coffee: if we are going to be bold and place a spoon in the small coffee cup, please avoid placing a spoon that is filthy and crusted with food. Some people do not place sugar in the coffee, just serve the coffee on a small dish. In my years, I have never beenade more I'll than the sight of a crusted spoon, filthy in a cup of coffee. Why, o Lord why can an establishment not respect it's customers than not to wipe a spoo.\n\nOmelette. Ok, a smoked salmon omelette sounds interesting, but what I saw was an omelette with slices of salmon lazily placed in the omeltte, not within. Basically a plain omeltte with salty salmon and aged provolone for a salt bomb. Not to mention undergone potatoes and a broken hollandaise sauce on the Benny. \n\nPrices do not appear to reflect the quality of foodstuffs or service from the lovely family whom operate the restaurant. For $50.00 for three for breakfast, please note that a soiled spoon and a basic home fry are not the way to attract repeat customers.\n\nI
