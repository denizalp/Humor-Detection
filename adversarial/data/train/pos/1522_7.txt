The Meh, I've experienced better definitely sums up this place. But, what would you expect for this part of town. It was surprisingly packed...with elderly people. This place is super smoky, and really seedy. Lol, North Las Vegas at its finest. I did a little gambling, about $5 worth on Caveman Keno, while waiting to be seated for lunch at the coffee shop. Guess what?! I didn't win anything :(
