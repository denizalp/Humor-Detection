Completely disorganized store. Witnessed the owner yelling at her employees in front of me. No customer service or answers to my questions. Very low quality products and a lot of damaged product on the floor that looked like they had just fell of the back of the truck. I left as quickly as I could, would never recommend buying anything here.
