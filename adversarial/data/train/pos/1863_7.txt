I've never had such poor customer service in my life. The bartender's attitude is beyond rude. It's a nice bar and I've been going since they opened, now I won't be returning. The prices are fair and it's a good environment, but this guy was giving an attitude The second I walked in. Won't be returning anytime soon.
