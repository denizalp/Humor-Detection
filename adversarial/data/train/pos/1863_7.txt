Get the Benicio Del Porko, that is all.  We pass this place all the time and finally had a chance to actually dine here after a morning hike.  I know there are other items on the menu, but I was so blown away by this dish that I'd come back just for it.  This item lives up to its stellar namesake with its BBQ pulled pork, hollandaise sauce, charred corn, cilantro, over easy eggs atop grilled cornbread.  Who thought of this wonderful creation?!  Give them an award STAT, whichever the Academy Award there is for food that blows you away!  Just yum.  The end.
