I love this place! It's always my first place that comes to mind for Korean BBQ. Very large AYCE selection for a fair price. Jan is always a wonderful waitress! She's so hardworking and attentive, not to mention funny! $20\/dinner, $15\/lunch. Atmosphere is clean and modern. Doesn't get much better than this!
