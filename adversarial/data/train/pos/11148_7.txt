Yaas Fukuburger, yAaaaAaas!\n\nI originally knew about Fukuburger back when its location in Hollywood was still around. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to give it a try in California because it closed down.\n\nFlash forward to a couple of years later, in preparation for a quick trip to Vegas. I stumbled upon Fukuburger's locations after a quick food search on Yelp.\n\nWe decided to go to the location in the Hawaiian Plaza, conveniently located near MGM Grand on the strip.\n\nI decided to order the Tamago burger with a side of jazz fries. Even though we ate here for dinner, it is easy to imagine just how popular Fukuburger is as a late-night joint.\n\nThe Tamago burger is stacked with crispy fried onions, plenty of delicious sauce, a perfect ooey gooey fried egg and a hearty beef patty. Soooo good. The jazz fries were also crisp and SO tasty with the combination of gravy and \"crack\" sauce.\n\nIt's a must-have when you're in Vegas. Crazy good.
