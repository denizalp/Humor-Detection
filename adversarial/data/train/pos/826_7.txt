Super hip restaurant across the street from Fashion Square. Plenty of underground parking.\n\nI came here on a Friday evening for dinner with friends, and we had a great time. The atmosphere is hip and they even had a live band! The food was indulgent and delicious. I'd highly recommend the Fried Chicken.\n\nOverall, CD is a great place for dates and groups of friends. I'd definitely return!
