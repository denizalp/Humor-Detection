Stay here if you like:\n\n* Homogenized, cookie cutter people.\n* Fake body parts:  Chins, breasts, hair\n* Reruns of MTVs The Grind.\n* SPRING BREAK, WHOO!\n* Frat parties.\n* Paying too much just so you could say you've been there.\n* Nice enough rooms, but, again, far too expensive.\n* Roofies.  Ecstacy.  GBH.  Other horrible mind altering substances.\n* Lack of conversation.\n* Groping and\/or being groped.\n* Top 40 music.\n* Camera crews shooting for made-for-cable shows and gettin' all in your way.\n\nI kinda have a lot of disdain for this place, the type of people who flock here, and the amount of money they charge to be surrounded by these people.  The theatres are OK as is the margarita brunch.  The rest of it could fall off the world and I wouldn't care.
