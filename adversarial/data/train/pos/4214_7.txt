I came for lunch after reading the reviews on Yelp. It's a Tuesday, and I arrived just before noon. The restaurant it self is large and airy, with televisions on the wall. It looks like the restaurant itself isn't quite finished, the stair case leading to the upper level still had grinder marks left where the welds are.\nThat being said, it's still a nice space.\nOur waitress\/hostess (Ai) was very friendly, and the food came out in a timely fashion. My uncle and I ordered the miso ramen. It was tasty and came with a couple of pieces of pork. Other ingredients in the soup were, cabbage, mini bok choy, corn, half of a  hard boiled egg, and the obvious.\nI can't comment on the other menu items, as I only had the Miso soup. Oh I almost forgot , I did have the dragon roll. The roll itself was very fresh, but my only complaint would be the size of the roll itself. Although the roll itself was relatively cheap, the roll was on the small side.\nHowever that doesn't deter me from coming back. \nI'll be back with the rest of the family to try the food again in the near future.\nOn another note, Ai the hostess was very nice to talk with.:-)
