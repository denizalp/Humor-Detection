Hashi is the newest ramen house to enter the Vegas game for the best noods! They stand out by having a lighter, chicken-based broth that keeps this classic dish from feeling quite so heavy and filling. The house special shio was a good lunch choice with added egg and nori. They offer a black garlic oil add-on that sounds amazing ($1). However, they only have thin noodles and I prefer a thicker cut. Also, their chashu is inconsistent, containing more fat than edible protein and not being as tender as elsewhere. Fast and friendly but not my first pick.
