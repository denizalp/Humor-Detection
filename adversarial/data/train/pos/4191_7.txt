Solid spot with solid food and drink offerings. We always forget about Rooster's when we're racking our brains for dinner spots. On the occasion that we remember them, we're never disappointed. We've sat in their dinning room for a special occasion (happy birthday to meeeeeeee, I'll have the scallops!) but more often than not land at the bar. It's more laid back and there's almost never a wait. \n\nAny meat or seafood dish is going to be a win at Rooster's. We love the BBQ chicken and scallops. On our most recent visit, I had a daily special -- lamb bolognese gnocchi. It wasn't as good as Bruce Moffet's gnocchi but it wasn't bad either. \n\nWe even love grabbing a couple beers and a charcuterie board. Depending on which 5 meats and cheeses you select, price ranges from @ $22-$28. A steal when most of the meats and cheeses on their own will run you $8-$10.
