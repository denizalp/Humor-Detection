Specialty food should be special. There should be a reason why you pay a bit extra for a few morsels of goodness. Reid's has a lock on these specialty foods with a nice looking meat department, array of choice cheeses and impressive wine selection. Let's break down this location a bit, shall we?\n\nThe Good: As mentioned, it's a great spot to grab a quick bite, snag a bottle of wine, some tasty snacks and get on your merry way. The service is pretty spectacular - whether your seeking said bottle of wine or dining on a sandwich during lunch. Many of the sandwiches and salads I saw coming around looked fresh and delicious. Also, there's a decent sized wine bar next to the wine vault\/selection area that could kick your feet up while you taste away. \n\nThe Meh: The parking is pretty much horrendous. Unless you're stealing parking from business across the street, you better be comfortable walking a ways. The sandwich I ate here was underwhelming - the grilled pimento cheese was gut busting-ly greasy (granted, it's grilled pimento cheese) and also missed the zing I was looking for. I barely got through half of the sloppy mess and had to put it down for fear that I may have a heart attack in the shop. \n\nIf I'm walkin' around Selwyn and need to score a few snacks before heading home, Reid's is a fine choice, yet they definitely have plenty of competition in the area if we're talking tasty sandwiches and wine tasting!
