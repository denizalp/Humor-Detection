I'm actually writing this while on a flight to Halifax.  Porter is probably the friendliest, efficient and enjoyable airline provider there is.  Everything from the speed of the check-in to the free booze and food on the plane just enhances the experience even further.\n\nCheck-in is pretty painless, probably because you don't have the heard of people that's usually at person going through security, boo.  They've also re-vamped the \"snack area\" and rearranged some of the stuff there since I was last here.  You still get your latte\/cappuccino machine but now they also serve starbucks drip coffee!  Hurray!\n\nAs for the in-flight snack, I just finished my in flight snack of a small chicken baguette and a can of steam whistle (they did have wine choices as well [jackson triggs black or white, great choices]).  The baguette was ok, kinda dry, but you can't complain, it's airplane food and it's free.  Along with it came a tiny container of bowtie pasta with pesto, again, wasn't amazing but better than your usual bit & bites or cookies (PS. no one likes these, serve real food... or booze... everyone likes booze).\n\nAs long as porter keeps within a reasonable price range, I will fly with them hands down.  I don't even care if I have to have a stop-over to go to halifax... at least porter will keep me boozed up for the flight.  Suck it Westjet... I hate your bits & bites.
