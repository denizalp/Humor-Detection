Ok Best Buy... you're forcing me to tell the truth about you.  I get that you upgraded and made yourself look all shiny and new but in that new shiny exterior, you're really frontin' a lawn mower engine under the hood.  It's sooo sooooo frustrating.  I am going to go out of my way next time to buy anywhere else but here.\n\n\nSo went to buy something supposedly easy ... like it's available at Toys R Us probably and should only take me 2 minutes to find and walk to the cashier.  It took me 30 minutes to just even find an item that should be a simple pick up and buy.  This turned into a futile adventure of aggravating searching in haphazard labeled and scattered shelves with long times to even talk to a disinterested and mad looking associate.  \n\nIf I were them... I'd be mad too.  Actually I am mad.  Let's just say Best Buy and I can't be friends anymore.
