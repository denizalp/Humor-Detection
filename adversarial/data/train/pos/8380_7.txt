I went here to try to sell two rings my grandmother gave me.  They took one look at me, and judged me based on my skin color and visible tattoo, assuming I was trying to sell stolen jewelry.  \n\nSeems that even with that assumption, they were willing to buy from me, offering me an insulting $150 for a 2 carat 18k gold diamond ring and a 1\/4 carat 14k white gold blue diamond ring.  $150!!!!  \n\nDo not bring your business here, if you don't fit in with the \"Snotsdale\" crowd, you will be judged and insulted.
