My cat (http:\/\/twitpic.com\/paiha) used to have bad breath. He also used to have skin problems. He used to lick himself in his bathing suit area until there were bare patches where there used to be fur. He was a sad sight, and you could smell him across the room.  \n\nEnter Front Street Animal Hospital.\n\nThe good:\n- It's close to where I used to live.  \n- They really like my cat and when he escaped from the exam room they weren't too stressed about where he could get to.\n- They tricked him into getting in his cat carrier without incident (usually... this comes with incident).\n- They clipped his nails while he was under the anesthetic getting his teeth pulled.\n\nThe cons:\n- It's far from where I live now.\n- The cat food they have convinced me to buy for him is very expensive compared to grocery store cat foods and they never have big bags of old fat cat food in stock so I have to go back more often because his food only comes in little bags.\n\nI would take Fins here anytime he needed to see a vet.  I like them, they have debit and take credit cards and they showed genuine affection towards my cat.
