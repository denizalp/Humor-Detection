Great little restaurant! The food is very good..tastes homemade. The service is great..my only complaint is that the bar is very limited to wine and basic beer..so don't expect a fancy drink here. Although, the owner did give our entire party of 8 a complimentary liquore at the end of our meal. The space is very tight so don't go hear if you want to have a very intimate conversation..but it reminds of lots of little Nyc restaurants where you sit shoulder to shoulder. Love the place! Food is authentic Italian..I say try it! \nOh, and we went there one night in the summer and turned out they were going to close because the power was out..I was so disappointed that they offered to set us up a table on the sidewalk out front and serve us there or inside by candlelight..which we chose since the front is not too appealing. Well..once others saw us in there, they came in and the place ended up packed in the pitch dark! We had a fun time! If that doesn't say the place is good, I don't know what does if we all willing to eat there in the dark! Ha. The owners and staff are real troopers!!
