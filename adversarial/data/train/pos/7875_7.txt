My second time here and I can confirm my positive first impression of this place wasn't a fluke...\n\n4 Food\n5 Service\n4 Value\n\nThe food was good...we stuck mainly with the thin ribeye, bulgogi and the galbisal out of the dozen or so options offered. The spicy pork bulgogi was also a hit. \n\nI like my Kimchi a little more funky\/strong but I'm an unusual white boy. I also wish they offered full lettuce leaves with which to make an Asian lettuce wrap with the grilled meat rather than the lettuce strips in a bowl.\n\nAppetizers:\n\nSTAY AWAY from anything that is fried\/breaded as the breading was way heavy. Popcorn shrimp: 80% breading (seriously could not see the shrimp) Pork cutlet 60% breading. Fried squid about 70% breading...and the breading was salty. No thanks. \nDO GET the K.F.C chicken. It's like orange chicken but with a slightly spicy Korean sauce coating it.\n\nI see people complaining on yelp about having 4 different servers and not knowing who their server was...I see this as a positive. Due to the amount of servers floating around, my glass was never half empty, the side dishes were always refilled, our next round of meat orders were taken even before the current one could hit the grill. Our grills were changed frequently without having to ask. Waiters were friendly and extremely attentive. Why would I want to hunt down \"my server\" if I needed a grill change? I felt things ran smooth.\n\nValue was spot on. For $20 I walked out extremely satisfied. I could definitely see myself coming here monthly if they opened one up in Summerlin...driving way out to the bowels of Henderson is a schlep.
