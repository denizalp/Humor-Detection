This place used to be a Buffalo Wild Wings, and I gotta say, I like The Draft better.  I was impressed with their selection of draft beer, the TVs were big and well placed, and I think they have a much better menu than B-Dubs.  I got the fried shrimp appetizer with fries, and it was excellent.  The only reason I wouldn't give them 5 stars is because of the prices, ie value.  The beers are pretty expensive compared to other similar sports bars, as well as the other menu items.  \n\nAs a side note, I went there with a friend to watch the Broncos game, and the Cardinals game happened to playing at the same time.  If I ever go back to The Draft, I will definitely avoid it during a Cardinals game.  That's no reflection on the restaurant itself, but it was obnoxious in there.
