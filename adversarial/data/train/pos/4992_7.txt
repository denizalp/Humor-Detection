Came here Saturday night while in town for church, a.k.a. Hot Mass. Drawn by Latin cuisine and a free sangria upon check-in from the Yelp app, we walked in and, seeing no host, no host stand, and no sign saying \"please wait to be seated\", made our way to a table in the back. A server approached and asked if someone sat us. I said \"no, ...\" along with all the stuff I just typed out in the preceding sentence. He said no problem, but went to retrieve menus for us.Upon his return, he waited patiently while we obtained and presented our check-in offers. \n\nMy compadre had never had ceviche, the national dish of many a Latin American country, and perhaps the honorary dish of South America as a whole. Seviche offered a handful of interpretations available with a modest selection of different seafood options, from standards like tuna and salmon, to cobia, and yellowtail. We ordered the fire + ice and the beet + orange with tuna and yellowtail. \n\nBefore the ceviche even arrived, we were talked into some empanadas and pan con chihuahua. When the ceviche did arrive, we dove right in. The fire and ice ceviche is served as six shooters, so we toasted our trip and downed the first of three. It was delicious. Really satisfying. Being the signature dish, it was going to be hard to match, and the beet and orange was great in its own right, but definitely didn't surpass the first. \n\nNot soon after, the tapas made their way to the table. I opted to try the pan first, while my travel companion sampled the empanada. The pan con chihuahua ended up being my favorite dish of the night. the pork belly and pepper puree were exquisite, and the cheese didn't hurt either. I wished I had one or two more, but settled on my empanada instead. Having ran out of pork empanadas earlier in the night, the kitchen was serving up a chicken empanada instead. I was not disappointed, but do wish I had saved that pork belly for last. Now I know better for next time.
