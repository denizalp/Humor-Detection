After hearing about it on a few occasions, we finally visited this sweet little pie shop in Spruce Cliff. It's just as cute as can be, more spacious than expected and offers a good selection of sweet and savoury options. We were greeted right away by a staff member, who gave us a friendly intro to the flavours. We were there around 11am on a Saturday, and there were plenty of pies to choose from. \n\nWe had the Aussie beef ($8), which was wonderfully moist inside and flaky outside. It would have been even better if it had been heated more thoroughly before serving. Their sweet pies are beautiful, although quite small considering their $15 price tag. We ended up taking home a strawberry-rhubarb for a friend.\n\nPlenty of seating at three large tables indoors and patio sets outdoors. The line up for the cash register is a little inconveniently close to the middle table, so you might feel a bit crowded there.\n\nOverall a lovely experience and a nice place to go for some tea and pie ;). A little pricier than expected, so we'll save this for special occasions.
