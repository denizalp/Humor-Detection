local love....is what they call it here. \n\nThis bar puts almost every other bar to shame. \n\nThe Egyptian chef in the back is crazy talented and makes the greatest dishes!.\n\nThe venue can seat a medium sized bar easily. There's always something happening here. Ton's of locals and 2 girls bartender here are my friends. Naturally, we have way too much beer than we can handle. \n\nThey play all the sports games and fights here. The staff is really friendly. \nThey will always refill your drink or get you a new one if you don't like yours and\/or get you extra sauce without charging you. \n\nOddly, the food is the reason I come here. It's SO cheap but the quality of food is unbelievably good. Unlike other bars, the place is neat and very cautious of drunken rowdy crowds. It's an extremely welcoming atmosphere. \n\nThey have the Pump breakfast for $3.99\n2 eggs - any style\nhashborwns\nsausage\nham\nbacon\n2 pieces of toast\ncup of Orange or apple juice. \n\nRidiculous. \n\nthe quarter chicken with 2 sides is %5.99\nask for the Portuguese sauce over it. It's fantastic!. \nThe salad is almost always fresh, the wings are damned good. They aren't as big but grilled perfectly, with extra sauce on the side. Yummmm. \n\nif you're ever here ask if Victoria is working. She'll hook you up. \n\nxoxo\nM.
