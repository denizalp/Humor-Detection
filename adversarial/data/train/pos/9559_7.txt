La Gourmandine was high on my list. I was determined and I ended up expending much effort in the behalf of my visit. I had to run here (literally), my belly full of pork schnitzel (not joking), blood spewing from my nose (again, I don't lie much), just to quickly snatch an Almond Croissant before they closed. Was it worth it? Is that even a question? \n\nFor me the only obvious comparison was Gaby et Jules, since I haven't been to Jean-Marc yet. They differ greatly. If Gaby is a piece of marble, then Gourmi is a brick. Not a bad thing, just way different, less polished. With comfort food instead of edible art (albeit art that is incredibly fine-tasting). La Gourmandine is soft and calm and specializes in similarly designed bread based pastries. So I don't know what else and how else to say other than this: the Almond Croissant is absolutely stunning. It was a thing of dreams. Dreams that take place in the hearts of Frenchmen and Lawrencevillians alike. \n\nBuuut, (here it comes; it wasn't quite perfect) the La Gourmandine people seemed slightly grumpy, especially when compared to the shine-your-shoes-just-for-buying-a-macaron grade of service at Gaby et Jules. And speaking of which, La Gourmandine's were far from perfect. Too crunchy and sugary; better stick with the the croissants. So I still like Gaby a bit better. (I'm sorry, ok!) Really, Gaby and Gourmi together is less of a comparison and more of a conclusion. Between the two, they have everything you might ever want. All ye Pittsburghers have no excuse to not be so happy.
