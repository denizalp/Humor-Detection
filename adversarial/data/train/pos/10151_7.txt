This company is nothing but a bunch of bullies they drive around sticking stickers all over ppls vehicle. My vehicle had temporary tags on it located on the windshield and they still tagged my vehicle with a bright orange sticker impossible to remove luckily I removed it. Rest assured that I will order my own set of orange stickers and place it on any Ashley's Towing vehicle I see.
