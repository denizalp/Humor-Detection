A gator bite in Scottsdale tonight!\n\nFrom those who bring you Kazimierz World Wine Bar and Cowboy Ciao, (and in the space adjacent to the latter), you will find Counter Intuitive. \n\nHere, you will imbibe the likes of \"Cuffs & Buttons\" (brandy, sloe gin, etc), Sazerac (with a take-away flask, should you choose & we did since we had a nice \"Arizona Cocktail Week\" promo price) or a good old Pimm's Cup. You'll enjoy the kind of fare as determined by theme - the current being \"New Orleans Estate Sale\" -complete with a fictional character, his obit on the back of the menu and a curious selection of personal items inspired by this character. These items are available for viewing at the front door. \n\nFoodwise...think beignets and rabbit rillettes, gator bites and gumbo. We loved the shrimp remoulade deviled eggs ($2 per) as well as the bacon beignets ($8 heap) though my tastebuds can't vouch for the bacon content. Our server brought one from the kitchen (pre-cooked dough) to show the bacon bits. There are flecks but I need chunks, I imagine. Service was exceptional for a second night open. \n\nThe lights are low. The spirits high. We enjoyed. \n\nOpen 10 pm - 2 am, Friday and Saturday only for cocktails and late night bites. All other times the space is available for private party rental.
