It's 6:01 and I'm banging on the door begging to let me in and they won't help me. Nor will they look at me they make the security guard do it. Little did they know.... \n\nI'm a new customer and had to come to the bank because i still don't have my debit card and I'm going out of town in the morning. \n\nIn 15 years banking with Chase, the handful of times I was in a pinch and ran to the bank they ALWAYS helped me
