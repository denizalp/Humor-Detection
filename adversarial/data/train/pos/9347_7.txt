Perfect example of a group of people so desperate for Chinese food that they actually eat here and rate this place above a 1 star. \n\nREALLY PEOPLE?!?!? Explore the world some and learn what good Chinese food is. \n\nThe place is filthy. From the floors to the seats to the tables to the doors to the walls. You are welcomed with the over powering smell of what the...is that the smell of food poisoning??? There is grease in the air. This place is just nasty. \n\nThe crab puffs were nasty and they serve you the dipping sauces in a plastic container for one person yet you have 6 puffs to share with 4 people. \n\nThey have no alternatives to soda other than water. No milk. No juice. They apparently ran out of ice tea....WHAT THE???? Tea is 90% of your business. \n\nLet's see they also served the appetizers after the entrees and by the time I got the plastic cups of sauce the puffs were cold. \n\nThe meat was animal grade quality grizzle and fat in the beef. Chicken was hacked up with tendons and ligaments. Steamed veggies were steamed to goo. Fried meats were soggy. \n\nThe only thing that was good was the water...perhaps it was the slight taste of tap water chlorine that made it refreshing...it certainly was the cleanest thing in this restaurant. \n\nGo somewhere else people!!!! I'm going home to  shower and vomit!
