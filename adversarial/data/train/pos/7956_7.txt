I was just thinking something about this mall and I just had to post this: I am generally not a fan of malls. I hate crowds anywhere so that probably taints my opinion of a lot of places.  My wife and I went yesterday. For a mall I guess it's pretty good.\n\nI've been coming to the Metro Mall ever since I moved here years ago. It was my favorite. I guess in some odd way I can't really explain it still is my favorite. Maybe it's nostalgia I don't know. that being said this mall has really gone downhill in the last couple years. Ok maybe longer. Much longer.... I know compared to other malls around the valley this is not much of a the happening mall  anymore. Like I said for some reason I still have a fondness for it.\n\nEven though this mall has declined in the number of stores that are open in it over the years there still are some decent ones left. Like Macy's, Sears, radio Shack, Spencer's, etc. ....\n\nMetro Mall is very clean, and brightly lite. There is plenty of parking, extra security roaming the parking lots during the holidays. I do wish they had better restaurants in the mall but with their decline over the years many of the better places closed up shop. However there are plenty of wonderful restaurants to meets every desired appetite and taste around the Mall (Metro Parkway).\n\nDuring the holiday's it's amazing how beautiful they got this mall to look  and how  busy it can get. Go there during the week (even during the holidays) and there's no crowds. Amazing!\n\n******************* What does my OVERALL rating mean? ********************\n\n5 stars -Highly recommended.
