Finally -- made it to VZ tonight.  Had the guac -- yep, they had tomatoes, so rolled the dice...feelin' fine!  The margs were great, took PA's advice about the sarandeado sauce, too -- but had it on the shrimp...if you've not had it before, it's such a treat, particularly with their homemade flour tortillas - yowza.  \n\nWe also took the advice of Chris R --ordered two shrimp tacos -- but they were not in a league I'd consider worth reordering.  \n\nAnd we had an a la carte relleno -- which was damn good (I'm a serious green chili fan).   The menu is huge.  The bar is, too.  The dining room isn't that big, but we got there at 6:30 tonight (Friday) and sat right down.  \n\nLet's chat a second about where it is -- going north, you'll exit Craig Road -- and that's badly marked...(seriously, just remember, to take the exit after Cheyenne.)  Then you'll turn right at the end of the ramp, but you'll need to turn left at the first light -- then take an immediate right into the parking lot with the Pilot on your left...  trust me, finding the street number is impossible.\n\nThe menu is very similiar to the other Michoacans -- which means you'll get bean dip and salsa with your chips when you sit - and the other thing I've found pretty consistent about the Michoacans is that service is really terrific.  They're eager to please, happy to replace anything if it's not to your liking -- and the prices are reasonable.  \n\nAll in all, for a 110 degree day in Vegas, a trip to Craig Road for a frozen marg and some tasty dishes, that I honestly hadn't ventured to try at the others, made us happy.  There are certainly plenty of interesting dishes on the menu that caught my eye -- so I'd go back - and since we've got a Michoacan pretty much down the street (Viva), that's saying something.   \n\nGracias, Poly.
