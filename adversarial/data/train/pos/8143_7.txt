The previous incarnation of Ben Thanh (on Central, near the old Eastland Mall) was known for their food, but the building itself was a bit, shall we say, decrepit? When they moved into this spot, the food remained the same, and now they have a shiny new spot to match.\n\nIn fact, since appearance means so much, it might even have elevated the food - while the service and food has certainly not declined in any way, previously you had to wonder if something was about to fall down around you. Here, not so much. Everything is shiny and new, so you can concentrate on the food, and simply enjoy.\n\nThe pho is some of the best around. The bun is tasty as well. Even the noodles and rice dishes will stand up to most anyone. And the service is second to none, right up through the end of the meal, where they offer you these tasty little peanut cookies. Top notch all the way around, and if for some reason you can't get the picky eaters in your family to try it, send them next door to CiCis instead. It's their loss.
