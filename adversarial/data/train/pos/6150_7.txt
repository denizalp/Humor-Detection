I went in here because a girl in my office went here and she had AMAZING results this review has to do with their pricing and how they go about the consultation NOT the services that they provide.  I had saved up a significant chunk of money to be able to start a Medical weight loss program, For the services that I needing Plus the \"Free maintenance\" that they push on you  I ended up being quoted 1700$ I honestly felt like I was buying a used car. When I told her that I had saved the amount that I saved and there was no way I could afford what she had quoted, she said let me talk to my manager and see what she could do. She came back to tell me that she could add a lot of extras in the package but could not budge on the price. I left feeling hopeless that I would never reach my goal because of the cost. If you're interested in where I did end up going and love it! Go check my other reviews.
