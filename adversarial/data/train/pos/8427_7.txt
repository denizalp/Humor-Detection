I've had better service at the rudest McDonalds... I went there with the hopeful intentions of a milkshake and ice cream sandwich. What happened instead, was a display of the worst customer service I have ever had. When I walked in, I was almost plowed into by the hostess, with a breathy \"Table for 2?\"... No hello, no welcome... We then approached the bar area, where we went to order two milkshakes. We were then told that they \"didn't have enough glasses to serve milkshakes.\" Ok, fine, I'll give you that they just opened, but if they didn't have everything, then they shouldn't have opened. \n\nMy Fiancee and I then went to Yogurtland, and on our return to sit on the benches by Double Helix, I see someone sitting at the front of the restaurant with a suspicious looking drink. I approach the woman, and ask if that was a milkshake, and she replies \"yes\". I then become quite offended, and as I walk in and ask for a manager, he overheard my question, and then proceeds to offer to make us milkshakes... Mind you, he is standing in front of the register ready to ring up my order, WHILE we are holding two full Yogurtland cups. \n\nInstead of apologizing and offering for us to come back, we were met with the offer of paying nearly $12 for two additional deserts, that would have been served with a side of disdain and \"well, you caught us, heres a shake.\" \n\nI've gotten bad service before, but for the life of me, I can't image a place not wanting to take my $12. \n\nIf you are thinking about going to this place, please, take your money and rip it up and flush it down the toilet. At least the experience will be more satisfying than spending even 10 minutes in this \"Customer Service Hell\"
