We had VIP, but it took us 1.5 hours to entirely get the entourage in.  Guys got in after 25 minutes.  Girls 45 minutes later.  The music was good, they did replay a lot of songs, but the dancers were hot!  2 seperate rooms (that i saw) and staff was entirely helpful.  Always refilling juices, sodas, and cleaning.  \n\nDownfall- they are seemingly racist- only letting mostly caucasians in.  OR chicks with really short dresses (w\/ or without butterfaces).  Very exclusive.
