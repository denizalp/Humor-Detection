This place is a wreck. \n\nNo cocktail toothpicks? Just go ahead and dump some of those nasty olives in the martini glass... \n\nRed Zin stored in the refrigerator...\n\nBartenders looking up recipes for staple cocktails...\n\nIf you're going to ask crazy high hotel prices, maybe you can offer service to back it up?
