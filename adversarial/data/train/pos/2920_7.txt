Ok, so this is a no frills airline. They tell you this over and over again. Not sure why the complaints. Some people buy a Hyundai and then complain it's not like a Rolls. Hmmm.\nNevertheless, easy booking process and nice to print your boarding passes at home before you leave. Go through security and straight to your gate. \nThe seats are smaller than some airlines with a little less legroom and do not recline. But really, how far to the coach seats really recline on any other airline? For a 1 hour flight from LA to Vegas it's fine. \nIF you can pack light and understand what you're in for, it's a less expensive alternative.
