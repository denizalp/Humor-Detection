When you get tired of DJ's and electronic music and you're ready for some authentic music made by actual musicians, this is the place for you.\n\nThe minute you walk in you realize that this isn't some honky tonk dive, this is a very dark, classy place, with a large bar and plenty of seating. The stage is well appointed and there's even an area next to the stage that looks to be a VIP lounge.\n\nThis is the type of place that you would normally find in NYC, LA or Nashville, so its a great addition to Scottsdale. It reminds me of the type of place where you might have found Johnny Cash, Frank Sinatra, or George Jones taking the stage back in the day. In fact, it wouldn't surprise me if this becomes the place where national musicians go to play a few unannounced sets when they are in town.\n\nGotta say, in just one visit The Western has become my favorite new place in town.
