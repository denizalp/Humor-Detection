The girls that work there have marbles for brains. Apparently 16 isn't the age to start working. We have tried this place three times and each time they couldn't input the address right. And hour and 15 minutes later they said they didn't have any record of it being ordered!! This happened 3 TIMES! The best part when I asked to speak to the manager the girl says she's the closest thing they got and hangs up on me! Those nits should be let go and hire people that can function and not be rude little girls to customers.
