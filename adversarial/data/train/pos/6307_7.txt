Now that's what I call authentic.   Why drive 5-6 hours south when one step through these doors will make you feel like you just transported down South.  \n\nIt's located inside the Mercado, but don't let the outside detract.  This place has all the charm to Mexican Street shops with a fantastic little eatery inside.  The aroma hit my senses like if I was at Nana's house.  \n\nEverything, smelled absolutely delicious and you could tell it was made from scratch.  And it may have been football Sunday everywhere else, but in here is was Futbol Sunday.  All the TVs were set accordingly. Talk about GOOAAAAALLLL!!!\n\nThe staff was excellent.  Very eager to answer any questions we had.  Extremely friendly.  \n\nNow for the food.  We ordered a few different items; Birria - this is a go to dish and so freaking good, Lengua (tongue) Tacos - These were very tender and done right.  Simple yet great execution.  That have a salsa\/topping bar for all your onion\/cilantro needs.  Also ordered a Torta de Pierna - (shredded pork, avocado, and sour cream) this was huge, but again was good. Top it all off with a Mexican Coke.  Food Coma here I come!!!  \n\nSafe to say I'll be coming back.
