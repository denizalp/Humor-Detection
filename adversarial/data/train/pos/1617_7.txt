All the reviews here are about \"Danny's love of cars and bikes\" or the tour of his shop, but what if you own one of his production bikes? I do.  The \"Nub\" an overpriced hard tail chopper that is impossible to get any customer service on whether its warranty work or even just a small question.  After only 800 miles of normal riding a weld failed that holds a bracket to the frame that the gas tank screws into.  When the weld broke it put a small hole in the tank which obviously caused a gas leak. Over all there's nothing special about it that stands out and for 23k there is a lot better options out there where your not just paying for some guys name that has a reality show.  From watching his show it looks as if he truly loves building these bikes (or having his employees build them)and taking care of his customers even more but defiantly not in my case. I've tried for months to contact anyone at the bike shop through numerous phone messages and emails.  I've owned many bikes from various manufactures in my time and have never had this much trouble contacting someone when I needed service.  If he's so busy and successful then he can hire someone to help with customer service, there's just no excuse to completely ignore your customers after the bike is sold.  I'll never own anything made by his shop again, the way it is now isn't what it seemed to once be. Customer service and quality have fallen to the wayside for money and fame.  There are a lot of great bike builders out there that don't have reality shows and still build for the love of creating a great bike.
