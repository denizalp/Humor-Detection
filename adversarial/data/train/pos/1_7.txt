Bottom Line:  Really good craft brew coffee.\n\nI passed Cartel Coffee Lab while on a short layover at PHX.  I noticed two things:  hip décor and a sign indicating that they serve some really good coffee.  Not needing another ounce of caffeine I decided to try Cartel Coffee Lab.  Although usually I just get a drip coffee I decided to get a mocha.  It had a very pure taste of coffee beans and cocoa beans.  It wasn't sweet which I liked.  It just tasted natural and genuine.   The upscale coffee definitely matched the cool vibe of the place including friendly employees and hip décor. After enjoying my highly caffeinated beverage I was ready to walk out on the tarmac and use my hands to push a Boeing 737 to the runway.  :-)
