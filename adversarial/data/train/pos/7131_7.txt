I am in awe that I gave Midwood 3 stars almost 4 years ago. Time to correct that! I must've hit them on the wrong day. Since my initial review, I am a regular at 3 of their locations. I can always count on their brisket to turn a bad day into a perfect one. Bacon wrapped jalapenos are my fave as is the whole entire dessert menu. Check this place out! They have amazing BBQ despite being a \"chain\" and are consistent across locations.
