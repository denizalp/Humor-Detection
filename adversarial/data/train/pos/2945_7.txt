I was right around the corner from Frite Alors and really wanted French fries. I pulled up my trusty Yelp app and Frite Alors seemed like a natural choice so away I went!\n\nTheir fries are served in a classical European cone and come with a choice of homemade sauces. I chose the Andalouse  which is a combo of mayo, tomatoes, and spices and it was quite nice.\n\nBecause a pregnant woman cannot live on fries alone (well I probably could, but it would take quite a lot of fries) I also ordered a burger. It was just a regular hamburger with cheese, relish, mustard, onions, lettuce, and tomatoes. It was really, really big though. I ended up eating only about half of it. \n\nI took my order to go as I was at an event around the corner so I can't speak to the dining in experience, but the people that helped me were fast and friendly. I was in and out of there with my much-desired fries in no time and I enjoyed them thoroughly!
