Horrible!!! We've been here before a few times and loved the food! Came back for an El Hefe dog and a Bloody Mary but couldn't even get in cause of their \"new\" dress codes prohibiting basketball shoes. Its not  even club hours yet and we just wanted to eat. retro Jordan's are $200 dollar vs some $30 vans that are ok. Our group will just have our nights out somewhere else, denying customers over shoes...really?
