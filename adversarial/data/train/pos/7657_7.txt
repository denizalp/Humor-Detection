I like the fact that there is a non-smoking hotel in Vegas. \n\nThe suites are comfortable and the location is convenient.\n\nOne thing I can never figure out about hotels, though -- why do their shaving kits suck so much? \n\nAs I was trying to clean up for the night, I figured I'd shave. It took going over the same spot 100 times hoping the razor would eventually rip the hair out of my face since the blades were too dull to cut anything. I gave up, and walked to Walgreen's with a patchy face.
