Me? I'm no fro-yo expert, but I do know what I think is delicious. And Piccadilly is damn delicious. \n\nI'm not the type of person who lives at Menchie's or the number of other Pink Berry knock-offs. I've been to one of the first PB locations in LA and it's phenomenal--yet I've yet to find something as good in CLE. That is, until I stumbled into Piccadilly. \n\nLocal, organic, responsible ingredients? Yup. Fresh, seasonal fruits sourced from the West Side Market? You betcha. Other sinful toppings, including hunks of cookie dough, cereal and sauces? All that stuff! Delicious vegan options that don't make you feel like you're being punished? Coconut milk fro-yo people. And it's de-frikkin-licious. \n\nThe best measure of a great frozen yogurt place IMHO starts with ingredients and then goes right to their original tart flavor. Yes, I skip those interesting flavors the first time around and try their tart with lots of fresh berries. Mind-blowingly good, you guys. I even sampled the salted caramel, which was also so damn good, but I just can't get over the original tart. It's their \"drops the mic\" flavor, if you know what I mean. And I can't wait to try all of their coconut milk vegan varieties! \n\nThere's plenty of room to also sit and have adult meetings while you feel like your inner child is doing cartwheels of joy. Really--because who needs afternoon coffee when there's tons of fro-yo to be consumed? I don't need those jitters. And as you shovel spoonful after spoonful of bliss into your mouth, everything just feels better. Meetings that are already fabulous end up extra amazing. Why? Because delicious frozen treats that are secretly good for you puts everyone in a better mood. \n\nLove x1,000, you guys.
