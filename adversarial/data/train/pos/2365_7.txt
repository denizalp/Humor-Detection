I had just driven my wife and daughter to the airport for them to have a weekend trip. I was so looking forward to having BBQ. I entered the store and the \"meat man\" was welcoming and explained the choices. So I got a multiple meat dinner with sides to go. \n\nGet home and there is no BBQ sauce! I'm left with dry meat and no F$%^ing sauce!  I couldn't go back and resolve the situation. So my dog got a pulled pork and sliced brisket $14 dinner.\n\nContacted the HQ for Dickey's and after a month there is no response. Screw them and this chain.
