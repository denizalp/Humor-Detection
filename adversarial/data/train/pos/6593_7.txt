Qdoba is pretty simple, form a line, tell the dude what you want, he makes it and you eat it. Its like Subway for burritos. Awesome!\n\nI usually like to go to Chipotle, but this Qdoba pulls me away. \n1. They move through he line with a quickness I have never seen before.\n2. The staff is really friendly and they always at least act semi happy to are in their store. \n3. It's clean and has a nice patio i can chilax on while on a break from work.\n4. They meat quality if better then other burrito places\n5. They have more options. \n    two different kinds of veggies\n    cheese sauce, high five!\n    gumbo\n    and a combo option so if you cant make up your mind between a quesadilla or \n          tacos, you can have both, or gumbo and a salad\n\nQdoba = winning!
