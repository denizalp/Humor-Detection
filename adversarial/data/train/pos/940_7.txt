This Dr. is fabulous! She works with You and she shows very genuine concern for Her patients. She has been absolutely wonderful for me. She is my Primary care doc. I would not see anyone else. Misti is a wonderful person and She will make your visit to the Dr. a good one. Dr. Song is knowledgeable , courteous, kind, and just wonderful to have as a doc. I highly recommend her to anyone who is looking for a new doc. Misti Song has earned 5 stars , I would give more but that is all I can give. Thanks Dr. Song for the care you have given me over the years! You are awesome!
