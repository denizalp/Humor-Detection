Definitely one of the better buffet places I've been to. The 'wok bar' was pretty good. Try the garlic sauce!\nI was a bit disappointed by the lack of sushi variety. However, it was of very high quality, especially the salmon sushi. \n\nDon't let the vast dessert variety fool you. I found only the waffles, soft ice cream and the mocha mousse to be worth while. \n\nBest of all, drinks are included! That's amazing!! Fountain and bottled!\n\nAlso, you eat for free on your birthday! Nothing beats free!!
