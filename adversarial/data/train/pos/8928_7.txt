Worst agency ever. I was with them for over a year and didn't get a single job, which is understandable as nothing is guaranteed in the industry, but I didn't even get an audition and didn't feel as I was represented. They never kept in touch with me or gave me any updates. I was never notified about being submitted to any castings, which led me to believe I wasn't. It was ridiculous. Not to mention, they force you to go with their overpriced photographers and comp cards so they get their commission. Avoid.
