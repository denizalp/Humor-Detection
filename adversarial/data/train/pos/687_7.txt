Great pizza for takeout. Love the veggie pizza and the meat lovers. Great crust, sweet tomato sauce. They are not skimpy on the toppings. Garlic knots were really really good. I also really loved the chicken wings with the hot sauce....my lips felt it for a while.\n\nFor take out and very decent prices (well at least compared to San Francisco prices) you cannot beat Biaggio's
