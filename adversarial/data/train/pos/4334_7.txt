This is the first time I come to this Costco location, I usually go to the Scarborough one. \n\nI was under the impression that all the Costco locations were the same and that the product selection was the same. Oh what a fool I have been! This mentality kept me from visiting other locations, until yesterday. It was a \"WTF\" moment for me because this location is not only bigger, there is more selection of products like coffee, and they have Tim Hortons here. The cold cuts they have ham just regular ham, the spices isles too has a wider selection. I have been a fool in not wanting to come to this location, it's even closer to where I live! \n\nThe biggest difference that I found at least is that there are staff walking around everywhere, I did not have any questions but if I did I was glad to see that there was someone I could ask. I am sure that like most retail employee they don't know anything! However, just the thought that they were there not knowing anything is comforting. I will be shopping here from now, I really do not see a reason why to go anywhere else!
