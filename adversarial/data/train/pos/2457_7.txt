I didn't choose this hotel.  I came here as part of the \"LA Sparks Road Trip\" for season ticket holders...  and they were playing the new WNBA team, the Las Vegas Aces in the neighboring Mandalay Bay Events Center.  \n\nI always thought of the Luxor as a budget hotel at the end of the Strip, so I never considered going there.  But it's actually not a bad place to stay.  Our room was very comfortable.  The bathroom was spacious.  They have a safe in the room (absolutely essential in Vegas), and plenty of room to hang clothes.  Our standard room in the East Tower had a soaking bathtub.   Bedding wasn't fantastic and towels are postage stamp sized and not ample.  TP is cheap variety.  Bring wipes.  You'll thank me later.   Or you'll pay $5 for them at the convenience store on site.\n\nFood options at the Luxor are not great.  We ate at two restaurants (the Buffet and Rice & Co) and both were quite bad.  But you're close to the Mandalay which has better restaurants.  Or you can always hop on the Strip bus (the Deuce) and go anywhere else on the Strip.  Which you should do if you have time.   We didn't have a lot of time and it was horribly hot so we didn't want to venture out...  but I wouldn't eat at any of the restaurants at the Luxor.  \n\nI wouldn't necessarily choose this hotel again - I just think it's too far for the full Vegas Strip experience...  but if you do find this as the only option, you could do worse.   Rooms are OK.  Front desk staff was nice.  And if you make sure you eat off campus, you'll probably have a decent time.  \n\nOH - I did win at the slots...  TIP - playing early in the AM is always the way to go...  great service from the cocktail staff and your choice of machines.
