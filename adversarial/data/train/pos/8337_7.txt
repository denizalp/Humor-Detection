So, Saturday night in Vegas for two local gals...where to go?  Let's try Carson Kitchen!  Heard it was excellent from all our foodie friends.  Reservation?  No reservations but call on the way and they'll put you on the list.\n\nWhen we called they said it was an hour\/hour and a half wait.  Shit.  When we got there, we were seated immediately and there didn't seem to be any wait at all.\nTeeny tiny super hipster restaurant.  We were seated right at the pass next to the adorable Cory Harwell, which was a delightful experience.  We got to watch every item come out of the kitchen.  There is a lot of love put into each plate and it was pretty obvious from sitting there.  \n\nWe started with the Bread pudding, yes, you read that correctly.  We overheard the staff talking about this bread pudding that had no home so my friend eagerly said, \"we'll take it!\"  Um, ok, we'll start with dessert.  What a great start, though.  So yummy!!\n\nDrinks took a little while to get and they were out of ginger beer to make the drink I really wanted, but I ordered something else and it was great.  \n\nWe ordered the salt and pepper calamari, which was very tasty for a typically boring appetizer.  My friend is one of those annoying pescatarians so if we were sharing an appetizer, it had to be non-meat.  It's too bad cause there were about 10 things I wanted to try that looked amazing like the bacon jam and the empanadas.  \n\nAt one point I inquired about the chicken skins we kept seeing and Mr. Harwell, made me a little plate of them to try.  Such a nice guy!  And they were ridiculously good!\n\nMy friend had the fried green tomato sandwich and I had the short rib sliders.  Both were served with tater tots.  Both meals were perfect.  \n\nThe staff\/service was great albeit stereotypical hipster central.  I think half-way through our meal our server donned new red rim eye glasses.  Very cool.  Very hipster.  The most hipstery thing that happened though was that Tony Hsieh walked in...he frequents all the hipster hot spots, as he is like the hipster golden calf.  \n\nThe bill was extremely reasonable.  4 drinks, 1 appetizer, 2 entrees and 1 side (cauliflower- so good!) and the bill came to I think $85.  Strip food with downtown pricing.  Love it!  \n\nOh, and on the way home we tried to figure out what our hipster \"names\" would be.  I think I settled on Schotti or Dylan and my friend landed on Irma.  We will definitely be back!
