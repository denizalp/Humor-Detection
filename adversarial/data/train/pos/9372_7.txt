With so many choices in Las Vegas, this would definitely be last on my list.  \n\nThe bland decor and OK service just don't stand up next to the many other hotels nearby. Food is so-so and the location leaves a lot to be desired. \n\nPlus, the lack of a casino put this property in a class by itself - where it should stay.  \n\nI'm shocked it actually still has guests.
