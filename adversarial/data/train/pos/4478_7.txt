I got the worst food poisoning of my life from eating here, and that's saying a lot as I have backpacked through southeast Asia. Gut-wrenching, child-birth-like, almost went to the hospital, kind of food poisoning. \n\nTo be fair, had I not gotten food poisoning, I would have given this place 2 stars. The food was stale, and the bathrooms seemed as though they are cleaned once a month. The place is pretty cheap though, and they do give you big portions. Yet, I have had just as big portioned, cheap, and yummier Indian food elsewhere in cleaner establishments in Montreal that didn't make me feel like my insides were self-destructing. Proceed with caution!
