This mall is awesome!! It is nice to get away from the busyness of the strip and come here. The town of Summerlin is a nice, residential area outside of the strip with lots of shops and restaurants too. Plenty to do in Summerlin without all the crowds of the strip. The Downtown Summerlin mall has an amazing array of shops like Victoria's Secret, H&M, and LUSH with nice restaurants and ice cream shops like CREAM! Definitely a place you want to go with good selection. It has palm trees everywhere with a nice, relaxing ambience! Can't wait to go back! :)
