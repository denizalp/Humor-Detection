This is my go-to store for everything that Nixon makes, especially watches. If I'm trolling Nixon's website and see a watch that I like (which let's face it is a probability of 100%), I can stop by So Hip... and they're guaranteed to either have the watch in stock or be able to custom order it for me. I recently put in a \"no obligation\" order for the ever-elusive black leather Nixon Chalet watch, which is impossible to find anywhere (even eBay) and the store called me a few weeks later to tell me that it was ready to be picked up if I still wanted it.\n\nBTW, the entryway reeks of bamboo at all times. The smell is really, really strong and you will either tolerate or loathe it. I've come to accept that that's just the way So Hip smells when you first enter.\n\nThey also have a decent selection of shoes, jeans and other accessories like belts and hats, but I mostly go for the watches and jeans as the other stuff tends to be too expensive for my tastes. \n\nAnd yes, there IS a fully stocked bar at the front cash, and it's there because for every $50 you spend you get a free shot of whatever you want! I've purchased stuff here at 12pm and they still offer you a shot (or they have pop or juice if you don't want anything alcoholic). \n\nLet me tell you it's QUITE bizarre to go back to the office and have your deskmate comment on your JÃ¤ger breath.
