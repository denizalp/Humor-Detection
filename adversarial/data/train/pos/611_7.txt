First,\nI only visit here since I live nearby, I have to remind myself that they do not stock Iams, Every time I come here, I am always looking for Iams dog food, However they do have a huge inventory of other options. We do end up purchasing other items, and our dog always enjoy what ever we take home, Staff is always friendly, and service is always good, \nIt's nice to have another option besides Petsmart.
