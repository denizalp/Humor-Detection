OMFG. Like who really cares about sandwiches, right? This place was bomb... Consistent, quick, and so damn good in every way. I like that the sammies aren't huge and I was even sharing half of that already smallish thing when I needed a quick bite before a drinking session.  \n\nTried the Hawaiian BBQ and my bf loved it. Someone else had a chicken, avocado, chipotle version and he loved it too. I had the Full Montagu and it was super filling and meaty but good. Next day, we tried the Caprese. So good too. Gonna bring all my friends :D
