5 & Diner.  Why do I keep coming here?  No, seriously.  Why?\n\nOkay, it's the sweet and sassy waitress.  She can sell me anything.  Even dessert, when I am not hungry.\n\nThe food is mediocre.  I recommend sticking with breakfast items.  On this last visit, we ordered dinner.  The pot pie was okay and included a big dinner salad for about $8.  Not bad.  \n\nI somehow ended up spending $40+ for two adults and two kids on my last visit, even though kids were supposed to be 99 cents with the purchase of each adult entree.  \n\nPart of the inflated check was that the aforementioned waitress upsold the dessert to us at $3.99 per slice of cake or pie.  Let me review that dessert now.\n\nCarrot cake?  Nearly inedible.  With two people splitting a piece, 1\/3 of it got eaten.  It tasted like it had been in a freezer.  DH, who loves carrot cake and could eat a whole sheet by himself could barely swallow a bite.  The 9 year old girl who ordered it said... \"this does not even taste like carrots.\"  I thought it tasted like a dry spice cake that had been frozen for a few months and then defrosted on the counter overnight.  \n\nCherry pie?  YUCK.  I split a piece with DD on her insistence.  I ate two bites.  I have to admit I am no pie connoisseur, but this was NOT good.  It was too-sweet, canned cherries in a tasteless crust.  Every cherry pie I have had before has had tart cherries.  I don't know how they got these that sweet, but it was just disgusting.  If a 4 year old who is usually never allowed sweets cannot finish off dessert, there is a problem.\n\nStill, the atmosphere is cute.  The decor is interesting for the kids.  \n\nBut if I ever remember that the food is blah, I will avoid this place.  I just don't ever seem to remember it until I am sitting there eating it!
