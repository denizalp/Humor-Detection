Okay, okay.\n\nI'm beginning to think that I was just a miserable person when I was pregnant. Every review was tainted by my nausea, extreme hunger, and inability to imbibe. So now I return to this review to add another star.\n\nMy husband decided that we would go back to B Spot for another early, casual Valentine's Day meal. We hadn't been back since last year at this time, and we just decided to make this a tradition.\n\nThe fact that we had a baby with us was NOT a big deal, as B Spot is family friendly. Unlike the extremely uncomfortable high-top by the door we got last time, we were given a spacious booth this time around. And we were seated immediately. This ain't no Melt anymore.\n\nOur waiter was great and NOT pretentious. We got a whole bunch of shit. Everything was mouth-wateringly PERFECT. Plus this time I could appreciate the depth and variety of their beer menu. Damn! Left hand milk stout on tap always deserves a mention. \n\nAnd I only wish we could have taken the spiked versions of our big-ass shakes to go ... But obviously not. It's okay, we have Kahlua at home. And I plan to use it.
