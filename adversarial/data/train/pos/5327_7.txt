Giving one star is too much when they really should be getting 0 stars. My coworker and I were just there, and we were waiting in the drive-thru for 25min. Making us late for work. We ended up leaving, and luckily there were no cars behind us or we would of waiting longer. Thanks for making us late for work. We were trying to call their number while we were waiting, and of course nobody would pick up the phone.
