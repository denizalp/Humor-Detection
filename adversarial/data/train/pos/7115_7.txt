Had a great time here last night, despite there being no Valet for some reason? Anyway, this is a great place to bring out-of-towners, it has a chic southwest feel, while remaining upscale and impressive. \n\nThe spicy shrimp appetizer was perfect, salad was crisp and fresh, my chicken was succulent, and a guest had the \"Big Ass Burger\" - which is a Roaring Fork tradition.\n\nHighly recommend this to people visiting the Scottsdale area. (avoid the patio in the summer when you book your reservations) Three of us paid about $100 total for dinner with 1 drink each :)
