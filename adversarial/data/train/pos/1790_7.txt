3.5 star\n\nCome to Abruzzo Pizza for the food... Don't take your date here if so she will be disappointed.. \n\nAbruzzo is located at a strip mall... surrounded by mattress and furniture stores. Since it is in Richmond Hill, at least I don't have this seedy feel. \n\n2 areas of the restaurant, one is for pick up and the other area for sit down lunch\/dinner. The sit in area is more basic remind me of a cafeteria set up... \n\nOn a Friday afternoon... for late lunch, this place was quite busy.. There are at least 3 cars with the Abruzzo Pizza signs on their roofs going in and out of the parking lot doing delivery! \n\nVince Special Pasta Fusilier ($12.50) \n- includes Italian Sausage, Mushrooms, Zucchini, Fresh Hot Peppers, Garlic and Light Tomato Sauce \n- Filling and hearty \n- the Italian Sausage is really lean remains me of Chinese preserved sausage... and it is not salty to my surprise \n\nAbruzzo Special Pizza Small ($13.50) \n- Consists of Tomato Sauce, Cheese, Pepperoni, Mushrooms, Green Peppers, Bacon & Onions \n- The crust is thin but not dried... still have this oh so good I am eating carb feel \n- The ingredients are generous and yes and filling! \n\nI cannot say Abruzzo Pizza is authentic Italian pizza... but is a good option compare to other chain pizza joint!\n\nServices here is efficient and friendly... a good family vibe! I do have a feeling I am eating at one of the pizzeria down at Little Italy instead all the way up at the Burbs!! \n\nOpen for lunch only from Tue - Fri. They accepts all credit cards!
