Was with group of my girlfriends on Sunday afternoon and they had mention going to Top Shelf for Sunday lunch, I had never been and thought ok cool lets go, I love trying new places out!\n\nWhen we walked in there was no hostess to greet us, we were standing around for about 8 minutes, then someone walked out with a to go order for another customer, I thought well ok she was busy with that order, but maybe someone should have let us know that someone was coming to take care of us and not just ignoring us.\n\nGot to our table, our waitress was Cindy, oh what a snarky lady she was.  \n\nChips and salsa were brought to the table, being my 1st time their I didn't know you had to ask for the hot stuff, the salsa brought to the table tasted like Pace Picante sauce to me, just flavored tomato sauce, but that's because I like heat baby! So when I found out about the hot stuff, oh yea I was in heaven! It had great flavor and heat.  \nWe placed our order, I ordered the lunch special, the El Pollo Grande, chicken burrito with green sauce, beans, and added rice to it  and came with sour cream.  It was taking a while for the food to come out and we didn't mind, but our chips did get eaten and we asked for a refill and our lovey waitress told us Ladies, don't forget your food is still coming in a condescending tone, we were kinda shocked and didn't know how to respond that, we just said well bring on the chip and more salsa please.\nThe burrito was perfect, it was a great blend of green chili and chicken, Food was good, service was snarky, if in the area might come back and give it another try.
