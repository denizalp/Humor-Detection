Ladlow offers a diverse selection of quality wood furniture at reasonable price. But it's even better when they are on sale!  Hint. Hint. \n\nLast summer we bought a old style heavy wooden desk that was originally priced at $1,500. We eventual got the unit for less then $900. Get deal and would recommend them to anyone. They're nice to boot!
