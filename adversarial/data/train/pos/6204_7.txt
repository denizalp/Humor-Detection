I recently was at this banquet hall for a wedding.  Before I even left my house numerous people kept calling me asking me if they were in the right location because it looked off.  It's in a strip plaza that from the outside doesn't look like a hall....it's sandwiched (pun intended!) between a few south asian restaurants. If you are skeptically wondering if you are in the right place...and tentatively walking towards the front door...then yes you are in the right place.\n\nI will admit it is deceiving on the outside -it is a decent size place that could hold 100+ people.  There is a small dance floor.  But then the deception becomes reality.  There are these 70s glass panes at the back of the room - perfect for a disco. There is a small bar at the back as well.  The decor would look lovely...if you turned off the lights.  That white shiny fabric covering the tables and chairs....well I nearly slid of the chairs because of how slippery it was!\n\nI went to the bathroom.  I will save you from having to read it.  Wear a diaper.  Or hold ituntil you get home. \n\nThe food was ok, although to be honest not sure if it was catered in or the hall did it.  It was buffet style.  The dessert was lacking - it looked like something someone just grabbed at a low end grocery store. \n\nOver all I'm are if people have budget limitations and still want to have \"I had my wedding in a hall and not my parents house\" type of experience then come here.  Just make sure to put some Valium in your guest favours so they hae a cure for depression.
