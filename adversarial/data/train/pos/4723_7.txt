Let's talk espresso for a minute. Fahrenheit Coffee is just what you need (and don't know it yet) when it comes to first-rate coffee. This little caf√© located on The Esplanade boasts large windows, a wrap-around bar and only 5 bar stools, mainly for you to sit and enjoy your espresso, macchiato, or cortado. There is no fussing around with wi-fi or an outlet to plug in your computer to write your novel. Fahrenheit is the place you come for a delicious espresso-based beverage and perhaps a coffee-talk with the knowledgeable owner, Sameer!\n\nFahrenheit is using Te Aro Roasted coffee, as well as Sameer's own personal espresso blend, \"Diablo.\" Diablo will be a welcomed addition to your life, I assure you. Sameer's 7+ years of hands-on coffee experience and his unsurpassed knowledge have provided him with the tools to create one of the smoothest, well balanced shot's of espresso I've had. As the taste lingers in your mouth you'll be longing for more. Rich and creamy, it also pairs beautifully with milk. \n\nRegardless of where you live, making the trek to The Esplanade for a little Fahrenheit love is a necessity.\n\nNote: Closed on Sunday's. They're also serving up cappuccinos, lattes, hot chocolate (a huge hit with all the kiddies at the school next door) tea, and pastries from our good friends at Circles +Squares bakery\n\nHonourable Mentions: \n- Location, location, location! Right across the street from a park, just west of the beautiful Historic Distillery District, a stone's throw from the St. Lawrence Market.\n- No 'drip' coffee: Only the finest espresso and espresso-based creations; perhaps a Chemex, or two, to spice things up!\n\nCheck out this 'First Look' article by Post City:\nhttp:\/\/www.postcity.com\/Eat-Shop-Do\/Eat\/May-2011\/First-Look-Fahrenheit-Coffee-a-new-cafe-on-The-Esplanade\/index.php
