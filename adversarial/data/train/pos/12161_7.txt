Why all the great reviews??? Maybe the Dim Sum is a bag 'o chips and all that but the food is horrendous...come on people...they're using Minute Rice, watering down the Duck sauce, and dishing out  egg rolls filled with celery. Portion size is what you'd get at a Nursing Home. When I asked the waitress for some fresh duck sauce..... because the one she brought was sour and not fresh she looked at me like I had five heads....... Disgusted with me she took the bottle and returned with 2 packets of carry out sauce which is worse than the sour one. She sure showed me didn't she. I should have realized what was ahead after that bowl of Won-Ton with ONE noodle.
