I guess the saving grace of this restaurant is the flavor of the food. The ban chan dishes were pretty standard but tasty. The bulgogi was good and the spicy pork was marinated in a sauce that had both me and my friend rhapsodizing over the flavor. But then, there's the service. I arrived at 1 pm on a Saturday and my friend arrived 10 minutes after I did. we placed our orders shortly after he arrived and it took a while before the server lit up the table grill's burner; I was glad when she did because since I arrived I had been smelling gas coming from underneath the burners and was getting a bit nauseous. Then we waited and waited ... and after a long while the heat had  mostly dried up the cooking oil coating the surface of the grill, and the meats still haven't arrived. Eventually, a full hour after we placed our order, the meats for grilling arrived, and they stuck to the now-dry grill surface during cooking. Nevertheless, the flavors, especially of the pork, were very good. It's just too bad that it took so long to get our food - there were only 4 tables (including ours) with customers. There was only one server and we wondered half-seriously if she was also the only staff member in the restaurant at that time.  So ... we certainly liked the food, but the very long wait made us decide that we would not be making the long drive to this place any time soon.
