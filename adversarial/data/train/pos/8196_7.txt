Just visited the Coach House.\nIt's quaint, small, friendly staff, and it's old fashioned classic diner food. My friend had the regular brunch, eggs over easy, toast, bacon, and scallop looking potatoes.\n\nI didn't taste it, but it seems like the meal was a good choice, minus those random potatoes.\n\nI had the Grilled Cheese. Perfect. Kraft Singles on white bread, seemed like pan grilled.. and nothing on the plate but that sandwich.\n\nDelicious!\n\nRecap:\nCoach House eque interior\nClassic Food (menu and way cooked)\nExtremely Reasonably Priced\nFriendly Staff\nNot a boutique
