I wouldn't know about the food or waitstaff, but was trying to make a reservation for my wedding dinner and told them I would prefer they not put the gratuity because of all the reviews stating lack of service when auto grated and the manager was a complete asshole.  I explained to him why my request and he got very defensive and telling me they have policies and refuses to break them for any guest and it is there to protect his servers which NEVER give bad service or anything remotely close to bad service, and that we probably shouldn't eat there.  REALLY? what the hell kind of manager alienates guests who is bringing in a large party.  If you are that sure of your staff, then omitting the grat for someone who is a server, used to bartend and manage, shouldn't be that big of an issue.
