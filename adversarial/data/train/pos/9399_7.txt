What's up with all these positive reviews? \n\nI'm sorry to say, but none of these speak the truth. Because honestly, seeing a decent rating for this place makes me feel so wrongfully cheated. Anyone would when they experienced the exact opposite: dreadfulness. It was an experience that left not only me, but my whole family petrified. We were all so repulsed to never go near or go to this place ever again.  \n\nWhat could have happened to this one customer among the many others? Why should I listen when there's a good general consensus about this place? Let's see. \n\nAfter going through taxis, retrieving airplane tickets, passing through airport security, and all the other mind-numbing thresholds you must undergo when traveling, my family and I were exhausted and hungry. We are vegan, so it was a troubling ordeal to find something to eat without dairy, eggs, meat, and etc. \n\nAs we were scrolling along the airport, we found Juice Express. A glitter of happiness twinkled our tired state to some level of awareness. We found food, and yes, something we can eat. \n\nNobody was there. There was only an old Asian lady at the front with short, black hair who spoke little English. We all asked collectively if the smoothies had \" yogurt or dairy\" and she said, \" No.\" Continuing on, we told the lady that we were vegan and that we couldn't eat anything with dairy, but all we got was a confused stare, half-attentive to what we were saying. She still said, \" All the smoothies had no dairy\" when we asked her a couple of times if all the smoothies were vegan.  The menu overhead didn't say much about what ingredients were used. \n\nUnsure if she understood us in the beginning after much explanation, we ordered anyway. While she was making the smoothie, we asked if she could put more bananas in it, since she only put half of a banana, and that's when she freaks out in a subdued, but boiling angry way. \n\nOur family just looked at each other in quietness, not knowing how to handle this lady with anger management problems. She dumped bowls of ice in the smoothie and heaps of water carelessly, even when we told her to do E-Z ice and less water.  With a bang, she dropped the smoothie mixer on the counter, while she was working, mumbling something and rolling her eyes at us. I almost thought I saw her nostrils flare and steam fuming out of them. Her face was taut like a violin string even though she was able to keep her face straight. \n\nWhen all was done, we got our smoothies, paid, and went, having a strong desire to put distance from that worker and us.  I took a sip of the smoothie and it tasted like nothing. It was bad. I couldn't eat it; I wanted to trash it. We did order it raw, but the one's we made at home were a thousand times better than that one.  I asked my whole family and there's were the same.I kept on telling my parents that we should have complained back to that monstrous, angry lady, but all my mom kept on saying, \" Let's just go. It tastes okay and healthy. It'll be fine. \" \n\nOur whole family let out a huge sigh of leaving that all behind us. \n\n We went halfway across to our gate, and something happened. My sister took out a long plastic piece out of her mouth. I looked at my mom, and she said,\" Let's go back. We need a refund. This can't be.\" So we go back in slight terror of what might happen to that lady with an already reached 100 degrees anger boiling point. We went, and told her,\" There was a plastic string IN our smoothie. We want a refund for all of them.\", since we didn't trust her what was in all of them.  And she said,\" We caan't. I'm sorrey, but our store doesn't do dat.\" After much complaining, she finally said that she'll speak with the manager on the phone. We wait, and when the manager picked up, the worker lied to her that the plastic was ON the smoothie cup not IN. My sister tells her, but she ignored us. \n\nFinally she said that we can have a refund. We get out money back. Without hearing at least a \"sorry\" from the worker, we go, but we hear her complaining, \" That's not right.\" I went to tell her that was \" bad service\" We leave and we still heard her mumbling unfairness when we the customers felt most unfair with the worker's revolting attitude. \n\nThis was the most frightful and horrifying experience ever. This is why I felt so wronged by these reviews on yelp. I just hope my long rant won't be overlooked as that one guy saying something different in a huge crowd banded together with the same idea, but instead, I hope my review could be useful to other people.\n\n Avoid this place at all cost. Nobody goes here.
