My friend and I wanted a little treat before the show we were seeing at the Benedum. They had a poster for a new item-an ice cream burrito. The out side was a waffle cone that the filled and wrapped like a burrito. I had mine filled with an ice cream called Coconut 7 Layer Bar. They put caramel and hot fudge topping. You can also get cookie crumbs and whipped cream but I chose not to add those. Gotta watch the calories, right??  LOL. The burrito was very good but a crazy messy item to eat. They give you your burrito in a small paper wrapper. The waffle burrito wrapper is soft so they can fold it bits too soft to hold like a burrito and eat. The ice cream goes everywhere. It needs to be served in a dish or bowl. \nThe 2 young men working were very nice. The store was very clean. It was the perfect treat before the show.
