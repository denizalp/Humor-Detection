I've recently had the pleasure of interviewing with a number of recruitment firms in the area and I can tell you from first-hand experience, VincentBenjamin is a very refreshing contrast to what you typically find in the industry. As soon as I walked in the door I knew I was dealing with a company that has high standards and takes pride in setting itself apart from the competition. \n\nThe office is very clean and organized with a fun \/ exciting culture. There's a strong sense of professionalism and it's clear that management cares about the employees and their success in the business. I get the impression that most people absolutely love coming to work every day, which is not surprising because VincentBenjamin was named as a best place to work by SIA (Staffing Industry Analysts) and has been on Inc. 5000 for the past three years in a row!\n\nVincentBenjamin is an expert source in the valley for placing professionals on a contract or a direct hire basis. The team at VincentBenjamin is comprised of highly-networked, specialized recruiters offering proactive workforce solutions to clients, candidates and consultants in the fields of Information Technology, Software Development, Accounting, and Finance. They define 5 stars in their industry and I strongly believe that they will continue to raise the bar for decades to come.
