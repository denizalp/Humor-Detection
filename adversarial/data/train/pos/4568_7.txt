Awesome place, so many good looking female servers and they had the one with the biggest chest cleaning the tables. :)  Perfect.\n\n My only complaint is that their Vesuvlus Volcanic burger was not hot at all. Tasted good but not Hot as advertised. It was so mild that  a Mexican would burst out laughing \"Gringo, you call this hot\"? LOLOLOLOL  \"You gringo's need more lessons on how to make things hot and burning.\n\n $5 pitcher of landshark beer was good. Got me buzzed quick.\n\n I would go to this place again for the great hot view and the burgers. :)))))
