What a depressing shithole... Every employee should be on suicide watch.\n\nI go to a post office once a year and it gets so much worse each time. When are they going out of business again??\n\nI went in, used a machine, dropped my box and left. EVERYONE in line looked miserable. The one employee I spoke with was friendly, the others looked like they were about to cry at any minute.\n\nThe location is convenient, but it's the only post office in the area. The parking is well laid out and the entrances and exits will get you to either road in either direction safely. On the inside, it is FILTHY and sad. The floor must not have been swept since it opened. The counter tops were unkempt and disorganized.\n\nI came home, hugged my cat and took the rest of the day off to appreciate that I do not have to visit a post office again anytime soon.
