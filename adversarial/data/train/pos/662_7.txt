They keep the nutella croissant an \"open air\" secret. It's there. Perched right next to the regular croissants, but there's no sign distinguishing it from the regular croissant. Only an insider would know. (Thanks to Vivek S for his insider knowledge). \n\nA mass line forms and fades away faster than you would think. The baristas have it down to an artistic science. And my double shot americano proved that point. Loved that it came in glass complete with a knitted rainbow sleeve. \n\nAs for the famed nutella croissant. It's a smart invention. Forget a chocolate croissant whose insides stiffen once cooled, a nutella stays spreadable, yet not melted for your eating pleasure! But I don't think it can hold a candle to my true love, an almond croissant. Other than that - all I can say is \"Yay Jimmy - you lit my fire!\"\n\nPS. Cash and debit only.
