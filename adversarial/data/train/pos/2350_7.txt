Stopped in while roaming the Melrose\/7theAve Street Fair.   I have always been a fan of shops that specialize in Antique\/Reclaimed\/Refurbished items. You never know what you are going to find in the nooks and crannies.  Shops like this are always an adventure (hit or miss for some).  They have a relatively large interior with a couple of rooms of stuff.  They also have a patio area with more items.  \n\nSince I was just browsing and not looking to buy necissarily I paid no mind to the fact that I was left alone to look...which I generally prefer anyway.\n\n They have a varied selection of indoor and outdoor furniture and other decorative accessories. \nI really need to got back and take a closer look.
