Absolutely horrible and unprofessional experience.  I would NOT recommend this law group to my friends or colleagues.  \n\nInitial call and talk to the lawyer was fine, but at that point I had not been charged with a crime, but I decided to retain them anyway.  The retainer was $1,000.  After 2 weeks and some discussion with my wife, I decided I wanted to pursue a different avenue in my defense, so I notified the Schill Law Group that was my intentions, and I would like a refund.\n\n2 weeks later, after still no refund, I was charged another $500!  Long story short, it took a full MONTH after the initial request for a refund, several unreturned calls and emails, as well as a threat to call the AZ State Bar.  I STILL didn't see my refund or an accounting of the \"work\" performed.  It finally took my filing a complaint with the State Bar for John Schill to call me and say that the money should be refunded.  After ALL that, I didn't even get the full $1,500.  Apparently, talking to an attorney for 10 minutes constitutes an hour of work and a $250 charge, as well as $125 to 'open the case file'.  John did agree to refund me an extra $125 from the 'hour of work done', but I still believe after all this headache, I'm entitled to the full $1,500.  Bunch of BS, and I still don't think I'll see an actual accounting of the supposed work performed.\n\nAbsolute RIP OFF.  There are better and more professional law firms out there.  Do your research!
