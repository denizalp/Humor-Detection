Meet up with some girlfriends on sat night at Carrabba's before we headed off to go play some bad bingo up the road. My best friend and I were not that hungry so a meal wasn't something we wanted, we decided to split some appetizers and desert haha, the best of both worlds don't you think?\n\nFor the appetizers, we went with the Bruschette and Tomato Caprese.\nThe Brushette had caramelized onions & crispy bacon in melted mozzarella, and that was perfect! The onions were sweet from being in the pan caramelizing, and the bacon had that crispy salty taste, salty\/sweet combo is one of my favorite things. It was so good!\n\nThe Tomato Caprese, oh I can't even describe in words the taste, it fresh, clean, summery, just perfect. The mozzarella was creamy; this was a great lil dish! So perfect!  \nThen we ordered the Tiramisu and the Dessert Rosa to split. The Tiramisu, was very eye pleasing when the plate was presented to us, but it was just too much for me, it tasted like a very drunk tiramisu, the lady fingers were very soaked in the espresso liqueur, or it could have been the rum in the cake, either way, it was too strong for me, which bummed me out because Tiramisu is one of my favorite desserts.  \nThe Dessert Rosa, which just by reading it, I wasn't very thrilled about it, but my best friend swore it was good when we ordered it. When it came to our table, it looked very plan next to the pretty tiramisu, but let me tell you I missed judged this little dessert, it's a butter cake that has this sweet cream, fresh slices of bananas, strawberries, and pineapples and whipped cream. I swear it's like this ice cream free banana split, dang so delish!!  I'll never underestimate this dessert again!
