We were already SUPER buzzed before heading out to Hard Rock.  While we were waiting for the rest of my friends who actually stayed there, some guy in the casino was handing out free passes.  Since our friends were guests and talked to the concierge beforehand, we were all on the list.  Our girl-to-guy ratio was about 5-1, so we waited for only a few minutes.  We got in for free, but the rest of our party (guys AND girls) had to pay the $20 cover!  wtf?!  \n\nThe music was reminiscent of my iPod when it's on shuffle.  80's music transitions into hip-hop, which then transitions to Top 40.  Kinda weird, but I still managed to dance on the overcrowded dance floor.  There is NOWHERE to sit if  you didn't splurge for bottle service.    Overall another drunken night in Vegas, but thinking back on it while I'm sober only allows 3 stars.
