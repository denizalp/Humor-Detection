It's been a few years since I've been here and apparently forgot what I loved and what I hated about this place. I do recall when it was better and felt like home but today the food was disappointing the service almost robotic. \n\nI think I'm done here nobody likes a cold breakfast unless it's cereal. The eggs were cold, the potatoes half raw and lacked any sign of ever touching a grill, the bacon was hours old and the coffee well the one cup I had was okay but getting a refill was impossible.\n\nI remember having to wait in line to get a table today it was mostly empty a party of 20 could of found seats it's sad they lost their way.
