I'm a pretentious food jerk who only eats the best of anything and until recently, I was the only idiot who hadn't visited Vegas without needing a fake ID or parents. \n\nAnyhow, lucky for me, after arriving in Las Vegas at an hour too obscenely late for there surely to be anything open but a fly-by-night diner on the side of the highway, there stood Burger Bar...in a swanky hotel, without bean pole, Texas haired ladies in stilettos strutting outside its doors. (I would only later learn that fine eateries are ALWAYS open in Vegas.)\n\nStarting with the trio of fries, I found myself dunking perfectly crisp, perfectly plump salty slices of sweet potato, regular potato and zucchini into an assortment of sauces. Not since my days as a humble saloon girl had so many luxuriously creamy flavors of dips been set in front of me. The miraculous thing about the creamy, slightly spicy chipotle aioli, the sweet and savory white BBQ sauce (a Ranch + Masterpiece concoction any Kansan would recognize) and the sticky, smooth yet viscous honey mustard is that none of them were cancer inducing. Take that Skools!\n\nThe Kobe beef burger cooked medium rare offered a nice crisp sear on the outside, and when cut into glistened with a reddish pink indigenous knowledge to any mid-rare expert chef. Not only was this burger as smooth as a swig of the finest vermouth, but when topped with caramelized onions, chopped jalapenos and spicy ketchup, offers your mouth a loving amalgamation of meaty, sweet, savory, crispy and smooth. Ordinary burgers be damned...I'll no longer settle for anything less than Kobe Beef (I'm now broke).\n\nOh, and just to add a little bit more LDL to your already hyperactive blood stream, try a Nutella shake.
