My one star review is solely based on my float experience inside the pod and NOT customer service. The lady who greeted me at the front was incredibly sweet and helpful, and she makes the best organic hibiscus tea! I have nothing but positive things to say about her.\n\nA rare amount of people who try float therapy become extremely nauseous to the point where they feel disoriented and want to vomit. That was me. I didn't vomit though (thank GOD or else I would have been charged $500 for clean up), but I barely made it 15 minutes without rushing to the shower. The whole experience was traumatic in general... it wasn't for me. Also, my pod smelled like B.O. It was really bad. I couldn't relax because of how awful it smelled in there! Apparently it was just my pod because my husband said there was no such odor in his. \n\nI can't recommend this place unfortunately. Hopefully you aren't one of the unlucky ones like I am. The concept seems cool, but it's definitely something I'll never do again.
