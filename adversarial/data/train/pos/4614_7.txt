There are times in your life where you think something happens only once in a lifetime, like seeing a yeti, or Halley's Comet, or in my case, seeing the \"3 DIVAZ\" license plate in my local Smart & Final parking lot.\n\nFriends, I am here to preach that lightning struck twice last night.  The triad was in full effect, and it was like holding a rainbow in your hand.  A sassy rainbow.\n\nGrocery experience is still the same: Lots of food for reasonable prices.  I still probably need to pick up some Mexican Coca-Colas as my supply is running low.
