This is a hard review to right, because I'm frankly not the target market of their products, and if you're reading this and thinking \"should I go shopping at Brioni?  What's that?  A type of pasta or something?\" you're not their target market either.\n\nWhat is their target market?  Really rich men, or people who shop for really rich men, who have impeccable taste in clothing.\n\nEverything in the store is beautiful; their staff's Italian accent is real.  \n\nAnd they don't care what your latest fashion is; they care what will make you look the absolute classiest best.  As long as your classiest best starts (not tops out at, but starts) at $3000 for a suit that's not even fully custom, or $2000 for a leather jacket, or $500 for a wallet.\n\nBut that wallet.  You'll never see such a lust-worthy classic leather wallet, and they'll be glad to tell you how calf-skin isn't soft enough, so their use deer-leather for most of it...\n\nIf you're in the Wynn, do stop by to at least browse; as long as you're polite, they'll let you poke around at the items even if they don't think you're a likely customer.
