i really didn't know there was going to be so many haters on this review. but honestly this is the best thai food in the US. been here twice and both times were a mind-blowing experience. \n\nimagine 7 guys coming to lotus and sharing 5 dishes. funniest site imaginable. we tore apart our plates man. we shared the whole fried catfish, bbq pork, bbq beef, pad see yew, duck curry, and plenty and plenty of steamed rice. honestly i didnt know that such a lowly fish, such as catfish, can be cooked in a manner that really puts it up there with the more celebrated fishes (salmon, tuna, halibut, bass, snapper, etc.). the bbq pork was crispy yet moist. the pad see yew was pad see yew. we ordered it for a stomach filler. ahah. the duck curry with little grapes and pineapples were perfect. the thing that really blew my mind was the bbq beef. little slices of beef topped off with a lime fish sauce. o man. my tongue has never tasted those flavors before. it was like i landed on another planet. this is why i gave it five stars. this restaurant changed the way i perceive thai food in america. thank you lotus of siam. o and their mangoes were out of this world.
