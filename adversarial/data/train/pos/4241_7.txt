Happy place! Who doesn't like fried Chechen and waffle.\nI have been the downtown location many times. Make me so happy every first bite of Chechen,\nChechen is well seasoned and cooked perfect, Waffle is very moist but nice texture on outsaide.\n\nUnfortunately this new location need to learn a lot.\nMy thigh and drumstick was over cooked and dry. Waffle has nice texture and taste wonderful.\nServing was very slow. that I most concern.\nOver all pretty good food. Wonderful  new addition to Scottsdale
