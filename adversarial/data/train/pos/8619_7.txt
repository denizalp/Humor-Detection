BOTTOM LINE: I suppose it's better than nothing, but compared to other smart card systems from \"world class cities\", it's pretty abysmal. Oh, and their online complaint form won't allow you to use basic punctuation, like say, a comma. EPIC FAIL.\n\n*SIGH* Where to begin? The Presto system disappoints on so many levels, from its conception (see this G&M article: http:\/\/www.theglobeandmail.com\/news\/toronto\/system-builder-of-presto-fare-card-had-poor-track-record\/article6551526\/) to its coverage and to its execution, but this review will focus on its present-day user experience. \n\nLet's start off with the good: \n\n1. When it works, it's pretty seamless. You tap on, you tap off. You can set a predetermined trip to save you from tapping off (if you do this, however, it's not entirely intuitive how you \"correct\" for this should you get off at a different station)\n\n2. The auto-reload feature is a great function. You can link it to your credit card, which means you'll never run out of funds, or have to line up at a counter or a machine. HOWEVER, to do this though, you'll need to register your card, which will bring about one of the most frustrating issues down the line (see below point 2).\n\n3. If you ever lose a card, it's easy to report it online.\n\nNow, let's talk about many of its shortcomings - some are mere annoyances, while others are just mind-numbingly frustrating. And let's not forget, these have been ongoing issues since this system was officially released in 2009 (after 2 years of testing) - THAT'S 7 FRIGGIN' YEARS!!!\n\n1. Everything you do seems to require you to wait 24 friggin' hours before it starts working.\n\n2. The TTC readers (vs the GO readers) are utter rubbish! They can't detect your card even through your wallet, which means you'll have to take your card every time - so much for saving time! And they don't show your balance or time left on your transfer. \n\n2. While not initially obvious, a really frustrating feature, or lack thereof, revolves around its card registration process. You'd think that an online account management system and a card system with individual PINs would give you quite a bit of flexibility, especially if you have or need to register several cards, but you'd be very, very wrong. And it's this lack of flexibility that is inconceivable with such a setup, and its mindnumbing how rigid the interface is. Because of this, the only solution often REQUIRES you to purchase a new card.\n\nFor example, you want to transfer a card from one account to another (e.g., give a card to a family member or friend)? Can't do it, since you can't unregister a card. Ever. \n\nLet's say you have 2 cards and you lose one of them. You want to transfer the remaining balance to one of your other card? Can't do it since you can't transfer balances onto cards that are already registered! This problem obviously compounds itself if you have multiple lost cards you want to consolidate onto one card. \n\nAs you can imagine, this has led to a lot of user grief with lost cards who mistakenly registered their replacement card first before transferring funds from their old card. From a user interface perspective, this is such a dumb design decision. People shouldn't be punished for doing things \"out of order\" when it comes to card management, especially when it's all electronic anyway. I can assure that the warning on the website isn't the clearest either. And, once you've transferred your old balance to your new card, guess how long you'll need to wait? You got it, 24 hours again.\n\nAlso, thanks Presto for giving out the wrong advice on this: https:\/\/twitter.com\/prestocard\/status\/580830931549745153\n\n3. Customer service EPIC FAIL! First, they don't even have a customer service office with real people to talk to. Their online complaint form WON'T ACCEPT COMMAS OR APOSTROPHES!!! WTF?! You mean I have to retype my whole complaint without basic punctuation? Their offline customer service manager will call you back, leave you a voice mail that doesn't address your initial complaint, and then redirect you to their toll-free number!\n\n4. If you don't use the auto reload feature and\/or you don't trust Presto in keeping your financial information safe, the options you're left with are very inefficient or even impractical. You can logon online and then wait...24 hours before it's added. So then you have to find either a Presto counter or a machine - both of which are exceedingly rare to find and\/or are in low numbers. Case in point, at the Union TTC station, there is no counter and only two, TWO! recharging stations. Union GO station isn't any better. Hope you brought a book to read while you wait in line! Of course, YMMV depending on which station you're at.\n\n5. There's still no app for managing your account or adding funds to your account. Seriously?! Users have been requesting this for years. Sure, you can logon to the website with your phone, but I'm not sure how many people would do that.
