Holy macaron!\n\nThis place serves up some seriously decadent macarons.  Bacon maple, birthday cake, goat cheese and fig, nutella and, my favorite, peppermint candy cane, are just some of the fancy flavors they have in stock.  And, they are HUGE, especially the peppermint candy cane.  It will take you several sittings to devour it.  And, it's delicious, if a tad too sweet.  Prices for these run from $3.50 to $4.50.\n\nAlso, other genius things about this place are: (1) it serves alcohol; and (2) It's open late.  Like, 11 p.m. late.   \n\nI'll definitely go back to try more macarons, their moose domes, and cakes.  Everything looked amazing.
