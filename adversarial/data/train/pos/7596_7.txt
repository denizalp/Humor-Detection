i can review mamma mia?  yay!  \n\nso cute!  the story is a bit cheesy, but the songs are so fun!  \"dancing queen\" just made me think of our AJ singing karaoke at 25si.  i only knew less than half the songs, but i still loved the show.  it's just really \"cute\".  i went with a girlfriend which was a good thing.  i wouldn't make a guy see this show.      \n\nmy favorite part was in the end, after the curtain call, they came back and performed 3-4 of their most popular songs.  it was like being at an ABBA concert!\n\nmy gripe: you know you're in vegas when the concession stand isn't really a concession stand.  they only serve cold drinks....like alcohol.  when we asked for hot tea or coffee (which i needed because the theater was ice cold) they said no hot drinks.  ugh.
