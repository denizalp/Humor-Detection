Not everyday you meet a owner of a store who takes the time to talk to his customers and tell us about his business growth.\n\nOutstanding service! I personally wasn't buying anything and honestly did not know who he was until my friend explained it to me.\n\nHe even took the time to give me great suggestions on eating spots to go to while in town.\n\nWow! I was really impressed on his kindness.  \n\nThank you Jay for a awesome first experience to Urban Necessities!
