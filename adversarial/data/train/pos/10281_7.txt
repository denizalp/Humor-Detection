When our men are busy riggin', rigger-wives are out there boozin. \n\nI accompanied my hubbs during the Whatever USA tour in Phoenix. He was, for the most part, working til the early evening. I met his colleague's wife and we instantly clicked. \n\nDuring our first meet without the hubbies, we initially thought coffee, but said naaahhh let's go grab a few drinks instead.  We walked across the street to Twisted, conveniently of course, and sat ourselves at the bar. \n\nI loved the very limited but compelling menu. I was really pushing for the ramen burger, but we had lunch two hours prior. Instead, we got the smashed potatoes, a peach signature drink and a mojito. \n\nThe peach drink --- wow it was so luxuriously delicious. And the smashed potatoes were crispy outside, fluffy inside atop other creamy yumminess.  We had an excellent time and the staff was attentive though not obtrusive.\n \nThis would be a great place for a girls night. It's the type of joint you'd find in hollywood or new york-- highly recommended.
