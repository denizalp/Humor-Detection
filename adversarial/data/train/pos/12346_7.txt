This place gets 5 stars just based on the fact that it oozes coolness and style.  This place is not listed on the cosmopolitan website and directories, there are no signs, and you have to go through a dark hallway in order to find it.  The only way to know about this place is pretty much by word of mouth.  Pretty ballsy move by Cosmopolitan, but it's working out pretty well for them.  \n\nIt's a pretty solid piece of pizza.  I've never been to NYC and I can't tell you if this is authentic, but it looks and tastes how I'd imagine it to be like.  I got a white pizza with three different types of cheeses and I had it topped with roasted tomatoes and mushrooms.   It was delicious.  \n\nIt's open pretty late, so if you need solid eats after partying and drinking around citycenter, then this should be your spot.
