I've stopped into this shop every now and then since i went to school down the street in the mid 90's. Great location, classic coffeehouse decor and pleasant people. We had gelato there Sunday morning while walking the pooch. What a nice treat to have available for people who are not into eggs and sausage every Sunday. The coffee is the same mediocre product all Arabica's have been shoving down our gullets for the last twenty years, but that's okay. It's cheaper than Starbucks. \n\nHoly shit, i forgot the most important detail. This was where i first had a one on one sit down with my future wife. Not a date mind you, just hanging out.\n\nI kind of resent this place too. It was grunge loser central during high school. Cue Lemonheads song.....
