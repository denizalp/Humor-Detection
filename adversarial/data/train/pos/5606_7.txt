Like many other reviewers have claimed. Yes! This show is an extreme waste of time. I'm surprised its still going strong. I remember this show as a kid. It was more action less useless dialogue. I guess it's going for a more sex appeal type of show. Except theres really no appeal. Not even for kids.\n\nI suppose its somewhat of a tourist trap. Just to get you thru their doors at TI. The hotel itself is bad enough. The show only proves it from the outside. But yes the show is free. And yes, it's a good show if you need to kill time. But honestly your better off jumping into the dirty muddy water they perform this show on. Then watching the first minute or so. Remember folks you get what you pay for. In this instance absolutely nothing.
