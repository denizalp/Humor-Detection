It's the rare occasion I come here and there aren't 14 people in line and only 1 or 2 cash registers open. (They technically have 4 stations but in 3 years I've never seen all manned at the same time. I'm not sure why they bothered to add them.)\n\nFrankly, when I see this, I just leave my basket (usually with perishables) on the floor and walk out. I'm not sure why Shopper's can't figure out they're losing customers and sales by this really shitty service. I seem to recall Shoppers has some issue with the government and new drug sales regulations. Shoppers was threatening to decrease service and punish their customers. Is this store their test store for this new customer service model? Why have a Shoppers at a busy corner, 24 hours, near a subway station, surrounded by dozens and dozens of condos, and then only ever have 2 people working the cash.\n\nWho needs this shit? If someone opened a 24 hours Rexall next door, these assholes would be out of business. Pronto.
