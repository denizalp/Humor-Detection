Crepes + Happy Hour + live music and in-store events!  This little spot has a lot going on. Offering sweet, savory, and even seafood crepes, all are named after a city or country, based on the ingredients. They also offer an \"around the world\" 8-course option ($45\/pp, by reservation only) that sounds cool.\n\nHH offers discounted mini-crepes at $5-7 each with a drink purchase (they have beer, wine, and some sparkling water cocktails). I started with the refreshing Peach Ambrosia (a sparkling drink with fruit, apricot and orange flavors also available). The Greek crepe (chicken, feta, peppers, with a yogurt-dill sauce) was solid, as was their featured daily special (chicken, spinach, mushroom, caramelized onion, brie). I would come back to try more. \n\nNOTE: They offer vegan and GF batter options for an additional fee (~$2?).
