Do it.\nCrisp and modern design, well put together space with a great vibe and ambiance. Perfect for dates or but try to reserve a table for groups of three or more as most of the seats are at the bar. If your into restaurants and kitchen culture request a seat at the chefs table. \nMenu has a great deal of shareable items, nice mix of lite fare with moderate choices for plant based diners. Highlights were the mango & lobster \"ceviche\", the shrimp aqua chili. Pork cheek robata skewer was masterfully executed, king crab was a healthy portion of good quality protein. \nService Team was professional and patient, definitely a great culture of hospitality. \nLooking forward to getting back and trying the remainder of the menu!
