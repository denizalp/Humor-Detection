I have mixed feelings about Evoke.\n\nBeen here about half a dozen times and there is one hairdresser that I swear by. She always gives me the most amazing hairdos and on one occasion, fixed a horrible mess of a haircut I had a week after I came back from vacationing in Baltimore*. She works wonders! She is very sincere and also manages to make her clients feel comfortable in their skin. We always have good conversations** together. \n\nMy last visit however, wasn't so grand.\n\nSince I wasn't able to book my favourite hairdress, I decided to try another. On the day of the visit, the new hairdresser was prompt and greeted me. We chatted a bit about what I wanted and then went to get my hair washed. The head massage was nice and since I was in a good mood, I continued making a few jokes here and there. \n\nNow, I'm not an intimidating person, partly due to the fact that most people still think I'm in high school; however, the hairdresser began getting more nervous as the time passed. She wasn't really talking back or responding to me - I hadn't said anything offensive and had stuck with neutral small talk - so I just stopped talking altogether. This seemed particularly unusual** and in the end, we were the only pair that were completely silent.  It felt as if I was on a bad date in an Italian restaurant. The haircut that came out of this wasn't particularly impressive and although she said she wanted to \"add some volume\" - and even my mother confirmed this within an hour of this incident - she had somehow managed to flatten my hair against the top of my head. The part wasn't done well and my bangs didn't hang properly. While I don't think she was taciturn because of me, I left feeling awkward and confused (i.e. \"Why did my date go so badly?\"). While I won't ask for her again, I'm sure she's still a decent hairdresser, as others have pointed out on Yelp reviews.\n\nMost of the receptionists I've encountered are nice, but most of them don't seem sincere. Some of them seem generally apathetic and I feel as if they're looking past me with vacant eyes. Too bad the last person I often have to interact is is with the money-taking mannequins at the front desk.\n\nThere's only one reason why I'm come back to Evoke. If I had more money, I'd hire my favourite hairdresser privately so I wouldn't have to deal with the rest of the staff.\n__________________________________\n*There are very few Asian people in Baltimore. It wasn't exactly the best idea that I went for a haircut there. Hindsight is 20\/20.\n\n**Part of the unwritten rules of hairdressing is that the hairdresser should give you the chance to gab and get any stress off your chest by chatting about it.
