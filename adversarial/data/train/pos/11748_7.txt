After seeing Kristin's review of Xavier, I felt compelled to scrawl a little something about my alma mater, as well. \n\nFirst off, I should disclose that Brophy has changed significantly since I was there: the huge arts building, the new library, a new gym, and quite a few other additions have made it such that I barely recognize it anymore. \n\nThankfully, the crux of the positives are the same. The teachers are overwhelmingly good, with a few exceptions, and the experience is as positive as one can have in a high school environment. \n\nThe all-dude \"fratmosphere\" can be a little off-putting, but it is surprisely beneficial in a four year timeline. By senior year, the comfort of single-ed classrooms far surpassed the need to ogle ladies and allowed for many fewer inhibitions and insecurities as in a typical co-ed setup. \n\nBy the time I arrived at college, I felt more prepared than the vast majority of my classmates and even more mature, in certain ways. I am a far cry from a die hard Catholic, but the Jesuit style encourages and facilitates renaissance learning, which should be the goal of any educational system, as I see it. \n\nEvery high school has its downfalls. I'm convinced that it is an awkward time for everyone, but I guess my parting thought was that this environment actually spurred growth from the difficult nature of the common experience, which can't be said for many institutions of this kind.
