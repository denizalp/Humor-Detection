OLDIE BUT NOT A GOODIE.\n\nFor being the go to bike shop of the 80's, customer service in the repairs department to has taken a serious dive. \n\nI finally bought a Chris King hub for my bicycle, the equivalent to having the dopest rims on your ride. So I thought to myself \"bike world\" is the place to have this installed. This is the city where a few extra 20$ gets you moved to the top of the list or in this case your rim laced with a quickness. \n\nI dropped off some rims to be laced and was quoted 2 days, then called the next day and someone else said 3 days and that they got really busy. No problem, I can wait a few extra days. So four days goes by and not only are they NOT done they haven't even started... And It will be a few more days. So I call a week from the day I've dropped it off and they tell me they have to order parts now?\n\nScrew waiting any longer I'll take them somewhere else. I walk into repairs and the wheels are sitting in the EXACT place I dropped them off in. The \"manager\" walks over and says he does all the lacing and didn't even know they were there, but if he had known he would have knocked it out this morning. \n\n\nWTF. I had been calling since 9am about this order, and talked to several different people including the manager who said the same thing in person as he did on the phone 4 hours prior to me even walking in there about not having anything on his bench and didn't know about my rims.\n\nI think the manager needs a Manager \ncause this guy agreed with the ridiculousness of my ordeal and offered no solution to rectify the situation. \n\nGET A CLUE.
