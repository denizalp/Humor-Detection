Jade Palace has some pretty good chinese food and probably the best egg roll that I've ever had in Phoenix, the NY egg roll. My buddy and I stopped by for lunch not too long ago. The food was really good as far as AZ Chinese food goes. I had the garlic chicken lunch combo with lots of hot mustard and chili sauce. It was great! The prices for lunch were fairly standard, but I think the whole dish prices were a bit much when I think of grabbing some Chinese food. But, that my mindset so don't let that get in the way of trying this place. I will definitely be back to try more of the menu.
