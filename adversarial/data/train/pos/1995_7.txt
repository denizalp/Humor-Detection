Their specialty is tea and coffe (iced or hot) with a twist of boba (some pop, fizzle, and then the regular ones).  They have a huge menu with all sorts of tea\/coffee (please notice the names of the categories) kind of funny naughty.  hehehe!  Love it!  I got the Geisha with regular boba, was not ready for a popping boba in my mouth yet.  Geisha (green tea, with milk, and vanilla).  I loved it.  But it is on the pricy side if you add too many fun extras.
