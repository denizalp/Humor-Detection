We had a really nice lunch here the other day. The restaurant reminds me a lot of a Cheecake Factory. There were so many delicious sounding things on the menu that it was hard to order! We ordered the buffalo bites as an appetizer and really enjoyed them. I went with the Asian nachos because where else are you going to get Asian nachos?!? They were odd but good. I would probably not order them again, but I'm glad I tried them. My mom's chicken quesadilla was very good. Everyone else enjoyed their food as well. Portions were big and prices were decent. I would definitely come back here if I am ever in the area.
