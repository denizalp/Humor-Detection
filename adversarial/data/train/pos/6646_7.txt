I like Trader Joe's.  I do.  They are notorious for housing some tasty little snack that you just can't get anywhere else.  And their hummus is out of control.  Especially their olive hummus, which I should purchase in bulk considering how fast I go through it.\n\nThe customer service is always nice and friendly (here, and in any other TJ's I've visited), the prices are reasonable, and if you're like for something different, and nutritious, they've got you covered.  They don't carry everything, but you can still eat well off their selections alone.\n\nI do have one major, glaring problem with Trader Joe's.  It's not just this one, but every one I've ever been to.  What is the issue?  Other customers.\n\nWhy?  Come here for a second.  Closer... I want to make sure you hear this: You're in a public, non-exclusive, non-membership GROCERY store.  Get over yourselves.\n\nPeople hang out in the parking lot in their cars to talk, blocking traffic.  Walking around, there's this weird sense of entitlement.  I don't see how people can actually see the items on the shelves with their noses so high in the air.  There's no personal space.  People will walk right up on you, over you, to get what they want.  If there's ever a place that could make me claustrophobic, it's Trader Joe's.  Seriously.  Get up off my grill, yo.  See?  You've made me speak hip, urban slang now.\n\nTheir food, customer service, and prices are respectable.  Now if I could only employ a henchman to carry out my shopping in there, I'd be set.
