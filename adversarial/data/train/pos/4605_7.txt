4 Stars for the venue and event but sadly 2 Stars for the other Yelpers\n\nThe first YEE kicked off for 2016 in a restaurant where I have to say I was pleasantly surprised at.  It's located in office building and I was thinking whaaaaat?!  No good could come of this!  Did they want us to secretly photocopy some stuff on the side?!\n\nWell when I entered the space I was amazed - it's so gorgeous inside!  Definitely my design aesthetic- exposed brick walls, dark and sexy lighting, gorgeous light fixtures- I was in home decor throws of ecstasy!\n\nLovely drinks to start off the mingling and put you in a good mood....cuz you'd need it in a few minutes....just wait for it...\n\nSadly I'm not sure what animals some of these people were raised by but I'm pretty sure this restaurant will never host a Yelp event again.  It was like people hadn't eaten for days the way they attacked the food!  Scavengers!  Following the servers around with a hunger in their eyes that I've only ever seen on The Walking Dead.\n\nI only managed to try some blueberry dessert thing and the quiche...and only b\/c another kind yelper gave me one of his!\n\nI was too scared to try and even attempt to forge my way in to get anything- i didn't want people mistaking my hands for chicken fingers!! I needed my hands to drive home later.\n\nA pack of hungry wolves was surely disappointing to me and my plus one, but at the same time we also got to see a horror show....so maybe it was a win?\n\nGreat job Chantal and Kris for picking this restaurant as I would probably never have gone to it on my own.  It was a great event regardless of the vultures circling about.
