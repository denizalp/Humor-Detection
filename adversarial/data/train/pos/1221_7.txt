During my bike ride Sunday, I stopped at Greens and Proteins for breakfast.  Who would have thought that healthy food would taste as good as this did?  I was surprised.\n\nThe place was almost empty and after ordering my Greek Scramble and coffee, I took a seat at a table under the section near the entrance that has a roof overhead.  The young lady who took my order, gave me a post with a number so she'd know where the food was to be delivered.  She soon brought my coffee which was very hot and enjoyable.\n\nThe Greek scramble consisted of scrambled egg whites with feta cheese, kalamata olives, basil, green peppers, onions, and was accompanied by tofu home fries.  Their information lists this at 309 calories.  I wasn't concerned so much about that as I was taste.\n\nThe taste was quite good.  The olives brought out the flavor of the feta and the tofu home fries were a treat.  There were some pieces of toasted pita to accompany the scramble.\n\nI will stop in again and try something else.  The price was very reasonable and the patio dining was perfect before the hot days set in.\n\nOne note for those who ride a bicycle--few I know--there is a garbage can on the east side of the building and you can lock your bike to that with your cable.
