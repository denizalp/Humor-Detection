It was a frigid Friday night - one of those nights where any restaurant with the name \"fire\" in it would beckon you closer. \n\nFire on the East Side does NOT disappoint. Where do all the plus points come from? Here is my list:\n1. It was warm and we cozied into a booth\n2. The service was AH-MAZING. Our server was so attentive, made fabulous wine suggestions and was always there when we had a question or needed something (like hot sauce!) - and we were able to customize a few dishes to make them veggie friendly to work for us!\n3. The food was finger licking great! (Not that I ate with my hands or anything)\n4. When we didn't see anything on the dessert menu that tickled our fancy, our server made a suggestion for a place nearby that we would probably like (And we tried it out and it was fab - review up next!) ;)\n\nIf you haven't already, call them up and makes reservations!! Go!!
