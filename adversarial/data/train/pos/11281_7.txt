I question the validity of her dentist degree. I went back to have a filling from 15 years ago refilled because it was \"loose.\" The initial cleaning went well...the hygentist gave my teeth a decent cleaning, nothing fancy. But when I met Lolitza, I got a bad vibe. After glancing at my teeth she said I needed to come back to have my old filling refilled and I did because shouldn't the doctor know better than I do?\n\nWhen I came back I had a bad feeling from the start. I sat in the waiting room for 15 minutes until the receptionist finaly took my name (she was on the phone when I came in and didn't acknowledge me and there was no sign in sheet). When I finally got into the room there was some sort of white crumbs all over the exam chair that I had to brush off and the hygenist kept appologizing for things. \n\nThe filling was the worst part! She didn't use enough novocaine and it hurt so bad at one point I even yelled out! And she didn't seem concerned and kept drilling and even made a joke about it. A few hours after the appointment I noticed that she had chipped my back tooth while she was carelessly drilling away. Now I have to find a quality dentist to fix her mistake.\n\nIt was a horrible experience. I thought it would have been convenient to go during my lunch break, but I'd rather go somewhere where the dentists are knowledgable.
