Was doing some last minute Halloween shopping for my Son.  He was looking for a specific mask that all of the kids are supposedly going to wear for Halloween and this was our 2nd stop.\n\nI've never been in a Spirit Halloween Store before and I was really impressed with it.  It had a ton of Halloween related products.....costumes, decorations, table clothes, utensils, you name it!  There are a ton of cool displays too (see pics).....it gives you some ideas of how you could setup your house for Halloween.  Too late for this year, but I might do something next year.\n\nMy Son found his mask within 5 minutes...score!  Saved me a day of Halloween Store hopping and a tank of gas.\n\nRandom notes - Everything in the store will be 50% off starting Nov 1st.  The women employees here were dressed very provocatively....was beginning to think I walked into a Strip Club, wonder if it's like that at all locations or just this one?\n\nOverall Value - Great.\nWill I return?  You can count on it.
