The center bar of the Cosmopolitan Hotel! \nThis place is like hanging out in a crystal! There are chandeliers everywhere! At the main bar, it is a sort of circular bar in the center of the most massive chandelier I've ever seen. \nThere is plenty of seating at the bar, and tables for a more intimate setting. I saw that they offered bottle service, and a birthday girl was taking full advantage of it. \nThey offer video poker, with poor payouts, so I'd avoid that. \nThe drinks were crazy expensive. It came out to $90 for six drinks. Vegas expensive! \nThe bartenders were really nice, and quite personable. They hung out and chatted, and put up with our drunken antics, so I appreciated that.
