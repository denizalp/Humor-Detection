Good work but incredibly shady\/inept on their business dealings.\n\nI had a sewer leak that they diagnosed. The amount to pay was more than I had cash available, but they agreed to accept half payment immediately and take payment on the remaining in two weeks. They requested a post dated check for the remainder. \n\nThey did the work and I was happy with what they did, but then I found they had cashed both checks.  Cashed both of them when they knew I did not have the money then.\n\nI cannot tell you the bounced check fees and angry creditors I had to wade through because these idiots played fast and loose. They got their money so they were happy.\n\nDo not make payments to these people. Do not give them a post dated check. If you cannot pay these guys cash up front then go somewhere far away.
