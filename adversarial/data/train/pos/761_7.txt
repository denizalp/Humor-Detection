Trying to find a great pizza place in Vegas has proven difficult as of late.  Seems like everyone's quality is going down.  I found this place just driving by and decided to give it a shot!  Wow is all I can say.  I this was one of the best pizzas I have tasted in such a long time.  I order here about once a week and they never disappoint.  I would highly recommend.
