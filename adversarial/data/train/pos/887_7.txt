Today happens to be the first day of my Thanksgiving break, so I figured I should hit up a breakfast or lunch place that I wouldn't normally get to go to.  I read up on some of the reviews here and felt a bit unsure, as there are lots of negative ones but decided that I trust David SB, Mr. K and Pierre much more than all the naysayers.  I'm glad I did.\n\nI also, for some unexplainable reason, did not think there would be such a long wait on a random Wednesday morning.  I mean, don't people have jobs?  We ended up waiting about a half hour, which wouldn't have been bad but it also happens to be one of five days that it rains in Phoenix.  The wait was long, and both Nathan S. and I were getting close to regretting our decision.  There was great people watching though- a man running into The Coronado Hotel (that boasts an RCA electronic system and refrigeration) with a case of Natty Light, many people rushing out of Matt's to save their car from the meter police and just generally, the meter police vehicle.\n\nWe were seating and immediately served coffee which I don't usually drink.  Nathan S. assured me that this is not the kind of place with french vanilla creamer, which is sad for me, but overall a good thing and compliment to Matt's taste.\n\nI ordered the griddle cakes and a side of hash browns.  Our food arrived at different times which wasn't cool but I figure that kitchen is tiny.  It didn't take too long for his to arrive, so we just had to wait a few minutes to dig in.\n\nOne word- BUTTERTASTIC!  I am not a breakfast girl, and I attempt to eat healthy (mostly to offset the booze intake) but this was amazing.  I knew it was a very naughty breakfast, but delicious all the same.  Nathan S. also commented that the mushrooms in his omelet had definitely been marinated in butter prior to being put into the omelet, which made me like this place more.\n\nIf you are into naughty breakfasts, Matt's is your kind of place.
