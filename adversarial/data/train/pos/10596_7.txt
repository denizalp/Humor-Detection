The Buffet King says....\n\nThis is one of my trust worthy lunch spots off the strip when I'm hungry for a buffet but not wanting to pay the high prices of the strip buffets...\n\nBTW.. Not all station feast buffets are created equal..... trust me....\n\nWhy do I like this place?  Let me tell you...\n\n1)  Awesome Asian cuisine selection...   Love their Eggplants, Mabo Tofu, and most of all, Chinese BBQ pork!  (Be sure to get those ones that has a little bit of fat on it!)  So good!!! \n\n2)  Pretty tasty Italian section... meatball were my favorites and the Alfredo sauce was pretty creamy too!\n\n3)  Pretty good selections from Mexican, American, and pizzas!  But I never get to try those because I'm so addicted to the eggplants and the BBQ pork....\n\n4)  Nice salad bar!  Caesar salad here is soooo much better than souplantation's\n\n5)  Nice Dessert Section with various pies and cookies..  (And NSA choices as well)  Cold goodies are gelatos in 6-7 flavors....\n\nWeekday lunch is only $9.99.. the most expensive meal is the Friday night Seafood running at $27.99 (but as expected because it's seafood)  All other times are less than $15 bucks easy even dinner.....\n\nHere is a great tip for you all!\n\nBefore leaving...  Be sure to stop by the gelato, ask for your favorite flavor shake!  YES!! Pick your favorite gelato and the nice staff will make you a delicious ice cream shake in no time!  We love our espresso and Pistachio flavor shakes!\n\nThis is a hidden secret of sorts... but don't say I never share any goodies with you all!
