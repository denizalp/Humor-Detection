This hotel has swayed me away from the bigger hotels on the strip. It is located basically in beginning of the middle of the strip. Located just a block away from the hustle and bustle, I enjoyed that was close enough so that we can just walk to our destination without having to drive, but \"far\" enough that we didn't get the usual obnoxious drunks\/party goers. The staff is very friendly and accommodating.  My fianc√©e loved the washer\/dryer combo. We had a one bedroom villa that looked towards the strip and our villa felt like a nicely sized apartment. The bathroom was pretty big (a bit bigger than the bedroom), and the living room\/dining room area had plenty of space as well. The furnishings were updated, but still felt like a home. I enjoyed the fact that we were at the end of the hall, with a private door to access another room and ours. Our neighbors were no issue at all as we never heard them but did see them a couple of times as we left and entered our room. The valet is free and the hotel isn't too far from the airport. I will be more than happy to stay here again and maybe actually use the other amenities as we just basically slept here and didn't spend significant time on the property. I appreciate the fact that there's no casino on the premises and feels like what a hotel is supposed to feel it.
