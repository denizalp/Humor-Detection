In fairness, I gave this place five stars, but I only ever order 21.\n\nSo, 21 is as good as it gets. Curry seafood soup with vermicelli noodles? Why even look at any other item on the menu? I love this so much I go at least once a month, some months once a week. And I have had the seafood soups other establishments offer -- no where near as tasty. I have introduced this dish to many of my co-workers and now they too are addicted. Which is great because there is no MSG at this restaurant.\n\nService is prompt, staff is super friendly, location is great with ample parking.\n\nMy friend argues that the \"beef and tomato\" soup is better. You be the judge because I refuse to stray from my favorite.
