If you are in the mood for fried chicken but don't want KFC look no further!! \n\nAfter I eat KFC I honestly feel like crap but I don't feel like that after I eat here. There chicken is so good and not overly greasy! Also it's a BYOB so its awesome! I like to get a regular fried chicken and order the sauces on the side to dip. It's slightly cheaper to do so. If you like the sauces already on the chicken it becomes a bit like a general tao\n\nThe plate of fries is huge! The fries are crispy and super long and super hot! \n\nI once tried their hot & spicy chicken with cheese and I was dying! Avoid at all costs! I love spicy and I could not handle it! The waitress warned me it was very spicy and I was like yeah don't worry about it! lol \n\nI've been here a few times and I will definitely keep bringing people here. The food is good and it's fun to drink and get your hands dirty!
