This place is a dive, and it's dank, and it's dark, and I don't care.  It's called The Reef and I'm glad they changed the name because \"Draft House\" would imply that they had a great selection of draft beers (they don't).\n\nAll of that, and still 4 stars?  Well you see, their wings are stellar.  This isn't a recommendation from some schlub who thinks all wings are just the best...you all know that guy....he eats a dozen wings that look cold and slimy and says \"They're not bad!\".  No, I'm a wing connoisseur, having traveled far and wide to find the best wings in the city, and I can safely say these are Top 3 Wings.\n\nBetter than Native's mediocre dreck.  Better than Buffalo Wild Wing's garbage.  Better than most of your sports bars that have won awards (looking at you, Half Moon).  Better than ATL Wings across the street? ....ehhhh probably not.  But still, stellar, big, well-cooked wings with a GREAT hot sauce.  And try the Donkey Sauce, it'll kick the shit out of you.
