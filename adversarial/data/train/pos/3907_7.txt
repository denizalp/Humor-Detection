Disappointing. Based on the crowds I've seen at this place during the weekend I imagined it would be a good spot for pizza, not the case. \n\n Clearly the folks in the area don't know what good pizza is and neither does Brixx. We went during the week so it was pretty empty, so it was very puzzling as to why the service sucked so much. Our server Devin was clearly distracted and not very attentive. She was not helpful and seemed to have a lot on her mind. The manager however was very nice and seemed to be more concerned with her table as he asked us a couple of times how we were doing. \n \nOur server never asked us how our meal was nor did she come by for refills. She also added a free appetizer to the bill which she had to correct. I ALWAYS order dessert when we go out, except when the server brings the bill without giving me the option of dessert. \n\nAfter paying the bill, I asked Devin for a coke to go and she seemed bothered, she returned a few minutes later and slid the coke onto the table which was very unprofessional. \n\n Based on the service I won't return. It also doesn't help that the food is subpar. I wouldn't recommend.
