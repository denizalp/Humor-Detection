This is a small (34 rooms) boutique hotel located between Phoenix and Scottsdale. If you're visiting you will find this to be a perfect location to take in all there is to do in the area.  \n\nThis is an old hotel - well, old by Southwest standards. It was built in the 1930s and has been impeccably maintained but fortunately modern conveniences have been added. They have a variety of room choices in adobe haciendas that are surrounded by beautiful gardens. Perfect for tourists or just a romantic weekend getaway.\n\nAs you'd expect from a hotel like this, the staff is friendly and attentive.  In addition to well appointed rooms the Inn also features a fantastic restaurant (Lon's) and a cozy bar (Last Drop).\n\nI always recommend this hotel to friends\/family who are visiting and I've taken advantage of their local specials as well.
