I bet you didn't know that this is the only - got that? - the ONLY location of Spoon Me in all of Canada. Of all the cities in our country, Spoon Me graces Calgary, Alberta with its presence, and I for one am eternally grateful. \n\nSpoon Me is a frozen yogurt franchise in the States and what I love most about it is its threefold mission. Spoon Me believes that we all should care for the body we live in, the people we live with and the earth we live on, and they accomplish this by doing the following: \n\n#1 - Spoon Me is a green company in that everything customers use in Spoon Me stores is biodegradable - including the spoons which are made of cornstarch. \n\n#2 - Spoon Me frozen yogurt is made from natural ingredients and comes in at only 83 calories per serving, is fat free and contains no table sugar or artificial sweeteners. \n\n#3 - Instead of accepting tips, Spoon Me stores accept donations to a new local charity each month with it's 'Keep The Change' charity program. \n\nWith all this aside, and my God it's A LOT, Spoon Me serves DELICIOUS frozen yogurt, has sensational customer service, and is located perfectly right in the heart of Kensington. \n\nSo allow me to summarize: \nSpoon me is good to the environment, good to our community, good to our bodies, tastes great, has exceptional service and it's only location in ALL of Canada is right here in our city. \n\nSo I'm assuming you're on your way? Yeah, thought so.
