We celebrate a lot of special occasions at Michael's Back Door.  Not only is the food fantastic, but the service is wonderful.  We took advantage of the Taste of Clarkson special which offered an appetizer, entr√©e and dessert for $25.  \n\nI started with a zucchini and tomato salad.  The portion was larger than expected and presented beautifully.  Other members of my party enjoyed the Caesar salad and the butternut squash soup.  I've had the Caesar before and it's easily one of the best I've had.  Those who enjoyed the soup couldn't stop raving about it and the portion was gigantic for a soup.  After hearing our comments, the waiter told us about a group of guys who come for lunch.  They have such big appetites that they serve them 32 ounces of soup!\n\nI chose the veal for my main course.  Again, the portion was very generous.  It was well-prepared (not overcooked) and topped with melted cheese over zucchini and eggplant.  Delicious!\n\nDessert was a fruity sherbet with pineapple.  Nothing special, but very refreshing after a big meal.\n\nMy only complaints are that they never seem to have the wine we want to order and the service can be slow at times.  To be fair to Michael's, they have always made a good wine suggestion for us and we were a large party.  \n\nMichael's is on the pricy side, but well worth it.  Try to take advantage of their specials, like the Taste of Clarkson!\n\nAlso - I highly recommend the angelhair pasta with lobster sauce.  Huge portion and absolutely delicious!
