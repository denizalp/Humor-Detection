Ordered via JustEat.ca...\n\nFood came two hours later. Food was lukewarm and dry.  Food is now sitting in my fridge while I think of what to do with it.\n\nPossible options: \n1)eat it\n2)toss it out window\n3)toss it into air dramatically\n\nI'll probably go with option 1 because I'm always hungry, but I will not be ordering from this place again.
