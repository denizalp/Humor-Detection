Still in my opinion, one of the best buffets in Las Vegas and indeed a great bargain.  There is just too much to choose from here and I end up feeling extremely gluttonous after leaving.   It's a bit off the strip on Tropicana but it's a pretty cool buffet and their salad bar is quite impressive.  Their cheesecake was also pretty good as well.  I've paid the same price for simply one slice of cheesecake in NYC as their entire buffet costs.  Highly recommended, yet again!
