Firstly, I'm not a vegetarian. I'm also not a vegan. I do tend to eat a mediteranean diet but I don't deprive myself of anything I might be in the mood for. \n\nYet when I read the reviews on this place I thought I had to try it. We came with low expectations, after all - how can one fill up on greens and grains most of which are raw with no meat whatsover?\n\nWell we were pleasantly surprised. The meals are 1\/2 \"living art\" that just happens to be edible. Delicately diagonally cut cucumber slices \"dipped\" in blackened, toasted sesame seeds as garnish along with micro greens and sprouts. \n\nBut the sauces were SUPERB! We're going back again just to experience what eating fresh is like. \n\nFor someone that grows his own organic vegetables, I very appreciated how hard it is to have all these greens fresh each day. \n\nThis place is so fresh next time I will have to bring a wooden spoon just for spanking.
