I secretly love Chili's.  There, I said it.  I'm not proud.  It's an obnoxious chain, but it's the obnoxious chain I default to when my friends want to go to a chain restaurant.  And okay, the Southwestern Eggrolls are delicious.  I've been to this location many times, and I've always gotten pretty good service.  This is a reliable stop if you're out on Prospect and need something quick and relatively inexpensive.
