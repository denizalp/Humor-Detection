I can't find a contact email otherwise I would have contacted them directly and given them a chance to respond\/correct. Alas, here I am on Yelp.\n\nThe food was delicious (The pollo Rico is in fact very rico). My seasonal marg was as strong as a cross fit-er.\n\nI just have one major complaint. Our party of 5 was seated at a long booth. They repeatedly passed things from behind me over the back of the booth. It was the weirdest thing. All of a sudden, there would be an iced tea by my ear. I don't care if it's convenient for the server team, it was jarring and odd.
