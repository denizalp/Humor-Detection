Went for my birthday dinner. Service was beyond 5 stars. Loved all the little touches from the amuse bouche to the shot of gazpacho to the cotton candy and take home treat. I'm not a drinker but they have an impressive cocktail menu. Since it was my birthday I caved and had a glass of wine, which was fab. But the the main meal just did not blow us away as expected - lobster roll and the steak dish. Loved the sauces on the steak dish though, especially the cauliflower. The chocolate mint dessert was a letdown. Although I love candied lime peel I wasn't feeling it in this dish. I really think this is a case of ordering the \"wrong\" things. My gut told me to get the scallops and I regret not going with it. This is a rare case where even though my first impression was not the best, the service and overall experience will be enough to get me back to try something else.
