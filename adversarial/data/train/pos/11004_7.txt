It's whatevz. We got in with no wait, for free, and got multiple free drink tickets each. Free henny & coke without having to hustle, HOLLA! Haha. The venue was cute, but nothing amazing. The only thing that stood out was the music... which is, in my opinion, the best music in any Vegas nightclub... \n\nBUT even with all of that said, I'd still only give it two stars. The crowd was a bunch of broke ass CREEPY college kids. If I knew it was gonna be like that, I would've just went clubbing near UC Irvine. It definitely did not live up to my Vegas-good-time standards!
