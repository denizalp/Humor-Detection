This shopping mall is in my neighborhood and is my mall of choice. There are a few shops and a restaurant space available for lease right now. There are 3 major department stores in this mall and a pretty decent food court which has a Chic-fil-a, Habanero's Mexican Grill, Subway, and more. The mall is reasonably maintained. The restroom needed a little attention. The security will meet anyone who is handicapped at the main entrance with a wheelchair free of charge to use in the mall. There is an elevator to make this mall 100% handicapped accessible. It is nice to come here on a 110+ degree day and browse the stores in a climate controlled environment.
