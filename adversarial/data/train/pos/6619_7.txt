Thank goodness for this pit stop before entering Las \nVegas as we were driving back from St George, Utah where we had Chick-Fil-A. I had a sudden urge & need to have to use the restroom facilities. Boy did I luck out in time. There were four in the ladies restroom but there was a wait. On top of all that I had to go back again. Sorry for the TMI!\n\nAnyway, the travel stop itself was good sized that you can order pizza or sandwiches plus they carry a lot of souvenir stuff and lots of snacks!!! I did like that as I'm a sucker for snacks and cute plushes!\n\nStop here if you need to; you'll be glad you did!
