Spent a few hours here today (Thursday 11\/6).  Nice drive up to the summit, with a few stops here and there hoping to find some trails.  I knew there were many, but I only stumbled on a handful.  This public park is supposedly the largest in the world, yet it can't afford to mark its trailheads?  I was expecting to find trailhead signs just like those I encountered at the Grand Canyon, but no.  Just have to stumble upon them somehow.  \n\n\nDrives up and down were cool, if a little hairy- my brain kept stimulating my vagal nerves to fire signals up and down the backs of my glutes and leg muscles.  Normally, these are unwelcome sensations, but they actually kept me from feeling some of the discomfort caused by lunch (cross-reference Gallagher's)!  LOL.  \n\nI'll be back very soon.  Would be nice to visit in the spring and see some wildflowers along with the cacti.
