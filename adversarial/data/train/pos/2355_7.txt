Stu Millers provided me with great memories of my children gleefully playing. \nThey sell tickets for a dollar or a pack of twenty for nineteen dollars. Save a buck.\nActivities cost one or more tickets. Easy enough.\n\nSome of the pumpkins must have been organic because they were GINORMOUS. \n\nMy kids loved every minute. And so did Mom and Dad.
