came in for dinner one night and sat at the bar... super low lighting... both bartenders were very friendly and made good beer recommendations.... they were, in my opinion, pushing everything on the menu like it was the best thing on earth..... didnt mention the specials till i over heard a waitress talking about them... then he had to ask the other bartender what they were...\n\nI ordered the terrayki top sirloin steak special with garlic mashed potatoes... Steak wasnt that good at all but it was cooked to a good medium like i asked. That doesnt earn them any more stars though... mashed potatoes were ok.... \n\nBest thing about this place was the beer and thats not even gonna get them an extra star because they sell those beers everywhere in AZ..... \n\nwont be coming back here either!
