After passing by this spot numerous times while getting a Fat Tuesday, I finally gave it a shot. \n\nI ordered the Connecticut. Total came to nearly $18! (But then again it's Vegas) For that price my expectations were somewhat high.\n\nI encountered a pretty long waiting time for ordering and getting my food. The roll was really good! Not salty and doused in butter like I expected and the toasted bread was perfect. The size disappointed me, wasn't even the size of a 6 inch subway sandwich.\n\nWorth my money? \n\nNot quite. Not enough to fill you up, not mouth-watering enough to make you feel like your money was worth it. With Earl of Sandwich just around the corner I'd rather go there and get an entire meal for less than one sandwich at this spot.\n\nDefinitely not a bang for buck spot but if money is not an issue I would come back. \nIf I do come back I want to try the Mac N Cheese and lobster on a stick.
