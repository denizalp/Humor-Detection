This is a amazing steakhouse located inside of the New York New York casino on the corner of Las Vegas blvd and Tropicana.  Now that the T-Mobile arena is conveniently located right now the to this casino...I find myself here a lot more than what I used to be.  \n\nWhen I go to Golden Knights games or a couple shows I find myself here for dinner and it's great.  \n\nThe have a great selection of meats and sides. They also have great prices and impeccable customer service.  \n\nI highly recommended the bone-in ribeye and the prime rib.
