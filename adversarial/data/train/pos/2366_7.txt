I don't know why it's taken me so long to write this review. I guess it's hard to have a good, well rounded picture of a place when you don't stray very far from your usual dish. I always order pho tai and add lots and lots of Thai basil and chile paste and oil. Mmhmm! Now I know I'm Mexican, and my go to hangover cure should be menudo, but... Man pho is just as good if not better. And I love that this place opens at 8am! Not that I'd ever be up that early with a hangover. But I'm a sucker for a warm bowl of steamy noodles anytime, and even more so when I feel like ass.\n\nThis particular bowl of pho is very consistent. The only thing I don't like about this place is that the service hasn't always been the best, and the place feels dirty on a regular basis. I do love that this place is a really inexpensive bowl of pho. In times when I am not at my richest I can grab a bowl of pho and be full the entire day. That's the best. The child really likes the bahn mi here as well so that is a bonus.
