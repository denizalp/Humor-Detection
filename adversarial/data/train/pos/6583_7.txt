I wanted to find a tasty little homemade style Mexican spot and I think I found my place! \n\nMy MIL and I tried this place on a random whim and it's quickly become one of our spots. \n\nShe always gets enchiladas with green sauce vs the regular red enchilada. Its her go- to at Mexican spots, and they make it well here. I like to try different things though. I've had enchiladas as well (with shrimp or chicken for me) and like their green sauce too. I've gotten the carnitas if you like a meaty big chunk version of this. Ceviche tostada is piled high for the $3.50 with fish and shrimp and really citrusy, but get some hot sauce from the salsa bar and it's good (get it with mayo spread on the tostada). I think so far my favorite item is the birria. It took a while to find some place that makes this fork tender. It is super good. \n\nThe salsa bar has 5 different sauces, carrot and chiles, this awesome pickled cabbage, white beans. The salsas lean a bit more spicy than the average place, which makes me happy! You get some chips when you sit down. Then prepare for food that someone would make you at home. Everything here is definitely homemade and not phoned in. \n\nThey are super friendly here as well. \n\nIm a fan, I think I will go try to eat through the menu as my MIL has been asking for the enchiladas often.
