Gas station mother F'in tacos!!!!!!  This please is legit.  We started coming here the first day it opened and went on a taco binge for 3 months straight. Authentic Mexican at a low price right next a business park.  Unfortunately they have blown up and I have to call 2 hours early now to get my tacos.  \n\nTheir steak tacos and the al pastor are out of control good.  Also, the shrimp quesadilla is filled to the brim with those crustaceans.  The only disappointing thing is you get lees chips than you used to.  I still love you Domingo, tacos are fire!
