+1 Green chile everywhere, on everything!\n+1 Menu has Frito Pie and Indian Fry Bread\n+1 Sunday special is BOGO breakfast burritos\n+1 they serve beer and margaritas too\n\nThis place deserves a second location, it's that good... and that busy! The food is stick-to-your-ribs good, so definitely come on a cheat day. There's cheese on everything, and gigantic portions, so you're not getting out of here under a thousand calories.\n\nMenu has a good amount of variety but my favorite is the stuffed sopapilla (pork verde please!) topped with the green chile. The Santa Fe Slider is a fairly unique offering, consisting of a slider-size burger patty folded into a tortilla and topped with green chile relish, spicy mayo, and cheese.
