Pro's:\n\nInexpensive:\nWe stayed on a weekend (Check in Friday\/Check Out Monday) and paid $248 for an upgraded room.  I think the person just gave us the upgrade, but anyway $248 is a freakin' steal! When you are in Vegas all you do in the room is get ready, pregame, and get some ;) so why would I spend nearly $300 more to stay at the Mirage, Bally's, Paris, or even more at any of the mid-strip hotels?  There is always the option of Imperial Palace, but have you seen and smelled that place?  Since our room was in the updated Tower II, the rooms were very nice for the price, modern furniture, 42\" flat screen TV, full-length mirror.  What more do you need people, it's Vegas?! \n\nFood Selection:\nThey have a good variety of food in their food court pizza, burgers, Asian inspired Sandwiches and snacks (pretzels & popcorn).  I am not a buffet person and struggle finishing a regular plate of food in two settings sometimes so I am not going to waste $25 on one meal unless it's gourmet.\n\nLocation:\nThey are located in an easy to access spot where there are hotels (New York New York, Tropicana, MGM) surrounding and connected by a bridge.  In addition, the Luxor is connected by a corridor with an automated walkway.  They also have easy access to the Luxor and Mandalay Bay using their free tram.\n\nCon's\n\nTimeshare Sales people:\nOk, so I will admit the people trying to sell you timeshares are annoying as hell and they partially suck me in every time until Jon snaps me back into reality.  I WILL NEVER do a timeshare meeting in Vegas again. The last time we did the presentation we actually got a free stay for going, now it seems as if all they give is a show ticket.  Sorry, my time is more valuable than that. Stay away from these people they are sneaky and try to suck you in.\n\nAmbiance:\nAmbiance is lacking...corny, touristy, and many things are outdated.\n\nBUT SERIOUSLY THOUGH, when it comes down to it sure it's older and smells like smoke, but we're in Vegas and since people can smoke indoors that's just how it is.  I am glad I don't always follow the advice of all the reviews prior to staying somewhere because many of the previous reviews would have detoured me from staying here and I definitely enjoyed my $250 stay.  Sometimes you just have to take things on a case-by-case basis and see what works best for you and your budget.
