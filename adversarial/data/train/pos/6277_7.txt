This is why I love Yelp - I would have never encountered Vines & Hops without it! This cozy wine\/beer bar is tucked in a quiet side street in Old Town Scottsdale. I came with a friend around 930 on a Saturday night. We were quickly greeted with one of their tablet menus, which was a fun technological twist! The wine and beer lists were extensive, with plenty of local Arizona choices as well as other locations. \n\nWe both chose the Arizona wine flight - three, 3oz pours of your choice of any Arizona based wines. Our favorite was actually the Vines & Hops House Sauvignon blanc! \n\nThe service was great. We were checked up on often and our empty wine flight glasses were picked up within minutes of finishing. \n\nWhile we didn't try any food on this visit, the menu looked delicious! I will definitely be back soon to partake in a panini or charcuterie board.
