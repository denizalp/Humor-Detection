Everyone has already said it all.  Solid but unmemorable diner food, in a place that is divinely Vegas.\n\nIt's a must-see.  Ambience is 6 stars.\n\nThe rest doesn't matter much.  It's edible.  You won't get food poisoning.  Good drunk food alternative to Denny's.  Worth the trip even if it's out of the way.
