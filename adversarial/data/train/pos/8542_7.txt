Mixed feelings with this company.  They did a good job replacing cheap plastic shut off valves on our sinks, but then things took a turn.  While replacing one under our kitchen sink they said our garbage disposal was cracked, but not leaking.  Okay, that is a common issue, so we asked for a quote.  This is when I almost fell off my chair.  $850.  Yes - $ 8 - 5 - 0.  Whoa!!!  Is that thing gold plated??  I immediately hit up google and could only find food service disposals at that price.  The kind you put in restaurants.   The highest rated on Amazon were half that price.  I understand the specs when it comes to noise and horsepower, but we don't need to launch our sink into space.  We declined this particular service.
