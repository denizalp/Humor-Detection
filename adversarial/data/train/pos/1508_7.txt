New management. Went there this week. Food is much better. Staff is friendly..We tried a kabab and chicken curries.. Very nice.. Naan could be better but tasted very fresh.. they were becoming hard quicker.. may be becoz winter?? Curries tasted very nice. I hope this one stays.. Last few ownerships have changed some werent so good..
