3.5 stars for the Pateis de Nata ... I know its Portuguese Custard Tarts but guess what, the Brazilians did a pretty good job.  I've been trying all the Portuguese Custard Tarts in the area and my current reigning favourite is Venezia with Novita, Caldense, and Nova Era all serving up decent versions.  \n\nBrazil Bakery is a large cafe with a take out bakery on the East side with the west side having all the tables and seating.  There is a lot of space so you're never feeling crowded and there windows do offer a lot of natural light in so it's not too dark and cave like.  The bakery does feel a bit dated but in a good way.  It's like time stood still when everyone would come in for their coffee and pateis de nata first thing in the morning before heading into Toronto or on Sundays after church.\n\nThe bakery offers a lot of breads and they're all baked in house.  Lots of loaves or buns to choose from the many many racks.  They also have lots of cakes pre made for you or the many sweets ... there is a mountain of cakes, tarts, and cookie types.  \n\nPateis de Nata - For only $2.80, you get 2 freshly made custard tarts.  That's right... for less then a cup of coffee at a good spot, you get 2 of these!  It's a complete steal especially when across the street you have to pay $5.50 for 1 tart.  Anyhow, these are quite nice... crispy crust that flakes and shatters when you bite into it.  An oozy centre that is more like a molten cake than any firm eggy custard.  It was a novel approach and i do like it.  As for flavour, I found the custard to be sweeter than Venezia and more generically one note (just sweet).  I didnt taste any egg or vanilla.  Still a great pateis de nata!  3.5\/5\n\nDefinitely come for the super affordable and well made tarts... grab a large loaf while your'e add it.  I saw they do make fresh donuts but they werent there during the week day.  You'll be served quickly and be enjoying your custards with a few pieces of change in your pocket.
