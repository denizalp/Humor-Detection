I love a good Yelp check-in special when I see one! :D \n\nI literally dragged my wife into a 9 mile roundtrip walk to the MGM from The Mirage this weekend just so i can get their $9 frozen margarita special! And since it was only 106 degrees outside, it was the PERFECT thing to cool me down once we arrived! \n\nI wish I was actually hungry to want to try their food because it actually looked really good... however, I'll definitely have to save it for the next time we're back.
