My wife and I had an appt at 2pm & 245pm today. We have been waiting for like 6 weeks to get in...I show up 10 minutes before 2pm and they tell me we dont have an appt because we didnt have our paperwork done or responded to their text messages. Yes, we didnt have the paperwork done because we figured we would do it there just like any other clinic or dental office. They never texted us at all...so how can I respond to a text message when we never receive one. Will not go back with these asinine policies in place!
