I felt like a total traitor coming here due to my love affair with Lifetime Fitness. However, my friend needed to work out and this was closer. \n\nFirst off, compared to Lifetime this place is crap. It's hideous purple color and these \"no judgement\" signs are bull.\n\nNow putting my snobbish Lifetime sensibilities behind me I actually enjoyed this gym.\n\nEverything was super clean, from the machines to the bathrooms. And that's difficult to accomplish when everyone is sweaty and needing to poop after a good workout.\n\nI also like the wall of keys, I have forgotten my keys so many times at the gym that I can really appreciate a wall to store keys while working out.\n\nAnd I love their little \"quick 30 minute workout\" area. It is a totally genius idea and I adored every minute of it.\n\nHowever I've been spoiled by the endless supply of clean towels at Lifetime and at Planet fitness they give you cheap brown paper towels and spray bottles instead. Such a cop out.\n\nSo I would come back for sure, I might even jump ship because it's cheaper and more convenient - only if they replace the crappy paper towels with some real towels!
