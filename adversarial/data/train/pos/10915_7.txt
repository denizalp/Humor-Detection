When our food arrived before our 4 beers, some 15 minutes after first taking our seat, we knew to readjust our expectations for Pork and Beans.  Our friendly but absent waitress offered no explanation for the slow drinks and thought we would be delighted with how quickly the food was presented.  \n\nMuch has been said about the terrible seating arrangements so I'll skip that critique and focus more on the one thing that can save an otherwise poor restaurant: the food. We ordered 4 meats and 2 sides after being steered away from going the sandwich route by our server.  \n\nThe broccoli slaw was excellent. The fries were strictly average.  The sandwich rolls they brought out with our family-style platter were still connected, obviously right out of a bag and not homemade. We were given 4.  \n\nAnd, BOY, what a sad little platter of meat.  When I saw how paltry my \"half pound\" of brisket was I assumed I was in for a real treat, some truly extraordinary smoked meat.  What I tasted barely passed for BBQ. \n\nThe meat breakdown:\n\nBrisket: adequate tenderness but with a huge ribbon of fat. NO SMOKE flavor. \n\nPulled pork: heavily brined, NO SMOKE. Extremely over-cooked and had the consistency of meat paste. Nearly inedible. \n\nRibs: tasted exactly the same as the brisket. No unique flavor and again NO SMOKE. \n\nChicken wasn't bad at all. But nothing special.  \n\nSauces: extremely poor, ranging from the too-vinegar-y \"hot\" to the absolutely terrible \"classic\" that tastes not unlike the stuff you get in the packet at Chil Fil A.  They need to source this stuff from people who know how to make sauces until they can figure it out.  \n\nThe prices and portion sizes are criminal. $46 for 2 beers, slaw, and brisket!\n\nIf you have any exposure to good BBQ from places like Texas, Carolinas, Memphis, or my hometown of KC you are not going to be happy with your food.  Throw in bad service, bad seating, and a slow bar.  This place won't make it another year once word of mouth spreads.
