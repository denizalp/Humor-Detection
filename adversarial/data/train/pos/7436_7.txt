This place is really great!  I had gotten lazy about getting a quality haircut here in Las Vegas;  I had condemned myself to an endless series of Supercuts that left me looking like a six-year-old.   On the outs with fashion.  \n\nThanks to American Male, I'm back in! (I hope!)  After a quality haircut, massage and even this odd thing where they dipped my hands in birthday cake-scented candle wax and put them in mitts, I felt relaxed and stress-free.   It was pricy, but I'll think of it as a once-every-six-weeks day to unwind and get refreshed for an hour.  \n\nThanks for restoring my faith in me ever having a decent haircut again!  Also, thank you for making my hands smell like cake possibly forever.
