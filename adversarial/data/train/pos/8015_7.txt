Once upon a time, there was this hot new ticket in town. Charcut. My first visit was in December of 2010. Then in January of 2011, there was this explosion of something called an Alley Burger. We lined up by Charcut's back kitchen door for $5 burgers. The beginnings of true \"gourmet street food.\" Quite literally. After Alley Burger came Chef Connie's appearance on Top Chef Canada last year, and my share of Mondays at Charcut watching the TV and then watching the rest of the crowd as they'd swivel their necks towards the open kitchen and crane to see what Connie's reaction was in person whenever something happened regarding her on the show. \n\nAnd now, well, Charcut is just awesome food, plain and simple. The must tries, in this order: any of the desserts in a jar, Charcut board (make sure the mortadella's on there), poutine, heirloom beets, raclette, bone marrow, asparagus salad honey something carrots. I'm sure I'd tell you to eat the entrees too if I'd gotten that far... but I haven't yet. Too many things to keep sharing with my friends. That time will come though, I'm sure.\n\nNuff said? I don't think so. Two cocktails you've got to go try are the clarified caesar (please make sure you eat the bacon that comes in the drink) and the dark and stormy. \n\nIt's one thing to hear and to read that Charcut is one of the top restaurants in the city. It's quite another to have experienced it first hand and put your own name behind that kind of statement. But Connie and John have created such a great place! And I can take\/suggest it to just about anyone... hanging out with friends, out on a date, family's in town and they need a good place to eat... and to top it all off, everyone's just so gosh-darned NICE! \n\nThe next time I'm wearing a hat, I shall stop in for a hats off salute, Connie and John!
