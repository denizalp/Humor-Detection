Have you been to 5 guys before? No? Well you're probably going to need 5 guys with you to eat all the food you're about to order that you think you can eat yourself.\n\nSure you walk up to the register and place your order for a cheeseburger, fries and a coke. What would be any different than any other fast food place? Yeah the prices are a little higher but it's because of the better ingredients they put in right? Sure.\n\nWhether you are eating in or getting your meal to go you are going to get it in a paper bag. This is so that they can bag your order and then dump a crap load of fries on top. That large fry you just ordered because you were a little extra hungry just turned into an extra medium fry. \n\nIf you're the average person you're going to want to order a little burger. It's too bad they don't offer a small fry because the regular fry is too much for one person to eat on their own. The toppings here are great and they have a lot of choice.\n\nExpect to wait a little while for your meal. They're busy and it's going to take some time.
