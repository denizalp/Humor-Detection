Is this the best Italian Deli \/ Bakery that I've ever been to? No. Is this the best one in the Valley area? Absofrigginlutely!!! \n\nThis is the ONLY place that I know of in this metro area that you can select from eight varieties\/brands of San Marzano Tomatoes. If you have to ask why that is significant enough to merit 5 stars... then I can only imagine that you haven't spent decades attempting to perfect your Pomodoro or Pizza Sauce. \n\nCombine this with the fact that they almost always have Rainbow cookies available and some of the best fresh Italian breads, and you have achieved two-thirds of an almost idyllic Italian meal. \n\nBefore you leave the store, make sure you take a leisurely stroll along the back wall. This is what I like to consider a little piece of heaven on earth. Every imaginable cheese \/ meat you've ever heard uttered by the Mario's, Lydia's, and Giada's of this world can be found in the case that runs the entire length of the store. Want to create an out of this world antipasto selection for your next get together? Seriously if you can't find it in that case, you are trying to live up to Captain Jack Harkness standards, and although I adore him... he is a work of fiction! \n\nAnd I have to agree with Nathan; they make one hell of a sandwich, but I've never sampled any of their other eat in\/take out items, so my input is limited on that side of the house. \n\nThis is not a \"pretty\" place. It's not trendy or new and it is located in yet another strip mall. But it is a fully functional, family run, local business that is operated by two of the nicest guys you would ever want to meet. As far as quality and friendliness goes, this place rocks! I discovered Romanelli's about 25 years ago (remember... it's not polite to ask a girl's age) and let's just say, they had me at ciao. : )
