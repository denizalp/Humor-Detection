DO NOT BUY A CAR FROM THIS PLACE! Deceitful, dishonest, and horrible to work with. \n\nNot only did they sell my mother a vehicle that had major issues, but they then supposedly fixed the issues and charged my mother for them (and we took it to another mechanic who said they didn't really do the work they said they had done!!) My mother is the sweetest woman alive, and she works very hard for her money (as we all do), and this place sold her a vehicle that had issues after the first day. They said they would take care of the issues, but they did not hold true to their word. She bought a car back in February and they told her the car needed a wheel bearing and a few small engine repairs. They said they'd fix it in 3 days and to bring the car back then. The car had a two week warranty. She brought the car back in 3 days as told and waited in their office while they supposedly repaired the car. They came out after about an hour and said the wheel bearing had been fixed but that the car needed a new catalytic converter. The car blew a head gasket and she had the car towed back to them. They quoted her a price to fix it IN WRITING and then increased the rate a few hours later.  She decided to have it towed to another place and they fixed the head gasket and also the water pump. This new mechanic told her the car needed a wheel bearing and we were shocked. They never fixed the wheel bearing even though they charged her for it! We then called Velocity and told them that the wheel bearing was NOT fixed like they had said. They rambled off that my mother should be grateful that she got a car so inexpensive and that they weren't going to fix it. So we spent another $300 to fix an issue that they had supposedly already fixed. We also found out the car needs front struts, and all engine mounts. These people are deceitful and have absolutely no integrity. Her $2500 \"great  buy\" ended up being a $5500 piece of junk.
