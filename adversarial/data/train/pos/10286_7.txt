Went here with fellow yelpers Fung and Jaime. \n\nAnd it was probably the more decent dim sum in Cleveland.\n\nFirst, the restaurant is quite gorgeous. The first restaurant open in the \"new\" Chinatown, it's quite pretty- gold and red all over the restaurant and it's brand new.\n\nThe dim sum was order only though- although it was fresh, I still prefer my carts, so I know what I'm ordered. I would definitely recommend the siu mai and the ha gao, and even the chicken feet. The sticky rice with preserved meats were okay, and the cheong fun..was not that good. (the noodle was too thick).\n\nComing from a Canto viewpoint, I must say it's the better of the dim sum places. My lunchmates did not agree...but honestly, I think it was the best in Cleveland. Did I like it? meh...I woudl go again though....but all I know is that it beats Li Wah, that's for sure.....
