Tucked away in Paradise Valley, this boutique hotel is truly amazing.  I came here to visit friends and have dinner @ Elements.  The view of Paradise Valley is awesome.  It's so quiet here at night that you forget that you're in the Phoenix Metro area.....it truly lives up to it's name.\n\nThe rooms are awesome and have patios that open up and face the pool area.  We hung out there for hours relaxing and enjoying the atmosphere.   Sometimes just doing nothing in peace & quiet is enough to recharge your batteries.\n\nI will definitely come back.\n\nReturn Factor - 100%
