Just came back with a Supreme(?) pizza from here. I ate one slice and so did my friend. We threw the rest away. I can't believe all the 4 and 5 star reviews!! The onions were edible but the rest of the ingredients were so sub par I don't want to use the correct description. Sauce-lousy, pepperoni-tasteless,cheese-blah,sausage-forgetabout it. Just terribly bad all around. This is not like any other \"back east\" pizza I've ever had. I grew up in So.New England and know good New Haven and New York style pizza. There are too many good pizza places in Vegas now so I can't think of one good reason to ever go back. I'm going to go chew on my socks to get the taste out of my mouth.
