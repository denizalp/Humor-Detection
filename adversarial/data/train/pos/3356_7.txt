I came here to replace a toy that had recently stopped working. Location played a big part in why I came to this spot. I was greeted when I first entered, but was not approached again during my time in the store. Maybe this is their policy--to not hover like car salesman and give the customers a bit of privacy.. The store is divided with one side being clothes,shoes, and costumes. The other side has toys, DVDs, a small bachelorette display. This store definitely lacked the novelty section that I have seen in other places. The check out line was 3 people deep and it took almost 10 minutes to make my way to the register. I don't like the policy that each toy must be opened and turned on before the sale can be made. I just find it a bit gross for someone else to be handling my toy. Yes, I know it didn't get made and packaged by magic, but it kind of ruined the novelty of it by seeing to two women manhandled my toy before I even had a chance to.
