This place is too loud.  It would have been nice to have a meal without some lady yelling 'meatlog' across the room.  Also the waitstaff was somewhat incompetent and snobby.  The food was delicious but it's not something anyone can make themselves at home.  They are stingy with their bread even though it is now free. Lots of annoying things that will probably persuade me not to come back.
