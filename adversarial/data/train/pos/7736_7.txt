Whatchu need?! I'm trying my hand at making some Taiwanese Popcorn Chicken and I need supplies! \nI found everything I needed here despite the fact that when I asked the staff only half of them could understand me. \nThere is also a small eatery inside to get some haaaawt food and there is another little store inside with all the Hello Kitty gear your heart desires!
