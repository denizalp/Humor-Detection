There are plenty of people who lack appreciation for the finer things in life, as demonstrated by finding a restaurant like Mildred's Temple Kitchen with a 3.5 out of 5 star rating (as of this writing).  You know, they're the kind of dimwits who complain about the speed of service when they're at a relaxing & elegant restaurant.\n\nMildred's menu isn't the biggest or broadest, but what they make tastes amazing.\n\nTheir portions are far from big - at first glance I thought some were small - however, the quantities are perfectly satisfying for someone who's not an overweight glutton.\n\nA true gourmet burger can be found at Mildred's, and it should be the benchmark for all competing gourmet burgers.\n\nPeople who don't love Mildred's are probably better off eating at Harvey's or McDonalds...\n\nSorry if I come off arrogant or condescending, but some of the reviewers here need to get a clue.  I may write more later, as I love Mildred's Temple Kitchen and go there periodically.  It's one of my favourite places to take visitors.
