APPLEBEE'S HAS RATS!!!\n\nI was trying to enjoy a celebratory dinner with my Son, grand kids & my ex-wife bit couldn't even do that! my order was wrong! I SPECIFICALLY asked for no onions on my bourbon steak & the waitress kept arguing back n' forth with me that I didnt!\n\n& thats when I went to dig in to my Cobb Salad & found a WHOLE RAT in my salad!\nFeces & everything! No wonder the damn Ninja Turtles couldn't find Master Splinter.. \n\nStay far away from this or any Applebee's as they certainly aren't up to food standards
