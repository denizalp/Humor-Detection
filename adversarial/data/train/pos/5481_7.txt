I finally made it out here today and I absolutely loved it.  The place was packed!!  O my goodness loads of people!!  The place is huge, with an enormous amount of signage and colorful d√©cor.  Ton's of tables, and lots of people helping.  The lines here were long, but I didn't spend more then 15 minutes between the time I stood in line and got my food.\n\nthey have two lines here. One for ordering, one for food pickup.  They had all 4 registers open, with girls throughout the line taking your order and writing it down for you to make things go quicker.  Once I got to the register, things went fine.  They sent me over to the pickup line where you grab your drinks and food.  That was the longer line of the two, and you kind of stand around in this clustered area waiting for your number to be called.  Being that this place was packed, there was an enormous amount of people waiting, but it seemed to go by quickly.\n\nI found a seat near the door, and the food was awesome!  I got the jumbo hot dog with relish, mustard and onions with a pickle on the side. Bun was tasty, and I loved it. Price point was right on, and I will gladly drive the few extra miles to go here in the future.  If you haven't gone to Portillo's, you must do so!! Tasty!!\n\nThey also have a drive thru here, so if you want to avoid the crowds, or are in a hurry, this is the way to go.  Outdoor seating is available, along with ample parking in a very busy shopping center. Place is visible from the road, but come early because the place is non stop busy!!
