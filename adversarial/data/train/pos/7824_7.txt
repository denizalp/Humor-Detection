Will not be purchasing a car from here. The sale reps are racists and I do not condone a dealer that discriminates people. Just because a person of color COMES TO CHRYSLER DOES NOT MEAN THEY CAN'T AFFORD TO DROP $40-70K ON A WHIP. At the end of the day NO ONE F*CKS WITH CHRYSLER ANYWAYS. This is for the G Wagon, it fucking stinked. NEXXXXXXT.
