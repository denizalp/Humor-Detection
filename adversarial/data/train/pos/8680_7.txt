I was recently dining at Grape Street for the first time. As a vegetarian I am apprehensive about eating at new places.\n\nThe place has a great atmosphere that drew me in for a quick bite even though I was alone. They were friendly and promptly seated me on the patio as requested. \n\nThe food: I didn't have to wait long for fresh bread (good on the inner but very hard on the outside) however I had to wait a little while for the butter they forgot to serve with the bread...which I eventually asked for. I was happy when they had a vegetarian soup of the day and figured I would be safe ordering the house salad. When asked if I wanted chicken added, I clearly declined. The salad was served tossed and finely chopped almost like coleslaw. After eating 4 or 5 bites I noticed small chicken pieces in the salad. \n\nI summoned the waiter who at first tried to convince me it wasn't chicken lol. He then asked if it was a problem. \n\nYes it was. Congrats you messed up a simple salad and lost a customer. \n\nI just wanted to politely excuse myself and leave at that point. They comped the meal and offered to make a new salad. I left.
