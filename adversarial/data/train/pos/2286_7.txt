I love living at Copper Creek.  I have been here for 4 years now and I plan on renewing my lease again.  (As long as my job doesn't move me back to NYC.)  I think my dogs enjoy living here too because they are enjoying the bark park.\n\nThere are so many good things about Copper Creek, it is hard to name them all.   Location is awesome BTW. My only complaint is the parking at times- so I rented a garage and now I always have covered parking.  (Kinda a necessity in vegas.)\n\nA few people have commended about maintenance on this website and I'm totally surprised because the maintenance team here is actually pretty good.   I have definitely had a few service calls and Jim the maintenance guy always has shown up on time and fixed the issue.  When my dishwasher broke a few months ago he was there within a few hours, so I was happy about that.  \n\nIt is super convenient for me to pay my rent online so I rarely go into the office, so I've never had any of the issues others describe here.
