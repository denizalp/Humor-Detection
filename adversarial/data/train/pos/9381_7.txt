OK.  This place is where everyone on the East valley get their nails did!  It is sparkly, clean, and like a day club (the music, atomsphere, the nail bar, etc).  We had reserved 6 people for a baby shower...  Baby shower pedicure!!!  Sweetness.  We all got the Pink Polish Pedicure.  You get a choice of scrub.  I got a orange scrub.  The scrub and lotion came on this dishes (like a sushi dish).  The lady kept trying to up sale for this and that.  I said no once, so just please stop asking.  \n\nMy legs felt so SO soft and smooth.  I loved the color and shiney polish.
