I don't usually do reviews on bars or pubs because the times had can vary so vastly. There are so many factors that are different depending on each experience that any conclusions would be skewed and proven wrong the next time out. Factors such as alcohol level, the people you have in your company, how busy the bar is, whether there is a sporting event, if the kitchen is still open or not, and many others play a role in the experience. The reason I am reviewing the Auld Spot Pub is because of the washrooms.\n\nI was drinking and of course after a couple pints you have to relieve some tension. The first thing I noticed when I entered the washroom was how clean it was. No writting on the walls, no dust on the top of the stalls, just immaculately clean. The stalls were also made of a very light coloured wood which gave a very cozy feeling to it. That is when I noticed what kind of shocked me... No urinals!\n\nThis was probably one of the only men's washrooms that I have been in that did not have at least one urinal. I actually turned around the verify that it said men on the door. Definitely a bold choice. When I went into the stall it was as if they had Mr. Clean hiding around the corner to sparkle and shine whenever someone heads back upstairs to the pub. It was probably one of the cleanest toilets outside of someone's house that I have ever had the pleasure to return some alcoholic beverage to. \n\nAside from the washroom, the place was pretty nice. Booths, tall tables, the standard bar layout. It was actually the first pub I have been to that had Magners Irish Cider on tap instead of just Strongbow, which is a nice change. The service was very quick and the waitress was on top of our drinks. Of course it was 1:00am when we got there and the place was half empty. When we got there it was a younger college looking crowd, but the time last call was done with it was a much older group of people left. Not a bad place to stop by for a pint if you are in the area.
