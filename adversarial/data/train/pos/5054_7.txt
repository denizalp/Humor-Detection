SLOW...I should've been tipped off when they sat us next to a table of corpses (ok, they were still alive at the time of this posting).  Well, not \"I want to talk to the manager\" slow, but enough to get the \"What the f*ck is going on here\" chatter going, with only 2 tables of patrons in sight.   I'll assume there was some party in the back, but still, you've got to plan for that.  \n\nThe waiter was nice enough to bring me a refill AFTER we got our check.  Gee. Thanks.  By the way, you know that scolding hot plate you brought me earlier, well, the fish on it was also boiling hot.  Thank God I was able to generate a nice cooling breeze with all that ice in my glass.\n\nThe good thing is they do usually have pretty good food.  However, I would recommend one of their other locations.
