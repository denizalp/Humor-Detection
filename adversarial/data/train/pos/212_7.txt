After reading great reviews, we opted to come here.  We were definitely not WOW'd at the food and even disappointed a steakhouse would have such dull crappy steak knives!  Get better utensils, please, Chef Tom.\n\nThe service was alright but the food on the other hand, was disappointing!  We had intended to order the wagyu tasting menu but our waiter could not explain to us what was on the tasting and instead confused the heck out of us. \n\nStarters:\nHe ordered the quail and I ordered the foie gras.  The two little pieces of quail were nicely seasoned and tender but certainly did not blow us away. However, the foie gras was delicious.  The sweet candied kumquat accompanying the savory sauce created a perfect harmony with the foie gras.  We really enjoyed it.\n\nThen...we waited for twenty minutes between our starters and main dish which really was a bit longer than we'd liked!\n\nEntrees:\nI ordered the American Kobe filet mignon which was a HUGE disappointment.  I had requested for medium rare but the steak was cooked a bit more medium than I had liked.  Not to mention, the heavy handed seasoning defiled the filet.  The \"hint\" of blue cheese seared into the steak overpowered the tender cut and detracted from the meat.\n\nHe ordered the \"regular\" rib eye which was half the price of my American Kobe and it was DELICIOUS!  I don't ever regret ordering anything but boy did I absolutely wish I had ordered the rib eye too!  It was the one redeeming part of the meal thus far.\n\nSide dishes:\nThe Jerusalem artichokes were absolutely delicious (lots of fiber too!) It was cubed and reminded me of \"country fries\".  It was well seasoned and absolutely not oily at all.  It had great texture and the flavor was satisfying.  \n\nThe Tuscan kale and smoked bacon, on the other hand, was way too salty.  We had to say something about it, and the waiter indicated that this is the response they often get when this dish is on the menu.  They took it off our bill and brought  us a different sauteed vegetable.  They explained that the smoke bacon adds the salt to the dish but as the kale sits and the sauce reduces, the overall dish becomes saltier.  YIKES, disappointing.\n\nDessert:\nI ordered the panna cotta which was an extremely sophisticated, or as my honey puts it, \"adult\" dessert.  The panna cotta is infused with jasmine. Think of the panna cotta as a delivery mechanism for the jasmine flavor. The texture adds interest.  When tasted by itself the scent of jasmine is very strong which I enjoyed but he thought was too strong.  The panna cotta sits on a macaroon and when eaten together, it is a perfect contrast of chewy and creamy (not milky tho) and the floral scent adds to the overall experience.  The serving plate is drizzled with honey and thinly sliced asian pears accompanies the dessert.  There was a lot of components and maybe even a bit too much going on, but I liked it.  \n\nHe had ice cream which he called \"kiddy dessert\" - simple but excellent.\n\nExcluding alcohol, our bill was $270, which in absolute terms isn't expensive per se, but in terms of the value we were expecting, it wasn't really worth it!  \n\nAt over $110, the American Kobe filet was a BIG disappointment.\nAt $24, the foie gras, although tasty, was a really small portion for the price.  The kale was just overall salty and blah.  \n\nI really wanted to like this place more.
