Total WIne is like a hobby shop for alcoholics. \nI can find everything here including the hard to find RumChata.\nIf you like good whiskey, they feature Midleton for thirty bucks less than other places.\nThe wine and craft beer selection is enormous. \n\nSometimes, I only visit to look at all the vintage Bordeaux wines I can't afford as I fantasize about tunneling from across the way and hiring drug mules to steal them blind. Especially all their Petrus.\nAnd with all that Petrus, I'd have a sweet girlfriend too, maybe Jennifer Aniston.\n\nAnd while I'm at it, I'd steal all their Cristal magnums as well. Then I'd ply Jen with the Cristal in the back of my F-150 and commence to motorboating her sweet hangers.\n\nSometimes, Jen and I would drink it right out of her Jimmy Choo stilettos. Then we'd go downstairs into my dad's basement and play Frogger on our old arcade machine.\nI almost always beat her. \nShe has no Frogger skills.\n\nFive stars for Mexican Xanax.\nFive for Fireball.\nFive for Total Wine.\n\nFive more for Jen. None if she happens to whoop me at Frogger.
