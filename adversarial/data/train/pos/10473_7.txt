I've been here twice now, and both times the food was fabulous.  Ate at the cooking table both times, and had the vegetable dinner both times.  It comes with tofu and it was prepared differently both times.  Good both times, but I did prefer it the first time I was there.\n\nOur chef was great!  A lot of fun, and very friendly!  Sadly he had just put in his two weeks notice and was transferring to the Goodyear location.\n\nAll in all, a great place.  We will definitely go back.
