Best BBQ in AZ, I still have yet to find a better choice and I have eaten at many establishments throughout the valley.  The fatty brisket and beans are a must, but you can't go wrong with anything.  The lamb neck is amazing, rich and flavorful along with there gigantic beef ribs (those are one day a week specials).\n\nLong lines but so worth the wait, go if you haven't been, you will not regret your decision with this Texas style BBQ joint.
