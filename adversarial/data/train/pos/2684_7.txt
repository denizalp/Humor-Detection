Everything about this place reeks of Vegas: hot chics waitresses who show off their pretty young boobs, pretty boy waiters who chat and flirt with their fellow employees as the food in the kitchen sits, and waits....and waits.....and waits to be served. \n\nOk, I ordered an American burger medium rare with fries and a beer. I was placed up front by the kitchen and could watch the dudes in the back making the orders. The food looked and smelled great! Alright, I was excited and ready to eat!\n\nBut the orders, after being made, just sat there where the cooks placed the food. So many plates would fill up the area that they ran out of room to place them there; they'd start to shuffle the plates around to any available area.\n\nI got my 'burgr' and it was of good quality, but it was cold and not very appetizing. I told the airhead, pleasantly busty boobed waitress and all she could say was, \"Um, ok. But its good, right? I mean, its cold, but its good, right?\"\nReplying that it was cold and not what I wanted from a 'burgr', she told me that I had ordered it medium rare and maybe that's why it was cold. Hmmm........I gave up and tried the manager.\n\nLong story short, I chewed her out and got another 'Burgr' that was good, but after all the hassle I had to go through to get a decent meal I say screw this overhyped, inefficiently ran celebrity chef dumphole.\n\nAND, after this experience, I decided not to try any more Gordon Ramsay restaurants during my trip to Vegas.
