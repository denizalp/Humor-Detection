I must've been in a very strange mood last night to even come to a karaoke place. I'm the faux Asian who doesn't eat rice or do karaoke but I was there to be with a great group of friends.  They were pretty busy for a week night probably because karaoke rooms are 25% off from Sunday to Thursday. We had a group of 8 so we got a medium room (fits up to 10 people).\n\nSoju was buy 2, get 1 free! I must say their flavored soju were pretty strong compared to the \"B\" place on Spring Mountain. They don't serve hard liquor other than regular soju.  Service was great. We press the button to call for a server and he was there in a few seconds...every single time!  Like a karaoke genie (what?).\n\nAfter a few shots of soju...holy Spice Girls (and Oasis...I like Brits apparently)! I sang a few songs but I ended up having such a great time. I was amongst good friends, I had no shame...especially in a private room. \n\nThe rooms were well-insulated and people from other rooms couldn't hear us being loud and we couldn't hear them either.  They have newer songs on their list too but some people in the group wanted more of the old typical karaoke songs\/singers\/bands i.e. Journey...and I forgot what else.\n\nGood times...
