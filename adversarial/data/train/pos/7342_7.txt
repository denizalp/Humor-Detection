I really wanted to like this place...\n\nSo, the restaurant is located in a bit of a rundown bit of a depressing food court.  It is a restaurant so don't despair if you walk into the mall and find all the food kiosks to be closed.  \n\nI ordered the salad udon.  I was expecting some sort of soy sauce, sesame oil, ginger type dressing ... what I got was a bowl of noodles topped with some waxy tasting lettuce - DROWNING in hyper sour, very from the bottle tasting ITALIAN dressing.  \n\nMy husband ordered some sort of rice and meat dish.  What he got was a sad looking bowl of rice topped with an even sadder lump of ground beef cooked in sweet brown sauce ... basically something I could have made at home but better.  \n\nWe were also a little disappointed in the portion size of our meals too.  Even though we managed to finish both our dishes, we left hungry.  \n\nNot sure if it was an off day for the restaurant but we'll most likely not come back to see...\n\np.s. There are no highchairs
