Park closer to Macy's. Go through Macy's, when you exit the back, make a left. \n\nFor an Apple Store, it was pretty standard. You have your Genius workers that try to assist the swarms of customers. \n\nThe purpose of my visit was to purchase the iPhone 6 Plus. When I arrived to the store, the security guards informed me that I had to wait in line with the others who were intended to purchase the phone as well. No problem. I was number 11 in line, so how bad could that be? Well, I waited in line for TWO hours until a worker from the store took my name. During that two hours, not one person from the line was being helped. I sent my husband in the store to inquire what was taking so long and of course they give a very general answer, \"We're doing the best we can.\" Umm...no. The best would be taking in at least 3 customers - get them in and out. Well, at almost the three hour mark, I just walked out of the line. Based on this experience I would have given this store a one star, but who am I kidding. I am Apple junky and I will probably be back in line next year when the next phone generation is released. Same goes for the next gen iPad, iPod, MacBook, etc. So, it would be pointless for me to write such a negative review, and then you'll see my ass back at that store.
