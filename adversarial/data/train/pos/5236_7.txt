I can only speculate Tony's is authentic Mexican Cuisine (Which sounds funny because Tony makes me think of Italian - you know the old joke...\"To NY\"... Anyhoot.) As I've not been that far south yet. Tony's is a Taqueria for Gringos I guess? All the stuff on the menu is photographed and translated into English. The food is flavorful and relies on the food as opposed to being overpowered by excess oil & spices. \n I like that every table has a variety of 3 different hot sauces and the waitstaff is extremely nice and pretty fast. Overall I am not exactly sure you wanna come from all over to hit up this Mexican joint but if you're in the area it's most definitely worth the trip.
