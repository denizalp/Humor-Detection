First the good.  This was one of the best steaks I've had.\nCooked just right, presented in a minimalistic way.  It's Steak.  That's it. And it's good.\n\nThe kitchen did a great job!\n\nNow the bad:\nWe arrived at our reservation time which was basically the same time they opened (still on east coast time.)  When we checked in at the hostess stand we were told there were 7 parties before us and that we would have to wait across the hall so as not to block the entrance.\n\n!!??!!  WTF?  We were dressed up nicely and told to go stand someplace else?  There is no waiting area so we had to linger around within sight of the front desk.  I can understand being delayed if there is a slow turn over, but to come to a place that is 10% full and not given a time when would be seated was pretty bad.\n\n20 minutes later we were seated.\n\nThe ambiance is more Disney than steakhouse.  The over sized table was novel at first but wore off fast as it was difficult to sit at.  Small side portions for large prices.  It's Vegas so things are expensive,  but this just didn't deserve it.\n\nMario!  How could you?
