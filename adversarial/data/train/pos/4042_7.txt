Great stone crab and steak. Excellent bread bowl. Unlimited, actually. The cheese bread was amazing. I couldn't stop eating it. Steak was tender and well prepared. The stone crab was cracked for you so that you don't have to deal with opening it over and over again. The sides are good too, so do not miss. What I liked about this place is that it's actually more approachable and casual than some of the other restaurants which are more for sitting down and leisure meals. Here you can get great service and a totally unusual food. And the service was expeditious so that you can go back to the hotel room to work. \n\nGranted, this is Vegas. Calvin Trillin, the esteemed columnist from New Yorker once said that during Trump era, where many liberal elites wake up in panic, he practices counting shrimps consumed in Vegas to calm himself down. Vegas does have some odd eats. Who could have thought Vegas is the shrimp consumption capital? There are more shrimps eaten in Vegas than anywhere else in the world. I really think we should look into stone crab consumption as well. \n\nWe had a fantastic meal here. I was lucky to be taken here. We took our leisurely walk back to the hotel. A great eatery. Fantastic companion. Excellent choice of dining establishment when in town. Do not miss.
