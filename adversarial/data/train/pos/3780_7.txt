I don't believe there's a such thing as a bad time to visit Wasted Grain. I had a blast there under its past life as Martini Ranch, and I still think it's awesome now.\n\nHere's the deal. It has: \n\n-A cool little local music venue on the first floor\n-An awesome patio, now equipped with *two* bars\n-A real groovy lounge upstairs\n\nIt really does cater to the tastes of everyone. You can get your club on at night, but it's a good spot during the day as well. No one who works here is a douche. I'll return. I'll even recommend it to anyone!
