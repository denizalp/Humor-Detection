Eastwind Sushi is somewhat Pan-Asian Cuisine. Prices are very reasonable and all the  food I tried so far was tasty.\n\nThis time we tried a spicy tuna roll to start with. I will say the tuna was cleaner tasting than what you can get from NOT ALL but several near by sushi places. The sushi menu had mostly rolls with cream cheese or rolls that were deep fried so I had a salad for dinner.\n\nI had the Spicy Thai Style Beef Salad. My salad was big and tasty. It didn't remind me of Thai Food but it tasted good and the beef was tender. I thought it was a pretty good salad and I think it ran about $7.99?\n\nMy husband had the Korean Style Hot and Spicy with Beef. The food seemed fresh and was flavorful. \n\nFor me this is more of a stir fry place or salad place and your opinion may differ.\n\nI thought they were deserving of 4 stars because of the clean tasting tuna, low prices and everything I tried so far tasted good.
