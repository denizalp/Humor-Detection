I've been here dozens of times over the years but for some reason, I've never Yelped it.  Well, since I'm doing the better late than never thing this weekend, I'll do it now.\n\nPopped in here for the annual Red & White Birthday Bash for Sonny B. (still running strong at 73).\n\nGreat atmosphere, with a kick ass back patio area.  Grabbed my usual spot and ordered up their oh so refreshing Hefeweizen, in a tall frosty mug.  I also chowed on their burger with fries which also hit the spot.\n\nCaught up with old friends, made some new friends, took a few pics and then Mel and I hit the road for some impromptu green light fun down Scottsdale Road.  \n\nReminded me of the good old days.
