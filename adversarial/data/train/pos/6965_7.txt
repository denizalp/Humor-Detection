CZ is killin' it! \nFor a long time I was eating here so often and got burnt out but Friday night we decided to eat in and watch a movie in the couch so I stopped in to CZ and SAAHHHWEEET so happy I did! \nI ordered the braised pork salad and southwest green chili soup that I'm still thinking about. \nHow tasty and flavorful both were. HIT THE SPOT. My husband ordered the lobster grilled cheese with clam chowder and he kept trying to eat mine! Nope. Not sharing this meal buddy. I want to go back this week and order the same exact meal and suggest you do the same! I forgot how yummy and tasty Caf√© Zupas was!
