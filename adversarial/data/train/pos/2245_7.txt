Dr. Steelman was amazing!!!! Having 4 cats gets difficult but I know where I'm coming from now on!!! I highly recommend this cat hospital. It's also an adoption center! There's a huge room full of cats! Now only some are adoptable so don't get too hung up on one without asking first whether the one you have in mind is available. Now coming in was very easy. Fill out 4 papers and you're good. No appointments needed, although it's always recommended. Dr. Steelman is pretty busy so you have the option to keep your cats there over night so she can check everything out after closing hours. From what I remember it's $65. They feed them and take care of them. She looked at Shadow and when she realized she needed to do blood work, she called us and explained why she felt like it was necessary and asked for our permission before doing anything!!! I love that and comes in handy so you have in mind how much everything will cost. No one likes unexpected costs so that was extremely respectful. There's a number that you can text and it's her assistant who actually responds late at night too (around 11:30 pm) even though they're closed! They make it so comfortable and easy for me to trust them. It only took her one day to fully examine Shadow. When we went in, she told us everything in full details and never rushed us. She even supplied medication for the entire month and some food and supplies!!! She's so knowledgeable about everything, and yes I know she's supposed to but you'd be surprised with how little some people know about their own career field. Everything was done for a fair price as well. I'm so pleased with how smoothly everything went!
