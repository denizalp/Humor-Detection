Went there yesterday for a quick peek on the new boba store. It's interior is simple, modernistic, and clean which is always a plus for me. Their menu have rice combo that is to die for, varieties of ice cream flavor, and of course, boba drinks. :)\n\nI spoke with the boss and he told me everything on the menu are high quality and self selected by him (and his wife). Obviously he wants everything on the menu to surpass the rest of the other competitive stores out there. So skimming through the boba list, I decided to try the taro smoothie and several different types of ice cream. And I've got to say, he's right. Not only was the smoothie taste just right but you can really tell that it's not artificial taro flavor (I know because I drank so many taro smoothies that I know which one taste good and which is bad :P). The same with their ice cream! Omgg, I can really find myself to be a regular when summer arrives. Their creamy dessert makes me feel like a giddy child when I savor their delicious creation and I'm not even a fan of ice cream! Mmm I can feel my day become all better already just by thinking of it. :)\n\nSo overall, from my personal experience, I'll say you'll get your money worth when you come Boba City.
