Sushi kaya is hands down my favorite \"All you can eat Sushi\" restaurant in Las Vegas. I've been coming here for quite awhile now and refer all my friends and family. \n\nMust order when I'm here:\n-Alaskan Roll (no eel sauce)\n-Cajun Albacore extra extra serried \n-Cinderella Roll (no eel sauce)\n-Edamame Steam\n-Baked Mussel\n-Beef, Shrimp & Scallop sticks \n-Udon Soup\n-Mango Mochi     \n\nOMG make sure you ask for ponzu sauce. Sooooo yummy!
