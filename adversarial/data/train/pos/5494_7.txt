Never really experiencing Las Vegas done right and from eating most of my meals in Vegas at places off the strip, like dim sum at Ping Pang Pong.. I was excited to eat something at a touristy place.  \n\nLoving Italian food and all things pasta, I couldn't wait to be seated at this place.  We chose to sit in the not-so-outdoor dining area to people watch and enjoy the 'view'.  \n\nWhen our server came along he seemed to be nice enough as he took our drink orders first.  While waiting for him to come back to take our actual food orders another duo came and sat in the next table beside us.  He proceeded to take their drink orders and walked past our table even when we tried to flag him down.  As we waited for our drinks to come he once again passed us while chatting away with a fellow server.  WTF?  Finally giving up I decide to use the restroom while I tell my friend to order for me in case that husky slob of a waiter finally decides to come to our table.   \n\nWhen I get back surprisingly my friend has ordered for the both of us and even has his coke he ordered, however my glass of water is no where to be seen.  The other table who came in and ordered after us has both of their drink orders as well as some bread on the table.  20 minutes have passed and we only have one drink and no bread.   We wait another 10 minutes and I still don't have my damn water or any bread and by that time I'm starving.  While during the whole time our incompetent server is leaning at the bar chatting away.  \n\nWho the fuck hired this fool?\n\nIn the end we ask another server for a refill on my friend's coke, once we get it we proceed to walk out with glass of coke in hand.  I bet the imbecile didn't even realize we left and came to the empty table with both entrees.  \n\nI would come again, just because I've heard the food is pretty good, but if moron ends up being my waiter again, I'll be sure as hell to throw a bitch fit with management and insist I have someone else.
