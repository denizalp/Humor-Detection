Dear Ann Marie,\nThank you for your comment; however, you never tried to call us. I had to call back three days later and spoke to another supervisor about our situation. I was basically told the same thing with no resolution. The supervisor even apologized to me for not returning my call. She said she was, ironically, out sick.
