This place makes pancakes just like my momma used to make -- burnt, uneven and too dry. \n\nI keep coming back though because the first time I came in I liked it so much. I don't know when I'm going to give up. \n\nThree times I've been here and asked for scrambled eggs \"soft\" and \"wet\" and \"not too cooked\". I don't know what terminology will get the message to the cook that dry browned scrambled eggs aren't my favorite.  I have even sent them back only to have similarly overcooked eggs returned. \n\nThe coffee is good. Service is friendly if not especially good.  Prices are meh, ok if the food was decent.
