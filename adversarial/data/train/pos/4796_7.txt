ASIAN LEGEND IS IN THE SAME PLAZA. Jus' sayin'....FOR A REASON.\n\nSo, I came here with my dad for dinner and we ordered: \n\nSpicy beef noodle soup \n- Big enough for 2 to share, \n- generous amount of beef, but was not very tender\n- soup base was not spicy and needs to be more concentrated\n- noodles tasted plain, but pretty chewy\n\nSpicy lettuce \n- crunchy and juicy\n- absolutely drowned in chili oil (which made it more spicy than the noodle soup)\n- presentation was very unappealing\n\nSweet and sour chicken \n-this plate screamed MSG with its neon orange colour\n- suprisingly there was a lot of chicken meat instead of flour\n\nOverall: Like I said... Asian legend!
