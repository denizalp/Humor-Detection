I'd been noshing on chips with guac at most places around town during a time warp in which I was, coincidentally, avoiding the gym. I finally hauled my petite yet burdened frame to Lifetime for some cardio and then decided to reward myself with more chips with guac :)\nHowever, to cut a long story short, the menu board was angled in such a way that rolled tacos with guac sounded even better. I thought they would be like 'berto's cause everything about the menu & signage reminded me of it....but it wasn't :( The tacos were skinnier, the guac a bit thinner, and the sauce not so caliente. \nI think a hard-core gym rat like me deserves better - I'm gonna give it another shot for breakfast one day soon after I've pumped some iron or at least driven by Lifetime again :P
