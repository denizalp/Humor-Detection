No one wants to go to the doctor. No one wants to go to the type of doctor  who requires they remove all clothing to have their body examined by with a microscope. But skin checks are important. I last had one about a decade ago and haven't gone since. As someone with a billion freckles I should probably go every year, if not more. So, in the waning days of my maternity leave, I figured I would do something non baby-related and treat myself to a dermatology appointment. I found this particular practice from a Yelp search and it's one glowing review. The last time I visited a dermatologist's office I remember it took me about a century to get an appointment. This was not the case this time. I called last week and was booked for this week with no problem. The person on the phone was exceptionally nice and I found that to be the case in the office as well. From the front desk staff to the nurses, and the doctor as well, everyone was exceptionally friendly, quick, and efficient. Dr. Kreizenbeck was lovely and took her time explaining everything to me. I ended up having two biopsies, which I'm confident will come back negative. Though the procedures were not exactly painless, they were quick, and I have her to thank for it. If someone's going to scrape something off your skin she's a good one to do it. So, Yelp friends, don't put it off. Your health is too important, so get a skin check and consider this practice while you're at it!
