After having this bookmarked for over a year I finally made it out here to try their BBQ.  We had been riding the zip lines with FlightLinez and were pretty hungry.  Being from the southern U.S. I do love good BBQ and was excited to give Fox a try.  We were able to sit down right away which was unusual as this place can be busy from what I have been told.  \n  We each ordered something different so we could try a variety of their items.  The wife got the beef and pork ribs which were very good.  The meat was fall off the bone tender which is a good sign.  It was moist and smokey flavored.  Add in some of the sweet BBQ sauce and it was perfect.  I had the brisket and pulled pork.  The brisket was moist and smokey flavored also.  Dipped into the BBQ sauce it was super tasty.  The pulled pork was the let down.  It had only mild smoke flavor and was bland in taste.  Not as tender as it should have been so I won't order it again.  \n  We also had the fried okra which was delicious.  We all loved it and despite ordering a large we devoured it way too quickly.  The Okra is so good we stopped but a few weeks later while heading home from a hike and ordered a couple of large fried Okra's to go.  I also had their baked beans which were very good.  With a few veggies and some brisket added it they were a real treat.  i also had a side of their Mac and Cheese.  it was heavy on the cheese which for me was great.  I have to order mac and cheese and it be light on cheese.  Fox's mac and cheese was creamy and everyone enjoyed it.\n   Our waitress was awesome.  Super friendly and always paid attention if we needed anything.  The inside was clean and well decorated.  It had the feel of a southern BBQ restaurant so I felt right at home.  I am already craving the Okra and Brisket and will have to head another visit to Fox's soon!
