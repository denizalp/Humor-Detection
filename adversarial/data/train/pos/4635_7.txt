This first time I wandered in here a few years ago I was looking for a gift that was to be shipped out of state.  Without letting on she was the intended receiver I had asked whether women preferred flowers or chocolates.  Her answer was yellow and pink roses could always be given to friends.  So off to the mall I went, thinking I was probably getting perfume at some kiosk or something.  I wandered into Yankee Candle and they had a pink rose scent.  The receiver loves candles and when she got it a few days later she understood the connection to the generic question and enjoyed the candle.\n\nI have been back several times since then to buy candles for my apt (they smell better than smoke) and for gifts.  They always seem to have something on sale, with their biggest sales in January and July.  Yesterday I purchased two large Pumpkin spice jar candles, the second being 1\/2 off.  I have a problem with drafts when the A\/C is running and by buying an Illuma-lid I can get several months out of each candle even burning them every night.
