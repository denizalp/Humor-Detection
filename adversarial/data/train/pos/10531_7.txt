Help with lawsuit against Honda West, call Attorney Generals office for Nevada  to join as this topography dealer charged me for a non existent alarm device that does not even work with manual locks if it was installed. They are the worst of the worst and need to be closed down as when confronted just laughed and said you signed the paperwork. Help protect other consumers and let's get them in front if a judge.
