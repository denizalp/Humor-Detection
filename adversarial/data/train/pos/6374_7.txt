One hour on the phone to try to fix an email problem, then I get transferred to a different department, who then stated that they couldnt help to then get transferred to a different person who stated that they couldnt help me with their own service! I wish they had Centurylink in my neighborhood. Maybe they dont give a shit because they dont have to. Given a choice: run forrest run!
