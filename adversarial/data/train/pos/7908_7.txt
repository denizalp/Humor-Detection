Worst Starbucks I've ever been to. The drive thru line was moving at snail pace and when I finally got up to order, the guy disappeared or something. I waited for about 5 minutes and even said \"hello?\" A few times and nothing. I gave up and pulled forward and that's when Mr. Barista decides to return. I just went through the line without ordering anything in the end cause I left me with zero faith in them making anything that would taste good.
