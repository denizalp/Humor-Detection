My husband and I were fed up with the overpriced dining options available at the Las Vegas Convention Center during the Wizard World Comic Con, so we opted to dine at SLS instead and ended up choosing Unami Burger for our dinner spot. According to the online menu, there's a black bean burger available. The menu lies. There was, however, a vegetarian \"burger\" option that was pointed out to me by the hostess. Salvation!\n\nSLOPPY MAMI ($12): I'd best describe this as a vegetarian sloppy joe. The burger was topped with tasty lentils (so tasty it made me wonder why I'm not including more lentils in my diet), a fried onion \"haystack\" (I hate onions but actually liked these), and slithers of jalapenos. Melted cheese held everything together. I was impressed with this Sloppy Mami. The downsides? Not enough jalapeno and it comes a la carte. 4\/5 \n\nTHIN FRIES ($4): You simply cannot eat a burger without a side of fries. Thumbs up for these fries! 4\/5\n\nBEEF NACHOS ($10): I loved that the nachos came with a side dish of salsa. Who does that?? No one, that's who. My husband super duper liked this dish. 4\/5\n\nSERVICE: The food came out within 7 minutes of ordering, but service was intermittent. There's room for improvement. 3\/5 \n\nVIBE: The layout is kind of weird since the SLS Sports Book is inside Unami. Weird, I know. There's Unami diners, and then there's people lounging on sofas watching sports on TV. The restaurant was pretty rambunctious, noise wise.   \n\nWorth a Return Visit?\nI'm hoping to come back on Social Sundays to score a 50% discount!\n\nYELP 100 CHALLENGE 2015: #96
