Yesterday was my first time at HT. The beer list was great, lots if options. Being a vegetarian it is usually hard to find things to eat at a place like HT. Me and my boyfriend both ordered the veggie burger with additional toppings, for lack of a better word it was, mediocre. \nI do need to point out the staff though. It just so happens that the host we should of had was an ex of my bf (I'm not putting names). Anyway, she made a big deal about us being there. Hid in the back and made us feel like we weren't welcome. It took at least 7 minutes to get greeted then seated. After 5 years you would think she would be over it.  \n\nNeedless to say we probably won't be back.
