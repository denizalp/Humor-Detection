This place is your typical fast food mediterranean type of place but better.  Ive had the chicken (gyro and kabob)  as well as the shirk, both were wonderfully seasoned without being salty.  They have yummy baklava as well (they have the square regular kind a well as the ones that are rolled up (those have a different name but I can't remember) \nThe service is also really quick, about 5 to 10 minutes.  \n(please ignore all of the posts about the wait being 45 min, or at least take into consideration that it was the grand opening of the summerlin mall and there were only 2 other restaurants open) \nGive it a try!
