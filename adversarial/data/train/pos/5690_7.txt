So if youre looking for cute women... This is your spot. If you're looking for good food.... Keep looking. \nI ordered the Steak and Prawns for $27.99- kind of expensive but I wanted to treat myself- as did my buddy. So heres why I have 1 star. \nI asked to replace the potatoes with more vegetables- my buddy got 5 small potatoes and veggies while I got maybe 3 extra pieces of carrots- lame. \nI also paid $1 to get mushrooms- so this included literally half of a button mushroom cut into 7 peices.... \nNow onto the \"prawn\". These so-called Prawns are actually cocktail shrimp- and small ones for that matter. And I was only given 3.... Three small shrimps. What the hell?!? \n\nSo obviously this bar- thats what it is and not a restaurant- isnt meant for delish meals but for beer, sports and boobs.
