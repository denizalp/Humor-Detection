I quite enjoy hot yoga, and the hot yoga wellness chain is one of the higher quality chains in York region. \n\nThe type of yoga here is very similar to Moksha, yet you'll never know exactly what type you have. It seems like most of the instructors have their signature formula. -Not a problem for a schedule that lists instrutor names by the timings. \n\nThe best teacher (out of the two I've tried) is Jovita, and I'm quite familiar with her consistency and manner of instruction since I've taken her class at Hot Yoga Markham as well. She's a very flexible, agile yogi and a very clear instructor.  \n\nThe studio is very new and located in a commercial unit nearby a few East Asian restaurants and a Starbucks(at McNicoll and Midland). You should fill up your water bottle ahead of time, because the only taps are available in the washroom and if you have a large bottle, good luck. \n\nAll in all a decent Yoga school worth looking into if you live in Scarborough, because there aren't many quality options in the area.
