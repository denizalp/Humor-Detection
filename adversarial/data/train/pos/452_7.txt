Yes. YES.\n\nI'm no dietician, but if Razzy Fresh had vegetable and meat toppings, I'm pretty sure all the food groups would be covered and I could eat here exclusively for the rest of my life. Sadly, I do not live anywhere near RF, and have to revert back to my normal diet of bourbon and bourbon.\n\nEvery time I walk in I feel like I'm some celebrity chef on the Food Network. Stay with me. Lychee, taro, and chocolate yogurt? Fucking obviously. Mango juice balls, Captain Crunch, and 27 gummy worms? Top that ish off. This is some Bobby Flay ice cream-equivalent shit right here.
