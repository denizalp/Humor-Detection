Duuuuuuuuuuuude\n\nThis might be the best pizza in CLE.   No joke.   The crust is chewy deliciousness.   Sauce,  cheese,  pepperoni all on point and high quality.   The pizza bakes in about 2 or 3 minutes.   There are a few seats inside at a bar that allows you watch them hand stretch and top your pie before it goes into the oven.   Cool music plays overhead.   Hip staff.   Damn that crust rocks my world.  Good schtuff... I just wish they would put more sauce on the pizza.
