Everyone's food was gross.  The meat was mushy and unflavored.  Thank goodness my check in with Yelp got me a free drink because I needed something to choke down the dry, mushy, unflavored chicken shawarma pita I ordered.  My friends also hated their food.  I pretty much knew the chicken shawarma plate my friend ordered would suck since my pita did but my other friend ordered the falafel and beef pita.  The falafel was so much to his disliking that he didn't even bother eating the pita.  So in all fairness that might have actually been good.  \n\nHowever, it was a sad, sad day for my appetite and taste buds.  I'm normally not this harsh but upon reviewing my Wells Fargo bank statement the $19 spent there just reminded me of how annoyed I was that this was food was ugh!  Y'all were actually encouraging us to go on Yelp like you were just waiting to hear something good LOL!  If we would have eaten there I would have been honest with you but since we took it home here is the review you wanted.  I wouldn't suggest anything other than getting a better cook.....maybe someone who's actually middle eastern and not Black.  I'm not hatin because hell, I'm Black but it didn't even taste like Black folks cooking middle eastern style it just tasted um like gross!  I'm in tears writing this because I cannot believe that you guys had at least 4 stars.  I mean who ARE these people, former prison inmates??!!!  That is all.  I won't be back.  Thank goodness for Pita Kitchen, Pita Bistro and Pita Jungle in Phoenix!
