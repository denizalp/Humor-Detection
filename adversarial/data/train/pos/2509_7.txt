Around the west side of Cleveland, trying to find a locally owned, casual but decent restaurant right in your neighbourhood is difficult (er, make that impossible).  But now that Ohio's non-smoking laws have been in effect for a few years, casual diners have turned to bars and pubs for local dining.  True, these beer joints are about the ONLY choice!  But at least some are pretty darn OK.\n\nIf you can stay in your lane (virtually unmarked) and you're comfortable steering through a slalom course (Fairview's Lorain Road) without hitting any parked cars, bicyclists or pedestrians check out Arts Pub.  Although the burgers, spaghetti and meat loaf are pretty darn good, the menu is much broader than the usual pub fare and the results are surprising.\n\nArts features a tempting special every night (maybe a steak or prime rib or a seafood pasta) usually under $10.  Salad greens are fresh and included with most entrees...and the weekday crowd is usually small and rather quiet.  Factor in some homemade soups and attentive food servers and you have a darn pleasant dining experience.  Plus your meal money stays local.\n\nNext time I stop at Arts Pub I'll head outside where each table has a front-row seat on the Lorain Slalom.  From here, patrons can sip a brew and dine while watching Fairview cops ticket drivers who are unaware of the mastery required to steer through the course.
