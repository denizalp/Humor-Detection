After 16 years with Cox we have finally had enough! I have paid a pretty penny for internet, phone and cable (close to $300 per month). \n\nWe have had to have multiple service calls that 95% of the time never showed up. When we would call we were always told they didn't see our appointment on the schedule. This happened at least 10 times. When they did show it was hit or miss if they actually solved the problem. When installing the new digital upgrade they ran a cable across the front of our house. That looked really nice! Once again we had to call to have them to reinstall the cable around the windows. They didn't show twice for that appointment.\n\nSo the day came when I finally called to cancel. The person I was speaking to was the rudest person I have ever encountered. He harassed me asking why I wanted to cancel. When I explained to him why, he continued to insist that I'm making a mistake etc... I finally had to get my husband on the phone because this ignorant man would not listen. My husband asked to speak to a supervisor and was told \"no\". Really? This customer service is the reason we don't want to deal with this company any longer.
