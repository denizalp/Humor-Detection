SBC VEGAS SERIES: 16 of many reviews\nSo I figure that if Rockhouse was good.. then IP must be better...\n\nOk, maybe better was too strong a word. But it was definitely something interesting after stumbling through Rockhouse. Again not quite the best place on the strip... yeah, on the STRIP. Go figure. Yes, I don't think I would stay here with the tackier than normal tacky Vegas kitsch that can be found everywhere else. But they do have some interesting table side performances that apparently the typical IP clientele enjoy every enthusiastically. \n\nOk, truth be told I had come here for a couple of drinks.. couple of very stuff drinks and a lot of people watching. And by people I mean to say the waitresses. And by waitresses I mean to say waitresses that do porn on the side. And by porn on the side, I mean that they probably could be very successful at doing porn on the side. I only wish that they would serve me while I sat at the bar instead of at the tables. What can I say.. I got my eye on the prize. \n;D
