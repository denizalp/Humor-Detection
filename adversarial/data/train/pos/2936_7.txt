some girl handed each of us some stupid \"buy a drink at Kahunaville get a shot for free\" card as we walked through TI.  Continued on to see the TI \"pirate show\" then went back inside to grab a drink (and supposedly free shot).  Were seated, handed menus, saw waitress when we walked in, waited 10 minutes, and couldnt see anybody in sight other than the bartender juggling an EMPTY bottle of Captain Morgan and the host was talking to some random guy outside.\n\nWe left.  Suck it.
