Definitely the prettiest Thai restaurant!  I walked in to meet with one of my favorite girls, Ayesha S., and saw her sitting at a HUGE table.  Huge.  For two of us.  It was a big, round, marble monstrosity but very stylish.  \nWe started out with the spring rolls with shrimp.  They came out and they were gigantic!  That must be the theme here.  Definitely fresh ingredients and nothing in it was overdone.  \nService was a little spotty at the beginning, but improved during our meal.  They refilled out drinks a few times without having to be asked.\nI got the spicy mussels.  They came on a big (HUGE) platter with a few sauteed veggies and a spicy sauce.  I know mussels aren't very good as a leftover, so I ate them all.   I didn't feel stuffed like Thanksgiving at the end of the meal, but properly sated.\nI will definitely be back again.  I'd like to try a few more items on the menu.  Like Ayesha, I'd like to see more heat.  \"If it don't make ya cry, why would ya eat it??\"\nI'd also like to meet the owner.  I mean, since everything is so huge...maybe it's a reflection? ;}
