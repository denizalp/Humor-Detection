I love that there is a Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf in the Palazzo and right near the suite elevators for when you need it. However, their prices are SO ridiculous. For example:\n\nCup of coffee: $3.45\nMocha \"frappuccino\" with 2 extra shots of espresso: $9.70 (no exaggeration!)\n\nI'd rather play some money at the Craps table (and hopefully win too!) and order a free coffee... I might even add some Kahlua in it if I'm feeling crazy...
