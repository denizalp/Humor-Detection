I really miss the OLD Cheers. I loved the old bartenders, regulars, and dive-y, chill atmosphere. \n\nSince they have reopened, I have given Cheers Tavern several opportunities to make me a regular. It seems that this place has no desire to keep the old clientele. It's disappointing that I have lost a place to hang out -- at least there's still Tony's. \n\nNew Cheers is too pricey for a dive bar. I don't see why this place is ever busy because of the prices. Although, if this place was slightly enjoyable, I would gladly pay for their over-priced drinks.\n\nThey are competing with the other bars in Glendale, for the douchey-ist bar in the valley. Which is sad because there are so many bro-friendly bars on the westside. None of the old regulars come to this bar and, from what it seems, new Cheers doesn't even attempt to retain the old regulars. Also, the owners' responses to the once-regulars' reactions on the changes are crass and appalling. VERY UNPROFESSIONAL. \n\nAlthough, one plus-side is their bathrooms are no longer disgusting -- hence, the one star. \n\nI miss Sunni, Missy, Jess, and, MORE IMPORTANTLY, everything about the OLD Cheers. Once again, they have lost another paying customer, who was once a loyal regular.
