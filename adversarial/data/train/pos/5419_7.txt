Now that I live in Old Town, this is my new \"go-to\" deli.  I've been a handful of times over the last few weeks and Goldman's has not let me down!\n\nRecently, I've had their tuna salad, egg salad, vegetable knish and matzah ball soup (not all in one sitting).  Both the tuna and egg salads are light - not too much mayo - just the way I like it.  And, the tuna has a really smooth consistency and a sweet flavor to it which makes it unique... I think they must mix in some sweet relish or something.  Whatever it is, I really like it!\n\nAgain, not much on atmosphere unless you're into the over 60 crowd, but quality deli... I'll take out Goldman's any day!
