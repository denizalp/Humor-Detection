As a sometimes employee (when the mood arises)  of Abercrombie & Fitch West Towne, I can confirm first hand what everyone already knew.....we hate our jobs and we don't have the slightest inclination to help you or any other stuck up 14 year-old find their perfect jean skirt or beaded top.  The clothes are mediocre in quality except for the newer Ezra line.  Unfortunately however you pay for it....jeans are $135 and sweaters can be up to $200....save that money for a shopping spree in Chicago.  The music is headache-inducing....as if Hillary Duff wasn't bad enough already, A&F has the techno remix.  I loved this place in High School, but I think I am outgrowing it...give me Banana Repiblic any day.  2 Stars
