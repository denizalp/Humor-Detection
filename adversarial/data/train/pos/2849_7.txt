Addendum to my earlier review - I did say that I would be able to give a more meaningful review on my second visit when I am actually sober. \n\nI would like to retract that.  After finding out that Social House messed up a reservation that I made for my BFFL's birthday dinner, thankfully a couple of days before the actual dinner, I doubt I would ever see the inside of Social House again. \n\nWe're going to Nobu instead.
