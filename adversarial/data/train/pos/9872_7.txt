If you're a picky sushi eater, don't waste your time here... it may be cheap, but the service and quality reflect that.\n\nSomehow, I managed to spend about $25 on my dinner there tonight, even with happy hour pricing.  I know, it's not so bad for sushi... but the service was extremely off, and the sushi was just meh.\n\nI'd been before and I'm sure I'll go again, just with the expectations in check next time.\n\nI shared an order of yellowtail sashimi, an I also had a seaweed salad (it was violet in color - have you ever seen that before?), a scallop handroll (generous in serving size but way too creamy for my liking), and an order of ikura.  \n\nWe sat in the bar area... it was fine for a casual dinner with friends, but nothing fancy at all.  There are much better sushi places to choose from - even in AZ!
