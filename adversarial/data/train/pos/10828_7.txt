411 Locals were asked to make for me a website and SEO. It was about half a year ago. I can say that in the beginning of the project I was not very convinced that that the website will appear on the first google page. Why - because in my city there are many companies and freelancers \nthat are offering the same service and are already on first google page. \n\nThat is why I was skeptic about the promised first google page presence. \nBut during the 4-Th mount  - surprise. And not just a surprise, but nice surprise. My site was on first google page. \n\nI was amazed. My orders and purchases are mainly online and that is why it is so important the first google page presence. The stats shows that around 90% of the people, searching in google for a service or business, are looking only the first page. \n411 Locals told me about this stats. But just to be more confident I checked other sources of information too. The figures were the same - approximately 90%.\n\nWould like to mention that the customer service was more than great. I spoke with two different representatives during the process and they coordinated their work very properly from my point of view.\n\nLet me describe in short the process. First, I received a cold call promising me first google page presence. That I checked the company and decided to go on with them.\nThere were few different conversations and emails, before the start of the real work. Actually, this step took too much time from my point of view - about 2 weeks. \n\nThen they collected from me company dated and thy started work on my online project. In 2 weeks the site was ready and it was listed properly. Meanwhile they were doing continuously the seo part as well. Additionally, I asked the to create for my business properly looking social profiles. As a result, the job was done and all the expected outcomes - achieved.
