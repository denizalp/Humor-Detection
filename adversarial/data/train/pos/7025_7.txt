A little surprised to see the lackluster reviews here.\n\nRamen is one of my favorite foods, and I think perhaps Touhenboku's ramen just resonated with me.  I ordered Tonkotsu ramen, which is 豚骨, meaning \"pig bone\".  Basically, pig bone is boiled to make Tonkotsu thick; just on the verge of gelatinous.  That was the ramen I had here.  Thick.  Heavy.  Oily.  Fatty and greasy chatsu.  Wonderful accoutrements.  I was in heaven.  This may have been even better than the ramen place near my home in NYC, Hinomaru.\n\nI just spent a month is Japan and had countless ramen.  I have put on the pounds to prove it.  With the exception of only two Japanese ramen places, this was better than all the other ramen I had in Japan (my Japanese friends are insulted... sorry!)\n\nI never did make it to Santouka before I left for Japan, and that makes me sad.  One day, I'll try it.\n\nHowever, reading the reviews for Touhenboku, I can see that the other reviewers like a very different ramen than I do.  They don't seem to care for thick, dirty, oily Tonkotsu.  I do, so take my 5 stars with a grain of salt, depending on what kind of ramen you enjoy.
