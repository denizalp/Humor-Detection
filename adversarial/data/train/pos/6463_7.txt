So, we went back. And it was awesome.\n\nWe went on a weeknight, and, true to my review, I went whole hog, (no pun intended), and ordered a 2 Meat Barbecue Combo plate - the sausage link, and beef brisket. My boyfriend, ever steady, ordered the Prime Rib. \n\nNow, I don't really eat red meat. I mention this in a lot of reviews, and that mention is usually followed by \"...but this time, I did, and I loved it.\" So, I guess I do actually eat red meat now. Wacky. Thanks, Yelp, for contributing to the decay of my health and the fatty deposits inside my arteries. Do you even get fatty deposits in your arteries? Don't mind me, I'm just flaunting my lack of basic anatomical knowledge on the internet. Anyway, the beef brisket was awesome, and the sausage link was truly one of the most delicious things I have ever eaten. Really! I loved it. Tasty and smokey and sweetly tinged with barbecue sauce. The corn and the shoestring fries are still hanging out in the \"delicious\" zone, and my boyfriend once again wolfed down his prime rib like a champ. He also tossed out a compliment to his side of macaroni and cheese, saying that it was \"really good.\" From him, that is a ringing endorsement.\n\nOur server was sweet and efficient, and not at all obnoxious. A+, Sawyer! You were great.\n\nThe little bag of Thank-Q doughnuts was adorable...we didn't get those on our first visit, and, even though we were completely stuffed, we appreciated the gesture and somehow found the digestive strength to scarf them down on the way home.\n\nThanks for a wonderful night, Jason. Your customer service is out of this world.
