After flying in to Scottsdale for the weekend, my friends and I hit up Old Town Gringos to check out the Old Town scene. Yikes. I was pretty disappointed by how dead Old Town Gringos was at 11:30pm on Friday night especially when the pictures I've seen of this place online look very lively and fun. I can totally see the potential of this place though. It has multiple decks (I think the place goes up to 3 stories) that overlook the central bar and dance floors below. \n\nI ordered the Whiskey River cocktail, but unfortunately it was made terribly and was basically undrinkable. The bartender put in WAY too much syrup and bitters. I had to take baby sips, but the taste became unbearable to a point where I just gave up drinking it entirely. Mind you this drink was filled halfway in a whiskey glass. I probably should've asked for a different drink, but the drink deterred me enough to question the bartender's skills. I didn't think the food was any better than my drink either. My friend ordered a taco platter. I didn't try the tacos, but I had a fork full of beans and rice. Old Town Gringos apparently has a problem with excess in general. The beans were extremely salty.
