While driving to the SoBe Ice Arena in the northern part of Las Vegas, my travel companion eyed KoMex. Intrigued by the name, and the concept of a fusion of Korean and Mexican cuisine, we stopped by for a quick noshing after completing our event at the rink. \n\nThere's not much going on in terms of decor or ambience in this little eatery, but those types of trivialities should be shelved; it's the food that is king at this local hotspot. KoMex has all the appearances of a neighborhood taco shop, but it really is a full service, sit-down restaurant.  Upon entry, it was refreshing to see a sign that loosely read, \"This is not fast food. Expect to wait a little longer for your meal.\"  And that was just fine with us.\n\nWe decided to share an order of the Bulgogi Nachos. In addition, I ordered one of their shrimp tacos, while my lunching companion selected the Spicy Pork Tostada. The nachos were delicious. The distinct flavor of the bulgogi integrated nicely with the classic Mexican nacho construction. I was quite impressed. My taco was also pretty darn good, packed full of shrimp (they don't skimp, thankfully) and flavored by a delicious white sauce. Needless to say, the somewhat grumpy disposition I had developed before walking into KoMex quickly subsided after the first few bites. \n\nFinal bill was around $17. A great bargain for the ton of food that we received.\n\nAmazing concept. Flawless execution. \nIf I were a local, I fear KoMex would become one of my regular haunts.
