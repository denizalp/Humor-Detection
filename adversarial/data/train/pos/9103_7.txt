My family moved into Rhodes Ranch a couple of months ago. It is a dream for stay at home moms such as myself. My son was pretty upset when we moved because he wouldn't be able to see his friends anymore, but in the 3 months we've lived here, we've managed to make friends with several families since many moms here stay at home as well. Everyday, we have to make the grueling decision of whether we should go on a walk, feed ducks by the golf course, go to the park, and soon, if we should go to the water park. We're also zoned for Forbuss which is rated as an A school, which is obviously important to families that have little ones who are about to go into elementary school. \n\nA huge bonus is that I feel very safe in the community. It is secured by security that take pictures of your license plate and check guests in. I can run at any time of the day or night as there are always people out and driving, I'm pretty sure I can't get smuggled into the back of a sketchy van without someone noticing. The route around the community is a nice running path that spans 2 miles and is actually quite pretty to look at. Just watch out for the bees in the Spring. \n\nI also love that if I want to go hit some golf balls, I don't have to leave my community! They have a golf range, a course, and a restaurant! The HOA also sets up cool get-togethers like toddler storytime and a carnival tomorrow! \n\nDown side is that the gate can get backed up bad down Durango some times. I remember when we were moving on Superbowl Sunday at 3PM, we waited for half an hour just to get in. \n\nOverall, pros severely outweigh the cons. If you're considering moving here with small kids, do it! Best decision of my life.
