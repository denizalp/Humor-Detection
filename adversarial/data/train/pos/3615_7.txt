After NUMEROUS attempts to eat here and enjoy a dinner - we give up! We are NEVER going back - its a joke.\nWHERE DO I START???\n\nEmpty restaurant - yet NO ONE serve you.\n\nMake you sit there and sit there for no apparent reason\n\nTHEN - send someone who cannot at ALL speak English to take an order which they botch over and over again.\n\nOVERPRICED BEYOND BELIEF!!   Unreal.\n\nSERVICE IS AWFUL - EVERYTIME - ALWAYS.  Slow, disappearing staff & forever to get your meal.\n\nFood - is mostly UNDERCOOKED not nicely grilled like one would like in a Teppanyaki place.  Loaded in butter - just fast food nonsense they charge 40.00 for.....\n\nBad attitude - when you complain - they get hissy fit with you and then vanish.....\n\nDO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY - this place is not worth HALF what they charge!!  \n\nConstant hassle and ruining of meals going here. WE ARE DONE.
