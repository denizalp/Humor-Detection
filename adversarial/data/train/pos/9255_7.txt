The Pittsburgh Skyline - that iconic view of downtown (mostly photographed from Mt. Washington) was once a hallmark of Pittsburgh, something at which was naturally beautiful to look now suffers from a scorching case of corporate herpes.\n\nI noticed this because today (Aug 17), Bing.com's homepage was a very old late evening photograph of downtown from Grandview Ave, complete with a full moon hovering slightly above and to the left of the USS Tower.\n\nFor those of you who don't know: Corporate Herpes is a condition caused by a city whoring out its skyline to the corporate dicks located within the city. Corporations leave their mark forever to be seen on the skyline in the form of logos or names. They scream out \"Yeah, I hit that!\" While everyone else is thinking, \"I DON'T CARE\".\n\nSo thanks to Highmark, UPMC, Reed Smith and other ambulance chasers, BNY Mellon and all others for overcompensating.
