I love Nature's Emporium.  This store is fantastic in just so many ways.  From it's great selection of products, to friendly and efficient staff this is my favourite Toronto supermarket.\n\nMy absolute favourite part of this store is their cheese section.  They have a wide range of cheeses from all over the world and it's a great collection.  Lot's of raw milk and organic cheeses.\n\nThe store itself is very clean and very well laid out.
