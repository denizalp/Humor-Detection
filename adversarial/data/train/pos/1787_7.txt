I didn't get to check in last night because signal was weak...\n\nHowever, Britney Spears was epic!! I couldn't have asked for a better show. I was in the right hand side mosh pit and the view was just amazing. I was able to see her dripping sweat as she danced on the stage.\n\nBritney knows how to please and hype up her fans.\n\nThis is a must see show!
