No Idea why this place has bad reviews?!!!\n\nI LOVED my stay. My girlfriend and I drove up last weekend from San Diego, to take a mini vacation\/get out of town. My girlfriend will find issues if they exist believe me, and she also was in love with this Resort\/Hotel. \n\nWhat a  breath of fresh air! (and tons of alcohol lol) Our rooms were SO nice! Even got a complimentary bottle of Champagne!  How cool are the bathrooms?! Rain showers, jacuzzi tub. The rooms btw are just RIDICULOUS beautiful. I seriously will never stay at another hotel after coming here (cant beat price.) We got the Deluxe Suite with a King bed, since its so inexpensive we figured why not get the larger room\/bed. We paid online so got 30% off. \n\nThe restaurant (Addiction) was delicious! I had the Fireball French Toast, sooo good! The Fish Taco's are great too. \n\nSuper good crowd. and not idiots\/obnoxious. I love that its directly across from the Hard Rock (my other favorite place in Vegas.) Steveo our bartender was SO friendly and cool to us. Makes a bomb Moscow Mule. Seriously loved how the treated us, and loved our rooms-cant recommend enough.
