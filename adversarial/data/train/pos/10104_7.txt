Pancho's Kitchen was recommended to me by a veteran vegan customer that I met in Simply Pure in Container Park. When she said \"vegan mexican food\" my jaw dropped. I didn't know there could be so many variations of vegan food! It's so great being able to still have that same flavor, but just with healthier alternatives.\nThis location just opened up last month. The interior of the restaurant is designed and decorated so nicely. It has that vibe as if I'm going to my best friend's mom's house for some tasty authentic mexican food - very homey and welcoming.\n\nThe hostess\/waitress I had was Lily and she was extremely kind and helpful. She checked up on my boyfriend and I many times to make sure that we were doing okay. \n\nI like that they give you an appetizer of chips and salsa, on the house. I ordered a vegan burrito with lime-cilantro mushroom and my boyfriend ordered from the regular menu - a burrito with al pastor meat. Yes, they are a little bit pricey, especially on the regular menu. A burrito with a side of chips is $10. But at the end of the meal, I still felt very full and content.
