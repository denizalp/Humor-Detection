Off to Vegas for a friends wedding, I knew that I wanted to \"go crazy\" and get another tattoo. Now, mind you, \"go crazy\" for me is research various Vegas tattoo parlors, print examples, schedule when to go, etc. etc. It's another form of crazy, right?\n\nI checked out Starlight in late 2008 while staying at Mandalay Bay, it was clean and cool but a little intimidating. I checked out the Yelp reviews in anticipation for this trip - not many, but favourable. So I decided to go with it.\n\nOf course, my friends had to come with me and tahdah, they all wanted to get tattoos too. \n\nWe first spoke to the piercing guy who was \"manning\" the front of the shop. He was knowledgeable and direct. I'm a bubbly person, he was not, but knew his stuff. I'm still a little intimidated, but I think it was more of a cultural thing. Did I really want them to be like \"OMG, like, awesome!?!\" \n\nSo, talk talk talk and we're on! 3 tattoos, discounted price, and discussions with the artist on one particularly detailed tattoo. They advised on size vs. amount of detail and realities of it all. My two friends got their's that same day, but I had to wait because I still had a wedding to go to. \n\nThe detailed tattoo, on the back, (Gundam... kudos if you know what that is) was done in about 4 hours. 2 hours on first day, then another 2 the 2nd day. This was because we had show tickets that evening, but it was nicer to break up the time anyways. The artist really took his time on this one, the shadow and colors are phenominal. \n\nThe 2nd tattoo was of a dragon on the calf. The artist advised my friend on doing a siloulette vs. the line drawing, and we are very happy with it. It took about an hour and a half, (mostly from shaving a very hairy guys leg)\n\nMine took about an hour, the Little Mermaid on my back shoulder. I had an image, and they made it better! It' still healing, but everyone is commenting on the vibrancy of the colors.\n\nAll together, I'd highly recommend it. I'm not an expert, but as an average tattooee, tattoo enthusiast, whatever, no regrets! \n\nP.S. Although I do regret not being able to get a chocolate eclair from the Chocolate Swan at the Mandalay Mall... it's gone and I had to settle for after-tattoo gelato. Sniff sniff.
