Too fuckin big. Jesus Christ I thought I would need a stretcher by the time I reached my gate. Security personnel are pretty hardcore. Don't look like you are having a good time, just remain somber and stare straight ahead. The \"random\" people they pulled from the line for additional searching seemed geared towards the loud still in party Vegas style mode people. Poor Bastards. I wasn't really feeling the slot machines in the Airport. People playing slots there seemed like they must have a gambling problem. Made me feel a little bad for people like that. Planes have always been on time and I made it in and out alive. What more can you ask for. Even hardcore Security workers have a job to do. \n\n1star for Security\n1star for Planes on time\n1star for Luggage never being lost.
