Went on Sunday 10-11-15 around 1:15 PM.  The place is just around the corner from SkinnyFATS next to the Sonic.  I've been wanting to try this place forever! \nThe store itself is contemporary and small.  There is seating for maybe 18-20 people.  It looks like they offer a very basic coffee and tea, and the stars of the show are the fancy pastries in a small case. They do have high chairs for the kiddos.  \n$6.22 got me a mont blanc and a cream puff for my boy.  My boy was thoroughly impressed with his cream puff and the mont blanc was delicious as it was beautiful.  I had always wondered what the little yellow thing on top was.  I had imagined it was maybe an apricot or a candied peach but no...it was a chestnut I think.  \nMy favorite part about the visit was the girl behind the counter.  She was adorable.  When I handed her my card she reached for it with both hands and then handed it back with both hands.  She arranged my items on a small tray, stepped back and took a look, and then re-arranged the items on the tray.  How thoughtful and utterly cute.
