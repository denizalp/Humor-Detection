Beautiful hotel!! It is kind of small but it has all the games you want to play.  \n\nWe signed up for the player cards and got $8 of play money. They said you have a chance to win up to $888 when you sign up on the player card.\n\nFood: we only tried the bao at the Bao station. 3 little baos for $6.  We did not see anything else we want to try because it is kind of pricey for most of the food items.\n\nService: everyone was very courteous and friendly.\n\nParking: plenty at the structure and free!\n\nI won $25 playing the penny machine.  It is a good sign for me to come back again.
