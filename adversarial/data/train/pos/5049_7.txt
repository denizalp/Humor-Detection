We stopped to check out Dos Gringos at the taco festival today. They only had two types of tacos available so we tried the both pork and chicken. I should have known it wasn't the best because there was literally no line compared to every other stand overflowing with people. We received them pretty quick, but they were already cold and did not look very appealing. My husband said his pork taco was ok. The chicken taco was pretty juicy but the hot sauce reminded me of something Taco Bell would sell. I was so bummed.
