The coolest part of the Secret Garden was seeing the dolphins from under water.  I was mesmerized watching this one dolphin circle round and round in the same pattern, passing by the window each time.  It looked like it was \"sleep-swimming\".  Pretty sweet!\n\nThe beef I have with the Secret Garden is the price--$15??? For this?? It's a *tiny* zoo with a couple of dolphin pools and a handful of cages for white tigers, leopards and alpacas.  I'd pay $5, but for $15, I was expecting much more.\n\nI went in the early afternoon and the animals were just lying there sleeping.  It was pretty boring.  I wouldn't come again, but I'm glad I at least got to see a dolphin up close from under water.  If you do go, I'd go earlier so that the cats are more active.\n\n*See pics*
