I think overall we had a great experience. I am new to the sushi world and therefor very picky about what I eat and where it comes from. My fiance's mom and dad also went with us. They have a resident sushi place in GIlbert and we were urging them to try this place. All I can say is that ALL of our expectations were met. The sushi was fantastic! The staff were so kind and polite. We went during happy hour and choose not to purchase the groupon. My favorite roll that our chef made was the Vegas roll, which surprised me because I am usually not a fan of them. I can guarantee you we will be back here again!
