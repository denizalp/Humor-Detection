MGM is ok I guess and navigating throughout the casino could have been thought out a lot better. In my opinion placing the floor map of the casino could have been in a better location such as when you first come in after parking your car, you have to find the map buried within the casino. Also they have a horrible potpourri smell in the lobby area and beyond. I'd advise if you have breathing issues or not really a custom to a very heavy fragrant to plant type materials I would try and avoid this area as much as you can, especially kids with breathing health issues.
