I won't come here again. \n\nTo me, Chipotle has become my own Fredo. \n\n\"I know it was you, Fredo. You broke my heart. You broke my heart!\"\n\nHow dare you use SYSCO! How dare you! \n\nI know you are using SYSCO. I know it, Chipotle! Don't lie to me.  \n\nYou said that you were better than others. You said you wouldn't do this. \n\n\"Chipotle's mission statement is called 'Food with Integrity' which states they source organic and local produce whenever possible [...]\"\n\nBullshit! \n\nIs the meat also SYSCO-meat? Is it Frankenmeat! You lied. Liar! \n\nYou have no integrity. No ethics. No shame. \n\nOne star.
