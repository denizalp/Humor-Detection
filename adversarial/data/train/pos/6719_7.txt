Food was great! My wife got her stuff first (ladies first) but ate it before mine arrived... would have been nice to eat togther... but it was good...\n\nGirl working was kinda grumpy... not much politeness... felt like we were an inconvenience to their night... We apologize for coming in for ice cream... it was a good idea for us..
