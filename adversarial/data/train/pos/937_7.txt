There lay in Mandalay Bay a burger bar...(1\/24)\n\n\nSo average, you will wonder why the hype. Amongst the cheering and yelling of the Colts and Jets fans, we (the burger bureau) took a seat at the bar to indulge in the \"finest\" burger in town. \n\nThe menu shows a lot of promise replete with choices of signature and build-your-own burgers. They suit all spenders ($14.00-$60.00 +). Plenty of liquids are also available to wash down your desired selections. \n\nI put in my order for the American Classic--sans cheese, picked up a side of Zucchini fries and elected for a mug root beer. \n\nThe Burger Breakdown: The American Classic shared the white oval plate with the Zucchini fries, a pickle and the fixings on the side. The fixings: a slice of raw onion, green-leaf lettuce and a slice of tomato. The burger was cooked to a perfect medium--yet desiccated. This was the first time I have encountered this anomaly. I was disappointed with the lack of jus (fats and oil that were missing). I reached for the root beer after every bite. Yikes. The zucchini fries were well seasoned and made up for this average burger. The burger was fair sized but only fair-flavored.\n\nThe presentation was lack-luster and the meal could be described in one word: LACKING. In an otherwise unforgettable trip to Las Vegas, I cannot wait to let this burger slip from my mind.\nWhile the selection was plentiful, the choices fell flat across this Burger Bar.
