I think all of their sandwiches are pretty terrible. They're bland, small, and have an odd texture. I tend to feel awful if I eat their sandwiches. Their fries however are probably my favorite fries from any fast food joint. My boyfriend and I have actually grabbed some of their fries to go but pick up sandwiches elsewhere. Lol so they get 3 stars for the yummy fries!!
