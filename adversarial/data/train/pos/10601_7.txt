I love this mini mall attached to the Planet Hollywood Hotel especially if you're a shopper like me. \n\nMy girlfriend Diane was here visiting and we spent the day on the strip shopping and walking.  Since they no longer have La Salsa in Phoenix I always bring her here to La Salsa at this mall to enjoy the shrimp tacos and a Corona.  They have a  pseudo patio set-up (you are actually indoors near the fountain) and it's nice to sit and have a quick cheap lunch.  According their website they have 15 places to eat here.  From pizza, hamburgers, pub food, Panda Express, Cabo Wabo and many other cheap eats including a Lobster place which I am dying to check out.\n\nLots of affordable stores here too so if you're in a pinch and need a pair of nice shoes there are plenty of places here to shop.  I love Aldo's, Baker's, Guess, Sephora, ABC store and they have a H&M store here too.  There's a great accessory store with prices starting at $10 for awesome faux bling and a tattoo place with a window for viewing.  Sugary Factory for cute gifts or to buy that needy teenager a celebrity $25 lollipop with rhinestones.\n\nIt's dark and you can get lost easily.  There's a few other places to eat here too like the Lobster Me place which I will try next time I'm here.
