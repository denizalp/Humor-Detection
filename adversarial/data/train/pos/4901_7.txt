I have a bad experience before at a location downtown sadly this was no better \n\nI hate to complain \n\nBut I always check in on yelp I guess it was a free margarita when you check in I sat my phone down I was in a convo with a friend the waitress walked up said free margarita I replied yes is that ok if I use this she picked up my phone and also wrote a tip saying \"Jessi rocks\" ITS NOT APPROPRIATE TO PICK UP MY PHONE AND WRITE THAT!!!! She said it looks good for the owners \n\nWe were suppose to have a big party it ended up just being three of us ....: she walked around with her son on her back giving him piggy back rides not sure how that is professional?????????? also sat down at our table a few times saying she was pregnant ???? I'm not sure how your waitress \"Jessi\" thinks this is appropriate \n\nThe only good point was our nachos were yummy \n\nShe left out table full of dishes???? She also came back and asked what my drink I'm not sure what was going on but this is my second bad review at a different location how horrible!!!\n\nOh and the bathrooms are DISGUSTING
