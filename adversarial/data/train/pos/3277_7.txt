We were lucky enough to attend the \"Friends & Family\" pre-opening event with our friends. The moment you walk into Zuma, the experience is beyond amazing! The restaurant design and decor is breathtaking. The service is impeccable. The food and drinks are \"wow\" level. \n\nWe started at the bar and it was mesmerizing watching the bartenders work passionately to make their signature craft cocktails. The Geisha Smash is the drink to get. We had 3! Smooth and all the flavors balanced perfectly. I also had a signature drink that was comparable to a Salty Dog, I forget the drink name, and it was a cloudy pink drink that was quite tasty as well.\n\nWe tried a bit of everything on the food menu and we got a good variety. I don't think we had a bad dish in the bunch, and we had many different dishes. I apologize as I don't remember all details of the menu items but can label accordingly once the menu is posted. My favorites were the thinly sliced sea bass with salmon roe, king crab, hot pot mushroom rice, lobster, corn on the cob, soft shell crab sushi, branzino, passion fruit dessert, molten chocolate dessert. So many delicious dishes. I don't think you can really go wrong with anything here.\n\nAll in all, we had a very memorable experience and I am so impressed with everything here at Zuma. We may have to get a group together so we can use the group dining area in the back for the view! Thank you to the entire team at Zuma for a lovely night. We really enjoyed everything!
