Went here today because I missed the OCT 2015 International Supper Club Unofficial Yelp Event (UYE).  Norm R was right.  This place has the best Pho in Phoenix. \n\nThis place is situated in a nondescript strip mall of Asian inspired shops.  I have literally passed it a dozen times and have never noticed it.  \n\nit looks like a bingo hall on the inside with these tables with numbers on them.  Fluorescent lights lining the drop ceiling and rectangle folding (-like) tables with 6 or 8 chairs at most of them.\n\nThe Pho is relatively inexpensive.  I didn't realize, ordering the oxtail Pho, that I was ordering one of the most expensive things on the menu at $12.  I am one of those weirdos who order Pho for the broth and the beef.  I'm indifferent about the noodles and rarely eat much of them.  The broth here is the best I've had in Phoenix.   This was a warm treat on a chilly rainy day. \n\nThe place was packed too.  I was surprised, but then maybe not.  It was a rainy cool day in PHoenix.  Who wants to be out?  Apparently others had the same thoughts as I, let's get Pho!\n\nReturn factor: 90%
