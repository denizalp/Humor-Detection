I really enjoyed the pizza, but wish that there was more of a variety of pizzas to choose from (1 vegan, 2 red, and 2 white).  I liked their sauce.  It's too bad that it's only on two different pizzas that I would order (I'm not going the \"no cheese\" route).  I don't anticipate coming back very often unless I'm in the mood for a margherita.  Kind of a shame.
