You know how they say dress for the job you want?  In vegas, it's gamble for the casino you want.  Casinos offer great room deals to people who gamble there--so every dollar you gamble is an opportunity to get those free\/cheap rooms.  That was my mentality when I sat down at the cosmopolitan and never stood up.  As a new identity club member, I had to get to 1,000 points in 48 hours to win two free buffets.\n\nChallenge, accepted.\n\nI got a horrible cold but that didn't stop me from hitting those slot machines--all in readiness for that buffet.  When celebration time came, oh boy, did we celebrate.  I am a vegetarian, so I have to say that I couldn't eat a lot of the foods.  However, there was plenty that I could eat.  I ate: Mashed potatoes (amazing), wicked mac and cheese (OMG), tortellini pesto (yes), waldorf salad, cheeses, mushroom polenta, and more that I cannot think of.  So great.\n\nThen--dessert.  I am not normally a huge dessert person but omg, did i die.  I died.  I had candy bar gelato in the little waffle cone, red velvet cookie, oreo covered chocolate strawberry, blueberry lemon cheesecake (eh).  \n\nI really loved how everything was pre-plated small plates.  A lot of the foods I only had one to two bites of so I still ended up leaving over but still.  Nothing is more gross than a regular bffet where little kids are picking their noses and then touching the same spoon as you.\n\nReally, quite delicious.  I have only been to two other vegas buffets (Aria and Luxor), but this one really takes the cake (literally. i took all the cake)
