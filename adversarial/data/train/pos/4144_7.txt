Ok. First things first. The other reviews both bothered to point out the sketchy location of George's Chicken. It's true, it's on one of the bad corners in Cabbagetown -- but that's the beauty of this hood: where millionaires and crackheads collide in a perfect (and SAFE) harmony.\n\nThe chicken is good, the fries and gravy are great, the sides are cheap and average. Basically, you can get something here that is WAY better and half of the price of Swiss Chalet or KFC. \n\nI'll be back! Cluck cluck.
