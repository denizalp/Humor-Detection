Delicious Jamaican food in the city! Coming here around 12pm on a weekday, there were no lines when we came in, but the patio grew to be quite popular throughout the meal.\n\nIt's beautifully decorated inside, with cute clipboard menus for us to read. For four people, we decided to share a few of the dishes, in total we spent around $25 per person for a lunch. After ordering, we were given two of their special house sauces for spice - one was a mango flavoured one which was less spicy, the red spice was a little more hot.\n\nThe portions come in very small sized bowls - rather small for the amount that you pay for in comparison to out of city restaurants. The likkle bites appetizers can be quite pricey as well, but the quality of the food is very tasty. \n\nPepper Shrimp ($16)\n- There were about 6 pieces of large shrimp, peeled for you in garlic sauce. The shrimps were really juicy and delicious, with delicious flavouring for the sauce. \n\nSlow-baked Jerk Wings ($16)\n- Delicious sauce, the wings were split up into wings and drumsticks for those who had a preference for one over another. Less than 10 pieces in total\n\nFried Okra ($6)\n- Really delicious way of eating okra! I am typically not a big fan of okra, but the way they made it here was very delicious!\n\nCurry Goat with jasmine rice ($17)\n- The curry goat was delicious with their tasty mango chutney sauce! I could taste a bit of the smell from the goat, but the curry covered a bit of the smell already. If you're a regular jasmine rice eater (which I am), this jasmine rice is a little more rough than other grains that I have tasted. \n\nJerk Chicken - quarter with Chubby's Slaw ($16)\nThe jerk chicken was probably my favourite dish here. I wouldn't say it's the best jerk chicken that I've had though, there wasn't enough flavour to it in my opinion. The chubby slaw mixture of slaw veggies in a small bowl. Nothing amazing about it in particular, just a typical bowl of slaw that you can find at the supermarket.\n\nRice and Peas ($5)\nOf course, we had to order this to go along with the jerk chicken!
