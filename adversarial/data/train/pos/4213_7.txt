I would not even put one star but you at least have to pick one. My gosh, bad, bad mistake taking my unit there. Stay on top of your repair for he'll own it after 30 days. Its the first thing he makes you sign! I think that is the mission after all. I haven't been so upset with an outcome in a long time. Strange free estimate, all over the place repair plan and failure to keep in touch gives this shop ZERO stars. Thanks for ruining the karaoke party sir. Arrrghh!
