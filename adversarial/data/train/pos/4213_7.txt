Found this all-day breakfast location on yelp and decided to check it out with a friend.\n\nThe restaurant is hidden in a plaza -- and to be honest, from the outside, it comes off as very plain; however, when you step into the establishment, it is very aesthetically-pleasing! It definitely reminds me of the many cute cafes in Seoul, South Korea -- and to no surprise, I am pretty sure the owners are Korean (since the whole staff is).\n\nThe food is well-priced, and although we went for breakfast, we hung out until just around the lunch hour -- and their lunch food looks delicious! \n\nSo why not 5 stars? For 3 eggs, my scrambled eggs came out to a very small portion -- but I guess it's probably because they used regular-sized eggs, as opposed to extra-large eggs, which really isn't a big deal.\n\nI will definitely be returning to try their lunch menu!
