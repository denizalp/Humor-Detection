This place is beautiful on the outside but once you live here and experience all the ghetto people who live here and blast their music all hours of the day and night then you'll know you made a mistake to be paying such a high rent to live in the ghetto!  Not only that the building are cheaply built with paper thin walls. I can hear the neighbors conversations and all everything else they do. The quality of the fixtures are so badly built that my kitchen sink fell out of the counter top the day before Christmas. It took them 3 months to fix it. My bathroom light fixture broke and it took them another 3 months to fix it. Management is always changing because they can't handle the stress of working here. You can hear the freeway noise all day and all night. Neighbors smoke weed on the balconies and throw their trash over the the side.  People walk their pit bulls without leash. One pitbull attacked my wife and dog because it wasn't on a leash and the owner thought it was funny!  This place is a fucking nightmare!  I beg anyone who is considering on living here to find someplace else!!!   You will regret living here!!!!
