My girlfriend and I went to Vegas 2 weekends ago and my timeshare gave us 2 tickets for Bite.  We got there 5min late, and they sat us all the way in the front.  Any closer and I would require cookies for the milk I was about to suckle.  I could have done without the vampire and singer dudes.  All the girls were good looking and their boobs were nice (on the smaller side, but boobs are boobs and I loves them all).  The guy and girl that hang from the ceiling were awesome and have to be great athletes.  Unfortunately, when my girlfriend took a pic with the female cast afterward, they had shirts on.  If it hadn't been free, I would have asked for my money at that instant.  ALL HAIL THE BOOBIES!!!
