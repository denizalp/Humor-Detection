My brother gets a great deal because he has a players card from here. For $30\/day it was cheap enough for my lean pockets. We get adjoining rooms on the 19th floor, non-smoking. The rooms were clean enough, although I could still smell the cigarette smoke wafting from the elevators just a few steps away. It's one of my pet peeves of hotels with casinos, you can never get the smell of cigarettes out. Plus you have to go through the casino to get to the hotel anyways so there's really no escaping that. Anyhoo this time we get the room with a view of the mountains and old town Vegas. It was cool too, but last time we were here we had a view of the strip. That was super nice. \n\nWith the room key you get a free pass to the observation deck ($18 value) and with the players card you get 10% off at the buffet and Roxy's diner. I'm not sure if they offer it at the Italian restaurant. They have Top of The World restaurant here (reviewed separate on its business site).\n\nThe restrooms are clean and maintained well, frequently stocked with supplies. \n\nParking is adequate but if you're like me I love to park on the 3rd floor, coz that's where the bridge to the casino is. I don't mind driving around and around until I get one close by =P.
