It's a fun place to go and browse, but definitely very heavy Asian lean, like half the store. \nRest of the world has more or less dedicated aisles and select products in dairy\/freezer section, but overwhelming majority is Asian products. \n Aisles are super crammed and organization is a little iffy- same brand of corned beef is pretty much is every aisle and middle of the store, lol. It's almost like they tried to do a one stop shop for every ethnicity. Slow moving patrons (like me) make it a little challenging to freely move down tiny aisles. \n Prices are competitive on seafood, for sure, and I enjoyed their selection of fresh mushrooms. Rest of prices seem to be slightly higher than what I usually see at other ethnic markets like Jones, my go to Russian spot. \n It is a membership store- not like card you at the door style, but at checkout either you pay 5% premium, or you need to have a membership card ($10\/annually). \n Glad I checked it out, might return for seafood and some produce. Not a one stop shop, by any means, nor is it ideal for European products.
