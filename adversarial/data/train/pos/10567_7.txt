Very disappointed as there are some great reviews for this place. We were not  impressed. I ordered the noodle soup with beef. The noodles were fairly doughy, beef was not very lean with large areas of gristle and fat and the broth was fairly bland as was the overall flavor in general. We also ordered noodles with seafood. The white sauce was akin to \"Campbell's Cream of\" soup. Our waiter was unfriendly and borderline rude. \n   Atmosphere was cold and unwelcoming, will definitely not be returning.
