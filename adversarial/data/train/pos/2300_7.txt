By far the best AYCE I have been to. Hands down best speciality rolls that I have ever tried. I'm not really big on Nigiri but from what I saw the rice ratio is like basically non-existent. The fish over powered the rice in all the rolls, no doubt about it! Now, for a small girl like me I love how there's minimal rice because I want to be able to eat as much as possible and let's face it, rice is extremely heavy & makes you full faster. \n\nFor rolls we got-- call 911, burn your ass roll, monkey brains, summer crunch, popcorn lobster roll, lemon salmon roll, \"the shit\", and jalapeño bomb roll. We also got beef skewer and lobster bacon skewer. \n\nI really did LOVE LOVE all the rolls I tried but My favorite roll was probably the Call 911 roll. It contained habanero so it's suppose to be extremely spicy. Yah it was spicy but it was the perfect amount. Chef Sy came out and even warned us that it was going to be the spiciest roll and to try not to call 911! LOL he was a good character. He came out and chatted a little bit with us. \n\nJalapeño bomb roll is another must get. It's a deep fried roll with cream cheese, crab & spicy tuna. There's a jalapeño on top that gives it an extra kick. Soooo good!! \n\nThere was an item called \"the shit\". It was part of the appetizer menu. It doesn't have a description but just says you must try it! So I do wanna say.. YOU MUST TRY IT! It's really good. It comes with this delicious sauce you eat it with. To die for! \n\nI really did wanna try more items but my stomach always fails me! I was so darn full! I will for sure be returning! There were dinner items on there that I really wanted to try like the \"rice less\" rolls! And the seafood salad. So next time I will be doing dinner AYCE.\n\nDessert -- green tea panna cotta and mango mochi. Green tea panna cotta is kinda like a flan but not as sweet. It is pretty good. \n\nThe staff were very efficient on taking our orders and filling our drinks. I think the waiter was a little overwhelmed though because he kept bringing us items that we did not order. But I'm not upset about it, the food made up for anything mediocrely bad that happened. \n\nHighly recommended! Everyone must go now!
