(Lyrics - The Lonely Island - Dick in a Box)\n\nYou know you've been there for such a long long time\nAnd now I'm ready to wait for it in the line\nWell, you know it's Lunch time and my mouth is open wide\nHope you gonna give me something tasty so you know what's on my mind\n\nA burger real special, so take off the bun\nI'll take a look inside it's at the Chuck Box!\nIt's at the box\n\nNot gonna get me a Burger King\nThat sort of burger don't mean anything\nNot gonna get me a In-and-Out\nCause, you've got my shining Yelp star\n\nNot gonna get me a Mckey burger\nI guy like me needs something real\nI wanna get me something that'll hit my heart\nSomething special man!\n\nIt's at the Chuck Box\nIt's at the Chuck Box man\nIt's at the Chuck Box\nOhh, It's at the Chuck Box man\n\nWhere should I start!?  Hmmm...\n\nWell I was told to come here years ago from a friend, but never traveled my way down to the Mills Ave. much anymore since I'm way past my 20's.  However, it was always on my mind and now; Bam! I did it!  \n\nThe Chuck Box I guess has been around for ages, not my age apparently.  The place itself is a dive.  Made out to look like it's right out of a pioneer wagon with boxes as chairs.  Seating is limited so arrive and be prepared to wait or pickup and go.  The burgers are made from scratch literally.  It's a \"build your own burger\" place so add toppings by asking the chef.  Overall, the burger is perfect.  Best firewood grill burger I've had!  Mesquite firewood is what they used. The burger is nice and juicy with a smokey scent!  I went lightly on the toppings since the burger itself is so big!  Ordered me a side of zucchini fries and I'm golden!  \n\nIn the end, I can be a burger snob, but The Chuck Box impressed me.  I don't care for \"build your burger\" places, but I'll let this one pass with an A grade. - Enjoy
