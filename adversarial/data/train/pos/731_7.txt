When it comes to legitimate cheesesteak here in town we all pretty much head to Pops. I remember Straight From Philly Steakout from back in the day (used to be where Pops is now) and after eating here recently I remembered why they faded from the spotlight years ago. This place would draw long lines and people raved about the cheesesteak and then the quality started to decline and the lines did too. Not sure they will ever capture the attention they once did especially with Pops nearby. I used the drive thru and the girl who took my order wasn't friendly at all. She made me feel like I was bothering her by ordering a sandwich. When I first unwrapped the pastrami sandwich it looked so good there was a good amount of meat filled nicely inside the bread. The pastrami was a disappointment with very little flavor and the meat  was thin and gristly. If you base your pastrami on places known for it like The Hat (cali) or The Hut (AZ) the pastrami here will definitely not be up to your standards. The cheesesteak I had was so bad. Seriously the meat was flavorless and the grease was everywhere and it was a complete waste of money. The owner doesn't take feedback well here on yelp and instead just wants to believe their way is the right way. It to me tasted like they bought a case of Steak-umms from Sam's Club and threw it on the grill. I am shocked to see the way they respond to some of the yelp reviews on here. It's like Rambo's Kitchen rants all over again lol. I'd rather give my hard earned money to Pops where I have never been treated so badly for just ordering a sandwich and where the food is worth the money because I personally did not find that here.
