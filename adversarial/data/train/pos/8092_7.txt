Average, but I wouldn't suggest this place. Is that would probably make it less than average. The food and tea is fine, but for the non-wow factor, the prices don't match up. For this kind of pricing, go down the street to Spring Villa! \n\nThe inside, on a quick glance, looks like those fancified Chinese banquets but this is an illusion. Tinsel to everyone's gold leaf. Plastic to everyone's crystal. If wanted fancified dimsum with average food, just go Premiere ballroom or Casa Victoria! \n\nIf I'm back again, it'll be at the request of the family, not my own recommendation!
