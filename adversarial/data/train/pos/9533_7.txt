Staying at the Delano on a Monday night in December, you will find many of the fine dining places closed Sunday-Tuesday. Was trying to eat and get a drink at Skyfall lounge, their top floor restaurant at the Delano. Alas, it was closed. \n\nGoing out to Mandalay Bay from the Delano, is their shopping area. Right when you get up there, this place is the first place you see from the escalator. What a great find!\n\nThe main attraction are the bartenders. Jason is a top notch guy that can make some awesome whiskey cocktails! I must had the best whiskey cocktails ever there. There take of an old fashion with Apple bitters takes the cake. Smoke whisky drink was fantastic. NY sour was good too, although I've had better ones. \n\nThe food ain't bad either with perfectly shucked oysters and need to come back to try more of their food. \n\nGood happy hour specials too for those that want to dine here before Michael Jackson One Event.
