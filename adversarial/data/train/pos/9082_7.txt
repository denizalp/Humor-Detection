The pizza isn't the greatest in the world, but it will do....especially when it's all you can eat for $7!  My friend lives around the corner, so he recommended coming here for lunch.\n\nI didn't know what to expect, but was happy to find a really clean place.  The restaurant was about 1\/2 full during lunchtime on a Tuesday.  On the buffet line you will find at least 12 to 15 different pizzas.  Since I love Pizza and can eat it morning, noon, and night I was in heaven.  I was about to screw up all of my efforts from the morning workout.\n\nHere's a list of what I can remember eating...the slices are small, so it's not as much as it appears...although it was a lot!\n\nPepperoni - Regular Crust\nPepperoni - Thick Crust\nPepperoni - Thin Crust\nPepperoni & Jalapenos\nMacaroni & Cheese - Yes, it's a pizza!  It was just ok though.\nHam & Cheese\nVeggie Thin Crust\nMushroom & Pepperoni\nPepperoni & Sausage\n\nThere were many others that I didn't try.....BBQ Chicken, Hawaiian, and several I can't remember.  Overall, it was great value for the money.\n\nThe people who work here are very friendly too.  They greeted everyone who entered the door & everyone who left.....and it sounded sincere not fake.\n\nThere was a small selection of video games & other games in the back room and tv's.\n\nWill I come back?  When I want to gain 500 lbs....yes!
