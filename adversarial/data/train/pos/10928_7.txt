I transferred to Odyssey my sophomore year and graduated with honors in 2009. I was never someone that thrived in the typical classroom environment especially with teachers that did not care. They didn't care so why should I right? That is not the case with Odyssey the teachers and staff truly care and want to see you succeed and will do what they can to help. They offered one on one sessions on top my scheduled day and those sessions with Dr Thatcher are the only reason I passed geometry. I really enjoyed having the freedom of being able to get ahead in my classes if I chose to and the ability to take extra classes on top of my normal schedule.
