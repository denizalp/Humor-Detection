One of my new obsessions are Macarons. They are NOT called Macaroons, those are the English coconut version but \"Macaron\" the French version. They come in different colors and flavors like pistachio, strawberry and lemon. The little cookies are light and fluffy like little pillows with a burst of flavor and chewy in the center. \n\nPayard's Macarons come in a little variety pack of about 6; pistachio, strawberry, lemon, orange and chocolate. My favorite flavors were strawberry and pistachio. I practically ate the entire bag in one sitting. Thank God, we got a second bag for breakfast! ;) \n\nDefinitely worth trying these little pieces of heaven.
