This place is terrible. Went in for flu symptoms & never once did the front desk explain this was an ER copay - $200 more than my urgent care copay. Once finally seen the Dr. tells me he tested positive for the flu. So make me wait an hour and then tell me I can leave and go to another place??  I have a temperature and am not feeling well do you really think I want to wait all over again??? That should have been mentioned before I made the decision to be seen there. So unprofessional. Since there set up is much like an urgent care they should clarify the copay before people agree to see a doctor, esp in non emergency situations. Less than impressed.
