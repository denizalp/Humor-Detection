This place is WAY bigger than it appears from outside!  I needed lemongrass and kaffir lime leaves for hot & sour soup.  I got that.  Along with baby bok choy, curry paste, Piknik snacks and a couple of other things.\nProduce aisle isn't all labeled, so I had to ask for help.  They didn't have the lime leaves out.  The little man found me in another part of the store with a package of them.  \nThere are aisles and aisles of all sorts of Oriental foods.  I could have spent a couple of hours in there exploring, but wasn't feeling so hot.  That's why I wanted to make the soup in the first place.\nStrange odor near produce section, but I don't question those sorts of things.  \nSpent $10 and walked out with a big bag o' stuff.
