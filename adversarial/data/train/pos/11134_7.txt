I think Rave has become my favorite movie house again. Temporarily anyway.\n\nThe reason? Reserved seating. And for the same price as a regular ticket. Gone are the days of having to arrive early and wait in line to assure yourself a good seat. No. For The Avengers last night, I merely purchased our tickets at the kiosk outside a few days earlier. I picked a trio of seats in row K on the right side of the middle section. And not a moment too soon--there weren't a whole lot of seats left in the middle section.\n\nGranted, there were people in our seats when we arrived. Then again, we didn't arrive until almost exactly midnight. It wasn't a big deal. They had to move. It's not rocket science. (I'll give them the benefit of the doubt and perhaps it wasn't explained).\n\nNow, if only Rave served shawarmas.
