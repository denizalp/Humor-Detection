Did I enter an alternate Twilight Zone universe? Did I visit the same store you other Yelpers have raved over? These high star ratings can't possibly be accurate. Based on these rave reviews, I made a special trip to check this place out -- and it is one of the worst stores I've ever been to!\n\nFirst off, it's an absolute disaster area inside. Junk piled EVERYWHERE. In the floor, on shelves, stacked on top of each other. This is a huge fire hazard and an accident just waiting to happen. I stumbled over several items that were just sticking out right in the middle of the floor. Use extreme caution when shopping here. \n\nSecond, the prices are NOT CHEAP. I was looking for some bargain prices on slightly used \/ returned \/ one of a kind merchandise and what I found instead were prices that were close to or even HIGHER than retail! What the heck? All I can surmise is that these glowing reviews are from people who simply never shop and just don't know their retail prices on items. \n\nA good third of the merchandise in the store had no marked price but it's not like you can take the item up to the counter and ask them what it costs -- if you tried to pick up an item, it would likely alter the stack of junk and cause an avalanche of crap to fall down on your head.\n\nLet me be perfectly clear -- I am NOT a snobby shopper. I frequent thrift stores, love yard sales, and am a loyal fan of clearance shops like Big Lots. I love a good bargain and I love hunting for deals, but the Liquidation Center is a complete waste of your time.
