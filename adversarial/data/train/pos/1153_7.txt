Why why why can't there be an Earl of Sandwich where I live :( :( \n\nEarls is a must if you are in the same city of a location because they are so sparse, the only other location I have been to is in Downtown Disney in CA. There are a ton of locations in Florida but that doesn't do me much good. I once drove by one at 3:00am on the way to Miami but it was closed!!! Anyways I have been here three times now, but this past time was special because I was sober enough to fully enjoy the sandwich! LOL Not to say that Earls isn't good drunk food, because trust me, it is!\n\nThis particular location is located at Planet Hollywood right when you walk in. Stop walking past in hopes you will find something else, you won't. This is as good as it gets for fast cheap excellent food. The first sandwich I ever tried was the Earl's Club and I cannot steer away from it. Recently I added avocado and WOWZER, took me to an entire new level. The bread and sauce make the sandwich here, the way they slow toast it makes it so yummy!!\n\nPLEASE OPEN A EARL OF SANDWICH IN THE SOUTH BAY!! \/begging.
