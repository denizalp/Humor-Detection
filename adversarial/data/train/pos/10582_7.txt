It was totally empty to begin with but that's okay went in for lunch with my daughter we were excited to try a new Greek restaurant! And we ordered several different dishes to share and one by one they got worse and worse we both think the health department needs to be contacted there was rancid walnuts in our salad the oil and vinegar bottle was covered with hair and dust like its been sitting for ever I have no idea what they do in that kitchen but it was disgusting to stay the very least! We started looking around and it  was very very dirty...  We had to send back even the salad which smelt like dirty sponges maybe they dryer the lettuce leaves off with a used wet towel in the kitchen...  it was so gross .We will never go back cannot even imagine that they're even still open!!!! :(\nEXTREMELY  DISAPPOINTED! !!
