Not the worst hotel I've stayed in but kinda close.  I should have known better, after booking the room for $129\/night.  My husband said that you should never get a room cheaper than $200\/night in Vegas and I think he's right.\n\nWhen we checked in here, we immediately noticed the...ahem...lack of class in the clientele.  My sinuses started acting up on our way up to our room.  Our room smelled of mold and the furniture looked like it hadn't been updated since the '70s.  The wallpaper in the bathroom was peeling and there were stains in the carpet.  The bedding was very threadbare.  We tried to get internet access but they have this ridiculous system where you supposedly sign in with your credit card and agree to pay for it but then they refund you the money once you check out...yeah, sounded like a scam to us too.\n\nWe immediately walked across the street and booked a room at Bellagio.  Yes, it was more than 3 times as much as Bally's but well worth it.
