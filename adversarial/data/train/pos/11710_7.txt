C's school was having a family dinner night fundraiser. Since BJ's is just outside of the mall near the theater, parking can be a pain. Luckily C & I found parking within a few passes.\nBJ's is a large restaurant with a menu that offers something for everyone. We had a short wait to be seated, maybe 10 minutes. \nOur server didn't introduce himself. He brought drink refills when needed but was absent most of the meal.\nC ordered the kids 6\" deep dish pizza. Fruit salad as a side. Our server informed us that the pizza did not come with a side like the other kid's meals. C likes fruit so I said fine, add on the side of fruit. C liked his pizza but not the chunks of tomatoes that were all over it. I ate them. C said the crust was a bit sweet, like Old Chicago's, but it was an ok mini pie. The fruit bowl was a joke. Cubed watermelon with 3 grapes. Pathetic.\nI ordered the Bacon-Guacamole Deluxe; Guacamole, Smoked Bacon, Pepper Jack Cheese, Chipotle Mayo, Red Onions, Jalapenos & Tomatoes. The burger was cooked right. The chipotle mayo was pretty lame. Not a whole lot of flavor. Overall, it was a decent burger and the side of fries were quite tasty.\nOK service, lousy fruit side, decent burger & fries, not a very attentive server. 3 Stars
