horrible service, boyfriend was yelled at twice because he did not want to eat the rice with the nigiri sushi.  So he only ate the fish and not the rice and the waitress comes running over yelling at him very loud in front of the entire restaurant that he can't do that then did it again. If I order a burger and dont want to eat the bun you cant tell me that I can't do that.  I finally the second time asked her to please stop yelling at us and to get away that if he does not want to eat the rice he does not have to..  If you need to charge us al la carte fine but leave us alone and stop being rude.  She then proceeded to yell in Japanese to the other waitress for 15 minutes.  we had to ask for our check and wait for another 10 minutes while she yelled in Japanese about us.  the sushi was just ok the sushi chefs very nice but the wait staff was absolutely rude and horrible and I will never recommend this to anyone.  She could have simply said if you do not eat the rice we will have to charge you al la carte pricing.  I am not a child and dont appreciate being yelled at while trying to enjoy dinner while everyone stares at us in the restaurant.   Wish Yelp would finally start a zero star rating somehow
