So I'm picking my wife up at the airport and remember she's been planing around for 6 hours and will probably be way hungry and I don't know where to get good food near here.\nso I ask the lady at hourly parking: Pinky's she says, 10 minutes away she says, does great burgers she says... so I get there and ask what's the two most popular burgers they sell. \"White Trash burger\" and \"Patsy Melt\" - 'Oy! cute names,' I think and prepare to be underwhelmed, but the place smells good, and there's pin ball, and I'm already here, so one of each plus onion things.\nGot back to CLT on time to meet my wife at baggage claim and we thoroughly enjoyed the simple goodness of onion strings and fried pickles on a cheese burger plus more onion strings...\nHad that P-melt cold for breakfast with a coke- oh yeah!!
