Paper Root Studio is a nice little paper and journal shop within the Eau Claire Market.  This place has been around awhile and I manage to stop in whenever I'm in Town. I'll buy a thoughtful card, a journal, or may a small  tchotchke gift for a friend. I also love the name as I used to have 2 Paper Routes for the Estherville Daily News and Des Moines Register back in Iowa.
