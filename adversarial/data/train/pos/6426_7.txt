I was here last Friday night celebrating my birthday and my friend's birthday.  We had a table reserved in the Ling Ling Club and had absolutely no issues getting in.  I could see how people could be confused - but this is a new place and they are still working out the kinks.  I think most of you might not remember when some of the other, popular clubs opened - they had tons of issues as well, and time has fixed that.  Give Hakkasan a chance and everything will be fine.\n\nI am also pretty easily entertained, but I don't have a lot of patience....neither was a problem that night.  We were escorted to our table (a corner booth) in the Ling Ling Club, which was surprisingly crowded for 11pm at night.  I've seen a lot of complaints about there being nowhere to stand if you don't have a table - well I saw a bunch of people with plenty of room to stand (in the aisle).\n\nWe had an absolute BLAST!  Our server and busser were awesome and provided great service, security was very nice and the music was bumpin!  There was nothing \"ghetto\" about the music - have you ever listened to hip hop before?  The DJ played a good mix of current and old school music and our group danced our butts off.\n\nWe did not explore the rest of the club, because we were happy where we were at, and EDM is not really my thing , so I can't really speak about the rest of the club.  But I am REALLY happy that Hakkasan offers something for hip hop lovers.  The crowd that night seemed to all enjoy themselves (but probably came here to write bad reviews later...), and I consider the night a success.\n\nThe only negative thing I would say is that it is not a good idea to have the stairs as the main exit at the end of the night.  There were a lot of intoxicated people, and it makes for an interesting departure when you try to get down the stairs in your heels after a few cocktails.  Other than that, it's a beautiful space!
