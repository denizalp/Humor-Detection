This is a great little place to buy some super fresh fish to take away and grill at home or enjoy at their restaurant.\n\nI went with their Thai peanut bowl which was delicious.  Plenty of tuna and other mildly spicy ingredients in a bowl with soba noodles.  $12 dollars was a very fair price given the quality of the ingredients.\n\nThe owner, John, was very friendly and helpful.  I can't wait to try some of the other menu items and their upcoming special dining events.
