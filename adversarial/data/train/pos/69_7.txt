Went there for the first time last week as I am new to Charlotte. Clean, new space in a strip mall. The woman who took appointments was very friendly and they kept their appointment time exactly, which is not always the norm at some places.\n\nHad a consultation with the colorist and stylist,  both very pleasant, so they could learn what I was looking for in a style: Low maintenance, not too suburban Mom and, as I am going gray, highlights that are not high contrast.\n\nBut I also said, and this may be the problem, \"You are the color expert, I defer to your judgement.\" Bad idea.\n\nWhat I walked out with had nothing to do with what I said I wanted. I now have an unflattering dark purple-ish color, which I had thought would be a highlight (for \"depth\") and instead is the all- over color. \n\nAlso, when I got home my scalp was really itchy and so I washed my hair.  I had to spend 10 minutes just rinsing and rinsing. It looked like the shower seen from Psycho, and I ended up ruining a towel and a t-shirt which the dye transferred to.  They left a LOT of dye on my head. And the style takes a fair bit of torturing and product to make it reasonable.\n\nThe two ladies could tell I was taken aback with the result. They both were concerned and offered to make changes the next time I came in. Except there won't be a next time.\n\nHaving spent $200, I was frosted when I left. And yet, idiot that I am, I still tipped well.
