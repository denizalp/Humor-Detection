If I said I love chocolate, that would be incorrect. My affinity, infatuation, and appreciation for chocolate cannot be properly described with the simple word \"love.\" \n\nLet me put it this way, if teeth deterioration and diabetes did not exist, I'd have chocolate for breakfast, lunch and dinner.  Point is, I really can't get enough. \n\nAnyway, Max Brenner had me at \"Do you want a chocolate shot?\" (mind you, the woman was holding a large plastic syringe filled will delicious, warm chocolate). To Pedro P.'s dismay and slight disgust, I enthusiastically agreed to have a communal plastic syringe stuck in my mouth to try some of Max Brenner's chocolate. YUM. (I also tried a chocolate covered praline and Italian hot chocolate). And when we went to the Forum Shops in Caesar's Palace the next day, I opted for another chocolate shot before we went in for lunch. \n\nSure, the food we ordered was good. I had a mozzarella and basil pizza, but the star of the show was my adult beverage. I had a \"chocolate aphrodisiac\" called Satisfaction Guaranteed -- and yes, I was quite satisfied. \n\nThe drink has peanut and caramel liqueur and.... wait for it, wait for it.... milk chocolateeeeeee. It really was delicious. I just wish that it came in a jumbo size.
