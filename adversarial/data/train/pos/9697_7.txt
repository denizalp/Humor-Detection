My family and I were left wanting to vomit by the end of the meal. Not because it was disgusting, but because it was so delicious we couldn't waste a single bite of it!!\n\nWe ordered the non veg dosa combo. It.was.amazing.\nThere was just so many little bowls to try and every single dish had its own distinct and delightful flavor. \n\n3 hours later and none of us have that heavy feeling or gassy burps. Because indian food tends to do that.\n\nMy sister described it like this: my tummy is so happy right now, I just don't want to ever poop it out because it's so yummy and I want to stay like this forever.\n\nTMI? .....at least I'm honest.
