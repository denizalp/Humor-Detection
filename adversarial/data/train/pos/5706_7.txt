Stopped in for dinner with 2 girl friends- we arrived just before happy hour ended.\n\nUnfortunately the margarita is not fresh lime and served in a pint glass which is just so much gross fake neon mix.\n\nFor food I tried the lemon & Pomegranite grill plate with vegetables only.  This was served with \"grilled\" squash and onions with rice, pistachios and fresh Pomegranite seeds. Thank goodness for the slice of lemon & yummy Pom because otherwise this dish was a bore. \n\nThe tiramisu looked yummy but the other ladies were not a fan of it and so we did not try it. How can you not like tiramisu?  All I know is I did not want the whole thing to myself!\n\nOur server was very timely, courteous and helpful.  He served all our food correctly and made a special inquiry to the kitchen as to if the goat cheese is pasteurized.\n\nMaybe I tried the wrong dish and drink?  I say don't serve it if it's not fresh!  Next time I'm drinking wine and getting tiramisu for dessert!
