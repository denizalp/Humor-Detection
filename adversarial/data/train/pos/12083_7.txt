I don't know if I hit Ocean on an off night or what but I won't be back after my one experience here.\n\nI'm not a fan of this style of restaurant to begin with and I found the food to vary from average to poor.\n\nI've never had what I would consider good food at a Chinese buffet and have not eaten at one for years.  It will likely be years before I try one again.
