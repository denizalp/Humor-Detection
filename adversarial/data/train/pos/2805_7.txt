Maybe Foursquare was right, and checking in at bowling alleys is just one step away from \"crashing some eight-year-old's birthday party\". I sure feel that way here, at quite possibly the most kid-friendly AMF ever. Little rascals were scurrying about everywhere, even though it was roughly 9 at night. \n\nI tiptoed my way to the bar (tucked in to a far off corner) for a bit for a reprieve. Not much selection, but $1 whiskey sours at the time. Those can get you in trouble. Despite being a large building, the restroom was single-service, with quite the line. Inconvenient. \n\nThe lanes themselves were as good as they needed to be, although you can tell by the dullness of the floors this is one of the older establishments. Overall, I don't mind this place, it just seems less fun for adults than other AMFs I've been to. I'll make my way toward Bell road instead now.
