If this review was strictly based on the poker offerings in Downtown Las Vegas, this would be a 5\/5 easily. Considering the only viable competition is the dead Binion's room, the Golden Nugget poker room truly dominates the downtown poker scene, offering 1\/2 NL with no cap as well as 2\/4 LHE around the clock. \n\nBeing someone that has been intimately involved in the poker industry in Vegas as a player for over ten years now, I have seen the GN poker room change significantly over the years. Back when it first reopened in 2004 to when it relocated to its current location a few years ago. The room\nis aesthetically very beautiful with dark brown and tan tonals and velvet chairs. 13 total tables with daily tournament and cash game offerings. Most tables have automatic shufflers but lack the Genesis Bravo player tracker system that most poker rooms use in Vegas. This means that you can't view the poker room list on the Bravo app and have to call to get on the list like the old days. Also, there is no player card comp tracking. These are major criticisms as the ability to view the list via mobile is a wonderful convenience. \n\nAnother major criticism are the chairs. Though aesthetically pleasing, the wooden legged velvet chairs are not only uncomfortable but not adjustable or easily moved. They should really look at updating their chairs with office adjustable style chairs like most rooms use nowadays. \n\nThe action is good and the fact that the NL game is one of the only ones in town that has no max buy in adds a significant amount of action to that game. The 2\/4 game is a fun game with tourists and locals recreationally hanging out. \n\nAll in all, the GN poker room easily rivals the Strip casinos and is clearly the busiest room Downtown.
