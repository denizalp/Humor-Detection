First of all I don't really like trees. OK? They scare me, tall and whimsical, you never know which way the wind will blow. I have a huge really scary MONSTER tree in the yard of a rental I own on the near west side of Cleveland. I tried not to look at it, with its low hanging branches and high up dead branch. I feared the cost of pruning equally with the cost of it conking someone on the head. But it was past the time to take action so based on the reviews I called Monster. Valerie called me back within the hour, came out the next day to meet with me. She is friendly, fun and so so knowledgeable full of very useful information about trees, plants and where to get really good home grown peaches. For an amazingly reasonable price, Valerie sent the Monster crew out the next day with their bucket truck and 4 workers. They finished the job in 45 minutes. This is THE BEST TREE SERVICE EVER. I like the big tree now. It seems friendly. inviting even. It will provide a shady respite from the blazing summer sun. Maybe I'll plant one in my back yard. And if there are problems, I'll just call Valerie.
