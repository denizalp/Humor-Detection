The only reason I give this QUACK one star is so I can write a review to expound on his lack of medical knowledge and social skills. \n\nMy son went to this idiot this morning for a shoulder problem he's had since age 7. Despite having already been through physical therapy TWICE with Dr. Thomas and never getting any pain relief, they want him to do 6 MORE WEEKS OF PHYSICAL THERAPY SO THEY CAN CHARGE THOUSANDS MORE TO MY INSURANCE! They only took x-rays and didn't bother to do an MRI. \n\nI called to talk to the doctor who was by far, the most unprofessional, arrogant and rude \"Doctor\" I've ever had the displeasure of trying to converse with in an intelligent manner. \n\nThis doctor should NOT be practicing medicine.
