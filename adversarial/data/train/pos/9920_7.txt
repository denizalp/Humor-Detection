I got my coat!\n\nOn the two week mark, when I hadn't heard back from the store about my pending order, I called them and found out my coat was there since last week. It seems the girl who took down the order managed to mess up my name and phone number. \n\nI went in that same day and tried on the jacket. It seems as though I was still a little too bootyliscious for the last button not to pull across my hips. The cashier told me that they could move the button over just slightly to accommodate me (and my junk!)\n\nTen minutes late it was done and I was told that I could select a scarf from their rack as an apology for messing up my number.
