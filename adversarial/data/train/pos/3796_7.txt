Was the Fiesta Inn for a company party, some coworkers stayed , so I got to check out a few rooms, the rooms them self are nice, the 3 that I did see were all styled a little differently, one of the bathrooms you can tell there was water damage in the shower area, but that was about it. I don't think I would personally stay at the fiesta, but the company party was great! The event was catered by the Fiesta Inn and the food was delish!! Had a great time!
