One of my favorite places in the whole wide world is New York.  If I ever win the lottery that's where m moving too....  Maybe I should start playing???  I digress.  One of the best parts of Las Vegas (besides the booze) are the themed hotels.  I love the theme hotels, the really goods ones transport you somewhere else.  Yes, the \"luxury\" hotels are nice, but i much prefer to be in Faux-Paris, Faux-Venice or Faux-New York any day.\n\n::::::::::HOSPITALITY::::::::::\n\nAs is expected in Vegas, service is great.  We had an issue with the TV in our room and they were quick to replace it.  And quick to replace the replacement that died too lol.  The service technician was really funny so it wasn't all bad.\n\n::::::::::ROOMS::::::::::\n\nWe had a basic room and it was decent.  They have upgraded rooms available as well.\n\n::::::::::EXTRAS::::::::::\n\nThe roller coaster and arcade is great if you have family in tow.  Also, strolling along the mock city is pretty cool.  Once, a date and myself came in for a drink.  We had one drink (I think) and we were feeling pretty nice.  We went down to the machines and won a couple hundred dollars....SCORE.  I met a nice man here a few years ago... well I'm not sure if he was nice, but he kept buying drinks... and in my book that makes you nice.\n\nThis hotel is good for being on the strip on a budget and with family.
