Pretty good. I am not completely a meat and potatoes type of girl thus I am more drawn to sharwarma with pickles and greens but I have to say the meat was good. I also ordered hummus which was also good. A little on the chunkier side which is not everyone's favorite. Note they have a lunch buffet which is great way to try a variety of traditional Arabic dishes especially if you are a newbie to Arabic cuisine.
