If you plan to come here for servicing your car, be aware that you have to wait for an hour at minimum. They have different people entering customer appointments into the schedule, and they do not allocate enough time between appointments for certain type of services. They should have told customers not to come or an estimated wait time, so customers can make their judgement whether they should still go in that day.\n\nAlso their waiting area is really small and not welcoming. It was very uncomfortable to sit there because the put the chairs in a circle around the room, and you are basically staring at each other if you are not reading a book or playing with you iphone. It is a very small room as well, so everyone can hear you talk.
