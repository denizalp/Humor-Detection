I love yu-yu....because kushiage!!! Yummy!!  Can't believe they have a Brie cheese kushiage!!! Like what?! lol! Anyway they make everything well. My dad was super happy because ever since sushi on rainbow closed he was wondering when and where would he get  katsudon! And then we found yu-yu had it and oyakudon. Anywho, it took me forever to get my dad to come here and I was so happy when I finally did!! But he didn't even have kushiage!!! :( next time I'll get him too! \n\nThe food: he said that the katsudon was even better than sushi on rainbow! So he was happy! I personally am in love with the kushiage. It is definitely something that you should try some day! \n\nThe place: it looks like the inside of a cute little Japanese shop. Like something you would see outta an anime! I love the feeling and even though it's small it's quite spacious! \n\nOverall I really enjoy this place and have yet to be disappointed.
