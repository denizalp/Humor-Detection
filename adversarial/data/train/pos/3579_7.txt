This dental office is awesome!  Everyone is extremely friendly and helpful.  My hygienist and doctor (Joseph Musselman) were very personable folks.  They made me feel at ease, especially with all the work I had to get done.  Joseph did a fantastic job on fixing my teeth!\n\nAnd one of the best parts is that you get to watch a movie while they work on you instead of staring up at posters of kittens on the ceiling :).  Win!
