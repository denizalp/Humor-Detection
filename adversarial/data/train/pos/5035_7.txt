Checked another one off the bookmark. Yay! I was in the mood for some Croissants thought about Rosallie and figure now a good time. Not just Croissants the assorts of Croissants least over four different ones. Too many for me try one time. I order the chocolate, almond, nuttella, and regular one with the special of the day sandwich \"Croque Bosali\". I did get piece of the almond one before hooked my boys at bike store with the assortment. It was good. Croissants the whole key for me. BUTTERY and FLAKY. If you fingers get butter moist each time grab it. Beautiful thing in life. The Croissants one of the things place is known for can understand the appeal. Winnah.\n\nThe sandwich was solid. The ham and cheese (forget the cheese but not your plain cheese put it that way) was prefect combination. The Croissant for the bread is divine. The little side salad ok nothing special just basic organic mix greens with some kind house balsamic vinaigrette and couple slices of fresh oranges on the side. Eye appeal this dish is far from. Really at the end of the day about the food presentation could careless. \n\nI really like the whole interior look definitely going for some of that Paris vibe from the artwork on the walls, the way they display all the Croissants in wicker baskets, signs each different pasty even the menu in chalkboard style, and the smell is great from the minute walk in. The prices reasonable I think for the pastries. Not that I go often to bakeries in general. Definitely great spot get some coffee, great book, and great fresh pastries. They also have little outside patio area that can chill at with friends. Service was awesome. It was my first time the lady was  helpful and gave great recommendations.\n\nSince close by no doubt plan on coming back trying more of the fresh baked goodies.
