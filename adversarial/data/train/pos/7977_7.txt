Why do people go so crazy about this spot? Service is absolute crap here and the food isn't as good as the menu makes it sound. Wowowow just because you've been around Toronto for so damn long doesn't mean you're such a cool spot. \n\nLet me tell you- this place is just a spot full of old buddies catching up before the game, during the game or after work. It's such a 'bro' spot, and I say that in the most 'roll-my-eyes' kind of way. \n\nOur server seemed genuinely annoyed that we were there and getting anything seemed to take forever. It took me literally 20 minutes to ask another glass of water from this other server, who actually rolled her eyes when I asked and walked away without a response. Well sorry I didn't want to bother you either, but literally our server only served tables of dudes AROUND us and ignoring us. Even when I was trying to get my bill, it didn't come before I had to leave. I had to give my $ to my friend so he could pay for me because I had to catch my damn train. How the hell does it take you over 15 min to bring me my bill?? \n\nThe food is not anything special, literally food I can get anywhere else. Just because the menu is 'quirky' and has 'bitchin' written all over it, does not make it delicious OR food that people go there especially for. \n\nI'm not trying to be dramatic but you could not drag my dead corpse into this place again.
