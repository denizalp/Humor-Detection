So we came here on grand opening day at around 6:30 pm. We parked on Monroe with metered parking. We went in line and someone greeted us and gave us a menu, which I thought was cool. It was crowded and we ended up waiting for an hour to order our food. It was expected because it was grand opening day. Anyway, they did this thing (for grand opening day) where if you bring a package of top ramen, you get selected ramen for 50% off. When we got to the cash register, the person took our order and she had to calculate everything in her head and tell us the price, which I thought was weird. And we didn't even get an itemized receipt. We had the option of a texted or e-mailed receipt but even then, it just told us the price we paid, nothing itemized. We ordered the Shio Tonkotsu and Shoyu ramen and the Chahan (japanese-style fried rice) and oolang tea (in a can). Everything came to be $14, which wasn't bad because the ramen was 50% off. We waited 20-30 minutes for the food (expected because it was grand opening day) but when we got it, the ramen was so bland....and the noodles tasted...squishy\/soggy?? The actual broth was really bland. The only thing I thought was good was the japanese-style fried rice. That fried rice was really good! But if it's a ramen place, shouldn't the ramen be better than the fried rice.....? Anyway, I don't think I would come back here. Maybe for the fried rice....but probably not.\n\n\nBY THE WAY, the bathrooms, if you go under where it says the bathroom sign, you will see a door in front of you that says \"exit\" on top and a door to your left. Go to the door in front of you even though it says \"exit\" (it will lead you to the bathroom). I made the mistake of opening the door to my left, which was the kitchen. I asked for the bathroom and they said straight down the hall....oops. But why don't they have signs to LEAD me to the bathroom??? Come on now...
