This is my favorit place to eat for under 20 bucks on the strip. \n\nBefore I lived in Vegas I came here for vaca and stayed at the Trump. I ended up eating here like 5 times over the course of 6 or 7 days. If I am not going to ball it up at a michelin star place, its pretty tough to beat strip burger. \n\nIt has a great location- right outside Fashion Show on the corner with the Wynn- good for people watching and sitting outside. \n\nA few notes on the food\n\nSweet potato fries- amazing. They come dusted with a large grain sugar which is good in and of itself, but they also come with FRY SAUCE. For those of you who don't know, fry sauce is a mixture of BBQ sauce and manaise (or aoli) and is delicious. The fry sauce at SB is 10\/10 and on the sweet potato fries is incredible. Other than the SP fries at Burgr (that come with a can of vanilla powdered sugar) there is nothing even close in Vegas that can compete with SB.\n\nThe Shakes- are VERY thick like a shake could be. Very good. But here is the little detail that pushes them over the edge into super amazing- I always get oreo shakes and at SB they give you a straw that is about 3x as wide as a regular straw so it never clogs with cookie pieces\/you can just suck them right up. I have since seen this other places but when I first went to SB 8 years ago I was super impressed with this obviously simple innovation.\n\n\nGuac- is very good. I assume it comes from El Segundo Sol (the mexican restaurant right next to SB that is owned by the same group but SUUUUUUCKS) and it is very good. \n\nChicken wings- these are often on special as an appetizer and are very good for a non dedicated wing place. \n\nThe Burgers\n\nI generally get the southwest burger as my go to- it is awesome. The meat is always cooked right- never over cooked.  Other burgers I have enjoyed are the occasional \"little kid\" burger they have on special- it comes with like velveeta cheese on top etc. as you used to eat as a kid. The blue cheese burger is also pretty good. The Tuna burger has been a favorite of people I have been there with if you aren't into beef.
