I seriously will not eat fish, (walleye) anywhere except at this restaurant. The breading is a fine breading, not the greasy beer battered fish you get at other restaurants.\n The portions are very good quality for the price. I elected to go with a cup of Italian wedding soup, ($1.00 more) instead of the salad, along with the coleslaw and really great French fries, bread and\/or their famous Garlic Ball bread, really sticks to your ribs.\n No one in my family likes the same thing, that is why it's such a treat that they all find their own favorite and we can sit down and enjoy our meal!\nI cherish the concept of an honest to goodness restaurant, not a \"Chain restaurant\".
