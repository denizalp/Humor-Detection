Ruel our server was funny & definitely would brighten anyone's morning!  Excellent service & specials, like at the other Stations Casinos Grand Cafe's!  For only $16.19, I fed myself & both of my parents, plus used my Stations Casinos Card & it was basically free.  \n\nAlso I love that every October they make these special Breast Cancer awareness pastry's at each of the Grand Cafe's.
