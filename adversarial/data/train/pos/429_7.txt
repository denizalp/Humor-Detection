BINGO!!!\n\nBingo Package (Validated) = $27\nElectronic Game Upgrade = $2\nElectronic Game Surcharge = $2\nDouble Double \/ Dual Action (chance at the $10,000+ Coverall) = $2\nDiscount w\/your Player Card = $5\nYelling \"BINGO\" as loud as possible after a win = Priceless\n\nSouth Point's Bingo was ranked \"Best Bingo in Las Vegas\" from 2011 to 2014.  And you know what?....I totally agree.  I agree because the room is spacious, clean, the price is right, and there's always a chance that I'm yelling BINGO.  Last year on my birthday, I witnessed one person win over $10,000 and 3 people win at least $1,000.  By the way, I was one of those winners.  My girlfriend won on my birthday last year and again this year.  I'm not giving South Point's Bingo Room 5 Stars because I won.  I'm giving them 5 Stars because I'm comfortable playing here and a lot of people win here.  Everyone has their lucky place to play Bingo.  I found my lucky place here at The South Point Casino.  \n\nTIP #1:  $5 Discount w\/your Player's Card.  \nTIP #2:  Get here at least 15 minutes before start time.  The line can get a little long.\nTIP #3:  Two free drinks.  Don't worry, they don't count or track it. \nTIP #4:  The Electronic Game is a lot easier than the paper. \nTIP #5:  This is not non-smoking Bingo room.\n\n2016 Yelp Review #17
