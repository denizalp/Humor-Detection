OMG... Ok let me start with -I'm Mexican- and I know I don't look Mexican but I am.\nSomeone from work recommend me this restaurant, I was surprised when she told me the location because I live reaaally close and I've never heard of chachos before and I LOVE my mexican food, so the other day my hubby and I payed a visit to check it out.\n\nLet me start with the area, it's hidden and probably if you are not looking you are not going to find it but once you are inside the place will transport you to mexico, it's not the typical \"fondita\" looking style, it's causal but elegant at the same time, it's like being in a mexican house.  \n\nWe saw the menu and we were surprised by all the options\nWe started with an order of fish tacos and tacos al pastor, we were expecting those small \"taquera\" tortilla (because that's what you usually get with fish and pastor tacos) we were wrong, the portions are pretty generous, the tacos come with a double tortilla (just like in Mexico  ) so they are filling (a lot) and delicious, I mean DELICIOUS.\n\nWe didn't know that the sizes were going to be that big so previously we ordered enchiladas, I ordered the mole rojo (amazing) and he ordered the mole verde (great as well) everything was amazing, \nthe food was incredible we both felt as if we were in Mexico not only the food was great but the drinks too and when we thought nothing could be better I ordered the \nflan  (I know .... I was full but I couldn't resist) BEST FLAN IN TORONTO. \n\nHonestly it was perfect, everything, the service, the place, the food, the drinks !!\n\nIt makes me sad that places like this, with amazing food are not getting as much attention as they should.\n\nITS A MUST
