Woe to the unknowing tourists who step foot in the Caesar's Shoppes LV store: the sales assistants are hella snobby here. I've been to LV San Francisco, Bal Harbor, New York, and found Las Vegas's sales assistants to be quite rude to the point of astonishment. Mind you, I wasn't dressed like a scrub, I figure looking like a Japanese tourist would have given me some points -- nope!\n\nAfter waiting expectantly near the display counters, I had to flag this disinterested Asian sales assistant to hunt down a damier Speedy 30 bag. \nAfter he plunks it down for me to inspect, he asked: \"So...how many Louis Vuittons do you own?\"\n Uh....does that matter? I decided to be honest and tell the truth: \"Just one but I plan to grow my collection. I have the  pochette and, on the side, I have a Marc Jacobs venetia bag I love.\"\nHe stares down at me: \"Marc Jacobs DOESN\"T COUNT.\"\nRealllly? Despite the fact he's LV's creative director? Wow. Talk about dissing your own company's top designer. Congratulations.\nSays I: \"Well, he is their creative designer and alot of his designs criss cross.\"  \nUrgh. I had my personal Julia Roberts \/ Pretty Woman moment in Caesars of all places. The SA was clearly uneducated about Louis Vuitton's catalogue -- I had to correct him after another tourist asked him about the summer pattern of  another Speedy bag I had looked at earlier-- yeah, that's right its DAMIER AZUR mister.  After my personal experience, it wouldn't matter if I had won a million dollars in black jack, I wouldn't spend any of it at Louis Vuitton Vegas. As Julia Roberts said, \"Big mistake!\"
