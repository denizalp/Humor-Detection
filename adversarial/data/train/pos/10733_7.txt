Great seafood in Phoenix is far and few between. Buck and Rider has great seafood and sushi but I have yet to have anything else on the menu that tickles my fancy. So far I've tried the crunchy shrimp roll, pink moon oysters, and lobster which were all 5 stars but I've been disappointed by every non seafood item I've tried here. Fried rice was salty, avocado toast was basic, and the Brussels sprouts didn't impress me either. So far it's a love hate relationship because I really love seafood but I hate the non seafood items on the menu and they don't serve lobster rolls which is mind boggling.
