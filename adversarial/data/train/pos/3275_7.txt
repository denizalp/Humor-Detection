I'm in love with my vacuum again! I took my Dyson in to be cleaned and serviced after contemplating replacing it. For less than $140 the vacuum is just like new. My floors and wallet thank you! (Just saved me $500 for new vacuum purchase). Service is great; staff is very friendly and helpful. They even gave me a high-end loaner while mine was being serviced.
