WOW!\n\nI was completely blown away by this place.  My friend from Vegas lives and dies by this place, and I now know why!\n\nUpon our arrival into Las Vegas, my friend immediately decided that this is where we would be eating for dinner.  After a quick shower and some down time, we finally met back up with my friend and hailed a cab to Firefly.\n\nMiami needs a Firefly!  What a great ambiance.  When we first arrived, they were a bit crowded and we sat at the bar to have a couple of drinks and await our table.  Not too long after, we were seated in a seperate area that was originally the restuarant next door.  Great atmosphere and loved the decoration.  Low lighting, lots of use of the color red.  Totally my vibe!  :)\n\nI was advised that EVERYTHING on the menu is absolutely delicious, and that I MUST try the croquetas and empanadas.  Alrighty then, I said.  Here we go!  Oh, and the Sangria is a must-try too!\n\nBetween 3 of us we had:\n\n*the Ham & Cheese Croquetas - OMG, delish!  Soooo tasty with the addition of the cheese!  A new fave.\n\n*the Empanadas (with Pork) - very tasty and cooked to perfection, with the crispiest, flakiest dough that melts in your mouth.\n\n*the Crispy Duck rolls - these were good, but not my fave.  A little gamey for my taste, and I usually really like duck, but the crispyness was good and I enjoyed the cherry sauce drizzled over...\n\n*Petite Filet - hands down my FAVE dish of the night.  The filet was cooked to perfection, and the mushrooms were just melt-in-your-mouth good!  The roasted potatoes that were also mixed in, along with the red wine sauce, were just PERFECTION.  :)\n\n*Manchego Mac&Cheese - what an awesome twist on a traditional dish!  I must learn to make this at home.\n\n*Tuna Tartare - WOW!  I've never had such delicious tuna.  It was not served as traditional thin slices, but in small diced pieces with a delicious sauce (not sure what the sauce was) drizzled over it, served on a bed of edamame and enoki salad with taro chips.  I would use the chip to pile on everything else on top of it and then eat this crunch concoction!  SOOOO GOOD!\n\nFor dessert we all shared the Banana-Nutella sandwiches, which were ORGASMICLY divine!  My new favorite dessert!  SOOOO tasty.\n\nI give this place 5+++++ Stars!  I wish I would have had the chance to return while on my trip, but alas it was too short.  I will DEFINITELY be back here the next time I am in Vegas to try the rest of the items on the menu!
