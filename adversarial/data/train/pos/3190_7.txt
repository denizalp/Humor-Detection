Sadly after much anticipation, this place unfortunately is a cliche of every brewpub that opens on a weekly basis. We need something creative people!! Same tired old brewer standing there with his what has now become brewers uni gray work shirt with the brewery name on his back, and a ball cap on. Nothing unique here really. The IPA was somewhat disappointing, a little gassy, and not very comprehensive. The menu was pretty typical. I didn't eat, but I did see some burgers coming out with soggy lettuce and of course the prerequisite fries in a cone. This isn't what breweries were meant to be. They were for honest hard working people, looking for escape, and some decent grub, not some high falutin quasi bistro, with a souvenir stand.
