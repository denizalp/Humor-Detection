Oh dear.....looks like I love artery clogging burgers! This one was definitely the best I'd ever had... How could it not be with grilled cheese, butter, beef patties (cooked to perfection) and god knows what else was in there. I was here for the last 2014 Burger Brigade w\/ some awesome Yelpers. This time, instead of ordering a crappy cheeseburger, I got the Vatican. Holy craps!! It was absolutely delish! \n\nMy hubby ordered the High Priest burger and it honestly reminded me of McD's Big Mac. He was also disappointed and ordered the Vatican after. Crazyyyyy! At least now we know to def. order the Vatican here ! \n\nWish they would list the secret menu on site though instead of just online... and the prices! Yes I know... it's supposed to be a secret...\n\nHigh Priest Burger is $ 9.79\nHoly Smokes $ 9.68\nVatican City $ 11.59\n\nWill definitely be back again....maybe next month for my bday so I can grab the Cheesecake Factory Godiva Cheesecake close by ......... :D \n\nLots of parking.
