It's fun here as we get to bring our Dog shopping in the store with us or drop him off to get groomed! Their prices aren't that much more than Walmart, but it's worth it! This store is MUCH CLEANER than Walmart & has a HUGE selection of anything Animal including animals for adoption or you can buy fish as well.\n\nMy kids love it and our dog loves it as well...
