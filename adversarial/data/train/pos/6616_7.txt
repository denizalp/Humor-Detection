When I first moved to Phoenix and then to the East Valley I was looking for new and different places to try.  I had never heard of Culver's.  I looked over their website and on one Saturday afternoon my daughter and I took a ride out this way.  We looked over the menu and I had one of their famous Butter Burgers.....Mushroom and Swiss, and my daughter had a grilled cheese.  The kids meals come with a one scoop sundae too, good deal.  Let me say that Butter Burgers are delicious!  I love them.  Their fries are good too but then I found cheese curds......OMG!  I am from California so I had never had these morsals of goodness before.  A Butter Burger, cheese curds and a root beer and I'm good.  But then the frozen custard.......YUM!!!  And a Concrete Mixer....wow!  And they run a special on pints to take home.  You can get 4 pints of custard for $8 and change!  Good deal!  They have a different flavor everyday.  Recently I had Pumpkin Pecan and it was delicious! The service is always fast and friendly.  I have never experienced anything but a smile here.  This location is about 10 miles from me and not far in the grand scheme of things.  I recently found out that they opened a new location closer to me!!  YAY!!  Forget those other fast food joints.  McDonald's pales in comparison.  Butter Burgers are fresh and soooo good.  And they have a variety of other choices.  They also offer fried chicken, fish and salads.  But note....this is NOT for someone on a diet.  This is where you splurge!  I love Culvers!!  Now if In and Out had frozen custard too I would be torn.
