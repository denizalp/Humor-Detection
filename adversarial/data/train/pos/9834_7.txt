What person in their right mind doesn't want to feel like a kid again? Personally, I seize every opportunity I can to feel a rush of excitement that kids experience so easily. That includes candy stores.\n\nHaving initially had its home at the Calgary Farmers' Market, The Candy Kid now occupies the first half of this space in Kensington after the market closed at the Currie Barracks last December. Kensington touts itself as an \"urban village.\" All it was missing to complete the look was a candy store.\n\nThe selection of treats at The Candy Kid in no way compares to the variety of items you'd find at Welch's out in Banff, but it does have gummies sold by the cup full, barrels filled with salt water taffy, pieces of Turkish delight, fudge, and a myriad of other goodies that are sure to have your dentist running for the hills.\n\nI came home with three bars of fudge and a bag full of lego shaped candy. Out of the Strawberry Cheesecake, Coffee Mocha and Pralines'n'Cream fudge flavours I bought, I think I like the Pralines'n'Cream the best (it's also my favourite kind of ice cream-my one grandma quality).\n\nNext time I'm going for a bag full of salt water taffy. I love that stuff!\n\nIf you haven't checked them out yet, why not pop in for a quick boo? There's nothing like feeling like a kid in a candy store.
