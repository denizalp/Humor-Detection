Two years later, I received correspondence from a second attorney with Jon's attempt to silence my constitutional right to free speech in stating exactly what transpired when he visited my business. I have been contacted with a threat of a lawsuit now by two attorneys, two civil lawsuits have been filed and then dropped against me but not once has there been any sort of apology for cussing at my employees or disrupting my business.
