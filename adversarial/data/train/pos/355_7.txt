My Japanese wife and I decided to give this place a try. She is very hard to please when it comes to her native food and this was one of the few in Vegas that stood up to the test. The service was premiere on par with places at 3 to 4 times the cost. The food was the best and the price was more then fair if not lower then I would expect for what we ordered. I have no issues giving them a 5 star review!
