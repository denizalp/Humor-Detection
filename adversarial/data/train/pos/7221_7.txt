So glad we found this little gem that just opened in the heart of Scottsdale. We brought our dog here for the first time over the weekend and in doing so have found a new go-to place for not only grooming but for pet food, goodies and toys!\n\nUpon entering Wag N' Wash we were greeted with smiles, hellos and and a first timer tour of the building. Our primary reason for going was to utilize their self-wash setup. We chose the ultimate wash which includes an upgraded soaping machine, leave-in conditioner, cologne, brushes, towels, drying, etc...Our pup isn't the easiest dog to bathe but it was certainly an easier experience here than struggling with him in the bathtub at home! While we only have used this option, it seems a good idea to spend the extra $4 and upgrade to ultimate wash!\n\nAfter Dexter was clean as a whistle (and smelled good to boot) we roamed around the store. They offer a variety of toys and collars that you would not normally find in a Petsmart type store. They also have an in-house kitchen\/bakery that offers homemade treats and goodies for our four-legged friends. We're looking forward to ordering a birthday cake for our little man this fall!\n\nOther than the self-wash, another main draw of this store is their selection of food. They offer a huge selection of lesser known but wholesome and nutritious foods you find rarely at the large pet stores. Steve, one of the owners, took the time to talk to us about our pup's health and nutrition. He offered us organic and natural solutions to what otherwise has been a situation where our dog has be on prescription foods and supplements. As a pet-parent that encourages a grain-free diet and doesn't want to pump my kids full of unnecessary remedies, I really appreciated Steve's knowledge and advice in the matter. \n\nYay, Wag N' Wash! We can't wait to come back and visit. We'll work on his jumping habits before Dexter comes back :)
