The coffee here is great, and the atmosphere is the closest thing I've found to a Sydney cafe on my side of the MTL.\n\nThey don't server much more than (good) pastries and sandwiches to eat, but what more do you want with your (great) coffee? If you answered \"nothing\" then you are correct. If you answered something else, get out of my review already.\n\nAre you around Marche Atwater? Looking for good coffee? Stop reading this review, and go there now. Seriously. This review will still be here, and it'll be better if you read it with a coffee.\n\nFor the nerds (like me): Has good wifi.
