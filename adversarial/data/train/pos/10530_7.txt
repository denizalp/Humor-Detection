I used this company a couple months ago. This company is a scam and a disappointment. When I made the appointment, I was quoted a certain price for everything I was having done. When the guy came to change my locks he claimed that was only if I gave them a perfect review on Google. Then, he offered to change an additional lock for me, with no mention of any additional fees. When he handed me the receipt it was $100 higher than it should've been. Luckily I had 4 people with me to witness the dishonesty. The technical also backed his truck into my neighbor's driveway wall which I couldn't believe! He was more concerned about his truck than the damage he did. Unfortunately for this company, they hired someone who is not a good representation and I will never trust them for my business again.
