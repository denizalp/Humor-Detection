All my favorite Chinese restaurants never last. I hope this one will last. \n\nI haven't tried too many of their dishes. But the self-serve hot pot by the pound is so worth it. You only pick what you want to eat and they charge you by the pounds. The meat is $9.99\/pound and the non-meat is $4.99\/pound. After I put so many things I like in my two bowls, it came to less than $15 for both meat and vegetable. And I love the fact that they don't count the bowl to the weight, which means you pay exactly what you get. \n\nThe first time I went there I picked the medium spicy broth, and it was perfect for me. I eat spicy for life, so for those that don't eat spicy food regularly, you might need to choose the lesser spicy option. The flavor of the broth reminds me to the spicy broth at Little Sheep Mongolian Hot Pot. \n\nThe second time I went, I chose the same medium spicy. But it came out a little too spicy for me. So I ordered another set of vegetables with no spicy broth to mixed them with the spicy one to balanced the spicy level. I thought the non-spicy one was going to be plain and no flavor. To my surprise, the non-spicy broth was actually pretty tasty. I didn't even need to mix it together. I kind of like having both options.\n\nMy advise to you all first-timers. Get one bowl of the meat with the spicy broth and get another bowl with non-spicy broth for the vegetables. Those two with a bowl of rice will be enough to feed 2-4 people. \n\nYou will notice that the broth is very oily and has a lot of herbs that might not be pleasant when you accidentally eat it. But that's normal. That's just how the traditional food is made. The oil is important to keep the broth hot without stove. The legend says that long time ago, there was a lady from Yunnan that had to bring food to her husband that worked far away from home. But every time she arrived to her husband work place, the food has became cold due to the cold weather in Yunnan. That's how she figured a way to keep the broth hot without reheating it which is by adding a lot of oil to the broth. \n\nSo if you don't like something too oily and spicy. Then this place might not be the right place for you. Which is okay, that means more room for me to sit. :)\n\nI have a feeling I am going to go this place every week. Especially during winter time. \n\n\nSpicy food. Checked.\nFlavor. Checked. \nPrice. Checked.\nAmbiance. Checked.\nLocation. Checked. \nParking. Checked. \nUniqueness. Checked. \nCustomer service.
