I lived here for five months and hated every single day. The walls are thin the neighbors are loud and the maintence does not respond when needed. The front office staff is always changing ( there were two different managers since I moved in) and they aren't helpful at all. I would never live here or recommend this place to anyone unless I hated you and wanted you to suffer. Save yourselves from a crappy apartment and a waste of money and go somewhere else.
