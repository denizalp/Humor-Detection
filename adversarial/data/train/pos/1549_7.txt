They have a pharmacist named Sampson (half baked  anyone?) I cant resist saying \"I want to talk to Sampson\" in my best Dave Chappelle voice every time im in this place to pick up my medication. ........other than that, just your normal CVS, nothing too spetacular but they get the job done. They even send a text message when my perscription is ready to be picked up.
