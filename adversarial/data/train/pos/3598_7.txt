It may be the largest tennis facility in town, and one of the largest in the country, but I just can't really recommend it. I like that there is a large stadium court in the center, and an on-site shop, and the courts themselves are well-maintained, but that's about where the fun ends.\n\nCourts are spread out without much signage- had some difficulty meeting up with friends here because we couldn't find them. The front gate entrance area does not have competent staff. Gate is locked, you have to enter through the shop, no one there can tell me where others are playing, no one can tell me who to speak to about lessons, and calls go unreturned. \n\nAnd that's without even getting into a discussion about their members. Let's just say money can't buy class. It's sad when the commentary from the home team spectators is on par with what you'd hear in a high school gym.
