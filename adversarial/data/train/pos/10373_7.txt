We were referred to this business by coworkers of my late sister in law in August of 2014. The sale was held in September 2014 and we ended up with missing items, an extra trip for me from New Jersey to deal with details Mr. Bennett did not complete (like donating items to charity, cleaning out the house, securing a dumptster and disposing of all trash), a police report for items missing, a financial loss from the entire experience and extreme distress for family members.  \n\nIf you have visited his business website at madisonsales net, please visit madisonsales info as well.  I've also had the experience of purchasing one of our items back from ebay.\n\nI strongly suggest to anyone considering an estate sale to take photographs of EVERYTHING prior to the sale as we did. If there are valuables, please document what they are and insist on asking what price will be charged as well as an itemized list of what they actually sold for.\n\nMr. Bennet told us he was the only company in the area that provided receipts and collected sales tax.  We found it interesting several of our friends had to ask for reciepts (even on items that were over $100) were not charged sales tax yet a local reseller who provided his tax exempt number was asked to pay tax anyway.  He ended up tearing up his check and leaving with nothing. \n\nMr. Bennett was very difficult to communicate with after the contract was signed.  He would not return phone calls in a timely manner, if at all.  I have made the entire chain of emails between Mr Bennett and myself public in another venue should anyone want this info.\n\nMy attorney is currently seeking another attorney who is licensed in Wisconsin so we can pursue the matter further.  There is a police report filed in Milton.\n\nAt one point, Mr Bennett offered a partial refund if we signed an agreement not to leave negative feedback on the web (documented in emails elsewhere if you want the madisonsales INFO).
