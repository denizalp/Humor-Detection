Sometimes when I choose to go home down University Drive, I stop here. We all like it. The store is very clean, as well as a very friendly staff. A bit unusual for a fast food place. That is one of the reasons I like it so very much. I am not really a fan of the bun it comes on. So I may take a bite or two then, toss that part of it. \nBut, no denying that the Chicken is wonderful and cooked just right. As well as the lovely Cottage fries. Or Waffle fries as they call them. They even have a drive through that makes it even nicer. I have to love Chick fil A
