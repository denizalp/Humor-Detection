A real 4.5-star rating for lil' Baguette Cafe. If you're in the area (or work nearby), there's no better place to pick up a fresh 'wich, salad, or juice. The menu is small, so they don't spread themselves to thin here. That being said, theres something for everyone. Eggs all day, salads (with various greens and meats), pastries and hot & cold sandwiches are all represented. I've yet to hit the pressed sammies, but The Turkey, crispy greens and egg baguette panini (w\/ ham added) are enough to have me hooked. Everything tasted fresh and the portion sizes were perfect for lunch.\n\nThe real knocks here are the location (NOT easy to find from the road. Use the map in the Yelp app) and that the place is a bit small. When the queue reaches 4+ people, you might be waiting outside or right on someone who is eating. Avoid the lunch rush and you're money!
