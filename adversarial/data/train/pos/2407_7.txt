If you are easily offended, or don't have a sense of humor, this website is not for you.  I have bought several shirts from tshirthell over the years, and many of my friends have as well.  There are some shirts that I wouldn't have the balls to wear in public, and some that make me cringe, but I have an open mind and can see humor in most things.  Even if I can't I don't fault those that can.  Probably one of my own favorite shirts is the one that says \"Easy as Sunday Morning\" or \"Till Sunrise Do Us Part\".  Step one is to find the shirt you like.  Then you pick what style of shirt, from long sleeve, short sleeve, sweatshirt, baby-doll, tank top, etc.  Pick the color out of ton of color choices.  Then you are set.  I suggest signing up for the newsletter while you're at it.  Aside from it being hilarious (in my opinion) there are always different contests for chances to win free shirts.  Plus you'll be notified of sales and special officers.  I just want to say it again; this website is not for the easily offended.  You've been warned.
