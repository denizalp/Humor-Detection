This place is nasty and the owner and manager \"Mo\" are jerk offs!!!!! i placed order for pizza and chicken wings and both were gross but chicken wings were a lot worse so i called to make complaint. The guy on phone told me what is he supposed to do about it and then when i asked to speak to owner he hung up on me. i called back to speak to owner and when i told him his food was not good he told me f*#@ you and hung up. I would never recommend this place and they have bad business owners.
