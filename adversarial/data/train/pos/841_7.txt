This is probably the best toy store I've been - there is a large range of toys, however, it seems geared more toward adults and older children.\n\nThere are a lot of collectibles in locked cases and the best part, the huge wall of Funko Pop vinyl figures! These are adorable vinyl figures of popular television, movie, and real life characters that have been shrunk down and paired with disproportionally large heads. Prior to The Toy Box, I would purchase these vinyl figures on Amazon (if available). Although most of the prices are higher compared to Amazon, it's nice to see them in person and there are many figures that are hard to find online. They seem to range in price depending on their popularity, but they start around $10.\n\nThey have a nice Yelp check-in offer of 15% off one item, so don't forget to utilize it!
