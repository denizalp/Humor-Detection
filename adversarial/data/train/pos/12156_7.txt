Walking Dead.  That's all I have to say.  Employees are walkers and shoppers are walkers.  They do have cheap prices, I'll give them that.\n\nMy experience with any Superstore (this one is no exception).  There is little to no human interaction.  Some people like this.  I for one would rather have people stocking shelves in each section to help answer any questions, make suggestions.\n\nOverall, it's a clean place to get cheap groceries.  You just have to end up spending an hour to get one item because of how big it is.
