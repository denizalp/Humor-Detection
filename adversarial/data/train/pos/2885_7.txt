We had a really great dinner here before seeing Celine Dion... the ambiance is very pleasant and the service was outstanding! We enjoyed a carafe of red sangria, I had a grilled salmon salad (yes I was tempted by the pasta, but I decided to go light - hey I was wearing a body con skirt!), and the BF had chicken parm which is usually what he orders when we go to an Italian place. It was pounded thin, so it wasn't as heavy as others he's had. We finished the meal with chocolate mousse gelati (ok so I was just a little naughty lol). All in all, we would definitely go back here!
