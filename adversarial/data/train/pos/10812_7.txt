Apparently I'm still a kid at heart and more of an adrenalin junky than I remember. Visited the park for the 1st time in many years. Love the new entrance with the Fury 325 greeting you as you approach. Ok, let's get right to it. Fury 325....incredible, exhilarating, breathtaking and by far the best ride I've experienced here ever! I agree with some of the other reviews. This ride has a different experience depending on where you sit. Started off in the middle, then the back and on to the front. I have to say, the front seat was the best. We were here on a Thursday. One of the employee's said it's the slowest day of the week. Yes, we benefited from it. My daughter and I road Fury 8 times. I was sad that we missed the opportunity to ride Thunder Road one last time but it was old. Really enjoyed the Intimidator, Afterburn and Night Hawk(?). All the ride names have changed since my last visit. Oh well, still a blast. Has me contemplating getting a season pass for next year. Oh, one last note. The park gets pretty busy after 4pm. I guess there is discount tickets after 4.
