Stopped by with a friend this past weekend to check out this little dive bar tucked away in an old strip mall.\n\nFrom the outside it doesn't look like much but the inside is a different story. Hooligans has a 60s vibe on the inside, rows of dart boards, and plenty of brews on hand. We tried the chicken fingers and steak sliders, both of which were excellent. Service was great, the bartender was real friendly and even upgraded our yelp check-in drink to a 16oz for free. \n\nI wanna come by and check out the mass burger as everyone has been raving about it. The happy hour doesn't seem like a bad deal either. Overall a pretty good experience and worth a second trip.
