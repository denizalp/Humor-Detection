Wanted to give this place a shot as it was my local Caribbean joint, but boy was I disappointed.  There was one measly piece of jerk chicken left, which I wanted to order anyway (since I was craving it) and tried to order it with a small oxtail.  Turns out that you can't do that, so I ended up having to order two small dinners which came with two large heaps of rice & beans (that I didn't particularly care for).  \n\nThe total was about $16 and what I got for that money simply wasn't worth it.  The jerk chicken wasn't even jerked; it had been out for awhile and was quite dry.  Against my better judgment, I ate it.  The oxtail was mostly fat and very little meat. \n\nI'm not going back to this place, but I had to cross it off my list.
