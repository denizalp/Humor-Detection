I am here pretty often for lunch, probably once a week or so.  I love the owner, she is such a sweet woman and always takes up a lot of time chatting with us.  She always picks on me about how much sweet tea I drink :).  Speaking of tea, the sweet tea and jasmine tea are some of the best you can get!\n\nLunch always comes with a free cup of soup which is always different and delicious.  I do eat dinner here on occassion as I did tonight but mostly I am there for lunch.  I usually get the Pad Thai or the Red Curry.  The Red Curry is excellent and comes with a side of white rice.  It's honestly some of the best Red Curry I have ever had and beats Monsoon on South Blvd hands down.  The Pad Thai is great too and I usually order it with extra chicken and with 1 star (stars = heat index).  I also highly suggest the Thom Kha soup as it is similar to the Red Curry. \n\nThe free soup usually comes out pretty fast and the refills on drinks are pretty quick too.  Although sometimes they do get a little bogged down during lunch.  All in all this is a great place to eat if you like Red Curry and Pad Thai.  It's worth the trip to just hang out and talk to the owner!
