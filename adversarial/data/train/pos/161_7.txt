Sorry Buffalo Wild Wings but if you insist on hiring stupid people then I am going to have to stop going here. I tried to order the lunch buffalito with chips and salsa instead of a salad. I have done this on numerous occasions in the past. Never been a problem. Today however, the girl told me she couldn't do that. I asked why since I have done it in the past. She told me there wasn't a button for that. I just wonder how they could have possibly changed it in the past without a button for it??? Makes you wonder....... \n\nI'm done with them for a while. I really like the buffalito but the stupid wait staff out weigh my fondness for the buffalito. \n\nThere's not a button for that. Seriously?
