This buffet is actually really good.  Lunch was $20; which isn't bad at all for what you get.\n\nAs expected, there's a huge variety of good to great tasting food.  The range of nationalities to choose from here isn't as diverse as a lot of other Las Vegas buffets, but the selection is still impressively vast.\n\nI personally would recommend the roasted chicken (melts in your mouth), and of all things, the sliders (both the beef and the turkey)!\n\nTIP: If you gamble enough, use your MGM player's card at the register to get your meal partially\/fully comped.\n\nTIP #2: As with all buffets, if it fits into your schedule, try to time your entrance into the buffet for the very end of lunch.  This way, they'll be bringing out the (pricier) dinner items, and you will have paid the lunch price!  ;)
