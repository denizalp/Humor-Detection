Look,i don't know what the people who gave this place more than one star are smoking, but I could have used it today. Had to drop someone off. Lets give it a try i say to myself. Hmmm looks closed, lights off in the back. Wait a few minutes. Mysterious head pops up, comes out, takes my order. Must buy combo to get slice. Fine. Hmmm where do i sit. Lets try outside since every single table is dirty. Ok after 5 min a slice of cheese pizza is set before me. One taste and i couldn't tell if he gave me pizza or the box it came in. Look I love pizza. I'll even eat totinos, but two bites and i was gone. This place had to be a front for something. Maybe they have a hidden casino in the back. Maybe i didn't give the code word. Smuggling ring perhaps, cause it can't be a pizza place, that's for sure. Please close and make room for something eatable.
