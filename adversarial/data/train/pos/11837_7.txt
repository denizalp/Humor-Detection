The Apple Store is a fun place to browse around, wishing you could afford some of the cool stuff that rolls out of their factories (iPhone, anyone?). The store is very nice and slick on both the inside and out, just like their products. It is easy to find what you're looking for, as the store is small and well organized. The staff is very friendly and are willing to help you out with any of your demands. You are able to test out many of their products, including the computers and the iPhones. The Genius Bar is a great concept, where you can get help for any of your Apple products. They were able to help me fix my iPod a while back. The only downside to the Genius Bar is you have to make appointments on the Apple website. Overall, the Apple Store is a great place to spend some time wishing you had some of the cool stuff that Apple makes, or buying it for yourself. It is worth the drive from anywhere in Greater Cleveland, especially considering it's the only Apple Store in Greater Cleveland. Note: I have a PC, not a Mac, just in case you're wondering.
