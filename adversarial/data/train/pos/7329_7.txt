Calling all Italian food and entertainment lovers!!!\n\nI have been going to the annual San Gennaro feast couple times a year, when it was at 215\/flamingo. And now they have moved their location to Silverton casino! \n\nSo here are my overall thoughts...\n\n[FOOD] \nThe overall food was average and not to mention! pricey! holy cow! We had the \"infamous\" sausage and pepper sandwich $8 (meh), garlic fries $6 (yum), and of course for dessert... the funnel cake! (dark & white chocolate drizzle with cherries on top $6) mmmm! **2 stars \nTip for thought - bring cash to this event because its an easier transaction, some vendors don't accept credit\/debit cards. \n\n[RIDES] \nThe only highlight for me was Wednesday's, MOM'S RIDE FOR FREE!! whoo hoo. Saved $25. They also had Father's ride for free on Thursday! Fri-Sun is regular fees. Too bad they don't have a 'kids ride for free' day too! that would of made the rating higher haha. Just sayin. They sell unlimited wristbands for $25 - definite must for my daughter and for all kids. **2 stars\n\n[ENTERTAINMENT] \nno offense...but the music is not what I'm use to, I digg it on some levels. Its just not my cup of tea. however, the alcohol drinks helped!!! haha. \n\nI like the fact that this event is twice a year. It's nice to get away from the hectic Vegas nightlife and shenanigans. It's definitely something you'd want to check out for some fun and enjoyment.
