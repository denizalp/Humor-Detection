Simply put, if you want an extremely affordable, easy, fun, meet awesome people, and not deal with any of the usual club BS politics, then you MUST grab a spot on their bus\/club crawl!!! Sin city was incredible! Both the bar crawl and literally Las Vegas.\n\nThe bachelor party I was with, surprise, wanted to go out to clubs, but of course didn't want to spend thousands paying our way in and getting bottle service. You know how it goes...\"oh you don't have any girls with you?...oh there's 10 guys in your group?....oh and you don't want bottle service?....ok, please wait over here in line for a couple hours, thanks.\"\n\nSin City bar crawl meets up in the Planet Hollywood Hotel at PBR, where you can take advantage of their cheap drink specials and start building your buzz. From there you check-in, get your colored wrist band that shows you're with the Sin City crew, and hop on the party bus to the first venue. Now when we did it, there were actually 3 party buses to choose from, with one of them being a HUGE double decker bus. Yeah, I highly recommend you choose the double decker haha! Anyway, once on board you'll receive free glasses of this mystery mixed cocktail that your host keeps pouring you. I wouldn't say it's anything crazy strong, but you'll be mixing that with the rest of your drinking throughout the night. Plenty of space on the bus, great music, lights, atmosphere, and the host was nuts\/hilarious! \n\nSo, we stopped off first at 1 Oak. We spent about an hour or so there, and then they rounded us up again. Afterwards, we went to Tryst at the Wynn, and then Haze at Aria. Such an incredible time!\n\nTo stress again, no lines, no cover, or waiting occurred at any of the clubs we went too that night. \n\nHighly recommend and will absolutely do it again in the future. FYI, we bought our passes on Groupon for half off, so you should definitely check there first before booking.
