3.5 stars for the food\n2.5 stars for the service\n\nI've never been to the Plaza before....it's like walking into a time machine. The Paradise location does not take reservations on Friday or Saturday and since someone recommended going to this one, we decided why not? The valet was very slow so by the time we arrived, we were later than late since the 15 had an accident. However, my friends that were on time said that had to wait 20 minutes for the server to even come and take their drink order. Please note that when I arrived, the place was not very busy at all. On a plus side, We had an awesome view of the Fremont Street from our table. \n\nAfter I looked at the menu, I decided to order the tuna tartare, manchego mac and cheese, petite filet, steamed mussels, lamb chops and a pitcher of the Mango Mojito.  It took another 15-20 minutes for my mojito to come out and that was after my bf waved down someone asking for the update of our drinks. Luckily the food started arriving fairly quickly after I had some mojito in me. The tuna tartare was such a dissappointment. The taro chips were so stale that the dish was a big fat FAIL.  They did redeem themselves with their mussels. The petite filet was oh so tender and juicy that I wanted more, but I was pretty much full with some yummy mac and cheese in me.  I did get to try the smoked salmon toast that my friend had order. It was pretty good, but salty...so if you don't like salty don't go for this dish. I didn't try the lamb chops since I was really full, but the bf enjoyed it. On the plus side, since we had to ask what the status was on our drinks, we got another pitcher for free!  Overall, I thought it was ok and the view was nice, but I probably won't be returning here unless someone else has a dinner here.
