I've always heard about this place and finally get to try it today! We wanted to come in for brunch but missed it by just a bit (I think they end brunch around 12 and then switch to lunch \/ dinner menu). \n\nWe tried the broccoli tempura, caesar salad, duck fried rice and the smash burger. Smash burger was pretty tasty though more greasy than I expected and not as hot, suggesting it was sitting around for a bit. The duck fried rice was pretty good, though the rice wasn't the traditional rice found in fried rice but like the instant rice thats like slippery, bigger than regular jasmine rice, and soft. The salad tasted almost like regular Caesar salad but slightly more rich. Finally the broccoli tempura was better than the usual tempura because it had this special sauce that was a bit spicy but made it really tasty.\n\nI'd definitely come back to try it out, it's food is definitely better than you typical comfort food restaurant. The prices are pretty good as well.
