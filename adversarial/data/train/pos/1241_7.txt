Wow I can't believe I forgot to put in a review, I'm late 10 months. This truck was in east Mesa when I went and they were super nice! They ended up messing up my order but then provided me awesome customer service by replacing it! I ordered the puffle\/bubble\/Hong Kong style waffle with cookie dough and mint chocolate chip. I was surprised of how good it was. I'm not so much of a sweet tooth and this want overbearing. Definitely give these guys a try
