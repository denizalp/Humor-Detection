I write this at 2:00 a.m. as I am woken up by an insatiable thirst for water. I wasn't going to bother to review this restaurant, but I want to be sure I have recorded our experience.  My husband and I ate at Arirang Korean Bbq Restaurant last night for the first and last time. \n\nWalked in and first noticed it very smokey and sticky. I don't think the ventilation was working then or if ever. The place needs a good scrub down. \n\nWe ordered the All you can Eat Korean BBQ.  We were brought a small portion of assorted meats and sea foods. Service started out ok, but got slower as we would ask for more. Each time we did ask for another round, the server would take our order with an uncomfortable judgment.  We ordered 3 times. \n\nThe food was nothing but OK. Nothing great tasting. No \"wow\" factor. Price was OK - $25 each and does not include dessert.  \n\nAll in all, I have to say that Chako was much better, cleaner, and not smokey. Service is also much kinder and efficient at Chako. The best part of the meal was once when we left our seats and the door opened to fresh, clean air. \n\nWould not recommend.
