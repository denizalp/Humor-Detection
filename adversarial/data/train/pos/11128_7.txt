Since moving out here from California, I'm always on the look out for local \"flavor\". I saw this place while exploring the new neighborhood and made a point to stop in. Came by on a friday afternoon and the place was pretty empty except for a few people in the separate dining area. I ordered the cheeseburger with gruyere, sweet potato fries and a chocolate shake. The burger came out dry even though I asked for it to be cooked medium. The cheese was pretty non existant. I really don't like making a big fuss about food, so I choked it down. The fries and shake were the highlight. The sweet potato fries were nice and crisp with the tender insides piping hot and my shake was one of the best I've ever had. If there were a way I could get a half star put on here I would because one the people sitting in that other room was Joe the owner. The way I figured that one out was because he looked like the caricature on the menu. Nice man, but I lied to him when I said my burger was good. Sorry!
