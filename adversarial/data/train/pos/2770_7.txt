I've never been to Fremont East before so going to Chow for lunch gave me my first opportunity to check the area out.  I came out here pretty much because I was in the mood for some good fried chicken and Chow's fried chicken looked amazing from their yelp pics.  I also found their menu pretty interesting since it was a mix of soul food and Asian favorites.\n\nBecause of the unique menu selections, I went with their fried chicken and then ordered their shrimp dumplings and Chinese Broccoli to mix things up.\n\n2 piece Dark Fried Chicken -- http:\/\/bit.ly\/2vLKqxp\nw\/ mini sweet corn muffins, house made sweet and spicy pickles\nAs expected this was some really tasty chicken!  I liked the crispy skin and and the chicken was juicy and had a lot of flavor.  The corn muffins that came with it were great as well.\n\nShrimp Dumplings -- http:\/\/bit.ly\/2vLe9Xr\npork belly bits, garlic soy\nThe Shrimp Dumplings were pretty tasty.  A little bit on the salty side from the sauce, but you can definitely taste the pork belly bits in the dumplings.\n\nSide of Chinese Broccoli -- http:\/\/bit.ly\/2vLVWc0\nI needed some greens to go with my meal and this fit that need very well.  \n\nChow is a very solid restaurant and was worth the drive to the Fremont East area.  The fried chicken was amazing and I would certainly come back for another round.  And despite reading mixed reviews about it, I would definitely go back again to try their loco moco because it looks really good!
