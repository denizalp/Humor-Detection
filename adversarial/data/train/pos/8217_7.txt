Wow! People from surrounding areas seem kind of mad at this place. It is not a dance club. It is Sun City folks, not Scottsdale. This place is about fun and people watching. \n\nThe pizza is great! We have had the white pizza several times and love the thin crust and toppings. \n\nFirst time we went, we were looking for something to do, So I called and asked if they had music. The woman replied, that they had 'R&B' that night. We went expecting a band. Instead, we got Ronnie and Bobbie  (?) who sing to songs AND wear costumes to fit the mood! It is very quirky, but fun. Tons of regulars hang out to dance and visit. we felt kind of out of place, since we were 10 - 20 years younger than the crowd, but they said hi as they walked by and made us feel included. The singers handed out small flags to wave during their rendition of 'Boogie- Woogie Bugle Boy' So, I got up and waved mine, mortifying my GF. Good fun!
