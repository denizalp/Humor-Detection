Most \"normal\" people keep photos of their kids on their person and show them off every chance they get. I however keep photos of pizza from Pizzeria Bianco saved in my phone and am happy to show them like a proud daddy. \n\nEveryone already knows that next door at Pizzeria Bianco, Paul is baking the absolutely best thin crush pizza in the country. The problem is takes three hours of anxious and painful waiting to get inside and sink your teeth into one of those delicious pies. \n\nSo what to do while waiting for the experience of a pizza lifetime? \n\nGrab a seat on the porch in front of Bar Bianco and tell stories and drink up. On a early spring day I can think of nothing better sitting outside drinking a cold pilsner with the faint smell of pizza making it was over to your nose. \n\nCome here in the summer and you will die from the intense heat. \n\nMinus 1 star for potential death from heatstroke
