With all the buffets in Vegas, how do you possibly begin to choose which one to go to? Well, that's what I am here for, to eat on your behalf. \n\nThe Good\n\n- easy to find\n- friendly servers, probably some of the more friendly staff I have met thus far\n- never had a problem with a huge crowd\/line in front of one particular item \n- lots of premium meat choices (beloved crab legs, lamb, etc.)\n- vegetarian friendly\n- line moved quickly @ 5:30pm on a Friday\n\nThe Bad\n\n- nothing remarkable about the food overall, v standard\n- could use more variety in ethnic food\n- dessert did not impress :(\n\nWhat did I end up eating personally?\n\n- Street Tacos\n- Too many different types of pasta\n- Crab legs\n- assorted desserts\n- tea, thank you lord\n\nEssentially the Bellagio Buffet gets the job done, but would not be my first choice if someone asked me which one to go to in Vegas.
