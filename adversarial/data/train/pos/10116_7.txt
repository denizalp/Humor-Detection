As many of my friends know, I love Sandwiches.....especially Jimmy Johns.  I stopped by this location and ordered a #9 Italian Club (Genoa Salami, Italian Capicola, Smoked Ham, Provolone Cheese, Lettuce, Tomato, Onion, Mayo, Italian Vinaigrette, $5.25) and added Hot Peppers, Vinegar Potato Chips ($1.39), and Soda ($.99).\nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/IRpZS7EmmBeSM7oBnDd5iw?select=8nTOvKrKJYePvqOUklYa0Q\nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/IRpZS7EmmBeSM7oBnDd5iw?select=1BQbD18J_MjO5NVKs53BuQ\n\nOf course the Sandwich was made within 2 minutes of ordering....I don't know how they can make a Sandwich so fast, but they do!\n\nThe Sandwich was excellent.....the Bread rocked of course and the Hot Peppers makes it so much better.\n\nWhile I was there, I looked at the menu and the JJ Gargantuan Sandwich piqued my interest....I will try that next time.\n\nReturn Factor - 100%
