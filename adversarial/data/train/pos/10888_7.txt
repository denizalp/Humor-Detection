What a gem!  Creative food, ultra helpful and friendly staff, and great flavor combinations as well as texture variety.\n\nHidden away on Flamingo and Decatur next to an unknown hair salon.  I had bookmarked this place away a month back and had forgotten about it until I saw some recent check-ins.  Decided I should go check this place out with the wife during the late night happy-hour.  Arrived around 12 with only one other table in the dining room.  The decor is very modern, but being dark wood-based, not museum like.  \n\nList of our food for the evening:\n\n* Amuse bouche - what?  Since when do you get amuse course at a non-fine-dining place?  Blood orange slices with yuzu and some candied quinoa.  Very tasty starter.  Little did we know we were in for more flavors and textures!\n\n* Anago (fried eel with sweet potatoe chips) - Probably the \"least\" flavorful dish of the night, but the star of the plate was the egg salad \"dressing\".  Puts a nice creamy texture onto the fried eel.  \n\n* Sake Orenji - If there was a signature dish to the place, I'd say this is it.  From the looks of the photo album, it seems everyone ordered this.  So we tried it and oh-man, was it amazing.  The trick to this dish is to pile a little of everything onto an orange and salmon slice, and eat it all at once.  The usual overbearing taste of salmon was somewhat masked by the orange slices and lemon oil's acidity, and the yuzu tobiko puts a sweet crunch into the bite.  \n\n* Konpa - similar to the Sake Orenji, except that we had more hamachi than salmon.  The crisp of the bellpeppers with a little twinge of spice from the jalape√±os makes this dish a great starter, as it whets your appetite for more.  We inhaled this dish under a minute, I swear.\n\n* Sashimi - uni and hamachi, both served with similar presentation.  Server had mentioned that they had \"live\" uni yesterday and we just missed out, so it almost made it a let-down to get our dish.  But, you could still taste the freshness in the uni, as there's no \"aftertaste\" that you'd get in bad servings of sea urchin.  The candied quinoa puts a crunch into the creaminess of the uni.  Great!  The yellowtail, on the other hand, was mostly dry except for a dab of japanese miso sauce.  However, eating it with some radish, the full flavors of the hamachi was brought out.  Very tasty indeed!\n\n* Agemaki - Decided that we should have at least ONE roll.  The california roll with snow crab looked enticing, but we settled on this one instead.  Served with baby yellowtail, a tiny slice of avocado and thai basil, slightly fried in tempura batter.  Yuzu kosho and hoisin sauce for dip.  Ultimately, another roll; however, the flavor of the fish was enhanced by the yuzu kosho, and the slightly crunchy texture of the tempura with the ultra tender fish was sublime.  I had no idea that hamachi could be so creamy.\n\n* Kudamono - Intermezzo for your mouth.  Mixture of daily fresh fruits of the chef's choosing.  Tonight we got berries with granny smith apple, topped with a homemade fish broth and basil strips.  Eh, fish broth on fruit?  Amazingly enough, you don't get any fish taste...instead you get ultra flavorful fruit, which washes your mouth clean of all prior fish!\n\n* Ishiyaki, wagyu beef - THE most interesting presentation for beef tataki I have ever seen, as you sear it yourself on a hot stone.  The beef is on a separate platter, doused in olive oil and salt\/pepper.  You then take the beef, put it on the hot stone for a count of 2 or 3 (each side), and dip into either a ponzu or mushroom sauce.  Both are very flavorful, but I found that just the beef by itself was enough.  ULTRA tender slices that just melt in your mouth.  This and the Sake Orenji are two must tries if you decide to visit!\n\n* Iraho (i think, forget the name) - salmon and white fish with heirloom tomatoes, candied quinoa, asian pears, serrano peppers, and mizuna leaf.  Lemon oil and yuzu complete the sauce.  This dish was similar to the konpa, except that the serrano pepper lends a spicier dish, which is cooled by the asian pear.  Again, mouth full of flavor along with good texture (recurring theme).\n\n* Oysters! - We were full, but looked through the menu one last time and spotted fresh oysters on the daily specials list.  The wife is a sucker for oysters, so we had to give it a go - I don't eat raw oysters, so can't really comment.  But considering that she said it was the most amazing sauce she's ever had on raw oysters, I'm going to assume they were good. :)\n\n* Ringo Lico - The manager touted this as her favorite dessert, so we had to give it a go.  Plate full of random bits and the game is to find the best combination of goodies. ;)  The pistachio butter is what really stands out - freshly made in house with roasted pistachios - really really flavorful.\n\nGreat place to check out if you like flavorful food with a creative twist.
