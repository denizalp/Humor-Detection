First off, this was most of our first time in Vegas, not to mention attending a show like this!\n\nFrom the initial inquiry, Darren and Ben were really helpful and provided me with the best guidance on how to make the night memorable for the bride to be. We were a large group so was able to get the complimentary party bus pick up. The busy arrived just in time (little did we know Ben was our driver) for our 8:50pm pick up - We were greeted by a handsome host (Nathan) and took off right away. We had a wonderful time during our ride (highly recommended to start off the night!). Upon arrival, Nathan was kind enough to walk us to the V Theater and helped me with the tickets. He took our party to a bar on the same level of the entrance of the theater and our group was able to purchase drinks and wait in the lounge area. We opt out of the VIP tickets (usually comes with a drink ticket - drink prices were average $12-$14\/drink- Souvenir cup will get you a discount off next drink) and still had a great time! \n\nDon't forget you cash ladies! 15 minutes before the show started, Ben came out with a bag of Aussie money which can be exchanged for cash (we loved the idea of NOT throwing real money around!). We were escorted right away after the brief introduction from Ben....and the rest is history. You really have to go there to find out what happens next! \n\nEveryone couldn't stop talking about it. We laughed and scream...We had a great time and would recommend to any group looking for a good time.
