Hummm where do I start.  I guess I came in expecting more.  Having worked in a couple of successful small locally owned health food market cafe combos while still in college I know what is possible.  \nI was truly expecting more health food and suppliments.  This was more of an upscale QT (I like QTs) with a cafe and a mixed bag of suppliments.  It wasdifficult manuvering through the cafe tables and meandering patrons to get to the market section. \nWhen it came time to check out....maybe I was lost but I didn't find a market only register, just the one at the cafe front was staffed.  It seemed awkward and they acted like they are not used to seeing market items at the register.  \nAlso remember to bring your own bags.  I bought 8 items, forgot my bag and I had to use their basket to get my stuff to my car and then bring their basket back.  \nI did enjoy my fresh squeezed orange juice I picked up for the road.  \nI may be back to try the cafe, but I will continue to go to Sprouts for my health food needs.
