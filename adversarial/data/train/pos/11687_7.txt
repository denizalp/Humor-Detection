Burn-outs and hippies bring pizza and sandwiches right to your door! (I am fortunate enough to live near this location).  At first it was annoying that I would place the order online with explicit instructions for where my apartment was located only to find that the hippie delivery guy from Z would call my cell phone (sometimes I'd hear it ring and sometimes not) for further information.  Hijinx invariably ensue as I verbally administer the same instructions over the phone.  Now I just come to expect that when I order delivery from Z Pizza the guy who brings it to me will have blazed one up in the car on the half mile ride over to my place and will need some help getting to the door.\n\nAnd then, the order surprise! Until they fixed the online ordering system you truly never knew what would actually be in your custom calzone.  Now it's at least got the right ingredients, although they interpret them a little loosely sometimes (last night, for example, I requested sauce, sauce, and more sauce and they gave me only one tiny cup). \n\nI love the calzone with wheat crust (I love that you can get wheat at all), the turkey sandwich with cranberry, and my husband loves the Santa Fe pizza (which I personally find a little revolting).  The food is tasty and they bring it to my house.  I like that.  It's better than ordering from Pizza Megalopolis or some other insanely corporatized chain.  Even though Z is a chain they \"keep it real\" and operate like a mom and pop.  Plus they keep our local Granola Crowd employed so they can turn around and spend their cash at other local spots.  \n\nGotta love the Z.
