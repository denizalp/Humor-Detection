When I wake up super hungry, I need something that's going to hit the spot. I usually head to Tupelo Honey for comfort food, comfy environment, and friendly staff. There's a reason it's always packed and reservation is always recommended--but don't worry, if you forget to make one, they'll try to accommodate you.\n\nTupelo Honey is basically my favorite casual brunch spot in Charlotte right now. It's the perfect place for jeans and sweater, and a long list of my favorite Southern brunch options: Southern Shakshuka, Avocado Toast & Eggs,  Shrimp & Grits, Caramelized Squash & Burrata Toast, Shoo Mercy Omelet, Fried Okra and more. \n\nSouthern Taste\nSouther hospitality.\nIt's a win all around. \n\nFive Yelps
