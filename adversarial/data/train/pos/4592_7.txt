If you're up on the athletic shoe game but don't want to spend hundreds of $$$ on vintage kicks, then Shiekh is the chic place to shop.  Pricing is manageable and their inventory is broad.  You'll find everything from Creative Recreation to Supra to Fila to Adidas lifestyle.\n\nThey have something for everyone, if you're the type that rocks skinny jeans, the type that swears by Nike, or the type that's never grown out of 90s hip-hop fashion.\n\nAnd if they don't have your size, they'll have it shipped from another store at no charge.  The store is located on the lower level near Nordstrom (another shoe mecca...but moreso for the ladies).  There really isn't another option in this mall if you're all about staying fresh.\n\nCat daddy approved...
