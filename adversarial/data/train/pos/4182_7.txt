This place is dive bar in the most perfect form. Cheap, Strong drinks, cool bartenders, happy customers. I seriously love this place. I always have a great time whenever I end up here. \n\nBrand new music player (it's way too modern to be called a juke box) and it doubles as a photo booth that will send or upload your photos directly. Great idea!\n\nThis is my absolute favorite gay bar in town. Everyone is always so friendly. \nDrinks are strong (No credit card machine, so bring cash) but not expensive.\n\nExcellent Staff. Even though Andrew doesn't work here anymore the other bartenders are awesome. Josh barely looks old enough to be in the bar, but he is such a delight. Never without a smile on his face. Gary is the hot, bearded one that makes an excellent drink. \n\nI just love this place!
