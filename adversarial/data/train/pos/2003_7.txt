This is your typical motel for those who are looking for a cheap thrill without the frills.  The Howard Johnson name pretty much pays the bills.  The great part about this place is that it is right across the street from the MGM Grand and also around the corner from the infamous Las Vegas Strip.  This place charges a $100 room deposit only to be released a few days after checkout.  Lots of parking and rooms are in the back both upstairs and downstairs.  Once again this is NOT a 4-star place and you will not spend most your time in the room while you are in Vegas except for laying your head on a pillow at night (or whenever you rest) but the Howard Johnson serves its purpose.  If you are too fancy for a place like this, The Strip and Downtown are available at your convenience.
