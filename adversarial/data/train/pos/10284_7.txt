Hostile Grape at M Resort. \n\nOk so I am not the biggest wine connoisseur in the world however am always open to trying something new. Not that I don't like wine...don't get me wrong..maybe it is just the lack of wine knowledge perhaps? \n\nI don't even know how to drink it properly, I know you are supposed to sip and swirl and sip and swirl, some people even rinse? I don't get that sipping something and spitting it out? Huh? I would much rather just swallow and be done with it...anyhow moving right along. \n\nI drink more like a Sailor, I like the strong stuff, shots of Jack, Wild Turkey, Crown Royal, etc etc. \n\nI was not enthused about going with my gal pal \"wine tasting\" but sometimes we all do stuff we don't really want to or like. I love my friends and will accompany them pretty much anywhere. I know I know, I am just so fun to be around :) lololol I can't blame my friends. \n\nThis turned out to be awesome we bought a tasting credit card thingy loaded with $20 bucks we split it and went around pouring, sipping, swishing, and swirling our sweet mouths away. We got a bit tipsy after awhile, man wine can give a buzz! I did not know that! After all was said and done we left with $5 bucks left on our card good for next time! Cheap and we were sampling like crazy! \n\nThis cellar is gorgeous, nice and dark, sexy furniture to relax on and enjoy your spirits. The Hostile Grape employees rock! They are so knowledgeable and more than happy to educate and answer any questions regarding the wines and cellar itself. You can sample and then buy a bottle on the spot if wanting to take a nice gift home. \n\nI am a fan of this beautiful wine cellar with a sophisticated lounge atmosphere. Many thanks to my BFF Lorena for bringing me here! \n\nThere is also a bar as well so if you are in the mood for a mixed drink or perhaps a beer you may do so! \n\n160 Wines by the Glass. \nExperienced wine enthusiasts will revel in the selection of boutique wines and handcrafted cocktails, while novice connoisseurs may sample several wines in small pours using the Hostile Grape's innovative dispensing system. This system uses prepaid tasting cards that allow guests to enjoy pours of one, three or five ounces. \n\nHours of Operation: \n\nThurs. - Sun. 5:00pm - 1:00am
