Situated 23 floors above the Strip in the MO Hotel, the restaurant offers great views of our cities most famous landmark, and an even better view of it at night. We were seated away from the window in a more casual setting, the three of us enjoyed the atmosphere, we were able to take a couple sneak peaks of the kitchen. Definitely recommend if you are here on a date, I'd reserve a table by the window.\n\nIt was a tough decision to make, it was my first time there so I was on the fence about choosing the tasting menu or a la carte. I let our server choose, and he recommended the four course tasting menu, and I chose to do the wine pairing as well. \n\nBread basket included a cheddar bacon, cherry walnut, french baguette and a fennel herb roll along with salted and unsalted imported butter. \n\n*Rolly Gassman Pinot Gris\n\n*Ravioli of Foie Gras, seared langoustine with dried orange zezette bouillon, Paris mushroom salad\n\n*Kallstadler Annsberg Spatlese Chardonnay\n\n*Turbot, poached fillet in vadouvan butter, grapefruit fondue with tandoori leek, celery & snow peas julienne\n\n*Marotti Campi Orgiolo\n\n*Wagyu Beef, peppercorn steak, red cabbage marmalade, white beans, lentil & shiitake\n\n*Samos Necar Vintage \n\n*Grand Dessert- Arugula financier, pistachio chantilly, green apple tuile & sorbet, crumbly shortbread, black current syrup, apple & passion fruit marmalade, multicolored meringue, polignac almond, ganache with old rum, lemon jelly with limoncello, chocolate ice cream, mango veloute & wedges, raspberry sorbet & coconut milk with lime.\n\nI enjoyed my meal, but I felt dessert was bit of a let down. I wasn't completely impressed with the tasting menu dessert. Although, the white truffle soufle that was ordered off the menu was amazing. \n\nTo top off the night, Chef Gagnaire was in house and made his way around the restaurant to each table and introduced himself which was a nice addition to our meal.\n\nI still stand firm that Pierre owes me a make out session for what I paid for dinner and wine pairing.
