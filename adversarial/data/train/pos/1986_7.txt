I was the first patient at this particular Quick Care.  The first!  I still have the mug to prove it.  Since then I've been back a couple of times and after my last trip, I'll brave the ER before going here ever again.\n\nThe first time I went, when I was the first patient on the first day they were open, I was greeted by a grumpy doctor who acted like I was a big thorn in her side.  My ankle was terribly swollen.  She asked me how I did it and I told her I'd been dancing.  \"Not very effectively,\" she snorted with derision.  Gee, lady, thanks, I already feel like crap because my ankle is the size of a watermelon and now you're going to degrade me!  You rule!\n\nThe last time I came in and I was terribly dehydrated after being sick for 3 days.  Turns out I had a terrible kidney infection and the flu.  Awesome.  They start me on the slowest.  IV. Drip.  Ever.  If I hadn't asked them to speed it up, I would have been there for 4 hours.  As it was, I was there for 2.5.  Despite the fact that I had an IV in my hand, they still gave me shots in the butt.  When I went back to the ER days later because nothing they gave me helped anything, the nurses were appalled when I told them what went on,\n\nI don't think I've ever seen a friendly face here.  And when you're sick, really, that makes a big difference.
