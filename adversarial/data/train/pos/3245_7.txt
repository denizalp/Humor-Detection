My husband and I purchased a vehicle from this dealership recently, a 2016 Jeep Cherokee Limited.  Our experience was very pleasant.  Our salesman, Charlie, was very accommodating, an easy person to deal with!  We have absolutely no complaints and would recommend this dealership when purchasing a new car. Charlie spent a lot of time with us because we were going back and forth with another dealership.  He was very patient at all times and delivered what he promised!  Charlie even threw in a free set of winter rubber mats!
