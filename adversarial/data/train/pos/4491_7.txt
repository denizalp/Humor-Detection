Born and raised in Europe, we were in for a surprise regarding home furnishing stores when we first moved here...In the absence of contemporary design in Charlotte we had to resort to Ethan Allen and the likes... until we found ByDesign that is!\n\nBeen there many times and bought both delivered\/assembled as well as self pick-up\/self-assemble pieces.\n\nWhile I agree with one of the previous reviewers that this is probably not the best furniture to assemble and disassemble 5 times while you're moving accross the country, I think you have to be fair when you're discussing what you get for your money.\n\nMost of the stuff you can buy here are knock-off copies of much pricier designs. For example a copy of the original Macintosh chair (original $5k) for $400...\n\nYes - if you have the money go with the original - much better quality and design. However, comparing ByDesign to a certain \"skandinavian furnishing\" company in Charlotte is unfair in my opinion. ByDesign is trying to serve a niche that is looking for \"high contemporary design\" at (somewhat) casual prices.\n\nWe take ByDesign for what it is and what they're good at: Special contemporary pieces that you can't find anywhere else in Charlotte. \n\nAnd if I need that $30 bookshelf for my media room  I go \"skandinavian\" ;-)
