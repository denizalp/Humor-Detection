I just exorcised some demons in my nastiest review ever, and then felt very yucky and negative. So I decided I needed to write a nice review to balance things out, and started thinking about some of my favorite things.\n\nZ'Tejas and Z's happy hour is one of those favorite things. I look forward to unwinding on the patio after a long day\/week. It's pretty fab - all appetizers are half off. Half off!!! Which means you get those orgasmic Shrimp Tostada Bites, the fun Tejas Trio, quesadillas, and a whole bunch of other stuff for around 5 bucks a pop. Nice!\n\nDrinks aren't that deeply discounted (a dollar off drafts & margaritas, I think) which is a bit of a bummer. But I would rather have a really well-done drink\/quality draft and pay a bit more than have worthless, average drinks for half price.\n\nHappy hour is always reliable in my experience. The regular menu is good as well (I do like their burgers and the chile relleno is PHENOMENAL) and the cornbread you get with happy hour or regular service is so beautiful when slathered with their whipped honey butter, I want to marry it.\n\nConsistent service, good selection, quality food, a touch of the southwest, unique to the West (those who call it a chain invoke thoughts of Applebee's and TGIF and Z is absolutely no freaking chain)...\n\n...Overall, I heart Z.
