Decor is very hip and pretty (especially liked the lychee-looking chandeliers), service is friendly and quick. Their menu is tiny and food quite oily. Small portions left us unsatisfied and feeling like we paid a lot for too little. Had the dhal appetizer, which was the highlight. Their homemade shrimp crackers are quite greasy and served with ~one teaspoon of peanut sauce. The vegetarian noodles were oily and spicy - remember the cheap Chinese food you had as a poor student in university??? Yeah! Just like that!! Except not cheap...
