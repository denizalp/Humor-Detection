I purchased a car a year ago with Carmax and it has been nothing but a problem, a problem they cannot fix I should say. In the last few months my car has been in for the same problem and they have failed to fix it. It seems they take it in let it sit for a week and then tell me it is done and come get it without doing anything to it. \n\nJust got it back from them having it for a week and guess what it is back there this morning for the same problem. I have spent so much money on rental car fees just so they cannot fix the problem. Also when I got it back this last time they had put over 300 miles on my car, for what, not like the problem got fixed. There were items left in my car like someone had used it to move. Also a beer bottle cap and receipt for lunch. So obviously they are letting their mechanics use customers cars for personal reasons. If it was not a warranty item I would be taking to a real mechanic!\n\nThey are the worst!!!! I would never buy from them ever again. Sad thing is I have recommeded them to so many people and always talked so highly of them.\n\nOh I failed to mention that my car was in an accident in 2008 and they never told me when I purchased the car, I found it myself on the jeep site since jeep had done the repairs. Nice to know they take in and sale wrecks! Also it has had a ton of electrical issues prior to me owning the car that they never told me. I love the jeep website so helpful when needing to find out service records.\n\nOn another note, I turned in a 2007 Honda Element that was in AWESOME shape, They low balled me on trade in and sold it for $5K more. They are such a rip off!!!!\n\nDO NOT EVER USE CARMAX!!!! THEY SUCK!!!!
