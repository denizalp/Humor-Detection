I was really excited when I heard there was a new ramen place in town, but I guess I had too high of expectations for this place.\n\nWhen I first arrived, I thought that the atmosphere was really great and the decorations were pretty awesome.  I sat at a table where there were ropes hanging from the ceiling to the bottom separating us from the other table.  I thought it was pretty cool.  The lighting in there was dim, so it felt like a great intimate place for a date, or just a small group of friends.\n\nThe ramen was what I was excited about, but the their Small Bites were what was amazing to me.  Definitely try the Ika Geso (fried squid tenticles), Takoyaki (fried octopus ball) and Hamachi Jalapenos.  The Tuna Salad is pretty wicked as well!  If you go there, TRY THE SMALL BITES!!!  Now as for their ramen, it's a different story.  I had ordered the Tonkostu Ramen and asked for it to be spicy.  I did not taste any spiciness in it or did I really taste any flavor as it was very bland.  It really made me sad that it was bland.  I have since come back since my first time and I feel that the place is stepping up their game.  It seems that the Tonkatsu Ramen is getting more flavorful.\n\nThe service here is really nice.  I quite enjoyed our waiter as he was friendly and very patient to explain things when we weren't sure what it was that we were ordering or wanted more of an explanation.
