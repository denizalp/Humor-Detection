We stayed at Le Westin Montreal over labor day weekend.  It truly is in a great location with close proximity to Old Montreal, blocks away from Chinatown and a Bixi station right down the street.  Our room was spacious and clean. And as with other Westin hotels, our room had the oh- so-comfortable heavenly bed. I had read in previous reviews on yelp and tripadvisor that this is a fairly newer hotel and thus has some minor kinks to work out.  One of our dresser drawers kept getting jammed while another was missing a knob.  Not a big deal, although I think that in general hotel rooms need to include dressers that provide more than three drawers for storage, especially for overpackers like myself.  We also did not have a mini fridge on our room but were able to put request through the front desk and received a fridge the next day.  Overall, service and location were great.  I wouldn't mind staying here again next time around, especially since I need to rack up more starwood points.
