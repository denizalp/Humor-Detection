I was Shopping, in Penn.Mac, the other day and a customer was in front of me buying Almonds, she asked a Q. about the price the Cashier responded with a Smart A--s. answer, The Same Cashier waited on me and She was Very Very Rude, and she gave mea  with a Smart A--s. answer. that was not the first time. i have a idea, Get rid of those Cashiers,  Fire Them! i will not go back until they are gone. i hope the Owner read's this?
