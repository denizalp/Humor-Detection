I tried three flavours (don't remember name, don't care to) - a chocolate with blue icing, a mint chocolate one, and just your typical vanilla cupcake.\n\nThey all taste like something I could make at home but only I'd do it better.\n\nThe cake parts are dry and honestly, it's just the look you're paying for.\n\nThe worst part about this place (and hey, I was PSYCHED to go visit this place, my sister surprised me with a $20 gift cert) is that I took out my phone to snap some pics of my cupcakes and the chic behind the counter was all \"sorry no photos\".\n\nI looked at her with my jaw dropped - did she just say something THAT stupid? \n\nIN this DAY and AGE, did someone with a total lack of understanding the power of social media and the BASICS of running a business just utter the phrase \"sorry no photos\" ????\n\nHere's my phrase .. \"You're an idiot\".. on wait, here's a better one \"This place sucks\"...or how about \"Spend money elsewhere\".
