The worst service.  They havent been opened long enough for the menus to be falling apart and dirty.  No big deal, but as I waited for soo long for service I began to notice problems.  My friend and I wanted to order a few items and split them.  The rude lady said its $6 per plate to split...I said the item is only $7 and you want me to pay a total of $12 to split a dish?  We may as well get two.  We got up and left.\n\n8.9.16 \nMagniolia M. \nI am not sure who she was, but she was the only person working besides the chef.  We were one of the first people in the restaurant so should've been served quicker than we were.  \nHonestly, I don't think you should charge $2 to share a plate either.  Especially, if it's $6 or $7 & we wanted to share multiple items so when I do the math it didn't seem right.  Also because the competitors around you do not charge a sharing fee.  \nThank you for the response.
