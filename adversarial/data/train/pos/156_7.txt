What Tapas is to Spain, Dim Sum is to Chinese. Guu is to Japanese. \n\nAt first, it might be a little hidden to the naked *tourist* eye but once you find it and open those large heavy doors. You'll be hit in the face with a ton of Asians shouting incoherent Japanese greetings. \n\nPROTIP: Give yourself a good half hour wait. Come popularity, come longer wait times. Part of the trade-off, I suppose.\n\nThe atmosphere is open, with lots of chatter and big heavy, school-lunch style tables. For those more claustrophobic, you might want to reconsider your dinner options for, at Guu, you might potentially share tables with other guests. Otherwise, get close, cheer to a beer and have fun with your friends!\n\nThis is the perfect place for large groups, birthdays and perhaps even a fun date. Stay clear if you're going for romantic and quiet.\n\nBelieve the hype, this place is unique, fun and wild and the food is DELICIOUS. So delicious in fact that you can taste the authenticity. We sampled a variety of items off the menu, some more \"crazier\" than others but all in all it was a good experience and can't wait to go back. My mouth is just watering from thinking about it. mmmmm.\n\nPS. don't be frightened as they yell at you on your way out, they're just saying goodbye! :)
