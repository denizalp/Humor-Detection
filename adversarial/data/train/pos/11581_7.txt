Not a place I'd go back to. Why? Service and employees were just weird. I walked up from the park area, approached the hostess. There were a ton of seating options from firepit comfy seating to the uncomfortable bar area. I asked if they offer flights, and I assume the hostess assumed that I wasn't interested in eating or relaxing and she pointed me to the bar. As it turns out, considering the uncomfortable high stools and at least one of the bartenders, the bar should be the last place that the hostess should've sat me at. \n\nThey have Four Roses Bourbon Barrel aged beer! I thought I was sold. After the first and horrible bartender asked if I wanted a food menu but never delivered, I should've left after I finished my beer. Buuut, I asked for a menu. Then, guess what? I asked if I could place my order. Don't worry though, she catered to the couple who sat across the bar from me, so not everyone gets bad service. \n\nI finally ordered the fried pickles. They consisted of spears and hamburger slice kosher dill pickles in a smooth batter and came with a side of ranch. Not the best fried pickles I've had, but not the worst. \n\nA lot of items featured on pictures on Yelp are no longer offered. For example, the mussels, don't set your heart on them. And the happy hours have changed. I'm not sure if it's a common change up, but the Wednesday that I was there, happy hour was Monday-Saturday 3-6:30. During Happy hour, it's $2 off Pedal Haus Beers, but guess what? That didn't include the barrel aged beer nor did she tell me that until later. It also includes $5 glasses of wine. I noticed the healthy pours of wine, so if that's your thing, it's a good deal. $5 margaritas, $2 off well drinks and $2 off appetizers. They also have all day Happy Hour on Sundays, but those specials are a little different.
