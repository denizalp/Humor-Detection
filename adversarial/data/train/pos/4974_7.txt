Place can't pass the slamming door test, which is tough for any motel to pass actually. You might get woken up from a door slammer, but you can always get revenge by slamming your own door in the AM to wake someone else up. AC was cranking, flat screen TV has numerous channels not found in a normal hotel and the wifi which is free worked to perfection. Best part of this place was that coffee machine down in the lobby which produced starbucks-like French Vanilla or mocha drinks free of charge as well. Try to book online or ask for \"coupon\" rate as those are the best deals. Some poor tourists were forking over $79 a night, while I was enjoying $34 rates for the same room. If this really is the world's biggest Super 8, it's still pretty small, but not a bad place to stay for 2-4 nights.
