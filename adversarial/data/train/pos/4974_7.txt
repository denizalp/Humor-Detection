You know that quote \"Children are the orgasm of life\"? \n\nWELL IT'S WRONG.\n\nVic's hotdogs are THE orgasm of life. They take your tastebuds and your tummy to the most fulfilling places. There's no other way to describe it. Your tastebuds will climax. The wait in line is the foreplay and the contact with your salivating tongue the climax. \n\nAnd you'll want to do it again and again. \nTRUST ME--You won't mind the cleanup afterwards ;.p.
