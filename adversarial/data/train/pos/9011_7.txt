This coffee shop is easy to miss if you are cruising down the street and not paying attention as it has a very narrow store front.\nParking will be tricky if there are already a bunch of people in the restaurant. However, they do have a place to park your car right outside the front door.\nWhen we were there laid back jazz music was playing in the background.\nThe owner knew all about his coffee and served up our coffees exactly as specified.\nA nice little place to hang out and get some work done or maybe to organize a weekly coffee group.
