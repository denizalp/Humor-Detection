I just returned from an All Inclusive near Cancun. Flights were on time, baggage made it ok, the flight crew were great and the free food provided wasn't horrible (egg muffin down, sandwich back). The little dinky old school tv's were difficult to see. The movies were new but tv programming was old reruns of Big Bang Theory and How I Met your Mother, so not what I'd consider 'family' friendly.\n \nThe upgrade to Elite didn't seem worth it us ($50 pp\/flight). Yes, we got extra leg room and seat selection. But no priority boarding call was even made in Calgary and many customers who weren't Elite checked in at the Elite counter anyway. Nothing was said to them. We weren't offered a free head set, nor did our bags come off in priority on either end, supposedly additional Elite perks.\n \nI found it interesting that they tagged your carry-on luggage, presumably to ensure bags met the size standard but still many people were way over the allowed size so I'm not sure what the purpose of tagging these was.\n \nI get that used blankets are kinda gross but $12 to buy a blanket is pretty outrageous. Bring your own travel blanket!\n \nI was not impressed that on our first morning, someone from Sunwing Tours called our room at 8am and woke us up, to ensure we were at the 'meeting' at 9:30am, which was made to sound like we MUST attend and turn in a card to guarantee our transportation back. When in fact, it was just a sales meeting for tours. You can hand in your card for transportation to the Sunwing desk any time. While we were there we signed up for one tour organized by Sunwing Nexus. It was just too many people, like 70, and resulted in a lot of 'hurry up and wait'. You couldn't even hear the guides through the crowd. I probably wouldn't book tours with them again.\n \nSpecial shout out to the flight crew who were all very pleasant, kept the drinks coming and tried their best to make everyone happy.
