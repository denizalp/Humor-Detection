Weird how the majority of the first several reviewers have only reviewed this restaurant. Anyway, skeptical thoughts aside, this place does the job when you have a curry craving quickly and cheaply. \nIt's different from the majority of Indian restaurants in that you order up front, & food is quickly made and packaged in styrofoam for ya. Open seating area. \nTheir regular portions are great for the price! You get a load of rice of your choice (pulao or jeera), a side salad, and a good amount of the entr√©e you ordered. Satisfies my curry craving, I leave with a happy stomach, and I always have leftovers for the next meal, which is great. \nDishes start around $8, which I would consider a good price for Indian cuisine. I've tried the malai kofta (curry w\/ vegetable balls), chicken masala & butter chicken (as suggested from reviews) with naan. Both rich and flavorful. Glad this place opened right across the street as I will be back frequently.
