So...this is a hard review for me. I just had amazing Chinese food this past week....maybe New York is different? \n\nI ordered delivery. He told me 45 mins, which I hoped was like pizza and really showed up in 20. Nope, 45 mins exact almost. \n\nThe food was packaged nicely, and was warm. \n\nIt was a little soggy...which I understand cause it is delivery....but you can get Panda, drive 45 mins, and it still is crispy. \n\nI got the orange chicken, and the flavor was good. Some times I had that....\"what am I eating\" moment. Especially with the egg roll. I am not sure what that was. That was not fresh and or good. \n\nWhen I started this review I was thinking I would give them another shot....but I rather just go to Panda. It would have saved me $5. \n\nThey were very nice over the phone!!
