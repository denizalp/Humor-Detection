3.5 stars.\n\nMy friends and I totally lucked out and got to stay here for free because my cousin had an extra room. SCORE!!\n\nThe room was clean, bed was pretty comfy, and I loved how we could connect our iPod to the radio. So fun for getting ready to go out! \n\nService is also great! We asked for 4 more towels, and a guy came SUPER fast to get them to us. But he gave us like 8 instead AND he was sooo nice! \n\nThe hotel is in a pretty good location because it's across the street from Wynn and Encore. But girls, for your feet's sake I'd definitely recommend taking a taxi to get to the clubs on the other side because the walking distance is a lot longer than it seems.\n\nOverall, TI is a decent hotel but I'd still prefer staying at the Palazzo with its hugeee suite-style rooms. But if you're on a tighter budget or wanna save some money, TI is an excellent choice!
