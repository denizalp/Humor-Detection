I came here on a whim for dinner and it was by far my best meal in Montreal! From the food, to the drinks, ambience, and staff...perfect.\n\nWe started with the oysters and burrata. The maple mignonette was the perfect compliment to the fresh oysters. We also really enjoyed the crispy black chickpeas with the burrata. I had the pumpkin ravioli as my main while my date had the lobster risotto. I could eat the pumpkin raviolis for dinner every single night, they were that good. Perfectly al dente in a light but flavorful sauce. \n\nGreat staff- friendly and attentive, loved the wine our waitress suggested. I hope to be back the next time I'm in town.
