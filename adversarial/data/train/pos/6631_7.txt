Went here with Wendytronâ„¢ for their Sunday night drag show. Wendy got purse checked, but I didn't because my purse is tiny. Hey, I could be hiding a Deringer in there, but now you'll never know, haha! While we waited for the show to start, there was Karaoke in the basement lounge. We both got a couple of turns at the mic, but while we were waiting for our 3rd turn, we got bumped and then removed altogether from the queue. \n\nBecause the Cast of Wicked was there!! Yeah, I wouldn't want to follow them either :D. Perfectly acceptable bump! And the MC was a total sweetheart. In fact, the entire staff is friendly and amazing. I saw one staff member balance a tub full of glasses in the palm of his hand, while he expertly untangled his pants hem from a lady's broken bar stool in a quick, fluid motion.\n\nI won't spoil the show for anyone who hasn't been, but seriously, go. So much fun - and - no cover if you show up before 10pm.
