Although some of the items are a bit on the pricey side for takeaway food, Olive & Ivy does great coffee and pizzas.  $1.73 for a single banana?  They have it Fry's for .19 cents, so that's a huge markup.  Not too good for a budget traveler for sure. They do redeem themselves for having great breakfast items with prices comparable to other eateries in the airport.  Great Irish oats with apples! Their airport menu is not that extensive though but as a jet setter. I can honestly say that this is one of the best places to get your on-board meals before getting on the airplane. Service is friendly, and the line moves pretty quick!\n\nAIRPORT: PHX  T4- A SIDE
