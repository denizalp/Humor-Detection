A trendy looking bar...in the airport, hmmm. Wait, in the Phoenix airport?!? No way, impossible, not a chance. These were all the things I assumed before I actually arrived at Barfly before my flight to Mexico a few weeks ago, and I could not have been more wrong.\n\nI wish I was there longer and actually had a chance to sample some of their offered dishes, which honest to god sounded pretty decent. It's still the airport so plan on paying the awesome prices of $10 a beer etc but at least you can spend your pre-flight time drinking on a cozy leather couch watching tube rather than the alternative Fox Sports bar in every other terminal.
