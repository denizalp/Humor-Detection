This Timmies really pushes my buttons, because I want to give them a high rating because they're nice people, but almost every time I go, there seems to be a problem. \n\nMy main concern is how several times (always in the drivethru) my order ends up being wrong and I have to end up driving back in the line again. Sometimes it's missing the cream cheese I asked for on my bagel, one time they forgot to give me one of my drinks! (I bought 3 and forgot about one) \n\nBesides all the mishaps, the store is full of kind employees which is why I'm giving 3 stars for my 2.5 star review. Thankfully they're respectful enough to fix the situation usually (unless I find out they messed up when I'm already at home\/work), and there's nothing more to it. \n\nFood is standard at this Timmies just like other Timmies. This one is 24hours also which is a plus! If I ever lose wifi at home, I will (and have) come here to spend some time catching up on what the rest of the world is doing. \n\nOverall, 2.5 stars. Friendly people who constantly get your order wrong but maybe eventually, they'll get it right.
