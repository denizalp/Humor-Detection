Ok so first I will say that I'm not the type to buy baby stuff at places like this.  That being said... it's a great place to pick-up unique little gifts... which is what I did when I was there.  \n\nDon't get me wrong, their stuff is great but, they ask for 1 item what I'll spend on a year's worth of stuff when I buy it pre-loved from other mothers or from Ikea.  To each their own.   :)\n\nMight see ya there.
