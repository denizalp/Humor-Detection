After I finished facilitating my meeting for work, my co-worker and I decided to get a bite to eat.  We were starving, we were hungry, we were cranky.  Unfortunately for us it was still early so everywhere we wanted to go was still not opened.. That's when we decided to give this place a try.  \n\nThe restaurant was clean, service was good, staff was helpful and nice, the food was unique and good, plenty of lighting and unfortunately the price is kinda high, but no big deal. \n\nOverall a good little place, we had a nice time, and I would probably only comeback....
