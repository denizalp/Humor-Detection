WOW what a great idea and amazing service. I was a little nervous to go after reading some of the reviews. I must say it looks like they have worked out all the bugs after letting go some problem staff. As most people know one bad employee can mess up everything. The lady who helped me was amazing, she had so much knowledge about the different denim and my body type. If your like me and can never find jeans that fit (long legs small waist) you need to hit up Lawless. Even if you don't want jeans the shop is cool. You can see how they make them in the shop!! And it don't get more \" buy local\" than this. So hit up your local farmers market then hit up Lawless.
