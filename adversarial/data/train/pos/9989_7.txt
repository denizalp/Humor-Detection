I feel like a big fat jerk for not writing this glowing review of Lady Luck and Uncle Josh sooner. Someone should stick me with tiny needles :-p\n\nPer the recommendation of Amy D, I went to see U.J. last summer for a full back piece I wanted done. I had some ideas and I handed them over. Two weeks later I went back and Josh had whipped them up into a spectacular visual demonstration. I was super stoked to get working.\n\nThe tattoo took over a year to complete, which was completely my fault, but I loved every minute of the 15+ hours we put into it. Each time I went, Josh was incredibly friendly, professional, and dedicated to his craft. \n\nThe rest of the staff is really friendly, and supportive of the other artists. They come over to each others booths to check out work and give props versus being snide or competitive, which I have seen in many studios.\n\nI couldn't be happier with the outcome of my tattoo, and the quality, healing times, instruction were absolutely perfect. This was my 9th tattoo, and it was the best by far. Highly Recommended.
