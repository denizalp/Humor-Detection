Delightful, delectable, de-lovely! Driving up the street I could smell the wonderful aromas before even exiting the car! One of the best dining experiences in Pittsburgh. Walking in I soaked in the busy atmosphere and found the last seat at the bar as we waited to be sat. Pinot Please! We didn't wait long this night.\n\nFor a starter I ordered the famous moules, they were out of this world! Plump, juicy, tender, and without the often found chewiness. The classic sauce consisted of white wine, shallots, garlic and light cream. I ate all the bread just to sop it up. I don't usually like to get full on filler bread but I couldn't help it. You can also have them prepared with Red curry coconut milk, lime juice, basil and cilantro or tomato saffron, and fennel broth. A-mazing!\n\nIntellectual types make the modish community. The whole place hums with wine, brews, food pouring out of the kitchen, and conversation.  It is a minimalistic design but so warm, and cozy as you sit at the candle lit mosaic tables in the huge storefront windows. The twinkling lights in the trees and the starry night seem massive outside, so European. They have more seating such as booths and other tables in the back but I loved where we were placed!\n\nMy entree came out steaming as I fluffed the perfectly cooked noodles. I decided on the ragu bolognese since I had been craving it from HB's E2 dinner choice awhile back. A rich ragu made of beef, pork, and sweet sausage braised in red wine and herbs had my mouth singing! It's watering so bad right now as I close my eyes and remember it. Oh dang! fasting sucks right now! I had a large to go since I had eaten the bread but I was happy for the lunch a day later. I can't wait to visit again and again.
