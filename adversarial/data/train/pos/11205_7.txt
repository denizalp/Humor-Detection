Goodbye to the precious locks. \n\nMy husband and I went in to get his gorgeous hair chopped off. It was a safe 18 inches and the woman cutting his hair just slashed it off. She grabbed three handfuls and roughly cut them off. There was no wiggle room for length at this point. Then she washed his hair.\n\nDuring the haircut she does not ask the usual stylist to costumer questions. She remains pretty silent and then out of the blue she asks, \"where did you two meet?\" That's an odd question to inquire of someone you have barely spoken to but since we are an interracial couple, we understood why she was asking it...\n\nShe runs her fingers through the back of his hair and layers it nicely. This motion has dried the back hair, but leaves the front wet. The front sides of his hair remain barely touched. We ask her to trim down the front, and she takes off about a centimeter. We ask for more, she then makes the edges more even, less than a centimeter shorter. We give up and leave with his uneven hair. \n\nWe contact them through email and they agree to fix his hair. She tries to fix it but it's still heavier in the front.\n\nSo if you're white, you'll be alright.\nif you're a person of color, you may want to find another.
