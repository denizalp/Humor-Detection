Food was amazing BUUUUTTTTTTT... the servers lack manners and friendliness!! They tried charging us for an extra person and when trying to show them that they got rude. Before all that, you could tell they were trying to push us to leave! Let's not forget them basically throwing the plates of food down on the table.
