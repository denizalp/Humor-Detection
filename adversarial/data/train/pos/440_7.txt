I really like Lee's and being so close to another big liquor store it has to be tough to compete but they do.  Although smaller and maybe not as \"ritzy\" I think the Lee's staff has the 'other guy' beat hands down on knowledge of staff and willingness to help.\n\nI've gone in looking for a specific wine and vintage and instead of just we don't have it the answer was \"let's see if we can find it\" and I had a very interesting conversation with the sales rep who made another recommendation that was great.\n\n.... and this is pretty typical of every visit.  if they don't have it but it can be found, they will get it!
