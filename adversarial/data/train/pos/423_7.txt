Sometimes I wonder why I sold my soul to the devil aka Best Buy. I'm involved in their reward zone program (Premier Silver Status) and have a credit card with them. This location has awful customer service yet I keep going back because it's convenient.\n\nIn 2010, I purchased from them: a 50\" Samsung Plasma HDTV, a TV stand, TV accessories, Kinect, Kinect Games, Xbox Games, a Nikon D3100, and Nikon accessories.\n\nThey remodeled their store, which is a plus. They just need to do the same thing with their employees.
