Southern Comfort Food\n\nI have wanted to try Mrs White's for some time, so today I put Mrs. White's on our agenda for lunch. We arrived about noon. We were greeted, seated immediately, and given the one page menu. \n\nI  had already planned on ordering the chicken after reading all the yelp reviews however, I  was  unsure what sides to have. Mrs White's offers so many southern style sides, black-eyed peas, cabbage, collard greens, mac & cheese, rice and gravy, potato salad, and so much more.\n\n On this visit I order the 3 piece chicken, potato salad, and rice and gravy. Our waitress reminded us that the chicken is made to order so may be a short wait.  As we waited we were treated  with cornbread and honey.  The cornbread was warm and made with real course cornmeal not processed cornmeal, it was very good. \n\nOur chicken arrived in a short time and was served piping-hot.\nThe chicken portion are big, three large pieces. The skin on the chicken was very crispy and had a lot of flavor. However, the chicken was just average, maybe I was expecting more and the gravy and rice lacked flavor, but the potato salad was delicious.\n\nWhile dining, we noticed  that the tables were filled pretty regularly and the seats at the counter were filled the entire time. I like that the walls at Mrs White's were covered with white boards and felt pens were  available to leave messages on the boards. Parking is tight at Mrs White's but it's worth a visit.
