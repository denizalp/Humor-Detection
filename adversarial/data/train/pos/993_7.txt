I was happy to see a Panera open in my neighborhood because I've been carrying around a My Panera card that I can only use when I go back to St. Louis.  When I did live there Panera was my goto in the winter mainly for some quick, inexpensive comfort food, like a grilled cheese and a nice bowl of soup.  \n\nDue to the hot temps here in AZ, I've looked for lighter options.  I've used the drive-thru only at this Panera 4 times and overall have had good experiences.  I've gotten bagels and iced green tea twice and also tried their Mediterranean veggie sandwich and the Roasted Turkey and Avocado BLT.  All have been very fresh and tasty and only one time they forgot the napkins, but I was headed home so it was no big deal.  \n\nI feel for them and all the negative reviews.  This is a tough to please neighborhood with an inordinate number of people speeding around in their luxury SUVs acting like they are the only ones on the road, and the only ones in the restaurant.  If you don't cater to them you are in big trouble.  Hopefully this location can get their issues straightened out.  I know from the St. Louis perspective, Panera is a great corporate citizen which does a lot in the community and gives back to many charities that fight hunger.  I don't know if they are doing that here in AZ, but the next time I'm in I'm going to ask.
