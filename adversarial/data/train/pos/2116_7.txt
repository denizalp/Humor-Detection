Tasty fast and fresh Korean bowls. Excellent base to toppings ratio. Friendly, patient service. Here, you move left to right like Qdoba and Chipotle and choose a rice or noodle base, 1 or more of 4 protein choices of well-marinated beef bulgogi (mmmm!), spicy pork (yes!), chicken, or tofu (which my kids loved), up to 6 veggie-based toppings including fresh-tasting kimchi and more toppings like seaweed strips, sesame seeds and oil, and a fried egg ($1 extra- do it!) and 1 out of 5 sauces of zero (teryaki) to increased spiciness. These ingredients make a beautiful presentation. No tummy ache.\n\nAt $9.95 with the fried egg, it's a legitimate satisfying lunch option. They also offer a hot soupy version in a stone bowl that I'd love to slurp next time.\n\nTIPS:\n**While they sell bottled drinks, they provide free self-serve water (plain, cucumber, and lemon) and hot corn tea.\n\n**Awards stamp card available - buy 4 bowls, get a free drink with your 5th.
