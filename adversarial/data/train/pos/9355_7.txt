This is like the Chipotle of sushi rolls. You pick what form you want: rice bowl or sushi burrito. Pick a wrapper: soy paper or nori. Pick your rice: white rice or brown rice. Pick a sushi burrito concoction or create your own. Pick your sides: taro chips or edamame. Do you want extra protein? Pay extra. They also have tofu as a protein source.\n\nI tried the Kodiak with brown rice and fresh salmon. This normally has grilled salmon so, the fresh salmon was extra. The fish quality was good.\n\nThe create-your-own option is neat. The combinations you can make...oh, the possibilities!\n\nThe restaurant is tiny with only a few tables. I'd recommend taking your food to-go because of the lack of seating and you'll end up smelling like cooking oil. The service is great though. The price per sushi burrito is about $9. You can get tiny sushi rolls\/maki from other restaurants for about $8 but a sushi burrito is roughly 2-3 times bigger than a maki.
