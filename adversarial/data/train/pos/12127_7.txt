Great experience! I am not a runner, but I'm trying to get through the couch to 5k app. I got fitted for custom insoles and found some new shoes that I'm in love with. They have you run on a treadmill for 30 seconds to examine your gait and then have you stand on a pad to imprint the soles. The soles are supposed to last 4,000+ miles, so they will far outlast multiple pairs of running shoes (which last about 400-500 miles each if I remember correctly).\n\nThe staff here is exceptionally friendly and knowledgeable. I really appreciate them helping me out! The custom insoles and my new Adidas Boost Vengeful shoes are pretty sick. I can't say I like running but I do like how my feet feel!
