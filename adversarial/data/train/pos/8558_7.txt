Decent Mexican with a bit of a sports bar vibe to it. Like so many of the others in the Charlotte area - no better and no worse. A-OK.\n\nI had a burrito with chicken sort of thing, which came with the usual rice and beans. It was tasty and it was hot. It was good. My daughter chose a chimichanga and she enjoyed hers. The chips and salsa was good, but not the chunky style I prefer - this was more like a spicy tomato sauce.\n\nWould I go here again? Sure, why not?
