Although I love having clean, white, healthy teeth, I do not love going to the dentist. I had a not-so-friendly dentist growing up who has forever ruined me in terms of being happy about an impending dentist appointment. That said, Dest Family Dentistry at Gateway is my current dentist and I've been quite happy with their service. I've seen three different dentists and all have been very competent. \n\nThey are always on time for my appointment and for a general cleaning have you in-and-out in 30 minutes or so. Outside of general check-ups, I've had teeth whitening, a cavity filled, a mouthgaurd made, and a crown. I do take very good care of my teeth, you see, but I grind them at night and thus am inadvertently causing myself issues. I figure I'm single-handedly paying for Dr. Dest's kids to go to college, but not much I can do about that. Thank goodness for dental insurance. \n\nIf you work in the uptown area and need to find somewhere to go during the day, Dest Family Dentistry is just a quick trolley ride from the corner of Trade and Tryon. If it's a nice day you could even take a stroll down there for some exercise. Convenient location (in the same building as the Gateway YMCA) and good service has kept this dental office on my calendar every six months for over two years now.
