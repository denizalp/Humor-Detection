After reading Connie C.'s review and seeing \"mojito lamb chops\" on the menu, I was fully intrigued and sucked in. Yes, you read that right...\n\nMOJITO. LAMB. CHOPS.\n\nQuite the new swanky scene in Vegas. Dim lights, upbeat tunes, gorgeous view of the strip...I was saddened to have had to leave early to meet a friend who landed a bit earlier than expected. However, we were able to stay long enough to enjoy my 1.5 glass of Cotton Candy Kiss. It was amusing watching the waiter pour the drink into my martini glass filled with a fluff of pink cotton candy as it melted away into red liquid courage. With an abundant amount of crushed Lifesaver candy coated around the rim, each sip was full of fruity sweetness. Perfectly portioned Grey Goose and juices, the drink delivered an awesome kick without the jolting taste of alcohol. Loved it!\n\nOur waiter understood our situation and packed everything to go without any hesitation. Literally running back to our room so the food wouldn't get cold, we unpacked everything with a fork in hand and chowed down with the quickness.\n\nThe mojito lamb chops lived up to their reputation! Blanketed with a minty lime glaze, each bite was packed with intense flavor. I found the meat to be a tad tough, but I enjoyed the non-gamy taste of the lamb. With 3 fairly large cuts, this could be served more as an entree than an appetizer. Highly recommended to anyone who swings by First Food & Bar.\n\nAccompanied with a side order of truffle mac and cheese, this was a delicious first meal in Vegas. Prices are very reasonable considering LV is known for raping everyone's wallet in every possible way. I hope to come back next time and stay long enough to enjoy the ambiance and full experience.
