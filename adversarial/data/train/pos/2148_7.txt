Beware! You assume all responsibility for what you buy at this store. They will only refund or exchange unopened items. If you open the box and the item is faulty they WILL NOT EXCHANGE IT!!!  \n\nREPEAT THEY WILL NOT EXCHANGE A FAULTY ITEM!!!\n\nMy experience was a servo (pretty spendy one!) that did not work out of the box. I returned within ten days with the reciept and they didn't care. Said I had to send it to the manufacture.  If thats the case you might as well order stuff on line and pocket the savings.
