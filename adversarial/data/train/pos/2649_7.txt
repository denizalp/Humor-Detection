We went to Cactus Jacks this week looking for a car. We had bad credit and having a hard time with a low down. We saw their ads on Craigslist that state \"$500 down? Full time job? You're approved?\" We went in and they demanded to run our credit even though they say no credit check. Then we told them we have $500 down. They said for that amount we get to pick from 3 cars on the lot. They were older model cars - late 90s, over 150K on them, and worse than taking the bus in all seriousness.
