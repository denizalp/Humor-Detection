The food is good however, I took my out of town family there and we wanted to order a Gyro\n\nfilled with just lamb and the proprietor said they cannot fulfill that request. The Gyro has to be \n\nmixed with beef. I did not understand what the big deal was, It is a Greek restaurant and \n\nGyros are usually filled with Lamb. A good restaurant should accommodate its customers\n\nBecause we pay the bills. I decided not to ever return and not give Yassou my business.
