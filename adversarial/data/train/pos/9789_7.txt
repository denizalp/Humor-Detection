I got to say, since I've been to Ka Chi many times (at different locations), my 1st time at this location was pretty disappointing.  \n\nI'll 1st point out the positives and say that the atmosphere's nice, it's pretty clean and the service is not bad (they're pretty quick).  However, I do feel like a key fundamental for any Korean restaurant is the perfect Pork Bone Soup (GamJaTang) and I feel there there were so many fundamentals of a Pork Bone Soup that they are seriously lacking.\n\nI ordered the spicy version of it and portion-wise, it's fine and it's stacked up pretty nicely.  The problem I had were the following.\n\n- The vegetables (kimchi and bean sprouts) were plopped on top of my pork bone soup and I just feel that they should be in the broth, simmering and stewing in it to get that flavour.  Also, is it normal to be served a lime wedge with my pork bone soup? It's the 1st time it's happened to me.\n\n- The pork bones themselves were just overly inconsistent.  Out of the 4 bones I had, only half of them had the proper, fall off the bone texture that I just expect out of a GamJaTang.  The other two were tough to chew on and I thought overall they were kind of tasteless (felt all they did with the bones was boiled them in just water).\n\n- The pork bone broth itself is just lacking.  It doesn't really have a whole lot of complexity and flavour to it, to me it just tastes like spicy salted pork broth.  There's normally like Perilla seeds and other seasonings that gives it that distinctive taste.  \n\nSide dishes were pretty good, although I must comment that the seaweed, while texture was very good, was grossly underseasoned.  \n\nAll in all, this is not the Kachi that I once loved.
