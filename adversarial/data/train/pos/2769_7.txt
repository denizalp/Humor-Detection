I ordered Chen and Wok for take out on Saturday. I must say it was pretty darn good! I will give it an a-ok for now even a 3.5, but will return to try more dishes. I'm sure it will creep to 4 stars.\n\nWhat I ordered: \n\nSweet and Sour Chicken- slightly dissapointed because there wasn't a lot of sweet and sour sauce on the chicken chunks. But overall pretty tasty.\n\nVegetable Egg Foo Yung- yummy! The sauce that it came in wasn't just a plain brown gravy, it was an actual sauce with ginger and other seasonings that took it out of the boring realm.\n\nHouse Lo-Mein- That was pretty good. The noodles were a little soggy but still flavorful.\n\nHouse Fried Rice- I would suggest getting any of the other fried rice that they offer. I was hoping for a good mix of all the meats but only ended up with 2 shrimp out of the entire carton. Other than that, the rice was good! I actually really liked it.\n\nEgg Rolls- I love a well seasoned egg roll. I only ate one, but wished I had ordered a lot more or didn't have to share my other one. Oh well.. \n\nFor about 30 dollars, I was able to feed 3 people HUGE plates of food and still had leftovers. \n\nI think Chen and Wok will be my new Chinese Takeout from now on!
