To be fair, I will at least give one star because it would be wrong of me to not give any at all when I didn't get the opportunity to try their food.  Reading reviews, all seemed very good and I really wanted to give this place a try.\nI went inside restaurant to place an order to go and it all went downhill from there. \nI asked girl waitress if orange chicken is fried or??  I asked her if she would recommend it.  She responded \"white' people like it.  I was caught by surprise at first and then thought maybe I didn't hear her right.  \nI than asked if she would recommend Mongolian beef.  Once again, she responded \"white\" people, Americans seem to like it.  WOW!!  I did hear her right.  White, Yellow, Black or whatever......I would hope we're all Americans here!!!\nI than said, do you recommend anything?  Chicken Curry was the only thing she could recommend.\nSo, there you go.  Let's hire waitresses who can only suggest a dish based off of the color of your skin and who doesn't seem to impressed with anything else the restaurant has to offer on their menu except for the Chicken Curry.  WOW!!!!!\nMy family was upset that I didn't say anything while I was there.  I guess I figured it starts from the top, so they know they kind of employees they have hired and are okay with it all.\nShame on me that I didn't call News 3!  I don't find myself to be that kind of person, but this experience has changed me.....opened my eyes......I won't make that mistake again!
