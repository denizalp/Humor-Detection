After a failed attempt during my last trip here I finally was able to give Olives a try. \n\nHubs and I had lunch outside overlooking the fountains. I ordered the crab pasta off the special menu of the day ($25.) Hubs ordered the crab stuffed prawns scampi ($26.) We shared a mixed greens salad ($14.) Total without gratuity was $70.27.\n\nWe devoured the complimentary bread basket with spreads and olives. The assorted bread was great I was in carb heaven, the cheese crisp was good and the spreads were delicious on the fresh bread. \n\nOur entrees took about 30 minutes and was served all together. I thought the salad would be served first. The pasta was cooked perfectly and the crab meat was sweet. The portion was perfect almost too much pasta (and that is being said by an Italian) Hubs enjoyed the stuffed prawns. He said it was probably the best meal during our trip. The mixed green salad was just okay nothing exciting nor memorable. \n\nService was wonderful. Our waitress was attentive and friendly. The water glasses were always full and they remove the plates after both of us were finished. \n\nI couldn't have asked for much more it was a nice meal outside with beautiful surroundings and perfect weather with Hubs.
