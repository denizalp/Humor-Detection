Dropped by with a group of 8 on a warm Wednesday night - patio was packed by 6:30 when we arrived, but waited across the street at the Abbey for about 25 minutes and had a beer.\n\nThe patio at BCG is beautiful. 4500 sq ft. WHAT? Yeah, that's right. It's a monster. Varnished picnic style tables line it for giant and small group, a large spit for roasting a pig (every Weds) and a lower terrace with a waterfall and pond in the back. They've also recently upgraded and thrown in two large TVs at the front of the patio in case something special is going on (like the playoffs- go Bruins).\n\nThe food is served family-style - big trays to share.\n\nHighlights: The flaming sausage starter. Wicked presentation. Flaming sausage cooked right in front of you. Flames licking everywhere  - its a wonder no one got burned, but it was really fun to watch.\n\nThe seafood platter at 65$ seems pricey but the amount of food that came with was astounding. Lobster, crab, mussels, calamari, shrimp, some other things, and all in a delicious Portuguese sauce. I don't remember what it tasted like, so I'm just going to call it that. Everyone loved it though.\n\nWe also got a few mixed meat platters and some rice. \n\nHere's a really good highlight: for 13$ you get a pitcher of Keith's. I'm in heaven. \n\nVery friendly waitstaff who even gave us a chocolate mouse and a complimentary pitcher when someone said it was their birthday. The final bill was about 30% lower than you'd expect to pay. Wicked.\n\nEu amo este lugar\n\nFIVE FLAMIN PATS\npatpatpatpatapt\n\nttyn,\n-PAT
