This is possible the best milk tea I've had in my entire life. I'm so glad I got to try Nos Th√©s on my second to last day in Montreal because it meant I could return on my last day, too! \n\nWe walked in and it was pretty crowded inside. One of the waitresses sat us at a table quickly and we had a few minutes to scan the immense menu. There is something for everyone here. Craving some Japanese food? They have that here! Noodles? Sure! Passion fruit milk tea?? I know, I too was skeptical at first. I love milk tea and I love passion fruit.... but together?? Magical. It was perfect. I didn't even need to add boba to make me happy. \n\nThe passion fruit milk tea honestly didn't look any different than normal milk tea, which I didn't expect. I definitely want to try all the flavors they offer, because it seems like they use legit ingredients. You can also choose the sugar level and amount of ice, which I'm glad they ask about instead of making assumptions. This way your drink comes out perfect every time! \n\nI also ordered the popcorn chicken, which was ok. Not the best I ever had, but people come here for the drinks, not the food.... speaking of food though, my friend ordered the mushroom medley on rice and she was amazed. It was packed with mushrooms and smothered in delicious sauce that we will try to replicate soon. \n\nOur waitress was kind and patient. This place is great; highly recommended!!
