Has this cafe always been here?  I have no idea.  I discovered this cafe was here when we were setting up an event for work, and my boss said we were getting lunch here.  Who am I to complain about free lunch?\n\nYou walk up to the counter, order, and find a seat.  There is real silverware and plates, but we ended up taking food to go.  They provided us with plasticware and napkins.\n\nThe menu is small.  There were four sandwich options, two soups, a salad, and a few other things.  What I really liked is that each sandwich came with a side.  I got the buffalo chicken breast sandwich ($8.75), which had buffalo chicken breast, America cheese, lettuce, tomatoes, and pickles.  The sandwich was large and tasted good.  I had two little cheese and sun-dried tomato risotto bites.  They were delicious, and I wish there had been more.  Apparently the chips for a side are good as well, and there were quite a few of those in a portion.\n\nThe service was friendly, and everyone was happy with lunch!
