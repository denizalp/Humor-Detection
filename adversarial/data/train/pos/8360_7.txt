For the few times where my brother and I have gone directly to the Hard Rock Casino after I disembark from my flight, we always make sure we stop by here.  He doesn't eat the food anymore since he overdid it in his UNLV days, but I always insist that if I don't get some of this, my gambling will be salty for the rest of the trip.  If it's not my first meal, this has proven itself to be 100% true while the other trips have me go home even or ahead.\n\nIt's boilerplate to the other locations - the only differing thing is that this is not frequented by the throngs of tourists like the Sahara location.
