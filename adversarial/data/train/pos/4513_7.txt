The food here is kind of hit or miss. Some of the dishes are better than others; you kind of just have to try things to figure out if you like them or not. I have generally found it to be tasty though.\n\nNot related to the food itself but I looked up this restaurant online and it's owned\/run by this weird organization called Supreme Master Television, or something. The leader of it is this Asian woman named Supreme Master Ching Hai. I'm not even making this up: http:\/\/www.suprememastertv.com\/loving-hut... it's all really weird and confusing.\n\nAt the restaurant there is even a painting on the wall that was made by Ching Hai (her signature is on it). You will also find a some paraphernalia about this organization. The waitress that served me today was eerily friendly and calm, but maybe I'm just creeped out by her because I can't stop thinking about that Supreme Master stuff.
