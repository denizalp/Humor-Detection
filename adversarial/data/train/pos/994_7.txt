I can't believe I even set foot into this place. Gave it chance and thought it would turn out to be a charming little place but it certainly wasn't. Filthy tables, filthy bar, filthy pool tables and not to mention the filthy guys blatantly staring at you from the bar. Did stay long enough to try the food. Do so if you're brave.
