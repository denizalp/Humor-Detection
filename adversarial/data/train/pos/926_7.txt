Coming down here was a bit of a trek, but Eddie came highly recommended. Be warned it's not in pacific mall but across the street at splendid china tower. I walked in showed the guys my cracked iPhone 5 screen and was told no problem! be about twenty minutes. All the guys there seemed like top notch gentleman who know how to keep customers happy. My phone has that new sleek look and I can't stop thinking I got a new phone! I'm so grateful for this excellent service. I would recommend anyone go there it's worth the drive (or any commute). Did I mention he put a screen protector on and threw in a case? What a guy.
