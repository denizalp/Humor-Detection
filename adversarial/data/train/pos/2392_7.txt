I agree with a lot of the reviews. I have gone a few times. The first couple of times it was really cool to see the place and let your dogs play while having a drink. After a few times of going, it seemed that the staff was very rude. They didn't pick up after the animals (Even though the pup-parents are really responsible for doing so) My dog stepped in a huge pile of poo and I had to clean it up. The staff is very short with you. I asked for a drink while inside the bar with my dog on the leash and they told me I had to go outside. I went one early afternoon to take the dog for a groom and noticed that there were dogs playing. So I went to open the door so they could paly until we were ready for our groom. The girls rushed over to me and said I don't go in there. With completely no explanation. I then asked, why?...and I got a rude repsonse...these dogs are boarders! Well holy shit, Don't you think they would want another one to play with? Isn't that the concept here? My dog is completely up to date on his shots. Grooming only happened a few times and he now hates going there. Hmmm... I haven't been back. I actually \"know of\" someone who may or may not have been affiliated with the place previously and they said it's a joke there.\n\nWe drink our beer at home and go to the dog park regularly now. Lucky Dog isn't the place we want to be.
