I came here very early morning at around 10am so I didn't run into any busy traffic with waiters, waiting for food or anything like that. Our waiter was very nice and helped me order since it was my first time being here. I ordered a pancake with bananas it was sweet n tasty, what I like about the pancakes here is that the ingredients (bananas, chocolate chips,etc) are actually baked in the pancakes they are not just tossed on top. Another great thing about the pancakes they are actually baked it makes a great difference they are sooo fluffy in the inside and on the outer side of the pancake crispy, yummy! I only ate half of the pancake. I also ordered there breakfast platter; 2 sunny side eggs were warm and tasty I ate only one , 2 sizzling sausages ate half of 1, and evenly cooked hash browns only ate a spoonful. Lastly I ordered a side of biscuits and gravy and omg they are the best I have ever tasted I highly recommend trying them out! They come with 2 biscuits I only ate one I so wanted to save the other one for later. I tried a little bit of everything I didn't finish everything and not because the food wasn't to die for but, because I did order a lot of food couldn't fit everything in my stomach. I guess I got carried away lol I so wanted to try everything on the menu.
