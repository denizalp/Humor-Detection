Luxe has so much potential.  It simply needs to do more of what it does well and drop the pale imitations.\n\nTHE DRINKS:  I start here because they do not take reservations for parties under 6.  So, if you are on a date, or with a few friends, you WILL start with drinks at the bar as you gaze at the empty tables that remain mysteriously unfilled despite your gnawing hunger.\n\nThere are worse fates, because the drinks are really good.  The cocktail menu is creative and fun-- not the usual list of boring girlie martinis.  I had the Bedazzled-- Chinese 5 spice powder syrup in sparkling wine.  Not too sweet and the spices built up subtley but nicely.  Mon cher chou had a vodka\/ pineapple\/ basil concoction that sounds like it shouldn't work but does-- really does.  The rest of our party contented themselves with a good beer and wine selection.\n\nTHE FOOD:  Ah, finally.  The small plates and appetizers are phenomenal.  The calamari was tender , with a flavorful, chunky, tomato based sauce.  The duck ragout ravioli was complex, rich but not heavy.  My crab cake was blissfully deviod of excess filler.  \n\nAfter that I could not wait for the main course.  The main course, I said.  Main course?  Oh dear, there are two.  As in slightly more than one.  Neither was spectacular.  Not bad, mind you, but nowhere near the quality of the small plates.\n\nThere was pizza.  How dreadfully, dreadfully boring to wait eons for \"gourmet\" pizza.  Why does Luxe insist on focusing on something so unspectacular on its dinner menu when nearly every other hip trendy place did the very same thing ages ago and did it better?  It's not innovative.  It's not exciting.  I'll go to Bar Cento for pizza-- cheaper, better and less of a wait.  Why do this when they excell at small plates.?  Do tapas!  Do small plate combinations!  Do what you do best!!!!!\n\nTHE SERVICE:  Yes, darling, I understand when your book is published\/ movie is made\/ poetry is being lauded by kings\/ art is appreciated I will be serving YOU.  However, in the meantime, could you at least bring me some bloody silverware !?!  Thanks, then.\n\nThe front of the house is lovely-- the hostess, bar staff and cocktail servers were very nice.\n\nTHE ATMOSPHERE:  Gorgeous.  On par with the small plates.  The place is stunning, with modern, innovative takes on tin ceilings, chandeliers and moody lighting.\n\nSo go, but just order several small plates and some lovely cocktails.  Intimate that you are a publisher or a movie producer and I am sure your service will be better.
