People have been raving about this place to me for the past five years.  I finally made it.  I could smell fresh  hashbrowns and pancakes cooking in the parking lot.  The pancakes were great, the hashbrowns were made to perfections.  The food is wholesome for the most part.  I ordered the special which was sausage and spinach.  The eggs were too buttery and watered down.  This was probably do to the fact the spinach was cooked down with too much fluids.  Instead of flipping the eggs so they were fluffy it appeared as the cooked took the end of the spatula and chopped the eggs.  Big mistake.  Orange juice was nice and fresh.  Overall is was not a bad meal but not the hype people made it up to be.  I met the owner who was very very nice.  She seemed to know how her food was cooked.  I just wish she looked at my plate before it went out.  The wait staff was not overly friendly and seemed a little blah for being a Monday morning.  Over all it was ok but not worth waiting in a long line like they normally have.  There are plenty of other places who will do a mediocre job and have better waitstaff.
