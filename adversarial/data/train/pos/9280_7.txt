probably the WORST bar i've ever been to, this place thoroughly STINKS. \n\nthe bartender had a look on his face like he swallowed a fly. he saunters over to me, i tell him what i want (a Malibu 7, but what other kinds of Malibu Rum do they have?). 5 minutes later he comes back. they only have one kind, so i order it. 5 minutes later, he shuffles back, takes my money, and 5 minutes later, he stumbles back and while he's looking away from me, lays down my change and walks off. scumbag. no tip for you, LOSER! never again will i dirty the bottom of my shoes in this crap-hole. \n\nP.S. there was hardly anyone in there. no doubt this fly-eating slug scared them all away.
