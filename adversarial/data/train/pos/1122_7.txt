They have bought themselves a lawsuit as of today!  My aunt sued them several years ago for the exact same thing and won. Today at 930 am they locked our unit. Rents due at noon and they decided they \"didnt want to continue\" our relationship.... Today was the 30th day they were trying so hard to avoid. The corp office said they have nothing to do with these decisions....i guess they enjoy paying those 1000.00 fines!\nI have nothing to loose they are discriminating against me at this point and its funny because it has nothing to do with rent payment!\nThey could have received great marks and lots of referrals but now I am forced to remove their literature from all the University boards and flyers.... Way way too bad
