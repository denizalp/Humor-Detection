***YELP 100 CHALLENGE 94\/100***\n\nI'm not all too familiar with Russian culture and cuisine but I had fun browsing thru items they carried at Jones Market. Even though small in size, they have a lot of Russian and European delicacies in stock. Deli items, baked goods, various fruits & nuts both dried and fresh, chocolates galore, they have them displayed neatly and priced clearly. \n\nWhat brought me to this place is the Kinder Joy ($2.39) each, I have been calling around trying to find these pesky lol little eggs that the kids go crazy about. There is not a day that my daughter fails to mention them be it in passing or hoping that Santa won't forget to bring her some on Christmas. Naturally my instinct is to panic hahaha as I know Kinder Surprise eggs are banned here in the US. Thanks to some awesome yelpers who pointed me to the right direction, I was able to snag some. They're not the Kinder surprise eggs (those are still banned) but the Kinder Joy. The toys are bigger and pose less of a choking hazard, suitable for 4 year olds and above. They also carry other brands of surprise eggs for $1.99 each.\n\nAmong the items I picked up are hummus $2.99, pita bread $0.65 and some Napoleon $1.79 that everyone was scooping up while I was browsing the pastry\/cake selections. No wonder, that sucker was tasty! They also carry different kinds of Milka chocolates priced at $1.79 each which is cheaper than International Market. Everyone in the store was super nice and very helpful. Definitely will be going back.
