I love \"family style\" Japanese restaurants. Even though \"family style\" may remind you of Bucca Di Beppo, I assure you this is nothing like that!  \n\nLet's break it down for you... order a plethora of items and dig in! I love when you can trust a server to pick out the best items and just let them go for it!  We just told them a price point per person we wanted to stick with and off he went.  Honestly, for $60 per person, we ended up with A LOT of food.  I was a little nervous, considering Japanese can get pricey, but by the end of the meal I could hardly finish the last dish (although I did:)\n\nI think the marinade for each sashimi we got made each one, topped with the extremely fresh fish made those the stand outs of the evening for me. I thought they were all killer and would recommend any of these:\n\nYellowtail Jalapeno - garlic, cilantro, calamansi Soy with a fried jalapeno to top\nSalmon Wasabi - wasabi cr√®me, lemon Soy, crispy shallot, chives\nFluke Soy Salt - chili Oil, soy salt, citrus\nKobe Sashimi - a play on thinly sliced kobe beef, yumm-o!\n\nWe also ordered the Cod Bibb Lettuce Cups. I thought the contrast between the cool lettuce and fried cod was really good.  I know this wasn't a favorite of the table, but I really enjoyed it!\n\nOur last course was the sushi. The angry tuna roll was pretty amazing. I mean, deep fried sushi roll? Who wouldn't love it! The seared albacore was good and so was the yellowtail, but angry tuna, the star of the show, for sushi at least. \n\nI would definitely recommend making a reservation before you get to Vegas, but one thing I will note is that we came in around 7pm and the place was dead, so you may be able to squeeze in last minute.  Ambiance is classy yet hip, so wear your hot cocktail dresses ladies and for dudes... something other than jeans and sneakers will do!
