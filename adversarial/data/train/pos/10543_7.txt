I was told that I needed to take my GF out on a date to dinner and a show. I wanted to see Absinthe again but after checking the restaurant prices at Caesars and being told a trip to McDonald's wasnt going to cut it to night we picked Rons steakhouse.\n\nDon't let the crazy people in and around the Casino scare you. This is a great place to escape the heat, the hustle and bustle of the strip and better yet most of the people in the casino couldnt afford the restaurant so its quaint and yet classy sit down experience you dont want to miss.\n\nWe both had a 3 course steak dinner of perfectly cooked Fillets, house salads that came wrapped in tasty cucumber bowls and for desert it was cheesecake.\n\nThe server was an Expat from France and very knowledgeable about all the dishes. He was even very entertaining as he made jokes about himself and his not being from America. It was very personal and engaging and all the staff made you feel at home. (So much so an elderly lady had a personal cell phone conversation in the booth next to us like she was sitting in her own living room. I hope whomever she was talking to gets her meds figures out, the laundry folded and the pets fed) \n\nIf you are in the mood for a great steak dinner at a great price that will impress just about anyone; GIVE THEM A TRY!
