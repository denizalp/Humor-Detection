I was next door for a UYE and as a group it was decided we who were already stuffed \"needed\" dessert. So off we went. I had not been here before so I followed the lead of those that had and ordered a tSoynami. The base is a soy soft serve \"ice cream\". They have different add ins just like if you were getting frozen yogurt. Mine combo was labeled \"life's a Peach\". It had chunks of peach, granola and caramel. Very good. I certainly could not tell it wasn't dairy based.
