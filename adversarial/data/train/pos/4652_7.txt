I cannot not write a review about Zipps, especially because my jaw literally dropped to see it did not have a five star yelp rating. Seriously? This place is the best.\n\nApparently the naysayers have not tried their chicken skewers with golden medium sauce. CLEARLY, they have also not enjoyed said skewers with a giant beer for like $4! It must be that they didn't get a side of onion rings or even a freaking side salad at this place! If they came, it must have been during a blackout because they have such a great TV set up. Those giant TVs that merge together to form one mega giant TV? They must have been facing towards a wall instead.  Also they must have come during the like one hour that Zipps is not running a happy hour special.\n\nThis place is a god send for the Ahwatukee community. Its a total hit. Apparently their actual customers are not reviewing this place because seriously it is PACKED any time any event happens. It has a great atmosphere and is consistent. \n\nReally, they don't pay me to say this. I am just an epic Zipps fan who enjoys the finer things in life with a ball game on, a cold beer in one hand and a chicken skewer in the other. Life at Zipps is life well spent.
