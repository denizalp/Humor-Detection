I came here for their high tea so I can't comment on rooms or any of the other amenities this hotel has to offer.\n\nAhh the King Eddy...when you walk in you just want to straighten your posture, pull out the manners your momma taught you and act like you know what you are doing.  \n\nThe lobby of the hotel is beautiful - at the front they have a seating area with some lovely plush chairs\/sofas with the really high backs so you feel like royalty sitting in them.  There are also giant black chess pieces that anchor the seating area.  There is a restaurant right at the entrance and one towards the back (i believe it's called the Victorian room) and this is where high tea is served.\n\nAs this was my first time, I wasn't sure where high tea would be so I asked the concierge.  Instead of just pointing me in a vague general direction, he came around the desk and walked me almost to my destination. Now that's class and service!\n\nThe high tea menu is 3 main prix fixed menu choices - one with savoury sandwiches, one with desserts and in the summer they have a combo deal (sammies and desserts).  The combo is $45 while the other 2 are $35 so for $10 more it just makes sense to go with this option.  The $45 option also comes with a small strawberry\/lemonade drink as well.  There is also a vegetarian menu option as well. \n\nI'm not sure if the sammies\/desserts change ever once in awhile but everything was delicious - there was one sandwich - buttermilk fried chicken on some slaw on a sesame seed bun....explosions of deliciousness in my mouth.  This was my fave sandwich.\n\nThe desserts were the typical scones, jams, chocolate mousse cake, a berry parfait (oh my!).  As we went for a friend's birthday they even brought a piece of chocolate cake over with a candle!\n\nYou choose your tea from a variety of loose leaf teas.  I had the Kind Eddy specialty blend - it's made specifically for the hotel and it was divine.  A robust flavour of the tea similar to that I am used to (chai).  \n\nThe service is impeccable here - from being knowledgeable about the teas to making sure we had enough hot water to showing you exactly where the washrooms are (instead of just pointing) makes me feel like a high flying player.  I sauntered out of here..pinky finger up...full and in bliss.
