They showed up to impound my car and never asked me for my keys they dragged my 04 ford expoler two car lengths and onto a flat bed truck. They ruin brand new tires, pull transmission while it was not in gear, imposed frame damage to front suspension and bent muffler. These guys should not be city impound, they are going to cost us alot of money. Either way I have lawyer lining up to take this case. To top it off PennDOT, said I never should of been stopped. They claim the officer was incompetent in his procedures.
