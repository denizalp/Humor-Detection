The only thing that prevents me from giving one star is that they do have a very good blackened chicken caesar.  However, so does PT's up the street.\n\nGrand opening, and I have never been more ignored.  Background, I was a regional server trainer.  Even if it's a quick acknowledgement, you notice your guests.  Make eye contact and then move on while they are waiting for service?  You just told your customer to go elsewhere.\n\nWorse, I asked Erin about the buffet they had going on.  \"VIP's only, but I can get you a burger and a chicken skewer\".  Most gambling places, VIP status is based on play.  They just opened.  But I did see two children in the buffet line.  Far less than 21.  But no further info given.  Like, what qualifies as VIP.  Sales hit....   But no.  Just, only VIP, and you are not.\n\nI did get a burger, a skewer, and a bag of chips.  There was cheese on the burger, American.  No lettuce, tomato, or anything.  And I wasn't even given a napkin.  I had to grab some of the bar napkins from the server carisole.  \n\nErin was in the weeds.  And in my opinion, you were busy, but not that busy.  I saw two other men getting drinks, so two bartenders; not bar backs.  Add further insult, I asked one of them, twice, for something.  Another drink, and a refill of my diet pepsi.  Both ignored.
