You know what costs nothing?  To say to your customers, \"Hey.  How ya doin?  I'll be right with you\" or  \"Good morning\" or \"Thank you\".   Or...get this...flash them the occasional smile.  \n\nMr. M and I have been in here every couple of months for almost 5 years because we love their products and are willing to pay extra for them.  And they have a great beer and wine selection, and a good variety of wood for an afternoon BBQ.  And when I used to have a weekday off I could go in and there were usually a couple of older guys working who are so nice and I'd feel like I was truly in an old school butcher shop.  It was really a pleasure to shop there.\n\nBut the last couple of years there has been a huge turnover in employees.  Almost every time I go in there are different people working.  No smiles.  No greeting.  \n\nThe manager will either be talking on the phone taking care of business, or, like today, behind the counter stuffing peppers, not interacting with customers.  I remember one time I came in and she was working, finished a phone call, looked right at me, walked in the back, came back out and talked to an employee, and nobody said boo.  It's just annoying.  Especially when this store is a niche with high prices.  \n\nToday there were a couple of customers ordering items from the counter and my husband and I went in to get some seasoning and some brats out of the coolers.  We got what we needed and went to the register.  When one of the employees finished getting items for a customer from the counter, she walked over in front of us and rang him up.  Fine.  He and his fussy kid can get on down the road.  Then the next employee comes over and puts the stuff for his customer that he was helping, next to ours on the counter, and I'm thinking, \"What in the heck do I need to do to get rung up here?  Go order some jerky?\"  So we did.  I asked the guy behind the counter if customers ordering things from them take precedence from the self-serve people and he said, \"I just put that stuff on the counter.  If you're in line you're in line.\"  \n\nOK.  Well thank you, Captain Obvious.  I've been standing in line for awhile now.  \n\nAll the while the manager is standing there with her back to the store, stuffing peppers.  \n\nI probably sound a little petulant, and I'm at peace with that.  My beef is with the lack of friendly customer service.  I don't have to shop here and I'm really in no hurry to go back.  It's very disappointing.
