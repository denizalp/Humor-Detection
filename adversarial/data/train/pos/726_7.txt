pathetic. that's literally the only word that comes to mind.  we placed an order today through JustEat.ca, and i requested no avocado, because i am highly allergic.  the order arrives, and lo and behold my texmex chicken burrito is covered in avocado.  so we call you guys and let you know, and you tell us that there was no request for no avocado.  then later in the conversation you admit \"oh there it is...at  the bottom.\"  you then explain how you're going to have it sent back out.\n\nit's almost an hour after that phone call, and no burrito in site.  i call in, and am told \"well...we called a driver, but they haven't come to get it yet.\"  here's the crazy part.  our office is at bathurst & queen.  you are at king & bathurst.  how goddamn lazy are you?  WALK THE FUCKING ORDER UP THE STREET.  you could say that i could have also walked to the store, but we'd paid for our order to be delivered for our whole office staff.\n\nso here i am.  waiting on a burrito like a fucking moron.  actually....wait.  take your burrito, and shove it up your fucking ass.\n\nwhat an absolute load of horseshit.\n\nUPDATE: just received my burrito (a miracle?  act of god?) and this is what i imagine reheated dog shit tastes like.  suffice it to say, you will never get my money again.
