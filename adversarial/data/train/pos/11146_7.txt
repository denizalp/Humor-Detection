This used to be a store that sold office supplies...it was dirty and nothing was priced, and the service was sub-par. Hence, I am extremely glad that someone took over this building and did something with it. First of all, I do like the clever name, which I'm sure is derived from the film Miller's Crossing, and the fact that Miller is the owners' last name. (Good, solid English name...if I may say so myself.)\n\nI have been in here a few times and, for those who are unaware of how it works, people pay a monthly rate to rent a spot (or two) to house their wares and are paid according to what sells out of their spot. Each item is marked with the price and seller's \"room\" number, so there is no confusion. The owners may have spots of their own, but in general make their cash from renting the spots out. I have found a few nice things in here. Last time, I bought a cute bracelet for $2 and some books for $.50. Today, I almost bought a Kathy Van Zeeland purse for only $11 but then decided it was just a little too small for me.\n\nAnyway, the place is clean and very roomy, and has a public restroom. There is an eclectic mix of crafts, books, sport memorabilia, jewelry, furniture, antiques...just to name a few. For the most part, things seem reasonably priced. There are a few items that are a little on the expensive side, but frankly, it's all what someone is willing to pay. Plan to stop back in a month or so and see what's new!
