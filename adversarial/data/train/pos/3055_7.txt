I bought a car from this company 5 months ago. I went to do routine tire change at the certified local dodge dealer. I was approached by the service and manager. They explained to me that my car was a safety hazard and should not be driven. When I asked why the response was \"that the two front struts were installed backwards . This caused the strut bar to be pushed against the lower control arms on both sides of the car , creating an area on both arms that have a large amount of metal missing weakening these parts to the point of being dangerous. \"  This car dealership not only endangered my life but the lives of my family that ride in the car. When I contacted them they said \" this is not their problem and they would not take care of repairs. We are under different management.\" So basically this company sold me a dangerous car with safety issues. Do not by from speedy auto sales. They will scam you with offering you a free extra key fob to your car for a good review on here and send you a empty envelope with no fob and blame it on the postal service. Take your money elsewhere.
