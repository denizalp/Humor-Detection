So my husband and I come here all the time, because of the great customer service.  However, today was the exception.  We were in theatre 1 and sitting in the back row.  When we sat down, we had the heat pumping out right over top of us.  It was hot like a sauna.  When I went to customer service to ask them to turn the heat down some, I was told that was the way it is and the back rows are always hotter.  I am now physically ill from dehydration  because I've just spent the last two hours sweating.  Listening to your customers is one of the first rules of customer service.  Or so I thought.
