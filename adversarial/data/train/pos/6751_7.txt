It's been almost 4 years since I was here, so why am I just now writing this review? Because I still think about the chocolate from SoMA on a somewhat weekly basis. This is not so much a chocolate shop as it is a chocolate experience, providing a view into all that goes on behind the scenes.\n\nThis was my very first exposure to the magical delight that comes with the combination of salt and dark chocolate, so for that I am forever grateful. I can still recall the taste of that wonderful bite of chocolate today.\n\nA few years later while starting off my morning at 49th Parallel (http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz\/49th-parallel-coffee-vancouver#hrid:0s2ahXq4CiQP6WZpyiSAwg) in Vancouver I was fortunate enough to find a chocolate bar collaboration between that amazing coffee shop and SoMA. It's one of the best things I have ever eaten.\n\nIf your visit to Toronto allows it you simply must visit this place. Oh, and bring me some back, would yah?
