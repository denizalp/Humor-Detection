California representative here. Just thought I'd throw that disclaimer out there, since my critiques are based off the comparisons of The Boiling Crab and CrabHut. \n\nThis place is ok. The price is pretty much the same as its competitors. The taste... Far from it. We ordered the Trifecta #2 for our three lbs of shrimp (oh btw they don't do half lbs here). Hardly a trifecta of three flavors when all you taste is butter. The biggest difference is they don't use fresh garlic!! Their garlic seems like it came from the precut jars you get from Costco... in other words, it totally lacks flavor. Not to mention how unappetizing your meal gets as you notice the sauce start to harden on the placemat. Nothing like clogged arteries to make you feel good about your life decisions. \n\nThe only thing this place has going for them is the actual shrimp. They're large, they're not over cooked (*cough* CrabHut) and they're seemingly fresh. How you get fresh shrimp in Arizona... I'll never know. \n\nIf you ever get a chance, visit The Boiling Crab. The place has to put crack in their sauce because as soon as you leave, you crave it. Angry Crab didn't have that effect on me.
