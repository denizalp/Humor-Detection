The legendary Bloody Mary is reason enough to go to The Hash Kitchen (THK), but it turns out that they serve up some awesome breakfast dishes too.  They also have a wall of fame with all the athletes and celebrities who ate here as well.\n\nI rarely get Bloody Mary's, so I opted for the THK Bloody Mary instead of building my own.  The drink itself was spicy yet refreshing, and had a smoky flavor from bacon-infused vodka.  I enjoyed all the edible condiments: celery, bacon, pepperoni, pickles, and zucchini.  Perfect appetizers.\n\nThe sweet potato hash with lump crab meat came with two soft poached eggs and hollandaise sauce was outstanding.  My wife found it a bit rich but I like pairing egg with real crab meat. \n\nChicken and Waffles was another excellent dish, especially with fried leeks on top.  Waffles had bacon bits inside.  Chicken was breast only but had crispy breading and soft, juicy interior.  It rivals our previous favorite chicken and waffle at San Francisco's Bluestem Brasserie.\n\nSolid 5 stars.  Hash Kitchen makes breakfast great again.  Perfect meal to fuel up for a day of hiking!
