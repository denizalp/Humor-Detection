This place rocks my socks. \n\nPROS: Coffee, beer, wine, food. Vintage feel, shops the back, your choice of music on record player (yes VINYL). Service was great. Atmosphere is to my liking. Staff was friendly. \n\nCONS: (blank) \n\nAfter a night of doing research at the Bridal Spectacular inside Cashman Center, my husband found this place as he was waiting for me to complete my mini-adventure and I joined him right after. \n\nAs I walked up to the entrance, I hear a voice \"Can I please see your ID?\" I see a man, nice guy who calls himself 'Big D', asking me for my ID. I was really thrown off since my husband tells me this is a coffee shop, so if it is, why am I being carded??? Come to find out, they serve alcohol after 7pm. Alcohol?! SCORE! It was close to 9pm and my caffeine sensitive booty wasn't really looking forward to drink something that would keep me up all night, thank the Lord for creating this place. \n\nTheir menu is on the wall by the cashier and it's a pretty nice variety of stuff, not just coffee. Draft beer selection was limited but they had something similar to what I like, their equivalence of Sierra Nevada = Firestone. YUMMY. Got to come back to try the eats.\n\nIt's an awesome place if you're into threads, music and arts if the vintage kind. They have a record player hooked up to the sound system in the place. Anyone can pick and play whatever songs they want, just grab them off the shelf, put the record on the player, have a seat and enjoy! In the back they have different areas or rooms where they sell arts, records, clothing, books and stuffs. They were closed while I was there so I hope to return and check it out in the day time. \n\nRestrooms are clean. It's genius how they're put in the back so that you walk past the shops and displays. I was staring at everything, this was my candy shop.\n\nI loved the seating choice of husband that night. We took the corner window seats and it was quite an entertaining night especially when we saw two guys outside pushing carts with what looked like copper, more than likely stolen, lol. Man, interesting things that happen in downtown Las Vegas! \n\nIt's a great place to hang out, study, have a meeting or even a first date. \n\nI will absolutely, most definitely return.
