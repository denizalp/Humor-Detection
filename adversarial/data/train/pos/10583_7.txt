I'm reallllllllllllllllly disappointed with the service, or lack therefore. I recently recieved a bill for \"smoking counseling\" for $140...the \"smoking counseling\" was:\n\nDr. W: \"You need to quit.\" \nMe: \"I know.\"\nDr. W: \"I will make you start taking chantix.\"\nMe: \"I'm fine, I refuse to take chantix.\"\n\nThat was the conversation. So, I was billed $140 for a 1 minute \"conversation.\"\n\nWhen I called the billing department, she said the Doctor would lower the bill to $70. I still refuse to pay this, and I've let the billing department know this. They keep sending me a bill, and I continue to call, but do have not recieved a call back. This is a little ridiculous. Why would I pay this? My insurance covers all my visits. It's like they found a way to squeeze money out of me without having to bill my insurance company.\n\nWhat kind of crap is this? I'm NOT happy.
