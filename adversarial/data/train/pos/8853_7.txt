Yup, yelp is right. Pretty much a scaled down Cheesecake Factory, but a bit more sexy (if that's possible).\n\nThe menu wasn't as overwhelming as CF, but had just what we needed. Kiddo got the BBQ pork sliders.  It came with 3 and were really pretty good. Tangy sauce and cool cole slaw on top and perfectly priced at $6.50. \n\nDinner for me was the short rib grilled cheese sandwich. This too was satisfying, and the arugula was the perfect addition to the sandwich.\n\nService was great: efficient and quick, and I do believe I had 3 refills, none of which I actually had to ask for. That's how it should be done.\n\n+1 for the soundtrack during our stay. I heard Maxwell, India Arie, and John Legend for starters: my own personal playlist on repeat.
