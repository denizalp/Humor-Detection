I was really excited to come here for Botox because of the great reviews and I had received a flier in the mail that had $8 a unit for first time clients for Glo Medspa with Charles (he is not a doctor). The waiting room was cute. Once I sat down with Charles he never once asked me about how many units I get or told me how many he was going to put in me. It was my fault for assuming that he would put how many I normally get which is between 18-22 units which is the amount I've always gotten from several different places since I don't have many wrinkles at all. I didn't really feel confident that he knew what he was doing. As soon as he was done he led me to the front desk to get me checked out. $245 was the amount they asked for. I was not expecting to pay that much since it was only $8 a unit. So I asked Charles how many units he put in me and he said \"Uhm 35, it will last longer because I put more in.\" It doesn't matter how much Botox you put in, it'll always last no more than 3 months. I have never gotten that many units because I don't need that many and was shocked. Sounds like he just put way more units in (or said he did) to make more money. I normally pay $11 a unit and never have I paid more than $200. Why even come here? I felt ripped off & Hopefully my forehead won't sag in a week.
