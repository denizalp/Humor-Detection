Got takeout early on a Friday evening,  The lady got hummus, (her opium), and stuffed grape leaves. She was not a fan of either.  She hadn't eaten all day, and a few bites of each was more than sufficient to sate her appetite.  I got the sampler platter which included a stuffed grape leaf, a phylo triamgle stuffed with spiced spinach, a cheese stuffed phylo triangle, some gyro meat, tzatsiki sauce a few pita wedges and a small side salad.  It sounds like more than it was, as the triangles and grape leaf were all smallish.  Nothing was all that wonderful.  There were insufficient sauce and pita wedges for the gyro meat.  I'm a fan of independent restaraunts, but I doubt I'll return.\nAladin's is the same distance from our house and beats them hands down.
