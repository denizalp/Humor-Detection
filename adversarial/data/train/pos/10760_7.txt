Not sure why this park gets no love. Someone from my playgroup said you can come across \"unsavory\" people. Yes, this park is not near $500K homes, their is a large apartment complex across the street and the park goers are diverse, but I'm probably as shady as it gets, so yeah you should probably stay away.  I'm still getting used to the fact random individuals can carry a gun in Phoenix, but I don't know you well enough to start talking politics.  Back to the park...\n\nPut this park in Los Angeles and you would have 100 kids running around. This park is huge.  The play structure is huge and fairly new.  The structure is on sand.  They have bathrooms and surprisingly they are not that dirty for a public park.  There are sand volleyball courts and lots of grass for dogs and\/or children to run.  On the weekends I've seen birthday parties and people playing sand volleyball etc., but during the weekday this place has hardly anyone around.  \n\nSome people mention disc golf is played here, but I am fairly lame and have no idea what disc golf even is.  Supposedly there is a six station fitness course too, but yeah I'm not into that.  I get enough exercise running after the rugrats.  \n\nThere's a Starbucks drive thru on the corner of Indian School and 28th, so make sure to grab some caffeine.\n\nWe usually go to Kachina Park because it is closer and usually more kids are there, but I come here for some variety.
