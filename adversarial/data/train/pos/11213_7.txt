We were at the Airport in Las Vegas on a bit of a delay. So we went to sit down and eat at Chili's.\nThe hostess was nice,she sat us at a small table in the bar, stating this was all that was left as they were full up.\nSorry to say our Server hated her job!   That is sad ,because,it is not a bad place at all.  \nThe food was really good. I got soup and egg rolls,excellent and my boyfriend got a Burger and fries. We had to ask for refills on our drinks, but the worst was I had to ask for napkins and Silver ware. That is just not cool in my book. She was storming around the whole time,mad at everyone she worked with as well. \nEveryone else there seemed pretty happy to be there. So that is why I only took one star down. A bit high priced ,but it is the Airport. Both of our foods were fab though. I would go back, just hopefully with another server.
