I will never go anywhere else for FroYo! They have a huge selection of tart flavors and their toppings are fresh and plentiful. There are always new flavors and the place is impeccably clean. To top it all off, they're cheaper than the competitors. I wish there was a Yogurtland on every block... however, I would then inevitably weigh 20 pounds more.
