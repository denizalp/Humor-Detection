Now, while I enjoy OG's food - Soup, Salad, and Breadsticks galore!!  The service here the night I came her with my husband's family, was terrible!!  Did not get drink refills.  The server brought another bowl of soup, a few minutes after he had brought my dinner.  I'm in the middle of feeding Baby C and am like...Yeah...I'm no where near needing another bowl as I havent even started the one in front of me.  And I had to ask as to where my salad was and then a salad plate when he brought the salad finally out.  \n\nI unfortunately had to leave more of a tip than I wanted to, cause it was already added to my bill - there were 15 of us in our party.
