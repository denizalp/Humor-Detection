My boyfriend and I came when there was a crowded lobby. We didn't expect to stay, we just came in to check the wait time in case they were finishing up a couple people. The technician said \"we'll take it back right now\" as if our wait wouldn't be that long. Fast forward about 45 minutes, we just saw our cars being taken back. I'm not sure what his definition of \"right now,\" is but I definitely didn't define it as 40 minutes later.\n\nThe lobby is small. If you see 4 people waiting you're better off coming back another time. There's super limited seating. There was a guy that came in after us, but his car was taken before us. I also heard him coming in for an oil change like us. I think he takes his car there regularly because they seemed to know him as \"hey you brought the prius?\" And he very specifically stated that he didn't have an appointment. I get knowing people but don't put other people in front when your lobby is full and everyone can hear and notice what you did. I'll probably go somewhere else next time I need an oil change. Atleast somewhere I can sit without feeling claustrophobic.
