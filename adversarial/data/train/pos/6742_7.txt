A. Got a free limo ride to the spot, don't know how since I was blitzzed\nB. Rhino\/OG\/Cheetahs seem to be exactly the same from the inside...dark, smoky, stipper-perfume clogs your nostrils, $10 beers, $125 lap diggities, same ol same ol\nC. I know its trite to hit up strip joints in vegas but leaving vegas and not hitting one is just plain wrong (even if you aren't a frequenter of gentleman's clubs)\nD. The 2 girls I \"donated\" $ to, were very chatty and seemed not to want to pick my pocket, but then again, I was toast\n\nI will hit again (when in Rome..blahblahblah)
