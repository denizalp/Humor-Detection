My first experience of this Center was during the graduation for a small private college in which I was teaching a few years ago, and I was impressed by the bold exterior design which seemed to reflect the mountains to the south. The theater inside was just as impressive - not a very capacious venue but with a pleasing modern design and spacious enough for a moderate-size audience. As part of the faculty during the graduation ceremony, I was able to use one of the dressing rooms for performing artists as well as see the areas behind the stage and I can say that indeed the theater was designed not just with the audience but also with the stage performers and crew in mind. Other areas within the Center include a studio, an art gallery, and spacious lobby\/lounge areas. There is also a sculpture garden just outside the arts gallery. Recently I attended an arts workshop, listened to a discussion by artists who had a presentation that day at the studio, and relaxed at the Friday happy hour at the lounge and patio afterward. On various occasions, I have just wandered around the grounds to enjoy the scenery and the refreshing breezes at the promenade area between the Center and the Tempe Town Lake. This is truly a beautiful, fully utilized multi-function venue and a thoughtful gem offered to the public by the city of Tempe.
