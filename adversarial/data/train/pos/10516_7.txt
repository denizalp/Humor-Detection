Man I hate this store with all that I have. \n\nWide isles huh, yeah sure. You can not get up and down an isle to save your soul. \n\nI hate the other shoppers, they come in and act as if they are in a museum looking over things that have never seen the light of day. Good God pick it up put it in your cart and move on. \n\nThe product; a bunch of stuff no one should ever eat. It is just all too silly. \n\nChecking out, oh what an ordeal. It makes no difference if only one person is in front of you; it is going to take much too long with the chit chat between the cashier and customer. The lack of coordination in getting the food out of the cart and in to the personal canvas bags is astounding. wait for the fool to run back and pick something else up at the end of the transaction then you wait for them to get their card out to process a payment. \n\nIf I am ever again forced to venture in to one of these stores I am going to throw a hissy fit and wait in the car. \n\nMan I hate this store.
