I've bought a variety of things here including strollers, car seats and a high chair. They have knowledgeable staff however most of their staff is stuck up and have a poor attitude. The main advantage to this store was that they usually have lots of quantity of the products that they sell.\n\nMy most recent experience will cause me to no longer patronize the store. We purchased two baby cups a few months ago. In one the straw developed mould and the other one started to leak. I would have expected them to exchange it (I even had the receipt) but they told me to go away and deal with the manufacturer directly. When you decide to charge a 20% premium on everything I expect better customer service. Even Wal-Mart or Sears will take a malfunctioning product back and deal with the manufacturer.
