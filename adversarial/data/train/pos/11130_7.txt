I really don't need to write this review because I agree with the other reviews 100%. But I will. \n\nThe food was pretty much disgusting. \nThe service was awful. \nThe smell? Awful! It smelled like a ashtray mated with a urinal cake and had a restaurant named Delsangros. \nTake heed - I don't hand out many one star reviews.
