I am in town on business. My hair care products were thrown out of my carry-on. I was able to get a quick appointment at a reasonable price. They were quick and ran on time. They had a lot of stylists. Patrus was mine and he was interesting, talented and quick. \n\nI will save his card in case I ever get in this situation again.
