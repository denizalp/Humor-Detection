This salon is absolutely fabulous!!! I have no problem driving 30 minutes to get there to get the best service & most comfortable setting ~ tea\/espresso, cookies, and a fun staff are all added bonuses to my amazing stylist Enjoly. Dubbed an \"experience\" Enjoly creates a peaceful setting full of mind shifting conversation and beautiful imagery for the soul..and then she does your hair an you know you've met an artist.\nAJ, owner and kind boss to his staff, is always there with a smile immediately offering a drink to start the \"experience\" off. Yay foe Hypnotic!!!
