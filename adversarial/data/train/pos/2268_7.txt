This place, argh! We went here about a year ago and were promptly sat. Everything good so far, right? Wrong! The waitress (with an emphasis on the word 'wait'), never showed up after 15 minutes. We got up to leave and the manager stopped us and offered anything on the menu for our troubles. \n\nWe stayed, and the manager left a nice taste in our mouths. I wish I could say the same about the food...\n\nFast forward to today. We figured we'd give this place another try because the manager had been so good to us the last time. We showed up and the hostess took us to our seats and I saw the head of the waitress from last time bobbing around the expo line. I said to my dining companion, \"Christ, I guarantee she is our waitress again.\" \n\nAfter a few minutes she made her way over and said she'd be right with us. My dining partner and I looked at each other with dread in our eyes. Here we go again!\n\nThe waitress is the older gal with the black hair... I want to say she has glasses, but I could be wrong. In my mind her name sounds vaguely ethnic (not that that is an issue, I'm telling you this because should you not heed my warnings and actually come here and are sat in the section of someone who fits this description, RUN!!!!)\n\nShe didn't take as long to come back around and take our drink and food orders, which was good. The food showed up and it was kinda gross. The rice tasted over-cooked and the meat was without \"sabor autent√≠co.\"  We never received a drink refill without asking and waiting for it (she's getting better!). \n\nWhen it was time for the bill, our waitress disappeared. Why is it that this is the problem with many restaurants in Vegas?! Everything goes kinda well, then the server never brings the check?! I don't get it... We waited a good 10 minutes for the check and by the time everything was finished and the dust was settled, we vowed to never return. \n\nI will keep this solemn vow until I die, I promise that!
