My one regret from living in San Diego is that I didn't go to the original Tacos El Gordo in Chula Vista more than once in the three and a half years that I lived there.  Seriously, what I did was practically a crime against humanity.  Because as I mentioned in that review, you're not going to get better tacos anywhere other than Mexico itself.  So when I realized the Gordo opened in Vegas...of course I didn't bother going here either until now LOL.  Yeah, I should just quit on life.\n\nSame deal as the original.  Different meats at different stations, line up and go get some.  If you come here and don't get the adobada, you might as well just get back in your car and drive away.  This adobada is easily some of the best in the world and is the #1 reason to even come here.  Carne asada was just ok in my book, but at least it was prepared with the proper ingredients (aka HELLA GUACAMOLE), so it gets a passing grade in my book.\n\nAnd since I figured I needed to make up for not coming here who knows how many times, I came for the tacos before going to XS and came for the super fries after going to XS.  Because quite frankly, nothing beats drunk food like drunk Mexican food.  And nothing beats drunk Mexican food like super fries topped with carne asada, adobada, cheese, and guacamole!\n\nI think I have an excuse to go to XS a lot more now.  When the joint is across the street from Encore Las Vegas, there's really not much choice.  Secret Pizza, you have met your post-clubbing food match!
