I hate going here.  I do not know why my parents insist on coming here every year especially when it is not a memorable experience. \n\nPerhaps you will have a different experience if you like\n-crowds of people on weekends for the ferry\n-waiting 30 mins to purchase tickets for a ferry\n-waiting 1hr for a ferry ride\n\nso many better places to spend your free time.  i would rather go to cherry beach
