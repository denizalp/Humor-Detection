-\"Hey honey, I went to the asian market today\"\n-\"YUE-WAH?!?!\"\n\nThe only good thing about living in this neighborhood is my proximity to Yue Wah. I love this place. The prices are so low and each aisle is separated into different ethnicities (e.g. hispanic, middle eastern, filipino, thai, indian, korean, etc...). I've found that this system either makes it really difficult or really easy to find what you're looking for. For instance, if I need kimchi, I know exactly where to find it. But if I need tamarind paste or fish sauce, I have no idea where to look because these things could come from one of many asian cuisines.\n\nYue Wah has a pretty decent produce section too. Sometimes they run out of things, and some produce items seem a bit old. The garlic almost always has green sprouts growing out of it, so I try to avoid those types of items. But I love coming here for bok choy, plantains, and thai basil. I also love their selection of drinks. If I'm ever craving something cold, they have bottles of jarritos and a cans of guava juice for like $0.69! Compare that to the $1.79 high fructose corn syrup coca-cola you buy at the gas station. I have yet to explore Yue Wah's frozen food selection, but it seems like they have a wide variety of fishes to choose from, as well as easy stuff like frozen samosas.... yum!\n\nMy least favorite thing about Yue Wah is the mean old lady that \"greets\" you with a grim stare as you come in. She is NEVER friendly and I'm not even sure she speaks english... not that there's anything wrong with that, but at least smile. Her husband (at least I think he's her husband) is much more friendly and will show you where anything is and answer any questions.\n\nIn response to one of the reviews below, they DO carry oriental dishes\/cups\/teapots\/platters\/etc. Even little soaps and chopsticks ^_^\n\nALSO BEWARE, they have a $10 credit card minimum so come with cash if your purchase is small.
