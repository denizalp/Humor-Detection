I was here a few months ago, and only one floor was open. There's a K-Mart, a supermarket, a comic book emporium, and that's about it. The comics shop, Phantom of the Attic, is still in business and was pretty much my only reason for ever coming here. Shopping at POTA was a monthly ritual for me during my teen years. I'm glad they're still open and hope they find a new home if PCM closes up for good. \n\nThere was also the National Record Mart (a chain) for buying music, complete with an Adam Curry lookalike for a cashier, an arcade that also had bumper cars (!), a t-shirt shop I bought all of my heavy metal tees for high school from, and the Potato Patch restaurant in the food court that sold the best loaded baked potatoes I've ever eaten. \n\nZayre's, possibly the most abysmal department store ever run, had a location at PCM. They did no recovery, so there were empty boxes and open packages all over the place.\n\nAnd there was a Chi Chi's!
