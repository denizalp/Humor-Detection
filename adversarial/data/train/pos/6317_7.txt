Met my friend here for lunch on the day it snowed in Phoenix. At this time though, it was only rain. It snowed after lunch.\n I have to say this was a wonderful experience. Not like the one I had at Sky Harbor.\nIt was packed when I arrived,a 20 min wait. No problem, nice place and lots to look at here. Parking lot was jammed ,but I was blessed enough to find a spot. My friend Valeted,which was also nice as it was free.\n The fire place was going full steam, lovely since it was rainy and cold outdoors.\nOur server was Cara, and she was lovely. She kept our drinks filled and was very attentive even though, she was very busy with a full house.\nI ordered soup and the Brussel sprout salad, I have to say it is the best salad ever.\nThey had run out of soup of the day,and were substituting french onion.\nI love French Onion, but this had no flavor. Cara got me something else right away. She was so awesome.\nMy friend got the French Dip, she said it is now one of her favorites. At $15.00 she said, well worth it. \nIt was a lovely day and a lovely place. I am excited to go back.\n I may try the airport one again, I hope it can compare. My last time there was less than fun.\nAny way, if you are looking for a lovely afternoon somewhere, this is the place. \nThe staff is warm and friendly.  They seem very genuine and the place is beautiful. \nBathrooms are nice and clean and very modern.
