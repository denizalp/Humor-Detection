If you like having the reservations you made 2 weeks in advance, that were confirmed in person, by you 2 hours prior, then confirmed 20 minutes prior to your arrival by the hotel concierge, completely disregarded and ignored. \nIf you like that after waiting 15 minutes for a table you are seated in a 3\/4 empty dining room of un-bussed tables. \nAnd if you like a waiter coming over to your table right after you sit down, telling him your not ready to order and then never seeing him again. \nThen RUN, don't walk to Tableau. This is your place because it sure isn't mine. \nPS we left, so I don't know if he ever came back to the table. \nSecond disappointing dining experience here at the Wynn and we arrived last night.
