Lets just run down what happened at the Hard Rock Hotel Tower in Las Vegas.\n\nCheck in is supposed to be between 3 and 4 in the afternoon.  We arrived at 4:20pm and I was told my room was still not ready.  They told me it should be \"inspected\" in the next 30 to 40 minutes.  I was then supposed to sit in the lobby with my wife and wait.  Not the way to start a trip.  There should be no reason why all the reservations can't be ready by the 4pm check in time.\n\nOur room was very nice with one feature that was really cool.  Music piped into the room with a pretty cool selection.  Dimmers were not available on any of the lights.  They are either on full blast or off.  Not a good design.  Also no free Internet which I think in a suite this should be standard.\n\nWe went out to dinner had a nice time in Vegas and returned to the room around 1am.  Hard Rock has a new club called Vanity that was pounding music 4 floors bellow us.  It was so disturbingly loud in the room we thought, \"this can not be happening.\"  I called the front desk and was told the music would stop by 4am.  WHAT!!!.  I was also told they could not move me as they were at capacity.  By 3am I was so over the noise I would have paid a premium to be anywhere else.  We couldn't find a room and I didn't want to loose what we had already committed by signing the room contract at HRH.\n\nI called the desk again at 3am.  The woman told me they would move us first thing in the morning and she was sorry,  and to come down early to get it handled.  Now its Sunday morning and Rehab pool is about to  begin its music soon (we had a pool view room), so I got up early and tried to have the situation fixed.  I asked for a manager at 9am.  The woman told me she could help (not wanting to get a manager) and would see what she might be able to do.  She apologized and said she could move us but not until 11 or 12!!  I was not happy.  She then offers $50 dollars off for \"breakfast\".  This is insulting but I take the $50 and say Ill be back by 12 noon.  \n\nWe go to lunch.  Hang out wait half the day and come back to the HRH Tower at 3pm.  I ask for the keys for our new room.  A new front desk employee (with a horrible attitude) tells me the room is still not \"inspected\" and it will be another 30 to 40 minutes, I've heard that before.  Now I am ballistic.  I ask for a manager right away.  The GM will not come out right away.  He's busy and she says \"he will be out in about 20 minutes.\"\n\nIn the mean time the original girl comes walking back from her break (the one I spoke to at 9am). I explain to her what is happening and she goes behind the counter, looks in the computer and says \"your room is ready.\"  We move and a GM never comes out to talk to me face to face.  I'm\"m told he or she will call me.  I get to he new room and the GM has left a message on my new room phone.  A great way not to have to talk to me.  I call her back and am told she is busy but will call in a few minutes.  She never calls.  \n\nThe next morning I ask about talking to someone, like the GM who called me last night and left a message.  I'm told she is now on military leave and is not available.\n\nLong story short we fly home and at 11pm Monday night I get someone on the line and tell them my story.  He gives me $150 off and sends the confirmation in an email that say's \"do not respond to this email.\"  I promise I wont respond ever.\n\nMorgan's Hotel group you now have the two worst hotel experiences I have ever had HRH Tower in Vegas and the Hudson Hotel in NYC. \n\nI promise to never stay at any of your facilities again.  Get some better costumer service or get out of the hospitality business. You guys are the worst, the absolute worst.
