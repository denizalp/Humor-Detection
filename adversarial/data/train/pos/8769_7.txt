Tryst in 2011 is like that girl you used to date who was a model...15 years ago.\n\nYou can get a lot of mileage out of Tryst because it's no longer one of the 'it' spots in Vegas, but the place is still real nice by most common standards. \n\nYou won't have to deal with a ridiculous line, pretentious doormen\/bouncers, and people all up in your grill because the venue broke fire-code 500 patrons ago.\n\n5 stars because I'm feeling generous.
