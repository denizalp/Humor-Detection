Victoria's work is remarkable! Her creativity, keen eye, experience and resources make her a one-of-kind designer. Her dedication to each client she works with makes your experience working with her a true joy. She takes great pride in getting to know each client and  she listens intently to what their dream home looks like and transforms it into a reality.  Victoria also has great contacts for high end cabinetry, drapery and electrical interior work.  Her access to extraordinary furnishings is remarkable. Her caring and honest character give you the security you need when investing money in the home of your dreams! I highly recommend this company. My home is not only gorgeous but it reflects my personality and exceeded my expectation in every way. \nCathy Backus
