I find that much of the food tastes the same; not exactly the same, but the same in that 'massive chain' sort of way.  But, it's still a good option for early morning or late night food.\n\nI like the one in Palazzo better.  This one is open 24 hours a day, which is important, but it's sooo huge and sooo busy that the service kinda sucks.
