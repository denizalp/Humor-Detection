I am smart! I am so smart! I came to Guu Izakaya on a Monday night at 9 PM! There is no wait! We got seated right away at the bar.\n\nThis place is busy! This place is buzzing! This place is full of energy! I really enjoy the concept!  I like all the yelling and humming with languages I don't understand!\n\nWe ordered 4 dishes to share between 2 of us: deep fried octopus balls, deep fried chicken, grilled squid and cheese bibimbap. They are all tasty except for the deep fried chicken. The chicken was really oily and gross because they double fried them! I could only eat 1 piece...\n\nThe Sake Mojitos is really neat! I enjoy that (of course popping the GUU Original RAMUNE is so much fun!).. the other cocktails looks really interesting too!\n\nWe finish our meal off with a Wasabi Cheesecake. It is not too sweet and just have a hint of wasabi taste.. yummm.. the only complain it is too small.. not good to share with your friend!\n\nI really enjoy seating at the bar watching the cooking, though afterwards I do smell like fried chicken!\n\nSince there was no one else waiting for a table, no 2 hour seating limit was enforced.\n\nYes I will be back and enjoy more drinks and bar food with my friends! But definitely on a weekday. I would not have wait in line for 1 hour or 2 for this experience!
