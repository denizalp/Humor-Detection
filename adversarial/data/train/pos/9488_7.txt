Overpriced? Yes.\nDelicious? Well.. It depends.\n\nI come here always wanting to sit down, but the wait time is always terribly long. Considered making reservations but its awfully hard to keep track of time in Vegas. But on the occasions that I do drop by, I've purchased things from the take-out window. Line takes 20 minutes more or less, pray to the desert gods that you're in the shade if it's the summer. I absolutely loved their double frozen hot chocolate, I loved it the first, second, and third time. The flavor and refreshing chills never disappoints. I decided to spice it up and get the green tea frozen hot chocolate, because, you know, we asian and we like our green tea. Boy was I wrong, it was like drinking a watered-down, non-fat, anorexic-slim milk, with matcha powder. It was literally a diet milk. I mean, I still drank it, I'm not going to throw an $11 beverage away. Let me repeat that - $11 for diet milk.
