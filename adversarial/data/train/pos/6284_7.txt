I read the reviews on here, so I called and got great, fast, friendly service. They showed up and charged me 156.31 (wait for this)...to replace a fill valve&flapper. Oh, this was after a \"thirty dollar coupon\" because I said, \"What?!\" After I asked how much I'd be writing the check for, and he answered with ,\"$186.31\". I get getting what you pay for, but this was a complete rip off. Beware.
