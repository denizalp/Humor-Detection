The Aria Lobby Bar is open until 2 AM and has comfortable seating.  The complementary dill pickle popcorn & spicy ranch popcorn are wonderful. \n\nThe lobby bar has a signature cocktail menu and the prices are not bad.  The Basil Grapefruit Martini and Cucumber Martinis are both delicious, however I am partial to the cucumber because it doesn't have any sugar in it and it's not sweet; the basil grapefruit is pretty sweet.\n\nOverall, it's a good place to post up if you're winding down or waiting to turn up!
