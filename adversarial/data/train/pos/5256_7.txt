I had high expectations going into this place due to the name, and the fact that they already have a successful location here in the valley, but was let down.\n\nWent in to order my Philly, and was greeted by who might possibly be the least intelligent ASU coed in existence (Yes, I found her).  The experience went like this:\n\nMe: : Hello, I want to get a regular Philly to go.  Could I get some extra onions on that please?  (Mind you, it already comes with onions and cheese)   I see you have potato salad.  Is it homemade?\"\n\nShe: (Vapid stare into the void)\n\nMe:  (After uncomfortable silence of seemingly years)  \"Uuh...is your potato salad made here...like in-house?\"\n\nShe:  \"Well, uuh, it's better than the stuff you get at the grocery store.\"\n\nMe:  \"I, um...well, you see... OK, never mind  (giving up).  I'll try it.\n\nShe:  \"That'll be 13.00 (and change)\".\n\nMe:  (Looking at the bill)  \"Ummmm....you guys charge 50 cents (OK, 49) for extra onions?  Does that seem a little strange???\"\n\nShe:  (Vapid stare returns)\n\nMe: \"Fine, whatever...but that's really cheap, you might want to tell the owner that 50 cents for some extra onions on a sandwich that already comes with them is a bit of overkill.\n\nShe:  *crickets chirping*\n\nThe sandwich was OK, probably three stars, and the potato salad was fine.  Likely it is from Shamrock or whoever their distributor is.  There seems to be no way to find out.  This is the first one star review I have written.  I hope the owner reads this and realizes how effing cheap it is to charge fifty cents to throw some extra onions on an effing sandwich. Cheese sauce is their own recipe it seems, not WIZ like someone already mentioned.  It is OK.\n\nAlso, train your staff.  You have been there for months now.  Have all cashiers spend a few hours in the kitchen to see wtf is going on with your product.\n\nOne more comment, before I end this rant.  13+ dollars for a sandwich and a small potato salad is bloody ridiculous.  This place is now officially on the boycott list.
