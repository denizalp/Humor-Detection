Sashimi Salad: OVERPRICED & UNDERWHELMING!!!  I love Sashimi salads and have enjoyed many good ones in many sushi different restaurants. Since I am in town from So. Cal on business and wanted to grab a quick, healthy and light lunch between appointments I decided to Yelp Japanese restaurants in my vicinity. I was delighted to see Hanabi was close by and had a 4.5* rating by 150+ people. When I arrived at the restaurant at 12:30 pm, the peak of lunch hour, on a Wednesday I thought it was odd that a restaurant so highly rated was nearly empty except for one other table. \n After I ordered and my sashimi salad arrived I understood why the place was so empty. \nMost sashimi salads I've had are made with healthy rich greens and other vegetables and a pretty decent amount of sashimi  making for a colorful, healthy and satisfying meal. The size of these salads are usually served in plates about 8-10\" in diameter. The sashimi salad at Hanabi was made up of a small amount of ice berg lettuce, one strand of pickled carrot, a small clump of white shredded radish with about 6 small pieces of sashimi served on a small rectangular plate approx 4\"x6\". The cost of this sad salad was $15, the same as what I have paid in other restaurants where I got a lot more. After my experience at Hanabi I find their ratings and review very suspect. I know it was just one item on their menu but the fact that no other customer came in by the time I left really makes me question the reviews. Sorry no offense to those who have submitted good reviews. Glad you had a good experience but I definitely was disappointed, left hungry and very dissatisfied.
