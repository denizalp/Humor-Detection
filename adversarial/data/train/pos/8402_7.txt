WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE OF ALL TIME!!!!!!!\n\nTWICE! TWICE, I have tried to get chicken here..  Twice, I left without any.. One time I ordered a simple 4piece meal.. Waited over 20 minutes in the friggin' gas station, and when I asked for an ETA, they said it would be at least another 15 minutes! I Demanded a refund, and left without anything. \n\n\nToday,I tried to stop in and get the same 4-piece meal..  There was NO ONE in line in front of me.. The girl at the counter seem extremely UN-interested in taking my order and let me know it was be at least 25 minutes before my meal would be ready.   \n\nThis place seriously has the worst customer service I've ever seen.  I would highly recommend staying away, and don't even attempt to get any chicken here.
