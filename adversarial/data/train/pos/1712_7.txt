Came here for a friend's birthday. They take reservations and was able to accommodate a party of ten. \n\nAtmosphere:  5 stars!  Loved the decor and look of the place. The bar was really pretty. Lots of accents of gold and marble. \n\nService:  4 stars. The waiters were nice and gave us his recommendations but he forgot an order and it came out later than everyone else's. However he did give us a complimentary salmon tartine dish so that was nice. \n\nFood:  2 stars. Sadly... On our side of the table, none of us really liked our food. I mean it was good but it didn't blow us away. And for this price point I was really disappointed. I mean 15 dollars for soup... Had to be good right?  Nope... Didn't really enjoy it.  Between all of us we ordered basically 75% of the menu. We got all the appetizers, salads. Fish, pork chop, steak, mussels and gnocchi. Nothing was spectacular... Just ok.b I would say maybe the sea bass and the crab crepe were the best ones out of the bunch. Did not like the pate, bone marrow, froie grois, or pork chop. \n\nI would come here for drinks next time because it really is a cute place. Then I would go somewhere else for food.
