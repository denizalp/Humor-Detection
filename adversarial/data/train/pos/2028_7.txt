I am stubborn and NEVER get manicures because I am convinced that I do just as good of a job as they do on my own nails.. But I decided to go in and have my nails done because they were so wrecked.. chipped and jagged in all different directions. They were so bad that I just wanted to get them done ASAP, so I didn't really search a place.. I just drove down Decatur & went to the first nail salon I found... this place happened to be it. I just wanted a basic manicure.. The moment I walked in and saw the selection of colors was when I hesitated and SHOULD HAVE walked out. I had never seen the brands before! No OPI or Essie... call me a princess, but I thought OPI was a given?? If they did have those brands.. the selection was VERY limited.\n\nThe woman was friendly and did a good job painting my nails, but bubbles formed less than 10 minutes after leaving the salon.. Nail herpes? I received a lot of compliments but overall I was unhappy with the quality. From far away, my nails looked fine.. But since I am OCD about my nails and look at them 349085x a day, the bubbles irritated the $h!t outta me! The nail polish brand was probably cheap or old.. Or something.... But they should probably invest in higher quality stuff! In the end, I came to the conclusion that I can paint my nails just as good.. Without the bonus nail herpes.
