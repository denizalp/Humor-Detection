Went for dinner an wasn't greeted at the door. No big deal, let's head over to the bar to look at the winelist... and wait, and wait. Ok let's pretend I don't exist, and I'm freaking starving, I just can't believe the bartender tells me that I can order dinner at the bar. No butthead, I'd like a table and be served, sorry no tip for you. Doubt I'll be back. 9:00pm and heading for a old standby for some comfort food.
