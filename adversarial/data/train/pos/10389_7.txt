The hotel did not inform us they were a month behind on their construction schedule, and the concierge put us in a room right below and next to an active construction zone. The desk then made excuses that all the rooms are equally loud - which is definitely just a lie, we're directly below and adjacent to active construction. Ridiculous, that they don't have blocks of rooms blocked off because of their position relative to construction zones. Extremely disappointed, MGM is usually up-front about this stuff (I shouldn't be informed by a piece of paper when I get into the room, the MGM group has the time and money to inform guests in a better way). Seriously upset and disappointed.
