This place is only ok because they have fewer menu options than the Eglinton location. \n\nBut don't get me wrong they still have a ton of menu choices, just not as many as the other location!! And I love the food. yum! And it's decently priced, yay!\n\nThe only minus (and this goes for all Loving Hut locations) is the weird vegan\/religion cult stuff that plays on a big tv non-stop. (???) why! Yes I'll have my soup with a side of wacko propaganda please. Exactly, just weird.\n\nStaff are friendly and for the most part are not members of the wacko cult. Check it out!
