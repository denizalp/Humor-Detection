I braved the reviews and decided to try this place out anyway. \n\nSorry to anyone that has Ill feelings but unfortunately we do not know the truth and can only comment on the current, as we see it. \n\nIt took me two u-turns to actually find the place but that is because I did not look at the address before I left. It is located on the North East side behind the Oil changing place. \n\nThe building was bigger then I had expected and I liked the colors of the exterior. \n\nI walked in stuck me head in the bar and the waiting room and no one was there to greet me. It took about 2 full min which feels like forever for some reason. The owner (I assume) seated me in the bar while I waited for Ryan C. \n\nThe interior was clean and inviting. I liked the bar setup. \n\nThe bar tender\/waitress helped me with a cold drink while I waited. I usually wait for Ryan for just about everything. LOL \n\nI looked over the menu and the the lunch specials are killer. $4 for a 1\/4lb pork sandwich with a side. WOW \n\nWe both had pork sandwiches one with fries and one with salad. The meat was good, we each had one hunk o fat but the texture and flavor (before sauce) was good. The meat was a little too greasy and soaked the bottom bun while dripping out as well. The spicy sauce was good but not too spicy. The blue cheese was lacking. \n\nAll in all I had a great lunch. I would go back and use my REST.com coupon for dinner.
