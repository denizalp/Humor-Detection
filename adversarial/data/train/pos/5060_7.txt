This spot is located near my work, and I've occasionally dropped in for takeout. The pho, as many other reviews state, is extremely unremarkable. Surprisingly, the lunch specials and chinese dishes seem to be where this place does best.\n\nLunch specials are $6 for a main, rice, and a cheese wonton- the beef and broccoli was surprisingly good, with tons of FRESH broccoli instead of the usual flavorless, frozen kind. The spring rolls are okay, always fresh and decently filled. \n\nThe vermicelli\/bun dishes are just okay: meats are bland, minimal veggies used. When grabbing to go, this is crammed into a takeout box that makes it difficult to mix. Would like to see them put these in a plastic container with a lid, like a salad, instead. Overall, pretty average.
