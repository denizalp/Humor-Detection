Stellar parm fries. \n\nGood wine. \n\nNice calamari.\n\nThis place was pleasantly not packed on First Friday, so my friend and I were able to get right in and order something to nosh on before entering the Roosevelt Row mayhem. I'm looking forward to returning for a proper meal, and not just their apps.
