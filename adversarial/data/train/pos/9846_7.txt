(I will update this later if I ever get a chance to eat here)\nWe stopped in here on a whim during the tree lighting in Crocker. I know this can be a crazy time for Crocker and all the restaurants are packed so we expected to wait a little for a table. We walk in and there's a chalk sign that says seat yourself. Well there's no tables except a large 6 (maybe 8) top towards the back. There was a women and her daughter who came in when we did who offered to share the table with us since they were so busy. No problem right? Well after we are seated and settled a server comes over to us and states the table is reserved. There aren't any signs on the table to say this but that's fine we can wait. The lady who was with her daughter asked the server where can we wait for a table then and the server says \"oh, I don't know. I don't think you can\"....sooooo what do you do then but pack up and leave? \n\nThanks Bar Louie for literally the worst experience yet at a restaurant since apparently we aren't even allowed to wait for a table. (Maybe next time I won't bring my children but bring more adults that will have a larger bar tab and then maybe you'll offer to let us wait for a table)
