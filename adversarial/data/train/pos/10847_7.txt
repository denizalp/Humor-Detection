I will never go back. The smell when you walk in, is not of Indian food. It smells like a sewer backed up. Funny, I was visiting a friend who lives in the building that it's attached to, and I noticed a horrible stench in the lobby. It went on for 2 weeks. Upon investigating, it was The Spice Village. They had a kitchen flood that they were rather remiss on fixing. Many complaints were made and they took no urgency over the situation. The smell was horrid. \n\nThe garbage in the back of the restaurant is disgusting. I took pictures, and will contact the city. It's over spilling with the most vile contents. They refuse garbage pick up every week, like they're supposed to, and opt for every 2 weeks. The smell is just awful. \n\nThe food is ok. But that's irrelevant. The restaurant is clearly dirty and filthy, and they would rather go about things as cheaply as they can. That disgusts me as a patron. I'm around that restaurant frequently, walk by it everyday, and it's a disgrace. They obviously don't care about following the health code in this city. \n\nWill never go back.
