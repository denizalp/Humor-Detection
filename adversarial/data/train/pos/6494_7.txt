Not great....\n\nIn fact, I can't understand  the glowing reviews of this location.  Perhaps, as the owners so charmingly posted in a previous review, I just \"don't get it\".  I thought that the rather \"charming\" experience I had at Layers was simply the result of the owner or employee having a bad day but now I can see it is just part of the culture of this company. \n\nI came to this location with my child, who is rather rambunctious I can attest...but who was treated a bit more like he had some kind of airborne disease.  A look at their website will show you the kind of attitude that they seem to have towards the family oriented customer.  \n\nWhat's the charm in a place that treats its customers poorly?  I cannot believe that you suggested that a customer bring back their child's cake so that you could tell them what was wrong with it...or more accurately I imagine that you would tell them what was wrong with \"them\".  \n\nNot friendly, not spectacular food and horrible customer service skills.
