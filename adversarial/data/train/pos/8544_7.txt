I am writing this review as a person who only comes to Gracies to party. I know it's a restaurant during the day so do not read this if that is the review you are interested in... BUT if you are interested in getting fucked up, dancing and slamming Jagger Bombs until 2 am, then this is the review for you my friends.\n\nGood old Gracies. Gracies Gracies Gracies, what can I even say... Gracies will always hold a special place in my heart. \n\nBouncers have been the same since I moved downtown and started going there 6-7 years ago, strictly business kind of guys but do a fantastic job keeping everybody safe and never power trip, they have always been fair and have even helped me out in a pinch a couple times. Bartenders are cool. Drink specials always changing. Reasonably priced booze. Music changes back and forth from live bands to top 40 which is fun. Usually by the time \"My sex is on fire\" comes on you're too fucked up to care what's playing anyways.\n\nWanted to dock a few stars because I met my ex girlfriend here but I know it wasn't Gracie's fault... and we did have some good times I guess.\n\nPlace gets packed, Thursdays are busiest. Still solid Friday\/Saturday nights.\n\nI love Grace O'Malley's.
