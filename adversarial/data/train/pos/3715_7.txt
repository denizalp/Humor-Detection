The old man is super dishonest, he will proceed to put your diesel through the dyno test knowing that you already failed the visual and take your $45.\nI would've appreciated the common courtesy of letting me know what needed fixing before taking my money! When I asked him if I bring it back fixed do I need to pay again he replied, \"you can go online and get a $5 off coupon\" I wouldn't recommend this place to my worst enemy! This company will never get another dime out of me or my friends, family, ect!
