I come here for one reason and one reason only. 2 FOR 1 PIZZA TUESDAYS!\n\nFrom 4 pm to midnight tuesdays you can buy one pizza get another free! For every pizza you have to purchase a beverage but I think it's still a good deal!\n\nI have tried every one of their pizzas and I gotta say that my favorites are the Caprese and the Tostada!\n\nCaprese - Has Goat cheese, spring mix leaves, garlic, and balsamic vinegar.\n\nTostada - Has spicy ground sirloin, sausage, refried beans, pico de gallo, lettuce, black olives, cheese, sour cream, guacomole, and cilantro.\n\nAll pizzas are served on a flat bread thin crust which allows you to savor all the flavor that the pizza has to offer. \n\nThe appetizers are fabulous as well. I usually get the Maui Waui Fries with shrimp or the Calamari.\n\nMaui Waui Fries with Fried Shrimp - For just two bucks more, you might as well get this option instead of the fries themselves. You actually get a decent amount of shrimp. As for the fries, they come with grilled onion and jalapeno slices.\n\nCalamari - Deep fried to a golden crisp with not a lot of batter so you get more of the fantastic squid that tastes good with the marinara sauce that comes with it.\n\nFrom what I heard, their hot wings are awesome as well judging by the orders that I have seen on other tables. \n\nService is phenomenal and I can vouch for it because I have been here at least 4 times. That's pretty good considering I live in North Las Vegas. All 4 of my visits I have yet to complain about anything! \n\nSome random info: They are open 24 hours. Since they are right across the movie theater, tuesdays are 6 dollar movie days! Combine that with the special here and you're set! So dinner and a movie should not put a big dent in your wallet!\n\nSo what are you waiting for? The very next tuesday you should check it out! Although if you cant wait then go whenever you want! They are 24 hours so be my guest! I just recommend you take full advantage of the 2 for 1! Happy eating!
