DO NOT COME HERE! Myself and a friend had food poisoning about an hour after eating here. It was most likely from the meat because our other friend was fine and the only thing she didn't eat was the meat. \n\nWe were extremely ill and this caused us to miss out on our seminar for work. Why is that fact important? Because we paid hundreds of dollars to attend this seminar and whoever contacted me when I just wanted to share my experience so that they were aware and could take better measures to make sure this doesn't happen to anyone else, wanted to insult me by offering me a refund of $12! NOT WHAT I WANTED AT ALL. A simple apology and being told they would follow up with the location and make sure food is being prepped and cooked properly is all that was needed. My friend also sent in her experience but no one contacted her. Clearly they also need to work on their customer service. \n\nSide note: We were not drunk nor were we drinking so that's not why we were sick.
