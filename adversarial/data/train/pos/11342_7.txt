Chito's Pizza is a hot closet on Bloor where everything is weird and notable. Spanish namesake, serving Italian pizza, topped with middle eastern shawarma, owned and run by Albanians. This place should be given some kind of CHIN Picnic Toronto Diversity Award.\n\nThe chicken-piled slice of pizza plus a pop costs $3.50, no tax. I haven't crunched the numbers, but I'm pretty sure it's a tremendous calorie and protein-to-dollar ratio, so I advise every homeless person to eat there. If you're not homeless, it feels like you're getting away with something at these prices. Maybe bring an extra dollar for a tip, or perhaps a fan to cool off the face of the whoever is making your crazy shawarma pizza while standing over an open pizza oven in August.\n\nONE STAR REMOVED for the promise of FREE DELIVERY on their signage and flyers that doesn't actually exist.
