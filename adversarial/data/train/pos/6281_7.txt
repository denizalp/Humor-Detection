Tops surprised me. I was expecting a liquor store right next to campus to be full of just the basic necessities. Instead, I found isles and isles of import and microbrews as well as almost every variety and make of liquor. The wine section is quite sizable too. I love how they stock many beers--even the rare ones--in both the freezer and at room temperature so you can decide how you will enjoy it. My friends and I love to go in and get a variety of different brews. \n\nI've had mixed results with the staff. Some have been very nice and helpful. Some have been dismissive, unknowledgable, and even upset regarding my beer questions. My question is: why would you hire people that think rare beers are for snobs at a store that specializes in rare beers?
