With other parking areas raising rates lately, I tried Sky Harbor Parking a few times over the past two months.  \n\nWhen I tried calling them for rate details I had a hard time reaching them.  This made sense later when I found that the young lady at the guard shack was the one answering the phones after hours, and that if someone was trying to exit the lot she would be serving them and therefore unable to immediately answer inbound lines.\n\nThere is an area for covered parking which you can get if you call ahead to reserve a spot and pay an extra fee.  They also offer coupons which can knock off a few bucks here and there.\n\nIt seemed that their shuttles ran less frequently than some of the other companies, but that is hard to fully quantify.  I do know that upon my arrival back at Sky Harbor, I saw three \"Preflight\" and two \"Parking Spot\" shuttles before I saw one Sky Harbor Parking shuttle.  Both of those services are more expensive though.\n\nI found the lot itself difficult to navigate with my car, my initial impression was that \"they just put cars anywhere.\"  This is probably because I'd always used the larger, more structured parking lots before...and I also found out that a few parking spots were blocked off for re-striping which may have gummed up the works a bit.\n\nI had a TERRIFIC shuttle driver on the way to the airport.  He knew several travelers by name, was upbeat and personable and wished us each a safe trip.  Little things like that can really brighten your whole day, and give you something pleasant to think about while TSA is groping you.
