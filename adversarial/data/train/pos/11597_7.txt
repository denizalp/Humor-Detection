This is like a random treasure spot in Phoenix next to a random pawn shop and a title loan place. Anyway, it's a small market but they have some pretty good stuff here. Sauces, noodles, refrigerated goods, drinks, snacks, curry, etc. You won't find any fresh produce but it will surely save you the trouble of going into Tempe or Mesa for the bigger Asian markets if you need something quick. The workers even speak Japanese to you. It's great!!!
