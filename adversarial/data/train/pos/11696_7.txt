I've thrown my share of gutter balls but I love throwing them at Twin Lanes the best!  \n\nWhen you turn off of Chester, you're first welcomed by the Twin Lanes bowling sign which looks like it was just plopped on an old abandoned building.  Boarded up, maybe...but it's still open!  Just make sure you park in their parking lot because you might get car jacked if you leave your vehicle on the street.  Word to the wise! \n\nThen when you enter in the lanes, you're greeted by the sweet smells of nacho cheese, ranch dressing and bowling oil.  Plus the Twins (Tim and Tom) usually have on some sort of Turner Classic Movie or if you're really lucky, a Cavs game to distract you from the two guys at the end-lane who are real bowlers and keep getting loud strikes.  Bleh to them and their arm guards and...strikes!  \n\nI first found Twin Lanes when I joined a league there way back in the day.  The Twins still remember me, and strangely always are asking me if I'm married yet.  I think it's because their nephew had a crush on me\/every single girl that bowled with us.  Ahh...if I'd only played my cards right, maybe I could have had a stake in Twin Lanes!  \n\nThe bowling games are cheap and often they don't charge you fully.  Not quite sure if it's because they are  nice or because they're generally defeated by life...but whatever...free shoe rentals!  Plus the food is almost all $3 or less.  I can eat enough processed cheese nachos\/chili cheese fries to make me sick, plus bowl, plus grab a PBR all for under $10.  \n\nIt's no wonder the last piece of \"advertising\" they got was how they were going to go belly-up in 2008.  Well, they haven't.  Thank goodness for me.
