At one time this was the Post Office that serviced Crafton borough completely. It has been years since they have done that. Instead, it is a regular Post Office primarily for PO boxes and outgoing mail. All Crafton Borough mail comes from the Greentree office.\n\nDue to lack of staff there is always only one person behind the counter so be prepared to wait if you have to mail a parcel. Best time to go is around mid day when the lines may not be as bad. It does have a mail drop but it does not offer passport services.  They have one thing in their favor in that they have Sat hours but those are extremely limited. For the most part I find it handy when I have to mail letters since I know they have 3 pickup times rather than wait for the mail girl to hopefully find a piece of outgoing mail in my box. Plus it is very close to my house.\n\nLike everything else Postal rates have increased tremendously. All mail or packages are based on weight not distance. Also be aware of what custom's form you need if you are doing an international shipment. I'm usually given one and then later find out I have to do the long one. The only helpful tool is on their website so you can learn international postal codes. But hey, it's like everything else. You need them so you got to pay for their services.\n\nJust learn to be patient when you get there. It may take a while before they get to you.
