Out of nowhere, my son asked if we could go to Bojangles. He begged me for a week. \n\nThe day he had off from school, we went to the movies. I promised him we would go to \"Bojayjay\" after the movie. That word just popped into my head. It had a ring to it. Before the movie, he said, \"Dad, we're gonna eat some Bojayay after this, right?\" \n\nThat's when it hit me. What had I done?! It wasn't intentional, I promise. I realized where I got that word from. \n\nThis Bojangles didn't have any legs, and we were told the wait would be seven minutes (sounds about right). I was forced to go for the breast and thigh, but that was fine. They were decent. \n\nFries were over-seasoned. Biscuit was blah. Green beans tasted like mush (I ate one). On top of that, location was dirty (including dumpster in parking lot). Sticky floors inside. Relaxing atmosphere though since we ate at odd time. \n\nOverall, I would not recommend. However, I don't like fast food.
