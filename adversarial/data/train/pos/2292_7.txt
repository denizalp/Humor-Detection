There's a lot to like about a personally owned business in this economy.  I find this store to be my first suggested alternative to a Williams Sonoma or BBB.  The pricing is better in some respects, and you aren't buying a lot of shiny crap with some random name on it.  You don't need Rachel Ray's pots.  She doesn't even use them.\n\nGreat selection of quality knives and pans.  They're predominantly restaurant grade, and I feel comfortable with using them in my home and work kitchens.  They also do knife sharpening.  A lot of the other items you might need, from spatulas to piping tips, are available here as well.  If you're shopping for yourself or for a gift to kitchen oriented types, this place is worth the visit, as well as the nearby Penzey's.\n\nSupport (quality) local!
