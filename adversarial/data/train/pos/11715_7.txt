If I could give Arbor Care Tree Service and Howard a 10 star rating, I would! Howard is the most knowledgeable and patient person ever! He totally knew his stuff and would take the time to explain everything to you. I had contacted him to get an estimate on my tree because it needed a good trimming. He went over either that same day or the next and gave me a quote. Their pricing is probably the best in the valley, no joke. Call them. I dropped the ball and didn't move forward with the trimming right away and a huge part of a tree branch broke off.  Now, my tree would need to be removed. I called him and he gave me a quote for tree removal, which again is the best pricing in town! They removed my tree in about 20 min. Howard and his crew are fast! Arbor Care Tree Service will the ONLY company that I ever call for any tree services I may need in the future. \n\nI can't say enough about Howard and his crew, professional, honest, and friendly! Give them a call now before your tree has to suffer the same fate as mine!
