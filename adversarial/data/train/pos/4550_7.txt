Disappointing. I expected more from this place, especially considering all the raving reviews and the fact that Michael Mina owns this place. The complimentary fries were pretty good. Basically, the fries were provided in three stainless steel cups, with each cup filled with different flavored fries: parmesan, truffle, and duck fat. I also tried the West\/East coast oysters. Those were too fishy for me...maybe the flights that shipped those oysters were delayed. My party ordered a few appetizers of which was the bone marrow. The marrow was topped with an overwhelming amount of onions. The richness of the marrow disappeared, as a result. \n\nNow onto the main event. I had the NY Strip cooked medium rare. It was cooked perfectly, but served warm. Tasted similar to meat cooked an hour ago which sat under a warming lamp; similar to a buffet. Don't get me wrong, the meat tasted dry aged, but the temperature of the meat threw me off. \n\nService was generally okay, except when my party asked for another set of complimentary fries, we got rejected and was told..$6 please. I expected more from a place that sells $50-75 steaks. \n\nI really wanted to like this place because of the brand and reputation, but unfortunately...I've experienced better.
