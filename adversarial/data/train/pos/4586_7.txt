Considering my friends and I were partially hung over, didn't have much sleep, and were hungry as all heck, this was my savior. My friend Nate decided that the chicken soup (wasn't sinigang or nilaga) was to help him sober up. It's cafeteria style when it comes to getting the rice. It's the community rice cooker, but hey, it's clean. I just wished they had more choices. I did love the fact they had fried chicken skin. Rawr. Overall, good and decent prices. Just be sure to pay, the cashier was a nazi last time we went. I guess several people would just get plates and start helping themselves without paying for the meal. Whoops.
