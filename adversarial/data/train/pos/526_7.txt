The absolute BESTEST gourmet chocolate I have ever tasted.....EVAR\n\nPooped from a day of running all over The Strip, we meander into Caesars Forum Shops, not really thinking we'd find anything except for a nice bench to sit & rest our weary selves when out of the corner of our eyes, we see this rich, deep, vibrant purple sign - like a siren, it called us over\n\nWhat a delight to find this Haut-Chocolat Boutique....ultra-high-end boutique & boy oh boy is it worth it\n\nWe got Caramels infused w\/ Salty Pecans, Tupelo Honey & Bee Pollen, Blood Orange, Argentinean dulce de leche & Costa Rican cashews......just to name a few \n\nExotic Truffles infused w\/ Lavender, Curry, Chili Peppers....among other super-cool shtuff\n\nCollezione Italiana Truffles infused w\/ Taleggio Cheese (yeah, really!), Balsamic Vinegar, Olive Oil-White Chocolate w\/ Dried Kalamata Olives....not *even* kidding\n\nAll packed for us in a nice bag w\/ freezer packs to keep it all cool - fantastic idea!\n\nWhile waiting for our goodies to be packed up, Sis & I indulged in 2 of their drinking Chocolates - Sis the White Chocolate w\/ Lemon & Lavender - nice & light w\/ a strong Lavender flavor (in a *very* good way)\n\nMe - Dark Chocolate w\/ Cinnamon & Chipotle Chillies - rich & luscious, coating the throat going down w\/ the kick of the chili only coming as a pleasant aftertaste\n\nSuper-nice peeps, tons of free samples given & we walked outta there, our wallets much, much lighter but our brains much much happier\n\nOh - BTW - since all their chocolates are organic, it is recommended to eat w\/in 7 days.....THIS will not be a problem
