I am composing a review that has been repressed for quite some time. I had told myself I was not going to review Olive Garden. After all, I have better things to share with Yelp, but... the evil marinara trick still haunts me! Read on...\n\nI too fell victim to the lure of the all you can eat soup and salad and bread sticks. We were leaving our Red Rock staycation, and we were in a hurry, so it seemed like the perfect plan. We sat at the bar because that seemed the speedy thing to do. I ordered, went to the restroom, and when I returned there was a saucer of marinara for dipping our bread sticks.\n\n\"That's cool,\" I proclaimed to my hub and started dipping. It wasn't too delicious, so I didn't dip that much. I then proceeded to eat sub par iceberg lettuce salad with a bland dressing and equally bland soup. The whole time I was thinking I could have just gone to Smith's and bought a bag of iceberg and a can of any soup on the shelf, saved money and had a more enjoyable lunch. \n\nThen, the bill arrived, and our shallow dish of wannabe Prego marinara was $4. I think an artery busted in my head I was so upset. We had been had. Apparently, while I was in the bathroom, our server had asked if we would like some marinara with our bread, and based on her delivery, my husband assumed it was complimentary. Wrong!\n\nBland food, tricky servers and overpriced marinara means I will not return.
