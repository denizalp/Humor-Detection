This place is a huge improvement over Le Peep which previously occupied this space.  I eat here most weekends and have never had poor service and the food has always been consistently good.  This is a step up from the usual Good Egg, Chompies, any bagel joint type choices that you have in Scottsdale.  Lines start to form after 9am on weekends so plan accordingly.
