Great customer service, knowledgeable and motivated folks, great atmosphere...and great coffee. Plus drive thru! And free Wi-Fi! And really sweet tunez! And comfy overstuffed leather chairs\/beautifully-stained wooden bistro chairs and tables! And superior hand-made coffee drinks! :-) \n\nYou might just think this is + the + best place to get a cuppa joe. They also have really good smoothies. My favorite is the mango.\n\nLook, it's simple. This is a small family run place trying to make a go of it. They compete (effectively, in my opinion) with multi-national conglomerate chains and franchises with vastly superior cost structures and exponentially-developed corporate-class support. This is just a gal with encouragement and support from her family and help from whatever employees she can attract serving the best products they can at the best price they can.\n\nIn the end, it's a consumable product like a mango smoothie or a cafe latte...but it's the people behind the product and these people deserve support and patronage.  \n\nThis is the kind of business I like in my neighborhood: independent, entrepreneurial, jobs-creating\/jobs-supporting, ExtraGoodGoodKarmaâ„¢ producing businesses.\n\nLocated off Blue Diamond and Decatur in the Albertson's shopping center, consider choosing Beanz Coffee Cafe for your next hang out, coffee date, or caffeine fix. You'll be glad you did. I know I am.\n\nAsk for a rewards card...and a free coffee cup (while supplies last).\n\nYeah, I'm totally digging this place. Only one regret: not being \"first to review\".
