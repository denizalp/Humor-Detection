As Megan D. said, the staff will make you feel like a criminal. I went in the store with my girlfriend and the first thing we asked the manager was if we could take pictures. We told her if it was an issue we would leave our cameras in the car. She told us it was fine and we were there for an hour snapping away and having a grand time. As we made our way to the front she tells me that I am clogging the aisle and that she needs to see my ID. She told me that security told her to take it. I then asked where the security people are located and she said that they had left. Further into the conversation she said that the manager told her to take it. I asked who the manager was and she said there was no manager and proceeded to say security had asked for it. I called her out on the inconsistency of the story and she said she never said that she told me that a manager asked her to take the information. One of the employees finally took me to the side while she was helping a customer and told me that she was the manager and was concerned I was casing the place to later rob it. She accused me of taking pictures of the security system and being too detailed with my shots. I'm a photographer and all I was looking for was nice pictures. I insisted that she watch as I deleted all photos that I took, but she said all she needed was my information. Needless to say, I will not be coming back to this antique store. The items are priced too high and many things are not even antiques. This experience ruined a rather fun day up to that point.
