we came here for pre dinner cocktail drink. I went with a st michelle riesling and mr h went with a blue moon. nice bar and our server's name was Lynne. she was pleasant and quickly brought out our drinks. I don't normally eat at CJ 's because the portions are ginormous but I do like them for a quick drink, happy hour and maybe an appetizer to share. i would suggest folks have dinner here if they want to get super full and burpy.
