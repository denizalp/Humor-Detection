I lost my professional partner in crime when she went to work at Handybook, so I want to dislike them, because you know, spite. Alas, their product is just too. Darn. Good. \n\nWhen asked to describe Handybook, I say it's like Uber for all of your home service needs. Cleaning professionals and handy people to do odd jobs around the house are a click away. It's an easy to use app, and I'm really impressed by it. This is the first time I've had a cleaning lady as an adult, and it certainly won't be the last time. I was instantly hooked. \n\nI was moving and I needed someone to do a once over before I gave the keys back to the landlord. Nothing like moving all of your furniture to remind you how disgusting you are and force you into a minor existential crisis: Where did all that grime come from? Have I ever swept under there? How am I alive? Will I be a fit mother? Maybe I should just have pets? Ew, imagine how dirty my apartment would have been with pets, etc. \n\nThe cleaning professional did a bang up job, and this service let's me know that I'm going to be OK in life. Coming home to a sparkling clean house is just nice, y'know? Treat yo'self. \n\nSince you're still reading this review, you're a Yelper, and they have a code for you: http:\/\/www.handybook.com\/yelplove29 Why 29? Because your first three hour cleaning is only $29! Hooray!
