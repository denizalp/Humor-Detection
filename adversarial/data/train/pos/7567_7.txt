Walked in here instead because the Aria Race and Sports Book next door was full. Seahawks-Panthers game was playing. It's a non-smoking area still so it was all good. \n\nWe enjoyed our Bloody Mary and Mimosas plus the TRUFFLE MAC N CHEESE while waiting for our airport pick up. This place was packed after 12 noon. Wow. \n\nIf we weren't full or ran more miles that early morning,we could have tried their pizza because it's a pizza place! \n\nHelpful and friendly staff. Clean with decent chalk writings on the walls. Busy place for sure.
