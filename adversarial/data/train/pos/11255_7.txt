So here's the low down on this place. So you come to Vegas and you might have failed at the pre-partying so you arrive at the club and you are shocked by the prices of all the drinks at the clubs. $20 a pop and even $10 for a mini size bottle of water because they won't serve you plain iced tap water. So you still get a round of drinks you are down $200 in a matter of five minutes. That is for reals a bummer. You aren't going to find anything cheap in Vegas unless you are sitting at a table or slot machine and waiting for the cocktail ladies to come by and then you tip her for her courteous delivery of your drink. But that takes forever and by the time she comes by, you might also be down $150 in blackjack...\n\nSo Centrifuge is right outside Hakkasan. So why would you want to pay $20 for a drink when you can pay $10 or even less? So you must arrive at Hakkasan a bit early to ensure that you can still get in or else you are just as screwed because you will be waiting in a massive line and your buzz will be gone. Anyways, definitely come here for the cheaper price drinks. When I went, they had a beer and shot special for $8. That's like winner winner chicken dinner in my book. The drinks themselves are OK. Nothing too special but seriously, they taste the same inside Hakkasan anyways; the bump to 4 stars is really for the deal that you will be getting for drinking out here right before entering the club and paying an arm and a leg. Why not use that extra money and put it on #00 at the roulette tables?
