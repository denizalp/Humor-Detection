Went here after the beer festival and I must say, having a cookie place open late at night is amazing! My friend bought my cookie so I am not sure how much it cost, but I got the peanut butter cup one and it was seriously delicious! It had that warm fresh baked feeling with the outside being oh so slightly crispy and the inside soft melt in your mouth goodness. It's a pretty decent sized cookie so you could theoretically share, but nah. \n\nTaking off a star because there is no place to sit and enjoy your cookie even though there is plenty of space for a couple stools. I was told they aren't allowed to have seating since they don't have a public restroom, but I'm skeptical on that.\n\n\n*Update, I am not sure I used the word theoretically right so if not, insert the word technically, but that could be wrong too, so just stop reading my reviews if you're an English professor.
