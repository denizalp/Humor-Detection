I'm going to give these guys at least a solid 4 stars because...\n\nA) they were extremely accomodating for a steadily growing group which ended up being around 13 people (from our initial estimate of 7) in various states of inebriation showing up 1\/2 hour before the kitchen closed on a Sunday night. \n\nB) they were very courteous and friendly to said growing group of 13 people in various states of inebriation throughout the entire meal. No scowly face. No sad face. No rolly eyes.\n\nC) their teriyaki, spicy, and bbq wing platter was awesome, even though personally I couldn't tell the difference between the spicy and the bbq wings. Teriyaki wings were like crack. Maybe I was just really hungry. Who knows.\n\nD) their well-done onion rings? Amazing.\n\nE) and their fries? Pretty good. However, my doctor will not be impressed with what I ate here. \n\nF) and they were totally cool with us cancelling another order of wings when we realized we were in way over our heads\n\nG) I took a bite of my Thai chicken sandwich that I brought home (just for the purpose of this review) and I will say right here right now that it was fairly tasty, although now my stomach is literally about to burst. The sacrifices I make sometimes for this website. I deserve at least one kudo.\n\nH) Nice place. Decent enough vibe although I'd have to come back again for another evaluation since my back was to the restaurant. From my first impression, though, I wouldn't mind sitting at the bar for a post-work drink or having an actual dinner here, or even watching a game. I'd say the only thing lacking was a good music selection, but they've done many other things right tonight to make up for it\n\nI) Alongside Bombero's, a great addition to Sunnyslope on this stretch of Central. Who knew, right? Sunnyslope! \n\nSo a spontaneous decision leads a bunch of wayward people to a  good meal and good drinks. Much appreciation again goes to the Corbin's staff. \n\nWill be back to try some more.
