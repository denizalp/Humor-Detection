Terrible! Don't believe all the hype. This is for OB.  The tour sounded great, of coarse once we actually had the baby totally different story.   The nurse told me they ran out of pillows. How does a hospital run out of pillows? Then she yelled at my spouse to not help me sit up when i needed his help because her lazy ass would not help me. She literally stuck me in a room and left me there.  I was just lucky that my wonderful mom who is also a nurse from a different hospital came to help me. \n\nThank god the shifts changed and they replaced my terrible nurse with an amazing one (she gets five stars).  \n\nSo did things get better after I had the baby? No! More terrible nurses came to pretend help me.  One nurse even said she needs to take my baby because the labs are running behind then walked out of the room with my baby. Which i was told on the tour would never happen.\nI called my husband and made him hunt her down and bring the baby back.\n\nThey forgot to get me my dinner, its okay i only just delivered. \n\nOne nurse told me my baby was too cold and took the baby to warm the baby up after she blamed me for it. Then came back and said that she could not get my babies body temp up and gave the baby back to me. You know why!?!  Because my baby was not COLD!!!! \n\nOne woman, who was nice but annoying spent a hour trying to get my baby to latch. My baby would not because she was SLEEPY!! Once the nursing police left my baby latched on her own 5 hours later.\n\nSo overall...staff was lazy, rude, annoying, incompetent, and pushy. \n\nHad i know this i would have went to a different hospital.
