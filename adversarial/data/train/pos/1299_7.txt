My vacuum was losing suction so I brought it in to get it checked out to see what the issue was. I was worried it was going to be an expensive fix or that I would have to replace the entire vacuum. With a quick evaluation, the guy that was helping me determined that one of my connection pieces was broken so my hose wasn't connecting and I was indeed losing suction. He replaced it for me for just the cost of the part as a first time repair courtesy. It ended up being a $20 fix and my vacuum was good as new. While I was waiting for him to replace the part, I played with the other vacuums, fans, and the blow dryer. I love Dyson products and will continue to be a very loyal customer.
