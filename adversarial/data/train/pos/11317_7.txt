Nice location! Sunday is a great day to go you can get a ton of samples. Yes, it's crowded it's like everyone and their mama decided to go to Costco on a Sunday, but it's some good deals so I can see why. There is plenty of parking but the massive lot and shared lot next door at lows was crowded. The staff really work their butts off to get you through the check out Line in a timely manner and for that I am very appreciative. No one wants to stand in line forever. I hope other stores can take note and have a more efficient check out process. The location is prime where within walking distance (or a short drive) you can go to several other stores. They have a good station in the front and coupon mailing books.
