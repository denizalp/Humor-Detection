This shop is an absolute joke. Everyone who actually collects, authenticates, and witnesses signatures of these stars knows this shop is nothing but a gamble each time. \nI'd say 90% of the store is full of fake autographs.\nThese are most horrifically signed Star Wars autographs you will ever see. \nEven at that, everything is insanely overpriced and not even close to true values. \nThe shop owners or employees all have an attitude. Guess they are always stressed for selling nothing but junk.\nSuch a shame, I hope anyone who visits Vegas hears about this shop and stays away. I feel bad for the unsuspecting tourists and fans that don't know any better, but fall into this trap store.
