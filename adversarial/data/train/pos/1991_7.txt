I have had things printed here three times and all three times they have been wrong. They were not complex orders - print this .pdf and bind it, x3.\n\nThe service is beyond terrible - there is no sense of urgency at all for any of the staff and they will stand behind the counter and look down until you shout HELLO! at them. Then they will lumber over to you and say they don't have your order, and you will say \"then why did you call me and say it was ready\" and they will say \"mumble mumble mumble I'll do it now I guess...\" \n\nI have considered buying a printer and a coil binding machine for my house so I don't have to go here anymore. \n\nPros:\n- they sell pilot hi-tec gel pens\n- cheap routers\n- proximity to my house
