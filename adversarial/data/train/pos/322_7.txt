I was introduced to this place by a friend and the first thing I liked about it was the service! I was ordering takeout and all the servers seemed extremely friendly. If you do go here make sure to say Hi to Helena. She has the best photographic memory, and will remember you and your name right after the first meeting! In terms of food, they have quite an extensive list of the regular Hakka Chinese dishes. The sizzlers are really good, and if you want it more spicy, they are more than willing to do that!!! Do check it out and if you run into Helena let her know that you were directed to RJ by Kevin lol. Enjoy!!'
