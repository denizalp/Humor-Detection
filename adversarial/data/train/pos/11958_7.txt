I really wanted to like this place since I live nearby and I welcome having another good restaurant close, but this wasn't it. The menu was extremely un-vegetarian friendly and they only offered one meatless dish that was an entree. The waiter was a friendly guy and the the food was okay, but not outstanding. The decor was too modern and lacked character, stylized Greek decor, not to my liking at all. The lounge act style music was way too loud and didn't fit into the Greek restaurant concept at all. I was hoping for something that provided a more Greek experience and will be going else where next time.
