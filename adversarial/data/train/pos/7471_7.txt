Great restaurant! Lots of good music and fun music videos on the screens. For 4.95$ each plate, I was very satisfied. \n\nI ordered the bacon potato skins and the mac and cheese.\nThe potato skins were a really nice change from ordinary fries.\nHowever, I am very particular about mac and cheese. I have high standards. Sadly, this one did not meet them. The pasta wasn't the traditional mac and cheese pasta and the cheese had a sort of slightly spicy taste which ruined the actual cheese taste I wanted. It wasn't the worst I've had (See joe's panini mac and cheese) but it was disappointing. \n\nMy boyfriend got the smoky burger and the beets and goat cheese salad. He really struck gold with the burger. It was so good!!! I'm going to have to go back just to order one for myself. I also really want to try the tacos. \n\nFor now it's a four stars because of the mac and cheese. But it was really close to being a five. \n\n\nVisited on the 8th of December 2016
