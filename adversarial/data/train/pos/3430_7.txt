Although barbecue in the northern part of these United States is still hit or miss, I tried Union Pig on the advice of my husband, who went here without me (!) on his first visit. He is knowledgeable on the topic of barbecue, and even pickier than I am, and he deemed it worthy of another visit. Together we write a barbecue blog and spend some of the winter months in the southeastern U.S., always on the hunt for both the latest barbecue and long standing local favorites. So while we're not exactly experts on the subject, we've gnawed our way through many a rack of ribs.  And I have to say, after sampling the offerings here, that it's pretty darn good. The ribs especially were satisfying... tender, meaty and well smoked, with a nice rub and a sauce served on the side that complements the meat very well. We also shared some of the pork, which I hesitate to describe as pulled or chopped, as it's prepared in larger than bite sized cubes. This was a little weird to me, as I've never in my travels seen pork shoulder done this way, but it was good, so I'm not going to complain too much. The collard greens were nicely prepared, if a tad bit spicy...that's another thing I have a hard time getting over; Southerners don't really do spicy when it comes to barbecue, either the meat or the sides, so I find it off putting. But I'm splitting hairs here, as the greens were good. All in all, Union Pig is good eats, and I think we have another visit planned for later in the week. I will agree with the other folks here who were a bit shocked at the prices. This is the most I've ever spent on barbecue. Maybe if they had a little more competition for smoked meats of this quality in the area...who knows?
