I purchased  2 King's Cakes for Fat Tuesday (work party).  I was originally going to actually make the cakes myself until I thought to call Barb's Bakery.  I drive by there all the time and see the cute sign with the muffin for an \"a\" in Barb's name.  They had king cakes and not too pricey!  So I went over and picked them up.... I could just sit in the bakery and sniff the air for a living but since I have a theory that smelling something good instantly makes my thighs fatter, I will pass.\n\nThe King Cakes were tasty (so I hear).\n\nI want to go back and get some cookies or something to see how those taste. \n\n4 stars for Barb's!
