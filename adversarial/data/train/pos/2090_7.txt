Toast was the families go to Brunch spot on Sundays.  Being from the north were there is great diners all over, it was a challenge to find a good breakfast place.\n\nI live in Northern CLT and it is about a 20 minute commute is always worth it at Toast. \nNot to mention I love the small town of Davidson.  Toast was first introduced to me when they were in Huntersville.  i have been there atleast once a month since.  \n\nThey all around have a great breakfast menu and are usually fast and friendly staff.\n\nThe service is great.  All staff works together so you are not just waiting on one person. \n\nThey also serve bread with apple spread at every table.  This is great to occupy the 3 year old until she gets her pancakes!
