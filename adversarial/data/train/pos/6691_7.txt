I work in the office building directly at the bottom of the hill from the Lizard. Every day a couple guys \"go up the hill\" for drinks after work. This is a great place to come for lunch, dinner or drinks to discuss corporate stuff. The $7 soup and salad lunch combo is excellent. The wings are great. The view of Cleveland from high on the bluff is the best in the southern hills area.
