Headed back to Lobby's. How I missed this tasty burger. I wasn't disappointed with round 2. The burger was still fantastic! I'm also happy that the fries were a little bit less salty than my previous trip. \n\nWith any burger purchase, getting the combo pack (fries\/soda) is the smart choice.\n\nI do wish that they would lose the styrofoam soda cups and offer more than one size of drinks.\n\nMake sure to grab plenty of napkins before you sit down. The burger can make a mess with the homemade sauce dripping off the meat and bun. That's a good thing in my opinion!
