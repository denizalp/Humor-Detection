I try and stay away from these types of Places they lose so much quality ... A friend of mine said it was \"Pretty Good\" he is the same guy who says\" 2 Pop Tarts and a Mountain Dew is a pretty \" Good \" Breakfast!. Ok so I said to myself I will humor him! As I walk in I see a pretty nice water fall I guess they are trying to give the place a little more upscale appeal!\n      This place has got to be The Mac Daddy of Buffets! As big as a football field!  No less than 100 items or it seems!! I am going to try and mention some of the items;\nPizza, Fried Mushrooms, Peel and eat shrimp, claims, broiled and fried fish and shrimp,beef &broccoli,Sushi, Soups 4 or 5 types\nHibachi Grill they cook it you pick your meat pork,chicken,beef, and then pick your vegetables of about 20! Chicken Wings 'Sesame chicken,fries, Egg Rolls And Spring rolls Salad with about 20 ingredients Soft serve Ice cream with 20 toppings,Deserts cookies ,cakes AND MUCH MUCH MORE!\n          Ok so your get you plate and pick your vise. I swear for the Life of me do not understand why people do not know that any kind of seafood under constant heat will turn to rubber or worse! Thats the quality thing on Buffets that is lost!\n          I am giving this place 3 stars for being a very Clean place as you can see by the pictures! They had a pretty good sushi selection ..not the best of seafood but, they had a wide selection. And they had a pretty good Salad mix ..And of course for The Mac Daddy Size .. In this case size matters some what...
