An overpriced bakery in the heart of the Aria hotel, but with top quality food. We came here for breakfast and had the key lime tart and raspberry donut. Both were great, but as I said overpriced. \n\nI've come to realize that everything is Vegas is overpriced, and this location is no exception. Still, the food is really good and you can sit back and relax while enjoying top notch desserts. Thumbs up despite the pricing here.
