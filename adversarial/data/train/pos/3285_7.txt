Been here a few times. It's a pretty solid place to play darts and relax. Lots of nice dart boards. Good atmosphere, too. The lighting is dialed in just right, and they play cool music videos on several non-sports screens.\n\nOverall, the place is clean and well maintained. Service is good; bartender really hustles behind the bar and does table service, too. Drink specials are OK, nothing out of this world, and I'm not a huge fan of plastic beer mugs. Cocktails seem to be light on booze. Food looks pretty decent from what I saw other people getting, and the specials are damn good. \n\nHowever, as is becoming a cancer all over Phoenix bars, this place seems to think that vaping is OK to do indoors. When playing darts here last week, we had to walk out it was so bad. My eyes were watering and it smelled like the inside of an ass mixed with cotton candy from all the douchers with oral fixations sucking on alcohol and oil smoke. Seriously gross, why not just allow smoking? \n\nIf you don't mind the possibility of vape stench, this is a great bar. I will come back, but I guess it'll have to be earlier in the day before the goombas come out to stink up the place.
