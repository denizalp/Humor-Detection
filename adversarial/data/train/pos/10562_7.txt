Chicken tandoori panini! \n\nRight before watching Cirque du Soleil's show Zarakana, my cousins and I stopped by for a quick bite at Jean Philippe Patisserie. On a normal foodie occasion, I would've gotten some of their beauiful looking pretty sweets but we hadn't eaten anything solid yet so we all chose to get sandwiches. My sandwich of choice was the chicken tandoori panini!\n\nThey make their paninis fresh to order and my panini came out fresh and hot! I was in love at first bite. This was one tasty sandwich! It had tender chicken breast, curry mayo and veggies. The curry flavor was so good. It wasn't too overwheming but just had the right kind of kick. The panini itself was pretty big and definitely fulfilling.\n\nThe chicken tandoori panini here is deifnitely one of the best sandwiches I've ever had.
