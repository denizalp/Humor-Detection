I've literally been coming here for YEARS, according to my original Yelp review. I can't say that about many restaurants. This is seriously my favorite and because I don't live in CLE anymore, I can't just have it any time I want. I can only have it when I'm in town visiting my in-laws. It's made me sad, but it makes me appreciate it that much more. I thought about giving it 4 stars this time around, but I just can't bring it down. \n\nWhy would I give it a star less? Simply because...we tried to stop in with my in-laws and nephew one afternoon at 4:30pm while we were in town (this is when they open), and the hostess dude was being a snot and not very welcoming to us. We wanted to sit at a table, but he didn't want to give it to us because they had a reservation set for 6pm, he said. Completely ridiculous, considering that would've allowed us 1.5 hours to eat our meal and leave, which we definitely would have done. His overall demeanor just wasn't up to par with the service I've typically received there. I'm really not sure who he thought he was, and I didn't get his name, but I don't think he should represent this place. \n\nRegardless, we didn't get to eat there that night and returned on another (yep, that's how much I love it). The sushi is still excellent. I think after a while of being gone, I've decided the Eye of the Tiger is my ultimate favorite. In fact, we ordered TWO of these. And yeah, that ginger martini is still da bomb dot com. I had 2 of those as well, but don't mind me because I can't help myself! \n\nLastly, what I love about this particular sushi joint is that it is the overall an experience that you can't just get at any Japanese restaurant. You don't feel like you're in the middle of Cleveland, OH but in the middle of Japan somewhere. I wish Dante would open a place like this for me in Denver, CO (HINT)! I'd be a full-blown supporter.
