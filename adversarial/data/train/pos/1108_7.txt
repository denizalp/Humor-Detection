Ha-do-Ken!\n\nJust something I thought about when I saw the name of this place.  Ryu Sushi & Teppanyaki is what the name implies; Sushi & Teppanyaki.  Pretty straight forward.  I came with a large group and started with drinks.  Happy Hour can be delightful with great prices!  \n\nThe place itself is large and open and great for groups if you're planning to come.  Teppanyaki style meals are to West of the restaurant and I can see how in a packed house this place can pop!\n\nFor my entree I ordered the Chirashi Don bowl, a rice bowl mixed with crab meat served with seaweed salad, fresh cut vegetables, assorted Sashimi.  Overall, a solid entree, but nothing to exciting for my palate.  As I reviewed the menu nothing really stood out to me as original and quite typical to be honest.  \n\nThe service is very good here so in the end I guess I'm starting to be more picky with my sushi.  I would definitely come back for drinks and a quick bite though! - Enjoy!
