Last Chance is my strip-mall desert oasis where the shoe orphans of Nordies await. Except, prices are even more slashed and for some reason the selection is wild & crazy...like a shoe zoo! ROAR!\r\nLike an orphan who was did partial time in a foster home,  rehab, juvie, and is now back on the market- these shoes are looking for a happy home. And boy, are they ever stoked to come back to SF with me!  \r\nI'll return to SF, with truckloads of hot colored pumps alll less than $20 each! Friends here will look down and gasp! All I have to say is \"Crack Rack\" and their eyes roll in disbelief...
