It's part of their psych to make you wait outside for 30 minutes before letting you in so you can appreciate their semi appropriate air conditioning system.\n\nI liked the U of P stadium though. From the outside it does not appeal much to the eye, a grade above the N.O. dome. But once you're in there you can appreciate the work that they saved for the inside. \n\nThe seating is comfortable, I had aisle seats of course so crushed up  I was not. But shout out to them having cup holders the whole section up, unlike Rogers Center, oops I mean Centre.\n\nTheir alcohol selection sucks, I felt like I was at an event in a small town with how segregated to Budweiser their choices were. \n\nFood? I avoided it but their popcorn was good. Prices for alcohol and food are both cheaper than the usual.\n\nThe view was nice, no problem. At all.\n\nFirst Aid? Oh yeah, I over drank in the heat and ended up chillin with paramedic Sean or was it Shawn? Anyways great way to get free water. They're class acts.\n\nU of P stadium is clean. Nothing that makes me wish it was my teams stadium but nothing that makes me regret ending up here to watch a game.
