This was hands down the best Indian food I have had to date. I had sort of given up on Indian food with most of the restaurants in the Seattle area going to a lunch buffet which is just luke warm gross food like every other buffet I have tried. \n\nI didn't want to spend a lot of money and most of their food is $10 and above so I got the $7 Tandoori Chicken wrap. Sweet mother of Ganesha this was amazing! Tandoori Chicken, vegetables and spices in a very hot very fresh Naan wrap. \n\nThe service was polite and prompt. The place seems to be mostly frequented by the local Indian populations (we were the only non-Indian people in there). \n\nBeing a family restaurant, expect to have kids all around you, being kids.   \n\nOn a side note and I am not sure if this adds or subtracts from the over all authenticity of the experience but the smell coming out of my ass today is like a Mumbai slum! (so I hear) Woooooo Weeeeee........
