I am a VIntage Depot addict (Bloor & Lansdowne location). To be fair, I am something of a thrift store obsessive in general; but in particular, in this area of town which I refer to as...the holy thrift trinity? the axis of great outfit options? the used-clothing district, maybe?--\n\n-- as I was saying, in a location that finds this treasure trove sandwiched in between both a Goodwill and a Value Village, all within a couple blocks (bestill my thrifty heart), I still find it unique in its wealth of options, very reasonable prices- comparable with any Goodwill location- (I know about the price shift inherent in an item's evolution from \"thrift\" to \"vintage\", though I never participate in it), and very amiable owners.\n\nMy first experience there was unequivocally majestic, endowing me with my favourite cardigan and a perfect blue prom dress, and the only times I leave empty handed are due to not waiting long enough in between visits. They carry a good selection of sweaters and t-shirts, a wide variety of jackets, and a larger-than-normal percentage of items that still bear their original price tags. I might be alone in this, but I get, as a veteran vintage shopper, a considerable thrill in seeing those decades-old labels. Why? It's a mystery.\n\nThere is also an inordinate amount of Mickey Mouse-emblazoned merch,  which has started a similar trend in my t-shirt collection (only in his old-school incarnation, of course). Oh, and if you're looking at a rack of yet-to-be-priced goodies and the man behind the counter tells you to come  back tomorrow, listen- cuz the next day they'll be gone.
