How this place has such high reviews is beyond puzzling.  The food is bland, expensive, tiny portions, and to top it off they have no alcohol whatsoever and no plans to ever get any.  $9 for guacamole that was brown and had gigantic chunks of tomato and raw white onion.  Carnitas that were so greasy (and nothing but pulled pork, it is NOT crispy or even remotely authentic) that they ate through the entire soggy tortilla shell.  Takeout is even worse than the dine-in experience as the food literally is saturated with oil and disintegrates before you will even get home.\n\nHave I mentioned THEY DON'T SERVE BEER WITH THEIR TACOS.  That alone warrants a poor review IMO, just ridiculous\n\nTo summarize, I think the value is poor, food below average, and overall just not worth the return visit or recommendation at all
