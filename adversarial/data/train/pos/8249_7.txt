As an AirBnB host we struggle sometimes to give breakfast recommendations out to our guests. Sure we want to send them to Pamela's or Coca for the best taste of what the 'Burgh has to offer, but then you have to explain to them all about the potential waits, when to get there, how to phone in a table, etc. \n\nAlong game Marty's and saved us from all that hassle [for now, until you all read this and ruin our good thing]. We've sent so many satisfied guests to Marty's that it's now our only recommendation. \n\nOf course, we love it ourselves too. The breakfast and lunch menus are simple, short, and tasty. There's usually enough variety for everyone and they stick to what I would consider a just-enough philosophy: you'll always leave full, but never stuffed. That's a good thing, everybody.\n\nTheir ham omelet for breakfast is a household favorite. The griddle bread is amazing and the potatoes are flavorful and crispy. Get a fresh 'green' juice while your at it and add some years onto your life!
