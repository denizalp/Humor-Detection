Located in The Cosmopolitan Hotel.  I actually stumbled upon this place as I was sitting nearby with my friends.  It's so secret that it's literally not even listed on their maps or signs at the Hotel.  There's no sign to the entrance.  It is right next to the Blue Ribbon Sushi Restaurant and near Cosmo's Marquee Nightclub.  They open until like 4-5am usually.  Lines could be long, but this restaurant is a take-out place.  There's only a handful of bar-like stools where you can eat on a counter by a couple of old school game machines.  It's warm, loud, and crowded so I suggest you find a seat outside.  There's a complimentary pool table just in front of the entrance with seats around it.  Our family just ate our pizza there.\n\nWaited 45 minutes for a whole pie of pizza.  It is overpriced, but it was still satisfying.  We ordered half Pepperoni and Half Sausage and Mushroom and it costed about 30 dollars.  They sell liters of soda or beer too.  The pizza was good. I want to come back to try the white pizza slice for sure.  Nothing too special about this place other than the idea that it's a secret. Overly hyped and over priced, but will definitely satisfy your pizza cravings.
