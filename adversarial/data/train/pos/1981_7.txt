Completing our trifecta of food for lunch at the corner of 7th St. and Indian School on Saturday was New Orleans Sno Ball.  \n\nI let the kids choose between this place and Sacred Hogan for a dessert capper after Mamma Mia's pizza.  One went with frybread the other with Sno Ball.\n\nI liked this place immediately.  The congenial and conversant owner made us feel welcome as soon as we walked in.  I recognized that the shaved ice machine was older and more classical looking than the one I am used to seeing at our neighborhood Water & Ice.\n\nAs he began making the shaved ice for my daughter I could see that the product coming out was much finer than we are used to.  My daughter ordered grape flavor and he was so busy chatting with us that he made orange.  He noticed as he was finishing that he had grabbed the wrong flavor and offered a taste before making another one.  My daughter chose to keep the orange.  Light and refreshing!\n\nNow there is only one more location to try at this intersection - Two Hippies burgers.  Perhaps another weekend outing.
