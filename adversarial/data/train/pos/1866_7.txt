Man oh man. This restaurant has got to be one of those places where you wouldn't expect to find great hot and sour soup, but it does. Strangely, this place serves \"Indian Chinese\" food. They have Sichuan style Chinese food but also, serves things like pakoras and Indian influenced food.\n\nThe original owners are ethnically Chinese but worked in India at the Oberoi Hotel. When they moved to Canada, they opened a restaurant and with them brought the influences of their time in India with them. The new owners have retained the restaurant's original flavors, and why not? It has definitely worked -- why change a good thing?\n\nYou will find many Indian clientele in here as well as Chinese. Honestly, this place has the best hot and sour soup I've ever had -- even in Asia -- as they make it with just the right amount of kick to it!\n\nOur friends who are regulars ordered so I'm not sure what the names of the dishes are, but they were all very good!
