After incredibly slow service and average food, we were asked to leave the restaurant because the owner (Rosie) needed our table. There were several other empty tables in the vicinity. Never have we been asked to give up our table at any restaurant. The only reason we were there that long was the slow service. Avoid this place at all costs. There are other better restaurants in the area. Don't give this woman a penny of your money. She obviously doesn't believe in superior customer service.
