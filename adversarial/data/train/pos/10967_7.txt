monarch.  I spend $400 a month on cannibis for my medical issues.  I pay a visit to monarch clean front office area staff overly and I mean overly friendly scripted greeting and service too funny.  I ask how many years you have been in business employee told me 5 years.\n\nI ask for the items to buy all items brought out to me on counter then I hand my visa card to extra extra nice employee he tells me we only except cash.  I thought to myself this place been open 5 years and no credit card transactions  hmmm.... employee then tells me there is an ATM machine behind me I asked how much is the fee he told me $2.50 I said thanks but no.\n\nAs I was leaving employee said have a nice day  I told him tell ownership to accept credit card transactions he said sorry about that I responded with not your fault just let folks know about this inconvenience.\n\nThe year is 2017 businesses need to get with the times and this place is a prime example of a silly money trap.  I did the math I spend approx. $4,000.00 per year on cannabis I will go to a more updated dispensary that accepts modern financial convenience for customers.
