Bought take away Spicy Salmon Rolls and Tempura Shrimp around midnight last night. Felt sick a few hours later. Definitely have food poisoning as of early this morning. Had to have been the takeout, because my fianc√©e and I are both sick. The only thing we shared all day was the takeout sushi. Will not chance eating here again.\n\nUPDATE: Was contacted by Toronto Public Health - they are currently investigating.\n\nUPDATE 2: This restaurant was given a Yellow rating (conditional pass) by TPH as of February 1, 2016 due to food handling and pest control measures concerns.
