There are ear plugs on the nightstand when you walk in. Say no more. \n\nOK, I'll say more. For the Aloft, some things were so right, but others were so wrong. A torn review here, for sure. A 3.5 if you will. Anyway, as mentioned in many other reviews, the staff is great. Friendly front desk help and a cool bartender upstairs. The rooms are pretty cool as well - big TV's, modern lighting, blackout shades, large bathroom, and nice little desk setup. The elephant in the room though... the outside noise. Being in a lively part of town is great, but you don't really want to take the party home with you and that's exactly what happens here. The music from the adjacent bars bleeds through the walls and windows with amazing acoustics. Not that hearing AC\/DC is a bad thing, but shut it down when I'm home at 1am and need to be up at 7am the next morning. To boot, my neighbor (a co-worker) asked me what I was watching bc she could hear me giggling through the wall. Yikes. These walls are like swiss cheese. \n\nOverall, not the worst place by a long shot, but do yourself a favor and ask for a quieter room (if that exists).\n\nBonus: a pool and gym
