Haha! This place is a joke. So lame it makes me laugh. Not only is the music whack, but the bouncers are clueless, pathetic white boys with no idea what a mockery they are. After getting bored and deciding to leave, we were waiting for our friends outside. The brain-dead bouncer thought he could tell us we couldn't stand on the sidewalk. Too bad it's a public space and he had to look stupid since we didn't move. Sorry suckers. Oh wait, not I'm not.
