If there was any way to give a rating of negative stars, this business would be negative 10!!  DO NOT go w\/ Dream Entertainment for any services!!!  I AM WARNING YOU!!\n\nI came across them at a bridal show.  Before we were leaving, I decided to fill out their little form....and that was the beginning of my nightmare and never ending rollercoaster.\n\nI received a call, claiming I won a $200 voucher from them.  My fault for believing this gimmick.  I should have known better.  But, I believe everyone and give them the benefit of the doubt.  Of course, I wasn't the only one that \"won\".  One of the girls I'm working with got the same call (who is also getting married)!!!  Scam!\n\nWe were convinced that they are nice people and will provide an amazing DJ, so we made a $400+ deposit.  After, I made that deposit...I had this sick feeling.  So, I went back to my office and looked up their reviews on weddingwire.com to see they had a 2.8 out of 5.0.  My fault for not researching this in advance.  The negative reviews were based on the poor customer service, and the DJ didn't go w\/ their playlist.  They played songs as they pleased.  I called an hour later, and spoke to the same lady that took my deposit, and asked her kindly to reverse the charge.  Her response, 'I have to ask the owner first'.  Ok...that was fine.  But, it took a whole month to get a hold of this owner.  He was always out of the office, sick or does not have cell phone coverage.  Of course, if it was the other way around (where someone needs the owner for a huge booking), the owner would be contacted immediately.  Finally, spoke to the owner and he kept convincing to go ahead w\/ the booking.  He claimed a lot of the reviews I saw were done by other DJ companies who were giving them a bad name.  After all the phone calls and emails back and forth, I was just tired of the BS and wanted my money back.  He said he will go ahead and refund my money (and I had a witness to this meeting), and I would have to meet w\/ him.  I scheduled a meeting w\/ him, and of course he didn't have the check.  Supposedly, the \"corporate\" office had to process the check.  Keep in mind, their office is located at a motel\/ cheap hotel.  It is located on the first floor, and use to be an old hotel room.  Yea, I'm sure they have a \"bigger\" corporate office.  Came back a week later, still no check.  Came back again, the \"corporate\" office still hasn't process it.  So, I handed them a small claims letter, and gave them a week and half to refund me the money.  No check.  So, we are in the process in filing the petition.  Also, reported them on BB.  We are not letting them get away w\/ this.\n\nJust wanted to let EVERYONE know what kind of people you would be dealing w\/ if you go w\/ this business.  If my $400 is a loss; I hope my review will give them a bigger loss.  They are friendly in the beginning of course, because all they want is your money.\n\nThe best decision I ever made was cancelling their service...because I would have hate to see the end result and have them ruin our wedding.
