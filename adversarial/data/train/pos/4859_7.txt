Nope. I have no idea why this place got such a high rating. You all must be used to subpar food. We went in for takeout and after they forgot to put our order in, we finally got our food. We both got dinner combo, one with beef and broccoli, and the other with shrimp. The fried rice that came with it had no flavor, nothing but rice,  just looks brown. The shrimp were tiny and tastelsss. Beef and brocolli was alright, nothing special. We didn't get any duck sauce at  all. Fried noodles were in a tiny bag and tasted like they were fried in old oil. Back in Charlotte, Ma Ma Wok rocked. Everything was always fresh and hot and flavorful. If you go here, you are SUM DUM FUK.
