Food tasted like it was old and super salty.  The teriyaki beef was super small for what you pay for.  The wonton was super thin and fell apart as I was trying to eat them!  The driver drove up to the house blasting gangster rap and blocked the neighbors driveway, preventing her from getting in.  Will not buy from again.  Many other choices in Lakewood.
