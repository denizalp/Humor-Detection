I'm a guy. I used to pay $8 for hair cuts or get them for free from a friend. Most cuts probably made me look like Lloyd Christmas.\nA few years ago I started to change the way I think about hair and started shelling out $25. I got a great cut and I kept going back.\nLast year I got a recomendation to see Jason at Salon 42 and because the person I used to go to was booked solid for month, I went.\n\nI pretty much told Jason that he came highly recomended so do whatever and if it sucked, my hair would grow back and I just wouldn't come back. However, Jason still took the challenge. He did an incredible job and I got more compliments than ever on my hair (something I never really pay attention to on other guys) from both men and women. One problem I have with my hair is that as it gets longer, it begins to curl at the edges. Also, while I have a full head of hair, the back grows more rapidly than the top and front (probably due to all that East TN water I used to drink). Whatever Jason does, he gives me a great cut the day of, but it now seems to grow much more even so now my entire head can have a party or be combed for business at the same time. I can choose!\n\nI have continued to go back every few months when the hair gets too shaggy and Jason not only remembers who I am but remembers what we last talked about. It makes it easy to have conversation and catch up while getting a top notch haircut.\n\nYou can tell this is not a job for Jason but an actual passion. He and his wife have been opening up other locations recently and it is easy to see why they are so successful.\nI've heard girls get a great style and cut there but speaking as a guy, I highly recomend it for men's cuts.
