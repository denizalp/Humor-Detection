Sephora came through in the clutch. \n\nI spent a good amount of time perusing Miracle Mile Shops for a last minute Christmas gift for my younger sister. I really had no idea what to get her...I'm a bad brother. I can't keep up with these things!\n\nAfter burning through an exorbitant amount of scent strips, I thought Ralph Eau de Toilette was a good choice. I know my sister appreciates a good perfume. Shouldn't we all?\n\nShe loved it, and I'm still brother #1.
