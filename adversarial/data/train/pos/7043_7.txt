It's kind of amazing when something that has 100% potential to be pretentious buffoonery overcomes the odds and makes what might have been a boring old lunch into something special.\n\nDo you like being fawned over? Mornay sauce? Two napkins and lots of large, heavy silverware? Expensive bottles of wine, names printed in script so that they're hard to read? You'll like it here.\n\nOddly, you'll also like it here if you like butter, really good bread, Veg-friendly Frenchish food and comfy chairs, and good deals. Because at 10 bucks for a sizable, rich entree complete with frites, a beverage, and a salad, it's one of the best lunchie deals in the area. The Ratatouille was standard but sat atop this incredible, creamy pillow of polenta. Hell yes. And the Croque, minus ham + tomato, was killer.\n\nFriend had mussels and wrastled with them a bit, but enjoyed. \n\nWhy, oh why, were the fries so cold and soggy? Close, George, but no cigar.
