Gorgeous building, convenient parking, and they give back to the local community!\nCame here for a performance and then again for a work-related training: in addition to the regular performance hall, there are other buildings with smaller rooms for more intimate musical performances as well as meeting space.\n\nI really appreciate how the parking garage is right next to the museum, which is right around the corner from the performance hall. Signage and maps are everywhere, and the staff I found nearby were friendly and helpful when I couldn't figure out which entrance to use due to construction.
