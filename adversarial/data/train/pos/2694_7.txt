PAI is Chef Nuit's latest venture and we were excited to sample the menu for their soft opening.  The menu has our all time favourites, Squash Fritters, Red Flame Morning Glory, Pad Thai and, of course, Khoa Soi.  The new items include, Moo Ping [Northern Thai sweet grilled pork on skewer], Gaeng Hunglay [pork belly curry with ginger and roasted peanut].  \n\nEverything was delicious, like a home cooked meal in Northern Thailand.  Chef Nuit has high standards for her food and this new restaurant is no exception.
