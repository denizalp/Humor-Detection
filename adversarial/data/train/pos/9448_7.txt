I am sitting in Cefiore right now. Right now, and I am writing about it because they have free wifi so I don't even have to pretend I am doing work, I can blatantly not do work and tell you how content I am right now.\n\nI lived in New York last summer when the froyo craze hit the east coast and I wasn't into it. I'm still not, but whatever, I just ate a burrito and wanted something sweet. Plus I live down the street from here and must have passed it about a thousand times. Cefiore totally hits the spot.\n\nWhy do I like it? Because the place is comfortable, mod, and has a wicked deal for three toppings for 43Â¢ each. And the fruit selections are great - I got pomegranate seeds with blueberries and raspberries. That is major points in the antioxidants section and after being exiled from the Middle East for a few years, I am ALWAYS happy to eat pomegranate seeds (and not look like I committed bloody murder by scooping the seeds out myself).\n\nThere are a few flavours on tap - original, green tea, raspberry and pomegranate, and chocolate - and about sixteen or so toppings. The original yogurt isn't too sour nor too sweet, it's just right. They have smoothies and other beverages and nice staff. It smells like waffles in here.\n\nAt the end of November, a healthy and sweet something is greatly appreciated.
