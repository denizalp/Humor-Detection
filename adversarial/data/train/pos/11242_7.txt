I generally do not like shaved ice and I think the name of this place is weird!  That being said, Im a big fan!  This is the answer to a boring snow cone!\n\nIts in a little trailer at the Aliante park, walking distance from my house!  They tout their homemade flavored syrups and I think their efforts are well worth it!  \n\nThey had a bunch of flavors, I went with pineapple with coconut lather!  It had the pineapple flavor, with condensed milk, vanilla ice cream, and a nice thick rich coconut cream on top!  Topped with a strawberry and toasted coconut!\n\nThe pineapple flavor could have been stronger, but other than that this place changed my mind on shaved ice!  \n\n(yes, I used an exclamation on the end of each sentence)
