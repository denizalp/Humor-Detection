This place has great food, class and style.... Unfortunately everybody in town knows it. If you're going on the weekend for a dinner, expect long waits.\n\nThe plus side of waiting is that you can grab drinks down the street at The Saint tavern while you wait.\n\nSeriously, any place that spends the cash to import a wood oven from Italy, brick by goddamn brick, is going to have amazing pizza. This may go without saying but if you're going, order a pizza. Don't be a f-idiot and get salad or some other nonsense. You don't make friends with salad!
