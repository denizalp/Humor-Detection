If you're at this resort and have no means of getting into town, this isn't all that bad. Service is good and food is well prepared, but with all the other options in Scottsdale, why settle? There was actually a live Jazz singer in the lounge who was quite good, so, overall, I had a positive experience here.\n\nOne thing this place is great for is group dinners. We had a fairly small group of 6, but saw others with 10-12 in their parties sitting around long tables to accommodate.
