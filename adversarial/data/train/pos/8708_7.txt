This is honestly the Best Pho soup in Arizona and I have been nearly everywhere! Thai food and Pho soup are my 2 favorite things to eat becides salads and veggies! \nPho Thanh has big giant boals of mouth watering pho soup with amazing broth that will make your nose run (after you load it with all your fresh herbs) and your heart warm. They are not the friendliest people there, but I don't care, the Pho soup is freakin amazing and that's ALL I care about. I truly have not been to a Japanese restaurant that gives you good service anyway, so I would never review on their service. Just try the Pho soup here, it's totally worth the drive no matter where you are coming from. Also, the egg rolls are awesome too, not the spring rolls, the egg rolls. I'm not downing the spring rolls, I just haven't ordered them so I can't give an opinion either way on those. Thanks and have a Happy Day!\nFay
