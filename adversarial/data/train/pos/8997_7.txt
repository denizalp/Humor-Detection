I don't know how people in Vegas can call this nasty shit \"food\". Seriously, are all of your taste buds dead and everything tastes like cardboard? \n\nWish I could give a negative rating, because not only is there bad food, but they put religious tracts on their cups. (At least they did last time I was there.) \n\nDisgusting. Save your money and go to Fatburger or Grind.
