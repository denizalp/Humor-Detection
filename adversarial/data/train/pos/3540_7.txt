My friend was really happy to take me to this new place. I thought the place was super cute. We had to wait about 30 minutes for a table, the staff was polite and we finally got a table. HOWEVER, when I saw the menu, for my sadness, disappointment and complete disgust this place serves Foie Grass!!! I just couldn't believe a cute place would be so cruel.\nI wanted to leave the place, write the menu, talk to the manager... but because of my friend i stayed - yes, I am disappointed with myself too. I ordered the veggie eggs benefit (or something like that) it was delicious! I just can't understand why they would serve Foie grass when they can make delicious veggie dishes.  I will never go back there! Unless they change their menu. This place makes me wanna cry.\n\nI am vegan now. I regret eating the egg.
