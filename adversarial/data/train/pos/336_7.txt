Luxurious Place!\nLocated inside The Cosmopolitan and consists of 4 floors. \n\nWhen we went some floors were reserved for events and so we went to the first floor since it was open to the public.\n\nBartender was busy so it took about 10 mins for him to take our order. Since I read reviews about this place beforehand I decided to get The Verbena since it sounded interesting.\n\nBartender gave us instruction on how to drink it. You sip the drink first. Then bite and chew the flower which temporarily numbs your mouth then you keep drinking your drink.\n\nDrinks are pricey here, The Verbena was $18\n\nVerbena was very tasty. When it numbed my point in my opinion it made the alcohol taste stronger. After the numbness went away the drink tasted very sweet with a slight taste of alcohol. Very delicious.
