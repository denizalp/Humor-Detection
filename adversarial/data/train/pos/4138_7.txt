For all the years I've been staying mid-strip, my biggest complaint was a lack of a good convenience shop walking distance to the casinos.  Well, my complaints have been answered. Not just a convenience shop, but a drug store with extras.  Right next door to the Venetian and Casino Royale and a short hop and skip from the Mirage and Harrah's is this place.  A Denny's use to reside here, but they moved it upstairs and replaced it with Walgrens.  You can get cold drinks, bottled water, drugs, some grocery and even food here.  Plus it's 24\/7 baby!  Of course, you pay higher than a grocery store or a pharmacy off the strip, but that is the price you pay for such a convenience.
