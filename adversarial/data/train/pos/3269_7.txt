Food was great. Nothing less than expected in terms of taste from Red Lobster. I got the Shrimp Linguine Pasta and my husband got the Fried Catfish and Broccoli. All was very tasty. I was a little disappointed in the size of the full dinner portion.  It was maybe half of a to-go container which I thought was small.  However,  I can be greedy so I was slightly biased.  \n\nCustomer service was a 3.5, definitely could have been better initially. So,  I tried to call ahead my order and the front picked up but the next dept. (In assuming bar area) hung up the phone.  First strike!  Second, when I got to the bar area inside to place my order, I waited over 5 min and then had to ask someone to get someone to come to the bar area to take orders. Second strike! Lastly, which I look at as a \"ball\" and\/or pass once my order was taken the bartender did offer me something to drink while waiting and I got extra cheese biscuits. Other than that no other service.  \n\nWould I go back, probably mainly because I love the Linguini Pasta and Red Lobster cheddar biscuits.
