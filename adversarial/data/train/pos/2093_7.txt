so a girl i know works here and after a discussion in mexico about why i don't like fox concepts, she convinced me to come and give it a try. \n\nso she sent me a message the following week telling me she was working the lunch shift and i headed in. \n\nshe was so sweet and brought us a free pretzel app. my lunch date and i were both trying to eat healthy but felt bad not eating it. so what were we to do? \n\nwrap the pretzels in a napkin, shove them in my purse, and feed them to the guys at work of course! \n\nour food came out and it was pretty decent. the price was fair and of course you can expect it to be darling bc that's what fox does best. \n\ni'd be willing to go back! the service was friendly from all the staff, not just my friend :) \n\na- ok!
