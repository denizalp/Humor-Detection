I'm the girl who goes to a steakhouse and orders salmon. Go ahead, throw rocks at me. \n\nOkay, so not every time. I love a good steak, but for some reason the chili glazed goodness was calling my name last week. A group of six friends came here to celebrate a birthday. Before I get to the food, I have to talk about the special touches they did for the birthday. They made us personalized menus that said Happy Birthday Jason at the top. Our server also took a group pic of the table and made a special card with it. Great stuff. \n\nAnd now to the feast. We ordered for the table jumbo shrimp Alexander and from the specials menu: crab stuffed mushrooms and bacon steak. How could we not order something called bacon steak?! Spoiler alert: worth every calorie. We also got some lobster bisque and wedge salads. The wedge was massive. The clear steak winner for the table was the Chicago Style Prime Bone-In Ribeye. I wanted it, but knew there was no way possible I could finish it. Andrea and Jason split one. Great idea and I highly recommend. Back to my salmon, I thought it was delicious. The succotash type goodness under it was also really good. We ordered a bunch of sides to split. My winner was the horseradish mashed potatoes. Warning: they pack a punch. I also got a boozy coffee drink for my post-dinner dessert. It was good, but I was way too full by that point to completely enjoy it. \n\nOur server was fantastic. She took a lot of time to explain the menu and go over options. She was also really honest with her answers, which I completely appreciate. She didn't BS or lie. The manager also came over to check in on us and see how the evening was going.\n\nNow Morton's is not something that works with my budget as a frequent stop, but it is a nice option as a special occasion place. The bar is also a great place to hang out for a drink or a bite. My friend Kevin swears by the burger.
