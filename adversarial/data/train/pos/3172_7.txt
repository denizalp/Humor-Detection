Yoli's is easily in my top favorite breakfast restaurants. I usually go with my gf Saturday or Sunday mornings and get the mix and match. You can pick from several items and I usually get the standard egg, sausage, has browns with one pancake. And, this pancake is just about perfect. It's big, fluffy and cooked to a light and slightly crispy golden brown. You don't even have to use syrup. Recently, I tried the Morning Monte which I am definitely getting next time. The flavor is exquisite. Just about everything on the menu is worth ordering.\n\nThe restaurant is tucked away in a garden oasis in downtown Chandler. We wouldn't have found it except for all the popular Yelp reviews. They have a good amount of outdoor seating nearby a quaint arrangement of flowers, plants and birdcages that house several exotic and colorful birds. It's worth going just to check out those lil guys. \n\nThe only downside is that the kitchen is small, so when the brunch rush hits, it can take a while. But Yoli and her staff are so friendly and pretty honest about the wait. We grab coffee and sit it out. Trust me, it's worth it!
