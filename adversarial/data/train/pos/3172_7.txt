Since moving to the area, I've only found a few places to eat around Forest Hills that I really like. Drew's Family Restaurant being one of the few. YAY!\n\nI'm only going to review the breakfast because I've never eaten here for lunch or dinner. Drew's has become a Saturday morning staple! The breakfast sampler is classic and happens to be one of my favorites! French toast is made perfectly!\n\nNothing fancy, so don't expect it because it's not that kind of place... just really GREAT food, clean place, and great service!!\n\nShout out to Cheryl! You're the best!
