This is one of those places - it's been there forever, it doesn't need your approval or your patronage, it will outlive us all, the end. \n\nWe were on our way to the Pirates game and our locals told us it was the thing to do so, even though we were still full from a late lunch, we went there, got some beers, way too many fried oysters, and got the hell out of the way when the check was settled. \n\nIf you actually are going expecting to enjoy the food - be aware that an order of three lightly seasoned breaded oysters is the equivalent of three White Castle burger-sized oysters (cause they've been pounded flat) smothered in about half a cannister of 4C breadcrumbs and then fried. I think \"stick to your ribs\" is an adequate way to describe the sensation I was wrestling with on my way across the Roberto Clemente Bridge. \n\nIt's also one of those places where if you're trying to eat healthy and you order the salad, you get a styrofoam plate with iceberg and a couple anemic slices of tomato on top. \n\nAlso, I recall there being some sort of a deal where, if you join the birthday club, you get a Rocky Marciano poster on your big day.\n\nSo yeah, I'll totally be back!
