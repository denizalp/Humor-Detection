My friends and I stayed at the MGM Grand two weeks ago, and it was not as great as I expected. It was average, nothing extravagant. For $210 per night, I expected more than average.  \n\nUpon entering, my friends and I had to walk a great deal. Checking in and out was a long process. Even though it wasn't crowded, it took a long time. The lobby area is huge, spacious, and has nice decor. In fact, you can practically get lost. The staff was kind and courteous. Housekeeping was so prompt and always available daily ... a bit too available. Sometimes they just knock once, and as I go to open the door, they already let themselves in ... which I'm not a big fan of. Next, the rooms were not as spacious as I expected, just average. It's a bit small, and plain. However, some perks are ... the pool is gorgeous, and is an also great place to relax. You get a 15% discount to shows and spa services. And the shuttle ($6 per person) is located right outside of the hotel, and can take you straight to the McCarren International Airport. \n\nOverall, I'd give the hotel three stars. It was a nice experience staying at the MGM Grand. But next time, I rather stay at The Mirage or Mandalay Bay.
