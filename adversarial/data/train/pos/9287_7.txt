I hated my experience here! Normally, I would go to Qua at Ceasars but since we were staying at TheHotel, thought I'd give it a try. \n\nHad a TheHotel facial with Jennifer. She was not gentle at all. A few times I actually said \"ouch\" but she just ignored me. When she did the extractions, I literally felt she was gauging me with a knife. It was that painful. Hate this place. Spa itself is dark and gloomy. Felt like being in a cave! For $150 facial, just skip it. I'd rather pay $200 at Qua.  To this day, a week later , my face is still breaking out. It's so crazy.  I take very good care of my face and have never had problems with my skin after a high end facial. Hey, Bathhouse: dump the yogurt exfoliator ; it burns and stings!! No wonder your spa is empty on a holiday weekend! Just horrible.
