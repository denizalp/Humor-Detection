Very sketchy dive bar with lots of streetwalkers and toothless bitches. You can tell the clientele is very low class, because it's the only bar I've ever been to in Vegas that had 5 CENT video poker. First and only time I was there, 2 black dudes came in carrying paper bags... i was sure that they we gonna hold the place up and kill everyone. \n\nBTW- the only reason that this place is a restaurant is because they have a hot-dog stand out front.\n\nAvoid this shithole at all costs. They should send a hazmat team over there to sterilize the place.
