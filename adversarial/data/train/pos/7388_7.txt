Am I the only person in this whole wide world that thinks Kohl's is very expensive? I dont like all the constant sales tricks either, 10% off 1 day, 15%percent off the next 20% if theres a full moon, 25% if youre on your period,30% off if you are a fire sign. 50% if you are using a Kohl's charge credit card w. an amazing 26% interest. Hate it
