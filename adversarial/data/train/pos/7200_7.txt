HORRIBLE service this time around!!!\nand it was by Marcus Schultheis \"Store Manager\" and \"Area Manager\"??? really???\nZERO customer service skills.\n\nI had purchased items there on 5\/2013 with a salesman named Moon, I had a great experience so when I had more mattress needs I went there. I was told he was at another store.\nI asked if he could help me but he was busy with another customer and took my name and number and would call me back.\nThe evening passed...\nNext day I was driving by the store at 4:30pm and decided to stop by.\n\"Marcus\" acknowledged he took the call with no aplologies for not returning call.\nI asked about what I needed and he pointed it out. At that time another customer he had been working with walked in but clearly had not been \"hooked\" yet and left me standing there without finishing up with me.\n\nI left store.
