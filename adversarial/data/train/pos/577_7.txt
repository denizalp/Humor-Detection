If it weren't for the fact I usually walk out of here with money, I would give this casino 2 stars.  I only come here when my mom is visiting.  She likes this location because she usually wins.  I usually lose.  However, my stepfather hates it that she wants to play, so my mom gives me money to gamble with her.  I usually lose, but she shares her winnings with me anyway.  Those are good odds in my favor.\n\nThe casino itself is like a big tent.  They are building what I think is a hotel.  It should be a medical center.  An hour here and you could probably see the black spots on your lungs start to appear.  The smoke is that bad.  And then I always get stuck next to some rude a-hole that holds their cancer stick away from themselves, and waves it in my personal space.  I don't mind there is smoking in the casino, but a little courtesy might be nice.\n\nAnyway, the slots do seem to be loose at times.  And I did win $450 Sunday night-yeah me!  The only thing I have ever won here, and the most I ever have won.  This casino does not offer much entertainment besides giving your money away, however.
