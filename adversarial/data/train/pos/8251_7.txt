I'm usually not the type for booshe clubs but this time around I had a great time.  For a friend's bday, we got bottle service at the indoor portion of the club (i must add it was in a prime location).   The waitresses and host were real nice and pretty.  I even came across some of the old bouncers i knew from Prive (btw, Prive was my shit, don't care what the yelp reviwers say, most people don't know how to club it up in vegas anyways...GET BOTTLE SERVICE!!)\n\nAnyways i digress...If you're a girl, you probably just wanna get in the club for a small fee or wut not and try to get the idiots there to get you gals drinks...more power to you!...me n friends fortunately enough like to do it big in vegas and this table service at Surrender definately is on my top 3 of service.  Number one rule in vegas, take care of everyone...and money talks...don't get me wrong, i'm not a rich guy, but if you're going to vegas in a budget and plan to go clubbin...you might as well stay in your hometown and find a club there...YOU'RE IN VEGAS...GO BIG OR GO HOME\n\nanyways i digress once again...the women are beautiful...typical vegas prices on drinks....not as booshe as XS.  The music was blah...but the setting and enviorment defiantely made up for it.  If you like all that rap mixed with trance music then you'll LOVE this place.  \nI actually rolled to this place with some ghetto folks and they had a very teeny amount of hip hop (snoop and dre)....from wut i heard through the grape vine...Vegas clubs are trying to be more Jersey Shorish rather than hip hop dancing (which is going to actract booshe ass jersey shorish people haha....note: I'm not hatin on the jersey shore)....\n\nDefiantely check this place out...get bottle service here....if you can't afford it, don't come, if you wanna come but can't afford it, then save and plan accordingly.
