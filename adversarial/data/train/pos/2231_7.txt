What a fantastic idea for a restaurant.  You cook your own shit on a hot ass stone.  Just be careful not to burn your face off as you lay your head down to take a nap after a nice juicy steak.  The sauces they have to compliment your juicy meat are really good and the service was fantastic.\n\nI wonder if I could bring one of these to wrigleyville.  Imagine 400 drunk cubs fans with third degree burns to their face.
