I've always been a fan of Terroni.\n\nHaving dined at the three locations in Toronto, I would have to say this one is one of their more beautiful locations. Their upstairs patio is amazing and is the perfect stop for summer. With plenty of light, room, and wine, Terroni is a great place to go with friends, family or just to stock up on some pepperoncini. \n\nWould highly recommend trying their specials, they never seem to disappoint.
