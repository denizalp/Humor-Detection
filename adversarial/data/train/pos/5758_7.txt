Do you like Rocky Point? I do, and that is why this restaurant is like a brother to me, a weird, some-what attractive step-brother:)\nThe facade may appear shady, but let's be honest, shady is good. Good food, this place is very authentic, and good prices, I am never upset.\nI have been to this restaurant many times for lunch. I like coming there because there are usually only a handful of customers and I can enjoy a lot of waitress attention. \nYou are greeted with a free cup of seafood soup that is so yummy and full of chunks of seafood. Aye papi!\nDid I mention that the seafood here is phenominal! They have this appetizer called oysters el pacifico that is moi bueno! It is oysters on the half shell with shrimp, avocado and red onions, very delicious. The restaurant is run by the whole family, papa is the chef, the daughter is the notary\/manager and the son (Jr.) is the renaissance man. You are always treated like family in here.\nWARNING: The service is slow so if you are not going to enjoy food, culture and company, please do not go.
