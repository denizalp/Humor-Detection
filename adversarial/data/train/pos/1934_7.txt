This was my second time dining at Company. And unfortunately, it will probably be the last. Maybe that's not fair. I'll explain.\n\nI first dined at Company back in June. My party of six was seated by a waiter and looked after very attentively by three support servers clad all black pants, collared shirts and aprons. I felt a little under-dressed. The menu was upscale comfort food. My friend Katie gave me part of her delicious lobster BLT. My friend Colton gave me two spoonfuls of deliciously creamy mashed potatoes and the best creamed spinach I have ever had. I had the special that night, which was the jambalaya. It was fantastic. And there was so much of it, I couldn't even finish it all. Overall, I had a great experience and vowed to return.\n\nOver Thanksgiving weekend, I found out that a friend and I  would be staying at the Luxor for the Criss Angel show Believe (see that review before you go). I quickly made reservations for Company. I couldn't wait to show off this place that I \"knew\". And I wore a jacket and nice shoes this time too. \n\nThe restaurant looked exactly the same as it did in June. Only now the waiters were clad in black t-shirts that had the word \"Company\" silkscreened across them. The very friendly waiter asked if I had dined here before. I proudly told him \"Yes. Last June.\" To which he said \"Oh. So you were here before our concept change.\" Concept change? Uh boy. He continued his rotely memorized patter \"What our concept is now is that we take classic Western dishes and we combine them with Eastern ingredients to deliver small tasting plates with great variety.\" My heart and stomach sank. \"So this is like an East\/West tapas menu? Right?\" To which he said \"I'm glad you said that. That's a very good way of describing it.\" I checked in with my friend. It wasn't a deal breaker for him. So we soldiered on.\n\nThe menu is divided into four sections: Sea, Sky, Land and Earth. We both ordered an item from each category.\n\nSEA: Seared Tuna w\/ lemon, olive oil, wasabi greens - There was so little of this dish, I barely remember it.\nLumb Crab Gratin w\/shitake mushroom, bacon, leek and cotija cheese- This was really good. I'd like another portion of this. And to top it off, it was served in the same cast iron gratin dish that they used to serve the creamed spinach in. WHERE ARE YOU CREAMED SPINACH?\n\nSKY: Organic Duck Confit Potstickers- They were okay. I've never understood why you would hide duck confit in a potsticker that you are going to dip in a sauce.\nChicken Breast w\/mushroom ragout- The Eleanor Rigby  of this menu\n\nLAND: SoHo Kobe Beef Slider- Very good. But their current prevalence on so many gastropub menus didn't make me feel like it was anything terribly special. \nFilet of Beef w\/brandy cream and melted leek- Good. Not really sure what a melted leek is though, either before or after I ate it.\n\nEARTH: Gruyere Cheese Puffs w\/chive creme fraiche and lobster oil- On the dry side. This was the one dish that remained the longest on the table due to neither of us fighting over it.\nChili Garlic Asparagus- Really good. Strands of baby asparagus. Glad it came out with the steak too.\n\nOverall, it was good food. After finishing all of the entrees, the waiter asked if we were still hungry. I answered with a qualified YES. He offered to bring the menu back. But I was thinking more about walking across the street to the Dan Marino Steakhouse at Hooters. Now THERE'S fine dining ;-). I capped off the meal with a dessert of Earl Grey chocolate cake with almond ice cream. SOOOOOO TINY. \n\nI guess I'd go to Company again. But I'd only bring a certain group of people with me. Their concept change has radically changed my concept of dining there. Good place for foodies to knock off a bunch of plates. Bad place for someone who hasn't eaten since the Chick-Fil-A four hours away in Upland, California.
