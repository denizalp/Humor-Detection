Came here with my wife for Valentine's dinner and got the same fun quirky service I've come to love at Buca. Our server Kenny was very humorous and really made the experience. Kudos to him!\n\nWe ordered the heart-shaped lasagna with a side meatball (cuz cmon, how can you go to Buca and NOT order one of those gigantic awesome meatballs!?). The lasagna seemed even more delicious than their typical rendition which is hard to do! The meatball was juicy and cooked to perfection. We also ordered the strawberry Italian soda with cream which I super recommend if you're not sure what to order for a drink.\n\nNow, we were of course waaaay too stuffed to order dessert, but I'm gonna put my little plug here about that humongous sundae they have. It is nothing short of phenomenal. I must warn you however that you'll need at least four people to finish that thing unless you're Adam Richman (we were in a party of four). This is obviously an item you can't take home, unless you like vanilla brownie soup.\n\nIf you are dying for some great quality Italian food, look no further than Buca di Beppo!
