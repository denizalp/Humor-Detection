I asked my kids what they wanted for dinner. Well what do you know they wanted pizza. Shocking news. \n\nWell, it just so happens that Metro Pizza just happens to be in the same plaza we were in so off we go.\n\nAs soon as we come in to what appears to be a full house, we are greeted warmly by the host and showed us to our table. Right away our server hands us menus and gets our drink orders. Great first impression so far.\n\nWe order the Domenica Salad, Garlic Romano Fries, and a large thin crust half Pepperoni half Gotham. \n\nThe Domenica Salad has romaine lettuce, salami, ham, provolone, cucumbers, onions and tomatoes all tossed in their own house dressing and served with a fresh-baked garlic knot.\n\nThe Garlic Romano Fries has shredded romano cheese and real saut√©ed minced garlic. No vampires will attack you after eating this.\n\nAnd for the star of the show, a large thin crust half Pepperoni half Gotham pizza. On one half you got just about every topping they have and on the other half just your basic pepperoni. The crust itself seemed like it was hand tossed at first sight, but as soon as you take that first wonderful crispy bite, there is no mistaking it is genuinely thin crust. With thin crust, usually a lot of toppings tend to make it limp. Not this style, the overall slice kept its shape. \n\nAs for the service, lets put it this way, if you don't have to ask for anything, that means everything was on point. This was one tip I didnt mind going over the standard. Great service is few and far in between it seems so I dont mind showing my gratitude.\n\nSo there you have it. Great food and great service. Finding both in everywhere you eat is usually a low percentage. If I am in the area, I will ask my kids.........no what I meant was I will tell my kids we are having pizza.
