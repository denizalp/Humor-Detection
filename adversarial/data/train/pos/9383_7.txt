A really enjoyable and authentic Korean Fried Chicken experience at Mymy Chicken. \n\nAll you really need to order is Fried Chicken and I was not disappointed!\n\n4 of us shared:\n\nFire Hot Chicken ($28)\nHalf and Half ($28) : Original and Gold Cheese\n\nWarning the Fire Hot is HOT and SPICY! And I just love how light the batter is and the meat just so moist! My lips though were burning! Deep fried rice cakes that came with the order tasted so good with the hot sauce! \n\nProbably one of favourite KFC joints in town. They ordered their custom fryers and ingredients from Korean. This is probably as close to eating fried chicken in Korea without flying there.\n\nToo bad there are no smaller order for single diner, if not I would be there more often to indulge myself. But for the time being, I guess I have to invite my friends to share.
