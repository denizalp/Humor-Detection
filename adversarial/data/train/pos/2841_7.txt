I love this particular Shake Shack especially because it's the only one I've been to without having to stand in line for an excessive amount of time for a burger. But they're so famous I was willing to stand in line for an hour in New York City to try it and then again when one opened on the Vegas strip. Now, no line at Downtown Summerlin for the best burger in my humble opinion (yes even better than In n Out, Five Guys, Smash and FatBurger)...and you pay for that extra dose of gourmet but it's worth every meaty bite  And now they have a chicken sandwich that was so good it will now substitute Chick-fil-A for me until one opens in Vegas. And I'm obsessed with Chick-fil-A. But on second thought it's all the way in Henderson so I may just convert to Shake Shack chicken. The crew at this location were nice and didn't judge me when I had a beer for lunch, cause why not, I work in morning radio, noon is my happy hour.
