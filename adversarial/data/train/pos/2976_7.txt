When I first reviewed this huge aquatic attraction, I had yet to have my kiddo. Until you've seen the shark tunnel, the touch tanks, the glowing jelly fish and feeding of the rays through the eyes of a child, you have no idea just how special this place is. \n\nIf you don't have kids, I recommend going on a weekday to avoid the crowds of tiny people running around. If you do have kids, just lean into the chaos and enjoy the ride. The moving floor ride, that is.
