Call me conservative.  Call me reserved.  Call me a prude, even.  I don't have sex on the first date, I don't \"friend\" people I haven't met, and I don't give out five stars on my first visit to a restaurant.  Part of a five star rating is consistency, in my opinion.\n\nThat being said, I really enjoyed my first visit to PM a couple of weeks ago and couldn't wait to come back.  I didn't want to besmirch this place with a four star rating. I knew that I was going to bestow the coveted five star rating before I even arrived for my second meal at this cute restaurant.\n\nI've been to France several times and know the real deal.  Scanning the menu I was heartened to see so many of the classics.  Some people have been dismayed by what they claim is a limited menu.  I think there are plenty of great choices here.  In fact, this is the rare menu where I literally want to try every item!\n\nThe first visit we had the escargot, salmon and pork dishes.  All were delicious.  I would slightly prefer the escargot in the shell (think Pretty Woman) rather than en croute but that is a minor issue.\n\nThis last visit we ordered entirely different selections and they were all great.  The mussels in white wine broth were yummy, the Thai snapper was moist and flavorful, and my braised veal cheeks were rich and delicious.  Paired with the meal was a delightful French pinot noir reasonably priced at $40 a bottle.\n\nFor dessert we had the vanilla souffle with grand marnier creme anglaise.\n\nThe service was great and the outside patio was very nice.  I think when two people are dining, the side patio is a little more intimate than the front patio.   The french music is a nice touch.\n\nWhat a wonderful restaurant.
