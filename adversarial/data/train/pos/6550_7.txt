Sweet baby jesus my A\/C was on the fritz today.  I was taking my afternoon nap when I got a text from my roommate, who was coincidently napping in the room next door, telling me that he thought the AC was failing us.  I groggily stumbled out of my cave to find that yes, the thermostat was rapidly surpassing 80.... \n\nCalled the A\/C guy who couldnt come for another 2 hours or so, so I pulled on some pants and raced down to Lowe's.  \n\nI frantically flew into the store and was surprisingly greeted by someone who actually knew where the AC filters were.  Since mine hadnt been changed in a good 6 months or so (what??  I'm a girl I dont know these useless things), I figured a new filter was the place to start.  I found the filter right where the greeter said it would be, and raced to the checkout.\n\nNo line!  NO LINE!!!  And someone actually pleasant to help me.  What is this place called?!  NOT Home Depot, thats for sure!  The check out guy, Sam, reassured me that AC was actually pretty easily fixed and that it probably just needed freeon (frion? free-on? frie-ohn?) but that yes, I had picked out a great set of filters.  Why thank you Sam!!\n\nI left having one of the best experiences of my hardware store shopping career.  And yes, now my AC is fixed.  Back to being pantsless.
