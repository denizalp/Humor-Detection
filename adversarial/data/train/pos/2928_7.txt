My expectations were definitely exceeded here.  After attempting to find a good lunch spot in the area for about 15 minutes (so many on Yelp have closed!) my coworker and I settled in on SteakenBurger.  \n\nFirst off, the place is huge.  I really liked the picnic table style seating, and the fact that they have a few flat screen TV's rocking ESPN - definitely a huge plus.  The prices were really, REALLY reasonable, and you can expect to pay between $3-4 for a good sized burger \/ sandwich.\n\nOn to the food.  I ordered the buffalo chicken sandwich and my coworker ordered the Hellzapoppin' burger without giving it much thought other than the fact that it would be spicy.  The buffalo chicken was great, they give you your choice of about 10 different wing sauces for it - honey hot is great.  The sandwich is huge, and the 'small' fries that came with the combo were more than enough (and delicious).\n\nWatching my compadre eat his Hellzapoppin' burger was hilarious.  This burger comes with jalape√±os, pepper jack cheese, cayenne pepper, and to top it all off - habanero sauce.  Two bites in and his face was as red as a tomato; four bites in and he was literally sweating.  Hilarious! (For me.)\n\nOne other thing to note is that they have happy hour here; although it would be kind of weird rocking pitchers of Bud Lite in a fast-food type environment.  The prices are good, with pitchers running you $6.  If I get any more broke I'll be tempted to give it a shot.
