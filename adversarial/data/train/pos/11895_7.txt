By far the best Poke place in Phoenix and only rivaled by its sister store in North Scottsdale. No one has fish as fresh and just like their other location, this place is immaculate and the staff is incredible. They do not have the Hawaiian Snow Ice at this location which I really like nor do they have hard alcohol but I'm told they're getting beer wine and sake soon. Either way, if you want the best Poke in AZ this is your place. Honestly, no other Poke in town compares and those who say otherwise simply don't know any better.
