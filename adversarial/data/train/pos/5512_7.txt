I have a soft spot for manwiches made of generous helping of slow cooked meat and a slathering of thick molasses like sauce.  \n\nBlack Camel keeps it simple. Only one type of bun is available to be stuffed with your choice of beef brisket (most popular choice), steak, pancetta, pulled chicken or pulled pork. \n\nThe place is tiny, and considering it is, during brunch anyway, packed with a mini line, seating inside is limited and not very comfortable. There is a patio set available outside or you can grab your sandwich and eat it at Ramsden Park. \n\nThe prices range between $7-9, with toppings and sauces sold for extra. The sandwiches are deceptively large and incredibly filling. A degree in civil engineering may help with eating them properly! \n\nIf you become a fan, grab yourself a stamp card and join their loyalty program. Every 12th sandwich is free! If you happen to be in the area pre-brunch, check them out for breakfast. They make their eggs with an espresso machine!
