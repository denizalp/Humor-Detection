I feel so much angst and irritation when leaving here.. not sure why I even bother. They TOTALLY screw you on your game trades.. their retail prices are FULL RETAIL.. so their prices suck.. the kids behind the counter are generally douche bags. However, what am I going to do with the games I don't play anymore? Let them become clutter around here.. oh hell no! They'll all go to Game Stop so I can have something to complain about! OMG, I sound like my mother!
