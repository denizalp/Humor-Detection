That's right, it is woohoo as good as it gets!\n\nThis place is perfect for a celebration dinner with some special people.  After it was over, I wanted to bring everyone I love here to have a great experience - it's that freaking good!\n\nThe food was excellent.  The table shared some mozzarella & prosciutto and caprese.  I had the scialatielli alle vongole, the handmade pasta was out of this world delicious and top it off with amazing clams *drool*.  Oh, I can't forget the wine, the wine was actually the best part believe it or not, I can't recall all the names because like I said, it was a celebration dinner, but one stuck out \"CUM LAUDE\" haha, it still makes me giggle.\n\nThe service was also excellent, that coupled with the romantic decor and ambiance make this a 5 star dinning establishment, well, in my opinion anyway.
