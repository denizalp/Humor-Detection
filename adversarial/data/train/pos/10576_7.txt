drove from California to vegas to find a repair shop to fix my nephews truck while searching on YELP  i came across( Don DI)  don't let the looks of the place scare you !\nLuis the manager s AWESOME ! from the moment we spoke i felt completely comfortable  and trusting , they even went beyond my repair and helped me out just because they were working in the general area ...to all the people from CA who find themselves in need of auto repair when visiting vegas , GO  and see the Fella's from DON's DI SERVICES  .... trust the sign fair price !!! and that is the TRUTH! thanks guys
