All you can eat sushi lunch for about $20. I had so much sushi. They have good sushis, one of my favourite AYCE sushi bars in Montr√©al. They have a wide range of sushi choices. They restaurant is spacious and looks very elegant. I was pleasantly surprised at how good the restaurant looks. I will definitively come here again.
