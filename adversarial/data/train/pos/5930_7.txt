My friends and I were very excited to try this place and surprises that on opentable, we were able to make a lunch reservation the day of! \nWe ordered the soup of the day (cream of potato) and onion soup to start off with. I loved the cream of potato soup!! If you want something creamy and savory, I definitely recommend it! I also enjoyed the onion soup, but I was not a huge fan of the baked cheese on top. \nI ordered the eggs Benedict which came with Canadian bacon and a side of hash browns. I found the hash brown to be really cold when it came out, and the English muffin was extremely hard- I couldn't cut it so I just ended up eating the top part. It was just too burnt. \nMy friends orders were delicious though! Especially the chicken sandwich- I will definitely order that if I were to come here again! It also comes with a side of fries, which were crispy and perfectly seasoned. \nI also tried the grilled cheese and mushroom and chicken crepe. They were delicious and perfectly cooked.\nOne downside is that after placing our order, we decided we wanted to try the fries and ordered it from our waiter. He failed to mention that the two of our dishes came with fries and we had no idea, so we had 3 fries for 4 people and it was way too much. \nWe tried the creme brûlée for dessert and it was good! Creamy in the middle and crispy on top. \n\nTry to sit on the patio for a wonderful view of the strip and the Fountains of Bellagio!
