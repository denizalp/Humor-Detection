They have a great variety of sweets to choose from and their wedding cakes are very pretty,  but as far as taste goes,  kind of disappointing.   The ingredients seem subpar and everything tastes store bought.   Nothing I've had was rich and decadent, like the goodies I expect from an award-winning bakery. \n\nHowever,  customer service has always been good and I can't say I have ever had anything terrible...
