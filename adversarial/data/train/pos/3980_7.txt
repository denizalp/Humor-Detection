Okay, my very first time staying at The Mirage was when I was in 7th Grade... it was a cool place as a kid.  You had the rainforest\/jungle like atmosphere, the lions\/tigers, the volcano, and a pool w\/ waterfalls.  \n\nTwelve years later... the rooms have definitely been upgraded to a more modern take on hotel living.  I'm counting the furnishings, the art, and probably the TV.  The bathroom however, was small.  I think the room I had this time around had a smaller bathroom than the one I had witnessed as a kid with my parents.  The door is right in front of the toilet, so if someone is sitting, it would be kind of difficult to open the door (just saying).  There is only 1 sink & our tub was clogged upon the first time of using it.  \n\nCheck-in Process = No wait in line, quick, front desk receptionist was very helpful & courteous\n\nWalk from front desk to hotel room = a breeze - it was a pretty easy path to the elevators with much around you to look at.  Finding the room was also easy (nothing confusing about it).\n\nThe Room = I got the normal 2 queen standard room. 1 plasma TV, a desk area, 2 wireless phones, plenty of drawers & a closet with mirrored doors.  Hairdryer & Iron available inside, no need to request.  You're able to open the window to let some natural light and fresh air to flow through (a plus).  Beds were comfy & each bed comes w\/ 4 plush pillows.  There is an ipod speaker\/dock, but it only worked for ipod minis  :\/  Free wi-fi service.\n\nThe Room's View = We had a great view of the strip AND the pool (it was too bad that the pool wasn't open during the time I went, the pool was drained :(  haha\n\nRoom Service = I wasn't in the room when this was requested, but my friends said that it took a while for them to get their food & when it arrived, it tasted as though it was sitting there and had been forgotten about.  The food wasn't that great either.  This could have been due to the odd hour they ordered or it could have just been a busy night.  \n\nHotel Eateries = BLT Burger (highly recommend), Carnegie Deli (alright - good b\/c its 24\/7)  I would have liked to try more, but there just wasn't enough time \n\nHotel Lounges\/Club\/Bars = Revolution (ladies free admission & open bar 10-12am), 1OAK (my group and I got in for free & were given 3 free drink tix each!), Rhumbar (sadly didn't get to enjoy, but walked past a few times - indoor and outdoor area w\/ TV, heat lamps, and comfy looking patio furniture\n\nThe Casino = Clean, open, and nice.  Didn't walk around much, but it seemed smaller than other casinos in LV.  Definitely not dirty.\n\nCheck-out Process = Being that our TV wasn't able to turn on on our last morning there, I had to call to check out.  I already paid my fees in full when I checked in, so we were all good to go & it was completed on the spot. \n\nSide Notes:  About $20-25 ride from the McCarran Airport to The Mirage (TAXI), About $70 for a limo (to anywhere you want) - for us, it was to Encore at the Wynn (yes, a 2 minute ride... but hey, when the taxi lines are long, you have to opt for other means of transportation).\n\nDecent place, not too expensive (got a deal off Expedia - though I will say I though I booked in advance, I checked the prices the week of on the hotel's main website and prices were cheaper than what I had spent on the travel search engine - LAME, but oh well, better to be safe than sorry).  I wouldn't mind staying here again  :]
