I found Home Joy cleaning on Groupon and are very pleased with the cleaning service. Since Groupon we signed up for bi-weekly services and know thinking about weekly cleanings. I like that you can book your cleaning online and they remind you the day before that you are scheduled for a cleaning .I also like that they are always asking for your feedback to help better their services.Glad I tried them out!
