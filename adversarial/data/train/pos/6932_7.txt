Definitely a great date night! Or double date, if you're so lucky!  Was greeted immediately by a friendly group of wait staff and host.  I arrived before the group and was at the bar where a friendly waitress went over the wine list with me.  By no means do I know anything about the fermented grapes, but took her suggestion as to a great white wine which everyone at our table enjoyed when the non-punctuals arrived!  It doesn't stop there! The specials du jour list was endless! Seems like it took awhile for our server to get them all out!  I went with the sweet potato ravioli! WOW!  Great taste explosion!  Not entirely vegan though, so I went with it and was so happy I did.  meh, what's a lil butter right?  There wasn't a bad meal at the table!  \nIn other news, expect a very attentive wait staff and great food... It's a bit pricey, so expect to pay around 40 bucks or so a person for a 3 course meal and an adult beverage.\nDefinite thumbs and has some \"Woo\" potential if you've got a special someone who you'd like to impress!
