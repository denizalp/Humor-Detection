Two adults and one kid equals a 40 dollar meal.  It's not like we ordered everything on the menu either.  The kid had pancakes and a drink, the adults each had an omelet and one drink.  The pancakes were great, but the omelets were super salty, and the ingredients were the furthest thing from fresh.  The service was horrible.  They kept forgetting things, and it felt like they were trying to rush us out the door, even though there was only one other table there.  \n\nAnother reviewer mentioned having to walk through a service area, and it's true.  To get to the bathrooms you have to walk through a narrow service area that seems awkward.  The bathrooms were nasty dirty, next time I'll just hold it.  \n\nTo top it off I got food poisoning and spent the rest of the day suffering immensely.  \n\nThanks International House of Poop!!!
