.......Where are the chopsticks?\n\nA Chinese restaurant is clearly not Chinese when there are no chopsticks on the place setting! Tea was lukewarm upon arrival, tasted unauthentic, with the help of any ambiguous American tea bag. The hot and sour soup had peas...peas! Side of rice was stiff and tasted as if it had been in the cooker all day. Had the stir fry vegetable dish that consisted of broccoli, snow peas and mushrooms overly cooked to mush; where was my bok choy or kai lan or any type of actual authentic Chinese vegetables?!\n\nOne thing I do give them credit for: service was clean, fast, and efficient.\n\nOther than that, your money's better off at Panda Express right down the street. Same quality of food, and at least there you won't have to pay for tip!
