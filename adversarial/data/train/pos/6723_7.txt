Not to brag or anything, but I've had some damn good donuts in my day. And Ronald's stacks up with the best of 'em. \n\nMy donut obsession began at an early age, when my Dad used to take me with him to Harold's House of Donuts in Decatur on Saturday mornings while we waited to have his car washed\/detailed next door. As I got older, these trips became few and far between, but they'll always hold a special place in my heart. Heartwarming, I know...\n\nBut as I said earlier, I've had some awesome donuts since then, including World's Fair Donuts (St. Louis), Voodoo Donuts (Portland) and Psycho Donuts (San Jose). Each one has their own \"shtick\" and I happily gobbled up the offerings. What I liked about Ronald's is that there is no gimmick-  No cereal on top, fancy colors or witty names, just classic donuts at their best. It very much reminded me of Saturday mornings with my Dad at Harold's. Simple and a tad nostalgic. \n\nIf you're in Vegas and able to get out from partying on the Strip to try some truly local food, definitely hit up Ronald's. Nothing fancy, but it hits the spot.
