I don't know anything about plants, at all, but yesterday I decided I wanted one for my condo.  My hope was that if I went to prairie gardens, there would be lots of plants, the people working there would be really nice, and that even though I don't know anything about plants I would be able to find one suitable for the growing inside.  \n\nThat's what happened!  Surprise surprise!  When I walked into the greenhouse, there were three giant banners that said HOUSEPLANTS, from under which I made my selection.  When I walked back out, there was an entire wall of cheap ceramic pots of varying sizes to put my HOUSEPLANT in.  Awesome!
