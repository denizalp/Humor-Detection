I think there should be an option for no stars. I weant yeterday first time. Saw the add for poutine. 8 minutes later. She put it in a bag. With a fork. I take it to my car. I spilled some gravy in my jacket.  I look for napkin in my bag. Nothing. My hands were a mess from eating a skimpy portion if poutine.  Not worth the 3 bux. Will never ever go back. Unless I'm desparate.
