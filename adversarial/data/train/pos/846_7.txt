You will find culinary influences of Argentina when you visit Charbar, and if you get the chance take a peek at the Argentine wood-fired grill, one of the inspirations behind their identity.\n\nI have been here a handful of times already, and I'm slowly working my way through the menu. There is nothing I've tried and don't like. In fact I have favourites and tend to order them each time along with other dishes. Love smaller bites and being able to have several dishes in front of you at once. Every time I come I learn a little bit more about the restaurant and inspiration behind it.\n\nCharbar, along with 2 others (Phil & Sebastian Coffee Roasters and Sidewalk Citizen Bakery) are located in the historical Simmons building. When you are inside it feels like the walls and old wood posts have so much to say, I wish they could share their stories.\n\nWe were able to sit on the patio one night for my husbands birthday back in August before heading downstairs for dinner. Gorgeous views on the patio and a perfect date experience. Another time I've both lunched and dined with girl friends. Dinner meetings are lovely here as well and always accommodating. I even attended a recent wine event upstairs there complete with cheese bites. \n\nThrough my adventures the service has always been spot on. And the food incredibly flavourful. I love the variety of chimichurri sauces they have (I've tried 3: red\/green\/white) and as I mentioned I am working my way through the menu. One of my favourites is the Fugazza (pizza). \n\nCharbar has everything I look for in a great restaurant. Good service, incredible food, friendly staff, a lovely setting and ambiance, even the location is easy to get to. Resos recommended.
