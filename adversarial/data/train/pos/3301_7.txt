I came in at the perfect time. There was no line and no one behind me so I got to try a few samples without holding anyone up. They have some \"funky\" flavors like olive oil, spiced prune and black molasses. They do change their flavors out and have a suggestion box. I ended up going with Vietnamese coffee. It was light and just the perfect amount of coffee flavor. Not too sweet and the junior size was a perfect portion.
