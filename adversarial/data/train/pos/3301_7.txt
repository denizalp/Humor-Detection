Hever seen country line dancers dance to Hip-Hop? It's the craziest thing...\nIf you're looking for inexperienced drinkers and crazy loud country & hip-hop you will be stoked here. Drinks are cheap and the bartenders are young & attractive. The crowd clearly has very low inhibitions and a dress code is non-existant. Apparently I missed the \"Ladies Night Thong Contest\", what a bummer... lol\nI think I may be getting too old for places like the \"Whiskey D!ck River\"...
