Update! Visit#2 in 2 weeks....Lol \n\nI tried the 3 meat combo so that I could get the brisket... Tri tip and of course the smoked turkey. :) \n\nThe brisket was very tender and juicy and it just pulled apart... And it had a great smoke ring... With just the right amount of smoke flavor to it. (4.5\/5)\n\nSmokedâ€‹ turkey... Still gotta say it's a 5\/5... So freaking delicious! Will most definitely be getting this again...\n\nTri tip... This is where they surprised me.... It was so good!!! It was just like the brisket and had a great smoke ring and smoky flavor but the reason why this is a 5\/5 and ranked higher in my books compared to the brisket was that the meat flavor came through and just really balanced the flavor to make it even better then the brisket. So freaking delicious!!!!\n\nGotta come back.... I've missed my Texas BBQ and this is the place to come and get some!!\n\n***************************************************\n\n\nI gotta tell ya.... When you walk in...Omg the smell of the smoke just blows your mind or rather your nose...lol The smell brought me back to walking into bbq joints in Texas.... And the actual set up brought me firmly back to fun memories of sitting on picnic tables in the BBQ joints in my college days... Made me very nostalgic! :) And you have to love the paper towel holders in every section of the picnic tables. Ambiance (5\/5)\n\nNow does this place compare to pecan Lodge or Lockhart's in Dallas or the hole in the wall joints in Austin... Or county line... Or Rudy's.... Or Franklin's or the original salt lick in Austin....??\n\nI gotta say no... Compared to them they are not that great.... BUT compared to any other BBQ joint here in Vegas... They are number 1 in my books. Now I know where I will go if I'm craving some Texas BBQ!! I'm just mad that I waited this long to try them! Lol\n\nI had a bite of the bf's pulled pork and it had just the right amount of smoke and it was so juicy and flavorful! So yummy!! His fries and Mac and cheese were also delicious!!! So far so good! (5\/5)\n\nI got the 2 meat combo...I paid the $5 extra to get baby back ribs on the combo. Boy am I glad that I did!! The smoke ring and the bark on the ribs... So yummy! (4.5\/5) it was a little dry towards the end of the slab.... But it was one of the best ribs I've had here in Vegas! The meat was tender and very flavorful and it was meaty!!! I've had some ribs that were just bone with teeny tiny bits of meat on there but the ribs here has some delicious chunks of meat with the perfect amount of fat running through it.  For my second meat, I got the smoked turkey and you might be asking yourself.... Really???? Smoked turkey in a BBQ joint? Wth??? But I gotta tell ya... I've had some amazing smoked turkey in Texas and when I saw it...I had to try it. And they did not disappoint! It was tender, Succulent and the lightly Smoky. It was so good! (5\/5)\n\nI can't forget the sides...I had the fried okra... Delish! Perfectly crunchy and fried to perfection so that there was no sliminess! (5\/5) the creamed corn on the other hand was a little too sweet for my taste buds and not as creamy as I was expecting...I guess the creamed corn at Rudy's had ruined me...Lol (4\/5)\n\nOverall, Big B's Texas BBQ brought back nostalgic memories of eating delicious bbq in Texas which I was sorely missing here in Vegas....I can't wait to come back and try the brisket and the tri-tip.... My mouth is watering just thinking about the great meats I had here.
