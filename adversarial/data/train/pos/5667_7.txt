Shut. The. Front. Door.\n\nYou need to try the savory crepes here for breakfast or anytime of day.  I'm sure the rest of the menu is delicious but I'm still dreaming of the Forrest Crepe with the over easy gooey egg on top.  Seriously the best crepes I have ever had!\n\nEverything else here looked amazing, too!  Especially the gelato but we didn't try it.\n\nUnfortunately there isn't a smoke free area to eat your food inside the Aria :-(\n\nSo we took the crepes to our room and enjoyed eating in a smoke free space.
