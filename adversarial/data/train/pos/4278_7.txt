Do you want to know what your body fat percentage is? Or how about your resting metabolic rate (RMR)?  Well, we found a place where all can be revealed to you.  Referred by our trainer, the b\/f and I met up with Dave at Bod Pod, located inside of Anytime Fitness on Lake Mead near Sun City in Summerlin.  The whole process only took about ten minutes.  Clients can go through the testing once for $50 or get three tests for $100, which we chose so that we can see our fat loss progress over time, planning to return at different intervals in the next few months.  Come prepared to sit in the pod, an egg-looking contraption, for about 3 minutes while your body composition is tested.  Much more accurate than calipers, BMI formulas, or those bio-electric impedence devices at the gym, Bod Pod is closest to the results you would get with hydrostatic underwater fat testing, considered to be the most accurate testing of all. For the test, women should wear a swimsuit or compression shorts with a sports bra; men should wear swim trunks or compression shorts with no padding.  \nWhy do you need this information anyway?  If you're serious about fitness and fat loss, knowing your RMR will help you reach your goals.  The RMR result will tell you exactly how many calories you need to eat to lose or gain weight. Knowing what your body fat percentage is will tell exactly how much fat you're carrying around as well as your lean body mass. Armed with this info, you can get moving towards your fitness goals.  Thanks, Dave--we'll see you soon!\nClick here for more info: http:\/\/leanbodymetrics.com\/
