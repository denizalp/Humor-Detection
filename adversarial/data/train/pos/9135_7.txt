Couple of facts about Buffalo Wild Wings.  \n\nFact #1:  This place serves a lot more than just wings.  Buffalo Wild Wings also serves burgers, sandwiches, wraps, soups, salads and a ton of apps.  \n\nFact #2:  I recommend BWW if chicken wings is your thing.  They have a ton of flavors and their wings are pretty good too.  Just in case you didn't know...the wings are made of chicken, not buffalo. \n\nI've been to this Buffalo Wild Wings twice in the last 30 days.  I got the same thing on both visits.  I got their bacon cheeseburger and a side of chili.  Service was excellent on the first visit and no so great on the second.\n\n2nd Visit Dialogue w\/Server\nMe:  Do you have a lunch menu? (by the way, I know they do)\nServer:  Yes, we do.  I don't have one on me, but can get one.  \nMe:  That would be great.\nServer:  But are you sure you're going to get something from the lunch menu?\nMe:  Not sure yet.  I haven't looked at it yet. \n\nIt was obvious to me that our server didn't want to bring us the lunch menu.  She eventually brought one over.  And yes, I ordered from it.  The chili was good, and my bacon cheeseburger was missing the bacon.
