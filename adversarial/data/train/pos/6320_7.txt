Great facility for the experienced and inexperienced! Clean, great staff, and one of the best indoor facilities in the Charlotte area.  I received individual instruction from Don Bryant and he goes out of his way to make sure you have strong fundamentals for gun safety and gun  operation.  I learned so much and would highly recommend for first timers and the experienced. Large gun selection and normal range in gun prices but good deals when you can catch them.
