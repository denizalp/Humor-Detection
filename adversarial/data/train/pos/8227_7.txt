It took me 1 year to give Yu Seafood's dim sum a second try and I had been back twice already in March. And the experience and food has improved so much that I decided to write an update.\n\nI tried out quite a few items on the menu, not everything was perfect but a big improvement from the nightmarish experience I had last time. Gone was the huge serving plates and sweet\/sour sauce in the plating!\n\nBeef Rice Roll (M) 碧綠牛肉腸 - 3\/5\nCashew Nut Chicken and Vegetable Dumplings (M) 潮洲田園粉果皇 - 4\/5 love the wrappings \nMixed Puff with Pork (M) 香梨咸水- 4\/5 They are just too cute!\nMushroom and Vegetable Dumplings (M) 野珍菌菜苗餃 - 2.5\/5 Not too much flavour and the wrapping too thick\nPortugese Egg Tarts (M) 葡式旦撻 - 1\/5 just don't order that...\nSpecial BBQ Pork Bun (M) 天下第一包 - 4.5\/5 just as good or better than a year ago: Sweet and Savoury!\nSteamed Chicken Feet (M)麒麟醬鳯爪 - 3\/5 OK \n\nDeep Fried Durian Cake (L) 飄香榴蓮酥- 2\/5 usually I love Durian dessert, but the oil that was they used made it tasted stale\nMixed Mushroom and Veggie Roll (L) 米湯鮮竹卷- 2.5\/5 Nice presentation but not worth for 2 small rolls\nPork and Shrimp Shumai (L) 錦袍燒賣皇 - 3\/5 not much flavour and lack texture, no meat juice and no wow\nShrimp and Scallops Dumplings (L) 乾明太魚餃- 4\/5 so cute! I wish the kitchen would do more dumplings like this\nShrimp Dumplings (L)  漁膳鮮蝦餃- 4\/5 big bouncy shrimps used for the filling and love the perfect wrappings!\n\nLobster and Fish Congee (SP) 龍蝦斑球粥- 5\/5 just order this if you are a congee and seafood lover! Almost every table put in an order of congee.\n\nI guess I would be coming back! :)
