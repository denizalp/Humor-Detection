This is a great find in the southwest side of Las Vegas. Excellent owners who really take pride in their business. Superior equipment and a hand full of classes in a private room as well. They also offer tanning. Chris and Shelly also both offer personal training. And some of their instructors are the same people you will see at the Big Fitness clubs here in the city.
