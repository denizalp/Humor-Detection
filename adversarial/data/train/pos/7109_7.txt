Disappointed. How do they claim to be an Italian restaurant when their pasta is worse than East Side Mario's?\n\nSpaghetti in Canna a Mare (fresh clams and mussels, calamari, scallops and tiger shrimp, light tomato sauce, mildly spicy) for $22.95 - Let me start off by saying that this pasta does not come with cheese :( but that's not even the problem. The pasta itself is SEVERELY UNDERCOOKED. I might as well have eaten the pasta raw and dry. It was extremely stiff and tough to chew on, my jaw was aching after 2 bites. The seafood was also undercooked, the mussels weren't even opened yet. Overall, it was bland. Very bland. There was no flavour to it whatsoever. It's not even a \"light pasta\", it just had no seasoning whatsoever and it really lacked a sauce. I just ate all the raw seafood and left the pasta because I'm pretty sure I wouldn't be able to digest it. Seafood pasta is my all-time favourite pasta dish and Terroni has ruined it for me.\n\nTortelloni di Ricotta (handmade spinach tortelloni filled with ricotta and pecorino with butter, sage and parmigiano) for $22.95 - this pasta was very dry but the filling of the tortelloni itself was yummy. Flavours were much better than the seafood pasta, but the mushrooms were very dehydrated and had this weird chewy texture to it. \n\nCarpaccio di Manzo (hand cut, raw beef tenderloin, lemon juice, extra virgin olive oil, parmigiano reggiano shavings, arugola) for $15.95 - I am aware that carpaccio is thin, but this was so thin I couldn't even pick it off the plate to eat, making it very difficult to even enjoy this dish. The flavour combination was okay there was pretty much no tenderloin.
