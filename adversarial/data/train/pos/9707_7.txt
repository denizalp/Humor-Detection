Great place to relax on a quiet afternoon. I came here today with my laptop to get some writing done. I couldn't get wifi but it was okay since I didn't need the internet for what I was doing. Everyone else in the cafe was alone reading a book\/newspaper. At first, I was worried this is one of those cafes that is anti-laptop (hence no wifi or outlets), but nobody gave me any attitude and I'm relieved to see here that other people do come here with computers! \n\nAnyways, the place was QUIET. I took a seat at the communal table and typed away. Until this couple came in. They sat right across from me and they were on a first date. And it was awwwkward. I didn't mean to eavesdrop but it was painful... \"I haven't done this in a while. I'm sorry, I'm nervous\" *silence*. Thankfully, they seemed to warm up to one another and I did hear gems such as \"it is heretical to write Star Trek fan fic\" and \"oh yeah that book is a spoof of meta-spoof\". Luckily, when the girl's safety call on her cell came (so I guess girls still do this! \"oops, this is a call from work I have to take...\"), she didn't answer it. I left before they did, but was secretly rooting for them:) \n\n*Note to self: do not set up first dates in super-quiet cafes... \n\nHalf way through, the barista also remembered to turn on some music. Sarah McLachan. Talk about wayback playback! \n\nI had the nutella latte, and yes, I was asked if I wanted to lick the spoon. (So, I did). I liked it, but I can't say it was any different from a regular mocha latte anywhere else. \n\nNice selection of books, cozy environment, good service. Two thumbs up!
