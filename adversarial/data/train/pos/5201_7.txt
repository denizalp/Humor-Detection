We booked a jr suite paid a good amount for the room and The room had maggots!!!!!!!! So freaking disgusting!!!!!! We called the front desk and all he did was put some windex on the table. Who knows if the room is infested with more maggots. Just disappointed because we paid hundreds of dollars a night to be in a maggot infested room.
