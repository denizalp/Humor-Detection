Today I thought I would try Little Hong Kong again.  My 1st experience left me feeling neglected by the staff and the food portions were off between my husbands and I.  His Orange chicken was enough to feed two and my Lemon chicken was a very thin small chicken cutlet.  But sometimes a off nite happens so I wasn't ready to rule them out.  Today I left with the same feeling of neglect.  The staff while ordering and bring the food was very attentive and friendly but after the main dish was served disappeared behind the counter to play on the internet.  Our soup dishes were never cleaned off the table and we had to wait for a refill or our drinks.  Today I tried the Beef and Broccoli and although the beef was tender and veggies crisp they were very very bland.  I did like the fried rice but think I will go elsewhere for my next craving for Asian cuisine.
