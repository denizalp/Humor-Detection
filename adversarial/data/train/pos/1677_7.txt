Back so soon?  I guess habits really are hard to break.\n\nAnyway, I talked to the manager who was very nice and very apologetic about things that I've been told.  Sadly, the kimchee is not vegetarian but it could have been before since they do get different brands in from time to time.\n\nHowever, the miso IS vegetarian.  There is no fish in it like I was previously told.  Good news for this girl!\n\nSo I got me some Miso Ramen, vegetarian style.  It leaves out the pork, fish cake, and egg leaving behind corn, seaweed, bean sprouts, and tofu.  I really can't complain much about ramen because I'm such a carb freak (thanks, Italian genes!) and the noodles hit the spot.  However, the miso was a little plain so I kicked it up a bit with the condiments provided on the table.  It was definitely a good way to warm up on an unusual rainy day!\n\nMy husband got the veggie fried rice and now I know that I've been missing out with my Chinese options up here in the north.  Their fried rice was really good!  I might have stolen more than a couple of bites from him.\n\nNow I feel good about coming back here and I'm excited to have another noodle soup available on my rotation!  Plus this one is on the way home and easy to hit up when the mood strikes.\n\nThank you again to the manager for being so patient with this vegetarian.  I really appreciate it!
