On a Saturday evening some friends decided to head out to Union for a last minute birthday dinner. It was hard to get dinner reservations in downtown Toronto because of TIFF. The drive down out west from Brampton wasn't bad at all and we found parking conveniently infront of this restaurant\/bar. I walked in with my friend and the place was dimly lit, music wasn't too loud and this place was totally live. The atmosphere can work for a date night or a friends get together. We were seated along with our friends and the server Sarah was so friendly and thoroughly explained the dinner specials. Earlier in the day I had a huge double angus burger so I had no room for dinner but still needed to eat something ( hate that feeling). After I browsed through the menu, I decided to order some apps. I ordered the angus short rib sliders and the calamari. The server was really attentive and brought out all of our food at once. Now let me tell you about these 3 moist, flavourful, soaked in BBQ sauciness sliders.. Ahhh so good! I was thinking to order another round but then I thought to myself \"you ding bat you could've ordered an entree\". Anyway sad to say, the calamari wasn't too good. It was so salty and I actually started to get a headache from how overly salty it was! I got the servers attention and told her about the calamari and she was more than happy to get us something else. I took a good look at the menu again and decided to try the Mediterranean dip platter. After waiting about 10 minutes, she came out with med platter and I digged right in. The platter had pita and tortilla chips, with these three incredible dips; hummus, sundried tomato feta dip and calamata tapenade. It was so delicious that I ended up getting more chips because there was so much dip left. Now I'm awfully curious to try everything else on the menu. I will definitely be back for the dip and sliders.. Yum!!
