Too bad yelp makes you give 1 star. This is the worst business I have ever had to deal with. First and largest issue, no pun intended... The granddaughter of the owner must have a tree trunk much less a stick you know where. The most rude person I have met. Apparently they don't care about treating people with respect. They lose the shoes you bring in to get repaired..... Then act like it's your fault they don't even know how to organize their business. Rude rude rude, and a poorly run business that will defiantly fail even without loosing business from this review. After 35 min waiting they finally found the pair of sandals and 1 boot. Then said there will be no charge because they weren't able to get to them. Even though the ticket said they were done and we got a call saying they were done. I'm so glad they aren't going to charge for work they didn't do!!!! Duh!!!!! This was all for a wedding too and now we are sol. Drive anywhere else if you actually need shoe repair service. Worst business ever!
