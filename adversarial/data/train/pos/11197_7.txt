Loved it the first few times I went - it was packed and there were plenty of ladies to meet. Even up through Halloween, it was full on weekends and holidays, but pretty empty on weekdays (and they tried to charge cover when it was empty!). However, I went here on New Year's and my single friends were sad because it was all couples and ladies on dates. Around 1 am, a bunch of single, straight dudes randomly turned up?!  The DJ outside in the freezing cold was much, much better than the indoor DJ too. I like L4 a lot, especially the patio, but it's too cold out for these shenanigans. They seem to be struggling, I hope they make it to the warm weather so we can take advantage of the patio again.
