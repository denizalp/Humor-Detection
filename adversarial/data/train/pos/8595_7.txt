We have been coming here since this place opened and absolutely loved it. We had a bad experience about 3 months ago because they changed their menu and the quality was horrible. We decided to give it a second chance and we will never come back. They completely changed their menu there is one German item on it. If you enjoy eating a half melted block of cheese on top of a soggy flatbread, this is the place for you. I ordered the my boy bleu burger and they brought me the fancy burger. I ordered my burger medium and when they brought the correct burger it was a hockey puck. So. Overcooked. The bun was three days old and falling apart. It's a shame because their beers are on point but their food is so beyond subpar it's ridiculous. They have such a high turnover of staff, there is not a single employee we've seen more than once here unlike our normal spots, so there is definitely something up.
