So my standard for a Liquor store are selection and price.  Total Wine exceeds both!  They have an amazing selection of both wine and liquor.  They have a large selection of beer but I am not a beer drinker so I can't speak to the quality of the beer selection.   \n   One of my new favorite wines is 30% cheaper at Total Wine in comparison to Sam's Club.  Sam's was the only other location that had it in Vegas.  Their Liquor prices are very competitive.  In addition to competitive prices they have a selection to die for.  As someone who enjoys good Bourbon and Scotch their large selection made me envious.  \n  I was putting some goodies int the cart when Ryan the Wine and Liquor Manager walked by and saw my items.  He asked if I had tried a couple of items of which I hadn't and said - follow me.  He took me to the tasting area and let me try Kavalan whiskey aged in a sherry cask and 24 year old Papa Pilars Rum aged in a sherry cask.  They were both so good that I added them to my selections.  Wow what a deal to be able to try these before buying them!\n   The store is huge and packed full of allot of unique items that only Total Wine carries.  They are far better than any other liquor store in Vegas!  If they don't have that item you are looking for ask them and they will do their best to get it for you.
