Good place for a cheap bite.  Being on a recession diet is hard, but so I stretch my meals by eating at Dunkin' Donuts.  \n\nThis location as I may have mentioned before is directly across the street from my jobbie job.  When this location first opened they offered a 10% discount to employees of the USX Steel Tower...well that discount has been discontinued that was kind of a bummer. \n\nWhat I like is the cheap eats.  They do a three piece pancake wrapped sausage bite that are only $1.39 and all donuts are a dollar.
