The service here was awesome. I recently started a beginner ballet class and I had no clue what type of shoes I would need or anything. The lady that helped me (I wish I could remember her name!!) was so helpful and informative. She helped me pick out my slippers and my stockings and even gave me a 10% discount! I will definitely be coming back here for Halloween costumes and more dance wear!! Thanks!
