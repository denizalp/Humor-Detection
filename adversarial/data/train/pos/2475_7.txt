My family and I went to Wazee's world on Friday night (3\/14\/14) for the unlimited laser tag night. We have been here many times before and go out of our way to come here. ( We are a good 20+ miles away from Wazee's) We have always had great service each time we have come here. However, this particular night was ruined by the man, Russ, who was attending the snack bar.  After our first game of laser tag I wanted to get a cup for water, at this point we had already bought 2 pizzas and everyone had gotten a drink. When I went to ask for a cup for water Russ responded with pointing his finger in the direction of the water fountains and said \"we have water fountains.\" I was appalled with how rude he was, he was acting as if I was a dog.  With this being said, my family and I will no longer come here after this horrible display of customer service.
