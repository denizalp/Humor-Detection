Great service people, especially Amir!  Every time I have brought my car in for service I have been provided with a loaner... and not just any loaner, but an S5 convertible.  That makes me feel MUCH better about spending hundreds of dollars on service.\n\nIt's a bit of a drive for me to go here, but it's worth it!
