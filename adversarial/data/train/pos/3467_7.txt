Last night when the wind was blowing everything and everyone around...it blew me right into Jaz-Jan The Sweet Joint.  I'm trying to do better this year with my sweet cravings but I thought to myself, \"One for me and one for the bf shouldn't be too bad\", so I treated myself.  I only ordered two, a Banana Pudding Cupcake for me and the Strawberry Lemonade for him.  I've already tasted the Strawberry Lemonade and it's taste just like the name...perfect.  The icing is what really gets you!  This was the first time for the Banana Pudding Cupcake and when I took the first bite I had to stop and look down to make sure this was a cupcake and not actual banana pudding.  WOW!  It was wonderful and I immediately kicked and thanked myself for only buying one for myself b\/c I would have ended up eaten all of them last night.  I dare say that I tasted pieces of fresh banana in the cupcake itself.  I didn't even think about taking a picture but maybe next time...b\/c I'm definitely going back in for another one!  The cupcake was super moist and the icing tasted just like banana pudding!  If you're reading this...stop by Jaz-Jan The Sweet Joint, you won't be disappointed.  Oh and it helps that the ladies inside are super sweet!!!
