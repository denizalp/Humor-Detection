I've always felt there are two items that are consistent indicators of the overall quality of a sushi restaurant... saba or uni. I took the saba test and Sushi Roku got low marks. The fishier the saba generally the less awesome your sushi meal will be and sure enough, my saba was pretty fishy and the overall meal was edible, but not stellar. \n\nGranted I was eating sushi in landlocked Scottsdale, so perhaps the joke is on me. Alas I was tired from my travels and was in desperate need of food, so I can't say I thought about my dining decision before going in. \n\nThe interior is pretty sleek (as is the decor of the whole hotel) so I'd say it'd still be a fun spot for a date. Our server was pretty cool too. \n\nFinal word: If you're staying in the hotel, don't feel like branching out, and have no price sensitivity, it's fine.
