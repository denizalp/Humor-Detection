Made the mistake of coming back a second time to purchase a dining table.  First time was a nightmare (see Ashley Furniture Henderson review) now after pushing a delivery date two weeks already, they are calling me to notify me that the table will be delivered but no chairs are available for another three months... What the hell am I supposed to do with a dining table and no chairs.  This company is absolute garbage.
