After an entire fun filled weekend full of vodka and cheap beer (though maybe not cheap in price), I was looking to grub on something hearty.\n\nI searched 'vegan' on Yelp and saw that Husson's has an entire vegan menu! Hallelujah! So I drove my car...err...inched my car down the strip and made my way into the Mandalay Bay Shoppes where the restaurant is located.\n\nRight as you sit down, you can order a giant margarita, or something a bit less sugary like a tall glass of cerveja. \nA giant basket of chips is presented to you with not 1or 2, but 3 different types of salsa! (My favorite one is the sweeter tasting one with chunks of what looks like mango inside!\n\nIt took a long time for me to order because I simply could not decide what I wanted. Quesadillas, Tostadas, Enchiladas, Tacos, Chimichangas...alll Veganized! I asked for a recommendation and finally settled on the Chile Relleno. Because I've never had a vegan Chile Relleno before!\n\nFor one person, these are huge portions! There was a crispy tortilla topped with the grilled poblano chile stuffed Gardein Chik'n strips (there's beef available too!), onions, tomatoes, and potatos. Finally, it is covered in melted Daiya cheese and guacamole. Yum.. If that's not enough, there's a huge scoop of rice and beans on the side too!\n\nI barely made a dent in my food before I had to pack it up to-go. The dish was pretty good. It's not 'authentic' in any way, but for the moment, it hit all the right spots.\n\nFriendly service rounded out the meal, and happiness knowing that if I end up staying on this side of the strip away from the comforts of Steve Wynn's vegan-option paradise, I can count of this place to provide me a hearty vegan meal!
