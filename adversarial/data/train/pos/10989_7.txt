MIX was a bizarre amalgam of confusion and surprises.\n\nCall me retarded but I never even knew that they had a restaurant in this joint.  I've been up to the lounge many times but was unaware that if you wound your way to the back, there was a large dining room.  Well whaddyaknow... the things you learn when you're not being a pissed drunk cocknozzle and stumbling into the 61st floor elevator \"to check out the view\" for the 12th time.\n\nTHE AMBIANCE\nAnyway, despite not knowing that there are actually two entrances to this place (one from THE Hotel side for the restaurant and one from MBay for the lounge) I did manage to hunt down the maitre d' and get myself seated in a room that might otherwise be described as sterile & cold but with a 70's- porn-esque all-white d√©cor and a monstrous chandelier made up off hand blown glass bubbles.  Sort of reminded me of a demure N9NE Steakhouse without all the overdone lighting... or the constant & entertaining parade of boobs walking in on high heels from Moon or Rain.   Yep, this doesn't look good.\n\nTHE SEATING\nI sat next to several Gucci & DKNY decorated couples reminding me of my single days - ah, good times.  But overhearing their conversations, it seemed unanimous however that this restaurant was not really a destination amongst those that were there.  In fact, everyone seemed to be there 'just because it was open and available' and they decided to give it go.  Again, not exactly a ringing endorsement if all 4 couples are entirely new customers with none returning.  The view was pleasant enough of course, being that the Mandalay Bay's view of the strip is unmatched and of course the cocktails were top shelf with the property being half watering hole.\n\nTHE MENU\nYum.  Menu's lookin' good.  Lobster Caesar.  Hot Chicken\/Coconut Thai Soup.  Bigeye Tuna Tartare.  Seared Duck Foie Gras.  Eggplant\/Zucchini\/Tomato\/Mozzarella Gazpacho. Shrimp Cocktail.  Spicy Crab Salad w\/ Guacamole & Heart of Palm & Cilantro.  Hmm!  That last one sounds good.  Excuse me waiter... hit me up with one of those.   \n\nThe waiter proceeds to let me know they also have, along with the regular menu, a \"Rossini\" Filet that's available off-the-menu:  An 8 oz Filet Mignon topped with Seared Foie Gras and slices of truffles, served in a wine & beef reduction sauce.  GAH!  Must... have... Rossini!   I did eyeball a few other dishes on the menu such as the Roasted Maine Lobster \"Au Curry\" w\/ Coconut Basmati Rice, Striped Bass w\/ Roasted Fennel, Seared Scallops with Sweet Corn Fricassee & Bacon, and Prawn Crusted Halibut... but I remained firm and stuck to my guns like a mole to Cindy Crawford's face.\n\nTHE VERDICT?\nI was embarrassed that I'd been secretly bagging on the restaurant in the back of my mind.  Serves me right for pre-judging.  The salad was scrumptious, reminding me of a Peeky toe crab appetizer that I once had at \"Joe's Seafood, Steak, & Stone Crab\" at Caesar's Forums.  The bed of lump crab meat was spiced with a tomato dressing & a bit of pepper & cilantro balanced with a topping of mouthwatering coolness:  A large 'hat' of guacamole & palm heart strips.  I challenged myself not to gobble it down like Fred Flintstone.  I failed epically and horked it down.\n\nThe meal was accompanied by a variety of breads & two different types of room temperature butter - a peanut-based butter and a traditional.  One thing that was a refreshing surprise was a complimentary drink:  The chef's spin on a Pina Colada served in a martini glass featuring a heavy coconut froth atop pineapple rum.  Strong but without the alcohol taste, this is a deal-closer for any single guy.  Ladies beware.\n\nBut the steak... ooh, that steak.  That was damn good steak.  Used to a bit more char & grilling and a lot less 'sauce', this MIX preparation of a Rossini steak had a monstrous amount of foie gras to allow the diner a bit in every bite, along with just enough truffles to savor along the way.  I easily sliced the filet into thin strips and in an instant, this became one of my favorite entrees of the week.  I was so impressed that I ended up using it as a benchmark for other steaks I had during my trip including those at Del Frisco's, Fleur D' Lys, Rosemary's, & ENVY Steakhouse.\n\nThe dinner was closed with a complimentary pair of fresh-baked Madeleines with a warm nutella dip.  Pleasant.\n\nCONCLUSION\nIf you go to the restaurant, and you're a food snob, try not to turn your nose up too quickly.  If anything the salad and steak I had was utterly satisfying and I'd hate for MIX to have to deal with more rat bastards like myself. \n\n4-Stars.
