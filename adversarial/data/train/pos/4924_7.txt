$9 for a chicken salad that consists of bagged salad, maybe two pieces of cucumber and chicken that has a gamey taste. You'd think I would learn after three times but not so much. I'm told the sandwiches are delicious. Not sure I'm willing to try. This is one of a few places located on the very bottom floor of the USX Tower there to serve lunch to the thousands working in the building. So I'm guessing it's easy to sell overpriced grocery store bagged lettuce to us.
