New Greatime Corp? Hey what kind of business name is this?? \n\nNew Greatime Corp is really a Northern Chinese Spicy Hot Restaurant. It might give some of their customers New Great Time.. but for us the experience is just Meh... \n\nGood\n- Nice and Clean, it is opened recently\n- Excellent looking menu.. every single dish has a photo! Even diet coke! No 2nd guessing what you ordering \n- Cheap Beer!! $2.50 for a Canadian VS Cplus for $1.50! \n- TV showing popular Chinese game show! (when your dinner mate kept laughing and you think that he might have a good time eating with you!)\n- Open daily from 4 pm to 3 AM, good place for late night after clubbing meals!\n\nBad: Food is MEH!\nDan Dan Noodle ($5.99)\nIt is really spicy even for my standard as my friend just could not handle the heat. But the only good thing about the noodle is its spiciness.. soaked in hot oil..yes those are hot chilli oil not soup. The noodle is the store brought type.. meh. The portion is huge! \n\nWhole Fish in Chili Oil ($20)\nAll these chili peppers, floating in hot oil!! The fish is the fresh, not previous frozen. If you go with someone that will eat any part of a fish esp head then go ahead and order. Tons of veggie (bean sprouts\/chinese cabbages) underneath, but think about them soaking in hot boiling oil! I find that it is not too spicy if you avoid eating those peppercorns.\n\nSteam Soup dumplings ($5)\nNot a place for Northern Dim Sum. Though the dumplings are quite soupy and has decent flavour, but I find the skin quite doughy. They have to be eaten right away, if not the skin will turn hard and chewy!\n\nNew Greatime Corp is another hot and Spicy Sichuan restaurants opened up in the Scarborough\/North York area. But it will not be the one I will recommend as a to go place if you have craving for some hot and spicy food.\n\nCash Only!
