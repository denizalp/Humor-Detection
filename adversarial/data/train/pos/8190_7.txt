There are many choices for doggie daycare in the area. There area  few my pooch and I rotate between but our pick for proximity and the amount of joy he displays when we pull up is hands down Club Fetch.\n\nThey are attentive while making sure the pooches are active and safe. They do a terrific job of posting photos of your pup on their Instagram and Facebook which is such a treat while traveling or just at work. If you live in the Southend or Dilworth area give Club Fetch a try - plus it's not far off 77 if you work uptown and live in South Charlotte.
