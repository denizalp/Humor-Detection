Friendly service, outdoor seating and decent food.\n\nWe came here because I was craving wings and the Hubster was craving a patio. A patio seat on St. Clair Ave. West isn't the best spot to be, particularly after a soccer game finishes. We ordered two pounds of wings and an order of lattice fries. The wings actually came with homefries, but I didn't actually see that. It was a nice surprise and they were pretty good, but come on. LATTICE FRIES! The wings were pretty good, the piper hot (hottest ones) were REALLY hot. They were very generous with the habanero peppers. Taste wise, they were just okay. Nothing special.\n\nNote, when we were there, two separate families with their toddlers were there, too. The place has a kid's menu, so it might not be the best place to be if you like to swear a lot.\n\nThe patio is tiny. It has two tables and seats maybe 6 at the very most. We didn't really go inside at all. Service was friendly and quick.
