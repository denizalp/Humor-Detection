Gordon Ramsay didn't let me down.  I had this place bookmarked for awhile and I wanted to know what the hype was about with the burgers.  This place is located inside of Plant Hollywood when we walked up, there was a long line.  That's a good sign that this place is popping and it's good OR there's just a bunch of tourists that wants to try Mr. Ramsay burgers.  Either way my curiosity was heightened.  \n\nI came here on a weekday in the afternoon and I waited for about 30 minutes for a table and regardless it was well worth it.  We were greeted by our friendly server, who gave great recommendations and she was so attentive.  We ordered the following:\n\nTruffle Parmesan Fries- hand cut fries, truffle parmesan, truffle salt, truffle aioli -$11. They were good, but nothing mind blowing.  \n\nOreo Shake with Creme Brulee-$9 it was so good. Their shakes are delicious, so rich and creamy.\n\nEuro Burger- truffle aioli, goat cheese, arugula, and oven roasted tomato- $16.  My wife had this burger and she's typically not a fan of burgers, but she thoroughly enjoyed it.  \n\nFarm Burger- duck breast bacon, cheese and fried egg- $15.  The combination of this burger was delicious.  The meat was juicy and tender and the saltiness of the duck breast bacon complimented the burger. The egg was over easy and gushing out from the burger with every bite.  It was perfection.  \n\nWould I come back?! Most definitely to try other burgers and shakes on the menu.  The menu is complimentary if you want to keep it for a souvenir.
