I had takeout. I ordered: butter chicken ($10), palak paneer ($7.50), and two naans with no oil ($1.50 each).\n\nValue\/Portion Sizes: The portion sizes were tiny. The two naans were quite little for $1.50. Also, $10 and $7.50 for the two dishes?! You can get more for your money at other places. This would be okay if they came with a salad, rice, or something to make up for the very small amount of food I got. However, that must all be purchased separately. If only the portion sizes were reasonable for how much I paid, I would give this restaurant a better rating.\n\nButter Chicken: This was very tasty, and it was the \"sweeter\" kind of butter chicken which I am a big fan of. It was, however, a little too oily. However, it was without a doubt one of the most delicious butter chickens I have ever tasted. But please, go easy on the oil next time.\n\nPalak Paneer: Just like the butter chicken, this one was very delicious. However, this one did not have an excessive amount of oil, which is great! It was perfect really. In fact, it's the most delicious palak paneer I have ever tasted...so far. Creamy, full of flavour, and a good amount of paneer (cheese) was in it.\n\nNaan: Delicious, and not oily, like the restaurant claims.\n\nOVERALL: The food is delicious, it's just a shame that the portion sizes are too small for what you pay!\n\nNote: I want to try the buffet; I think it'll be a much better deal.
