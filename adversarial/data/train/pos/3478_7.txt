Neato 50's themed diner. Pretty authentic. Has the little jukeboxes on each table and the black and white tiles. It is a railroad type car building authentic. The menu is extensive. What I got was just okay not great not bad. The serving I found a bit small for a diner. However, the other people around me seemed to have fuller plates so maybe a sandwich is the way to go here. (I got the open turkey sandwich with stuffing side and a very large slice of carrot cake for the ride home) \n\nI was going to give 4 stars but went to three. Let me explain why. The ladies working here were very nice but I do think they should be more attentive and careful with the front door service. I waited five minutes after walking in to have anyone even come out of the kitchen to greet me. That is too long. The door seems noisy enough to hear folks entering if they are in the kitchen but maybe not. Perhaps they can get a cowbell. However, there were three people working so not sure why this happened. Ha! I get they are busy I used to work in many restaurants but still? Beyond that the service was good. \n\nI also had to knock off a star due to the ladies bathroom and entryway area in front of it. It was very dirty. In fact, it was pretty disgusting. The floor was so sticky in the entry way arch area my shoes stuck to the tiles.  \n\nI am all for second chances. I would go again. I hope I can up them to four stars the next time with a different meal choice. I want to love them because the place is so darling and the owners are from Ny.( LOL) They also have cool memorabilia on the wall, sell fun things, and donate to charity. I like to support local good peeps.
