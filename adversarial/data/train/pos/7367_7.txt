The food was good. The ingredients were fresh and portions were fairly big. What I love about Chinese food is that you can eat a lot of food without breaking the bank. There was even enough food for left overs.\n\nOne of the dishes that I really enjoyed was the squid, duck, and Chinese greens. My favourite part of this was the steamed duck. It was delicious. Since I was craving this, we ordered the shrimp rice noodle roll. There is quite a lot of shrimp in the roll. We also ordered a noodle dish with beef and Chinese leafy greens. For starters we had the seafood soup with oysters, and rice. It was almost broth like, with bits of rice.  \n\nThe d√©cor is different with the top part of the restaurant modeled after the traditional Chinese pawn shops. The place is pretty big with lots of seating.\n\nThe waiters here were friendly and the service was pretty quick. I'd come back to visit if I was in the area.
