Waheeyyy!! Looks like I have finally found my favourite Burger spot in MTL!\n\nWe decided to try this place out one Friday evening and what an unforgettable experience it was! \n\nThe place is simple and comfortable with a sufficient amount of seating and the workers are all super friendly & hospitable. \n\nThe menu has a variety of Burger options - I opted for the Picante (spicy) one with a poutine. The burgers are huge and super juicy, each bite is better than its previous! Just super delicious, succulent patties topped with their signature sauce and the full works of dressings - the spice level was definitely on point! I also loved the Poutine as the fries are hand-cut with potato skin - my favourite!\n\nNow for the best part of the evening... \nWe enjoyed this whole experience in total darkness! Just so it happened, as the waiter was bringing out our order, the entire area lost electricity and it was pitch black. With everyone's phone lights switched on, nothing could stop us from devouring this masterpiece of a burger... it truly was an experience to remember! The owner even brought us over some drinks on the house, which was very kind of him. \n\nCannot wait to be back - hopefully this time to enjoy the Burgers through sight and not just through taste :)
