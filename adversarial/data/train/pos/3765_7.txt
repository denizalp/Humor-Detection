Has anyone ever heard of a spot-delivery scam? We hadn't either until buying a car from Chapmam Ford. \n\nMy husband purchased a 2014 Ford Focus on February 14th and was told that everything was a done deal and, after trading in his 2013 Honda Civic as a down payment, he drove off the lot with his new car. Everything was great until a month later (03\/13\/15). My husband was at work and Ford came and towed his car, telling him that the financing had fallen through. He got Uber to pick him up and rushed to the dealership where Tate the Snake told him that leasing the car was no longer an option but that he could buy it and make payments for $100 over the original monthly price. My husband told them no and to give him his old car back to which they responded saying they had already sold the car. This (among many other things they have done) is illegal. Section 44-1371 of the Arizona law states it. He told them that if they sold the car, that he is entitled to the $4,500 that they valued the trade in at (which he is). They told him no, and after hours of arguing, offered to let him buy the car for monthly payments of $60 more than the original agreed upon price. My husband said he did not want to work with them and to write him a check for the value of his original car and Tate the Snake went and locked himself in his office. \n\nMy husband left the dealership with no car and no compensation for the car that they stole from him and let them know that they will be hearing from our attorneys. If they choose to not cooperate after hearing from our attorneys then we will be filing a lawsuit. \n\nDo not trust the lying scumbags at Chapman Ford. Their company is full of illegal activity, and after reading all of their other reviews, I'd say it's a guarantee that they will screw you over.
