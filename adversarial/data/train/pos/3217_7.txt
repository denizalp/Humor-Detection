Sake-To-Me!\nLiterally! So I should have called Sangeetha to tell her I was coming here, but I just stopped by after a visit to Tokyo Discount...\nGreg and Miko warmly welcomed me, and when they learned I was engaged, I got cold unfiltered sake on the house!  yum.  \nMy meal consisted of the long-awaited spicy tuna bowl with soft shell crab on top, nimono, and saba sashimi, plus matcha iced tea (surprise, surprise).\nThe bowl: soooo good, fulfilled my cravings.  The soft shell crab was very crispy and tasty, but not greasy at all.  This was served beautifully with cucumbers, masago, lemon slices, and daikon.\nThe nimono: This is basically Japanese comfort food.  Daikon, carrot, potato, taro, fish cake, and maybe burdock cooked in dashi-esque broth.  Warm, soft, delish...\nThe saba: Cured to perfection, delicate but flavorful, cut by the master.  I ate the daikon and the perilla leaf too.\nThe tea and sake: satisfying counterbalances :)\nand yes, it was packed in there fairly late on a Thursday!\nLook for an upcoming UYE one of these days, super-vegetarian-friendly!
