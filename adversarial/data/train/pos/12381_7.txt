My brother told me this place was opening up so we decided to go yesterday. Being a relatively new fan of poke with the opening of Ahipoki Bowl this year, I was looking forward to trying a new place, thought I didn't see any marketing or advertising for here.\n\nWe came around noon and they had some balloons indicating that they were open. We came in and the menu is similar to that of AB: start off with a base of white rice, brown rice, greens, kale, or half and half. Then you choose 2 proteins, sauce and your toppings (extra protein and certain toppings are extra). I got the half and half with white rice and greens and my only suggestion is that they include some spinach and romaine in their greens, rather than just using the iceberg lettuce mix.\n\nFor my proteins, I got salmon and spicy tuna and spicy mayo, along with edamame, ginger, crab salad, sprouts, cucumber, green onions, sesame seeds and chili flakes. They have Sriracha and soy sauce to add too.\n\nOverall it was a filling meal and the employees were friendly. I would also suggest they do more social media and marketing to get the word out about this new business because I wouldn't have known about it unless my brother saw it as he visits this shopping complex.
