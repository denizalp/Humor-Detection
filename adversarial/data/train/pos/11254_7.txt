********** If you're a fan of BROASTED CHICKEN ....... This is \"The Place\" ***********\n\nI did a Google search for Broasted Chicken ....... I came across the Manufacturer  of the Broasters .... Walla ..... I discovered The Saddle Bronc.\n                   http:\/\/www.broaster.com\/slocator.htm\n\nThe Chicken was scrumptious ....... I had the 2 piece with 2 sides ($8.99).\nThey permitted me to eliminate the Wing ..... thus I had 2 breasts .... with no up-charge.\n\nThey've got a bunch of other choices on the menu ..... along with 30 different Drafts on tap.\n\nArrived at 6:30pm we were seated immediately ....... they already had a nice crowd.\nSince this was Saturday ...... Live Band ....... began at 8pm.\n\n The wait staff were exceptionally Friendly ...... a real nice plus.
