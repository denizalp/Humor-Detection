I was excited to try this place because the pictures looked great however it left me a little disappointed. I took a seat at the bar while I waited for a table during a busy Sunday brunch. Service was good and I ordered a Terrace Bellini which was fantastic. After a little while, the table was ready so we were sat in the dining area. I ordered the red velvet waffle with fried chicken (which I had eyed hungrily while sitting at the bar with order after order of these going out) and my girlfriend ordered a build your own omelette with vegetables. My food arrived but it was a little cold and not as good as I had hoped. The chicken skin wasn't crispy but had good flavor. I tasted my girlfriend's omelette and it tasted like they hadn't used any salt at all. This place definitely has potential but they need to work on their execution.
