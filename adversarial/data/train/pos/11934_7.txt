Finally got a chance to try this place out with the Burger Brigade last night, and it was worth the wait.\n\nExcellent service from the staff, making sure that we were satisfied and very friendly. Nice seating areas as well. \n\nI tried the homemade chili (very nice, more of a tex-mex type of chili), sweet potato fries, poutine, mac & cheese, and quinoa veggie salad. I especially enjoyed the quinoa salad - I haven't had quinoa a lot but this gave me a good idea of how to make it at home! It's rare that a burger joint has truly 'healthy' fare so I was impressed.\n\nFor the burger, I tried the Hole-E Skirt burger and the greek burger. These are massive burgers so make sure you come with a big appetite!! I loved the cheese skirt but I think over all I enjoyed the Greek burger better...it was really good! \n\nWe finished off with a cookie ice cream sandwich and vanilla milkshake....I barely had room for anything else but I had to try both and neither disappointed. In fact, I'm still full this morning! haha. :) Worth the drive to Bolton, but don't despair...they are opening a location in Toronto in the spring!
