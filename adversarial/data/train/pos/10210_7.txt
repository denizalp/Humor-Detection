I loved this Escape Room. \n\nA little history about this place first. Lost Games Escape Rooms was created by a group of friends who fell in love with Escape Rooms. They decided to take what they loved about them, and create their own. Their passion and love for the business is evident in the entire experience. From the introduction story down to the room design. \n\nThe Asylum is fun, tricky and very unique with it's puzzles. Something else I love is how they give hints here. They give them in tricky riddles that you have to solve yourself in order to help you figure out a puzzle. Some escape rooms I've done the hints are literally just directions on what to do next. Come on! I want a hint, not you to solve it for me! This place is great about not doing that. \n\nThe room is immersive but still theatrical and fun. The story line is cohesive and exciting. I can't wait till they open up another room!
