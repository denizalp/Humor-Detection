I have to start this out by, WARNING FAT AND AVERAGE SIZED PEOPLE. YOU WILL BE UNCOMFORTABLE THE ENTIRE SHOW. PLEASE BUY A TABLE IN THE BACK OR DON'T GO. \n\nI enjoyed the show. I really, really enjoyed the show. But both my husband and I were desperate to leave and almost didn't make it through the show because of how uncomfortable the seats were. I'm not a size 2. I was slammed in between two people in a folding patio chair. Lemme just say, the guy beside me owes me $20 for the lapdance I gave him during the show. I was literally in his lap because there is no space. \n\nSo fat and average sized people.....don't say I didn't warn you.
