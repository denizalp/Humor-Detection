Went here for a friend's birthday dinner. Eight people. \n\nClean, space looks great, brightly-lit. The grill is tiny for a table of six! We made a reservation for ten people so we can all eat together. That's the whole point of a birthday dinner right? They gave us two separate tables of six. How awkward to shout over another table to tell a joke heh.  \n\nI dislike how every. single. time. I try to show up fashionably late to any friends' gathering, I somehow manage to always be the first one there! Dinner starts at 8? Cool, I'll get there at 8:15 because I know how slow everyone else is. No dice, they get there at 8:20. Oh geez. So I'm stuck there sipping water as I pretend I'm a bored housewife.\n\nAnyway. We decide as a part of a group to get the Couples' Special and the Woonam choice. That was split and enough for the five of us that decided to share. \n\nFOOD: \nAll the meats were flavorful and delicious. Kalbi was the star of the show. The grill at a table of six was pretty small though. They didn't turn on the fan for the whole meal until the very end. We didn't realize they even had one until it started! Who else like meat perfume? \n\nPerfectly seasoned and each piece of meat was like butter after cooked. Smooth and good choice. Marbled meat was pretty. Pork belly was salty enough on its own, but a bit overpowering with slight extra seasoning.\n\nSERVICE: For the whole meal, we had to flag down our server. They checked up on us maybe a couple times during the beginning, but stopped coming for the rest.\n\nWe asked for water twice. Didn't come back for 15 minutes until we asked again. Important to note that it was not busy for the time of night. We were the only table on one side of the restaurant with plenty of servers abound. \n\nWe received only one soy bean soup, and they forgot to give us the other one. When we asked for it, the server acted surprised and said that it must have been served at another table. No \"sorry\" whatsoever even in korean. We never got our second soup for the entirety of our meal.\n\nWhen we went to pay, we all pulled out our cards\/cash to split the bill. Note that we did NOT ask for separate checks. The cashier looked irritated, sighed loudly and said in korean to her co-worker: \"Oh my god. What a hassle!\" My friend (birthday girl, mind you) just paid it all in cash to make it easier for them. Wow.  \n\nVERDICT: Great food. Horrible service. I wouldn't come back based on service alone. Not so sure I would want to come back to a place when workers talk about you behind your back in another language when we politely ask for the food\/drinks we're paying for.
