Where else can you get fresh lemon grass, fresh pork uterus, and avocado ice cream?  Asian markets are the bomb, but Lee Lee's is the BOMB DIGGETY since they have EVERYTHING.  Jamaican, Cuban, Vietnamese, Korean, Indian, Lebanese---you name it.\n\nIf you love to cook (and I do, I really do!) you can seriously spend hours here.  \n\nONE CAVEAT:  The seafood is fresher and better at 99 Ranch on 44th St. in Phoenix.\n\nLast week, they were giving a 10% discount off of your grocery bill and a free bottle of fish sauce or soy sauce.  If you spent over a certain amount, you got a big bag of rice.\n\nGo!  Now!\n\nAnd have lunch in the Vietnamese restaurant attached.
