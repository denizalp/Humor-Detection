We've always liked Joe's Crab shack and the one at the Mills is really loud so we decided to try this one. Anyways, it's the normal looking Joe's with merchandise to buy. The music isn't blasting so it was better and better atmosphere to eat at. The servers dance as usual for all the customers every once in awhile. \n\nTo start off, we had the Classic Sampler which included fried calamari, Jalapeno balls, Tortilla chips with a Crab dip. The calamari was okay and the Jalape√±o balls had a really nice kick to it and the crab dip was pretty good. Nothing great. Nothing to write home about. Also, my wife and son ordered the clam chowder. They always have to try everyone's chowder. This was probably the most disappointing chowder. I tried it and it didn't have a lot of taste plus it was luke warm. Not good. \n\nFor dinner, I had the Artic Bay Steampot. It had Lobster, Crab legs, Shrimp, Sausage, potatoes, and corn on the cob. It was okay. Not a lot of taste. At the middle of my meal, everything was cold. Not a real fan. Seafood was okay. The sausage seemed like it had a hard skin and wasn't very tasty. The best part of the meal was the corn in the cob. \n\nMy wife had the Spaghetti Lobster. It was served cold. So she didn't eat it. Wasn't at all impressed. \n\nThe manager came by to ask us about our food and we told him that the clam chowder and spaghetti lobster was cold when we got it. He apologize and took it off our bill. Plus he gave use a few coupons for free appetizers. \n\nSo as you can see, we didn't have a very pleasant experience today. Food was so so and cold. Not impressed at all. If we do ever come back, it probably won't be for a long time cause there's just too many place to try. Good Luck at this place.
