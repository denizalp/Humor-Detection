A huge mall smack dab in the middle of downtown Toronto ain't too bad. Almost every major American and Canadian retailer you can think of has a place in here and independent shops as well. \n\nIt is hard to miss this mall and not go in there because it is huge! If you're visiting from the States, I wouldn't recommend buying anything unless you really have to because every brand name item in there is at least 2 times the price of what you'll normally see, even after sale. The inside is quite nice, especially the glass ceiling and the Canadian flag hanging makes it look more symbolic. I recommend looking from the north side of the 3rd floor of the mall, which is where all the higher-end stores (Juicy Couture, Stuart Weitzman, Williams-Sonoma, Sears [if that's considered HE]). \n\nStop by once if you're visiting, don't stop by if you're from around. The layout of the mall is really nice but unless you like indoor shopping, you can find these stores all over.
