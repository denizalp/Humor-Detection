What a wonderful small business that has opened up on the Westside! I'm not sure about other times, but our visit was very.. French lol. We were probably the only non-French speakers in the restaurant at the time, which added to the cafe's charm. Although I was too full to order a dessert crepe, my husband and I each got a galette. They were both filling and tasty, but my unrefined American palette would prefer more sauce (or ketchup lol) so it doesn't taste too dry. I would highly recommend getting a smoothie with your order; the smoothie we ordered was so refreshing and had a nice balance of greens and sweetness from the fruit. The owner was very accommodating and checked on us and other tables often. Prices are very reasonable for the quality of food you get.
