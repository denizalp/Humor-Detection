\"Gritty\" is the word that comes to mind when I think of Conspire. It's not your typical art gallery, if you can call it a gallery at all. It reminded me of a run-down college rental, complete with a makeshift kitchen.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I appreciate all genres of art and the effort that goes into Conspire. I'd like to see more development with the work. Maybe an installation piece...
