Fantastic!! This place really made you feel like you were visiting in Italy! Not as much from the atmosphere, it was really a modern style restaurant that I don't picture in old world Italy, but definitely in how they treated their guests! Everyone was family. \nI visited with my coworkers on a Wednesday evening. We had a party of 17 that trickled in over a period of about an hour. We all started outside with Eric at the bar. Talk about great service!! He was a star for all of us. Kept glasses full, shared refreshing drink recipes for the summer heat and handled our group with professionalism and humor. Just how we like it!\nOnce everyone arrived and had sufficient time to share a cold one, we went inside to begin the dinner service. We did require a shift in the table set up but nothing a few minutes and musical chairs didn't fix. After that, appetizers and drinks were ordered and promptly delivered. I think we tried almost every appetizer and I didn't hear anyone complain. I quite enjoyed the fried calamari. It was crisp, light and a good assortment of tentacles and bodies. Bread was also brought out for us to enjoy. \nI asked our server for his suggestion of a pasta entree. He said that the pappardelle bolognese is one of the most popular dishes along with the pasticcio al forno. His favorite was the pasticcio al forno but I quite enjoy the fresh pappardelle noodle so I chose that instead. After drinks, apps and bread, the portion of the pasta was perfect. Not too much and the sauce was seasoned very well. Some bolognese comes off very sweet or the meat mixture can be heavy but this was quite good. Not overpowering in any direction. \nI'd definitely like to visit again with friends or family!
