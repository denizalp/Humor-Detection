I feel totally ripped off by Verve Dental.  They assured me that my insurance covered two cleaning\/checkup appointments each calendar year, fully paid, no deductible applied.  My bad, I suppose, for not double-checking.  Now they insist I pay $230 for the crappy cleaning they did (I get the real work done in Mexico and my dentist there told me I needed a cleaning...shortly after I'd received a cleaning at Verve.  He held the mirror and showed me the accumulated plaque).  I supposed I'm also paying for the 30-second check up by the dentist who simply looked in my mouth and said \"all's well\".   I'd like to have a dental office that checks my benefits before (over)charging me.  Anyone know of one?  I won't be returning to Verve.
