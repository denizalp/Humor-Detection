I accompanied my daughter to her friend Maya's 5th birthday party recently and we both had a blast... Not only were we surrounded by her friends and preschool classmates (and their parents), but Matt the Magician put on quite the show...\n\nMatt was engaging and entertaining for everyone (both kids and adults). \nI'm not sure who laughed more!  His tricks were fabulous - he definitely put on one of the best magic shows I've seen and my daughter is already asking if Matt can come to her party!  (Maybe next year?!)\n\nIf you're looking for entertainment at a kids party or get-together, Matt will not disappoint!
