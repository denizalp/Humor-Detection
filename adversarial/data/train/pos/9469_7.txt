One of the better places in Chinatown for traditional Chinese food.  Popular spot with the late night clubbing crowd.  The food is consistently good, but overpriced.  Friendly staff and fast and efficient service.  It can get busy at times but the wait won't be long.\n\nWatch out for Big Boss who only works the night shift.  He has a mean look that means business and staff is visibly scared of him.  He rules from behind the cash register with an iron fist and does not hesitate shortchanging you if you show any sign of inebriation.  MAKE SURE YOU CHECK YOUR BILL IF BIG BOSS IS BEHIND THE CASH REGISTER.  Payment is cash only.  If you find a discrepancy (trust me you will) DO NOT argue with Big Boss.  Just casually mention it to your waiter when Big Boss is not looking and he will re-adjust your bill.  You have to be very tactful because Big Boss sees EVERYTHING.  Do not fcuk with Big Boss.\n\nThe hot & sour soup is pretty good.  So are the sizzling plates and beef with blackbean sauce.  The portions are large and can be shared between two people.  The restaurant was cited for violations and closed a while ago, but the cleanliness is likely at par with other joints in the area.  I have personally eaten at this place many times and taken many people with me, and no one got sick. The dishes are over-priced but with so few choices of good food in the area, where else can you eat?
