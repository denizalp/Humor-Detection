I usually get the hot stone bulgogi (bibimbap). I've had the galbi before and it was delicious. The meats are seasoned very well. Even the condiments were good. What I like about the hot stone bulgogi is that it comes with an egg and I like poking the yolk and have it drip into my rice. The hot stone is sizzling hot so be careful that you don't burn yourself because I burned my arm :\/ (I was too excited for my food).\n\n\nWanted to update my review and give it a 5 star. The staff is very attentive and they're so cute. The food is so good. One of the best bibimbaps in Arizona.
