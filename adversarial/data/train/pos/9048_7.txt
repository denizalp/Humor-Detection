Revisited this Dollarama in Place Vertu recently and they now have self serve machines (like the ones you find in some supermarkets). As with other Dollaramas, they also now accept credit cards and debit cards.\n\nThis is why I've upgraded my 4 star review to a 5 star review. Everything else in my earlier review still applies.
