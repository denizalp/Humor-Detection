Am I not remembering this place correctly? The view was spectacular from the outside patio, the drinks were delicious and moderately priced for Vegas, and the bartenders were cute. \n\nBut the music, oh the music. Nelly videos don't really seem \"high-end club\" appropriate. The decor is so beautiful and so zen, and the music is about Bentleys and hos. The juxtaposition is more jarring than welcomed. \n\nThe crowd was also very, very strange. There seemed to be a bar crawl of foreigners who's idea of hitting on a girl was to tell her that she's tall. Before that were a group of middle aged couples getting freaky to Missy Elliot on the dance floor. It's an interesting time and worth the visit if you don't have to pay a cover.
