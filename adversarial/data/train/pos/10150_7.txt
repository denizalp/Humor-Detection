Frankly I don't have a lot of experience with party limo's to compare to my experience with @viptransport_LV .\n\nI have flashbacks every time I think about this night, and my ears ring at just the hint of a party limo.\n\nBut the service was fine, the limo was certainly a party atmosphere...although I've never been in a club quite so packed.  There was champagne flowing, people drinking out of the bottles, blasting music, flashing lights, flesh on flesh...not for the faint of heart.  You see, the limo seated like 24 and we packed in 31 at one point.  We probably should have stopped inviting random Vegas vacationers into the limo but what the hell.\n\nAt the end of the first ride I couldn't feel my legs.  Just packed in that tight...\n\nSo as far as the service...we got to and from our destinations, we got a party, we got what we paid for just fine.  A-Ok three stars.\n\nUgh.  Vegas.
