OK. This is it people. This is why we are here. Right? This is the time of year we phone relatives back home, donned in flip flops, board shorts and Ray Bans. We say things like, \"Ohhhh, I forgot it's 32 degrees, snowing, sleeting and you have dark dismal clouds looming overhead.\" \"I'm by the pool flipping burgers in my new swim suit I got at Marshall's\" (ok, I wouldn't reveal that, I would say Saks 5th Ave., but work with me people!). Even though we're still \"struggling\" with these unseasonal temps (a la upper 80s's), our relatives, friends and family we left behind are snuckering down (did I say snuckering?) in their moon boots and parkas. Us? We? We're still chillin' in our favorite T's, shorts and sandals. The point for this review? Hmmmm. to review us. To review the weather. And the jab at the rest of the good ole US of A. I know Phoenix is waiting for a heartbeat. I know there are newbies who don't get us yet. And that's ok.  I feel the energy of the desert. I feel the energy of a new city emerging from the ashes. I feel the uncomfortableness from this nasty ass IKEA chair on my butt. While I know it's time to sign off and find comfort elsewhere, I just had to say....I LOVE Phoenix and if you don't, go somewhere else, drop the negativity and find your mojo within yourself!
