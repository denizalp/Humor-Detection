Love this place. Total chick magnet, from the purse trees to the pink accents on the cloth napkins, menus and our server's tie. Pretty, well-made cocktails, but not as strong as I would like, but then again, I never met anyone would likes their drinks as strong as I do. I only tried the soup, and it was amazing. Just a lot of complimentary textures and flavours going on. My friends ordered various appetizers, main and dessert and everything smelled and looked amazing. I'm planning on returning to try the food and give a more detailed review. Great service. Make sure you ask about the food, the menu description does not do it justice.
