Presto! Voila! Houdini's was a nice little find for some unique souvenirs for my son. There's a ton of magic tricks, booklets and books to choose from cheap to the more expensive. It was easy to put together a magic primer batch of a few cheesy tricks. And the tricks have little Skill Levels on them, so you know what you're getting into!\n\nThe three guys working the counter here were goofy and having fun, which makes the store a relaxed visit. They were hands off, mostly, but quick to help when asked a question and friendly during checkout. Now, I wonder if I'll have a li'l Houdini on my hands...I hope so!
