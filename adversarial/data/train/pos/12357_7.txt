This big o is shady don't deal with them.  I bought 4 tires 3 months ago with tire protection plan. One of my tires blew out, a couple days ago so I took it in to get replaced under warranty.  They didn't have the tire so they had to order from another store for me to pick up at 1:30 or two however when I picked up the tire they try to charge me $33 you have to pay for labor and a disposal fee of 4.44 and a new tire protection plan.   This is where I get pissed!  I would not buy a warranty unless everything was said to be covered.  16.95 to mount my tire on the rim. My car wasn't even there I saved them time and no discount. I was trying to work down the price because the manager did not tell me I would have to pay for the tire.  So the tire warranty is 11.50, I ask them to take off the warranty on that tire.  The sleepy mechanic tells me no that I have to buy a warranty, and they are not aloud to give me my damn tire back because \"it's an EPA thing I can't give it back because you'll go throw it in a dumpster or alley!\" I leave after paying the money and my girlfriend gets pissed call them. They deny the whole thing and tell me I can get my money back but only on the warranty.  These guys are dirtbags don't deal with them.
