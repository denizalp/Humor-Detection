Service was friendly, the establishment was clean.\n\nThe menu is primarily poke based, but upon seeing that they had elote in a cup, I was very excited.\n\nFor only $1.55 a pop, it came in a good sized container for 1.5 people.\nInside, it carried charred corn which was nice, the melted cheese was an interesting mix despite it not having the normal cotija, it had some of the red powder which idr, .. there was mayo involved, and a sprig of cilantro, BUT IT WAS MISSING A VERY IMPORTANT INGREDIENT: the lime! \nWhat I'm used to is bbqed corn slathered in butter, mayo, cotija cheese, the red powder and lime juice, so this was a departure from home.\n\nI'm really sad that I didn't try it while I was there, otherwise I would have said something. What would have been a 4 star review shot down to two. There was no acidity whatsoever, just pure creaminess - I was a sad panda.
