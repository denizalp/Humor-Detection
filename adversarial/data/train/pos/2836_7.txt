I'm happy for the one person who likes this place but honestly my biggest problem is that out of $500 deposit I got back $2.33! They painted every wall in the place. I was there for one year, I didn't put up art and I don't have a kid to draw on the walls. Why did they spend half of my deposit to paint the walls?!? If they even did, its not like I could verify that it was actually done. That's why Pala Mesa sucks. Also, they're in the ghetto, just FYI, and they're expensive as hell for the location. Light rail sure, but also hooker motels, tweaker trailer parks and constant police copters overhead looking for criminals in the area.
