I just had the BEST conversation with an elderly gentleman at the register while waiting for a barista to acknowledge me. One was on the phone (business phone but obviously a personal call) while two stood in the drive thru chatting.\n6 minutes ticked by while I waited.... The guy in the picture was done with his transaction and we just really got into how he loves those muffins. We even had time to discuss how they could be frozen and how many calories etc. I have to say he was a delight.\nAfter we exhausted our chit chat he started to leave and I'm still standing there... Just waiting, hoping, getting annoyed. Finally one of the baristas comes over from the drive thru and says \"did you need something?\" I'm so glad she asked!! I mean it would be weird if I was just stood here all this time and didn't need a thing.\nI replied a tad snarkily that I hoped I wasn't interrupting the baristas phone call and she told me sweetly \"oh, you're not! She talks and works all the time!\"\nSo I left. Because who needs a $5 tea from a Starbucks who can barely get it together?\nI'd recommend that you go elsewhere. There is a Starbucks literally across the street, and one a mile away on Valle Verde that has fantastic baristas.\nOh, and to the girl on the phone... I snapped a picture I'm posting below. I really hope you figured out what your after work plans were.
