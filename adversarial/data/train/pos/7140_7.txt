Sexy elegant hotel. Wynn resorts did this hotel right. Its been since NYE 2009 that I have stayed overnight as a guest. As a local, I rarely stay in a resort, but on special occasions I make an exception. Theres a lot of magic happening right now. \n\nThe rooms are so beautiful. I love the floor to ceiling mirrors and the luxurious beds. The beds are so comfortable, you want to sleep forever. The light situation in the room is a bit awkward. It never did exactly what I had wanted, so had to adjust all the lights manually. There are complimentary robes, plush towels and lots of nice toiletries.\n\nBeware: Valet overnight was a whopping $27! Yikes! I believe thats the most expensive so far I have heard of on the strip. Way too high, there should be a discount for either spending or gambling with  validation of course. Thats my only issue. Other than that, I love the resort.
