I came here because it was new. I took advantage of their grand opening promo - $2.99 deluxe milk tea - as posted on their front shop banner. The cost is for a regular and it consists of pudding, grass jelly & lychee jelly (weird!). I was unimpressed by the wait time, thought it'd be something they can serve fast since it is the promoted drink, but nope I waited 10 min for it. Don't even get me started on how slow and inexperienced the guys making the drinks are (sorry!). Unimpressed at the amount of flavoured powders they have on the counter (I mean, competition's fierce, no authentic flavours? you can't do that anymore), therefore unimpressed and turned down by their drink choices. \n\nLastly, unimpressed with the guys' attitude about their neighbouring competition with regards to their grand opening. I know it's all for jokes, but they would confront friends of customers coming over from Chatime to join their friends and ask them \"How's the business over there? Not busy? That's what I like to hear!\" Bleh. If that's the morale they want hold for opening up this shop, I'm just unimpressed. (PS: do u know why you see Chatime cups in your store and not vice versa? Your wait times are so long they would never make it there!)\n\nI was really considering the Boba bottle. I asked and can verify, indeed, if you return with the bottle you get $1 off your drink, making it the cost of a large. \"The bottle is slightly bigger than the large\". From experience, I'm not very consistent with bringing back 'loyalty' items to benefit from the hook. Am I really going to wash it, keep it in my car, repeat, all summer long, just for that slight discount? Just ponder upon that. Oyea, and in the end, my cup wasn't even filled full. Sad face. With Chatime, CoCo, LaTea, etc. nearby, I don't think I'll come back here unless I'm strongly persuaded to.. Although the bogo cake slices are quite attractive so I might actually return for that... with a Chatime IN HAND!!!
