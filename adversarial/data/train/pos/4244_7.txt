I have been back here a few more times since that initial visit and I have to say that they are winning me over!\n\nI sold an item on Ebay and was ill prepared to have my item sent out. Michael greeted me as I walked in the door and assisted me right away! All I had to do was drop off the item, leave the specs, and make payment and thy took care of the rest!\n\nI think I may have been quick to judge the last time and now I can say I will be back more in the future! What a great staff!\n\n4 stars!
