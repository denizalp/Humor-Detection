My last 2 visits to El Jalapeños have been nothing short of crap!\nService was painfully slow on both visits.  Neither time was the place terribly busy with customers.  My friend's margarita was nothing but margarita-mix syrup.  If you can't get a good margarita at a Mexican place.....\nMy sangria was out of a box.   *See same comment about where one should be able to fine a quality sangria.  \nThe food was BLAND!  As a vegetarian I asked if the rice was cooked in chicken stock.  The server looked at me like I was a moron.  When I explained why I asked that question, I was snapped at: \"NO!\"\nI've never had problems here before, but when there are SO many quality Mexican restaraunts in the area, I will not be going back to El Jalapeños ever again.
