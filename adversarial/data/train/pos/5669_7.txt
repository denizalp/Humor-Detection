Originally, I gave this place a 5 star review. The place is clean and they do have good artists. \n\nI was out of town for business for several months and recently called to see if my regular artist was available. Their usual counter girl apparently isn't there any more which makes me sad because she was rad. Not sure who the new person is that books appointments but she's rude. There are MANY other tattoo shops in town where I will gladly spend my money. \n\n\nSo, I decided to consider that maybe she was having a bad day. That's not the case. I went down there on a Wednesday to see if they had info as to the new shop where my regular tattooer went to and to book a separate appointment with one artist there because of what he specializes in. The woman who was at the counter barely looked at me and was rude. She acted like it was a huge bother to even talk. \n\n\nCome to also find out that my regular artist isn't there anymore and they are purposely telling his clients that they don't know what shop he's at out of unprofessional spite. \n\nNo thanks. I've been getting tattooed for over 20 years and would rather stick with good people with CUSTOMER SERVICE SKILLS and PROFESSIONALISM.
