One word... Pathetic\n\nThis has to be the worst beer bar I've ever been to.  I've actually seen Ciro's listed as a top 10 beer bar in certain articles over the years and always had it in the back of my mind to try it.  Boy...was that a mistake.  They had 4-5 boring tap beers (Wellington and something else) and the beer fridge had a weak collection of maybe 7-8 beers with no European imports.  I ended up with a Dragon Stout from Jamaica which was so disgusting I couldn't finish it. The fridge didn't even keep the beer cold.\n\nAs bad as the beer collection was the crowd.  Nobody was there on a Saturday night except 4-5 people by the bar there who looked like they just got out of prison and reeked of urine.  One of the drunk loud guys had a switch blade hanging from his jeans and large unkeep dogs chained up outside. The place reeked of cigarettes, the d√©cor was terribly dated, and it was filled of degenerates.  This place needs to close down ASAP.  I have no idea how they stay open.
