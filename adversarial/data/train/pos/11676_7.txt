I was not a huge Backstreet Boys fan, I like their music but it just wasn't my generation.\nSome family came to town and wanted to go, I will never refuse seeing a show, so I tagged along.\nIt was a spectacular production from beginning to end. The place was packed with screaming fans.\n They used the whole stage, great dancers, even kept us entertained during intermission. \nOur seats were pretty far back but we could still see very well.\nDrinks were well made but pricey, not suprised.\nYou will enjoy this show whether you are a fan or not. See them here while you can!
