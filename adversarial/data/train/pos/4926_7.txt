This review is for the amazingly brilliant Optician Lovejeet, but when you give someone a title it limits them and she is so much more.\n\n     This is my first time needing spectacles  for ailing eyesight but being a self-proclaimed SunGlassSnob, I already had several pairs of nice frames which I had taken to LensCrafters in the mall by my house the guy made it all so mysterious, putting lenses with my prescription in them possibly couldn't be done, I was being sold in buying new frames which were the same flagship brand they sold. \n\n    I have made it a hard fast rule if something's going to cost me more than 300.00 dollars, I get three opinions or estimates, and wait thee days. \n\n     So when I went into eyeglass world for BoGFree or two  pairs for the price of one, I was just hoping the person didn't talk down to me because glasses are mysterious it's not the newest offices, locations & facilities but it didn't matter to me because I had gone two three stores costco nothing fit my style, one pair at the huge optical brand stores in the mall was going to cost three times more and then I found Lovejeet, she made it alright she took care of everything what a great place they are lucky to have her and I will go back when I need more glasses because of Lovejeet, she treated me like a true professional.
