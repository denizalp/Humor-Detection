Attended a private party hosted by a good friend of mine here during the G2E convention last week.  It was held on the patio overlooking the Strip.  It was catered buffet style and had a hosted open bar.....sweet!\n\nOn the buffet they had Pizza, Empinadas, Beef & Chicken Kabobs, and a bunch of other stuff I can't remember right now.  On the Dessert buffet there was a large selection of Cheesecakes.....again, I can't remember.  The hosted bar got the best of me.....I guess that's what happens when you drink several classes of Wine, ha!\n\nThe patio was awesome with a great view of the Strip.  The club staff was very friendly and the weather was perfect!  The DJ was playing a combination of funky house and hip-hop.....I wish he would have stuck with the funky house....but it was a pretty good vibe nonetheless since it wasn't that angry gangsta hip-hop.\n\nThe booths and cabanas were comfortable as they each had heaters although it wasn't too cold.  I actually had to ask a bouncer to shut off the heater in our cabana.\n\nOverall it was a great night of partying and networking.\n\nWill I return?  For a private party....you bet I will!
