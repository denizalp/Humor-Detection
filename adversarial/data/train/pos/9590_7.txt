Spicy Chicken Chipotle Pasta FTW! \nIt's mother\/daughter date night and Hunnie Bunnie has picked this place again after having the Bow Tie Pasta in Marinara sauce last time. They should really take reservations because this place ALWAYS has a wait AND the waiting area gets CROWDED. \nThe wait is 25-30 minutes. 28 minutes later our pager goes off - It's go time! \nTonight Im starting with a glass of Prosecco. It's not as sweet as I would like so totally not ordering THIS again... I told our server I didn't like it and she was just kind of like Ooohkay... \nWe start with a bowl of New England Clam Chowder and their complimentary table bread served with little pats of cold butter. It would be better if the butter was actually spreadable but whatevez. The soup is in an ENORMOUS bowl and pretty tasty. We ate about half and had the rest packed up.\nChicken Chipotle Pasta for me it is! SO delish!! Perfect amount of spiciness that doesnt take away from the flavor of the dish - I love all the veggies mixed in with the pasta too along with the tortilla strips. I could probably just drink the sauce and be totally satisfied. Twice in the past I have tried a different pasta only to be disappointed so I'm just gonna stick with this WINNER! \nHunnie Bunnie is getting her Bow Tie Pasta in Marina Sauce (meatless) and she obviously loves it - she says it is her FAVORITE!\nSo about mid-meal a very nice manager comes over and asks me about the Prosecco. I just told him it wasnt sweet enough to my liking and he took it away and OFF my bill :)\nThe Cheesecake is DELICIOUS of course as well! Rich and creamy and NOMTASTIC! Ask for no whip cream if you're not into it.
