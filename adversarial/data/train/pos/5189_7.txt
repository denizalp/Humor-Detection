Sweet Marie? More like Cranky Phyllis.\n\nThis is my least favourite convenience store in Toronto. Their hours are wonky and they close far too early. More like inconvenient store. Hashtag burn. \n\nI can't tell if the staff hates me or dogs more, I think it's dogs because they once had a sign up that read \"$10,000 fine for bringing in your dog.\" Which is completely untrue, unless they personally plan on fining me, which means they hate me more than the pup. I've confused myself, but one things is for sure: they dislike me. And dogs. \n\nI'm giving them two stars instead of one, because, well, I don't hate it enough to walk any farther in the winter when dog sitting in the east end, so it can't be thaaaat bad.
