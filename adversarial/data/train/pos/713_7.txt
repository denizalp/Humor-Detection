Most people probably do not know this; New York Fries in spite of its name they are proudly Canadian! \n\nThe potato fries are so good you can eat them all by them selves, I of course prefer them with a little ketchup! But my favorite item on their menu is the poutine combo with a drink. Like a typical Canadian I love poutine! There are a few places that can do it right, and for a fast food chain I have to say that this place does poutine very well. This is a simply meal, however, if you don't use the right ingredients in the right combination it is also very easy to get it wrong. As this meal is available almost everywhere, we all have our favorite spots. for me New York Fries really nails the taste, texture, and combination of this dish. \n\nIf you have not tried the poutine here, I really recommend you try it. As I have said this dish is available almost everywhere and we all have our favorite spots, however this place really has a good poutine. I recommend it.
