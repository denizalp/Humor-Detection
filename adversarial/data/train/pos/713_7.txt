I have heard good stuff about the 800 Degrees franchise, but unfortunately my experience at this SLS 800 Degrees Neapolitian Pizzeria was sub par. \n\nI ordered the Hawaiian pizza from the man behind the counter. Fresh out of the oven, the pizza was wet and soggy. The crust was not crispy at all. I might give 800 Degrees another chance next time I am in Vegas, but as of now I am not impressed.
