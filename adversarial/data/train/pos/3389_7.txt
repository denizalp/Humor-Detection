I had high hopes for this restaurant. It's been over ten years since I've been to Red Robin. Out of all the restaurants on Stapley I decided to choose Red Robin....I regret it. What a waste of 20 minutes.  \n\nA hostess sat us down and then we waited 10 minutes and decided to leave. Horrible service. No server ever came to our table to grab our drinks. \n\nPeople around us even looked upset. I'm glad I decided to walk out. On our way out nobody even acknowledged us. \n\nManagement needs some review. \n\nBeware and good luck! :)
