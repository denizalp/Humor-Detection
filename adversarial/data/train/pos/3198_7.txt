I was an employee and very disgusted in how they treat employees. Glad I quit and am no longer there. \n\nBehind the scenes, you would be very interested to know how they do business. It's a joke. \n\nI'm with another bank whose culture aligns more with what I am looking for and believe in. The difference is astounding! \n\nPlease do not support this bank who treats employees the way they do! Horrible!
