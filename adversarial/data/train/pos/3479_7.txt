Have you ever wanted to feel like Buzz Lightyear?  Literally... you could go to infinity, and beyond.  Especially when you are in fact buzzed and NOT drunk (that would be bad).  To get there, ziplining across Fremont Street's seizure inducing ceiling lights will do just that.\n\nFellow buddy Francis C. ended up having some free passes for us to catch a ride across this zipline.  I've done ziplining before, but never one where it was over a crowd of drunken tourists in a city of neon lights.  To say I was stoked is a complete understatement.  There are a lot of ways to get reduced tickets\/free passes for the zipline, so be sure to ask your hotel or travel agent to see if they can hook it up.\n\nKeep these in mind when you are preparing to zipline across Fremont Street:\n1. Leave your larger personal belongings with your friends or in a locker.  There are pouches provided that are latched onto you for your smaller items (phones, cameras, etc.) but there is always a slight chance it may fall while you're riding down.\n2. You're going to be on your gluteus maximus as you zip down.  Fellas, your package IS going to be a bit tight, so be ready for some pushing.\n3. Avoid being smashed.  You don't want to projectile vomit on the civilians below you.\n\nAside from that, strap on tight and enjoy the ride.  At the end of the zipline, a photographer will be there to capture your final moments.  We had a ball going down, even after signing away our lives in case the strap comes loose.  However, this ride is very safe, and is not scary at all.  I think the swirling tea cups at Disneyland are more prone to sickness than this.\n\nMake sure you get a friend to snap some shots while you're going down!  It'll make for some epic Yelp profile pics.
