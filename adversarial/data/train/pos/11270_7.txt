A little better overall.  \n\nI went here again at the request of my wife today, and I was curious if there was going to be any improvement in this place since my last, horrible visit.  I can definitely say that the customer service was FAR FAR better--someone actually asked me if I needed help!  That was good.  The place felt quite a bit more alive than the last time I was here.  A recent review of this place by another Yelper described it as \"a tomb.\"  Last time I was here, yes.  This time, at least at the time I visited, no.\n\nBut let's cut to the chase--the reason why you visit a bookstore is, well, BOOKS!  Customer service only goes so far if what you carry is no good (and this is true for many kinds of businesses.)  I have been to a number of metaphysical stores in my day both in California and Arizona, and this one still stinks in their book selection.  Sure, the fluff sells in bulk and you need to carry it.  But, you need MORE than that.  Either the owner or the book buyer or both need to visit Alpha Book Center, Fantasia, and Northern Winds in Phoenix to find out what kind of inventory a REAL METAPHYSICAL BOOKSTORE really has in stock.  This place has enough space to carry the full book inventory of all three of these stores combined--if it did, they'd get a LOT more business from Wiccans, New Agers, and Occultists of all different stripes who would go there to get the stuff they need.  Bulk herbs would be another nice addition--all they have are the same-old same-old incense sticks and oils.  \n\nInstead of aiming to be a provider to the metaphysical community in the Valley (and this is an ample community), they seem to be relying on their tarot card readers, psychics, authors, presenters, and aura photographers to bring in the bucks.  Good, but not good enough.\n\nA little better overall.  Come on Vision Quest!  You guys have the space and the potential--now DO SOMETHING with it!
