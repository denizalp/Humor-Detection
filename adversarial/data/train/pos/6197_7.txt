The guy who works here is incredibly happy.\n\nHe's got an incredible passion for his work and he's a genuinely nice person. Also, he takes actually ATTRACTIVE passport photos of you! Not the usual mug shot that you usually see. \n\nI came here with my boyfriend and he printed us both an extra photo so we can put our photos in each other's wallets... LOL. \n\nNot to mention the passport photos are SO CHEAP especially compared to Black's? (AKA Umm, the biggest rip off ever.) Photos were done very quick.\n\nOk Ok, the place might seem sketchy when you walk by but don't judge this place by it's cover! It's awesome! Highly recommended :)
