Customer service in Calgary is incredibly sh***y...and that's me being nice...so when I met up with a friend for supper on a business trip I wasn't expecting much..especially from a Milestones...but much to my complete shock and amazement we received some of the best service I have EVER had!!\n\nThe Hostess said that the restaurant was full but we could wait in the lounge..she walked us in and told us the best seat to grab and then waved a server over. The server told us some drink specials...made some of her fave suggestions and took the order...the lounge was super busy and they were a bit under staffed so it took some time for the drink to come. She was very apologetic and when our table was ready she waved the charge on the drinks....????...that's right...they gave them to us because we had to wait...we didn't even complain...it was brilliant!\n\nThe server who helped while dinning was equally fantastic..if not a little over friendly...and had our order to us promptly..I had the mushroom chicken and garlic mashed potatoes and she had a 3 cheese burger and fries...both delicious!\n\nAs we were leaving a bus boy asked us how are evening was and hoped we enjoyed the meal...a bus boy?? Where the hell am I...what do they want from me....I was starting to get paranoid as to why all the staff seemed so nice...were we on some new reality show??\n\nWe went to the hostess to pay and the manager was standing at the door...he too asked how the meal was...now it was getting ridiculous...I told him how amazing everyone was and he should be proud of his staff and that I was actually getting suspicious of the good service...he laughed and said not to worry..it was their pleasure..I seriously had to get my friend to hold me up so I didn't pass out....
