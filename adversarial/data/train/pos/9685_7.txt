I started hearing about this place a few months ago, and then really got intrigued when Fat Heads pulled the Lindemans off tap & switched it to Arsenal.  Last week I picked ~400lbs of pears at the family farm with the intention of making cider, but turns out I don't have much of a clue how to pull it off.  So, I stopped in with the hope that they could point me in the right direction, and they did not disappoint.\n\nBill & Michelle are great people, and I hope their business thrives. I don't have enough cider experience to really sing their praises, but it is very good and easy to drink...but be careful, it can be as strong as wine.  \nTheir establishment is in the bottom half of their house in Lawrenceville, so that alone speaks to their dedication to the craft; they literally live & breathe cider.  Bill was very helpful in giving me some cider-making pointers, so if you're looking to small-batch, stop by, get some advice, and be sure to take home a growler or two.   Come on Yelpers, stop by and buy some cider!
