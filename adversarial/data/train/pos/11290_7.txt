An Art Deco theater, circa 1936! Architecture buffs will appreciate this gorgeous historical cinema. It used to house one giant screen with a couple thousand seats, but was later split up into about half a dozen smaller ones. I always like walking to the upstairs theaters, which used to be the balcony seating. It's currently owned by Cleveland Cinemas, so you do get some independent films here, along with whatever's popular, at the moment. Also, they have beer! Wine, too. Plenty of parking available in the rear (free).
