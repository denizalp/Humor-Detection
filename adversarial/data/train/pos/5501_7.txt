If you want a nice break from the strip, then definitely stay here! All their rooms are so nice and spacious! It's really quite compare to the strip, which is super nice and just what I needed. I stayed over the summer and their pool is amazing! There's little cabana beds in the water, which is nice to sun bathe. \n\nI went gambling downstairs and brought my bottle of wine with me, no one said anything for the longest time, so I thought it was fine. When I was down to my last quarter of the bottle a lady comes up and says \"miss, you're not allowed to be drinking from a bottle\" I laughed out of awkwardness and didn't know what to do. Did she expect me to throw it away? So I kindly said okay I'll go back to the room, but she nicely said just go to the bar and ask for a glass. And that is what I did. So just letting you all know...drinking from the bottle is a no no.\n\nMy favorite part of this hotel would be the wine tasting place. Definitely order the cheese plate!\n\nThey used to have hash house, but I don't believe it's there anymore, which I find disappointing because it was so good! You'll have to head to the strip for that. \n\nThe M buffet is also one of my favorites! I love their breakfast buffet.
