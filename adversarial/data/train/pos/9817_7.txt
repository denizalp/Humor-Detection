Never again.\nI paid 30 bucks for the Wings and Ribs Combo.  The wings were undercooked and almost felt raw, and the ribs tasted like they were boiled.  \nI could only muster up the strength to eat 5 wings, and then the disappointment took over and forced me to put the crappy food aside.\n\nIf you ever find me considering eating from this place again....please cut my fingers off.\n\nIm so pissed right now.\nI hate WIng Machine.
