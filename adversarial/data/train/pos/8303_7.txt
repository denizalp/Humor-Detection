It's a good thing Diego Pops isn't in my hometown. If it was, I'd be there every day stuffing my face with tacos and margaritas, and I'd be 20 pounds heavier.\n\nI came here for lunch on a recent business trip to Scottsdale. It came highly recommended by locals and Yelpers alike. After sitting down in their sunny, inviting patio, I could immediately see why. This place looks like an all-day fiesta. Hoppin' bar; friendly servers; cold beers; fresh guacamole; young, attractive patrons. Who could ask for anything more?!\n\nOur table feasted on their famous Brussels Sprouts nachos; Street Corn Queso; and guacamole and chips. For our entree, you can choose from a variety of tacos featuring fresh ingredients and meat\/chicken\/fish hot off the grill. This place ain't no Taco Bell. It's the real deal. I wound up ordering the Braised Green Chili Chicken Taco which comes with crema, cotija, house slaw on a crispy corn tortilla. I could've eaten 10 of them!\n\nBTW, if you check in on Yelp you can take advantage of a $5 taco\/beer special. \n\nIf you're in the Scottsdale area, I'd highly recommend this spot for an outdoor lunch or happy hour!
