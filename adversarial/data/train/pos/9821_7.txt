TAO nightclub lives up for Vegas. \n\nI got in for free, and got free drinks as well?? As much as I want! The bouncer was nice enough to provide me VIP drinks with the tickets he handed me. I have no idea how I got this, lol. Great music. As a clubber vulture, I live up for this one. This is my 2nd club in Vegas and I had an amazing time. The Asian decors are super astonishing. \n\nI will probably come back here when I'm back to Sin City.
