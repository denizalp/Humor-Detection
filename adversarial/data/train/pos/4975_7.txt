Looks like this place was an old 7-11 at one time. The front has been redone and the inside is simply redecorated. It is more like a small convenience store with the scent of a French bakery in the air.\n\nThey basically have some tables to eat at and some display cases with bakery goods, cheeses, and ready made meals in the cooler section. Very simple with a lot of potential. Seen a lot of people enjoying some French pressed coffee and a treat on the side.\n\nPicked up some some ready cooked New Orleans style Red Beans from the fridge to bring home. Had my eye on some Andouille Gumbo and their Shrimp Etouffee. I wonder if it is as good as mine. Hmmm?\n\nCould not resist getting a Chocolate Eclair and some Praline Bacon. Ok maybe a couple bags of those hard to get tasty Zapps Chips for a midnight snack.\n\nWould like to see more inventory and a larger selection of baked goods. I was expecting a little bit more of a presentation. Did not know you had to cook it at home and not eat it there. Hmmm?\n\nCheck them out and don't forget ... PRALINE BACON RULES !!!
