Two of us came here for brunch this past Saturday.  This was my second visit to this location and it was a great dining experience.\n\nWe ordered the following dishes with their menu descriptions:\n\nKaya toast--SE Asian coconut egg jam, brioche, fried egg, house sweet soy\nFlock frites--curly fries, parmesan, Flock Sauce, herbs\nQuinoa salad with fried cauliflower (added Chinese sausage)--almonds, crispy tofu, sesame vinaigrette\nFried chicken bao--steamed bun slider with chicken\nButtermilk fried chicken Benedict--poached eggs, Hollandaise sauce\nCast iron chocolate chip cookie--freshly baked, vanilla ice cream, miso caramel sauce\n\nIf you go here for brunch, you must try the fried chicken Benedict.  Perfectly cooked poached eggs with excellent Hollandaise.  Another complete winner is the Flock frites.  The sauce is very good and the fries are addictive.  Take a friend or two with you because the serving is very large.  \n\nThe sesame vinaigrette on the quinoa salad was perfect.  The light flavoring allowed the flavors of the quinoa, tofu, and sausage to shine.\n\nFor dessert, the cast iron chocolate chip cookie is a great choice.  The pan was almost clean when we were done!\n\nThe only downside can be parking.  There is plenty there but you have to pay unless you park away and walk.  That's not the fault of Flock & Fowl but the city getting parking revenue from the growing DTLV scene.
