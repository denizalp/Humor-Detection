I came here last night for some Mari Gras fun for the spirit of Fat Tuesday! My husband and I got some complimentary house drinks with a voucher and we watched a duo band. We had a good time watching the show, and we were excited for the main act, Michael Grimm. \n\nThe waiter we had a large nice man who was eager to serve us at first. He came to our tables and gave us the complimentary drinks within a few minutes of us sitting down. After receiving our drinks, the waiter asked suggested a few items on the menu. After telling him of my husband's seafood allergy, he at two points suggested items with shellfish. He seemed to get fed up raving about items that we could not eat, and said \"well then you decide.\" I think he did not understand that some people have allergies or he did not know the menu well enough to suggest items that weren't shellfish. \n\nAnyways, we ended up taking a moment to discover the menu and ordered the basic jambalaya and gumbo. Surprising, he still asked if we wanted to add shrimp. I said the allergy comment again and he seemed to get annoyed. Anyways, we received our delicious shellfish free food and had a pleasant dinner.\n\nI got a portion of my food to go. But for some reason, it took approximately 30 minutes from when we got our to go box to get our check. Maybe the waiter didn't want to pressure us to leave, but he could have asked us if that was the case.\n\nI am giving the place 3 stars simply because of the awkward service. Waiters need to be trained on the menu and common allergies. He was a nice enough guy, but I seem room for improvement. \n\nThe food tasted as it should, nothing spectacular but definitely on point.
