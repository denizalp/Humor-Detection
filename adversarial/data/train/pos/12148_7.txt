Our visit was right before the dinner crowd rush. It was quite upon arrival and we were quickly seated. \n\nWe went with a special that they had for the appetizers (3 for $12) and ordered - stuffed mushrooms, asparagus and lettuce wraps. Those stuffed mushrooms were insanely good.  The mushrooms were not soggy and the sausage on the inside was juicy. The asparagus had a nice crunch and it was prosciutto wrapped so I mean c'mon. The lettuce wraps I would never order again. The meat was cold and I just did not enjoy the flavor at all. They had an oil - I can't remember the name that they gave us to drizzle over the lettuce wraps. The oil itself was good, had a nice kick to it. The server told us it was very spicy and to use it with caution. If you don't eat spicy food I would understand. \n\nMy salad was simply and delicious. The veggies were crisp and very fresh. The man had sausage and lentil soup which was also tasty. I almost wish I had gotten soup over my salad. He killed his bowl too - for a man that doesn't care for lentils. He really enjoyed it. \n\nOur food arrived and my pasta was delicious. The man ordered grilled chicken - I can't remember the exact name of what he got but it was really good as well. Just a small portion of chicken breast.\n\nWe don't do these kind of chains often but it was nice to know that we could go and get solid eats. Our staff was attentive without being overbearing. They treated my kid like a normal patron and didn't \"kid him down\". So that is always a plus for me. And we all left happy and satisfied. This pushes it to 4 stars for me.
