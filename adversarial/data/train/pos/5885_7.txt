I guess you could say we drifted into this place on a cold day. \n\nThe Boss and I were looking for a different meal one day and decided to venture on route 73 to find an open place for a decent meal. When he suggested a truck stop I kind of just laughed it off. But then again growing up in 3 provinces it dawned on me that maybe he was right. \n\nSo we ended up here at a Calgary Mega truck stop and seated in a booth inside Drifters Restaurant. I liked the interior and the feel of the place is like you've just rolled into Calgs from a road trip. There was others dining inside, but just enough. The waitress was very friendly, and would often converse with us. I ordered the veal cutlet, and mashed potatoes and the boss ordered a hamburger with fries. \n\nThe food was tasty, a bit better then the average. Our plates were completely finished. The beer was very cheap, so we had a few. Then I had lemon meringue pie for dessert. The whole experience brought back memories of when I was a waitress at a smaller truck-stop so all the nostalgia was added to every bite. Especially when one of the waitresses sat a booth filling up the sugar bowls.
