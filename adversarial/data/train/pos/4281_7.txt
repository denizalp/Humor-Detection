Having just moved to the area with my resplendent girlfriend, one of my bloodcurdlingly saucy gentleman friends advised we hit Garden Ridge. So we did just that. After hearing of sweet deals and a wide array, of unique and tasteful items I was all about it.\n\nAs I drifted aimlessly through what seemed to an ocean of useless baubles, I thought to myself...\"Hey me, this place is way overpriced for the quality of the stuff available.\" I totally agreed with myself and also admired how sexy my voice was, even when its just in my own head. Just when I thought all was lost...it happened.\n\nOne of the most beautiful lamps I have ever laid eyes upon. I'm not even going to tell you what it was, cause I know you will just bite my style in hopes of being super cool like me. First of all, this is no cake walk sister. Do you know what it like to be so cool that the elderly and small children freeze to death when they come within 20 feet of you? No...didn't think so. What ensued was me trying to build the most heinous lamp I possibly could, while trying not to have my girlfriend murder me. I t truly was the highlight of my garden ridge excursion. And despite her coming close to strangling me to death in front of a woman who I suspected was wearing a fright wig, and cut off sweatpant shorts, I prevailed. Ultra bad-ass night table lamp was born.\n\nA lot useless junk, that they are charging way to much for. If you have some cash to throw around and want to get a few things for your house or garden then go right ahead. You may even find a few gems here and there. But don't go in there expecting great bargains or stuff that is going to blow your doors off....aint happening Mojumbo.
