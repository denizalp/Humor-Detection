I was going to delete this negative review, but instead have opted to update.  \n\nFinally, after a couple of weeks of frustration, the dealership came through and did what they promised.  I wouldn't have been nearly as upset with the delays and push-offs if someone, anyone, from the dealership would have followed through or kept me informed on why there were delays or even simply returned a call as promised. \n\nIn the end we got all of the things we were promised and I do really love the little car.  The GM called personally and let me know they were going to fix the issues I was having, so there is that.  I wasn't prepared to buy a car when I stopped by the first time, so some of the fault was mine because I didn't have my car title available.  However, I still feel an update call or return call would not have been too much to ask.
