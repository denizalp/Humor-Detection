Yet another time where I shouls have paid attention to the rating and reviews. \n\nThe customer service people are rude, on the phone & in person. \n\nOur room had HALF a roll of toilet paper. No extras hidden anywhere.  The trash wasn't thrown out from the previous tenants. Our bedding had stains on white sheets. The room phone wasn't connected & once I did connect it I noticed there were 0 buttons to dial the front desk or anyone from the hotel. \n\nI called the front desk for pool towels and the lady told me I had to come get them myself because she had a line of people in front of her. When I got there, she was checking a couple in and had 2 other people waiting. 1 lady simply need help with Wi-Fi the guy needed a new room key. \n\nThe grounds are decent, room size better than expected. Service horrible. If ur looking for somewhere to sleep and don't care about service then 5 stars here .. Other than that, pay a bit more and be happy somewhere else. Like the Clarendon in Phoenix that place was AMAZING.
