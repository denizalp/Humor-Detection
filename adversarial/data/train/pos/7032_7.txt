This is by far the worst experience I had at a club in Vegas. We booked a $5,000 minimum table and the Hostess and the bus boy were just plain rude. Not only that the type of people who go there are ghetto and obnoxious.  \n\nPresale tickets are definitely cheaper at this club and there's a reason for that. It is because they are not selective in the crowd they bring in and this place is not classy at all. The girls and the crowd at this club were all ugly as hell.\n\nWe went to XS the next day and met some Vegas locals that just came from Hakkasan. They told us \"the crowd was so ghetto that we had to leave and come here.\" Now I only booked a cabana at XS but the service and the people were 10000000x better than hakkasan was. \n\nTo be honest I only went to Hakkasan because I never been but if your thinking the same thing. Trust me its not worth it. Your gonna be in there packed like sardines with ugly smelly people. If you wanna fish can it then this might be the place for you but its definitely not for me.\n\nI also forgot to mention why I decided to actually create a yelp account to write this review.. Not only did I book that $5,000 dollar minimum table our group also got kicked out from it as well. \n\nSome passerby-er in the club decided to walk by and throw up in front of our table. The bus boy blamed it on our group and kicked us all out. When I asked him which one of us did you see do it he said that he didn't know but it had to be ours because it was in front of our table. No one in my group was even drunk yet and I would know if it was someone from our that threw up. It definitely was not us and the bus boy didn't even know who it was. He merely made a judgement call based on what he saw in front of the table. I gave a $500 hand shake tip in the beginning too...
