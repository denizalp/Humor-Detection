This weekend we were in Vegas and the hubs wanted a steak.  There are a LOT of steak options in Vegas, but we came here because we were in The Forum Shops.  \nOur food was pretty standard for The Palm.  The hubs steak was BIG.  \nThe server was a bit off.  I think this happens to us because we don't drink alcohol.  So it's basically, \"Here's your food.\"  That's cool.  I get it.
