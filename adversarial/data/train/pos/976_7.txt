The V Theater is definitely one of the smaller venues in town.  The service including the box office as well as the ushers aren't friendly.  It was a shame to receive poor treatment here.  \n\nThe theater itself is clean.  Seats are comfy.  If you are sitting on the side sections, your view may be blocked by the posts.  I'd suggest sitting in the center or along the outside wall to avoid any obstructions to the show.\n\nWhile I usually enjoy the more cozy venues, it was just ok.  I think they need to do some updating here.
