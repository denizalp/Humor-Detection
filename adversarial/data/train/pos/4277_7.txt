For the price of visiting the Louvre, you can spend 15-20 minutes walking a short loop around a bunch of broken down signs.  If you go during the day, you can do this in 100+ degree weather since it's an outside museum.\n\nFor the price, I would expect just a little more effort put in to the museum.  Fix up more of the signs.  Throw in some mister fans along the route, maybe some shade overhead in a few spots, and some water to drink.  Get some signage made explaining each major sign in detail instead of the little booklet.  Uncover the Caesar's Palace sign too...for the majority of the people that visit, it will be the main one they recognize.\n\nIt just doesn't seem worth it for the price.  We were in and out within 20 minutes.  That's a dollar\/minute.  After this stop we priced out each item on the rest of our trip as being a \"neon ticket\".  I also vowed to confront the person who recommended this place at my wife's next company party.
