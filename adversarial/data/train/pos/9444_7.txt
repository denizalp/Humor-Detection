I love filipino food, and love to try different restaurants. However this place probably has the poorest service. The interior is fancier than most filipino resturants, the food was good... But the service whomp whoomp whooomp. We asked for soup when we ordered our food.. We got our food and no soup. A couple minutes later the lady came and apologize for not giving us soup... More than half way through our meal still NO soup. We tried to look for someone and they just seemed busy talking.. Ended our meal upset because the lady even asked about our soup and still didn't even give it to us even when it wasn't busy yet they were sitting there chit chatting. Not cool. Won't be coming back.
