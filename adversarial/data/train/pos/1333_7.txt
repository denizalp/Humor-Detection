Nice ambience good looking staff that don't have a clue. Especially our server. Food came out at different times and the server made some cock and ball story \"that is the style\" bullshit, just wanted to have a nice dinner with friends and they had eaten and finished their dinner and my basic pasta ravioli still didn't hit the table. Seriously how long does it take to bang out 4 pieces of ravioli? I have to say the manager was really nice and hot as hell but the waitress was a dumb broad. Oh and then wait.... It finally arrives and as I'm eating, a second dish magically appears! Come on people get it together !
