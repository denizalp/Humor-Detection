Fantastic yes-you-guessed-it Corner Bar located here in quaint Ayrsley! If you are tired of the Piedmont Social House scene like I am, definitely stop on over here for a unique experience. Honestly, I don't see how anyone can go wrong. Great drinks, great food. Dude.. Just make your way over here and stop playing corn hole or whatever that is called. \n\nI actually really enjoy that they don't have a drink menu. It forces conversation with the extremely knowledgeable bartenders for one and two.. You may end up trying something you never knew you loved. (Perk for me, they now have Riesling here) \n\nDespite not having a drink menu, they do have a small food menu. So far I have only had the Lettuce Wraps (which were actually really good) so I can't speak too extensively on the food but a fellow neighboring bar mate eased any apprehensions by letting me know that majority of the items are pretty good. After browsing some of the reviews, I think many would agree. Never had lettuce wraps that were beef but it was a really good! \n\nSide note: you know that this place is golden when they have a \"regular\" who visits often and doesn't even live locally! Come sit at the bar and I am sure one other person sitting there too is a regular. \n\nPro Tip: Make sure you get Zane as your bartender.
