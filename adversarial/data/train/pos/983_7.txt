Fairly standard for a congee place. Reiterating others' comments, super busy. Ordered takeout here on Saturday night. Shredded pork chow mein and beef tendon & brisket soup noodle. Asked for chow mein noodles to be super crispy. They weren't. The container of sauce for the chow mein is larger than I'm used to, so I suppose it's a good thing. I'd rather more noodles than more sauce though. The beef tendon and brisket soup noodle was fairly standard. My mom said the color on the tendon (more on the red\/orange side, looked very artificial.\n\nPlus: I called in my order ahead on the phone and the woman who answered the phone spoke in really good English. I was super confused. I thought I called the wrong place.
