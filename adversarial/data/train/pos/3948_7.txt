I wanted to add three more stars, but oh, well...I'll put them here ***  \n\nI went for my second visit 03\/29\/2013...I felt like Jello afterwards : ) and did not and want to get out of the recliner.  I slept like a brick again, another good night's sleep obtained.\n\nThe price is SWEEEET! and it's so easy to set up appointment via smartphone, it has a very quiet, relaxing environment, the low lighting inside is outstanding, especially when the treatment is done;  easy access to clinic, kind and compassionate staff and Mayo is such a sweetie, very gentle and LOVES her job, I can tell. : )\n \nWalk-in appointments are available, YAY!\n\nDid I tell you about the Indian restaurant next door? it's pretty good (at least to me), but you will not regret your visit overall.
