Two weekends waiting for furniture.Strongly recommend NOT paying the $59 for delivery.  They deliver the wrong items. \nI'm on my second Saturday waiting for them to show. Yawn. The three hour delivery window was explained to me that a 1 hour extension either side could happen. Running the math again I keep coming up with 5 hours. Perhaps RC Willey is modeling its customer service on businesses such as cox cable or the DMV.\nHonestly for the hassle of dealing with a simple purchase with no apologies or offer of a reimbursement for delivery costs I advise stay away. \nI thought I was shopping at a real furniture store. My mistake. Update. Furniture did not arrive.  Called the customer service line and cancelled the order. UGH what a nightmare experience.
