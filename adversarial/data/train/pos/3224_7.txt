At $12 for non-members, not too bad to be able to spend 2 hours walking and examining some excellent artworks. We opted not to upgrade to the temporary exhibits and stuck with the permanent ones, which was still really great!\n\nGreat layout in a wide circle and other than a couple of side rooms, very easy to navigate and still be able to see everything. The exhibits are well spaced and not crowded at all, so there's no feeling of being overwhelmed by the art.\n\nSculptures, furniture, portraits, jewelry, glassworks, paintings and very large exhibits, all intermixed and organized by type. Lovely!\n\nTip: A little confusing that the exhibits are only on the 3rd and 4th floors. Weird.\n\nOh, and it's called the Mint Museum not because of chewing gum but the building was originally the Charlotte Mint. As in printing money.
