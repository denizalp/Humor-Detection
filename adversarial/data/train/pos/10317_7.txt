After the services in the church and at the graveside for the interment of my mother's ashes (she's next to Dad now, and having a grand old time with him in heaven together with my sister and brother...), we held a luncheon to thank guests and relatives.  This was prearranged by someone at church who knew this restaurant well, and they did not disappoint.  We were very late after the graveside service, but they were patient and accommodating: we had one too many table reserved, and they had no issue reducing the table count where another less friendly manager would have insisted on the minimum guaranteed.  The wait staff is quite diffident, referring everything to the manager. Other than that, service was good, and the food was wonderful.  The crispy pork belly that started us off really hit the spot - man I wish we had some fine whiskey or a fine red with that.  Mushroom dish was impressive among other great fare.  We had enough to take away with us.  We'll have to come back for dim sum next time we're in Toronto.
