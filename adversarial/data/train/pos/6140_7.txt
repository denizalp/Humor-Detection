Now THIS is a place to buy meat in Kensington Market!  True old world quality and flavour AND modernist ethical sourcing sensibilities make this one of the absolute best meateries in the GTA.  \n\nAnything pork here is automatic nominee for best in the city - chops are as good as they get and the sausages are beautifully balanced spice wise with amazing texture and snap (yes, the good ones snap...)  The poultry is really great as well although nobody touches Gasparro's when it comes to bird.   The beef was a bit more of a mixed bag for me.  The more flavourful cheaper cuts are exceptional when cooked slowly and carefully, yet the high end steaks were just not that exceptional.  Good yes, but not quite worth the price for me.  Haven't had any lamb yet but I am looking forward to giving it a try.\n\nNow let's talk about the name;\n\n\"Meat Locker?\"  What marketing genius decided to call one of the most aesthetically pleasing arrangements of carved carcasses \"Meat Locker\"? Why, if they called it La Galerie des Beaux-Viande they could raise the prices by 50 percent - uh- Yeah......Meat Locker...kind of grows on you...hey...I like that...Meat Locker.  \n\nGreat name!\n\nSanagan's is definitely worth a visit.
