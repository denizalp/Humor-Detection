Well, I was walking through the parking lot, when I noticed two of the chefs out front having a cigarette break. One was staring at me and hollering at me to get my attention, when he got my attention, the other chef farted as loud as humanly possible. I can't comment on the food because that was enough to make me never want to eat here. I went next door instead. And no chefs farted at me.
