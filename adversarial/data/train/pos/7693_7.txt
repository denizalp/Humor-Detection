I'm on a roll to try all the Thai restaurants in Madison!\n\nWe came here on a Friday night and was greeted by our friendly host\/server. We started off with an order of the spring rolls ($4.95 for two), the green curry with tofu ($11.95), and chicken pad thai ($10.95).\n\nThe spring rolls arrived with warm peanut sauce, which was a nice change to the cold dip in other restaurants.  The green curry was not a hit, the consistency and color was not appetizing and I found it a bit bland and lackluster. The pad thai was a entirely different story, one of the closer versions to the much loved, authentic, Vietnamese street food. The rice noodles were evenly covered in the sweet and sour sauce and peanuts. It was rich and a delight to slurp the silky noodles. \n\nWe really enjoyed our server and the pad thai, I'd make this a regular just for the pad thai!\n\nThe free parking lot is a plus, especially being on Willy street.
