I get it now. I used to hate Indian food, but oh man, not anymore. Mirch Masala, I love you. Please don't ever leave me.\n\nI don't think I could ever properly write a review for this food. I'm unfamiliar with the spices and methods used in Indian cooking. All I know is this is some of the best food I've ever had in my life. I'm sorry Paul's Pelmini, but this is my new comfort food. \n\nI order here quite often and I always get buttered chicken, samosas, keema naan, garlic naan, and aloo paratha. I've had a few other things here and there, but those are my happy place. Split between my boyfriend and I. I don't eat the rice. I just dip naan in curry. It's really too much food, if we're being honest. I just don't know what to cut. It's all too good.\n\nThe butter chicken is delicious, creamy, liquid gold. The naan is almost always perfect. Sometimes the garlic naan can get a little hard and sometimes the keema naan can get a little tough. Neither are a regular issue. Usually they're fluffy, flavorful slices of heaven. The samosas are always perfect. They're fist sized balls of fried spice. Definitely try them if you haven't.\n\nI've only ever gotten delivery from EatStreet so I can't say much as far as the restaurant itself goes. If you're trying to pick which Indian restaurant to order from, I've had them all and this is the right choice. You're not going to regret it.
