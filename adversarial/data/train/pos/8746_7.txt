Came here for a nighttime meal\/drink! We were near the area of the Distillery and wanted to have dinner here! \n\nThe portions for food were rather expensive, shared plates were ~$13-$15, and were the same size as their burger meals which were about $2 more. I think it was expensive for the size of the portion, but in terms of the price in Distillery District, this was not an expensive meal at all.\n\nI tried the Cassis 9oz and my partner tried the Vanilla 12oz Beer (both $7.50). I loved the Cassis beer cause it had a sweet fruity taste to it. The foam of the vanilla was quite strong and it was a little darker compared to the purpley, pinkish outlook from the Cassis. Either way, both beers were quite delicious,a definite recommend for their beers.\n\nWe tried their Spinach Dip ($14) which included a bowl of creamy spinach dip, a few slices of warm flatbread and multi-coloured tortilla chips. I somewhat enjoyed this dish, I thought the flatbread was heated to the right temperature, and I thought the tortilla chips were a splendid add-on to the meal.\n\nWe also got the Ontario Angus Burger ($16). This burger was quite petite, the size of a McDonalds Happy Meal Burger with a thicker bun, patty and more lettuce. I thought this bun was rather dry, I wish more sauce was added to the burger. In addition, I wished it was a little hotter, I didn't think the bun was heated to a hot enough temperature.\n\nOther than that, I would really recommend coming for the beer, not so much the food (except maybe the shareables). They also have a cup of LifeSaver mints you can grab after your meal!
