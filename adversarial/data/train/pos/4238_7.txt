The food is very good. I had the salmon tartare and the mussels, which were both excellent. \n\nMy only issue with the place is that on the wine glasses there is a very subtle white line to make sure servers don't overpour you. I found that to be completely ridiculous!  That's something I would expect from a chain restaurant like Applebee's.  Obviously there is an overly anal manager in charge. Sorry just thought that was pretty tacky!
