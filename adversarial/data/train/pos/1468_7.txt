It's like a little hometown convenience store. Or.... a great prop to a zombie movie. You can come in here, get supplies, smokes, food, bandages.... and still survive the apocolypse for one more day!\n\nZombies aside, it's a wonderful little shop that's open pretty late especially on weekends when you need gum, an advil, or whatever. Right across the street from JoBot, and on weekends there is normally a totally rad guy playing guitar on the porch. Love it.
