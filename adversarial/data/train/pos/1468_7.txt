I did not stop laughing once during the show.  There we 3 comedians before the headliner and they were all hilarious.  The headlining comedian was so funny.  I wish I could repeat some of the jokes but they would surely violate some yelp policies on profanity haha.  \n\nWe were seated in the main room before other guests because we agreed to order some dinner.  We just got some loaded fries and nachos.  Typical bar food and they were good.  Had a full bar but we didn't utilize it more than a couple rounds of draft beers.\n\nThe waitress was prompt and not pushy which I liked very much.\n\nThe host was friendly and made a few jokes himself.  Never felt uncomfortable or out of place like I do at other Scottsdale venues time to time.\n\nCan't wait to go back and would recommend this venue to others.
