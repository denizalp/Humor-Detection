The view of the city from this restaurant was gorgeous! I loved it, it was very romantic... \n\nThe food was okay, a little over priced but the view made it worth it. The lobster mashed potatoes were delish!\n\nOur server on the other hand was why I didn't rate this place with five stars. Ion or whatever his name was the worst server. But otherwise it was such a beautiful experience.
