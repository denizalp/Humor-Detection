Olivier welcomes you with charm, with passion for food, and a rich love for people in this business oriented block on I-215 on Sunset. \n\nI've been coming to Baguette Cafe for couple of years now...Yelp gave me an opportunity to embrace this simple yet respected establishment.  \n\nThey serve breakfast and lunch with indoor and outdoor tables available...the outdoor seating can be almost as welcoming as the food, especially during a beautiful November day when the Vegas weather invites you to sit outside and catch some sun with your food. I usually get any of their grilled sandwiches with a cup of soup. Most of dishes come with small side portion of green salad. My love swears that their Vegetable Quiche is the best in town and I believe that is true...it often sells out so if you want it, you can call ahead or come early.\n\nWe shared Chocolate Tart this morning and it was so good... their pasties made in house so you know it's fresh and French.
