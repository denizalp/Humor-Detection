Banana bread french toast. That's all you need to know because its delicious.\nEggs, yeah, ok. Bacon...definitely could improve with thicker applewood slices. But this banana bread french toast, with apple compote and some whipped cream was a moist, flavorful, delicious item to try. Try it. Enjoy it. \n\nSpecial shoutout to my waitress Tely....who was fantastic. Great service, always checking up on me. Brought over the whipped cream (not part of the menu) and said add this. 5\/5 for Tely's service.\n\nPlace was pretty busy for Noon on a Saturday, so again I found counter space for a quick sit down. I needed food to replenish my body after a 4 mile hike. They have a full menu with everything from eggs, crepes, benedicts, sandwiches, etc.\n\n Located on the corner of Sunset and Eastern across from Sunset Park.
