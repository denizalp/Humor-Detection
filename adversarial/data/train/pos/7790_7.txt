Carl's Junior is one of those good fast food places you don't find east of the Mississippi.\n\nOne of the surprises with moving to the Valley, was discovering Carl's, Jr.  As with most fast food places, I rarely give higher than three star, because... well...  they're fast food, not Three Star Michelin cuisine.   \n\nBut Carl's Jr might be the exception to my rule.  I would offer they are at least  three and half stars on most occasions we've dinned here.  We would recommend any of the burgers, but also the Chicken Strips.  They are flavorful and as good as any we've had, including the Colonel's and Popeye's.  \n\nWe would also recommend the Malts and Shakes.  They use real milk and make it fresh before your eyes.  Nice!  Also, be on the lookout for coupons in your Sunday paper.  Most times there's buy one, get one free.\n\nEnjoy!
