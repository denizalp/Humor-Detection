We went to Mint this past saturday for my friends Bachelorette party. I had contacted them to have 23 of us girls put on the list. I was warned that depending on the time of night there may be a wait. I was ok with that. Until we were there. The bouncer was very very rude and wouldnt even acknowledge me. Once he did he told me to stop yelling at him. He was a complete jerk. We waited in the VIP line. He wouldnt let any of us in, but some dude walked up next to us, cut the line gave bouncer money and he got to go in. I just think seriously, we were there for a bachelorette with a bunch of hot chicks, and your going to let a dude in first just cause he slipped you a 20. I would of given the bouncer money too if he wasnt such a jerk. \n\nThe Unisex bathroom is discusting. I saw mulitple couples going into the same stall. I was scared to use the restroom knowing that its more like a sexroom. discusting. \n\nOverall, I would never go back.
