The food, as always, was terrific. The service, however, was seriously lacking.  \n\nWe have never been for dinner, just breakfast and lunch.  We thought we would give it a try and we were excited to see it was not very full of patrons (if you go to Chompie's for breakfast, you know the controlled chaos that surrounds the dining room).  \n\nIt took forever to get our drinks ordered, and when we go our drinks our server dropped them and left before we could order our appetizer.  When we finally were able to order our server kept cutting us off.  \n\nOur food came over a half hour after we ordered it, and well after 2 other tables that came in after us were served. I am convinced our server forgot to put in our order.\n\nThen on the way out we stopped at the bakery.  It took close to 10 minutes to get someone to help us.  The night hostess had to go to the back and make someone come out and help us and another customer.\n\nWe will definitely go back for dinner, but I'm making sure we won't be in that servers section again.
