Pleasantly surprised!\n\nLet's be honest.  The name and the exterior appearance of Taj Mahal exude a cheesy vibe, no?  Shame on me for judging a book by its cover.  Under this roof is some tasty Indian food, but--here comes the disclaimer--I should note that my experience with Indian cuisine is limited.  If this is \"authentic,\" then I'm a fan of Indian food.  If this isn't the real deal, then I'm not sure I'm terribly interested in trying \"real\" Indian food at all!\n\nThe menu--extensive.\nThe food--flavorful and high-quality.\nThe portions--generous.\nThe price--reasonable.\nThe service--friendly...and slow.  Read on.\n\nAnd the naan.  Ohhhh, the naan!  To die for.\n\nHusband and I make it a point not to dine out if we're in a rush or a potential time crunch; I think it's rude to demand fast service at a non-fast-food restaurant.  Still, Taj Mahal gives a whole new meaning to the idea of a leisurely dining experience.  We actually chose to pay in cash and left a sizable tip so that we didn't have to wait for change or a credit card transaction.  Over 20 minutes must have passed from the time we confirmed we were ready for the check and when that check actually came, which prompted me to whisper to my guy, \"Babe, we can't ever come here if we're in a hurry...unless we're in a hurry for curry.\"  I know, I know.  Couldn't resist.\n\nCan't wait to come back to try the lunch buffet, which is 10AM-3PM daily.
