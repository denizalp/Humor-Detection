Waiting till that last minute I have put off the DMV for months now, but it is almost the end of May and driving the motorcycle with expired tags would not be a smart idea. One of my twins lost his ID and with him wanting to start working next month then we are sharing our appointment here at the DMV. The DMV in Las Vegas has a feature called DASH where an individual can make their appointment online and be seen prior to everyone else with that said appointment time. Now these appointments are made on the internet with your phone number and need to be made sometimes a week in advance. So it makes visiting the DMV easier.\n\nThe DMV experience can be a little overwhelming here they do not give an individual a number to listen for it is the last four of your phone number. When you come in for an appointment or not your phone number is placed into a que that they call the last four and the window number when it is your turn. You can check the status of your point or turn in line by text S on your phone. So this makes the DMV experience more interesting to me. \n\nMost of the time here is spent playing the waiting game waiting for the last four digits to be called. The agent at the counter was very nice in helping renew the registration and my sons ID. So come witn patience, an appointment if you can, and an appetite since the small cafe will feed us. But its not free so bring money!
