Once you've eaten here, you really don't want to go to any other buffets. No, I'm not exaggerating either. I'm being completely honest & serious. This place is A-M-A-Z-I-N-G! I came here 2 months ago and WOW, all of the food was delicious & not to mention the desserts.. YUMMY! I seriously cannot wait to go back to Vegas to eat here again! HAHA.
