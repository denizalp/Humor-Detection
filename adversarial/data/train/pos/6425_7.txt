Huge fan of Aria Hotel!  My significant other and I stayed here last summer and absolutely loved it.  This was my first time in Vegas and I'm so glad we didn't decide to stay at a cheaper, cliche, themed hotel.  \n\nThis hotel was very luxurious and I almost didn't want to come home to my piddly loft downtown.  What do you mean my apt doesn't have remote controlled drapes, lighting, television, music and climate?  PFT, screw that! \n\nThe security was a nice feature.  They [room]card you before entering the elevator lobby so non-guests aren't able to just waltz in.  \n\nI must admit, I'm not sure about Vegas.  I think I could not go back and not feel like I'm missing anything since I'm not big on gambling and clubbing hasn't been my thing for about 10 years.  Come to think of it, I'm only 28 so it's definitely never been my thing!  BUT I would come back here in a heart beat JUST for the pool.  That triple digit heat, the pool-side alcohol service, the hot bodies, people watching.  Def. saw a lot of young women with some wrinkly old men - they totally married for love!  If I ever go back to Vegas the pool is where you'll find me.\n\nThe whole experience was very relaxing and glam.  And the location, center-strip, can't be beat.  A lot of the good shopping and sights are an easy walk.  However, there really is no reason to leave the hotel.  Everything you need is right there.  Food, gambling, pools, clubs, ZARKANA etc.  However, it was rather convenient to have CVS (walgreens? can't remember) just a short walk across the strip...regular priced sunscreen is better than the crazy marked up stuff in the hotel.  \n\nPS the casino is smoke free!
