Well now I know not to ever order a spinach pizza from here ever again ... Next time I'll go to the grocery story & buy a frozen pizza & a bag of spinach & just throw the spinach on top .... Or stick with dominos where they actually cook the spinach in \/ with the pizza. On top of that .. The pizza is dry !!! I'm upset because I was really craving this.
