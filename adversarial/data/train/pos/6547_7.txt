Although this park is large and located close to my place, I rarely come here. Perhaps because I don't have a kid, a dog, or a pair of skinny jeans and a fedora. The gentrification of this park makes people-watching a complete waste of time. The most exciting thing I've heard or seen is hipster moms deciding which restaurant they should go to for lunch with their 2 kids and dog.\n\nHere's a novel idea: How about you actually cook some of your own vegan food from all the fair trade organic shit you buy from the farmer's market? Oh right... you don't 'cook' you 'prepare' because you eat 'raw'.\n\nThis is everything I hate about the world today.\n\nThere are just too many people here, period. This is why most of the grass is trampled, leaving lfew spaces of soft grass for picnicking. Since I LOVE to eat and drink in the park, I do both--despite the fine for drinking in public. I figure if I get dinged it's less than $100 and I save at least that much by dining and drinking al fresco vs. most nearby restaurants. So the many cops on bicycles don't really scare me, but they ARE annoying.\n\nFYI, despite it's gentrification, TB remains one of the parks most frequented by bicycle cops handing out fines for drinking in public. Make sure to cover up-- and I don't mean sunscreen or shade-- I'm talking about your wine bottle and glass.\n\nOr your can of PBR, since the people in this park seem to like that beer. \n\nThey also seem to like non-prescription horn rimmed glasses, whining about not having a boss?? (yes, i feel sorry for you.) and complaining how nearby restaurants won't allow their dogs in for lunch.\n\nSee ya!
