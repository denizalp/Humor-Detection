There's not a lot of places to find open on a Sunday when you are under time constraints but since we wanted to get something fast my husband and I stopped here for lunch.\n\nBasically it is a grab and go sandwich shop but they do have a few tables for in house dining. The cold cuts are provided by Boar's head. They also serve breakfast sandwiches till about 1. They sell soup and they have a few groceries in the back for purchase. In addition they have specialty sandwiches of the day or you can build your own.\n\nMy husband had an Italian sandwich with coleslaw while I settled for an oven roasted turkey on pumpernickle with lettuce and tomato. Drinks are available for purchase in a cooler near the restroom.\n\nThey do have styrofoam containers to help you gauge the size of the portion you wish to purchase. We got our food after paying at the register and sat down. It was typical better end grocery food. Between the sandwich and the coleslaw that was enough for a quick bite.\n\nThe deli is located across the train tracks directly opposite the Oakmont Bakery. There is a walkway if you are parking on that two way street which will safely get you across the train tracks.
