Being from Miami and being Cuban American, I am definitely somewhat of an authority on cuban food. With that said, this fell short of the real thing... WAA WAA.... \nI ordered a ton of food, to go for myself and some friends of mine. I have been raving about Cuban food and was excited to share my culture and was let down. The main dishes (the meat) was actually decent - we shared fried steak or Vaca Frita (right on with the flavor) and breaded chicken-Pollo empanisado. However ALL the side dishes tasted frozen or packaged. The congri or arroz moros were NOT home made and the platanos were definitely from frozen banaas. The tostones (salty, fried plantains) tasted chalky (frozen) and the mojo (sauce for the fried plantains) wasn't even close to authentic mojo. Mojo is literally the easiest thing to make, why not make it fresh! Maybe I am overly critical because I have grown up with Cuban food and have had TRULY authentic versions (out of my grandmothers kitchen) but, this was so SAD... \n\nOh well, Miami is only a plane ride away.\n\nBy the way- It shouldn't take an hour to put food together, for a to-go order when you phoned in the order, thirty minutes prior.
