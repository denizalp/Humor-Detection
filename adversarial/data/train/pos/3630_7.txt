I've been here before it was renovated. Was kinda cheap looking and run down  sketchy, but went to dim sum on Saturday and wowza!! Renovated. Its clean and fancy!! \n\nThe decor is not the only think that changed. The food is significantly better than it used to be. I think it's now comparable to other dim sum places in the area *cough*DragonBoatFusion*cough*\n\nWe got all the typical dim sum fare, buns, rice, rolls tentacles,tripe,congee. Pork buns were super. Also the rice rolls were extra yum!\n\nI'll be coming back. I'm glad I have a new place to go!!
