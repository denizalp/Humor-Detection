5 em effin stars. That's right! I remember when my fella and I first started dating he would always suggest the drive in when it was his turn to pick a date spot, but we never ended up going. Fast forward over three years later, we finally made it out to the drive-in. \n\nWe were looking for something different to do on a Saturday night and this seemed like an interesting option. I wasn't expecting much, but we had an excellent time. We brought snacks and drinks and found our way to the movie we wanted. I was blown away by how cheap and fun this place is. It was different than the drive-ins I had been to as a kid. They have multiple screens showing first run movies, which is awesome. We ended up staying for the double feature, which is well worth it for the price. Some people go all out with speakers, lounge chairs, blankets and pillows. I might plan for that next time, but we were nice and snuggly in my medium size SUV, which gave us plenty of room to be comfortable.\n\nI honestly can't wait to come back again soon and bring a pillow or two just to make the evening that much more comfortable.
