This is the worse run \"university\" in the country. The people hired to work there are incompetent. The university does not understand it's own procedures, nor follows them. It is in a drug infested neighborhood, in a horrible part of town. I would not send my dog to this place.\n\nIf you understand the value of a good university, a good college experience and how a decent university operates, do not send your kid here.
