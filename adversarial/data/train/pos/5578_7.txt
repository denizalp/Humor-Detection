I am breathless and just a dash bloated,  lol ..after having Choco mallow intercourse and better than sex cupcakes .\nYeah, I actually ordered 1 dozen of these cupcakes which contained both these flavors, and had the audacity to eat 2 of them ..one right after the other .\n\nChocolate mallow intercourse is a great name for this S'moretastic martini  it was almost overkill on flavor so i had to  chase it down with the Raspberry and Champagne aka better than sex cupcake.\n\nIt wasn't better than sex ( not much in this world is ) but it was good and although I LOVE chocolate I actually preferred this cupcake over the Choco mallow one -which dare i say, was a little too boozy for my taste .\n\nI love the concept of these boozy treats and they were pretty good ..just not mind blowing .They looked cute ..but again, not mind blowing in their overall prettiness .I still give this company a 4 star rating as their customer service was very good, plus these cupcakes make a great gift or party idea, IMO .\n\n10 lucky random people will be getting  free cupcake's ..yeah ,i am going to share the sin .
