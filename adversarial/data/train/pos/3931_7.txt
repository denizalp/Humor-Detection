I've never set foot in a Whiskey Row before, and that was a mistake on my part. I've always avoided it like the plague because it just seemed like the typical \"grab a beer and watch sports\" type of place, but last night for dinner I decided to give them a chance. My SO and I were treated very well by the staff and the service was prompt about the food. The food itself was surprisingly good, the southern fries are fantastic and they give you a lot that you can share with others. The music is loud and country, which I don't mind but what's really great is the atmosphere and roominess of the booths! I had a great time here and would definitely come again!
