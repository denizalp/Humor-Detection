Chelsea ballroom for Super Bowl Party !\n\nNever again!!!!\n\nHow is it that everyone that got tickets to attend the Super Bowl Party at the Chelsea ballroom and about 100 people left standing.  There were not enough tables and chairs for the guests. It was ridiculous!!  It was so unorganized!!  \n\nI had to put two chairs together side by side and three of us sit together, of course the other end girl and myself get to share it with only half of our cheeks.  My husband had to stand during the 1st half of the game.  The other guy went back up to the room and watch the game, my bro in law went out to game at a table, one girl went up to the room and took a nap.  Thats how 7 of us got seating at the end.  And we snatched from other tables too.  Pathetic.!!\n\nThe food selection was very minimal!!  One small circle and that's it.  No pizza, shrimp cocktails, Haagen dazs ice cream, buffalo wings ran out, No vegetarian food for veggie friend. I could go on... but I'm tired.   I guess we were spoiled by Caesers Palace Super Bowl.  \n\nGood Game though.  I'm a Denver fan so I didn't really care who wins.  Although we cheered on Baltimore because half of our friends put their bet on Ravens 1st half and 49ers 2nd half.
