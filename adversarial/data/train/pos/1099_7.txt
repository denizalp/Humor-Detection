I came in to Pinches Tacos mainly for a taste of the Mexican style streen corn. But I didn't feel right ordering just corn so I got a taco al pastor too. \n\nLong story short, the prices are high and service takes too long.\n\nShort story long, yes, the food here is kind of pricey. $3+ for a small taco. Almost $3 for an ear of corn. And yes, it took a long time to get just a taco and ear of corn. The staff seem to prepare multiple orders before carrying them out to the customers who, in most cases, eat outside. It was getting gusty outside while I waited so I moved inside.\n\nMy food came out very shortly after I moved myself inside the restaurant. The al pastor taco came with a goodly amount of pork, a fair bit of onion and cilantro and a healthy laddle of salsa. It was dripping grease and juice. It was a good representation of one of my favorite types of tacos but it was not my favorite version. The house made tortilla was a nice touch though. \n\nThe corn was good as Mexican style street corn tends to be. The crisp kernels of sweet corn took nicely to the crema, cheese and chili. I enjoyed it thoroughly though, again, it was not my favorite version of the dish. \n\nFor me, the food is fresh and service is friendly. I appreciate both. But the price you pay and the time you wait is disproportionate to what you receive. Another case of a place to check out if you are in the area but not to make a destination of.
