Honolulu Cookie Company - The LINQ Promenade\n\nI never miss a visit to the Honolulu Cookie Company whenever I am at the LINQ Promenade.  There's just something about HCC that I can't deny and the samples that keep me coming back.  The staff at all Honolulu Cookie Company's that I've been to excel at customer service. I may not always purchase something, but I always get samples.  My favorites include the Chocolate Chip Macadamia, Dark Chocolate Kona Coffee, Kona Coffee, and the White Chocolate Kona Coffee.  Honolulu Cookie Company make great gifts for friends, family, and me.  The Las Vegas locations have cool Vegas themed box sets too.  \n\nTIP #1:  Located a couple of steps from Sprinkles.\nTIP #2:  Pumpkin flavor is only available for a limited time.
