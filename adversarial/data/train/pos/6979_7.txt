I am a fan of the uptown Basil location and was excited to see this location open up closer to home. Overall the meal was a huge disappointment and I don't plan on returning. \n\nWe ordered pad thai, tom yum soup, sweet and sour tofu, basil rolls, egg rolls and lettuce chicken wraps. The chicken in the lettuce wraps had actually gone bad - the smell was noticeably off and we had to send it back. Basil rolls were good but small for the price - just two pieces with hardly any shrimp. Same with the egg roll - we couldn't even taste egg. The sweet and sour tofu was the nights major miss - it had absolutely zero flavor. The sweet and sour sauce added nothing to the dish and we had to heap on our own spices from the spice tray. Pad thai also had almost no flavor as well. \n\nService was brusque and spotty. The prices do not match the food and service and ambiance was considerably less warm than the uptown location. Will get my thai fix at thai first instead.
