With a beautiful new remodel it's totally necessary for an updated review! It's no surprise I love this museum. I love Andy Warhol, I love his work and I love that he's from Pittsburgh!\n\nThey've remodeled the museum so that you start at the top with Andy's earlier years and work down through his life and career. I don't know if somehow I missed it before, but I'd never seen many of the pictures and facts of his very early life and family growing up in Pittsburgh. It was so cool to see him as a child and learn about his whole family. I truly loved reading about how much his parents supported his artist talents.\n\nI also loved seeing more of his earlier works, when he was doing retail ads. I know I remember seeing some of this before at the museum, but maybe it wasn't as clearly marked and displayed as it is now.\n\nOf course there's still the classics, like the silver cloud room and the screen printed works that are a must see. I LOVE the new lobby with the silver colors and replica of the couch from his Factory days. Great photo opp!\n\nI like that the cafe is upstairs now, although it seems that they've cut down on options? But the gift shop is amazing! So much larger, with even more quirky selections. I'd come here just for the gift shop to buy a gift (or a little something for myself!). \n\nIf you're visiting Pittsburgh this museum is a MUST. Although it is not for the faint of heart. Keep in mind there is some not so G rated materials aka I once checked out a very scandalous special exhibit here! But it really is a crown jewel in our fair city and should be visited by tourists and locals alike!
