\"It is better to look good, than to serve good. . . \" \n\nFirst of all, the burgers are very good. I ordered mine medium, and that's how it actually arrived. Not many places will actually cook a burger to order. Maybe they SAY they will, but no. The fries (both sweet potato and regular) were tasty. So no real complaints about the food.\n\nBut . . . COME ON Sam Fox. . . you can't just put model-looking women out there as servers and hostesses, have them take far too long to seat us because they couldn't figure out which tables were open, deny that a special was being offered (until I showed the email for it on my phone),  have them take 10 minutes or so to bring a glass of wine, delay a simple food order by about 20 minutes or so, repeatedly neglect water and drink refills, forget that the burger was ordered without a bun, and expect customers not to notice because they've been blinded by an abundance of voluptuary feminine goodness. I've gotten better service at actual stripjoints that served food. \n\nSo, not really a fan. Maybe caught them on a bad night (though the Tuesday night crowd didn't seem like it would have been too imposing). I might give them another chance, but then if I'm paying $11 for a burger ala carte, basically everything needs to be perfect to convince me to go back. Smashburger and 5 Guys are just down the street, and I'd rather not pay for the pretention of service.
