Actually I'm not their client. \nI tried 3 times in October 2014 to become to, but...\n1) I came to the salon two times - it was closed. Even light was switched off. It was strange, cuz I've been there at their workdays in the middle of the day. Also there was no notice on the door. \n2) I tried to make an appointment through their website - it doesn't work. May be it works, but not for newcomers - you name and phone should be in their database. Guys, hello! - it is too stupid.  \n\"You could call them\" you think? Nope. English is my second language and it is too difficult for me to understand people by phone - it is easier to speak face to face. Besides I live in 2 mins by walk.
