The search continues to find a good AYCE sushi restaurant in Vegas...and Island Sushi and Grill has been getting quite a lot of attention as of late.\n\nWe had to see what the fuss was all about as well, so we came on a Monday night to enjoy their $24.95\/pp AYCE sushi dinner.  (Lunch is $20.99\/pp.)  \n\nWhen you first walk through the doors, you'll find yourself at a walk up counter.  This is just the 'grill' part of the restaurant serving up lots of Hawaiian plate options.  If you make a right, you'll enter the 'sushi' part of Island Sushi and Grill and if you want AYCE, this is where you want to be.\n\nAfter being seated and our beverage orders were taken, the waitress came by to ask if we wanted to start with any appetizers.  She also gave us a sheet and pen to fill out for our nigiri and sushi roll options.  \n\nAppetizers: \n* Ahi Belly, Garlic Pepper Sauce (limit one order per person) - A small portion, but tasty!\n* Ahi Poki - Pretty good!\n* Deep Fried Geso - Our favorite was the deep fried baby octopus.  It comes in an order of three with a dipping sauce.  Pretty good stuff!\n* Edamame\n* Garlic Chicken\n* Hamachi Kama (limit one order per person)\n* Pork Gyoza\n* Raw Crab Poke (limit one order per person)\n* Tako Kim Chee Poke (limit one order per person)\n\nNigiri - They do give you small pieces of fish on small mounds of rice, which is a good thing. It's AYCE after all, so you can order more.  But it can be discouraging when you first see it.\n* Albacore\n* Amaebi (limit one order per person)\n* Garlic Tuna\n* Hamachi \n* Hirame\n* Ika\n* Ikura\n* Saba\n* Sake\n* Scallop Mayo\n* Tai\n* Uni (limit one order per person)\n\nThings we forgot to order because we were so full: Eggplant Fries, Fried Tofu Poke, Lomi Salmon, Mochiko Chicken, and Salmon Kama.\n\nEveryone seems to rave about their rolls, but we're not big on rolls with just the two of us.  So, we didn't have any.  But if we were with a larger party, there were definitely a few that we would consider.\n\nI wouldn't say their sushi is the highest quality, but I think people come because they do have a few other items like mochiko chicken, garlic chicken deep friend baby octopus, ahi poke, raw crab, tako kim chee poke, etc.  Like many AYCE sushi joints in Vegas, it's about what appetizers and cooked items are offered as well.\n\nThey are quite specific about any charges for leftover food - $1 for nigiri and $3 for an 8 piece roll.  So take you time when ordering, especially if you're ordering rolls.   \n\nYou are limited on one dessert option per person.  Everyone talks about the 808 Special, so we got one of those.  It's a deep-fried banana, ice cream, fresh strawberries, whipped cream, and chocolate sauce.  But our favorite was the Malasada Sundae.  One very delicious malasada cut into four pieces, ice cream, whipped cream, and guava(?) sauce.\n\nService was quite efficient and the waitresses were friendly.  We didn't have to wait long at all for any of our orders, which is definitely a plus.  Beverages were refilled without having to ask and any empty plates were cleared quickly as well, so no complaints about service at all.\n\nThey also offer a frequent eater card, ten AYCE and you get one free.\n\nWhat makes this place a real locals' place is all the specials they offer.  You can tell there are a lot of regulars here - families, couples, singles, etc.  Some are here for the grill menu to go or the sit down sushi.  \n\nHappy Hour: 50% off all sushi rolls + drinks specials\nMondays to Saturdays: 3:00 PM - 5:00 PM, 9:00 PM - Close\nSunday: 3:00 PM - 5:00 PM, 8:00 PM - Close\n\nLadies' Night: Drink Specials Only\nWednesdays: 3:00 PM - Close\n\nDrink Specials: \n$3.00 Large Beer\n$2.25 Hot Sake\n$4.00 Saketini\n$1.50 Small Beer\n$2.00 Sake Bomb\n\nSushi & Pupu (Appetizer) Brunch: AYCE sushi plus Hawaiian pupu menu for $20.95\nSundays: 11:30 AM - 3:00 PM
