I'm not a communist. I'm a Yelper. I worked hard for every ruble I got. So, you buy your own cocktail because the propganda is real. Red Square has infiltrated the Mandalay Bay in Vegas ... and I'm a fan of drinking like a Russian.\n\nBetter off Red than thirsty. \n\nA Moscow Mule (of course) for me and a fruity KGB Cocktail with Ketel One Vodka for her were reasons enough to join the red revolution, but a Cabbage-wrapped Meatball and Salmon & Salmon Roe Flatbread made this conspiracy a reality of my indoctrination. \n\nConsider this my own personal Yelp manifesto to proclaim that all good Yelpers should visit the Red Square ... not for communism (except for a couple IG pics), but for cold crisp Vodka.\n\nScarface Tony Montoya would warn, \n\"You a Yelper, huh? How you like it, man? They tell you all the time where to go, what to eat, what to drink. Do you wanna be like a sheep? Like all those other Yelp Elite? Baah! Baah! \"\n\nBe a sheep. Be a comrade. Be a Yelper.
