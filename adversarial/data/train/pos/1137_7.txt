This was probably the worst service I've ever received at a restaurant.  It took almost five minutes, after being seated, to be given menus.  I order water for myself, my husband and my two year old daughter.  Now I understand that this isn't necessarily a \"kid restaurant\" but the place was crawling with children, so I was VERY surprised when our waitress brought out a pint glass of water for my daughter.  I spent the rest of the time trying to help her with the glass.  Since we rarely saw our waitress, there wasn't a chance to ask for a different cup.  After sitting there for over half an hour, the waitress came out to inform my husband that they were out of part of his meal.  She offered to substitute it for something else but gave no suggestions for substitutions.  We found this weird since we had placed our order quite a bit before this and they were just getting to our order?  After FORTY-FIVE minutes, and my daughter asking and apparently being overhead by other waitresses that she was hungry, we received our food.  No apologies for the delay or anything, just simply handed our food.   When we were given our ticket, my husband noticed that the time stamp for when the order was placed was less than fifteen minutes prior to it being brought out, meaning our waitress didn't put the order in until we had been sitting there for over half an hour.  \nI would definitely NOT recommend this place.
