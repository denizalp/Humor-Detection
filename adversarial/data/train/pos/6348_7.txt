As long as the flight leaves on time and arrives safely to its destination, things are A-OK with me.   How anyone who leaves close to on-time and arrives safely could give an airline a 1-star review is beyond my ability to comprehend.  What do you give if something goes wrong?  If You sit on the tarmac?  The toilet overflows on your 5 hour flight?  There are no negative-star reviews.  *shrugs*\n\nFrom Phoenix, I am satisfied with the gate attendants and the service I have received on my flights in and out of PHX.
