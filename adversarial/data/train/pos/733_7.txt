Met a friend here for some day drinking and cocktails. They have a few beers on tap including some locals and some from a little further away. I enjoyed my Wicked Weed Lunatic Blonde and OMB Captain Jack. The cheese plate was very nicely done and the mustard was excellent.\n\nThey brew their own spirits here. The vodka was excellent.\n\nNice spot to sit with chairs here and there in smaller and slightly larger groups. A neat hangout if you're looking for something other than simply beer from one of the great local breweries.
