Been here several times for different reasons. First time was to get me a Seattle Seahawks #3 Russel Wilson jersey. Second time was to get a Seattle Seahawks Super Bowl 48 Championship hat.\n\nFor the Wilson jersey, they seem to always have it in sizes of medium or large. I needed an extra large. It seems that every time I talk to whoever is behind the counter, they tell me the same thing, \"Oh we don't know when the next shipment is coming in and it also depends on if the sport is in season.\" Well, the two times I came here in season they never have my size. I ended up ordering it at another sport place because shipping was free and it only cost 85 bucks instead of the marked up price of 125 here.\n\nFor the Super Bowl 48 Championship Hat, they did have it. Apparently they only made that one style of an adjustable cap and with the brim curved (I like my hats with the brim flat). I guess I didn't have a choice but since it was a championship hat, I made an exception.\n\nService is almost non existent here. Whenever I show up, I always end up talking to the guy behind the counter because there usually isn't an associate walking around helping out. Does that second person always go on a break every time I show up? So its usually just one person manning the whole store whenever I go there. Weird.\n\nSo in closing, you wont always find what you're looking for here and when you do, its usually not the right size. I give them 3 stars only because the other stores in the mall you get pretty much the same experience. \n\nYelp 2014 365 Review Challenge #53
