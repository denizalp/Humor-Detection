First, make sure that you are at the clinic on 1700 Exchange and not the store\/adoption center. I made this first mistake when I was taking my puppy Misha for her surgery. \n\nI LOVED working with them to get Misha spayed. They were extremely pleasant and helpful when setting up my appointment. They had a high quality service for the low cost of fixing a pet. \n\nHow it works-drop off your beloved little one off in the morning in before work in between 7:30-8am. When you first enter the clinic there is a set of clipboards with necessary paperwork attached. Everyone at the clinic is extremely efficient and gets you in and out quickly. I think I spent a total of 7 minutes when dropping off Misha. \n\nOne of a Kind has centered their service around working parents. Pets stay the entire day after being dropped off. This made my work day extremely less stressful. After 4:30 but before 6 is when you pick up your pet. They are just as fabulous with pick up as they are with drop off. They have \"goodie\" bags for every parent with instructions and information about your pet's post op. When I came to pick up Misha they all knew who it was I was picking up. While I'd like to think it was because my dog is so cute and lovable (like all pet parents do) but  they seemed to know the dogs of other customers as well. \n\nOther great things:\n1. If you have any issues post op, you can just call in and they will answer any questions you have. They have an emergency 24 hour line as well as a vet on site that will check out your pet for no extra cost. \n2. They also do microchipping for only $25.
