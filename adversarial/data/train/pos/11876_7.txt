6:20 pm: Ordered two ridiculously simple pizzas (1 small deep dish pepperoni, 1 small thin crust cheese) online, the confirmation code said we could expect it delivered by 7:11. \nAt 7:45, we called the store and were told the delivery driver was on his way with our order. \n8:05, we called back. Snarky phone guy asked us if we were sure we actually ordered online, then if we were sure we ordered from the Montford location, before retaking our order and telling us that we had to present our confirmation code at the door before getting our pizzas that we'd have to wait ANOTHER 45 minutes for... although our order was supposedly already prepared and out for delivery. We finally got our food around 9:30 pm.\n\nI don't understand what took so long for such a simple order on a Sunday, or why we were met with such suspicion over our order. Did someone at Jet's get a little hungry and hope we wouldn't notice when dinner never came?\nThese questions may never be answered, but one thing is for sure: if there's anything I love more than being hungry, it's having to jump through hoops for the food I've already been charged for! Thanks, Jet's!
