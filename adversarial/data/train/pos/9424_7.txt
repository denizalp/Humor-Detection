So very sad. \n\n All the great reviews here on Yelp gave me a real desire to check Rollin Smoke out.  I thought I would be in BBQ heaven.  Sadly, my mouth ended up in another place!\n\nThe joint is cool, the staff are friendly, but the BBQ sadly was dry and way too over spiced.  I mean it was too dang hot.  It was so peppery hot that all you could taste was pepper and more pepper.\n\nWe had the $35 combo and man it was a lot of food.  Too bad it was all heat on a plate.\n\nOK, I get it, some like it hot, but man, who wants to burn out all their mucous membranes to eat some BBQ?  I understand heat, but the heat took away from the taste.  There was no subtly at all, it was just smokey hot and unpleasant.  \n\nTo me, great BBQ is a balance between just the right amount of heat, smoke and some sweet to offset the heat.  There just wasn't any balance.\n\nBesides that, things were dry.  Not dry like cardboard (except for those nasty slider buns), but the meats were dried out, especially the brisket.\n\nI wanted to like this place so much.  But sorry, once was more than enough for me.
