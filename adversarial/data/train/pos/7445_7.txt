I always get the Shang Beef Noodle with Knife-shaved Noodles. The portion is just right for me, not too much where I feel glutinous and not too little that I'm still hungry. I love the fresh noodle and the knife-shave texture. The beef is soft and not tendon-y. The broth is flavor. There isn't a layer of oil like some other beef noodles I've had. Like other reviews have stated, it is not spicy. (Thank goodness because I can't handle spicy!) However, there is hot sauce on the table if you would like to kick it up a notch!\n\nService is always friendly. Water is refilled often. (Not to mention flavored! This time it had a refreshing cucumber taste.) Food has always been quickly brought out. \n\nEnjoyed the clean and modern feel of the place. \n\nStop in if you're in the mood for a good bowl of noodles. I know I will be back!
