We ended up here on the coldest day of winter following an unfortunate assumption from our part! See, we planned to have some Dim Sum to mark the lunar New Year and since we had business on the south shore we figured; Why not in Brossard? After all, there is a significant Chinese community and we knew two Dim Sum Places. The first one was way overcrowded with 50 groups ahead of us and the other... well, it had closed! There something to be said about planning ahead.\n\nAnyway, being now a bit pressed for time, we ended up here. Nothing really fantastic but the food is good. My son had a Pho which was tasty and the size was quite generous. The same was true for my beef noodle plate. The imperial rolls were passable.\n\nAmbiance is convivial and so was the service. It is a clean and comfortable place and we were happy with experience even though we would not make a detour to come here.
