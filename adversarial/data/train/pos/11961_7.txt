we went to Marcellino since it was recommended to us as one of the finest restaurants in Scottsdale. Not so. It probably is the worst food I have ever tasted. The mozzarella was very rubbery like the one bought from a supermarket. Their signature pasta was thick and bland. The pork medallion was totally inedible and the only good item in our order was the wine.\nAt some point the chef\/owner came to talk and would no go away till we started to get up. This was definitely frendliness bordering on harassment.
