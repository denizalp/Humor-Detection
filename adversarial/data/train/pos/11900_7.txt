April 14th 2010\n\n  This is seriously the best Chinese food I have had... no joke!  I came in with a group of friends (we have all been here numerous times prior and just can't seem to stay away).  Here's the scoop:\n\nOrdered:\n Pot Stickers (8)  $6.95\n Spicy Salt Squid $8.25\n Baked Pork Chop w\/ Spicy Salt $8.25\n Sweet & Sour Chicken $8.25\n House Special Crispy Noodle $6.95\n Shrimp Fried Rice $7.50\n Ice water\n\nPros:  \n* Service is extremely fast (even when it's busy) & accurate w\/ the order.\n* Generous portions and decently priced\n* Awesome Chinese food... I love it!\n\nCons:\n* My favorite dishes (see below) are missing from the Lunch Specials\n* There's a \"house special\" board in the restaurant, but I can't read it because it is written in Mandarin (or perhaps Cantonese...I'm not sure exactly which it is).\n\nTips:\n* We didn't order it this time, but definitely try the Baked Pork Chops with Chef Sauce... It is to die for!  A perfect combo of sweetness and crunch that I can't get enough of.\n\n* Lunch Specials run from 11 am- 3 pm and only comes Steam Rice\n\n* This place is a little hard to find, but look for Sonny's Saloon.  Diamond Chinese is connected.\n\n* ask for their hot sauce.. mmmmmmm\n\n*  Yes they cater!\n\nFinal Verdict:\n  This place is a must!  I'm a big fan of Chinese cuisine, but this place just stands out to me.  I haven't had a dish that I  didn't like from Diamond (not to mention the food is not overly oily like most of its' competitors).  My favorites and \"must haves\" include: the Houes Special Crispy Noodle (AMAZING!!!!), Baked Pork Chops w\/ Chef Sauce (this sauce makes this dish!), and the Spicy Salt Squid.  Aside from the food, the service here is amazing as well.  The server always recognizes me (even if I have not gone in for months).  She always remembers that I'm a big fan of their hot sauce (which appears to be a homemade concoction of sorts mainly composed of Sriracha) and that I like to have hot tea.  Upon taking my order, she already has both in hand.  It's always nice when places remember their customers.  What can I say... I'm a fan!!
