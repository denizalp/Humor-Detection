BACKGROUND \n\nThe Vig has four locations:\nArcadia, Fillmore, McCormick Ranch, Uptown\n\nThis was my first visit to The Vig Arcadia. \n\nI had to meet a friend for lunch and he chose The Vig. I had heard a lot of great things about The Vig Arcadia, so I had high hopes.\n\nAlthough the atmosphere is super cute and intimate, it borders on too closet-y tiny when the restaurant starts filling up. \n\nSERVICE EXPERIENCE \n\nI got there early, so I sat at the bar and decided to check my phone. My battery was very low, so I asked the bartender to point out the closest outlet, or I suggested she could take my phone, so she could charge it behind the bar. \n\nUnfortunately, the self-proclaimed \"staff manager\" was rude and positional beyond belief, which are literally the only 2 qualities a server doesn't need to have.\n\nMe: \"Hi! I'm m waiting for a friend for lunch, do you mind plugging my phone and I'll have a greyhound.\"\n\n- We don't have outlets. \n\nMe: \"Well, that isn't exactly the true, because everything in this bar is using electricity, including the blender you just used, so what you're really saying is that you can help me, you just don't want to. I find it shocking that an upscale restaurant in Scottsdale doesn't have outlets.\"\n\n- This is Arcadia, not Scottsdale. \n\nAt that point, as she was completely rambling about the difference between Scottsdale and Arcadia, as well as the status of the electrical systems and a fierce desire to convince me that an upscale establishment doesn't have outlets. \n\n\"Obviously, there are outlets in restaurant. Clearly, you just don't WANT to plug in my phone.\"\n\nI asked to speak to the manager, which apparently they didn't have one of those either or she wasn't allowing me access to him. \n\nI did still had hope that she might serve me that greyhound. \n\nAnyway, my friend arrived and we moved from the bar to a table. \n\nThen, the second part seems almost like were at another bar altogether. \n\nA new waitress cheerily gave us waters, told us the specials, said she would give us a minute, and was gone. \n\nShe came back a minute later and took our order. All the appetizers arrived in minutes. \n\nThe food was delicious. The server was a delight.\n\nTHE MENU\n\nAppetizers\nArtichoke Kale Jalape√±o Dip (which I had)\nSteamed Edamame (which I had)\nGuacamole & Chips (which I had)\nFlatbreads\nNachos\nHot Wings\n\nSalads\nSandwiches \nBurgers\n\nMains:\nVanilla Braised Short Rib Tacos (which I had)\nFish Tacos\nMan n Cheese\nGrilled Salmon\nPad Thai\n\nDesserts\n\nCONCLUSION \n\nI have to say the the vanilla braised short rib tacos are some of the best food I ever put in my mouth. \n\nIt's a shame to see an owner and the chef putting so much effort into making the restaurant a success, lose an extreme amount of business just because of one argumentative server who can leave such a lasting impression on customers. \n\n4\/5 RECOMMEND \n\nOF NOTE\n\n*There is limited parking out front. \nValet service is available. \n\n*Hours:\nSat\/Sun 10am - 2am\nMon - Thur 11am - 2am\n\n*For more information: thevig.us
