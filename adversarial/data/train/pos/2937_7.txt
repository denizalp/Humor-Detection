I've been a little apathetic with my reviews lately, but really feel inclined to write one for this place given the extremely awesome experience we had here over the weekend. When it comes to a holistic dining experience Echo & Rig executed perfectly on all aspects of what \"I\" (just my humble opinion; others are entitled to their own...) deem as important when eating out.\n\nThis place is a restaurant\/bar\/butcher shop. As you walk in you can see them butchering meat behind the counter to the right, to the left is a bar with some small tables and upstairs is the dining area. This place sources really high end meat from Snake River Farms and Compart Duroc (pork)!! The customer services was top notch, our waiter was super attentive and we were greeted and checked upon by management before, during and after our meal. The food was excellent; since this was a butcher shop we chose to order some non-traditional cuts such as the ring of rib eye and the bevette (hope I didn't butcher the name; pun intended...). Steaks, small plates, salad and drinks were beyond excellent. The waiter recommended the portobello fries and they were delicious. We also ordered the grilled octopus, kennebec salt & pepper fries (same potatoes In & Out uses), broccolini and shared a Caesar salad. Everything we ordered was cooked to perfection and tasted great. I'd say this is the best dinning experience that I had in the last year (we eat out often). \n\nThis place is unique because it is very evident they are extremely focused on working with most fresh and \"best\" ingredients, their customer service second to none, the environment is lively, elegant and welcoming, and the prices are reasonable (compared to \"Vegas Strip\" prices). \n\nMy new steakhouse\/restaurant in Vegas is no longer Mastro's, it is Echo & Rig (we may still go there for the Butter Cake LOL). THERE! I SAID IT!!!! STANDING OVATION...
