A yard drink....or half yard...or Pilsner (if you're trying to watch your alchie\/sugar intake) is a MUST get in Vegas.  Adult Slurpees for sure.  It's a win win, it cools you off and gets you buzzed.  I got the Mango Pilsner for $11 and my friend treated me to a Cosmo Mother Pucker shot served in a test tube ($2 each).  \n\nBf got his 190 Octane, which is made of Everclear, at the MGM location which gave him a very good buzz.  I had a few sips of it, I could taste the alchie in it more than in my drink but it still tasted fruity.  I knew I couldn't handle all that Everclear, because unfortunately I'm a lightweight.  But I love their assorted flavors & variety of cup sizes I can get.  \n\nFat Tuesday is a Vegas staple and probably the best place that you can get your yard drink at.
