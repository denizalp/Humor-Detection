Came here for winterlicious ($28) and I actually quite enjoyed the food. However, we were seated at a corner table and barely had any service all night. We were constantly thirsty and there were so few servers working that we couldn't even flag anyone down. We ended up being there for 3 hours because the courses came out so slowly.\n\nI still enjoyed the experience though. Quality of food was good, and it's one of the better winterlicious meals I've had, and for a very reasonable price. The calamari app was spot on. The main I had the grilled fish, which was good (texture more rough but I think that's the texture of the fish itself and not how it was cooked), and dessert custard tart fell below expectations.\n\nAtmosphere is fancy, and six of us shared a bottle of wine.
