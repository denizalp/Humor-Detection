This is my second night here and second room. \n\nRoom number 1) \n*Bathroom door would not open from the inside because it would fall off the tracks if you closed it completely. \n\n*Went pee in the middle of the night and when I flushed the water started to overflow from the tank \n\n*Woke up with little bug bite looking bumps on my leg, stomach, and one over my eyebrow. Doesn't look like bed bug bites. But concerning none the less. \n\n*In the morning, I advised the front desk agent of the toilet issue (this little old blonde lady who was about as pleasant as the overflowing toilet in the middle of the night). I also told her about the door getting stuck. I informed her that my colleague was still in there so if they could check it out later I'd appreciate it. \nNo apology, just an \"okay\". Told her about the possible bug bites and she handed me a business card and told me to take pictures and email them. Again, no apology. \n\n*Get to my meeting only to have my colleague (we were sharing rooms) ask if I asked engineering to go up in the morning. Apparently, the engineer knocked on the door once, called out \"engineering\" and tried to open the door. She had just finished in the shower and before she could ask \"who is it\" she had to push the door closed before he opened it fully. \n\n\nRoom number 2)\n*Call the front desk because I realized I forgot my toothpaste, face wash, and face wipes in previous room.  Those items had disappeared from the room. \n\n*I poopoo'd (small. Nothing big, no diarrhea. Just small little poopoos). I did not use a crazy amount of toilet paper. Just enough to wipe like a normal person. I flushed, the water filled up the bowl and floated on the edge but as I was washing my hands it went down.\nI go to dinner and come back, I pee, and I flush. Again, just the normal regular lady look like amount of TP. The bowl fills up to the top, I wait, no movement. So I jiggle the handle. The bowl starts filing up some more and now I've got peepee water overflowing onto the bathroom floor. It's about 10:45pm and the last thing I was to do is move rooms again. Both engineering and housekeeping have gone home for the night so I've got a disgusting peepee pool until 7am.\n\n*Bed was instantly itchy as soon as I crawled in. \n\nI can't wait to get of this place.
