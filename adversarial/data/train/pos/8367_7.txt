Went here with a friend who had never been to a Habit.  The cashier was quite knowledgeable on the menu and what the differences were between the original store and this one.  We ordered a couple of cheeseburgers and a side of fries and one of onion rings.  The food was great.  We arrived early and by the time we left there was no inside seating left.  They have a large patio but that is not much help on a December evening.  They have enough floor space they could add a couple of small tables or high tops in the center but at peak it might interfere with folks getting to the condiment\/soda station
