Pamplemousse, or grapefruit in French, is a quaint classical French restaurant in Las Vegas near the main strip. \n\nOur maître d' was a man named Keifer who has been working for the restaurant for many decades. He was able to recite the menu word for word.\n\nFor dinner our group had the following with the rating next to each course:\n5\/5 - Basket of crudites  (large basket of fresh cut vegetables)\n5\/5 - French onion soup - Soupe à l'oignon\n5\/5 - Bruchee de fruit de mar (an assortment of seafood baked in a flaky pastry shell)\n5\/5 - Cassolete of wild forest mushrooms\n4\/5 - Pamplemousse granité (sorbet in champagne)\n4\/5 - Grain fed duck breast & leg confit\n4\/5- Escargot (sans shell)\n4\/5 - Wild seared salmon\n5\/5 - Braised lamb shank \n3\/5 - Tournedos of prime beef\n5\/5 - Belgium dark chocolate mousse\n5+\/5 - Grand marnier souffle\n4\/5 - Chocolate souffle\n\nWe were so stuffed by the 4th course but the souffle was so decadent that we managed to finish everything.\n\nNo, you did not read the price on the menu incorrectly - The 5 course menu is truly $56. OMG! That's unheard of in the Bay Area. I wish I had come here sooner!\n\n6\/5 - Value of the meal
