Dear Rossi's Pizza, \n\nI really like your product, and I'm walking distance from your front door. \n\nHere's the kicker:\n\nAt the top of your menu, you pronounce that you now take credit cards, but then slob on a guilt trip if I decide to use one. \n\nTell ya what, you marketing aces! If you'd left that bit off and joined the real world, or just say cash only, you'd do a lot better.\n\nI think of you guys all the time, and I'd like to buy from you, but in this day and age, I simply don't carry cash. To let me know at the very top of the menu that you're particular about how you're paid is an insult. If you don't trust me or the issuer of my bank card, relax. I'll spare you the risk by not entering your business. Pizza isn't in short supply around here. I hope your banker is a Yelp member. \n\nBest to you! Figger it out!\n\n\nBill
