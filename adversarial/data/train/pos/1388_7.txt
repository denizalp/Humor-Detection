Alright, it's been reviewed, but let's elaborate a bit on Frau's brief descriptors!\n\nVery convenient location:  assuming one lives in Bloordale, sure!  I do, so it's convenient.  The real convenience is that it's next door to Holy Oak, and just down the street from Ali Baba's.  Great!\n\nLots of machines:  Maytag, both front and top loaders, with a bay of dryers that seems ample enough to serve peak times.  The dryers are AWESOME, bordering on too hot, so bear that in mind if you're drying delicates!\n\nLarge tables:  hm, not really -- and one is in the middle of the small space, making for a cramped job if there's more than a couple people doing laundry at one time.  Still, not worth complaining over, merely mentioning.\n\nOther notes:\n\nInexpensive: on par with Coin Rite across the street (my previous laundromat of choice, now sadly a crapfest of broken machines and poor service), with 25cent 6 minute dry cycles that let me micromanage things to my liking.\n\nInconsistent signage\/instructions:  a nitpick, but again worth mentioning -- be careful what soaps\/fluids\/whatever you're putting where, because depending on the machine you might inadvertently screw it up.  I managed this, probably because I'm stupid and wasn't paying attention.  So don't repeat my mistake.\n\nBetter crowd:  if Coin Rite caters to the ne'er-do-wells and degenerates that frighten me, H&H seems to cater to the ne'er-do-wells and degenerates who excite\/amuse\/enrich me.  I've seen many of my favourite bar and cafe employees\/regulars at H&H, which says... something, I'm not sure what.  \n\nProbably that it's next door to Holy Oak and everyone with half a brain and a sense of style really digs that place, so H&H is a convenient place to wash those Value Village finds.
