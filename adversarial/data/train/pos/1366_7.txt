Walked in a virgin laser-er, Walked out as Lara Croft (Or so I thought)\n\nHad so much fun running around in the dark. Went with a bunch of kiddies for a birthday. Didn't book a package, but did the unlimited gaming from 8-Midnight for $19.99 which ended up being a pretty good deal considering we played back to back the entire time. Games typically last about 20 min. at $8 a piece, so I would say unlimited is the best way to go.\n\nInitially I thought I would just hang out and kill time in the nice lil' snack-bar\/arcade area, but in the end I was glad I opted to play. The game proved to be quite an enjoyable work out, but you can also find joy in taking it easy in a dark hidden corner and shooting secretly from there, if you so choose. Either way, you can't go wrong with this place. My favorite part was the final play of the night in which we had a free for all. Every man for himself. It's the best way to play in my opinion and the guy even let the game run on a tad bit longer, which I thought was mighty cool of him. \n\nDefinitely consider this place for an out of the norm night-o-fun, but be sure to check the website for specials first as it seems they have quite a few throughout the week.
