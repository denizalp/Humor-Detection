Effortless and satisfying, AGAIN. \n\nStraightforward menu, a six-course for $105\/pp or a 3 course of your choosing for $95\/pp. Being the gluttons that we are, we pick the six course. \n\nAmuse: A trio of canapes, all excellent, my favorite was the lobster w\/guac. \nC1: Tuna Tartare, solid subtle flavors \nC2: Rock Shrimp & Ricotta Ravioli, I literally stuck my face in this to sniff \nC3: Sea Bass, beautiful crispy skin-one of the best preparations ever \nC4: Surf & Turf, more lobster, foie & filet, my heart almost stopped \nC5: Roquefort Cheese w\/apple, fantastic cheese and perfect portion \nC6: FULL sized desserts, three of 'em, green tea creme brulee w\/pistachio ice cream, chocolate cake & a lemon parfait. \n\nI asked for the ATRIUM seating, was corrected, it's the SWAN COURT, they have FOUR swans outside for your viewing pleasure. Quite a pleasant experience, I'm all about simultaneous stimulation. \n\nTasting menu + wine pairing, tip\/tax, a steal at under $500.
