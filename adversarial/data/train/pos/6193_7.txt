Best. Korean. Chicken Wings. Ever.\n\nYou can find this spot right next to the ever popular Q Karaoke. Parking kind of sucks in this plaza as well.\n\nThe waiter started us off with the traditional Korean side dishes, always my favorite part of the Korean dining experience.\nNot sure if the side dishes change from time to time like other restaurants, but this time, we got:\n- Tofu skin: SO GOOOOOD! I couldn't stop eating this\n- Weenies: pretty good.. they were hot dog weenies in a sauce mixture of ketchup and hot sauce\n- Noodles: Love it\n- Macaroni salad: not a huge fan of them usually but this was good\n\nThey were having a special of buy 2 get 1 draft beer free, with your choices being Blue Moon, Coors Light, Asahi, and something else. We all got two rounds of Asahi which went very well with our dinner.\n\nWe ordered 20 pieces of wings for 5 people. We chose the flavors \"supreme\" and \"soy garlic.\" If you want to know how \"supreme\" tastes, I found that our waiter described the supreme flavor very very accurately, \"it's sweet but sour, and on a spicy level of 1 to 10, it's like a 4.\"\n\nThe soy garlic flavor was very good! The supreme was great as well but was actually too spicy for me. I was only able to eat one or two (note: radishes are great palette cleansers!).\n\nWe ordered another dish to share but it ended up being too spicy for the entire table and I wasn't a fan of the strong kimchi taste so I only had 1-2 bites.\n\nFor dessert, we received the 1 free shaved for the table. The size of the shaved ice was enough for the 5 of us. I actually wasn't a fan of the shaved ice really. It had strawberries and bananas to top it off along with (vanilla?) ice cream. The flavor of the shaved ice was mango or melon or a combination of something too sweet for my taste. I wouldn't get it again unless it was free.\n\nOverall, good experience, and would come back again for the beer and wings.
