Sometimes I wonder what possesses people to review things on Yelp. \n\nThe Eaton Centre Skybridge is neither a good nor a service. \n\nIt promotes the flow of traffic, and commerce, yet no money changes hands here unless some friendly street musician or unfriendly homeless dude sits soliciting quarters along the span. \n\nArguably, it is not even a place in and of itself; it is, as Faulkner would say, a space to fill a lack.\n\nA River Styx between the Bay and the posthumously-named Eaton Centre.\n\nA rainbow bridge to shopping Asgaard.\n\nA purgatory where shoppers await redemption by redeeming their scratch and save tickets. \n\nA retail Gehonim, where one seeks the ritual purification of the perfume-spritzing salesladies. \n\nIt smells of pee and disappointment. \n\nIn summer and winter, it's unbearably hot. \n\nSo why review it?\n\nBecause it's 3:30 PM on Friday, and it just popped up on my feed.
