Yelp's 365 Review Challenge 2014 #302 - #365.                \n\nWe were staying at Encore just a 2 minute walk north of our hotel and wanted a budget friendly breakfast. So we decide to eat at America's favorite diner, \"Denny's!\"\n\nThe restaurant was packed and we only waited for 10 minutes before getting called. Our server was friendly as well as the rest of the staff. I ordered the Grand Slam and orange juice, the food was just ok in my book. We were always checked on for refills and if the food was cooked perfectly. I like how the staff goes out of their way to please the customer. \n\nIf I'm staying at the Encore again, I'll be sure to come back to this Denny's location for an affordable breakfast and good service. I know the food in Encore will cost an arm and a leg!
