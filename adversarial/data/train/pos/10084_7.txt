One word sums this place up. GHETTO! The other reviews were right on the money. I'm not gonna lie, I was scarred! So I suggest buying your tickets ahead of time to get the best rate. I also highly suggest paying the extra 5 bucks to get priority seating and sit up front. And watch your seat- if you leave it empty, you will get jacked.\nBe forewarned- people stink! Apparently other passengers don't believe in showers or deodorant. A can of Lysol may help.\nI'm giving 2 stars instead of 1 because the bus did arrive to destination on time both times I used the bus, and the second driver was very cool and funny.
