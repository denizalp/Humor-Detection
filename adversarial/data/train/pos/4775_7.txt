I got married in this chapel, of course it was not my first choice.. I would have prefered Bellagio or The Venetian chapels, but given the prices of those and my budget the Treasure Island was the best choice, so I do highly recommend it, the staff was really friendly  and the flowers beautiful. I got the LEGACY WEDDING CEREMONY Package and was worth every penny, Cashman does your Photos they take ALOT of them during and after the ceremony, then when you are all done they make an apointment with you (if you will be in the city next day) so you can go and choose ur pics, of course you can buy extras but wow are they pricey (average $15 per pic) or if you cant be there they give you a web address where you can pick and buy any extra pics you want (and the ones that come with ur package are sent to your house).\nWell I went on and on about the photos and didnt really describe the chapel sorry... there really isnt much to it, its small and pretty.\nAny more Q's that you have send me an email, Ill be glad to help.
