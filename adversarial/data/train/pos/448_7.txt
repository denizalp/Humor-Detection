This is my favorite place in the burgh to get a delicious meal under $10. I get the same thing every time: a chicken soft burrito and an order of yuca fries. \n\nThe burritos are hilariously large, but there's nothing funny about the pure deliciousness that will dance on your tongue. How is the chicken so good? Is this even real life? Yes, my friend this is the reality of Chicken Latino. \n\nThe yuca fries are just as delicious. They are crispy on the outside and dense on the inside and I could probably eat them for every meal and never tire of them. Do yourself a favor and mix some of the homemade green sauce with some mayo, then use that concoction as a dip for the fries. \n\nYou're welcome.
