Mark's Cleaning just left our house, and boy howdy!  Looks like we just bought NEW carpet.  After they did some great but minor spot cleaning, I had been meaning to have them back for the whole shootin' match.  I dragged my feet, though, and then my dog dragged his butt, and, well.  It was time.\n\nI honestly considered just tearing the carpet out and starting over.  The great guys at Mark's, though, assured me they could get all the pee-stains and various tracked-in debris out, and they did just that.  I just keep walking around, staring at it.  \n\nI may ask them to try to clean the carpet in the barn, that my neighbors tore out of THEIR house last summer.  Rental property, here we come!\n\n\n\"Laughter and tears are both responses to frustration and exhaustion. I myself prefer to laugh, since there is less cleaning up to do afterward.\"\n\nKurt Vonnegut
