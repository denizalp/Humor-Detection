DO NOT give all your personal information until they can give you an absolute answer that they can assist you. I just tried to schedule a court mandated mental health assessment; gave them all my insurance information, and was told to call back in an hour to see if my insurance will cover it. After an hour of waiting, called back and they said \"they don't get involved with that kind of stuff\". Meaning, they don't deal with court mandated assessment. Just wasted an hour and now they have all my personal information. The receptionist said she didn't know! UNACCEPTABLE!
