This was the far the worst experience of my shopping at M.K. with rude cashiers and a manager named Jamie. \n\nBuyers, please be aware and check your receipt!!! The store charges you $114 taged priced item as $129 on their system. Charging each customer $15 more is a scam!\n\nWhen I told the cashier the scanned price is wrong, she ignored me and asked me to pay for it anyways. After I checked my receipt carefully, I was able to find the error and pointed it out to the cashier. She never apologized for her mistake but try to blame the system. Really???\n\nIf a customer complaints about an error, the cashier's response SHOULD be re- checking of the price tag and adjusting the scanned price, instead of ignoring the customer. \n\nShe was just so busy pulling down her shirt from her shoulder instead of caring for her responsibilities. The manager, Jamie,  was worse, he threatened to kick me out of the store for asking them about overcharging their other customers. \n\nThe manager said it is an honest mistake,  but really??? I saw at least 3 other customers buying the same purse as I waited in line with ignorant cashier. I am pretty sure they make money scamming their customers.
