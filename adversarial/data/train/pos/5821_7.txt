OK Peeps, let's get it straight-this place is not Tex-Mex or Jamaican, its Costa Rican style food.  Whenever you see \"tico\" on anything, it refers to Costa Rica.  Plus cornbread made from heaven and collard greens for randomness.\n\nWhen I visited RC, I was suprised by the daring mix of Costa Rican food and Southern food.  The smell of rotisserie chicken makes my heart sing, anyway, but it was even better to eat.  For around $8, I got an entire meal of rotisserie chicken, black beans, and spinach.  I ordered spinach to be healthy (must have been sick or something) and was shocked at how good  it tasted!  Not to mention the chicken...\n\nThis place is very homely-located above a rowdy Karaoke bar.  I applaud them for being so deliciously weird.  A salsa bar (as in sauce for tortilla chips, not the music), collard greens, mac n cheese, and tico beans?  The client√®le is awesomely mixed as well, young, old, hip and square.  This place is proof that Charlotte does have its own gastronomical character.
