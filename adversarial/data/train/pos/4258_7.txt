My aunt choose this place because she claimed it was the only place that offered mani pedis and waxing in one place for a decent price. (honestly, i dont think she searched hard enough). This place is a total dump. Soon as I walked in I instantly noticed the carpet and walls needed some serious cleaning. The place was packed since it was a Friday afternoon. I didn't want the mani pedi just a full set done. They went a head and got my aunt into the foot bath while I was seated at a table waiting to be done. Nearly an hour and a half later my aunt was completely finished; hands, toes, and brows waxed; and I still hadn't even been started. I just said forget it and left. They seemed surprised that I didn't want to wait even longer for a nail tech. Of course now they see they were loosing a customer they said one could now start me. But honestly I was just tired of being in there, finding all the stains on everything. They did a good job with the services my aunt got but still....I told my aunt never to go back there....but of course she did :(
