If you need to eat gluten free then this is the place for you. It's really a grab and go bakery but they sell cakes, muffins, loaves, etc. Just about you name it. They now have vegan choices on some of their items which have a small letter \"v\" next to it.\n\nI was looking at the almond raspberry cupcake. The counter lady told me it was made using applesauce as opposed to eggs. I got one and was delighted to find that it had a raspberry preserve filling just to give it enough flavor. Course at $3.95 one would expect to pay more for both gluten free and vegan. I decided to eat it there and was pleased with the taste and that it was not too filling.\n\nYou can order cakes here but I wasn't real interested in that. Nice place to come to if you find yourself on Murray Ave in Squirrel Hill. Located near the Giant Eagle I am glad to find another place that offers both gluten free and vegan options for grab and go.
