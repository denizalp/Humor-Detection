I was not that impressed. Ok, bear with me. Let me tell you a little story. \n\nMy family loves Mexican food. I think I've finally convinced them to forgo On the Border for some better fare. Well, since they were in the Scottsdale area one Saturday afternoon, I thought we'd try Los Sombreros. I said I'd meet them there. Good thing I brought the book I was reading (Summer People by Brian Groh - fantastic). My family was running late, and I discovered that it's a little hard to serve food when you're closed on a busy weekend day. Saturday afternoon? Closed? You're kidding me... Well, I took a spot on a bench and read. Lucky for me, I could text a friend to consider other possibilities in the area. Los Olivos was where we ended up. (Ugh. Don't get me started on that place.) \n\nANYHOW, I thought I'd give Los Sombreros another chance. I met my text-savvy friend the next evening for dinner. I arrived and snatched up a table on the patio. The hostess said it was the most popular table. Go figure, even if it's by all the little propane tanks surrounding the palms. I quickly ordered a Lager and drank happily while I waited. The menu presented a little bit of a challenge. Resist the amazing-looking entrees for dinner (and spare myself $17) or just splurge? I went with the fish tacos, since that's what the waiter recommended. What I got was not expected. Three mini tacos that were a challenge to eat. They reminded me of the signature dish you'd get at Pink Taco. I wasn't impressed. Later that evening, my tummy wasn't impressed, either. \n\nSo, would I go back? Eh. Maybe. I'd like my family to try this place during operating hours. If I go back, I'll get one of their more appealing dishes, like the lamb or crab. They definitely surprise you with their take on Mexican cuisine. I like the looks of the menu. I just hope not everything they serve leaves me wanting, like those messy, greasy and so-so tacos did. \n\n3 stars for Los Sombrerors.\n5 stars for Summer People.
