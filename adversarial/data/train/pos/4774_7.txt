This place is just straight up filthy. How am I suppose to eat at a buffet when almost every plate had leftovers on them. Like I'm not even kidding. Even the workers, not even properly dressed and in the very back you can see them on their phones. In. Plain. Sight. Tables were sticky, had to ask for a new washed spoon and fork. Will not be returning. This place is just poorly run. And don't even get me STARTED about the bathrooms..
