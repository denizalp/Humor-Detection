Not bad Lai Lai, I definitely have to give kudos to the customer service the owner at the register was super nice and made sure we received an authentic chinese menu to come back and try a dish. This alone deserves a full star . \n\nMmmmmm, they have Chow fun , not many chinese  take out spots have the yummy Chow fun noodles , gotta get that next time . I ordered the curry chicken and it was good, could've used a little sugar to balance the flavors ,but it wasnt bad . I loved that the to go box wasn't packed with unnecessary amounts of rice . Perfect portion sizes for your Chinese food craving . The spring roll actually  had flavor and wasn't just bland cabbage stuffed into an egg roll wrapper . Food wasn't greasy , and personally loved the spiciness in this dish .
