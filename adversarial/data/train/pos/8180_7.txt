Like my tip said, \"IM FREAKING OUT MAN!\"\n\nThey make subs so fast you'll freak! That is one of their mottos. Yes it does hold true.\n\nI ordered the #10 Hunter's Club because I love roast beef and this sandwich has the most they pack from all of their choices. Everything was good from when you order all the way up to when you receive your food. They have an assembly line style of system, that's why they can make your food fast. \n\nFor you first timers, here's the breakdown. All their sandwiches are 8 inches long. Now from the sandwich choices you have numbers 1 through 6 which is just your basic sandwiches with everything in it. (refer to their website for descriptions of each sandwich. Didnt wanna do it here because I know you dont wanna waste your time reading this). Numbers 7 through 17 are sandwiches that have twice the meat and\/or twice the cheese. You also have slim sandwiches which are any sandwich choice minus the veggies and sauce. For you carb conscious folks they have the JJ Unwich. Everything is the same except it's wrapped in lettuce instead of it being inside the bread. And finally, you have their ultimate sandwich called the JJ Gargantuan. Get this only if you are really hungry.\n\nSo once you decide what category you want, the choices get much easier since you wil decide based on how really hungry you are.\n\nI gave these guys 4 stars because of the really fast service and pretty good sandwiches. The only reason its not 5 stars because any time I want a sandwich, I think of something hot, like cheesesteak or meatball or turkey with melted cheese. So JIMMY, if you are reading this, I NEED A HOT SANDWICH! \n\nSo for their complete menu, (and maybe some of you agree with me on a hot sandwich so be my guest if you wanna chime in as well) www.jimmyjohns.com
