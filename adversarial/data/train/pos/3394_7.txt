What is up with that smell? Are you guys pumping perfume through the vents? That shit was choking me all night. I guess it was worth the $400 I took from you.\n\nThe cafe is decent. It's way over-priced, but the servings can fill two people.\n\nI didn't stay here, but my friend did and his rooms were pretty nice, but he's rich, so whatever.
