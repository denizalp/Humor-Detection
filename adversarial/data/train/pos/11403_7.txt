Let me start by saying the food has always been good in the past but last night was not a great experience. We started off with the idea that we would go for happy hour.... until we saw we either had to eat at the bar or on hi- tops so we decided to take advantage of the two for one offer and ate in the dining room. Our friends wanted apps, salad, drinks etc and we wanted small and simple so being sensitive, they asked for 2 separate checks. For some reason (which made no sense to any of us) our waiter said he couldn't do that. No explanation given. He was quite abrupt and sarcastic.  As far as the food, the tortellini was great but the butternut squash ravioli was not up to par. I'm just giving two stars because of the waiter and his attitude but for the food I would give it 4.
