Sooooo, Barbi is hilarious, sweet, beautiful, accommodating and just overall amazing. She is a gem among her peers. Here is why:\n\nI needed a quick set of nails because I've been slammed, and I'm about to head out on vacation.  I messaged her on Yelp, and she was super fast to respond. She got me in the same day and even stayed late to accommodate. Wow. That was already a sign of amazing customer service. Then I let her know that I was going to be a few minutes late. Again, quick response and it was no problem. Get to the salon, and she was immediately warm and welcoming. We chit chatted it up and had a grand ole time. \n\nAnd of course, onto the nails. I normally don't get my nails done. I should, in my line of work, but I'm too lazy and cheap. Barbi is so good at what she does, she even explains the process and it really shows how much she cares that her clients are happy with her work. My nails look and feel amazing. And she's extremely reasonable. \n\nI just really wanted to praise her for how awesome she is. Best I've found in town, and I'm so happy she's super close to my work!\nThanks again, Barbi!
