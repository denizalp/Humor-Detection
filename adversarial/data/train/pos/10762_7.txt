I swore the last couple times I've been here I said to myself never again. Komol used to be my favorite Thai Restaurant in town at one time. They used to deliver to my work, so I ate their food frequently. The last few times I've been there I have noticed the food isn't as good as it used to be. \n\nWe went there last night, had a reservation, when we arrived the employees were running around like crazy. The place was busy, but not anything crazier than I've seen it before. \n\nWe are seated and wait for awhile for someone to take our orders. She finally comes and we are both famished. Had we known what was about to transpire, we would've ordered our entrees. So we eat our salad, and she comes to take out entree order. We waited ONE HOUR for our food to arrive. I was so hungry I was close to walking out. Then, my entree arrives. Mine only. The waitress leaves the table. Doesn't say a word about my friends dish. I sit patiently staring at my food. We call her over to see what's going on and she says \"it will be out soon\". So I'm sitting there patiently for my friends food to arrive, where I come from it's rude to eat without everyone having their entree. Ten minutes later it arrives. My Pad Kee Mao was less than stellar. I ate the shrimp out of it and left everything else. Needless to say, I won't be going back.
