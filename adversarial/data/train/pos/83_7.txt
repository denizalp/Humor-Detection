If you have not been to Freddie's yet, you messed up. This place is unreal. It looks like a dirty garage when inside. Most people will be turned off by the interior or even the outside of the building. It is probably about the same as food warehouses in America. There is no such thing as \"clean\", this is Planet Earth. Get over yourself. You are a filthy inhabitant of this planet no different than a cockroach. If you think this place is a hole, you are right. This whole universe is a hole. So eat at Freddie's and get an authentic Cleveland made Polish Boy! The guy who works there is really nice.
