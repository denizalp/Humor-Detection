The worst possible yogurt place we had set foot on , We walked in and the place looked new ,  modern with all this screens showing the flavors and 2 separate areas for toppings  nice bright orange walls and metal chairs . It made the place look nice but it had a weird smell but we didnt care much  and decided to give it a try . Worst mistake ! \n\nAs soon as we walked in we noticed a guy sitting down with his laptop and looking  as if he was the owner but we didn't make anything of it  so  me and mother in law grabbed our frozen yogurt ,they didn't have that many flavors  to begin with , then we got our toppings and sat  to \"enjoy\"\nAs we sat down  we saw the cashier sat down with the guy and we noticed that  he was her boyfriend  . It got uncomfortable when another customer walked in so the cashier stand up with her boyfriend at the exit and kissed , the customer with her daughter just payed and left .   When we took a bite to indulge on our yogurt all of our toppings  tasted nasty , the fruit tasted sour  as if it had sat there for a long time and my mother in-laws cookies and nuts were  stale then i took a bite of my gummy  bears and they were so hard it was like biting into a rock and they werent even touching the frozen yogurt .  Long story short  we just left it , we didn't even finished it it was just bad all the way around . The girl was nice but so unprofessional for customers to see loving affection and bad for business . The guy went outside for a bit to smoke right o. The tables outside   , he didnt even went through the back door . \n\nFor sure not coming back to this place ever .  No wonder it was empty
