I happened upon this restaurant one day and tried it and it seemed great so I decided to give it another shot...\nI did the mistake of getting takeout and when I got home and started to look at the food I sensed something wasn't right..\nI ordered the Ginger beef and it was pure Ginger... And the chicken balls were hard as stone not to mention the sweet and sour sauce tasted like ketchup..\nWe called them up to tell them about the beef and they could of cared less, they didn't seem to care at all actually.\nIf you go here stay away from the Ginger beef.\nThis place is just your average Chinese restaurant, nothing special but not horrible either.
