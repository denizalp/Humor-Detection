You know how in movies you have a meet cute? Where the two main characters meet and instantly feel a connection? Well, that's what I had with this place. We were perusing Mile end on a Sunday Morning and walking down St. Laurent, when all of a sudden, I come across open doors leading to a wall of carbs. We immediately stepped in. And the rest is history. \n\nSo the first time we came here, we just got an almond croissant and a mini chocolate croissant. This almond croissant is the best croissant I've ever had, IN MY LIFE. They cut it in half and load it with some sort of almondy\/buttery spread and douse it in more almonds, and cover the croissant in almonds. It's the most almondy treat and it is flakey and amazing and just everything you would want in a pastry. The mini chocolate croissant was also decadent, and even though it was mini it packed a TON of chocolate in there, and it was warm and melty. Lord hammercy.\n\nOn our last day in Montreal we stopped here once more, because I couldn't stop thinking about it. We got the almond croissant (again, obvs), the white chocolate mushroom-shaped brioche, the large cheese bread, and a small cheese\/rosemary bread. EVERYTHING IS SO GOOD! The large cheese bread is soft (even after like, four days) and filled with cheddar, and the white chocolate mushroom-shaped brioche was fluffy and not too sweet. The rosemary cheese bread was heavenly and had a perfect balance of herb and cheese. I just loved everything.\n\nWhen I come back to Montreal you better believe I'll be stacking myself with all the breads from here, and I can't wait to try new ones. They only take canadian dollars or canadian debit.
