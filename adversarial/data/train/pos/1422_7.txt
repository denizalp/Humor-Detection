As a breast Cancer survivor and one who recently had to have reconstruction surgery...this doc did the best work.... he is personable, kind and willing to work with you. I was referred to him by another Phoenix \"TOP DOC\" and he also praises his work.... thank you DR. Mosharrafa, I am a happy client.
