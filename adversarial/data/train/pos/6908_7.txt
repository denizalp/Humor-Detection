Items Selected:\nCronut Bite\nDonut Holes\nStrawberry Old Fashioned\nPeanut Butter Filled\nApple Fritter\nBlueberry Fritter\nBlueberry Crumb Cake\nPumpkin Spice Cake\nGlazed Red Velvet\n\nVisiting Ace twice, in short order, back in early 2015 it was unsurprising to find the small spot on the corner of Fort Apache and Tropicana still turning out Las Vegas' best Donuts this past Saturday, the same two smiling Korean women greeting patrons while d√©cor has improved and the selection has diversified.\n\nStopping at Ace en route to the Strip, artwork and LCD Menus now hanging above a glass cases with a bevy of classics plus several racks containing more to satisfy demand it was after a brief exchange minimally complicated by language barriers that two boxes were procured and delivering one to a local Chef in order to show off the strength of their Fritters the other half of the order was saved all for myself, a pair of old favorites joined by five more.\n\nTreated to complimentary donut holes and cronut bites, both as good as can be found anywhere in town, the rewards for early arrival at Ace are reaped in the form of several warm options fresh from the fryer and using this to guide the tasting first bites of the Pumpkin Spice Cake showed a soft, greaseless base with rich notes of nutmeg beneath light glaze while the Red Velvet was a rich with cocoa despite the dainty texture of the bright red base.\n\nThrilled again by the fritters, crisp and glazed on the exterior with plenty of fruit within, bites of blueberry cake topped with buttery streusel put a new spin on the classic while the sour cream old fashioned wheel melted slowly on the tongue beneath a sugary strawberry shellack.\n\nA veritable bargain at $20.62 for fifteen great pieces of fried dough it was last but not least that the lone  yeasted option was investigated, the wispiness of the crumb doing an admirable job of maintaining its texture despite a substantial amount of creamy peanut butter piped into the core.\n\nFIVE STARS:  The best donut shop in Las Vegas only a few weeks after opening it seems as though Ace has only gotten better over the course of it's first year and whether one is craving a classic or something a bit more innovative it would be hard to name any place executing some many different varieties with such across-the-board consistency...and certainly not at such a price.\n\nRECOMMENDED:  Fritters, Cronuts, Old Fashioned, Blueberry Crumb Cake.
