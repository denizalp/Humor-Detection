Last stop for the day. I love that you have a 4, 5 or 6 flight option here. Of course I went with the 6 flight option! This flight included: MOHK, Obsidian Lager, Grim Creeper, Lemon Haze Pale Ale, Porter and Lucille Red Ale. Boyfriend and I really enjoyed the MOHK, a hazelnut stout, and Porter. My personal favorite out of the beers that we tried was the Grim Creeper but since it was so high in alcohol I went with a pint of the runner-up Lucille Red Ale. \n\nThe atmosphere was inviting, people were so friendly minus one overserved gentleman who told me he needed to go wiz then laughed about it and said I did not need to know that.. why yes, you are correct. I also really liked the fireplace and outdoor seating area.
