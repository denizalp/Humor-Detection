We made a mistake. I'll start with that. We bought tickets... we had time difference issues... and we were about an hour late to our show. My bad.\n\nIt was intermission and the employees and Club Soda were like, \"Well, you can try to find a seat.\"\n\nA quick survey of the venue showed a full house. Even the seats around the bar were taken. I mean, there might have been a random seat here or there but it was hard to tell. As I said, it was intermission and folks were up going to the water closet and getting drinks.\n\nI walked around a little - up in the balcony and down on the floor. I asked about empty seats and was told that they were taken.\n\nIt was a nice venue. A nice stage. It seemed as if every seat was a good one. There were two nicely stocked bars.\n\nSo what's the issue?\n\nWell. We come from a land (Chicago) where we are known for comedy venues. Heck, we can easily walk to Zanies and Second City - two hallmarks. If we paid for tickets and came in late, the ushers would direct us to open seats. Not necessarily together or anything and probably really sucky views. But they would poke around with little flashlights and find us seats. After all - we paid for seats and seats we would get.\n\nWe paid for seats at Club Soda and nobody lifted a damn finger to get us seats. They were like, \"You're on your own. Good luck.\"\n\nThanks for nothing Club Soda.
