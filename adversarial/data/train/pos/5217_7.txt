So, I'd love to really say something positive about the Cleveland Amtrak Station... but I'm gonna come up empty. \n\nWe arrived for our train to New York at about 4:30am for the typical 5:30ish eastbound departure. The train finally arrived at about 7am. During this time, the staff did nothing to advise us of the delay or provide an estimate on when the train would arrive until they had an update for the westbound train. Not customer service friendly.\n\nThe station itself is like walking back into the early 80s... brown and gray are the main color palette... the ugly lighting really enhances your experience as you sit for hours waiting on your train until the sun comes up. The stains on the carpet really accentuate the entire atmosphere of government-run dreariness.\n\nThe vending machines do not accept cards... but there is a handy change machine nearby incase you actually carry cash and love pockets full of quarters.\n\nI didn't venture into the restroom but was told that I pretty much should be grateful.\n\nIf Amtrak, who has record-breaking ridership this year, were to just put some money into livening this station up, it could really enhance the overall experience of waiting 3-4 hours for your train to pull in.\n\nOutside, the parking is a bit of a mess. The lot could use a resurfacing and some lines. Spaces are limited, so arrive well before your train if you want to be able to park in the lot. The good news is it's free.
