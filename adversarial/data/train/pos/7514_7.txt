I thought the place was charming and I liked the hometown feel.  Neat story about how this is a family business and there was a contest for the new name of the restaurant.  Would be nice to know more about exactly what that contest was.  Was it Harlow the 1965 movie?  Not sure.  \n\nThe food was great, the service was great. The coffee was not so great, minus one star.  \n\nStill, all was enjoyable.  I will go back, but might bring my own coffee.
