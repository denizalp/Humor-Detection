Delicious food, great service, and reasonable prices. The food is authentic Mexican and leans on the spicy side - everything we ate was delicious. We ordered the Chorizo Dip as an appetizer. It is served was deep fried flour tortilla chips and topped with cheese and cilantro. It is perfection - spicy, tasty and cheesy. I also had a bowl of posole - I opted for red chili with pork and it was very good. They have a cute patio that I can't wait to try when it cools off
