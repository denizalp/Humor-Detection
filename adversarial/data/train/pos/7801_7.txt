I very rarely go to the big Grocery stores anymore. However, I had a lot of running to do today so , I need a few vegetables and I did not want to run all around looking for different items.\nSo here I came as I was in the neighborhood. Lots of parking that is for sure. Friendly staff. Lots of fruit and vegetables as well as every type of food that you could want or imagine. \nThe biggest fun I got today though was all the dishes and glasses and the Easter plates. There were all types. Egg cups and bowls , rabbit dishes that had plates. \nJust everything. Needless to say I purchased a bit.\nThey absolutely have anything you could want or need here.\nWith my fry's card I saved quite a bit of $$$ as well!\nI had a few things to do at customer service. The lady that helped me was ever so nice. It was all and all a great shopping experience.\nPlus, there were some girl scouts outside with a tent (cover) set up selling cookies. Oh course I bought a few boxes. You can put them in the freezer.
