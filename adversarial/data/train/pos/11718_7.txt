Second standalone McCafé in Toronto, and this one has more seating! Outfitted with plenty of wall plugs and phone charging stations, this is a great place to grab a bite to eat while getting some work done. You won't be able to order any of the classic McDonalds burgers here, but there is all-day breakfast (no hash browns though, sorry) and a bunch of cool new menu items.\n\nI decided to try the apple, brie, & honey croissant and the affogato (cookie crumbs & vanilla soft serve w\/ a shot of espresso). I was impressed with both items; everything in the croissant tasted super fresh and the affogato was honestly the best ice cream I've ever had from McDonalds - don't know if it was just me but I thought it actually tasted creamier.\n\nSince this is more of a café as opposed to a fast food joint, the overall environment\/cleanliness is also a marked improvement over that of regular McDonalds locations. McDonalds, you did well.
