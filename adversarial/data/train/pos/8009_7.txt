This place is in park road shopping center. You can get a good parking space since there are several available. The staff are friendly and welcoming. The drinks here need some work. In coming here I stuck to the shots or basics that you know. If you steer away from known territory you will get your feelings and pockets hurt for wasting money. The baja taco has flavor and the chicken taco needs seasoning. Whether you have the nacho app ( I recommend) or the tacos it's good portions. The decor is fun vibrant and lively. They don't have regular events but they could look into that to liven the place up. Happy eating.
