I ordered this for dinner tonight to my new home (which is a five star apartment, post script), and it was all pretty gross and overpriced. \n\nI ordered a large buffalo chicken and blue cheese poutine. How can you go wrong with that?! I think the issue is the blue cheese was a dressing and not actual blue cheese, so it sort of soured the gravy. Did I eat it all? Yes. Will I get it again? Never. \n\nNext time I'll go for their namesake and order the company. I'll let you know how that goes! \n\nPEPPER'S PISSED: They forgot cutlery which I specifically asked for and I have yet to unpack my kitchen box. This was a messy meal, folks. Messy, messy meal.
