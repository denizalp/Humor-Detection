I fail to see the attraction in this establishment.\n\nOn the weekends it is stuffed to overflowing (fire regs anyone?) the 'music' is obnoxiously loud, drink prices outrageous, and if you want to rub shoulders with beautiful people, posers, bikers, ed hardy wearers, packs of men on the hunt, prissy girls, and have to yell in their ears to hear each other, go right ahead.\n\nSame old fizzy tasteless lemonade type beer yet again.\nAfter a certain time of night, when it's at capacity, many patrons seem willing to queue for unreasonable periods to only get to the front, to be sized up by some low browed gorrilla of a bouncer, who undemocratically makes the decision as to wether one gets in or not.\n\nOne has to admire the logic of the management of Melrose. Have the music loud enough, the place packed enough, and people have no choice but to gaze at the many uneccesary TVs, be sonically bashed into submission by the pounding 'music', and since it's of little use to try to talk to anyone without using a megaphone, (I'm not sure the bouncer would let you in with that) let alone try to squrim ones way through the fashion victim croud to talk to that interesting looking man\/woman, what else is there to do but drink?\n\nExactly. Less talking, more drinking = more profit for the management of melrose from the herd like masses.\n\nIf you have to go? Use the left side of the premises as far away from the writhing pheremone fest on the right as possible.\n\nOh, and take a pad and pencil to communicate with freinds, and some earplugs.
