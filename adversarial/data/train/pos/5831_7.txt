I went in there today to get a Geocaching trackable and walked in, one guy in there at the time with 2 customers.  Not a hello or any acknowledgement at all.  I stood there for 20 mins and he didn't even say a hello or I will be right with you or even look at me.  I am a big girl and was in red so really hard to miss.  Not to mention 2 people in the office right beside and they would look at me but they wouldn't talk to me either?\nI left.  I would not recommend this store to anyone, sadly they are one of limited stores in the city that sell Geocaching paraphernalia in the city but I will have to find somewhere else.
