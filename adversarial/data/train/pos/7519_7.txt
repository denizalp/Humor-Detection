This is a really neat place. I've only been for small plates but have eaten my face off. Yup. Maybe I shouldn't be bragging about that. \n\n\"Grazes. Watch your valuables tho.\"\n\"Will leave no blade of grass unturned.\"\n\"Has the mouth of a Hoover.\"\n\nEr - perhaps I should revise those warning labels. What I'm trying to convey is that the food here is gosh darn good. The service is always with a smile. And this place is super group friendly. This can be dangerous. Watch out! I mean, for your waist lines!\n\nI'm going to start with a SERVER SHOUT OUT.\n\nMy most recent adventure was under the tutelage of a bomb diggity server named William G. (#68). This kid was zip zagging seamlessly inside and out to help a number of large tables. I gotta tell you something - come closer - this kid is solid gold. Waiting on groups is not like taking attendance. (Unless that involves herding cats in the dark.) \n\nThere's a reason they ask for your party to be present in order to be seated. It's so taking orders is easier. Did we do that?\nNope.\n\nWere we consistent in our ordering pace all night?\nNope.\n\nDid we have a lot of questions?\nUh huh.\n\nDid he ever break his smile?\nNope.\n\nDid he have time for me to point out a $0.50 HH hour difference on the menu for a draft beer? Um, NO. The kid was still smiling and super pleasant to boot. Gold! (Probably hates me.)\n\nHAPPY HOUR\nDood. They have four beers on tap, generally on the lighter side. (Note: Currently stocking a Koko Brown which is dark, \"coconut inspired\" which I am a fan of.) $3.50 or $4, not sure. Whatever the price it's a good deal before 6pm.\n\nLate to HH? Can't be here by 6pm? \nFollow them on Twitter for their \"Word of the Day\". You'll want it for super special pricing on drinks. (I heard you can also receive it via email.)\n\nFOOD\nHoly Smoke! There are very rich foods (watch those waist lines) and delightfully healthy, small portion options. HOH so good! My photos have some of my favorites. Right now what I would give for a HH tofu or pork taco.  (Yeah, I went out last night. Need some replenishing.) $3 provides a taco that can be served into *two* portions. That rules! And it fits with my balanced approach to not exercising. \n\nHey! I'll get back to the gym. \nSomeday.\nRight.\n\nUntil then, I'll come drink and be merry. Here.\n\nAnd, apparently at the new location that is opening in Scottsdale.\n\nTOO MANY CHOICES!
