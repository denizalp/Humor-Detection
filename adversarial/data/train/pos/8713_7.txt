I've been hearing about this Tiki bar from word of mouth and I finally decided to check it out last night. For a small place, it was popping! There was a live band with a cool crowd.  I felt the drinks were kinda pricey but after tasting them, it was worth it. They are made by hand and from scratch. I highly recommend the dark and stormy. It comes on fire! \nAs for our server, she was exceptionally nice and fun (and of course beautiful). Her name was Jessica and her smile was contagious. She was very attentive and took lots of pictures for our party. Her genuine spirit alone made me wanna give a good tip! Service was excellent from the waitress to the bartenders. I didn't catch the bartenders name but he was a light-skinned black guy with a very fun personality as well. \nNot into tiki drinks? Well, this is still a place to check out. There is a mini pirate room with an actual ship and a skeleton that talks! It is uniquely decorated with a huge clam to take pictures in. A fun place that is like no other. Definitely far from your typical chains, i.e. PTs. \n\nMy only complaint... I wish they served food. However, our waitress did let us know that we were allowed to bring food into the facility and she even brought menus from surrounding businesses. \n\nA+ Golden Tiki !
