We love coming to Rajbhog for chaat, chai, and last minute brown people groceries. There is a decent amount of Indian grocery items for sale, some priced well and others are not. Be careful when picking up juice or soda from the cooler, I have found them to be expired sometimes. I am not fond of the $10 card minimum... Makes me pick up yummy but unnecessary items. It can be crowded during afternoon tea and dinner time. Love the chai, very spicy and not overly sweet. I also like getting the samosa chaat and ragda pattice chaat (there's a hint of sweetness in the ragda pattice). Chaat is kinda pricey ($7-8) when you are dining in considering the small portion size. I recommend taking out, there's a significant difference in the size. Be sure to eat it quick, it gets soggy. \n\nI've still been meaning to try the thali and lunch specials, looks like a lot of food for the price. Cheers!
