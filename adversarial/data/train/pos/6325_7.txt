New boutique clothing store in the Annex. Very similar to the \"Risque\" boutique a few doors down. I'm just happy to see more clothing stores opening in the Annex, we certainly were not in need of another sushi joint.\n\nSkirt had a large selection of jewelry that was unique and very reasonably priced. A lot of it looked handmade, but I could be wrong.\n\nBesides jewelry, they had a decent selection of women's clothing. Lots of floral prints, trendy dresses and girly skirts. \n\nThe interior was revamped quite nicely and they have proper change rooms in the back. \n\nI'm not 100% sure but I think they are located in the old \"Secrets from your Sister\" shop that moved further west on Bloor last year.
