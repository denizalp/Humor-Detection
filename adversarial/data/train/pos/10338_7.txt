Although my review will get lost in this sea of (honest) high ratings, I felt the need to tell you that if I were to summarize in one word how I feel about this place, it would be the word, \"YES\"...absolutely Y-E-S, YES.\n\nLittle Miss BBQ is the only BBQ restaurant, so far, in Arizona that leaves me feeling \"FULLY SATISFIED\".  At other (praised) establishments, my stomach can't seem to take some of the BBQ, the sauces, the seasoning or just everything altogether; it always leaves me feeling a little nauseated for some odd reason, which is why I never used to crave BBQ much.  Don't get me wrong, they're good but my stomach doesn't like it...maybe it's the way it's smoked?  On the other hand, when I eat Little Miss BBQ, my stomach screams \"YES!\"  Seriously.  It's the only place that my stomach seems to like and has me craving for it quite often.  Their meats are very tender, juicy, and well-seasoned.  Their sauces come separately and are just as good, but you know it's great BBQ when you can eat it without the sauce...  When I think BBQ in AZ, I think Little Miss.  Everything I have tried, you HAVE to try...\n\n* Fatty Brisket = YES\n* Sausage = YES\n* Pulled Pork = YES\n* The Jefe = YES\n* Jalapeno Cheddar Grits = YES (Mind you, I hated grits until I tried this one!  I guess it just takes the right kind of grits to make me a believer, and it's a shame to say that I have even tried homemade--not-so-great--grits in both Tennessee and Arkansas.)\n* Homemade Pecan Pie = YES\n\nYou can bet that my boyfriend and I are going back to try everything else--hook, line, and sinker!\n\nPlus, the place is locally owned and the owners and staff are always very friendly.  They also give you a sample of their (popular item) fatty brisket OR the sausage as you walk through the doors of heaven--err, Little Miss BBQ.  Keep in mind, though, that the menu is subject to change as they run out of items very quickly - they make a certain amount for that day and when it's gone, it's gone.\n\nI have been there waiting for about 15 minutes during the week in the late morning; and I have been there waiting for about 30-40 minutes at most, during labor day weekend, at the peak of lunchtime - I will go and stay regardless of a long wait.\n\nSo if you're wondering if this place is worthwhile, I say \"YES\", but I'll let you be the judge of it... Hope you enjoy it as much as we did!
