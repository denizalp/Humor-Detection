Since they've created fresh biz profiles under 3 name variations, I'll post my original review in them, as well.   http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz\/biddulph-arrowhead-peoria#hrid:HjRi5Zq1Nj2rP9PTqe9VSg\n\n*******************************************\nQ~\nWhat kind of experience begins with what a customer thought was one of the best new car buying experiences they've yet had, \nquickly sours and turns into a HORRENDOUS display of 'customer service' devoid of all rational logic when the dealership is called out on their attempts to swindle customers in a scandalous RIP-OFFof a 'tire warranty\/un-needed overpriced service' scheme, \nrancifies to a disgusting attempt to belittle and humiliate a customer and blame the customer for not being able to understand the terms of the warranty contract (which was understood completely, just understood by an intelligent customer to be an attempt to rip off those not willing to do the math and see what a scam it is), \ncausing the customer to spend 2 hours in a parking lot of a nearby Target with a poster board and markers creating a PROTEST SIGN to stand on busy Bell Rd on a Saturday and try to let as many people as possible know about the SHEISTERS at Biddulph Mazda and the NASTY EXPERIENCE with their sales, service, and management,\ncausing dealership to attempt (*unsuccessfully*) to stop the customer's protest by CALLING THE COPS ON THE CUSTOMER,  \nand the cops, after interviewing many parties, including other customers on the lot who interacted with the protestor by asking questions about what the backstory was, etc, did not, in fact, tell the protestor to stop, but simply left instructions about proper protest technique with which the protestor was already familiar and was already following \n??????????????????\nA~\nan experience with Biddulph Mazda, that's what kind.
