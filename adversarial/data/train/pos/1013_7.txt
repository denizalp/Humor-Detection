my friend from vegas took me here. i'm sure people don't come here for the liquor cause i can get cheaper PBR in LA but the entertainment is priceless. there was a live punk band the night we went and this one guy in the mosh pit kept running into tables and the one fat chick tried to hop into the mosh pit too and ended up getting punched in the face. it was an awesome time.
