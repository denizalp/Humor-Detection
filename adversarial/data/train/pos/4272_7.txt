In my current knocked up state, it was hard to visit an alcohol making facility of any kind, but luckily liquor is low on my alcohols I like to drink list. My partner though? He loves him some whiskey, so off we went. \n\nWe sat at the bar and ordered a flight for him (and later a whiskey sour) and a couple of non-alcoholic drinks for me (the non-alcoholic Honey Cap and the Horchata) I must say, even though I wasn't able to drink any of the liquor, I was able to smell them like a creep and approve of one or two just based on scent alone. My man thought a few were pretty good based on both smell AND taste too, which is obviously a better measure. I'm pretty sure he was impressed by the whiskey, which is hard to do, and he also liked the honey liqueur too. Sorry I can't give my unsolicited opinion on these...I'll get on it in May when I'm womb-passenger free. In alcohol free news though, the mixed drinks they serve here are legit. Both with or without the booze. They use fresh local ingredients in everything and take their time to make sure they are perfectly mixed. Read the menu and watch them work for a couple of minutes and you'll see. If you're knocking them down, you might not approve though, as it takes time for perfection and fresh stuff costs a lot. Point is, drink slow and have patience. It'll be worth it in the end. Or pre\/post drink. Either way.\n\nNext time I'm in Madison, I'll definitely be stopping in. Especially to try the drinks WITH alcohol this time around.
