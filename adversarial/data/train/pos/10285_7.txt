After seeing the Ramsay show, I felt I had to come and meet Samy and Amy. I must say that I had a great time there! Samy welcomed me so lovely, he made me an eslresso which was one of the best I had in a while, and I am very sophisticated about my coffee. Samy made sure to bring  ice cold water a side which is the thing to do. They were so nice, we took a picture together and they didn't want to take money... I will definitelly come back to visit and eat, this time I was just not far away from lunch. Leave the reality shows alone and go have some good time with them - they are truly a humble hard working couple
