I was extremely excited to eat at this restaurant after hearing all the owners crazy commercials on the radio. \n\nI was disappointed by the food and service and especially the owner. \n\nThe owner is the rude and disrespectful to the patrons of his business. We went in before the dinner rush around 4:00 pm. It was myself, my wife, my 8 yr old son, and my 1yr old. The owner decided to have a conversation as loud as can be about how he does not agree with interracial relationships and even more so doesn't agree with interracial children. I am of Mexican\/American and my wife is Irish\/american. My 8 yr old was completely upset because the owner went one to say,\" these kids are going to grow up thinking to themselves who am I? why don't I look like my mom or my dad?\" I was infuriated and my wife was fuming mad. \n\nI don't care what you religious or political views are but you have a responsibility as a owner of an establishment to be respectful of your patrons who are spending money to support your business. I shouldn't have to explain to my 8 yr old why this old man is spewing hate and that we have to pay for it. \n\nOnce he finishes his rant we asked for the check and I had my wife put my kids in the car. I asked for the owner and we had a heated conversation. Which he offered no explanation or apology. \n\nI will never in my lifetime eat or recommend anyone in town to this establishment and  I work in the hospitality industry and will do my best to not recommend this place to anyone. \n\nMy 8 yr old said it the best when were in the car \"We should have went to Olive Garden.\"
