I have been watching Giada on Food Network ever since I was a young teenager (over a decade now!).  I love her show, recipes, and products.  Basically, I'm a HUGE Giada fan.  When I arrived in Las Vegas for work, I knew that I had to try out Giada's restaurant.  I had huge expectations and was preparing myself to be WOWed.\n\nGiada is located in the Cromwell, right when you go up the escalator.  It's a beautiful restaurant with lots of fanciness.  I had The Giada cocktail and a porchetta and spinach mini pizza.  The cocktail was delicious and the mini pizza was tasty, but nothing too out of the ordinary.  \n\nI originally was planning to order something more, but the service here is just annoying.  I only got a light snack because I don't like eating full on meals at bars.  I asked the hostess if I could get a table, but she said that since I was alone, I HAD to sit at the bar.  She was a huge grump and no smile or welcome at all.  If she had said something along the lines of they can't give me a table due to not having a reservation, fine.  But she literally said, \"Since you're alone, you can ONLY sit at the bar.\"  Really?  That's odd to me.   The bartender was fine, but not friendly at all.  The atmosphere here is way too pretentious.  The hostess left a very sour taste in my mouth before I even was seated.  \n\nDespite my admiration of Giada, would I come back?  Nope.  There are far too many delicious places with excellent service on the Strip, so why deal with young snooty pretentious girls?
