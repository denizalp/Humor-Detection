THIS IS A SCAM! I wish I could give zero stars to these criminals. They pose as a legitimate business but they are not. \n\nAfter providing false information about the way they operate and what the costs will be they ask for your credit card information for your file wherein they proceed to charge you despite promising not to. After calling to sort it out they claim that I agreed to these costs and that they would not be refunding any of my money. \n\nWe had to cancel our credit card and we have since reported them to our bank. \n\nStay away from these crooks!
