Haven't even moved in yet and already we are in love. My partner and I are on a waiting list for a 9\/14 move in for the floor plan we desire. Met with Yamilet just over a week ago,and after that initial meeting\/tour we decided we didn't need to look at any other apartments and that this was indeed the place for us. That night I completed the application and lease online ( which I reccomend everyone doing because of the move in credit you receive),and just 2 days later (that's how fast it was) everything was processed and we got the green light. Yamilet in the office is a total ball of sunshine and so very friendly. The tour and floor plans impressed us,as did the amazing decor in the demo units. The clubhouse is spectacular as is the pool area ( I do feel it still could use more greenery and possibly umbrellas). Needless to say we are looking forward to moving in soon.
