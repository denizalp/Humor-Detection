The former Hilton is hands down the best place to watch games, especially on Sundays for Football Central. They have a whole theater showing the games in addition to the sports book, the most reliable spreads for betting, and the cheapest beer (priorities) ;) It's the next best thing to actually being at the game (even better actually cause the beers are cheaper!) Especially when my team wins...Go Panthers ;)
