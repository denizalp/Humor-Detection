I was extra hungry from spending nearly all day at the pool. I thoroughly disappointed by the steakhouse at Camelot in many ways.\n\nTrying to celebrate my mother's birthday, we had a party of five so the wait was lengthy. We were sat next to the kitchen door on a foldout round table. Not complaining just informing. \n\nMy disappointment came from mostly from the food. The service was a little lackluster for the price but passable. I ordered a medium ribeye. I received a medium-well charred shoe. To the chef's credit, there was about two bites that were pink and could classify as medium but did not taste any different than the rest of the flavorless chunk of meat. I have not had a steak that bad since my last trip to sizzler. My sister ordered a medium well New York strip, which explains the charring of my steak, it too was subpar. Lack of seasoning and low quality meat are my guess. At $35+ without sides they really need to step up there game.\n\nWe have eaten here in the past with no complaints but we will not be back.
