First time trying this place.  I wanted to rate it a 3.5, just because I want to explore other menu items before raising the rating, but eff it, it was delicious.\n\nI opted out of going to a ballgame with my man for the night, so I decided to stay home, order pizza, do homework, and watch movies. I wanted to try out someplace new by my house, so I explored the Yelp community and their reviews, and stumbled across this place.\n\nI called in my order.  The man who answered was friendly when taking my order.  I had bad reception in my apartment, but he seemed patient throughout the ordering process.  I decided to go with the special, XL or L pizza with 20 wings for around 20 bucks.  Not bad, ey?  I got my regular toppings, ham on all, half pep, half pinapple.  Mild wings.  \n\nApproximately 30 minutes later the food arrived at the door.  A faint little knock almost unheard to an old person presented itself for me to answer.  HOLY CRAP, I thought when I saw the food.  The pizza box was SO damn big!  When I brought the food inside, I was still irked.  The slices were huge.  The pizza was hot and fresh.  Melted cheese.  Not a lot of grease.  I asked for extra sauce, and I got it.\n\nThis is the kind of pizza that is meant to be folded in half.  Do not try and eat it otherwise, it just won't work. The wings were flavorful and large as well.  These are not sissy sized wings.\n\nOverall, high quality pizza and wings.  I really want to try this place fresh from the restaurant.  I think it may earn an additional star.  Nothing is better than fresh of the plate, but delivery was acceptable for my current situation (which apparently is free!).
