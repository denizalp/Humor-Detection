I've lived in this neighborhood for 8+ years, and have driven by countless times. Finally, after a bout with an illness, and in an effort to get my immune system back on track, I decided to stop in and see what they had to offer.\n\n1) I had no idea this place was so big!\n2) I feel ashamed that I hadn't been in before!\n3) Staff is super helpful and knowledgeable. I spent time talking with the naturopathic nutritionist who gave many more recommendations on diet and nutrition and pointed me in the direction of affordable supplements. \n4) They offer free work shops and seminars every Sat. \n5) Super competitive pricing\n6) Healthy Habit is a locally owned and operated store (why was I wasting my money at the Vitamin Shoppe again?) \n\nIt is a very crowded store, but they have so much to offer!
