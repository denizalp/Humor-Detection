The hummus was served with freshly baked bread and tasted very authentic. However, one of our entr√©es was not very easy on the stomach. My boyfriend ordered the Doner Gyro platter, he stated it \"tasted like dog food.\" He proceeded to continue to try and palette it, but every piece of meat tasted the same. I had to try it to make sure he was not imagining things, and I had to agree with him. I could not continue to eat my meal once I tasted his.
