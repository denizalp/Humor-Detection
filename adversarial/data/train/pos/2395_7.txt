It's a greasy spoon that I've been going to since I was a small child.  Some of the same servers are still working there and I love them, they are on top of their game.  I usually order the skillet with green chile and flour tortillas, absolutely delicious.  It's old and the booths are torn up but I don't care, I love it!
