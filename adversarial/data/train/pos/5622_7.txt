Had I not gotten a locals discount, this would totally be a 4 star review. If you follow me, you know I am HUGE on local love and appreciation! So thank you, High Roller for jumping along board! Only 40 bucks for myself, my bf, and the daughter since luckily she's still 12! \nI did not expect much. I was raised in this city, what can this wheel show me that I have not yet seen? \nWell, a view I did not know existed for one. A shot of the Bellagio fountain show that puts a whole new aspect on it. And to be able to fully see the entire city from east to west, north to south, was simply breathtaking. \nTIPS:\n1. Go with a larger crowd, so you have the chance of getting the pod to yourself, or you and another group ONLY. It fits 30, but I would say only 18-20 comfortably. \n2. When you step into the pod, go for the seats on the right. They have a better view IMO. \n3. Take advantage of the restroom and bar before going up. It is a 30 minute ride. \n4. Be respectful. If you have bratty kids who throw fits, stay at home. If you might be too drunk, don't do it. And BY ALL MEANS, if you are afraid of heights, SHUT UP and deal with it, or stay on the ground. We don't all want to try to convince you to walk to the window and look down, really. \n\nOther than that, enjoy! There are not many places you can go in this city, and enjoy the scenery. Especially from the strip!
