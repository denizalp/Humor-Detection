Hells.... I would never have thought I would find myself at a place or club I HATE that much and made me feel THAT uncomftable! The security there SUCKS major BUTT. They are SO unfriendly SO rude its simply redicilous! I have been to a lot of high end clubs as well as dive bars, I have hired and fired security personal, but THIS place is the end of a poop turd in security fo sho! They are rediculously rude. I got shoved out of they, hard! I got my arm pinched by some fat dude working there and I was told I am being escorted out because I had my boot off and litterally was unable to put it back on (due to the crowd being asked to float in the air since you are NOWHERE allowed to stand!) WTF!! I have been to really high end invitation only clubs in London and NY, THIS place is worse than a fat finger in my butt... I rather have my butt hair plugged individually than go THERE again EVER! \nTHe sad thing is really, it has all the potential to be a fabulous club! Its awesome setting, the dancers are just great! THe DJ is fantastic, the promoters really nice and the bartenders smile. \nBUT due to the rudness of these oger Security people, i will NEVER go back there again nor will I send any of my groups there. \n\nPeople DO NOT GO THERE until they change their attititude!!
