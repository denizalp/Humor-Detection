Okay, I definitely give this place 5 stars for food quality. A little pricey, but delicious. HOWEVER, while i totally love outside seating and watching the kitchen, I will admit that I saw less than appetizing practices. If you are going to let your customers watch you prepare food, please please please make sure your hygiene is on point. I observed chefs eating without washing their hands and going back to touching food. An employee run his fingers through his hair and then delicately place garnish on some taco. A patron sneeze directly toward their ingredients stored in open containers. If a salad bar has a sneeze guard, outside seating should also. And I get it, you're working and wanna listen to music. But if I'm paying $50 for a single meal, please don't make me listen to 50 cent and Eminem songs saying nigga and faggot? Come on guys. If your patrons can here this, you might want to up the classiness. I sat outside for the ambience and experience though. Definitely got that :)
