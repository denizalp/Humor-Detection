Poor customer service\n\nMy friends and I have been looking for a great place to make it our spot. We have been to many places and we found this place, first time I got into it with a nail tech after politely telling them four times how I wanted the design and also showing her a photo. \nSecond time was nice and they do a nice job so I made an appointment for me and two of my friends at five pm. My friends arrived before me and were told that we didnt have an appointment,  my friend called me and told me,  I told her who I spoke with and my friend again told the nail tech we had an appointment.  The tech said \" like I told you, you'll have to wait,  we didn't write it down\". Needless to say after now two issues we did not wait and we will not go back!  \nThey do great nails if you can handle the attitude
