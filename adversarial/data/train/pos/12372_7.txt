Came to this location twice in a 3 day Vegas bender. By bender I really mean a nice quiet stay on the strip, with my husband, to escape the Minnesota cold. We pick a different hotel every year. This time we stayed at Vdara Hotel and Spa, a quick monorail ride and some escalators later we found ourselves at Monte Carlo, home of 800 Degrees. Where the magic happens. \n\nWhen I think of my favorite pizza, I think of Punch Neapolitan Pizza in Minneapolis. Well let's just say, as I was eating, I feared that I had to move Punch down to the Number 2 spot. 800 Degrees has every single aspect of the perfect pizza, for me. Fresh ingredients that you can see and choose from, cooked in an alarmingly hot fire for about 2 minutes until it's done, put on a plate, sliced in front of you and handed over with a smile from one of the nice staff members. Quick, efficient, cheesy, and a fire burnt crust. \n\nThe fact of the matter is my Margherita with pepperoni and gorgonzola was so damn good on our first visit that it made me come back on our last day for another pizza. This time I got the Margherita with feta cheese, kalamata olives and pepperoni. For some completely strange reason, I couldn't finish it, which almost never happens. I swear. The first pizza I almost inhaled and nearly got started on the plate. I attribute that to a long flight, and nothing to eat for 8 hours, a raging cold and sore throat, made me one cranky ravenous traveler. So on the last visit, I got a box to go, and had it for a late night snack high up in my Corner Suite on the 51st floor, where it had been resting in the fridge and waiting for the microwave. Yes, the Vdara is that awesome - all the rooms come with a full kitchen. \n\nMaybe next time we should stay at the Monte Carlo so I can be close to my pizza. I am infatuated with that damn pizza. But I still love you, Punch!
