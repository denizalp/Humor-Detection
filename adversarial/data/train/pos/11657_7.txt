Southwest service at Sky Harbor is really, really starting to slip.\n\nOn the past 6 occasions that I've had the misfortune of flying SouthWest from PHX, I have been on average 45 minutes delayed. The worst of which was last Thursday when I was delayed over two hours. \n\nSouthwest, your hub is in Phoenix. When one of your planes is on the fritz, just bring in one of the several you stash here. My time is money, and when you're late, I am losing money. Or in the instance of last week, I am losing vacation time, which to me is even more valuable as I don't get much of it.\n\nThe consistent inconsistency is one thing, but when its married to the people who I now habitually encounter on your flights, its getting to be too damn much of a pain in my ass to fly your \"discount airline.\"\n\nLast week is a pretty good example. Mind you, Southwest can't control who purchases seats on their flights, but the flight attendants, who seem to be so overtly fond of banning people for dress or political commentary, really don't do jack shit in the air.\n\nThere was a child and his mother behind me on the flight. Little bastard wouldn't calm down, wouldn't stop screaming about \"Oh, I can see grandpa's house\" from 35,000' in the air, wouldn't stop kicking the seat. All his useless womb of a mother could do was \"Oh jeffy, calm down, give mommy a kiss.\" Mind you, if I had been wearing one of my objectionable t-shirts they wouldn't have let me on the plane, but even after SEVERAL passenger complaints to the lady and to the flight attendant the attendants absolutely refused to do anything or to speak to the mother.\n\nThree hours of that shit is just too much, sorry.\n\nSouthwest really has become the \"Greyhound of the Sky\" in the last year or so. I have one more flight booked with them this year so far, and if I have a hand in my travel, it will be the last time I fly on this two bit trash festival in the stratosphere.
