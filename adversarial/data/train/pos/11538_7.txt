Ah, the 90s. Pre-locavore. Every epicurean item from every corner of the globe, available for purchase and consumption without regard for seasons, distances, expense, or appearing PC. Dean and Deluca rocks that decade with panache, and not even an inkling of shame. Awesome.\n\nNevermind that the cheeses have no prices posted. Nevermind that things here (vinegar, certain brands of truffle oil, falafel chips, bouillion) are twice as much as they are at neighboring and (shockingly) more affordable Earth Fare, even. Prices carefully tucked under the bottom of jars, bags, boxes, as if displaying them prominently would be garish or uncouth - this is not a bargain hunter's place to shop. Small, selective section of kitchen implements - not meant to be of use in dire need, but trends - microplanes and zesters, mezzalunas. Spotless shelves in perfect order. Truffled products of every imaginable use - nori salt - the olive bar might be the only thing here leaning towards pedestrian. Chico-and-Nordstrom's-clad ladies abound. Service can be icy, but always well informed. Is the coffee superlative? Not at all, but it's not obscenely priced either.\n\nA quick note on the cheese counter - large and global, and the few times I've bought a hunk, it had obviously been well cared for, but EF's, down the street, is larger and more locally focused. Go there instead.\n\nWould I shop here regularly? If I made so much money that a 50 percent mark up on standard exotics didn't ruffle my feathers, maybe. It's clean, classy, well staffed, culinarily inspiring. Do I come here now? For a very short list of things sold here and no where else in Charlotte, I do. But wise shoppers know where to buy those falafel chips and truffle oils for half the price. For the most part, I'll be with them.
