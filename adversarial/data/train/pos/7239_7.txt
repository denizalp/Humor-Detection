It was time to bid adieu to our circa 1980's pool with the flaking plaster and the lion's heads spewing water. Upon the recommendation of our regular pool guy, and after obtaining several bids, we decided on Aquavida to perform a complete pool remodel.\n\nNick, the Aquavida salesman, had a really good vision of what we wanted to achieve and offered up some very good suggestions. He also worked with me to quickly and economically locate the copper scuppers we needed for our stone feature wall. \n\nDelays because of some miscommunications, the draining crew's inability to locate the clean-out, some out of stock tile, the Christmas holidays and some broken equipment took the job about twice as long as was initially promised, but the end result despite the delays is magnificent . The mini pebble pool surface, the waterline tile, the feature wall and the decking look terrific and met our expectations.\n\nWe will now have a problem getting people to leave our backyard when we want them to!
