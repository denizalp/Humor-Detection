The last Vegas trip I took with my boyfriend was more fine dining oriented than getting sloshed and stupid in sin city. We scored a deal with all the Mandalay Bay restaurants on restaurant.com and decided to come to StripSteak on our first night. We arrived in the middle of happy hour and hence opted to sit at the bar and ordered a couple of appetizers and cocktails at reduced cost. \n\nThe bar staff was super friendly and entertaining so we decided to keep our behinds on those stools for the entrees. A delicious steak and an amazing half organic grilled chicken with truffle mac and cheese later, we happily strolled our stuffed bellies out of StripSteak. \n\nI will definitely come back here for some more happy hour. Solid clean food, great service, good cocktail and wine list...that's all I need to be happy!
