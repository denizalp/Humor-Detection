I'd like to preface this review with some background information.  I am not a big breakfast restaurant person, I prefer to eat the morning meal in the comfort of my own home.  I am also a late riser - often times waking up well after 11 or 12.  Put the two together and one would say, why even go to a breakfast joint?\n\nWell, the simple answer is, as many others have discovered: there is a special something about going out for breakfast.  There is something fun about not just crawling out of bed, stumbling into the kitchen and breaking some eggs.  Going out for breakfast is different and that is why I like to do it on occasion.\n\nAnyways, Dundas Street Grill is the best breakfast place I have been to in Etobicoke, granted I only know of two others.  If you come on weekends then there will be a lineup, especially if you come after 10.  The lineup can sometimes grow as large as out of the restaurant, so unless you are ok with waiting outside, make sure you arrive BEFORE 10.  On weekdays I have found it to be a relatively short line, if any at all.\n\nThe service in the place is good and the menu options aren't too expensive.  The menu is pretty standard, consisting of mostly egg-based dishes.  There are a few other types for people like myself who do not really eat eggs.  French toast and pancakes are two such dishes that I would strongly recommend.  The portions are good and will fill you up, unless you are really really hungry.\n\nIf you are leaning more towards lunch, then they whip out their lunch menu sometime after 11.  I have only been there for lunch once and can't remember what I got but both my friend and I were satisfied.\n\nIn general, a pretty good place but nothing exceptional.  Perhaps if I didn't get up at 12 and actually ate eggs I would have given the place a better rating.
