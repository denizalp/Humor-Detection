The person helping me was decent, though he was good at bumping my total to $1400 (with the extended warranties and \"oh, you have to buy a new version of windows because it won't work with your old windows!\") I sighed and paid the man (wtf do I know?) and was promised it would be ready in 2 business days.  I left my old computer with them, after they said they could use the old case and save me some $$ there.\n\nI get a call from them about 5 days later telling me that they can't use the case because they need special mounting screws for the new motherboard.  (Apparently Canada Computers doesn't stock useful things such as these!), so I was stuck paying for a new case anyways.\n\n2-3 days later and I have to call THEM to find out if my computer is ready.  It's been ready for a while, but nobody bothered to call.  I picked up my new and old computer and, when I brought it home, found they hadn't bothered to return my old motherboard, RAM, or any of the other stuff that was still perfectly good and usable (if I were to do a cheap build for someone).  I had to drive BACK to get that, and only then find that they botched my HDD somehow, so all my files are pooched.\n\nAh well, I didn't want all of my photos and music anyways.  Yes, I should have made a backup, so I suppose I'm the one in the wrong here. You're absolved, Canada Computers. I'll switch this 1 star to 5 stars within 2 business days.
