I liked this place a lot. Clean, well-appointed room. Complimentary lemon water, coffee and cookies all day long. The WiFi was adequate. The breakfast buffet was awesome, and reasonably priced at about $11 per person. My made-to-order omelette was delicious, and my husband ate roughly a pound of bacon. \n\nSo why only 4 stars? The place could use some serious sound deadening. My neighbors stayed up most of the night, and we could easily hear their conversations.  They weren't talking overly loudly -- there was simply nothing separating their conversation from my ears.  Which isn't all that amusing at 4 in the morning.
