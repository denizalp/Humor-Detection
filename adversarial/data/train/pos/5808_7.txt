It was a tough choice between two and three stars, but I rounded up based simply on the fact that the food merited the extra.  \n\nI showed up with a party of four at around 7 on a Sunday night, and it was pretty crowded. Usually that's a good sign. We waited by the front door, but no one came out to greet us, so after 2-3 minutes, I walked into the counter area where they were sorting take out orders and asked to be seated. \n\nSomeone came by and offered menus and water. And then they were gone. Like for a while. Like long enough that I had to eventually flag someone down just to take our order. \n\nThey didn't have my standard dish I order at every Thai place on the planet, Pad Prik King, but they had something not too far off of it in the form of spicy green beans. One of the people in my party ordered a shrimp dish, one had a rice dish, and another ordered Panang curry. They brought out the rice dish first, and then we waited. And waited. For like another 5-6 minutes before they brought out the green bean dish and the Panang. And then we waited. And waited. \n\nWe asked twice about when the shrimp dish would be coming out, and were assured it was on its way, and was delayed because, according to the waiter, \"shrimp takes a long time to cook.\"  \n\nRight...\n\nAs the three of us were more or less finishing up our dishes, the shrimp dish finally arrived.  Luckily, it was good. So was everything else, to be honest.  The food isn't knock-your-socks-off fantastic, but it's good enough, and if it wasn't for the abysmal service, I'd probably consider eating here again.  Maybe I'll consider it as a viable take out option, where the staff doesn't have the same opportunity to ignore me.  \n\nBottom line:\n1. The place looks nice enough, although there are plenty of Thai places in the valley with far better ambiance and less of a \"fast food\" feel to them.  \n2. The Panang curry is pretty damn good.\n3. Apparently, the shrimp was good. I wish I could remember the name of the dish.\n5. C'mon, man!  No Pad Prik King???\n6. C'mon, man!  No beer or wine?\n\nCome for the food. Stay because you're still waiting for someone to take your order and\/or bring it to your table.
