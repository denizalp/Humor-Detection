We thought we would see this show since it was more on the 'adult' side than the other shows, and it was reasonably priced compared to the other Cirque shows in Vegas. (And, FYI if you do go to Vegas to see these shows, never buy your tickets online, you should buy them a few days before or the day of the show at Tix 4 Tonight, which is located at various hotels in Vegas and offers significant discounts on all the popular shows). Just had to throw out a quick plug... \n\nZumanity was a very tasteful, artistic and colorful show with lots of sexuality to go around. Although everyone was prancing around topless and half naked for most of the show, you almost forget that they are not wearing clothes because you are so focused on the incredible things that they are doing with their bodies. A few of the highlights for us were the two girls in the fishbowl who were doing this very intense routine in the water, and the fabio looking guy who does this strip tease and gets completely naked (but is surrounded by women so you don't see his pee-pee). It was just a fun show all around, and there was also a comedic relief type of duo that opened the show and would do silly skits in between the performances. I probably could have done without that and had more performances, but it was a nice touch and it was pretty entertaining. If you are thinking about sitting in the front few rows, just be aware that they do pull a few people up and embarrass you quite a bit, so either have a good sense of humor and sit up there, or buy the cheap seats and sit in the balcony!  All in all though, it was very impressive and left us wanting to come back to Las Vegas so that we can see all of the other Cirque shows too!
