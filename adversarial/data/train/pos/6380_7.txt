While most tourists love to go to Pho Kim Long and we locals love Pho So 1.  \n\nNumber 10 is my favorite.  Classic combo pho with all the good stuffs! Added extra meat will make me a very happy carnival.  \n\nService is great & speedy! \n\nGood food and huge parking lot.   \n\nBut let me warn u, please don't use their bathroom, it's quite a disaster.
