My first thought as I walked in here was could there be any more poker players in here?  Anyways..I didn't love this place but I thought it was decent.  I also thought it was interested that the majority of staff there were Japanese as opposed to most places around LV.  My wife certainly appreciated the abundance of natto on the menu too.\n\nI kinda felt like the special rolls they made were a bit on the small side.  You'd have to drop at least $40 each to feel full I'd think.  I'd probably lean more towards entrees w\/ a couple of handrolls the next time I go.  \n\n3.5 stars but closer to 4 than 3.
