Dishonest. Here's the catch: they charge a minimum of $39.95 for any size prescription and they do not tell the public this upfront. I found out the hard way that the same medication at Walgreens is $11.00 (yes, you can get meds for your pets at Walgreens and other pharmacies.)\nI was told by supervisor Summer that I had no recourse after I made the purchase, even though they claim to have a guarantee.\nThey give away little cat & dog toys to make you think they are nice but beware, they are robbing the public.
