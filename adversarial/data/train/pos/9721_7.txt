Guess what?\n\nPAN serves Brunch on Saturday and Sunday. (and the menu looks amazing)\nPAN has a rooftop patio.\nPAN has a new dinner and cocktail menu.\nPAN's emphasis is on natural ingredients and modern Asian dishes.\nPAN's happy hours are 5--7 Tuesday thru Friday, and noon-3 on Saturday and Sunday.\nPAN offers catering.\n\nI learned this from viewing their website when I arrived home from the night. However,  I would have preferred to hear it during the event, since it is always nice to hear about a business and what they have to offer, in order to encourage me to want to come back. The food industry is quite competitive, so it always helps to make yourself stand-out.\n\nYelp events are a great way to meet-up with fellow yelpers and try new places.\nThis event succeeded in this regard.  I had a great time, the staff worked very hard to keep us going.  Unfortunately, interaction between the staff and their yelper guests were at a bare minimum.  I was starting to wonder if we were really welcomed in their restaurant, or were they just making the best of it.\n\nPAN looks like it has a lot to offer, and I am glad I had the opportunity to be part of the night.  I have attended a handful of yelp events, and they were superior in every way, so I have to admit that this event cannot compare to these past experiences.  Confusion and the lack of communication interferes with the flow of an event this size.\n\nMany thanks to the organizers and staff for a night out with fellow yelpers, and for providing some very tasteful dishes.  The fried tofu and edamame hummus were my two favorites.
