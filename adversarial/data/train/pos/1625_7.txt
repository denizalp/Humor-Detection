I love a good hole in the wall and The Cotton Room may be my new favorite now that CuCopper is closed. There is literally something in the air in The Cotton Room. Upon entering, my friends and I suffered from coughing fits. Not sure whether there's lingering saw dust from construction of TCR, particles from the construction next door, or just dust without ventilation, but we had to go after one drink due to the poor air quality. \n\nTuberculosis aside, the drinks here were very reasonably priced ($5 rum on a Friday) and I wished that we came here before Valhalla for happy hour. They were also tasty, not too strong, not too weak. The bartender was very kind and precise. He looked like he was mixing chemicals for an experiment.\n\nI wish they had food, but given the number of restaurants around, you can find eats nearby.
