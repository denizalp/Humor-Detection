The concept is good - large wine and beer selection, cheese plates, dark, chill atmosphere. But the place has been ridiculously loud and overcrowded almost every time I've ever been there. (Like to the point where you start casing the joint to figure out just how the hell you'd save your own life in case of fire.) \n\nService is borderline atrocious. Sure, their beer selection is good but after I get my beer from the cooler, I don't appreciate waiting 20 minutes and desperately trying to flag somebody down to open the damn thing for me. (Strictly forbidden to open your own, of course). 'Servers' are usually too busy listening to the sound of their own voice as the chat about this wine or that wine to actually POUR the wine! I appreciate a knowledgeable bartender as much as the next guy, but seriously, can you not pour wine and talk at the same time??\n\nThe older I get, good beer\/wine selection is not enough to entice me to deal with the bad service and obnoxious crowds found here on weekends and some weeknights. The dark, basement, cave shtick really doesn't work when the place is packed to the gills with yelling, obnoxious college\/grad students.\n\nThis is definitely a weeknight-only type of place for me, if that. It would take a lot of begging to get me there on a weekend again.
