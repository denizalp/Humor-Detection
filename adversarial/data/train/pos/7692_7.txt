Yelp, u embarrassed me. from all the spectacular reviews, I thought this place would be a great place to bring my wife for a treat. We were put into a room and the only thing a lady asked us was how long of a massage we wanted. My wife was never given an option for a female masseuse. Another thing, we were never asked if we had any problem areas or areas to focus on. The communication barrier at the place was terrible. That should have been a sign for us to leave, but we stuck through it since Yelp said this place was so awesome. \n\nI had a fantastic lady with halitosis although she attempted to mask it with mint gum. I got super relaxed at one point but her phone went off; all downhill from that point on. She took some more calls through the whole session. Annoying! Another problem were the coworkers talking to each other in Mandarin. They said some words that were insulting to my wife and I. My wife bit her tongue and didn't say anything because she wanted to snap at them!\n\nAt the end, it was awkward paying the bill because our massage people hung around the front counter till they heard what they got for a tip. \n\none generous star for the value \none generous star for the cashier - the only person we understood at the place\n\nwhat about the massage review? I'm fat and my masseuse crushed me like I was skin and bones. She had a strong, but not so soothing touch and the same goes for my wife's masseur.
