I thought I had reviewed this place but come to think about it, coming here to start off my cousin's bachelorette fiesta I remember why I probably shouldn't go into much detail.\n\nOne of the maid of honor's set up all the logistics and our entire party of sexy ladies made our way past the ropes and escorted to our table. We were treated to bottle service of champ and ice cold top shelf vodka, with mixers of course cause we classy ladies don't get dirty till much later in the evening ;). \n\nOn the way to our tables in a ballroom\/staged area I noticed a large seperate room for the dudes to hang out. Personally I would've rather been in that room and watch ladies dance rather than have saggy balls in my face but alas, I digress. We stayed for the (1 hr.) cheesy all-male dance ensemble, watched women get flipped over upside down, witnessed heavy grinding and pure adulterated fun.
