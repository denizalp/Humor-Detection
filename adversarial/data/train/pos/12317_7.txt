\"This is what dim sum was like in the 80s. We are saving like $5 by coming now - not worth it. I am going to have to stand at the front to hear our number. Well priced and good food - not a bad place if you are retired and on a fixed income and you go on a weekday.\"\n\nWe targeted a 9AM Friday arrival since we had to be up early and had the day off. Minor emergency and we landed there at 10AM instead. Because we were only two, the wait was projected at 30 mins and actual was 45 mins. We had filled out the dim sum order form and handed it over as we were seated. 30 minutes later our dishes arrived en masse rather than gradually.\n\nWe had\nCha Siu Cheng Fon - looked average but there was a lot of tasty cha siu inside the silky noodles\nSiu Mai - Delicious staple\nHam Siu Gok - these are nicknamed dinosaur eggs in our family. They made a good version of these sweet, rounded, chewy pork dumplings\nDough Fritter Cheung Fon - Different, more savory with bonito flakes on top. My husband liked this more than others.\nAlmond crusted shrimp balls - much like the outside shell of a crab claw, this was ground up deep fried shrimp. I loved how they crusted the outside with sliced almonds. This is their own unique dish and it was my favourite.\n\nService I would say was average. When clearing a dirty serving dish from our table, the person stacked someone else's dirty dish on top of it right on our table. They asked us if our teapot needed refilling (cap was up for a while) when we were clearly finished with wallet out on the table.
