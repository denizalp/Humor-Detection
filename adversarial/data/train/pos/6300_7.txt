For anyone planning to attend this school, the high school experience is whatever you make of it. \n\n3 stars for the student environment. As with most high schools, the social life is still held back by cliques and status quo's. \n\nAnd as far as security goes the place is pretty safe from external threats and they still practice fire drills. Internally though, there are some bullies in school and there are many times where I have seen school officials turn a blind eye to it.\n\nBut 5 stars to the teachers here, they are just superb. A majority of them genuinely care about your well being and education. Many times I've seen teachers give a helping hand to anyone with academic or personal problems. And on top of that some volunteer to stay after school and help guide newly made clubs.\n\nPro tip! If you want to get the most out of high school join clubs! Seriously you meet so many people that would you would've never meet in class.
