Do not go here!   I had a body wrap and it was a competely unprofessional experience.  It was in a tiny room very unspa like, more amaturish.  When it was time to take a shower which was in the same room, the employee did not leave the room and in fact stayed and watched.  Terrible experience. Overpriced too.
