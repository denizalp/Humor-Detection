Tons of yummy delights at this location.  I didn't find the staff too friendly but def enjoyed my food. All kinds of items were being ordered which all looked tasty.  Expect lines at this busy and casual location.  They have lots of seating for groups or for yourself.  It's noisy and bustling with energy.
