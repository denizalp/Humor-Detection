My first Yelp review! And it's for XS!! Very appropriate as it's my favorite club bar NONE. I'm sure XS would be the number one ranked club in the world if there were some best nightclubs in the world annual rankings but since there isn't you've gotta trust me on this as I've been to clubs in at least 2 different cities. Why do I like XS so much? hmmm that's tough... maybe it's because they have unpretentious bouncers who actually try to move the line as quickly as possible and get people inside, or it could be the amazingly spacious and stunning indoor and outdoor areas which make every other club in Vegas seem cramped (except for Pure), or is it the four large bars which make getting a drink little less stressful (2 indoor and 2, larger, outdoor bars), or is it the nice mix of hip hop, house and trance, or maybe it's because they actually have blackjack and craps INSIDE so there's no excuse for my gamblaholic friends not to go clubbin. Eh I don't really know, sometimes I think I like XS so much just because the place is so symmetrical.  Whatever it is, it's kept me coming back on every trip to Vegas since the place opened in early 09. And I'm still not bored of it. In fact, I look forward to XS on every trip to Vegas, the place is just that good.
