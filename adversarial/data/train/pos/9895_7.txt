I can't stand this place. I hate that they are open 24 hours and that I am forced to go there when I need something late at night. There are always lines to check out. I'm pretty convinced that there must be people who actually live there, which is why they always appear to be so busy. The characters in the parking lot are questionable at best. and I always feel a little uneasy leaving my car there with the rogue shopping carts and seedy grifters and drifters walking around. I keep swearing to myself that I'll never go back, but for some reason or other, I always find my way back there. \n\nGhettomart is a funny nickname for it...but completely appropo.
