Pho Tempe holds the crown as the absolute worst dining experience of my life. Aside from having bland beef pho and a forgettable attempt at banh mi, Pho Tempe was filthy and doomed by poor service.\n\nI called to ask when the restaurant would close on a Monday night, and the man on the phone was impossible to understand. He said something about 9 p.m. He also said something about 10. \n\nIs it open from 9 a.m. to 10 p.m.? Lobby open till 9 and carryout till 10?\n\nTo be safe, I hopped on GrubHub and submitted my order while driving to the restaurant. \n\nWhen I arrived, I explained I would like to use a Groupon to pay for my order. The woman working at the restaurant, in broken English, told me I couldn't use my Groupon for a carryout order. \n\nThat's fine, I told her, we could just save the Groupon for another time. \n\nShe told me to just eat the meal there, and all would be OK.\n\nSo I sat down and was brought a menu. She asked me to order. I told her I just wanted what I already had ordered on GrubHub. She said to forget about the GrubHub order and just order again. \n\nI asked if the online order would be cancelled. She said yes. So I ordered. And halfway through my meal, out came a second meal in to-go containers.\n\nSo there I was, full of food and staring at the same meal packed for later. The woman already had redeemed my Groupon, and she expected payment for the second meal. \n\nPut in a terrible situation by her inability to communicate or find a compromise, I simply tipped well and walked out on the to-go order.\n\nThe entire experience was so upsetting, I won't return to Pho Tempe.
