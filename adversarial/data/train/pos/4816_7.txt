My whole work staff ordered from here and the food was not good... at all. \nWe actually all ordered something different too so it wasn't a fluke with one item. Everyone felt sick the rest of the day and one of my coworkers actually threw out his sub and went to jersey mikes instead.\nThe Philly cheesesteaks were super greasy and almost burnt with little to no cheese and all the pizzas we ordered were flat out gross and inedible. \n\nI'd never come back here\n\nMac shack needs to come back asap
