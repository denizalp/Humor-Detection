I won't go back to Victoria since I got an infection under my thumb gel nail.  When I went back to this salon, the owner seemed preturbed and gave me 'medicine' to put on it.  She drew on a flower over the gel nail, trying to hide the green fungus under my nail.  She made me feel like it was my fault.  When I was getting the last set of gel nails done, the technician was doing someone else at the same time.  I was horrified and should have said something.  Definitely goes against all hygiene rules.  Will never... EVER go back here.
