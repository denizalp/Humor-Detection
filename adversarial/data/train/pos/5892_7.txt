Just attempted to dine here as I had heard good things.  We walked into the restaurant and we not greeted.  We stood there awkwardly and then decided to seat ourselves.  We were there for about 5 minutes when we were never given a menu or even had our presence acknowledged.  We left without a trace!  We headed to Kaizen where the service is impeccable!
