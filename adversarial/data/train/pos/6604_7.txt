Five Guys Burgers is an OK place.  I stopped here with four friends after being at Red Rock Canyon.  I have never been to a Five Guys and I didn't know what to expect.  The four people I was with had all been there and were fans.\n\nThey explained that the regular was a double patty so I ordered the \"little\" bacon cheeseburger.  I got my burger with lettuce, jalape√±os, and grilled mushrooms.\nThe people I was with took care of ordering two medium fries for the five of us and that was plenty.\n\nThe burger was a nondescript piece of cooked, ground beef.   There was one half of a piece of lettuce that was only partly on the patty.  There were no mushrooms that I could see anywhere.  The bacon was crumbled pieces of bacon on the bottom bun under the burger, not the more common bacon slices you'd get at most places.\n\nThe fries were good. I liked the amount of salt they used.  Had I been ordering for myself, I would have ordered cajun fries but alas I wasn't.\n\nThe fact that they have free peanuts to snack on before the burger comes or after or to take a bag home with you didn't phase me at all.  I think I had three peanuts and that was good enough.\n\nThe place doesn't deserve a 2 star rating but I really hate to round it to three.  The fries will push it to a three.  Let's just say it's not a place to which I'd return!  Also, the music was BLARING!  It was awful!!!
