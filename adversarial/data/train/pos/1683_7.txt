People of Pittsburgh, I think we all need to have a sit down conversation about this place.  You guys...sorry, yinz are waxing nostalgic about something that lost it's luster years ago.\n\nIs it a landmark in the community, sure.  Is it a go to place to pick up a full grocery list, no.  To me, at this point, ShurSave is nothing more than a place holder.  There, I said it.\n\nIf you want this place to improve, you need to have it be competitive in pricing for one.  This is basically an IGA, and the prices are never better at an IGA.  What needs to happen here is let them do what they want with this piece of land and improve it.  But I just dangled a piece in front of a NIMBY (Not In My Back Yard) that is just too much for them to handle.\n\nI really didn't want to hate this place as much as I did, but there really isn't anything redeeming about this place.
