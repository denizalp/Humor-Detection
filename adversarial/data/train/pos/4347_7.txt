I really do like the WYNN better than the BELLAGIO. reason being:\nWynn Buffet has Kobe Sliders!! YUMMM. I ate like 5 of those babies. The deli meat selection was OMG yummy. Fresh salami and mortadella and proscuitto :) And there were fresh cheeses too - my fave: Smoked Gouda :) \nBeing the cheap-o asian at heart, I came here on a Sunday at 2:00 pm so that I could pay Brunch price and at 3:30 dinner items start to roll out :) That means MORE variety and MORE dessert selections! WOOT! The curry I had from the dinner menu was yummy. \n\nBEWARE THOUGH: My friend found a piece of HAIR in his plate of food. It was in the chinese broccoli that he got from the asian section. (Go figure if anywhere it would be there, HAHHA) A manager promptly handled the matter and we got COMPED for his meal.\n\nOverall, that doesn't affect my review because I was super happy with my meal (my other friends too) and the service was very attentive and prompt to handle our situation.
