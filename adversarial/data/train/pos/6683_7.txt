I applied online for approval for this apartment. William, one of the people working in the leasing office, called me 3 different times asking about birth dates and my child's information. I was working and did get annoyed and talked to him slowly and with an irritated voice... Cmon people, you have an online application. I mentioned I had a dog and asked how much deposits would be. When I went to sign the lease, William was rude saying I never mentioned a dog and my co signer would have to sign a new lease (conducted through email and Mail previously as he lives out of town). William stated I would not be moving in on that day and in the 7 years of him writing leases he never messes up and when a tenant tells him something he writes it down. I asked if he was calling me, the customer, a liar. He said, \"well...\"  I followed up with if he wrote everything down that people tell him he wouldn't have had to call me three times for birth dates and would have had all tenants on the lease the first time I told him a child would be living there as well. I requested to speak to Ana who was much more accommodating and able to get the paperwork done that day. Even she stated I never mentioned a dog but it was on my online application. Apartment is nice so far. Sergio in the office is great for paying rent. Avoid William...
