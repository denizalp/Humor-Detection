Would give minus stars if possible. \n\nHorrible, horrible place. Shoddy quality rooms, outdated and overpriced. You can stay at much nicer hotels on the strip for less. \n\nIf you're seriously considering doing the timeshare thing as an investment, don't. You'd be better off financially just flushing $20,000 down the toilet.\n\nStay away, or be sorry!!\n\n... On the bright side, the Cirque du Soleil tickets were nice. Not worth sitting through the horrendous presentation and tour though.
