This place has some good glazed donuts and the sized just right. I mean really huge. I wasn't too thrilled with the selection but that was ok because when the craving for a donut comes it comes fast and furious.  \n\nI love the fact that this local donut joint is open 24 hours.  Donut Tyme actually fits right in on Charleston.  that whole section of the building has that step back in time feeling.  I love the old school feel.  When pulling up to the place images or flashbacks of old cop cars come to mind with cops eating inside the joint. \n\nThese donuts are pretty good even though the selection is small. I REALLY wish the selection had blueberry donuts or something strawberry glazed.    I know if Im in the area Im defiantly thinking about stopping here.  I compare this joint to winchells without the famous name.  Donuts to me are still KING of the sweets!  I can have an awesome day at the gym and drive by Donut time and it's like the car takes control of my willpower and parks itself in front of the store and I walk into the place all zombie like ready to stuff my face with the tasty donuts.  This place will live to fight many more days......you understand!  lol
