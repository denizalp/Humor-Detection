Came in with some pretty high expectations, unfortunately, the food didn't match the ambiance. \n\nWeekends can be really busy so we decided a weekday stop would give us a chance to let the food and the place sink in. Everything about the appearance gets 5 Star from me. It looks like a Magazine staged restaurant showcase\/showroom floor. The Bloody Mary bar, boom.... staff (Dominic the manager & our server) ... on point. So what could go wrong right your asking??? \n\nNothing on the menu jumped out to our likings (took us forever to decide) so I hit Yelp and looked at pictures. We decided on the Avocado Toast, kids chocolate chip pancakes & the flat iron Steak & eggs. When the food came I was surprised that my steak was so small. Eggs were hot, but the steak was well done (ask for it medium) and the hash-browns were like baby ice cubes... cold. No issues when I told the staff but it should of never came out to the table that way. Kids pancakes were the same way, just lukewarm. Got the new steak and realized it's just s tough piece of meat and not good. The sauce with the steak wasn't that good either. I ate the avocado toast (way to many leeks) but it was bland. I've had so much better. \n\nThe presentations have people at nearby tables complimenting left & right... but I think they were lit from the drinks. This will sound weird, but I think the presentations & stellar menu of drinks make everyone down play the flavors of the food. (Not just my observation)\n\nI plan to come back as everything from the vibe to the drinks are enticing, but with the hopes of changing my 1st experience.
