Oh no, another bad experience at this specific location. I came here one day before New Year's Eve and our waiter Matthew was a disaster. First of all he came up talking to me from behind (instead of facing me first as it would be polite) so I got scared and jumped. I told him that he scared me, I didn't know he was there talking to me... instead of an apology, he said: \"You have bad nerves!?\" OMG. I would never say like this to my customer when clearly it would have been my fault. I told him nicely that \"no, I don't have bad nerves, just he should have talked to me while facing me\". He just shrugged and did not apologize.\nAfter that my friend ordered couple of teas for her and kids, Matthew brought the cups with tea spoons inside, no coasters or plates underwear, he did not offer or bring sugar. One of the kids is allergic to lactose, so when we asked if they have lactose free milk or any other substitute, he was very uninterested, saying \"No\". His attitude was very vulgar and he was not friendly, therefore we decided not to order food here but go elsewhere. He came up rushing asking if we need a bill in the middle of our conversation, and even if I said not yet, he brought it in 2 minutes! When we left, he ignored us and didn't even say \"good bye, thank you for coming.\" I complained to the hostess but I am not sure if she addressed the issue with management.
