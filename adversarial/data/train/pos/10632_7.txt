It was an interesting experience, to say the least.  Everything was carved out of ice, even the glasses, and you had to wear gloves so that the heat from your hands didn't destroy the sculpture.  We paid the extra money for the fur coats, thinking we'd look like a pair of pimps. I would have opted for the white one, but that was reserved for the ladies, so me and my buddy got the black ones - he looked like a bulky Ivan the Terrible and I looked like a paunchy Drag Queen.  We did get the keepsake hats, which are cool, and the pictures we got with the package will probably never see the light of day, so do yourself a favor and go with the slightly cheaper package.  \n\nThe drinks are generous, with enough booze to warm your insides, and the air is clean and nice - almost bland, like Canada.  \n\nThe bartender was cool, taking a liking to my Hunter S. Thompson glasses and visor, which I insisted on wearing on top of the furry hat.  What do you want: it's a statement.
