If Shake Shack comes to LA, I will definitely be there!  My Shackburger with cheese was great, & so was the chocolate & vanilla custard.  The Smokeshack was a little heavy on the smoky for my taste, though.\n\nSeating inside or out is comfortable, & service was super friendly.  Parking at New York New York was easy, too : )
