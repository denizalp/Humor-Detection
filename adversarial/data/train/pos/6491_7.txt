Would give them zero stars if I could. Walked in w my daughter, ready to buy a bed. No one greeted us. Then finally walked by the counter. Two ladies behind the counter semi looked up for a sec and looked back down without greeting us. Went back to enjoying their chocolate dipped ice cream cones. My daughter finally picked out a bed and we were the only ones in the store . We waited  and one of the ladies looked up and saw we were interested but hurried and looked back down, finishing her ice cream cone. and they still did not want to get up and help us. So we left.  Horrible.
