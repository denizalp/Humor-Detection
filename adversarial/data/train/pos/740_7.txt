On my last trip to Vegas a week ago (12\/2016) I heard about this AYCE sushi place that was to die for. Checking on Yelp, I saw they have over 1400 reviews at 4.5 stars, so that was enough for me to round up a gang of 8 for an early dinner. \n\nWe arrived around 3:30ish, missing the lunch cut-off, so each had to pay an extra 5 bucks. \nLunch: $20.95\nDinner: $25.95\n\nThe place was half full. The decor was busy and some replica vintage items rest on shelves for an added touch. The ayce menu had many items and can be overwhelming, especially when the server has an impatient look on her face everytime she came by to tke our order. We were handed a sheet to mark our orders, but no explanations were given that even though the paper only lists round 1 & 2, we can actually order more if needed. \n\nA few of us wanted hot water (because it was cold and it's better for digestion) but we were told they don't have hot water, only hot tea @ $1.50 \/ cup. Really? What do you use to make hot tea if you don't have hot water?? \n\nWe ordered some sodas, and they brought out the wrong ones, so we had to flag another server down to have that corrected. \n\nThe rolls and nigiri we ordered were good, for the most part. (see my photos) The uni was subpar. It was runny, pale in color and had a weird texture, as if it's been dunked in water. \n\nThe freshwater eel was the highlight, as it tasted fresh w\/ a semi-sweet sauce drizzled over it. We ordered some extra plates of this. \n\nThe food selection, flavor and portions (fish to rice ratio) earns them a 4, or even 4.5 for a few in our party, but the whole experience of dining there dropped it down. \n\nLet me explain: \n* After our first round was finished, no one ever came by to hand us an additional order sheet, menu or even ask if we needed anything. I had to go up to the cashier and grab it myself ... repeatedly.\n* The music selection was annoying. K-pop (Korean pop music) was blasting above our heads. This is obviously targeting a certain market, not the majority. \n* Though I saw many kids in there, they played music videos with skanky girls in string bikinis shaking their thang. Maybe it's a Vegas thing but not really approriate for kids, no? \n* A few of the servers were pleasant, but a couple of them plain looked pissed off whenever we asked for something. Perhaps they should work at DMV, they will fit right in. \n\nWill we come back? No, not again as a big group. Though the food was pretty good, their lack of patience and explanation for first timers didn't sit well with me. In addition, lying to us about not having hot water and forcing us to pay for hot tea (which tasted like colored water) did not set a good impression for management, and also the annoying loud teenie bopper music selection didn't make for a comfortable dining environment, as we had trouble carrying on  conversations. \n\nFood: solid 4+\nAmbience\/ Service: 2\nAvg: 3
