Good location on W 6th so you can either stop in at work during the week or it's really convenient for anyone who lives down town.  They even have Saturday hours which was a very unexpected surprise.\n\nTwo things will keep me coming back.  If any of these change, we might have issues:\n\n1)  The barbers seem to all strike that perfect balance of \"I'll talk to you if you want, but if you're not in the mood, we can do the tough-guy no-talking act and just make this transactional\"  Nothing is worse than a chatty barber when you're just exhausted and want to take a nap\n\n2)  They practice the lost art of hot shaving cream to cut the hair on the back of your neck.  Even if you regularly are in the tough-guy no-talking mood you know this is really why you go to the barber instead of Great Clips\n\nAs a note, I noticed that, on yelp, many barbers in Cleveland seem to have incredibly high ratings (4.5 or 5).  I don't want to do this place a disservice by giving it a 4...  but if you all love your barber's that much you've got issues.
