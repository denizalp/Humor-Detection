DO NOT GO HERE IF YOU BLACK (:), All you will find here is minorities being racist to minorities;  Nick refused to cut my hair.   I went here because by the recommendation of another posted review.   If you cannot cut a regular (guard 1 )fade on a black guy you should not be cutting hair.  End of story and shame on the owners for allowing this.\n\n\nIn the alternative, I would recommend \"Nappy by Nature\" on Bethany Home Road or if you're at Baller status and you only want to make an appointment (because you like to jump right in the chair) I would go to \"Cut Throat \" on Stetson drive in Scottsdale. Barbers in both locations know how to cut all types of hair.
