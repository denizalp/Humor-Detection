Last night, I had to rush my baby girl to the hospital. I notice that she was not moving from her bed and when she came into my room, she puked and pooped everywhere. This is not like her, so I knew right away that she was sick and in pain. Hospital closed at 10pm, it was already 9 so I called to make sure they would still be able to see her. We arrived around 9:10 and immediately was escorted into a room. A nurse came in to take information from me and five minutes later the doctor came. He explained all the possibilities she could have and what the options we had. We decided to do some fluids under the skin, a shot for her vomiting and some meds to go. Over all the nurses and doctor were super nice. This is not my pups Veterinarian but I fell in love and I can definitely recommend it to others who have furry babies. I only paid around $150 so not bad at all.
