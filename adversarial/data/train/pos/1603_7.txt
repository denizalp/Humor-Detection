Mas Amigos is, consistently, the best place to get Mexican food in C-U.  Their staff are incredibly friendly, and the place always feels warm and welcoming whenever I enter.  I invariably get something with chorizo because 1) They do it well here and 2) I EFFING LOVE CHORIZO AND YOU CANNOT TELL ME ANY DIFFERENT SO THERE.\n\nWhen life is hard or you want a moment to celebrate an accomplishment in grad school (end of a conference, successful presentation, glad you survived another week) then it is time to pitch in for a pitcher or three of margaritas.  They are decently sized, about the right strength, and although a little too sweet, still manage to make a fun evening even more fun.  \n\nAnd if this hasn't convinced you of the joys of Mas Amigos, know that it also boasts a view of the wonderfully dubious C-U landmark, Illini-Arcade.  Yes, that's right, you can see the wooden fence that obscures the parking lot of the sex emporium known as Illini Arcade whilst you enjoy delicious Mexican food and\/or watch awesome Spanish language TV.\n\nI'm just saying, it makes for a wonderful night.  Also, CHORIZO.
