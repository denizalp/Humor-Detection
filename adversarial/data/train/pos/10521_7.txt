I've never been in a wine store and been blown away. Truve reminds me of the wine stores in Napa Valley. The rooms are just gorgeous with a beautiful set-up. There is a stunning room in the back, which I'm guessing can be rented out for private parties.\n\nAside from the gorgeous venue, the prices are freaking awesome! I really liked the wines I tried. My favourite was the Octavia Chardonnay, a tropical creamy white for only $20 and Dillon's Unfiltered Gin ($32), which was unusual (compared to my Hendricks and Bombay). I was told NOT to use the cheap gin and tonic and go for the speciality stuff, which makes a huge difference. Pretty much you can shop in style and pay the same price you would pay at the dive store in the strip mall nearish to your house.\n\nGrumans Catering whipped up these beautiful cucumber and salmon bites. One18 Empire served up a top quality display of cheeses and meats. I have to check both Grumans and One18 out soon. One18 is by my workplace and the lunch menu looks great and will get you in and out in a reasonable time. You can pick an appy and main for $15, apply, main, and dessert for $19, or a quick burger for only $10. \n\nDale, not sure how you come up and collaborate with all these wonderful businesses for these fantastic events. Your parties are first-rate and one of the reasons I Yelp. Can't wait for the next event to get exposed to more great restaurants and libations.
