Amazing menu, amazing food, love their Sangria too.  Very nice outdoor seating with heaters when it is chilly.  They have live music, usually a person with a guitar and a lot of talent.  I was there to early for the music last night but had the opportunity to enjoy the music in the past.  \n\nI love their seafood options which are all very good.  The other options look great too.  I always have great food here.   I love the ambience there too, very cozy, even outside.  Service has never been a problem, neither has parking, again, no valet, yay!  I need to come here more often!
