I hate to say it, but I like this place. Some may be turned off the the over-flare-ification of the interior or the high-priced Mexican fare (at least compared to hole-in-the-wall spots). But, the tacos and street corn won me over. The char and prominent cotija flavor of the former make it worth getting, especially when it's free for checking in. \n\nAs for the tacos, the pork belly is my favorite. Balanced sweet and savoriness, varied texture with the cabbage mix and most importantly it was topped with chicharrones. What's not to like? The barbacoa was a close runner-up. Who cares if it was messy with its sauce dripping everywhere. It's still bold flavored and delicious. \n\nLess noteworthy, but still decent were the chicken tacos and carnitas. Taco platters come with two tacos, which you can mix-and-match. Rice and beans can be hit or miss. The first time around the rice was better than almost any rice I've tried at a Mexican restaurant -- light, fluffy and buttery. The second time around... not so much. Still, Hussongs is a worthy spot to hit up as long as you don't mind paying a little more for tacos.\n\n3.5 Stars
