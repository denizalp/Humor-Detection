I'm so impressed. Annette just left my house and I just had to take the time to come on here and rave about her work and how much she impressed me, which is something I usually don't take the time to do. Her friendly demeanor put me at ease as soon as I met her and her attention to detail and work ethic really impressed me. She went the extra mile by cleaning things I didn't even know were dirty. She even steam mopped my white tile floors and they look brand spanking new, as well as soaking my shower handle to get all the gunk off and cleaning the inside of my microwave. I'm very impressed and would recommend her highly!
