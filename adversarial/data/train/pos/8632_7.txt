Hmmm.... In the Mall food court they always have a cheesesteak place. We stopped to get Cheese Fries.\n My son got cheese fries with bacon and he ate them all.\n I got just Cheese Fries. I added salt but still very little flavor.\n The size was very small for what we paid. The Blueberry Lemonade was good, but made with kind of Blueberry compote. It was thick and sludgy, almost like over poked boba. My grandson shared with me and every time he got a blueberry he gagged.\n We got him a Chicken Finger kids meal. The fingers were over cooked and dry, they tasted vaguely of freezer burn. The finger meal comes with NO dipping sauce. I asked for ranch and they said its extra, but then gave it to me free.\n We won't be going back. It's was Meh at best.
