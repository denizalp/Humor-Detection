Minus the fact that the owners changed, the shisha is always the same.\nIf your actually a shisha smoker I do not recommend this place at all. \n\nThe environment with even its new developments is still for teenagers, who see friends after school type thing. FYI this is no afterschool special. \n\nIf your going for the food, I wouldnt say your crazy... maybe crazy to eat in such a barbaric atmospher but hey I won't judge. You won't leave the place not feeling like you went to some sort of smack down wwe welfare jam, I guarantee anytime after 6pm there will be some sort of argument that gets twisted and chairs will be thrown around. \n\nThe only season I recommend Alexandria, is in the summer when you can take advantage of the patio, However the seasons change but the people surely do not.\n\nAs for alcoholic  bevarages: None sold inside but if you check out the parking lot I'm sure you'll see cars and pockets filled with them. (Do make friends)\n\nDel Toro,\nCheers
