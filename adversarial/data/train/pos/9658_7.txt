I stopped by here this past Saturday with my wife for breakfast.  We decided on the California Coffee Bar because it was close to our house and they had been at the latest community Yelp party.  The inside of this place gives off a homey feel with lots of wood colors everywhere.  The coffee bar is situated in the middle of the restaurant here with seating on both sides and had a number of different pastries which you could also buy.  Last but not least there is an elevated seating area complete with wall fireplace.\n\nFor breakfast on this morning I decided to get a 12 oz dark roast coffee and a Greek yogurt bowl while my wife also went with a 12 oz dark roast and an oatmeal bowl.  In both their oatmeal and Greek yogurt bowls you are allowed to choose 3 mixins and so I went with chia seeds, bee pollen and raspberries while my wife went with strawberries, granola and local honey.  Within a few minutes our food was delivered to our table and looked quite pretty.  It ended up tasting very good as I made the correct choice with the raspberries and bee pollen providing some sweetness to the natural tartness of the Greek yogurt.  My wife also really enjoyed her oatmeal and loved the toppings that she picked, especially the local honey.  Last but certainly not least is their coffee which i found to be flavorful, strong and most importantly smooth.\n\nThe bottom line for me is that I would head back here again in the future.  I liked everything about this place from the service to the food and the coffee as well.
