*Sigh*\n\nI have been going to Martini Ranch for years. Back in my partying days it was our weekend hang out. Shaker room then go across the street to Mickey's Hangover and eat greasy fries.\n\nNow I only find myself going there for live bands. They get some great local bands there sometimes. And their regular bands, Rock Lobster and Metalhead are always a fun time.\n\nTheir staff isn't the best. Bartenders are grouchy. Their security annoys the hell out of me. Last time we were there, a bouncer stood right in front of me impeding my view of the band. And he was texting. What a great work ethic.\n\nDrinks cost an arm and a leg. Which is stupid when you are already paying a ridiculous cover.  \n\nBut alas... you know I will be back.
