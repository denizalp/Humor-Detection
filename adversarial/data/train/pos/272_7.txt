This place is a total dump.\n\nSterile environment, awful seating, poor concession offerings, disgusting public restrooms, horrendous parking options, and to top it off you're hit up by bums walking in.\n\nThis arena manages to be a complete 180 from the facility it effectively replaced: Richfield Coliseum.\n\nSecurity, vendors and concessionaires are not very bright, rarely ever friendly and generally make for a bad entertainment experience. \n\nProps to Cavs owner Dan Gilbert for injecting some much needed cash for capital improvements, but you can only polish a turd so much before you give up and say it's still a turd.\n\nOh, and FlashSeats, yeah, they blow.  20% to be inconvenienced, and to line the pockets of the Cavs.
