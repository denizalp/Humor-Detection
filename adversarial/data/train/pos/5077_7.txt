If I could give them zero. I would. This was the worse food I have ever had in my life. If I wanted unseasoned canned vegetables I would have went to target. And my food was cold to the touch. The jerk chicken, the collard greens and these disgusting canned sweet potatoes were all cold. I asked for a side of jerk sauce to pour over my cold rice...miraculously that came out steaming... After sitting with a cold plate for 30 minutes. The waitress never returned so I went to the bar to pay for our meals.. I was given the 1 minute finger while she answered the phone and took an order for 15 minutes. I asked someone else to process my payment. They told me to wait until the other girl got off the phone. Oh ok. STAY AWAY. Thank goodness it's Super Bowl Sunday and I'm headed to a party later or I'd surely starve.
