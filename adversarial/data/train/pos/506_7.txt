My wife went to Pork on a Fork tonight for some take out for me and my grandson since she was going out tonight with the girls for Karaoke.\n\nMy grandson got the brisket with a side of Mac & Cheese and waffel fries. I had the BBQ Baby Back Ribs with a side of macaroni salad & BBQ beans. \n\nKeep in mind, I'm not expert on BBQ. But I know food and what I like. The best part is I love giving awesome reviews!  All I can say about my meal is OMG the ribs were sooooooooooooooo good. Imean down right delicious!!!  Not at all greasy . Besides the BBQ ribs the best surprise was the Baked beans, they were great and cooked to perfection, smoky \/ sweet--simply all around fantastic.\n\nTo be honest Just writing this review is making me hungry again for more ribs.  \n\nFOOD:  Pork ribs just fell off the bone they had just the right amount of smoke, moisture, glaze and tenderness without being fatty.  Excellent sauce This is good BBQ... I mean really good. The sauce perfectly complements the meat.\nSERVICE: When I called in the order I was told the ribs were cooking and they would be ready in 1-1\/2 hours. They were done exactly on time as promised. CONCLUSION: Isn't all barbeque supposed to be like this. Don't bother with all the other bbq places, just come here.
