If you want to stump the scheduler, ask her for their AZ contractor license number. Oops!  She first said \"who are you?\" Like I just asked for her SSN or something?  When I informed her that I was a scheduled appt in ten minutes, and that she could either provide the license number or cancel my appt she informed me that I would have to wait for her supervisor who happened to be in a meeting. I suggested she look at a business card, that a reputable contractor would have it listed, she informed me that she was just a scheduler. Wow, if their customer service people are this inept how must the rest of the gang be? I said goodbye and amazingly my sales guy never showed up. I guess she was at least a good listener!  They must have lots of customers with low expectations as they never made a follow up call.
