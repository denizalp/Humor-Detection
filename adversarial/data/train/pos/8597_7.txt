Since price and value is a primary factor when I consider what businesses to patronise, 'The Tea Factory' gets a failing grade from me, sorry!\n\nBeing local to me, I thought I had better check this place out.\n\nDon't get me wrong, everything about the place itself is fine. Spacious, clean, staff are human and look like they are liking their jobs, decor is fresh and modern, although the lighting is nigh on laboratory levels... they really should chill out with the brightness, guys, its a cafe, not an interrogation chamber. Use that dimmer!\n\nAlso, whichever genius (not) thought it was a good idea to get the windows coated with 3M nightvision film (or similar if it isn't that) needs his\/her head examined. \n\nIt's a window tint that looks like a mirror outside to passersby in the daytime, and at nighttime, somewhat reverses and takes on a mirror-ish effect inside. So basically, one cannot see out when it's dark. DUH.\n\nMilk\/lids\/stirrer station at the very BACK of the place? Dumb idea.\n\nBut apart from that, its a nice place to sit.\n\nThe big problem though? I looked at the menu board. Holy sh*t they are ambitious. $4.50 for a large cuppa? FOUR FIFTY?!!?\n\nThat's more than starbucks! \n\nStabucks Awake tea uses a pretty good grade of tea in a silk bag too!\n\nSure, they need to pay for that swanky new building they had done, but come on!\n\nYes, the tea is a nice quality, yes you get a decent amount of it in your cup. Yes, it's 12 cents a gramme if you want to buy some, which equates to $120.00 a Kilo.\n\nUnless the ya-ya's and well off, granola muching,organic, vegan volvo driving, african orphan sponsoring yoga crowd and sunterra types* support this place with their oil dollars, I cannot see this place lasting through the winter.\n\nBring the prices down, then I will come back. Until then I will walk a half block more to the Petro Canada and make myself a cuppa with the gourmet teabags they have. May not be exactly the same grade, but close enough, it's not like I choose the red rose crap...\n\n\n*Disclaimer: That was called humour to any yoga types.
