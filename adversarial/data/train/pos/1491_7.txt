I will not buy from Spencer's TV & Appliance in Arrowhead again. I just don't trust the sales people. \n\nWe bought appliances for our vacation home in the high country. We were not looking for the best since it is a 2nd home and we don't anticipate using the appliances on a daily basis. I just wanted something affordable that would get the job done. I purchased a washer, dryer and refrigerator. The dryer does the job, but the washer shreds my clothes - literally. It was sold to me under the guise that it had an upgraded agitator, a delicates cycle and other features. Well, it did not! It is by far the worst major appliance I have ever purchased. The refrigerator is much the same. It does not regulate temperature normally - so one half of it freezes items in the refrigerator portion while the other half of it keeps items at a barely acceptable temperature.  Plus, it is lopsided, and when I shut the refrigerator door, the freezer door pops open.\n\nHow can a place stock these items let alone sell them??? Needless to say, I need to purchase new appliances. But I will never use Spencer's again. The sales people are not knowledgeable about the products they sell. Plus, I don't trust the them to care one way or the other about helping me make the right decision and in selling me products that are not junk!\n\nAnd by the way, I had them for awhile before I used them and found this out, so returning is not possible or I would throw them right back at them!\n\nBe careful if you use Spencer's TV & Appliance in Arrowhead . The sales people are not high pressure sale-persons because they just don't seem to care about selling and really don't seem to have much knowledge of the products at all!
