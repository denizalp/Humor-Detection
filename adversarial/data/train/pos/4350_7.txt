No. No. No!\n\nUnfortunately, this La Quinta Inn falls very short of the standard La Quinta Inn & Suites experience.  We were travel weary and arrived at this hotel nearly 2 in the morning after delays at the airport and at the car rental place.  I would have said we could have probably cared less about where we were staying, but even in this state I was uneasy as we got to our room.   I had made reservations in advance due to the photos on the website\/expedia ratings.  However, I'd have to say the experience wasn't as depicted.   The rate was as advertised, thankfully (I believe we ended up paying $92\/night).  \n\nThe room was ancient.  The hallways were dark and dirty, and the common areas were very outdated.  The bathroom had dirt in the grout lines and shower floors were stained.  I felt very uncomfortable here for safety reasons too.  The locks on the door were substandard.  Unfortunately, I think this location needs a major update.  I would not recommend.
