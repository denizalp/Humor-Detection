THIS POOL IS NOT IDEAL FOR FAMILY WITH LITTLE CHILDREN!!! At the pool right now where there are a lot of grown ups drinking and horsing around at the side of the lazy river which I thought wasn't allowed as it blocks the flow of traffic but the lifeguards here just turn the other way and don't pay attention even if they were throwing ice at each other doing inappropriate things. Were at the Mandalay pool for 2 days and nobody is allowed to hang around on the side of the lazy river. These grown ups should've went either at the pool since they are just getting drunk and staying in one place anyway or at the day club since they enjoy dancing and grinding with each other anyway with  a lot of kids around.
