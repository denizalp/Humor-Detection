9pm and all my friends are gambling or getting ready for clubbing.\nMe current status: in Chinatown making sure i get to try all these popular restaurants! \nRaku was one of them.\n\nHere the reviews:\n\n*Yellowtail carpaccio ($12)\nThe fish was super fresh and the sauce that comes with it! Mmmm! Delicious!\n\n*Steamed foie gras egg custard ($10)\nSuper tasty!!\n\n*Poached egg with sea urchin and salmon roe ($9)\nDefinitely not for everyone due to the texture of it but it was good! They charge me $11 because the uni was a better quality and it was a good move! \n\n*Kurobuta pork cheek ($4.50)\nGotta love that fat!! Delicious!!!\n\n*Kobe beef outside skirt with garlic ($7.50)\nThe meat was soooo tender! Highly recommend it too!\n\n*Butter saut√©ed scallop with soy sauce ($7)\nGood as well! \n\nOverall i am happy i decided to come here! Prices were pretty good too!
