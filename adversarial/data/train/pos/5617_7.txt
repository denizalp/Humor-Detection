Yea, this was NOT a great experience.  \n\nA group of us went yesterday around 11:30 and apparently they had just opened.  The tables and chairs were all wet from the recent wash down on the patio so after drying things off, we finally sat down. \n\nAbout 10 minutes later, a server stopped by (we were the only group there by the way) and asked if we would like drinks.  Yep... most of us ordered beer from the tap.  10 minutes later, we get our drinks.  \n\nIt was a half hour later, I went searching and asked him to come back and take an order for food.  We all placed order for appetizers.\n\nHalf hour more passes..... nothing.... we ask for the appetizers and got some Ore Ida Tater Tots and tacos that Taco Bell could have beat.\n\nNeedless to say - I'm not going back and unless the management figures it out, I'm very sure many others feel the same.
