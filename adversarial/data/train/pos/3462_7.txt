My bookmark note for this place reads like this: Oh yeah!\n\nI grew up eating Dunkin Donuts back when I lived in Manila. It was delicious and the marketing team they had was so clever with the use of donuts for any occasion.\n\nMoving over here in Los Angeles, I didn't think I'd get to eat one again. I have no intentions of going back to Manila and having someone bring it back from their trip seems tedious. So I resolved that I'll never have my favorite donut again.\n\nBut when we took my sister to Vegas for her 21st, she found this location. It's been my must visit Vegas spot since. So not that I need to say it, this review is very, very biased.\n\nGive the raspberry filled munchkin a try :)
