I was hesitant to write a review because I felt sheepish saying that we heartily enjoyed the food but still would never likely return. The reason was that Graft's service was so over-attentive and cloying that we barely got a moment to ourselves on what was intended to be a relaxing, romantic night together. Every dish required an elaborate speech about every minuscule ingredient. The details are there on the menu, so why does each meal's composition require a second recitation? One of two servers - or the manager - stopped by about twice for every course or drink we ordered. At one point we were admittedly canoodling in our booth and the server came by to ask if we were enjoying our meal. Not any more! For Pete's sake, just walk away and let the customers enjoy their meals! I've experienced this same misstep elsewhere in Madison, but never to such a farcical extent. It was really unprofessional. Why can't we emulate Paris, one of the culinary capitals of the world, where servers bring you the food, return when summoned, and otherwise respect your privacy? \nAnother misstep was seating us directly next to a family of small children when the restaurant was otherwise empty. As a former restaurant hostess, I'm aware that that is THE LAST PLACE a young couple wants to be on a romantic night out. \n\nIn any event, there's my two cents. I wanted to like Graft (and still do!) because the decor is absolutely beautiful (puts Estrell√≥n to shame) and the food is tasty on the whole. The pheasant and flank steak were both great. The doughnuts and ice cream for dessert were fantastic. (Drinks and wine selection? Absurdly pricey and off-base for Madison. Show me a decent glass of red for $6.) But I can't ever eat there again if I'm committing to share the experience with half the staff.
