I've driven by this place a few times, and finally stopped in. I came for coffee and I would say first & foremost this place IS a coffee shop, but it's really (a lot) more.\n\nI got an ice coffee & a chocolate chip muffin. The coffee was fine, but the muffin was REALLY good! I could have inquired, but I got the impression this place does most (all?) of there food in house. The muffin was very fresh (and I was here late morning) & was loaded w\/chocolate chips. The other muffins looked good as well.\n\nI'd be curious to come back to this place to try some other stuff. For breakfast they do a lot more than just pastries. They also have breakfast sandwiches & burritos. For lunch they have sandwiches & salads. They also do a different homemade dinner each night after 5 pm, which I'd be curious to try. \n\nThey also advertise an omelette bar on the weekend (or it may have been EITHER Saturday or Sunday...I can't remember) along w\/mimosas an Bloody Mary's. \n\nSpeaking of which, this place serves alcohol (beer & wine at least, but I think they advertise cocktails). \n\nIn addition to ALL this they're also open 24 hrs & have a drive thru.
