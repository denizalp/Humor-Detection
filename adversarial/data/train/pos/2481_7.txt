I gave this place 1 star because the only good thing is the bed is comfortable. This place is probably hell. In fact I am convinced it is hell. It seems like I have time traveled to 1998 as I walked into this room. It smells like 1998 too. The maid is the most annoying person in the world, she stood outside my door for 30 minutes talking about her sex life. I almost threw up. I shouldn't ever know how her vagina works. Sadly, now I do. As if that wasn't annoying enough, there's no point in having a do not disturb sign. They will completely ignore it and come back ever 15-25 minutes to ask if you need anything or just try to walk in your room while you are sleeping. Even though you've told them for the past 4 hours you won't be leaving until later in the evening and you will call when you want the room cleaned. The shower sucks. The room is so creepy I am waiting on an axe murderer to pop out from under the bed and get me. Seriously, don't stay here unless you want to experience hell. Yes, it is that bad.
