I was so impressed by how authentic their Chinese food tastes like.\n\nWhen comes to food, I am more focus into taste than the decoration or quality of service.  You can give me so so service and serve me good food I will still give you 5 stars.\n\nLocated inside Rio Casino. This location is more expensive than its Chinatown original location.  However, the menus offers more choices.\n\nWent there three days in a row during the recent Vegas trip.\n\nMust get - Roast Duck, Fried Rice, House special daily soup, Beef with Vegetables.\n\nMust try - shrimp dumpling, shumai, chicken feet (for lunch\/dimsum).\n\nUsually the waits are not too bad except lunch times for dim sum.  It is cheaper or on par with the dim sum restaurants in LA.  Very competitive prices!
