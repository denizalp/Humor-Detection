I love coming to place for their lunch specials. It's cheap and they give good service for a Chinese restaurant, a major plus for me. I usually have their Teriyaki Chicken and it comes with soup, sweet and sour or chicken corn.. Chicken corn was my choice then you have the option of having salad or egg rolls.. i chose the egg rolls. This is a great place to eat if your in a hurry and if your on a budget. Great value for a sit down restaurant, the service is great they are on top of everything. This is located on serene and eastern. try now..
