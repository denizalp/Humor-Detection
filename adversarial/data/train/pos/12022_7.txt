Here we go... It took 26 years, but I finally made my pilgrimage to Heinz Field to see the Steelers play where they (and I) belong. No amount of rain could dampen our spirits as we watched them take on the Bengals and pull out a victory! \n\nIt's always fascinating to venture to different football stadiums to witness traditions and get a real feel for their fanbase. You just can't get it from TV! From the moment we joined the throngs of people making their way from downtown Pittsburgh to Heinz Field, I knew it was going to be ok. \n\nFirst of all, people tailgate on BOATS along the Allegheny River. Not lots of people, but people. That's the dream. If you don't have a car to tailgate at, never fear! There are plenty of parties right outside the stadium at the different bars\/restaurants, or just along the perimeter itself. You can easily find a place to have a few brews without worrying about lacking your own car\/grill. That's nice.\n\nWe made our way inside pretty early and spent an hour just looking at the Hall of Fame, witnessing the pump up party happening at the entrance, viewing warmups on the field, and simply taking it all in. The energy was electric!\n\nIt rained, it poured, and yet, we still had an amazing experience. In terms of concessions, we had slim pickings in our high section, but that's not really what we were here for. We were here to wave our Terrible Towel, to cheer on Big Ben, and to witness a win. From our seats in section 524, we were directly across from the scoreboard, with our sights set on the Heinz Field sign with the river in the background. It was perfect.\n\nI want to go back. I need to go back. I will be back!
