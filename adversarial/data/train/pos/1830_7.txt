Roxy's Diner has been in the Stratosphere for years. \n\nWe have have been here numerous times over the years.\nWe like the vibe of the 50's and the waiters sing which can be fun especially when it is your server doing the singing.. \n\nSometimes it can take a while to get your food if they are very busy but we have always been pretty lucky and either went after a rush or when things calmed down.\nThe food is not bad we have had Breakfast before, sandwiches, and dinner items. \n\nIts great they are open 24 hours there was so many nights we played on the machines for hours and lost track of time and went here because we wanted something fast to eat before heading to the room.\nIts not a bad place to go if you want some Diner food. Its convenient to go to when staying there instead of leaving casino to go find someplace to eat.\n\nCheck it out it is a fun Diner to eat at!
