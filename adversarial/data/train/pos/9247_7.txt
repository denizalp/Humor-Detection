I was already sold when I saw the paper menu listing over 70 pizza choices with varied toppings and saw the tasty looking pizzas waft by on the packed terrace! \n\nPizza was delicious with a great light crust. I had the Renaissance; spinach, mozzarella, tomato sauce and crispy spicy pancetta. The pancetta was fresh, tasty and plentiful and I devoured the entire thing! \n\nWine menu had standard bottles at very reasonable prices.\n\nI can't wait to eat my way through the menu!
