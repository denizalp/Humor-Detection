I had heard so highly about there buffet I was really looking forward to eating here. Definitely misinformed. \n\nGot into vegas late and was hungry, So checked in real quick at the Luxor and headed to PH to eat. My impression of the Buffet of Buffets is could go to the participating buffets, pay and get a card or wrist band. Was told rudely or bothered by an older filipino lady that I had to go up this way and turn that way to get a rewards card to eat there for the deal. All she did was get me lost cause she lead me know where. This security guy helped me find where i was suppose to go in the end, alot easier. So took care of that, went back down, paid and got our table. \n\nI 1st tried the Seafood Station. The fish was pretty good. They had cajun tilapia, crab stuffed sole, panko battered shrimp and beer battered fish. They all had alot of flavor. There so called Paella was dry and lacked taste. Joe's Crab Shacks version is 10x better. \n\nThey had meat, cheese and cracker Station, Mexican and American station but none of it caught my attention.\n\nThe one that did was the Middle Eastern Station. They had kabobs of Tandoori chicken, Beef and Vegetables, Hummus, Babaganoosh, Naan bread and \"AWESOME\" Candied Figs. Couldnt get enough of them and everything else they had to offer. The guy knew what i wanted since i kept going back alot. lolll\n\nThe Desserts......ummmmm sucked. Only thing that tasted good was the Cotton Candy. It would be pretty hard to mess that up lolll\n\nSo needless to say I dont know if I will come back here unless im craving some Middle Eastern food. That was the only \"WIN\" about this place.
