Vegetarian Menu is pretty awesome!\n\nI have always really liked the Terrace Pointe Cafe. I have been dining here during the Summer months for years, and sometimes during the not so warm months if I am at Wynn for an event or a show. The Cafe sits overlooking the Wynn pool and is a nice view when the weather is warm ;)\n\n Here is the thing..it's a cafe. Simple, but elegant in it's styling. Used to be 24 hours, but now only into late night I believe. I have always been a fan. You can get everything from a burger and fries to a Vegetarian menu option of a burger and fries. I have had their 'veggie burger' and fries served with a cashew milk-chocolate shake and really enjoyed it. \n\nit's comfortable, and clean, and the food is made well and tastes good. Sure it's not your most typically priced 24 hour, but you are on a 5 star property and the food is comparable to the price point. That being said, it's usually about $40 each when I have dined at Terrace Point, but we have a few drinks, appetizers, dinner.. it's all good and not too much more than I would spend at any other cafe around Vegas. \n\nTh atmosphere is relaxed with comfortable seating and they have good food and a full bar. For that I'm In! Check it out!
