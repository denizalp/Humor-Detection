Please take note:  I just finished one of the outstanding sandwiches I've ever had.  \n\nAs an omnivore, I know sometimes vegetarian preparations are at a minor disadvantage in some books, not the case here.  The culture is an exceptional sandwich, nothing is missing, everything is right:  tempeh, pesto, the zing of the chipotle aoili, some fresh greens.  \n\nHaving consumed at least 8,000 sandwiches so far in my life, I know what I am talking about.
