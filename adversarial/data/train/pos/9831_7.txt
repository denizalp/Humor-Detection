Opa! \n\nI've been scheming a nice new restaurant to try for a special occasion, and Mamakas was at the top of my list. I've never come across high-end Greek food in Toronto, so I was pretty excited. I love Greek food, I love fancy things, win win. \n\nThe restaurant itself is sparkling white with bright murals and large windows for Ossington people watching, one of my favourite sports. While sitting in this bustling yet pristine setting, we enjoyed their tequila negroni, the tzaziki and pita, the spanikopita, the lamb and the octopus. It was all delicious, especially the tzaziki and lamb. The octopus is huge and means business, so if you're like Neil Patrick Harris* and are into octopus and scrabble, this is probably your dish. The owner sent over a small bottle of ouzo, which really added a kick to our night, and was very appreciated. \n\nPEPPER'S PISSED: Huh. Haven't been pissed in a while, but I need to sound off. What is with this new airplane-sized bathroom trend, Tarana? I'd rather wait for a couple of minutes than be squished into a 2x2 room that houses a sink, toilet, mirror and garbage. \n\n*I just saw Gone Girl.
