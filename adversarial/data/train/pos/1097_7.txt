I'm seriously giving this location 5 stars mainly because this Fremont location IS OPEN!!!!\nI've been eyeballing Harley Davidson locations in Las Vegas on Yelp AND Google and both have mentioned this spot is closed?! WTH.... ok... So, I browsed on line secondary locations to visit while in town.\nFremont location is literally 2 blocks away from the hotel we're staying at....\nSo, while walking Fremont on a Monday night- I spot the iconic Black & Orange sign a few feet away (and inside- my heart did a happy dance).\nWe've made it a tradition to buy HD gear for our special someones in our lives whenever we travel.\nAnd SEEING that this location is OPEN was such a relief.\nSo, obviously- visiting from out of town & not renting a car- this Fremont location worked for us!\nStaff was wonderful, great merchandise to choose from, location can't be beat.
