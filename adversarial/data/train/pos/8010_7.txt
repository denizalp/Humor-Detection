This place is a hole! Coming from a former VS employee, this place sucks in all aspects. \n\nCame here with a group of friends to take advantage of their last day for the 7 for $28 panty sale and was completely dismayed by their store.\n\nPanties were jumbled everywhere on the table, no employees to be seen on the sales floor, their sales rack had clothes tangled and falling apart, random items piled in places they clearly don't belong in. My friends even had to wait for someone to come behind the counter and check them out. Do they not have enough employees? \n\nIt was obvious that they were having a slow day but this place was a mess! I don't understand how that could possibly happen. I used to work at the TS location years ago and we always made it a priority to keep the store clean, busy or not.
