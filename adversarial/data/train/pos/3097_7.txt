\"I worked in a pet store and people would ask how big I would get\"\n--Rodney Dangerfield\n\nYou will have quite the opposite of a Rodney Dangerfield experience at this Pet Club. Here, you will get all the respect! The front half of the store is dedicated to cats, dogs, and a small section devoted to small animals and birds. The other half is devoted to livestock\/horse supplies, including hay (Prices are at the counter, Bermuda and alfalfa offered when I went). The dog section has more of a focus on food and treats, but they did have other items, such as toys, cleaning supplies, harnesses, leashes, and crates.\n\nI came here actually to look for some protective wear for dogs during the summer while walking on hot pavement. Unfortunately they had only one kind of doggie shoes and they were for cold weather but they did have a wide variety of sizes for them for a good price. I ended up browsing through the rest of the store and got some great deals on treats (50% off). They also had good deals on food, both canned and dry. Some brands I remember seeing were Blue Buffalo and Arcana. Unfortunately they didn't have the type of dog food I usually buy for my corgi mix but they had a similar brand which looked interesting.\n\nService was extremely attentive and I was asked several times if I needed anything. I was even greeted and asked if I needed anything by a gentleman (Maybe the manager?) in the office when I walked by. Everyone here was really friendly. \n\nThe store itself makes good use of the space they have. It's not a megamart like Petsmart but they do have a sizable building to house a lot of different items. \n\nIf you sign up to be on their list, they'll also send you some discounts and updates to the store. \n\nI didn't see any live animals for sale here but I did read that sometimes they do get in little chicks which I'd love to see on a future visit. It's one of my dreams to have egg laying chickens for fresh eggs each day! It's probably for the best they didn't have any animals for sale like snakes, you never know what could happen with them:\n\n\"When I was 16... I worked in a pet store. And they fired me because they had three snakes in there, and one day I braided them.\"\n--Steven Wright
