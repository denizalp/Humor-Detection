Now moved to a bigger location, and thank goodness because I've had closets bigger than the space they were in before. \nJokes aside, Lush is a lovely place to get some gifts for some women in your life, or just to treat yourself to a few bath goodies. I do find their products to be way overpriced, but it all depends upon what you like spending your money on. If you don't mind spending a few extra bucks to enjoy a colorful, delicious smelling bath, this is the place to go. I don't really subscribe to all of their views on skincare, and I don't necessarily think using food on your face is the way to go, but there are some products I buy here that I absolutely love using, and will continue to repurchase. Gifts from Lush are also always well received, and a great conversation starter, especially for those that haven't tried their products. \nI haven't always had great service here, mostly because it's usually overcrowded, but I do appreciate that the company focuses on doing good, be it environmentally, through their cruelty free pledge, or through whatever charity promotion they have going on at that time. I trust the brand, and will continue to visit for the unique products and positive company reputation.
