NO. NEVER. SCREW THIS. I CAN'T.\n\nI don't support taxis (have you seen that horrendous youtube video when a taxi driver literally jumped onto an uber during the 2016 protest?!?). I highkey can't deal with the crazy green and orange cabs flying around toronto. When I drive downtown, they always find a way to sneak into my lane, regardless of how close they've come to scraping my car. When I'm walking downtown, there are so many times when I'm almost run over because they're running a yellow or too impatient to stop before they turn right on a red. Sooo much no.\n\nToday was the worst snow storm of toronto all season.. I had to get somewhere at 5:30pm and I finish work at 5:30.. and the storm hit. It was already ROUGH in my mind. Uber was surged, I peeked out the window to see people and cars slipping everywhere. Ugh. My boss recommended I take beck taxi because it's not surged and you can order one to show up anytime. My office is right across eaton's so I was terrified for the driver too, in the storm. \nI'd say I called my taxi, but I couldn't - it's one line and it's BUSY .. it just gives you the beeps, not even a hold message..... I ordered the cab online and it's so shitty.. couldn't track the cab, no service updates.. all it said was \"we'll call you if there's a problem\" and I ordered it to arrive at 5:20pm. At 5:26pm, I'm still sitting at my desk, bundled up.. trying to track down my taxi but no luck with the phone or website.\n\nI ended up ordering an uber at 5:28pm and it came at 5:30pm exactly. \n\nBeck didn't follow up with me until 6:15pm-ish. What...\n\nSo done. Never again.
