I didn't realize at the time of the booking we would be staying in an Italian themed tower, with a French styled restaurant, and that to get to my room I would need to navigate an English inspired maze or to find my chariot again would require 3 elevators. \nRoom was quite nice. Bathroom was very nice. Don't touch anything or they will bill you. I'm glad we paid less than 40% of the normal rate.
