Should be 3.5 but i am bumping it up.\n\nWent there for lunch with my friend. He swears its his 2nd most favorite Mexican food place. So, we went. Real small homely looking joint. WHAT?!? 1c tap beer with any Lunch Special? ($6.75) That is awesome. I had some soup and cheese quesadilla. Both were simple and good. \n\nVery much home cooking there. Not a fancy shamncy stuff but your good down to earth grandma's cooking.\n\nIf you happen to be there, or work there, or drive through that shady neighborhood, i would totally recommend to stop by and try something there. It surely would be worth it.\n\n\"I like\"
