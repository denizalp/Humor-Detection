Veronica is the most rude waitress with some power issues. Very rude to customers.\nWe wanted to purchase a Champaigne bottle for a friend of ours and asked her how much it was. She replied - Why the F do you want to know? Then I looked her name tag so I knew what her name was and she reported us to Robert the security guy here who asked us to leave. I asked him what the reason for that was and he replied - you didn't pay for this Bungalow so I don't have to give you a reason.
