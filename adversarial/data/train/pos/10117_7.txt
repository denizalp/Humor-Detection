I came here for a surgical procedure on Monday of this week.  I was impressed by the friendliness of the staff and the ease of checking in.\n\nWait time was minimal.  In the pre-op room, the nurse was very nice and helpful and before long she wheeled me to the room for the procedure.\n\nI was in and out of there in about 2 and a half hours which was quite good.
