What to say about a group of musicians who make great music and obviously have fun doing so?\n\nWhat I like about the CPO is the huge variety of music they offer. It is not 'classical' only but something for every taste. They do everything from Bach to Strawinski as well as ABBA, The Beatles, film scores like Star Trek, Psycho and The Wizzard of Ozz and a lot more. The orchestra shines brightest when they can do what they do best: classical concerts. \n\nOne of the important things to mention is the \"cpossibilities\" program, which gives young people aged 15 to 29 the chance to experience the CPO for $14 and even buy a second ticket for a guest (friend\/family) for the same price, no matter which age the companion is.\n\nSo take out granny for a concert :)\n\nUpdate 2012\/13 season:\nIn more and more of the 'POP-series' concerts and some of the specials the CPO is only acting as 'background noise' and sometimes they even seem to be ignored by the guests performing in front of them (hey - at least say thank you to the orchestra before you leave the stage guys!). Dear CPO management: a sold out concert house is not everything - keep up quality!
