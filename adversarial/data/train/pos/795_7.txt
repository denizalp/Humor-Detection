Stopped in here for a birthday party with a group of close to 25 people.  A reservation was required for a group of this size.  The space is extremely big with plenty of tables, three llarge bar areas, an outdoor seating area (with fully functioning wood burning fireplace) and plenty of large screen TV's around.  The place is also dog friendly!\n\nThere are plenty of their beers on tap here.  Many different styles as well, IPA's, DIPA's, Pale Ales, Porters, Wheat Beers and seasonal beers (Marzen was on tap when I visited), Pumpkin beer and Stouts (I am sure there were a few more as well).  \n\nThe food menu was fairly standard for a brew pub, but the quality was much better than many places I have been.  Since we were a large party, we had plenty of appetizers lining our table before sitting down for dinner.  The flatbreads and wings were really good, cooked nicely and not overdone, the flavors were spot on.  \n\nDespite being such a large group, the service was spot on.  Quick, efficient and prompt.  No one was ever waiting around for a refill on alcohol and our food came out in a timely manner.  \n\nOverall, this is a great place.  I enjoyed sitting outside as it was a mild evening, but the outside filled up quickly.  Despite the place being so big, it will get crowded and tables\/seats can be harder to come by.  I will definitely visit this place again for sure.
