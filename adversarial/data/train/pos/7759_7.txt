I was referred to  Empire Customs by a friend I ran into at a charity event. I liked the idea because I had got suits previously custom made via Maxwells the travelling tailors from Hong Kong...so I didn't need to be sold on the \"custom\" part. Empire is local and available whenever I need them.So I dropped in before an out of country wedding in June. Service was great, Suit was what I expected (quality) and they had things ready before the promised date. Would go back for sure.
