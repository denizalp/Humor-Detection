Let's get a little heart-felt here... If you want to skip story time, head straight to the ***\n\nFifteen years ago, after years of gear rentals and lessons to prove my commitment, thirteen year old me, with huge support from \"The Bank of Mom & Dad\" bought what would influence my life decisions and help shape my identity until now, and forever: A 1999 Burton Custom from The Source - my first snowboard.\n\nBeing the little fanboy I was, I probably wore my The Source T-Shirt for months on end to convince my dad to that it was worth it skip the stuff from  Sport Mart and buy gear from a REAL snowboard shop like The Source. In hind sight? it TOTALLY was.\n\nThe guys at The Source taught me everything a beginner needed to know about snowboard differences, and what boards worked best for different ability levels and styles of riding.  They hooked me up with a board that I not only loved right away, but that kept up with me as I got older and better. \n\nWell, that was a LONG time ago, what's changed?\n\n***As a now very experienced snowboarder, I went to The Source today, and learned that yes, a LOT has changed in fifteen years - with snowboards that is... but The Source still kicks ass.\n\nEven on a busy boxing day, one of the guys managed to take me on a brief history tour of all the changes that had been made to snowboards since my last one. We talked new camber designs and how they would affect the board's feel.  He then steered me in the direction of several different boards, now drastically different than any I had ridden that he thought would suit my riding style.  I took him up on one of his recommendations and bought myself a new ride.  \n\nEvery product review and all the research I've done online since then has been very reassuring that The Source hooked me up with the best board for me. I can't wait to take it out this weekend for its debut run. I'll let you know if I wind up as impressed with it as I think I will be.
