All the puddy tats were asleep when we went and it was hella hot, but it was pretty cool to see them up close....The Dolphins were also a cool sight to see and you could get up-close and personal with them for a day if you're willing to shell out $500...\n\nAs cool as these animals are, there's nothing like seeing them in their natural surroundings, and free from captivity.....for those of you who've seen The Cove, y'all know where I'm comin' from....ALOHA!!!
