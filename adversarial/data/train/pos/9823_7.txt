Hey you, whining about how Las Vegas has no culture, listen up. Maybe if you took a break from kvetching and watching Dexter you'd notice that there are some dedicated, talented people working their creative bones off to create culture. And, you know what they say: If you're not part of the solution, you're part of the... (problem, in case you don't know what they say).\n\nMarty Walsh at Trifecta Gallery is definitely part of the solution. She always has a quality, thought-provoking exhibition featuring contemporary art from great talent, many of whom are recognized internationally. In addition to the exhibitions, she carries what she describes as \"'little art' for sale in the 'little shop' in our 'little' gallery.\" This \"little art\" ranges from eclectic handbags to donut sculptures. And, if that is not enough, she does an amazing job supporting local artists. Every Winter she hosts the \"Minumental\" show, which features numerous smaller, affordable pieces from local Las Vegas artists just in time for gift-giving season. This is always a fun show. \n\nShe also curates the art at Bar+Bistro, the new restaurant in the space formerly occupied by Paymon's downtown, and it looks fabulous. I have not eaten at the restaurant, but the space is really special. There is even an \"Art Menu\" similar to a \"Wine Menu\" but featuring all of the art on the walls with information and pricing. Too cute.\n\nThe passion is evident at Trifecta. So, get off your couch and go check out some contemporary art.
