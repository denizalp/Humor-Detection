Wake up people, if you are looking for good pizza and you haven't been to Cafe Roma then you better get down there!!  This pizza is cooked by a Sicilian woman for crying out loud!  Average?  Whateva!\n\nThere are a few locations of Cafe Roma, the only other one I have been to is the one in Tempe which was good but not quite the same.  Go to this one, at the AZ Center, order a whole pizza and enjoy.  They have a huge menu and I'm sorry to say that we haven't tried anything else on it because the pizza is so tasty we just cannot resist!!  They serve slices as well, but you know those have been sitting behind the glass for who knows how long and although I'm sure they are good as well, nothing compares to a freshly made pizza.\n\nI'm also not sure what Jonathan B.'s gripe is with waiting so long...we have never waited longer than 10 mins and for a fresh pizza I think thats pretty average.  For around $13 we get a large cheese and 2 drinks.  They also serve beer, wine and other alcohol but not a huge selection and they do have happy hour specials.  They also have two tvs that always have at least one of the local games on.  My only complaint is that they are not open very late (830 I believe) and they don't have their hours posted anywhere.  \n\nThis place was dangerous when I actually lived downtown, I'm glad to be a little up the road now so I'm no longer eating pizza everyday!!  ASU students!  Downtown workers!  Drunk hipsters!  Make your way to Cafe Roma!
