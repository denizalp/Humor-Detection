Topgolf. Is. Spectacular.\n\nI went to a soft opening last Friday and the venue completely exceeded my expectations. Las Vegas has nothing like this and it's going to be such an amazing addition on the strip.\n\nTopgolf is spacious - 4 floors with everything imaginable! There's 5 different bars, 2 pools, live music, delicious food, and of course - golfing. A very unique type of golfing:\n\n- You reserve a hitting bay which has a booth with plenty of seating (can lounge and order food\/drinks here if you're not much of a golfer)\n- Those who want to play hit golf balls on the hitting bay towards a large, open field with multiple targets\n- You earn points depending on where your golf ball lands; various targets on the field, closer to the bullseye (flags) and the farther you hit in distance earns you more points\n- A microchip is in every golf ball so the score is sent virtually to a screen located in your hitting bay\n\nThe top 2 floors are for 21+, however, the overall atmosphere of Topgolf is great for all ages. Kids, teens, and adults can all enjoy themselves at Topgolf! This would be an excellent choice for a family outing - and with the great bars, food, and live music, I definitely can see young adults enjoying a birthday or bachelor\/bachelorette party here. Oh and of course, I know locals like myself will thoroughly enjoy Topgolf... Especially those who enjoy golfing and drinking! \n\nThe service here is the cherry on top. All of the workers, servers, and bartenders were incredibly welcoming, friendly, and attentive during the soft opening. I can't wait for Topgolf to officially open. I was so impressed with everything about this place and have nothing but positive things to say. I can't wait to come back!
