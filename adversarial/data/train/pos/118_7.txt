This place is so lovely! If you want comfort food, this is the place. \nAnd it was restaurant number 8 crossed off my Restaurant resolutions list. \nhttp:\/\/wp.me\/p1t9bx-k0\n\n\nVIBE \nYes, I have to say it. So hipster. It is a long, narrow diner with plenty of booths and stools at the bar. Really funky wallpaper adorns the walls and you can see the cooks working their magic in the back. It's dimlit in here and perfect on a grey or breezy night. Great for a casual date or catch up with a friend. \n\nWE ATE\nWarm bread and olives were comforting and I'm glad we got them because it took a while for our food to come. If you're in a rush, maybe this is not the place for you. \nI had the fried chicken. It's not Stockyards but I gobbled it up! It felt like my grandmother's recipe. Yum and YUM. \nI mistakenly thought Mac and Cheese was on the menu -- only the children's menu. Bring it for the adults! \nMy dining partner had the mussels and fries. I had a fry and they were thick and fresh and lovely. He seemed to enjoy the mussels. It was quite the bowl. Portions are just the right size to fill you up but not leave you stuffed. \nAfter hearing that they had nutella perogies on the menu, we had to try them. What a creative dish! They were delish but they were not \"wow\" and a brown perogie may not be the most visually appealing. That said with some creme fraiche, lovely! \n\nOBLIGATORY CATCHY REMARK \nThe Ace is ace. It seems like a lot of people are going here for brunch. Maybe I'll try it when the crowds die down? This place really does feel like the new Swan.
