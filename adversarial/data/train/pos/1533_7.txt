What's happening to Wynn?\n\nThis place is still a 5-star resort, but my experience was not so great this time.\n\n1. PLEASE DOUBLE CHECK THE BILLS YOU GET FROM THE CASHIER\n- They handed a fake $100 bill.  It felt strange in the hand so I put it to the light and could not find a strip or any signs of a valid $100 bill.  None of the slot machines accepted it either.  Upon bringing this up, the cashier changed it right away.\n\n2. DON'T EXPECT TO WIN HERE\nThe toll on the shareholders is starting to squeeze the players.\nThis casino has really tightened up.\nCraps only allow 2x odds now.  Yes.  $10 limit, double odds.  If you want the usual 3-4-5x, you need to go to a $50 limit craps table.  Craps players know how much of a disadvantage this is for the players that only play pass - come - max odds\nThe slot machines just weren't paying out at all.  I usually get a few machines to pay out, but I couldn't believe how tight these machines were.  I walked around and usually you'll see a few people hitting something big, but this time I saw nobody.  Just quiet slots with an occasional small win sound.\n\n3. Had to wait 30 minutes for checkin\n- The key printing machine had an issue which resulted in everyone waiting in front of the hotel clerk for 30 minutes.  It was 30 minute of \"It should be very soon\" \"this never happened before\"\n\n4. THE SNACKS IN THE FOOD WERE EATEN ON ARRIVAL\n- Yes, check your snacks.  The boxes were open and eaten without it being removed from the tray.  This is not what you'd expect in a 5-star hotel you pay premium for.\n\n5. MAKE SURE YOUR DOOR IS ALWAYS CLOSED \/ Deadbolted\n- A friend once told me someone came in at night and took his money.  According to the front desk, the door was not closed all the way.\n\nOther than those issues, it's a great resort.  One of the nicest on the strip.\n\nI recommend it over Encore.\nThe strip view is better.  The rooms are pretty much the same.  Tub is bigger.  The casino is A LOT bigger.  There is a cafe downstairs while Encore does not.
