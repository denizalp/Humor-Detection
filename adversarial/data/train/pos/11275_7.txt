I love this place!!!!! Im going to go straight to the point and tell you why:\n\n1. The menu is super simple. Just your basic mexican menu: burritos, tacos, salads, quesadillas, all with your choice of meat. Their prices are very reasonable. It's a little pricier than regular fast food, but you're paying for the quality. \n2. Employees are friendly and quick. They make your food right in front of you so you know it's super fresh and you can see what's actually going in your food. There's always someone in the dining area to keep it clean and to make sure that everyone is doing ok.\n3. The actual food is fantastic!! My personal favorite is the chicken salad with house dressing. I get it without cheese and tortilla chip pieces. I figure the tortilla and dressing is enough calories in itself. The lettuce is fresh and crisp. The tortilla is warm and soft. The chicken is moist and flavorful. And their dressing is super addictive. Cilantro-Limey deliciousness!! \n4. They have a stamp card!!!! After 10 stamps, your next meal is free. And it's cute when the cashier rings you up for your free meal, the entire staff yells out \"FREE MEAL!\" Nice touch. \n\nAll in all, I have never been disappointed when eating here. This is a good place to eat if you're health conscious. I recommend this place to everyone!!\n\nP.S. this isn't a big enough reason to bump then down a star, but their guacamole is not good. I've seen it brown before. I just tell them to leave it out when I order.
