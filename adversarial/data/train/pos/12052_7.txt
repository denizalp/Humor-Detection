The play ground is so cool here the kids love playing on all the levels and looking out at the view.\n\nThere's not many swings but plenty of slides of all sizes. The dinosaur play pit is also awesome they can get dirty and play in sand and hide in baby dinosaur eggs! I noticed there were two duck ponds. One pond has a beautiful waterfall and there's benches to sit and duck watch and just enjoy the view. \n\nThere's also a soccer field and that's great for us because my boys love to play soccer! \n\nThe bathrooms were clean and close to the play ground, that was nice to not have to walk a long distance to use the restroom so there was more play time. \n\nThe play ground was gated all around which I loved not having to worry about my little ones running where they should not. In the play area there are picnic benches and couple shaded ones which I wish they were all shaded in this Vegas heat! Over all I enjoyed this park and will be going back
