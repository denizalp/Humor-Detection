cin s. i think we were there the same day because the chippendale with the ponytail and nipple rings, although not the best looking was the best performer, i had my eye on him the whole time.\n\nmy favorite act happened to be the glow in the dark body paint and the 112-anywhere routine, that song brought me back to junior high so of course it was going to be my favorite.\n\nduring the show my mind was racing: cheerleader like moves and body roles what the heck?, buffness oh wow he's handsome, this is ridiculous! then you're laughing your head off, then your screaming \"take it off!\", then your admiring their physique, then your asking yourself \"is that guy gay\"? then you're screaming again.\n\ncome lubed up with alcohol or most of the night you'll be thinking \"are you serious!?\" \n\nthese guys put in serious time in the gym, probably don't eat french fries and get their teeth whitened on a regular basis. so props for doing a great job. \n\ni love the double standard switch, women treating men like meat and guys having to perform and get a reaction from the women in the audience.\n\nonly thing is they don't allow pictures during the show, then again the chippendale's would probably be blinded by the flashes.\n\nstill they charge you $20 each to take a picture with the group after the show, straight hustlerrrrrssss. can't get too mad at that. plus they make the dude with the baby face collect the money. smarrrrrrrrrrt.
