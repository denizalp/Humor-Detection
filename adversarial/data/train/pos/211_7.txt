There was a time when this place was our Go-To destination for steaks in Downtown Scottsdale.\n\nA lot has changed this since. There are so many other options now; but Don & Charlie's still holds a place in our heart for being a good standard of delicious BBQ meats in the area.\n\nWe were celebrating another amazing Year-End and were looking forward to what 2017 had in store for our business; and we opted to dine here after being absent all these years.\n\nFor a weeknight, this place was still humming, and parking could've been dreadful; if it weren't for the availability of valet parking - which we always take advantage of when offered.\n\nWe were famished and didn't really waste any time ordering. Bring on the meat - as we emphatically stated!\n\nFor starters, we had the Tomato Bisque soup. This soup had an amazing consistency about it. It wasn't too tart, but not too watered down either. It could not have been any more perfect than this.\n\nFor the main course, we had the BBQ Chicken, the BBQ Beef Bone, and the Parmesan Crusted Sirloin. All fine examples of the large portions that you receive in this establishment.\n\nAnd that is where I think we trail off in terms of opinions as far as the food here is concerned. Don & Charlie's always prided itself in the immensity of their portions. Their advertisements, and even word of mouth, regarding their portion sizes comes to mind.\n\nThe flavor of the food just doesn't quite distinguish themselves as much as they used to. The Chicken was light and moist, but the flavor was on the bland side. The Beef Bone was saturated in BBQ Sauce, but tasted overdone and the flavors were only skin deep.\n\nThe Sirloin was just okay, and the onion rings were soggy.\n\nDon't get me wrong, it was still a good meal - and definitely still a good value. However, it just doesn't liven up the palate and senses like it used to. \n\nHowever, the Creme Brulee with the Chocolate Center is still one of the best that we have tasted here in the valley.
