I'd never experienced all that is Warehouse One - The Jean Store, and I can honestly tell you that it's been my loss completely.\n\nNot only does Warehouse One carry jeans, jeans and more jeans (go figure), but they carry urban, hip and extremely fashionable wear for ladies and gentlemen alike. \n\nThe service was impeccable from the moment we walked in. Every person in my party (yes, including my two bodyguards) were greeted personally and any questions we had were answered with enthusiasm and professionalism.\n\nWhat I especially loved about this store was their BOGO sale on jeans and in addition to that, they had 50% off racks throughout the store. They carried everything from straight leg, skinny leg, boot cut, low rise, all the way to the boyfriend fit of jeans, and in addition to that, they carried belts, shirts, wallets, purses, scarves, panties and winter jackets (for $50)!\n\nThe store was nice and quiet - I hate crowded stores - and I overheard one of the employees explaining that whenever they get new styles, they put the old styles on sale. \n\nTheir jeans were priced at around $40\/each, plus remember, buy one, get one!\n\nThis store is truly a gem of a store and if you need a hot pair of jeans to accentuate that bootylicious booty - yes, I'm talking to boys and girls alike, it's time you paid these folks a visit.
