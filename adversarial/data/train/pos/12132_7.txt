Rainbow Pho Express has great food, Pho Show!  A relative introduced this place to my wife, Nikki and I.  It's tucked away next to a burger joint, Cheeburger Cheebruger.  Anyhow, when we got inside it was clean and very nice looking.....but, was the food going to add up to our Chinatown staple, Pho Kim Long? \n\nWe started out with coconut juice which was a nice treat.  After slurping down the juice you can eat the coconut meat inside.  My wife and I split the Pho Tai w\/ rare steak and it was a pretty par price of $6.99.  It was delicious!  Nikki's uncle got the No. 38 Com Dia which was $9.99.  For the price it was a really good deal.  Kind of a combination plate with 1 marinated beef bbq stick, grilled shrimp stick, egg roll, fried rice, noodles, salad, and a mini pho soup.  I think I'm going to have to get that next time.  I tried a couple pieces of the marinated beef and it was sooooo good.  \n\nHowever, the service needed some work.  Are server was attentive and was really pleasant.  However, at the end of our meal Nikki's uncle notice on the check that they did not charge us for the coconut juice.  Being the good samaritan he is, he told them.  They ended up charging us $15 total for all 3!  We asked them why.  Because on the menu it said they were $2.50 each ($7.50 for 3).  They said that there were two different kinds: juice in the can $2.50 and juice in the coconut $3.50.  But, even if we paid the $3.50 they were over charging us.  Anyhow, they felt bad and explained there were discrepancies in the menu.  I think they have discrepancies in their math.  \n\nI would give Rainbow Pho Express a 5 for their food!  It was so good that I wanted to go back the next day.  But, their service brought it down a couple notches.  I would say that from my first visit I would rate this place a 3.  I'll change my review after a couple more time and I wish the best for this business!
