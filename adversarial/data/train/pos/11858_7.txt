Our first night in Vegas, we arrived quite late at night and by the time we checked in our hotel and got settled,  we were beyond hungry. I scoured Yelp, as usual, and came across a host of restaurants in our hotel. You know that saying, \"pictures are worth a thousand words?\" Well that quote isn't entirely true because a few choice words could have easily summarized the taste of this pizza. Salty and rubbery. \n\nI blame the photos because we were suckered into getting a large slice of this gigantic pizza thinking it would be good. Coming from NY state we have a lot of great pizza and Pin up pizza couldn't hold a candle stick the the real stuff. Although this pizza is massive, it tastes super salty and gross. These days carbs are far and few between, so when we get a chance to indulge, it better be well worth the treat. There are way too many better places to dine on the strip to settle for this.
