This Sunday after a great party on the Cool Bus the night before, we took the kids to see a flick. \n\n-No line getting in \n-2 min wait at concessions \n-Awesome job buttering the hot and fresh popcorn \n-Ice cold Dr Pepper even if my buds were not tasting it correctly ~ why does that happen after a night of drinking heavily? \n-Clean, comfortable, seats \n-Nice picture and sound but the previews are always louder (the way it should be) then the flick itself. TURN IT UP! \n\nThe whole Norterra complex is getting more and more places to be and see. It can be worth the drive.
