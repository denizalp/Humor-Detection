First, I'm going to start by telling you I'm a huge P&S fan.\n3 stars is horrendous coming from a so proclaimed \"huge fan.\"\nI love the Marda Loop location, and I love that they do a Holt pop up so I can have them while I work too. \nBut on a few recent visits to the Chinook location, I've been rethinking about this love affair. Let's break down the points:\n-I have yet to have a stellar cup of coffee that didn't taste.........burnt.\n-I appreciate the time the barista takes to make a latte leaf.....but in the rush of things it usually looks like the abstract version of the norm.\n-They are constantly out of grilled cheese around dinner time.\n-Why serve salad if it's going to be one bite worth, crammed in a ketchup cup?\n-Why is the front cash girl so grumpy? (Maybe this is specific to me, maybe she hates me). \n\nOne thing that is completely out of their control: STROLLERS. omg it's crowded enough as it is in that small space, why are there so many strollers?! Getting nipped in the ankle by some angry mother is bad enough as it is, it's like this place is a trap for angry moms to take their anger out on people. \n\nI will endorse the business philosophy and the ideological vessel that makes this business a great success, but I really can't deal with another visit to this location. Too much disappointment here.\n\nReview #2 of Yelp's 30 Day Challenge 2012
