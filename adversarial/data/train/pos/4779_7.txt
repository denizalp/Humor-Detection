Pancho, Pancho, you're the man. You make a churro like no one can!\n\nFresh churros filled with the topping of your choice; as long as your choice is chocolate, strawberry, or caramel. Aside from churros, they have a range of baked goods. They don't have a menu or labels on said baked goods so you'll have to ask what some of them are if you're not familiar with the items displayed. They also do some hot drinks to go with your tasty carb-tastic dessert.
