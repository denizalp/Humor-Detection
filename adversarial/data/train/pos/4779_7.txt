Since I stayed at the Hampton Inn, I decided to grab a quick lunch next door at Perkins. Boy, was this a mistake. Let me explain:\n\n1. This place does not offer vegetarian-friendly lunch options. I ended up getting the tomato basil soup and the wedge salad without the bacon. Both were subpar.\n2. The service staff showed little effort. After my waitress carelessly placed the water on my table, she just threw my straw in front of me and hurriedly proceeded to serve the neighboring table. Wow. What's more is that my wedge salad was hastily assembled--the iceberg lettuce was stacked in chunks and the bleu cheese was piled on one side. \n3. The booth I sat at was not well-cleaned, and the table was sticky. How the heck this happened is beyond me.\n\nThe only thing holding me back from giving them 1 star is that their pastries at the front counter look well made. Sorry, Perkins. You're never seeing me again.
