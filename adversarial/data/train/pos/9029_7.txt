For March's International Supper Club UYE, we went lookin for a lil luck of the Irish and headed on down to Casey's Moore's Oyster House. I liked the feel and the look of the place, very woody, felt like it could be a pub in Dublin.  \n\nWe arrived around 6:30 and our server let us know it was Happy Hour till 7 and that all apps were  1\/2 off, so after checking out the app menu I went with the potato skins. They were potato halves stuffed with green chilies topped with melted cheese, chives and bacon with a side of ranch. These were good tasting potato skins!\n\nAfter checking out the menu I went with Casey's homemade Crab Cakes, sometimes I crave crab cakes, it's crazy I know.  These crab cakes are handmade and severed with fried served with homemade chipotle remoulade. I wasn't that impressed with the crab cakes, to me they were over fried, and the chipotle remoulade just tasted greasy.  Maybe the kitchen was having a bad nice because some of the other dishes that came out where not that great either. Or maybe this is the place to hit for Happy Hour drinks & Apps?\n\nOur serve was great, even though it stated on the menu 1 check per table, he gave us all separate checks. I thought that was nice of him to do.
