My girlfriend and I walked into this pub after Zips was packed on a Sunday afternoon.  We were starving and didn't want to drive anywhere else so we figured we'd try Clancy's.  This was our first mistake.  Strip mall bar is complement for this dump.  The projector TV on the wall was faded, barely visible, and of course the one TV with the Cardinals game on was back under it's dingy bar so it was barely visible.  \n\nFood:  We ordered the Hot Wings, Pepper Jack Burger, and for an appetizer Chips, Salsa, and Guacamole.  All of these bar munchies are basically impossible to screw up by anyone not drooling on themselves or riding a short bus yet this place managed to ruin all three.  The wings seemed like they were microwaved and barely had any sauce on them.  The burger showed up with meat, cheese, and a bun.  I was graciously provided rubbery pickles but apparently lettuce and tomato aren't grown in this section of Scottsdale as they were noticably missing.  But lets get to the best part...the guacamole.  To say this stuff was brown and disgusting would be an insult to the Coach Purses and Skin of the Scottdale women everywhere.  This wasn't just a dusting of top that could be scraped off but was through and through this deliciously looking turd treat.   \n\nNeedless to say I'll never return to this culinary hell hole unless I lose a bet that will benefit special need puppies.
