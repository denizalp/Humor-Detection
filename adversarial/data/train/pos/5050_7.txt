I was teeter-tottering between giving this place 3 and 4 stars, but i'll go ahead and give it 4, as if my review will ever be read or even matters to anybody. With that being said, i enjoy writing these worthless little reviews, so even if no one reads this i STILL win. BOOM. Light was fun!!! I got on the Chris Hornack guest list and successfully got in for free. Was in line for 30 minutes and was raging by 11:00 PM. The drinks were shamefully overpriced, the Cirque du Soleil acts were impressive, the dance floor was way too small, the carpet was sticky... and i mean really sticky. We came to see Krewella and they did NOT disappoint. I had this strange feeling that a large portion of Light's clientele was on drugs, which is never a real comforting feeling and with that being said (not to sound judgey) but the people this club attracts weren't necessarily the type of people i tend to be good friends with. They were the fist pumping, heavily intoxicated, quickly-snatch-up-a-girl-to-bring-back-to-the-hotel-room 'type' of people. Whatever, like i said i'm not judging. Regardless, it's easy to have a good time here and was well worth the time spent.\n\n*To the girl i sneezed on... i apologize. The dirty look and rude comment to my date was unnecessary but i understand where it came from. I did in fact cover my mouth, but you still got hit with it and for that i truly am sorry.
