I was very impressed with Haines & Krieger.  I met with 5 other law firms regarding my questions about Chapter 7 vs Chapter 13 bankruptcy, and I felt more comfortable with Haines & Krieger above all else.  They are busy right now, due to the large number of bankruptcy cases, but the process is smooth and comfortable.  Highly recommended.
