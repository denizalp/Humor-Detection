Smelled like sewage right when I walked in the door. The chicken breasts were cut in half...horizontally. The wings look like they were torn from the chicken. The butchering skills of the staff are obviously horrible. The chicken was dry and did not taste good.  The chicken was so small it looked like a pigeon. 8 pcs for $20 = 4 ozs of meat.
