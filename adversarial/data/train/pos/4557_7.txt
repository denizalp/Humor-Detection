Worst adult pool experience ever. I came with 4 girls and 2 guys. We found an area to set up on the chairs & then the waitress took our drink order. Then a guy came up to us and said the chairs are $100 a piece! And that there was no chairs for free, we would have to be in the water basically. I looked around and 80% of the lounge chairs were empty so I was very confused. We made our way down to the small water area. No waitress came, so we walked up to the bar. I was topless & the bartender wouldn't serve me because I was topless. Umm isn't it a fucking topless pool?!? I was so frustrated. This was getting ridiculous. My other friend ordered drinks and food. One drink was a Virginia daiquiri & she paid almost $20ish for it. She got the drink and it reeked of alcohol. She told her she wanted it non-alcoholic so she remade it & said she doesn't know how to do a refund. Smh.\nThis place was full of rules and stuck up staff. Not a fun place or chill place to hang out. Your better off going to a different venue.
