I had a great experience buying a car from Arrowhead Lexus. They were honest about their prices and didn't pressure me into purchasing additional warranties or gap. My salesman was Dave and he was extremely patient with me and didn't make me feel rushed even though we were there after the dealership closed. I would recommend this dealership to anyone.
