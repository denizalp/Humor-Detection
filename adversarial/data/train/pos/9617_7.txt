***************************** 1427 ***************************\n\n   We worked with NACS conference and The Party At NACS 2015 was held here (http:\/\/www.thepartyatnacs.com\/). The main floor looks a little bit runs down but the suites are well kept. The venue is bigger than it seems. With 7 suites upstairs on the second and third floor. Private rooms, bars, and bathrooms are convenient for artists and the entourage to be together. It was about 2,000 of us, and we had plenty of space, comfortable with about 300 people on the dance floor. Easy access in and out of the venue, good security, well organized event. \n\n  Chef Todd English was the guest chef to cook us a 10 courses nice sit-down dinner. Artists performed this year was Darius Rucker, Brett Michaels, Yellow Brick Road, and Flo Rida. \n\n   The Party at NACS has partnered with the Rex Griswold Foundation and Lou Ruvo Center for Brain Health to Fuel the Fight against Multiple System Atrophy (MSA) - a fatal degenerative neurological disorder currently affecting a few of our own. There is no treatment. \n\n   This year, the biggest musical event of the NACS Show week is raising awareness about MSA and funds to accelerate research toward a cure - in support of the strength of those currently fighting, like Tom Gillard (Tropicana, QTG, MetRX) and Rex Griswold (Nestl√© Waters Vice President Strategy C-Store & Food Service) and, in memory of those like Rock 'N' Roll Chef Kerry Simon whose strength and spirit will always inspire us to do more to fight this horrible disease.\n\n  The service was great. Especially on the second floor with a private bartender in our suite, Precious Pat, he was amazing took care of our group and control the bar and Meet & Greet with Flo Rida. Our company and partner Celsius Drinks and D3M Licensing Group, we did an amazing job. When Flo Rida performed, the crowd when nut. \n\n   The sound systems were very good and so the lightings. Good time had by all. \n\n   You can see the party pictures here: http:\/\/nacsvipparty.phanfare.com\/
