My experience here as I go occasionally and play soccer, I haven't dealt with any customer service or admin, which seems to be the main issue here.\nBut as a field, it's pretty good, spacious, air conditioned, well kept and maintained!\nI like this place, been going here for a while, and will continue to go there. Price also isn't expensive
