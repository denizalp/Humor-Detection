Sat outside with a slice of the Margarita. My son had a slice of the \"Bamm-Bamm\"....salami, mushroom and sliced tomato. \n\nGreat feel, great location and stunning pizza. \n\nThe margarita was lively, fresh, tasty, tomato-ey with fresh basil and balsamic drizzle, 10\/10. \n\nThe report of the Bamm-Bamm was \"best I've had in some time\". This is a guy that eats a lot of pizza. \n\nThey take cash only and I didn't ask about delivery. \n\nI'll be back!
