The pupusas revueltas here are so freaking good. Like, so good that I don't order anything else. Grab two for under $5 and that's a meal. Try to have the patience to let them cool so you can consume them without burning your fingertips and tongue, but if you can't, I understand.\n\nTiny restaurant is situated in a busy lot, but the cozy interior and friendly staff more than make up for any minor parking inconveniences. Prices are low, food is fresh. Fellow diners recommend the soups and grilled meats (specifically the steak\/shrimp plates?), similar to other centro-Americo style spots.\n\nBut the pupusas are the best thing here, and the revueltas are the best of them. A tiny bit greasy, but thick with filling and such great flavor. I'm tempted to go get some right now...
