***************************** 1358 ***************************\n\n   We came here before the RUSH concert show last week. Surprisingly on a Saturday night and the place wasn't even full. We got seated promptly. It's a beautiful and modern decor, right next to the 3 Michelin Star Joel Robuchon. It's been a while since I last visited here. L'Atelier de Joël Robuchon surely lived up to what I remember. \n\n   Steve Benjamin, executive chef of L'Atelier de Joel Robuchon did a great job this past few years here. In 2003, he was a part of the opening team of L'Atelier in Paris. When he started, he had 22 cooks and after one week decreased to 8 cooks. I got chat with chef a little bit. He told us the the first thing when he walks into his kitchen is look at the floor. He learned that from Chef Joel Robuchon. \"If the floor is spotless, it means that everyone is working correctly.\" Chef Benjamin said.\n\n   When his kitchen does prep in the morning, he samples everything from the mussels to the foie gras. \"I can be strict at times, but a great team needs a great leader. I learned that from Mr. Robuchon, too.\" he said.\n\n We got to try just about everything on the menu this trip, with my clients, and 2 good friends Vegas local. Everything was perfect, including the wines, the Sommelier did a great job on helping us pairing the wines.\n\n- Maine lobster salad with a sherry vinegar dressing\n\n- \"Ibérico de Bellota\" ham with toasted tomato bread\n\n- Soy glazed kampachi with an endive salad and light mustard dressing - delicious\n\n- Sea bass with simmered baby vegetables, red curry and coconut milk sauce - so tasty\n\n- Traditionally poached chilled duck foie gras - what not to love\n\n- Cod, confit with poached eggplant in a dashi broth, wild mushrooms\n\n- Foie gras stuffed free-range quail with mashed potatoes - this dish was to die for\n\n- Langoustine a la plancha with green curry and cilantro - i can eat this dish every day! \n\n- Veal sweetbread with fresh laurel and stuffed romaine lettuce - richness and full of flavor. \n\n- French style hanger steak with roasted shallot and shishito pepper\n\n- Wagyu beef ribeye with grilled peppers \n\n- The infamous dish - Potato puree - it was buttery, smooth, and screamy on your tongue, simply delicious\n\nDESSERTS:\n\n- .Fresh raspberry surprise inside white chocolate sphere, yuzu ice cream\n\n-  Panna cotta topped with corn ice cream, fresh citrus salad\n\n- Chocolate sensation, \"crémeux\" Araguani, Oreo cookie crumbs\n\n   Service was on point. We could barely moved after the dinner, slowly walked off to the MGM Garden Arena to RUSH concert. the rock & roll music was blasting, and I could barely kept my eyes open. Food coma for the richness and deliciousness of the dinner. \n\n   L'Atelier de Joël Robuchon is a perfect spot for fine dining in a casual space, and plenty a la carte options for you to choose from as well as vegetarian menu. It's a perfect spot for pre-show dinner.
