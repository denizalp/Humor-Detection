Really poor service. It took way to long to get our drinks, foods, and checks and it wasn't even crowded. The food was greasy and clearly not well made.\n\nHonestly, it gets worst.\nWe were seated in a booth by the kitchen, and it smelled disgusting. On top of that, the booth was too high off of the ground and I was wearing a cashmere sweater and I had to lean forward so much that my back ached, and combined with the incredibly long wait, my elbows started to burn because the cashmere was creating a rash from learning over so much.\n\nAlso my legs began to ache because they were disproportional to the ground.\n\nI feel like crying.
