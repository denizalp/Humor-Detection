Great service. Had the pork souvlaki in a bun with tzatziki sauce. Loved the tzatziki but the pork while nicely charred and tasty some parts were slightly underdone. But an issue was that the pork for the dinner and bun were the same siZe. Making it bloody difficult and useless to have in a bun. The raw onions and tomatoes not exactly the ideal combination on it I feel though. \n\nThe banquet burger was quite nice no issues there, but the fries were dreadful. Not crispy at the least and didn't have a fresh feel to them. \n\nGonna try the chicken dinner souvlaki next time.
