Disclosure: Men may not want to read. \nJust received my shipment today of all natural hormone therapy vitamins. I first found these vitamins through a friends recommendation at \"Whole Foods\". I thought heck for all natural and $20 dollars it's worth a shot. Well needless to say I have been on them for three months now and love them. \n\nFor years doctor's have said I need a prescription hormone replacement to balance myself out. NO way, I do not like drugs other than wine.....hee hee \nSo I decided to see if I could purchase them cheaper without having to run over to Whole Foods all the time. I found this website and yes they are much cheaper and more convenient. \n\nIt is a great website they carry vitamins, herbs, beauty products, sports, organic, nutritional items, sexual health, homeopathy, etc....such a great selection. They also have one price shipping for $4.99, which is awesome because this allows me to order a few month's supply making it much less expensive then purchasing from the store. Vitacost.com truly offers wholesale prices on thousands of vitamins, supplements and over-the-counter products. Most of the products they carry are sold at the Published Wholesale Price which is typically 33% to 75% less than what you would pay at the retail level. They also offer auto ship, which is very nice.\n\nThey have a clearance section and run promotions all the time once you order with them. The vitamins I am taking have really balanced me out naturally, no more major hot flashes, oh and they help you sleep like a baby. The shipping is fast and the Customer Service department is excellent. \n\nWould highly recommend this website.
