The hotel was clean, staff was friendly, but the walls were so thin that we could hear the conversation in the next room. It wouldn't have been so bad, but the conversation was nonstop from 3 to 6 am. At about 3:30 am I called the front desk three times before he finally answered the phone. We explained the noise was keeping us awake and asked if he could do anything about it. He said he would come up and take care of it. I doubt if he even came up, because the noise level never let up until just after our alarm went off at 6 am. Never again will we stay in this hotel and we will warn all of our friends who visit to stay away from this poorly built hotel.
