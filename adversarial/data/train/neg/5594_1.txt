AHS Warranty company had first sent AR and the technician blamed my problem (the ac not running) on MPower - the NV service I have. Well, when NV Energy came out, it was a crossed wire on the a\/c unit and said that ANY novice tech would have found the problem! The AR tech didn't even open the unit!  NV Energy fixed it at no cost and I paid AR a $75 service fee for nothing.\n\nJust this Tuesday, the a\/c quit working and it smelled like something was burning! It tripped the breaker and when I turned the breaker back on, it ran for about 2 minutes, but the burning smell got worse. Requested service from AHS online and they were going to send back AR -- I called and told them to FORGET IT and I wanted a reliable company to come and wanted it expedited as I was very sick. AHS was very accommodating and didn't charge me another $75 service fee as it was still in the service call timeframe of it supposed to be working correctly.\n\nLong story short:  Zach and the OWNER, Eric came out EARLY in the morning on their daily schedule, and it was diagnosed in less than 20 minutes and the wiring was wrong, the bearings in the fan were shot, and the condenser was what had burned up. They showed me everything. Very honest, extremely professional and so fast. They even expedited things with AHS, and by Wednesday afternoon I had a\/c again. I am so impressed with their diagnostic and repair service and the fact that they put things through so fast for me. \n\nIF YOU WANT GOOD SERVICE --- CALL DOCTOR COOL! - no upselling, no pressure to sign a maintenance contract - just good people. Not to mention that Eric, the owner,  looks and sounds like Tim Allen...lol -- Tim The Tool Man! \n\nGreat job, Doctor Cool!
