It is my pleasure to tell you Wessin International is one of my favorites. The staff is warm, friendly, and very accommodating. The menu offers the usual wonderful Mediterranean standards with a wide variety of fresh and tasty sides. Try the chutneys made in house to add a little spice to your meal. The popularity of Wessin International is clearly evident by the large following of regulars who frequent the restaurant for lunch and dinner. My favorite feature of this restaurant is the variety of specials prepared daily. For example, I tried the Egyptian staple, Molokhia. Not only was this dish tasty and nutritious, but I gained valuable insight into Wessin International's commitment to healthy and superbly flavored Mediterranean and indeed international presentations. Visit Wessin International. You will enjoy your experience.
