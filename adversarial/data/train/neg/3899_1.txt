I am obsessed with Pop! I haven't ordered anything but the coke with cherry and vanilla cream the 3xs I have been because it is my perfection in a cup! The service has been phenomenal, every time I have gone someone different had taken my order and they've all been exceptional! I especially love pop because I am a nanny and it is close to my job! My 2.5 year old that I nanny is obsessed with popcorn! So stopping by today and using their drive up parking spots where they came out and take your order was a total lifesaver! We'll definitely be stopping by all summer!
