Along with Wild Willy's out in the West Island, Bilboquet in Outremont and Meu Meu on St. Denis, one of the best ice cream parlours in Montreal.\nWith unique one-of-a-kind flavours made from scratch including Chai, Ginger, Green tea, Halva (or Helva or Halwa depending on what part of the Islamic world you come from) and the best, most to die-for flavour of all, Khulfi, Ripples has originality down to an art-form.\n\nThe Khulfi flavour is based on a traditional Indian ice cream made with heavy cream, pistachios, crushed cardamon pods and saffron - once you try this, you'll never go back to vanilla! Halva is a Middle-Eastern sweet, usually made from semolina and can be sweetened with rose water and nuts.\nRipples is only open part of the year, during the summer months so go while you can!
