Stopped in for a sandwich on a late Monday afternoon and sat in the dining room. It just happened to be a seahawks viewing party. Strange lot. Anyway...following the server's suggestion I had the 'Philly Cheesesteak'. The best description would be a hot beef sandwich with steamed onions and peppers all it lacked was gravy. Way far from a Philly cheesesteak. The meat, although tasty, was too thick and in big slices that was soaking in some kind of au jus. The beer (Sam Adams Oktoberfest) was ice cold and the fries were hot and crisp. The service was beginning to slow as the wacked out fans started to arrive. But that was to be expected. My next trip will include nachos which I noticed was the most popular dish coming out of the kitchen.
