Well, I have never been in such a pinch in my life. Less than 12 hours before we were due to leave.. the rug pulled out from under our feet. The flights we had booked to get to Vegas are cancelled and we are left to our own devices to find a way there.\n\nMuch debate and a lot of internet searches later.. we find a \"cheap\" $1600 package that will see us get to Las Vegas.. but as a 'punishment' for going there, the flight path will take us to San Francisco before heading back to Newark and then home.\n\nThat's fine and the site was relatively seemless in it's booking process.. the reason I took away two stars.. \n\nThey booked us stand-by on a flight Denver to Vegas. No mention of that in the booking.. no warning.. just our luck that we did get a seat on full flight in spite of this news.
