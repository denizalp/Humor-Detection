WOW! What a place!\nI have been to many Crepe places in Vegas here. And even one close by my home made by some French people on Durango. But you don't need to be French, to know how to really make a Tasty Crepe. I am from the Chicago MidWest, where good food is on every corner. Just like in France or Italy. And this place could fit in just perfect. I love the Avocado Shakes, and Blueberry Stacked and Stuffed Crepes! WOW! And Fresh made, right on the grill. If you ever been to very fancy Crepe places in Southern France. This is just like them. I am a return customer here now for 4 years. And will only pick here for my Crepes. The owners serve you and are a very nice team. Thank you for the best Crepes, and Avocado Shakes.
