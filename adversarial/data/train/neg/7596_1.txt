Came in Saturday afternoon about 7:30 p.m. to get a baconator combination and Chilli Nachos this was a very sad experience, the fries where served cold and the baconator was a laugh.  I really don't know how you would name a hamburger a baconator which should mean you will get a lot of beacon but no you get to very thin pieces of hamburger, two very thin pieces of cheese and then you get 6 very thin pieces of three inch beacon that you can see through. Come on Wendy's at lease change the name because this is false advertising and at lease change the bulbs on your heating bins. I will go to Mcdonalds fries are a lot better.
