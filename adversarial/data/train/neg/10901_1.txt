By far the worst customer service I have received from any Dunkin' Donuts location. I couldn't even order my top two favorite donut flavors because they were so limited with what they had left. I also ordered a small drink and she ended up charging me for a medium drink when I got to the window. This is my third time having issues with this location. Never again.
