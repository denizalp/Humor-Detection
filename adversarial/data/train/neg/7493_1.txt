John from Dr Cool just came to service our AC units.  He was quick and to the point. Very knowledgeable about what the problem was and was able to fix it fast.  Carla (who works in the office) also offers great and friendly customer service over the phone. Our home warranty company sent them out but I would definitely call them on my own and recommend them to anyone.
