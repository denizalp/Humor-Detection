I have seen a lot of shows here in Vegas and I almost split my gut during this one!  Jeff is very talented and knows how to get the audience involved to have a good time.  My kids loved his show and even got to meet Jeff afterward.  My kids are 8, 5, and 3 yrs old and couldnt wait to start juggling when they got home.  I hope everyone gets the chance to see this show.  Seriously GO.  Like right now.
