If I could give this place no stars I would. Got there at 730 waited Behind one guy for 20 minutes while they took their sweet time getting one item cooked. There were about 5 people working. Only one girl serving\/cashiering (who was SO rude) me and my friend ordered, she had to wait 30 minutes to get her orange chicken. While everyone else was served. When the orange chicken was ready EVERYONE ELSE WAS SERVED THE ORANGE CHICKEN FIRST. While we waited 30 min for it! They forgot about us, THEN there was a SCORPION ON THE FLOOR AND THE CASHIER SAID THATS NORMAL?!?!!! Wow this place needs to be shut down or have corporate fire people and get an exterminator out there! NEVER going back there again. Everyone working was rude and slow and heck.
