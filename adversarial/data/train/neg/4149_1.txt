Canadian tire is the worst place you will get to buy a bicycle. Once you buy a bike there, never coming back there. No matter how long the guarantee is. The repair and maintenance department in this company is nothing but stealing your money and destroying your bike by unbelievable stupid and dumb dumb the way they working on your bike. I bought my first time endurance $415.00 bike on July 14. Since then I've been back and forth 7 times without any clear result of my bike's problem. Starting of the pedal, the back tire, the gear making sounds when the bike in motion, etc etc.  The staff also have no clues at all when I give them a bunch of question about my endless problem from my bike. \nThe bottom line is AVOID CANADIAN TIRE when you needed anything for your life. Their customer service is sinking like Titanic. My experiences in Canadian tire overall is my worst night mare. Very fucked up place in Canada. Completely unbelievable.
