Execellent service very friendly and polite I will go and eat there again when Im in my town.  So we decided to eat here cause of all the good reviews .  I don't regret eating the delicious country fried steak and sunny side eggs. The country fried steak was homemade it wasn't a frozen steak . Also if you want to eat some delicious pancakes well made with scramble eggs cause that's what my wife recommends.
