we used a groupon, we could not justify the cost without it. we watch our money and don't  eat out expensively.\n\nbut we like trying new things, especially if they are authenticate, which i'm sure this was.\n\nit wasn't busy, just after noon on saturday. the owner was business like even though he knew he wasn't going to make a lot of money with such cheap people.\n\nthe pizza was very new to me, apparently wood fired oven, very thin crust, very little tomato, very little cheese, eggplant and other vegies. i liked the flavor, but i'm large and the pizza was small. i've obviously adapted to american style food- lots of mass, little in taste.\n\ni'd love to be able to cook at home like this. i'm going to try. maybe that is the best thing to happen there, i'd like to cook like he did.\n\nthank you to the owner for running the groupon, i hope residents can discover his authenticate taste with them and return. for us it was a major splurge.\n\nnice sangria. glad driver limited to very little. too sweet to taste alcohol content.
