First impression: it's hot af out here and security really makes an effort to get the line moving as slow as they possibly can.\n\nSecond impression: wow did they just charge my guy friend $175 to get in (I get it, the Chainsmokers were playing, but really)?\n\nThird impression: the girls are hot but the bartender made a mistake on my drink order when it wasn't busy and made a huge show of dumping it out and remaking it.\n\nFinal impression: wow they let literally a thousand people in here for the Chainsmokers and it's so crowded it took me literally 20 minutes to find my way out of the middle of the pool.
