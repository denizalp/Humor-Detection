I'd been here years ago, and it hasn't changed. Diner food, with a healthy twist. \n\nThe building is cool, but we sat outside. Service was great for our large group at a busy time. Baby-friendly, which is always nice. I had a GBLT, a very good BLT with guacamole. Good bun, good bacon, fresh veggies. Sided with a very good coleslaw.\n\nSweetie had a Cobb salad, which she really liked. We would definitely go back.
