This place makes delicious food! I've been to quite a few Lebanese \/ Middle Eastern restaurants as I love this type of food, and this place is a place I would recommend checking out.\n\nAt this restaurant in particular they make excellent kafta, their hummus rocks, and even their fatoush salad had a fabulous taste to it.\n\nThe people working there are even super nice!\n\nHighly recommend this place:)
