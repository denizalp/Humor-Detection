Highly highly recommend! First class EVERYTHING. Great, charming chic city hotel conveniently located to everywhere you want to be in the heart of the city. The event staff is superb, the spaces they've created around the hotel for meetings, relaxing, dining are superb. I always look forward to coming back and bringing my friends from out of town, even just for drinks. Just what our city needs! : )
