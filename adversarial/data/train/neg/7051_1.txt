I found Four Paws on YELP!  I took my dog Stella to the day care and I boarded her here when I went out of town.  She loved Four Paws.  She would get so excited when we pulled up and was a happy dog when I picked her up.  You could tell she had fun.  Leslie and Miranda and the entire staff are amazing, genuine and kind.  On two separate occasions I had family emergencies, once had to board my dog without notice and the other time had to extend Stella's stay for longer than I had planned.  Leslie and Miranda gave me peace of mind and it was not a problem in either case.  If you are looking for a safe and caring place to take your dog.  This is it.  Highly recommend.
