Wednesday, January 15, we had a reservation at our favorite restaurant to celebrate our 20th wedding anniversary.  We were so right when we booked our reservation at Vaccaro's.  We requested to have our favorite waiter, Bill.  Bill was amazing.  He had the table set up especially nice for us - chair covers, special candle he purchased and a card from him too!  We felt like royalty.  We decided to do the 4 course wine tasting menu.  Chef Dick came out to talk to us at the beginning of our meal to discuss our likes\/dislikes and also to tell us he'd be doing 5 courses instead of 4.  He was going to start us out with a cheese course to nibble.  Raphael carefully chose each wine to accompany each course and they were all perfect.  The cheese course was wonderful.  This was a special treat for us since our trip to France this year where we learned a lot about cheese.  Then came our appetizer course, scallops with pork belly, a very unique dish  - and I know I'm not describing it properly, but let me just say - AMAZING!  The salad course was just as unique.  It had oats and dried cranberries and was just so refreshing.  Our main course was exceptionally special as they served us Kobe beef with double baked potatoes (the best I think I've ever had) and asparagus.  Dessert was a trio of desserts: italian donuts (my husband's favorite), tiramisu, and creme brûlée on steroids!  We especially need to send a huge shout out to Bill, because he was instrumental in making sure our dining experience was over the top, to Chef Dick for such an amazing meal and to Raphael who even danced at our table!  Thank you Vaccaro's for making our special night even more special!
