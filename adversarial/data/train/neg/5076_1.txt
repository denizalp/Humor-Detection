This is an older theater located inside the suncoast casino (duh). It seems clean, the theaters are a decent size and you have the stadium seating, the three most important things. Since it's not a particularly trendy theater it has the advantage of being pretty much teenager free, which is always a big plus. \nPopcorn, sadly, was a little stale. Sad.\nIt's pretty generic, with old faded carpets and not a lot of business, but it gets the job done very well, and it's slightly cheaper than some of the newer theaters. I'm sure I'll be back.
