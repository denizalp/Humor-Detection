I made an appointment with Tonya to have my a\/c repaired with Arizona Dukes of Air because the fan wasn't turning on my unit. Made the appointment for Monday at 7am. Robert called me and told me he would be by at 7:15. At 7:15, the orange van pulled up and I showed Robert where the unit was and told him the problem. In a couple of minutes he told me that my capacitor was bad. He installed a new dual capacitor which will help minimize any further problems. And it was less than I expected to pay. Took him less than 45 minutes from when he arrived to when he left and most of that time was gabbing about living in Orange County. (He's originally from there like I am) Robert was a cool guy and if you need your a\/c worked on, give Arizona Dukes of Air a call.
