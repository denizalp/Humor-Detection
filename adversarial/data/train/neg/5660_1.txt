Have had their mac n cheese for lunch a few times and just tried their daily soup, that was tomato based and creamy and their grilled cheese sandwich was so good too. \n\nAlso, their Trio dessert is to die for,  creme brulee trio, jalapeno brulee ?? yes please, I will take it anytime. \n\nVERY conveniently located across the street from me... :) so I will keep trying new things for sure!
