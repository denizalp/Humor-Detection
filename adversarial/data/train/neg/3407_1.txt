Stellar Home Services of Goodyear AZ was absolutely outstanding. Their customer service was through the roof. I had a toilet in the upstairs bathroom of my rental in Glendale AZ leak and go down through the wall and come out in the downstairs bedroom.  I had another person come out and give me a bid, said I should contact my insurance company because I it was going to cost between $2,000 - $4,000. He never sent me an invoice. I got a second opinion. I contacted my Home Warranty company, One Guard who referred SHS. The work was done quick and it only cost me $400. The other company tried to screw me. Apparently that company, according to Yelp reviews have done that with other people. I highly recommend using Stellar Home Service as you will not be disappointed. Great work and most importantly, they are honest.
