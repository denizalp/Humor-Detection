One star only because I couldn't select less. The only highlight was the service. The staff kept the table clear and the drinks full. As for the food, the two best items there were the obviously frozen shrimp and the grape leaves. The mac and cheese had a half inch of grease on the top of the pan, pasta was \"cooked to order\" but the guy who prepared it filled the pan with oil and then proceeded to BURN all of it. The dessert bar had nothing but cut up pastries from a big box store and sloppy pans of \"cobbler\". Next time I'll hit the chain buffet or fast food. Thanks but no thanks.
