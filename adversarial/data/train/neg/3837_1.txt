I was very disappointed to find out the main attraction I came to see was no longer in exhibit. If you are like me who checked out their site to see pictures of the landscape art on the main page but didn't get an opportunity to see in person while here I feel bad for you too. But, you're in luck, the entire gardens were beautiful and breathtaking! I wish I could have stayed all day here. I felt very relaxed and blissful while walking around and seeing so many pretty flowers and greenery. My fondest memory is sitting in lawn chairs with my bf now fianc√© and just enjoying the moment. I will never forget. Try to purchase tickets in advance so you can just walk in and enjoy all the scenery!
