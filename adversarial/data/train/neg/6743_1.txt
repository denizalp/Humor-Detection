We were in Vegas for 1.5 days and came here for brunch twice! The crispy chicken on scones with pepper jelly is mouthwatering!! In addition, the brussel sprouts are the best I've ever had! The Cherry on top of the pie was that when we told them it was our anniversary they surprised us with two glasses of champagne.These little touches to a long way :)
