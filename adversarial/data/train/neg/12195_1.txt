So glad that I was able to find this franchise in my hometown! So much candy, pop, toys, and retro nostalgia packed in one shop. I will definitely return here especially when I'm working on gift baskets and furnishing my house. Tons of tin signs adorn the walls. And the employees genuinely care about your satisfaction. I can't wait to go back!
