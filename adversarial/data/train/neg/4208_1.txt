Menu is great, everything looks delicious! I ordered the Italia Benny's and was surprised to taste a spicy hollandaise - turns out they put cayenne pepper in the sauce. I'm not a big fan of spice so I found it to be too much, but my boyfriend loved it. Service was OK; very nice hostess, but the server wasn't around much.
