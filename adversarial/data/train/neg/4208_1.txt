This location just opened in June.I bought a 3 piece meal.It wasn't busy during the mid afternoon,one customer,me.The front counter person who may be the owner\/manager wasn't personable.The flavor shots at the fountain were covered with a white piece of paper.Before viewing a picture online,I asked him what it was because I was looking for the ice dispenser. He never explained. Unenthusiastic interaction between this man,and myself who was their ONLY customer,and was looking forward to trying their halal fried chicken. I nearly wanted to just not order,and go elsewhere.The chicken was disappointing to okay at best. The rings were okay,and the biscuit was slightly better.First,and last visit.
