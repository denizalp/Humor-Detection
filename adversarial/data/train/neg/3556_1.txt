This is my second attempt. Still unsure how I feel. In my immediate neck of the woods it's definitely close to as good as it gets. Unfortunately that's not saying much. I've liked everything thus far but haven't loved anything. \n\nMy companion loved the guacamole so much they took it home, and we all no that will be no bueno before the sun comes up.\n\nI will give it another shot as they are up and coming and update you all.\n\nThe staff at Lenero informed me that they were opening another location soon....I was slightly perplexed as I thought you had to be doing well to start other locations, a myth maybe?
