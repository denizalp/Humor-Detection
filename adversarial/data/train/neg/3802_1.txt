The night started off great. The bartenders were exceptionally friendly and the prices were really good. \nMy friends and I were having a great time until a biker dude asked my friend to take a photo with him. My friend was cool with it and noticed a knife in the biker's vest. When he asked if it was, in fact, a knife, the dude clocked him in the face. My friend didn't swing back, didn't yell at him, he just asked him what the punch was for. And guess what? Security told us that WE had to leave, even though we did absolutely nothing wrong. \nThat pissed us all off because now we know where this place's morals are. I can assure you they never kicked out the guy who punched my friend because we came back to check and he was still there. We couldn't go back inside either. What a crock.
