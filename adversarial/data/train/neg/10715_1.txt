Margaritas are good, nice selection of tequilas, the ceviche was pretty good. No salsa brought out with ceviche and chips appetizer. The tacos ordered were:. al pastor (average tasting), pulled pork (better than the previous), shrimp diabla (nice and spicy), carne asada (steak tasted cheap, not well marinated), and papas con chorizo (ordinary).\nBiggest issue were the tortillas! And this is what makes or breaks the taco. They are tortillas from the store! They are not made on the property, they tasted old and were tough to eat. \nThe margaritas were tasty and they are well served with tequila. We drank a house margarita called the local, which was very good and also had the Cadillac margarita which is pretty strong. \nBest thing was the ambiance. Great decor, good party atmosphere if you go at night, good wait staff and friendly hostesses. \nWould recommend for drinks and appetizers, but I have tasted and made better tacos at home.
