To me, the Bellagio's buffet is the piece de resistance of buffets.  Everything you could ask for -- prime rib, shrimp, crab legs -- nicely laid out and easy to access and locate.  And attentive service.\n\nIt's the priciest of the strip buffets, so be prepared.  And it's even more on a holiday.  Come hungry.
