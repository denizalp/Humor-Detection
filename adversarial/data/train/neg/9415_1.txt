If no stars will be an option I would choose it.  It is the worst treatment a person could get. Just because you are blessed with our loss of having a collision and come to your business to have our automobile repaired doesn't entitle the reps to treat down a customer. When I come to a business as a customer I am bringing income I am not begging for a free repair.  I need to be treated with respect because if not you will get the same response and no business means you're not getting my or my insurance's .  The reps say it is by appointment only estimates. There was no other customer waiting there. When I arrived the second time same day to try to have the estimate done a little earlier both of the reps got up and played off that they were doing estimates on the cars that were parked in the parking lot all afternoon. Instead of doing an estimate on a waiter client. The reps could not work with my schedule just to make a point that is by appointment. So I played their game I came back a third time guess what the cars that they were so busy the first two times doing estimate they were still in the parking lot. So I made them do the estimate and for insurance purposes and I took my car to a different place with better reviews, better customer services and lower prices.
