i was looking for a new yellow car down the road the the dealer wanted money down and told me it would be a special order and would take months.\n\nhence started my journey to goben cars :) .  they had a yellow one with a new car warranty  i found the price was right - i worked with bryan - i liked him - i liked the team - they worked well together for the good of each other and the customer.  i did not feel jerked around or played.  my son bought his car there an recommended them - i am glad he did.  of course never buy anything with blinders on - i feel i got a fair honest deal there and would recommend them.
