Very overpriced and blandly mediocre.  Service is sloooowww- you will literally go for 15 minute stretches without seeing a single waiter or busboy.  My soup noodles smelled disconcertedly like hot urine.  \"Chicken\" lettuce wraps are 90% minced water chestnuts.  Add a 25 minute wait just to be seated, and it's just salt in the wound.\n\nIf you're looking for tastier Chinese food, bite the bullet and walk to the Venetian, where Noodle Asia serves up far superior hangover recovery food.
