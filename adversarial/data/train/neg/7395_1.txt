Had read the reviews on Yelp about Pearl King before purchasing a Groupon, so knew to expect higher prices than a Chinatown experience.  But the prices can be justified by:  ability to make a reservation (a criteria for the Groupon, but also great to be able to reserve a table);  and a nice spacious and CLEAN seating area.\n\nWe were really pleased by the dishes we ordered for lunch:  Har gow;  Siu Mai;  BBQ pork buns, Hockey Pucks, chicken dumpling, a scallop skewer and the shrimp-stuffed portabello mushroom.  A few of the servings were on the small side - the scallop skewer was literally ONE scallop divided into 3 thin slices, but it was tasty.  We loved the stuffed portabello the most as it is different from what you can order from other places.  \n\nBased on Yelp reviews, we also knew to expect a potential tea service charge, and were ready to dispute it if it appeared on our bill.  I had water, and my friend had iced tea.  The glass of Iced tea was $4!  But no other service charge.\n\nMy Groupon was $15, which gave a $30 credit on my bill.  The bill incl tax and credit came to around $20, + tip = $26.  For $41 total outlay ($15+$26), it was a decent but kind of expensive lunch (but in a nice setting).  If the bill had been without the Groupon, I don't think it would have been worth it at all!\n\nAfter our lunch, my friend and I went shopping downtown.  About 90-120 minutes after lunch, we were extremely parched, and our feet felt swollen (despite unhurried walking).  Our conclusion was that the dim sum was likely laden with MSG.  Typically neither of us have extreme reactions to MSG (and realize it's often in Chinese food), but since we shared a lunch, we figured it was the culprit.  Too bad it was a bad ending to what was otherwise an OK dim sum lunch.
