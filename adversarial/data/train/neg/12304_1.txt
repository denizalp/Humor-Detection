I can see why some people had a hard time at first at this CL boutique. There are a lot of looky lookers, I mean, how can you not? CLs and those gorgeous red bottoms are the pieces that shoe fantasies are made out of! But still, despite whether a person will buy or not, everyone should get treated properly with the same respect. \n\nI came in to get some reprieve from my Irizas that I love and are so gorgeous to wear, but for my heel and arch are so uncomfortable! I wanted to try the Corneille, which for some reason my personal shopper at Neiman's told me was no longer being made. So not true!!! The sales associates here not only directed my way to these gorgeous beings, but they helped me decide between the patent and the softer matte jazz leather. Between trying on four different pairs in three different sizes (yes! Even within the same brand, each style varies by size) I walked out carrying a brand new pair of Corneille in the nude jazz leather. And they even directed me to a high end shoe repair in California to reheel my 85mm Décolleté heels (I tore them up pretty bad at an airport once) that would cater to having them ship and receive my shoes. They were so helpful that I mentioned that I may want the Corneille in the black too, but was indecisive about them, so they gave me their card and said to just let them know and they would ship it to my home. Now THAT is customer service!!
