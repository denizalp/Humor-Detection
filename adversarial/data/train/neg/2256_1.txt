The absolute worst customer service. The scheduler was rude when I called to make my appt. The only reason I continued to come here was for Becky Gonzalez, NP who is amazing. I was notified she now has a limited schedule and doesn't have any openings until October. Do you think anyone notified her pts of get schedule change? Of course not. I make an appt with another NP. I'm told to be here 30 minutes early to fill out paperwork. I come as asked 30 minutes early to do 3 minutes of paperwork. My appt is at 1 pm. I don't go back to a room until 2:15. I'm told to changed into the paper gown and the Dr will be right with me. So I wait, 20 minutes freezing to death. I ask for a blanket and am told they don't have any and the building controls the temperature. I recommend that they get some blankets. The girl smirked at me and closed the door. I remain freezing until 3:10 when the NP finally comes in. Rough exam by the NP. Never coming back.
