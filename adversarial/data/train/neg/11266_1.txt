I was a dj for a wedding in this venue recently. The venue is very nice. The acoustics are decent. I suggest some dance lights or uplights, but it is a really nice place. I don't know what the capacity is, but I'm guessing it can fit between 400 and 500 guests. Parking is pretty easy as well as loading and unloading of equipment.
