Rikishi was completely empty when I visited tonight, and given the general lack of sushi in my hood I was surprised and nervous about the quality of the raw fish I was about to devour. \n\nI was pleasantly surprised by the sushi. I didn't have anything out of the ordinary (some ebi sushi, california rolls) and it was all fresh and as it should be. I wasn't so much a fan of the things that normally aren't screw-up-able. Their miso soup was watery, their edamame needed more salt and the ginger salad had a mayo-like dressing. I really hate it when the ginger dressing is creamy. Some people like it. Not this guy. \n\nThe decor is simple and what you'd expect at a cheap sushi place. My dining companion and I sat in the cute little private dining area with curtains all around it. This was definitely a saving grace for this place. I felt like the wizard of Oz. Brilliant. \n\nPEPPER'S PISSED: A little on the pricey side for what it is.
