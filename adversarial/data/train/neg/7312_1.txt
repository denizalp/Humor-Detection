Stopped there for fish since its Lent and its fairly close to my neighborhood.  The older folks in front of me could not hear the cashier and she had to repeat everything three or four times.  She needs to speak up so they can hear her.  Very busy, one cashier, not two.  Restaurant - tables, floor - very dirty as everyone was in back getting orders ready. It seems to be that way whenever I stop in that location.  Side dishes size would work well for toddlers, not adults.  Very small side so if you get their wonderful cole slaw, order two or three.
