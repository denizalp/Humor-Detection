This place was good! My last 2 visits was TERRIBLE!!!! Today I had dinner with my family and we ordered 32.99 bucks for all you can eat per person!\nThe service was disappointed! The server name Jenny was rude when I asked for rice. She told me like I am asking for something especial ! She answered me sorry the bowl of rice is over you must wait for that. Stranger because I saw her 3 minutes after giving around 6 rices for another table. I just keep watching if she remembered my request n nothing. And also we ordered steamed egg, corn and soy soup , OMG waiting for 20-30 min and I saw her giving for another Korean customers table looks like restaurant owner friends first . And the beef soup n cold noodle was no seasoning . The broth looks like just water some salt . Poor quality and variety of side dishes . Dry corn , soy soup with just water n soy paste ....Terrible! Made my wallet empty without eat well , Don't recommend this place.\nI was fidelity customer there, but from now never going back . There are lot many Korean BBQ options around there!!!
