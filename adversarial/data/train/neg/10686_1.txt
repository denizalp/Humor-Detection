Quick Stop in Vegas before traveling to LA, my wife and I needed something quick and easy before heading out. So we decided to hit Eggslut because we both enjoy eggs especially on Breakfast sandwiches and on Burgers. My wife tried the sausage, egg and cheese while I tried the Burger and I Added Bacon.  I have to be honest, I don't really see what all the hype was about. Don't get me wrong, the food was good, but it's nothing to write home about. It's a typical burger with egg and a breakfast sandwich on a really good choice of Bread. The price point was a little high, but it's also on Vegas so that understandable.
