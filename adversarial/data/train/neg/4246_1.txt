It's a pity that there's no pub right next door to this place because they would have a rip-rawking business catching people as they stumbled out looking for something with which they could mop up the Coronas, while oblivious to the fact that Mexican food and Chinese had been combined. Yep, who knew that cheese on top of Chinese actually tasted pretty good. \n\n\"Yeah...,\" I hear you say, \"you're Scottish and you eat those furry, wee beasties that roam around the mountains in that, there yonder place.\" Touche... But, you know what's in the food here and it actually is unique and tastes completely DELISH! :) What's more, they have a gluten-free menu! Yay! \n\nOff the top of my head, the following items were GF:\nJade Red Pork\/Chicken\nEmerald Chicken\nGringo Chicken\nEgg Foo Young (minus the pork and gravy)\nPollo Diablo \nMachaca\nCarnitas\nRice\nBeans\n\n\nI plumped for the Emerald chicken and Jade Red Chicken with black beans and rice. Soooo good. I don't mind the aluminum food bowls at all, but then I didn't come here with the mistaken impression that I was eating at Chez Froo Froo or having afternoon, high tea at The Ritz.\n\nAnyway, I'll definitely be going back. Chino offers great value for money and the staff are uber-friendly! A big thumbs-up from me. I'll update with five stars when more nutritional info is given for items on the menu.
