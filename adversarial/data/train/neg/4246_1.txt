This place is the bomb. I don't know why I ever bother getting pizza from anywhere else. Definitely my favorite pizza place in Toronto. My favorite is the Smoked Chicken pizza with b√©chamel sauce. YUM. And the owner is so sweet and funny and great with kids. Not much seating, but worth standing up and eating the amazing pizza if you have to.
