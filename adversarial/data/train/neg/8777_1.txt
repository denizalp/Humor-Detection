We had some late dinner here post- Cirque on a Saturday night. \nWe ordered a salad (I forgot what kind, but remember it was tasty) and the mushroom pizza. If you don't like mushrooms, which I don't, don't convince yourself that the mushroom pizza will have a little mushroom on it. Because it will come to you fully covered in mushrooms and you will not enjoy it. The crust was good, the pizza was generally oily. \nThis place is just alright. The prices are good compared to what else you have around.
