So excited to see they've opened a pop up right by my house on Queen W. My BF and I  walked out with: Salted caramel brownie, Maple Caramel square, Apple caramel ice cream, Cinnamon crunch ice cream and rum raison ice cream. The ice cream had large chunks of ingredients - caramel, raisons, crunchy bits. Best ice cream I've ever had. The salted caramel brownie was soft, gooey and had the perfect amount of salt. Olenka's is going to give Bang Bang, the hipster ice cream place down the street, a run for their money. I prefer Olenka's 100%. Now, time for a nap. So full!
