We are selling our home and needed a window repaired\/replaced within a 2 week time frame! Crystal Clear View Glass came out within a few days of calling, measured, ordered the glass and came back a week later to install.  For some reason the initial new glass did not fit.  However, after talking to them they were able to rush the fix and return the same evening to install the new glass!  We appreciate their speedy install, polite and friendly staff, and great job!  Would recommend to anyone! I was frantic we wouldn't have it done in time to close but they saved the day! We are very happy!  Wendy in the office and Brandon the installer were great!
