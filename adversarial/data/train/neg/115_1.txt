By far the best food I've discovered in Arizona. Sorry Arizona but you are by far the worst place I've ever lived but The Arrogant Butcher made me forget for 2 hours that I was in Arizona. Got a table for two immediately even with a line out the door. Even with the place being beyond packed the service and food were top notch! Pic of San Tan Moon Juice IPA I had with my meal.
