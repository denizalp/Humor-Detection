This place is my kind of bar.\n\nReally extensive craft beer menu, which includes tap dates. I had the same bartender each of the three times I went, and he remembered what I and each member of my party had ordered the previous time.  I was totally comfortable telling the bartender to \"give me something great,\" and trust he'd pull a good beer for me.  He did not disappoint.\n\nAs other yelpers have said, there are two floors, with the upstairs having a hidden DJ loft, and a large table which lifts to the ceiling on weekends to create a dance floor.\n\nTo be honest, I much preferred the earlier part of the week, where quiet blues was playing and some baseball was on the TV, to the later, louder week with the Lady Gaga and the shiny-shirted ladies and gelled gents, but that's just my scene.  The beer, the staff, and the service were great.
