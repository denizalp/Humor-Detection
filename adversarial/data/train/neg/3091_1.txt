I altered my way home, adding 30 minutes to my commute, in order to pick up items for a business luncheon we are hosting. They closed 20 minutes early.   The door was dead bolted even though I could see the employees inside. If you plan to use them, call to verify the hours they actually plan on being open ahead of time!
