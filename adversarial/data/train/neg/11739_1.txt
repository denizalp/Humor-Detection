This location is a lot more pleasant to dine at then it's Scottsdale location. \nThe Scottsdale location is always busy with Scottsdale's finest soccer moms. Screw that. \n\nPita jungle is a decent place if you are looking for food that is a bit healthier. Lots of vegetarian and light fare is offered here. \nI always get the same thing, because I am a meat eater. The Gyro pita with a side of the Garlic roasted potatoes. I am disappointed that they use the preformed fabricated gyro meat for this pita. Would like to see them use the fresh shaved meat. But by judging the clientele, I'm sure it's one of the least popular pitas. \n\nService is always adequate. Great spot to grab a pita and iced tea and hang out.
