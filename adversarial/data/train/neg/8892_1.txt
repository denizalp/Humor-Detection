About once a week me and some friends order to go from here! They always have the PJ's Famous Hamburger & Fries and I usually have a grill cheese & creamy tomato soup! \nSuch a fabulous idea, for them to deliver in Forum Shops and Caesars Palace ! \nIf you're in town, stop by, if you're a local, this is the place to be for your treats! \nAlso their happy hour with $1 oysters is the best in town! \nEnjoy!
