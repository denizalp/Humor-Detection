Went by for lunch again, tried the Buldogis Chicago Dog with kimchi add-on.  In retrospect probably not the best combo, but kimchi is fresh and good, and they give you ample amounts.  The combo of the dog, kimchi, pickled peppers, catchup & mustard make it much too salty, however.  I think the bulgogi or spicy pork with the addition of kimchi will be the real winners.  Still, this is good stuff.
