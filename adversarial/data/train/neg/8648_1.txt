I have been wanting to try this place for a while now and met up with a dear friend this morning for coffee and (what ended up being) dessert  The menu is really interesting, very diverse and reasonably priced.  There is outdoor seating, as well as a casual indoor dining area.  \n\nNeither of us got beyond the bakery case!  My friend had a piece of banana cream pie cheesecake and I had apple pie...we agreed that both were amazing.  The coffee was also yummy.\n\nBertha's is a great choice for a quick snack and catch-up; I'll definitely be back soon for seconds on the pie, and to get acquainted with more of the savory items.
