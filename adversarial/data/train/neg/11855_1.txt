This is an update to my previous review. I'm changing my rating from a 1 to a 3. I'm doing this because after I wrote the first review, they reached out to me and tried to rectify the situation and the relationship. I appreciate that they made the effort. I can't comment on their work as I decided to go with another company. \n\nFirst review:\nI called this company once each day for two days to get an estimate on a small job. They did not feel it was necessary to call me back either time, as promised. If you don't want my job, that's fine, just tell me and stop wasting my time. If you don't care, I don't want you working on MY home.
