Hip Vegas boutique hotel located right across from the Hard Rock hotel.  Intimate and personal, a good alternative to the massive hotels located on the strip.  \n\nDecor is very decadent and a little gothic with dark purples and blacks.  \n\nStayed at the suite complete with mirrors located in compromising places (wink, wink), and a hot tub located right in the bedroom.
