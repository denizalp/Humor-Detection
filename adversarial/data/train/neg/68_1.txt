Watch Out HOT N JUICY!!  This contender is right down the block, gloves on and ready to rock.  Being it  was my first time eating here the experience was really great.  Food tasted more authentic! (Unlike Hot N Juicy)\n\nOrdered - \n1lbs Crawfish -Medium House special style\n1bls Shrimp -Mild house special style\n1\/2 Dozen Blue Crab\n\nFirst of all, the Crawfish was right on point.  And what I mean is that the flavor is IN the crawfish meat and not disguised by 1 gallon of liquid flavoring. (Unlike other places)  Btw, I'm ordering mild next time.  LOL\n\nSecondly, the Shrimp.  IN-CRED-DIBLE!  Huge as S&%T.  Like Shrimp of viagra.  Not none of this frozen walmart bullc$#p they serve you at other places.  (ehhmmm....Hot N Juicy)\n\nThirdly, Blue Crab was pretty good as well.  They sprinkled it with some spicy crack that made you want more even when your mouth was blistering hot!\n\nI have to admit that this place needs to work on faster service.  But its better than waiting an hour at .....ehhhmmm.....\"other places\"\n\nI would definitely recommend this place over.....ehmmm.....\"other places\" especially if you don't mind NOT eating at a place that paid to be on TV.  \n\nA little street cred - Yes, I have lived down south (Biloxi, MS) and know what authentic crawfish tastes like.  And it doesn't taste like rubber with 1 gallon of spicy juice on it.  Again people, My Opinion.
