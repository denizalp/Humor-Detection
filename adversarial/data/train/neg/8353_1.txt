Byebye Archie's, Pin Kaow, and all other Thai food places in Vegas (imho also Lotus and Komol). Clean, friendly, great (and very reasonably priced) vino selection, DELICIOUS food!  Really special dishes where thought was put into each dish with nice balance of flavors.  I don't understand why reviewers say the portions are small. I think for the price and quality, it's quite reasonable. This is the normal amount of food people should be eating anyway. It is a little tacky that rice is not included with curry though. Even though it's a trek to Chinatown, this is where we go when craving Thai. I'm excited to see how Chef Bank's new place, Chada Street, turns out. \n\nOne mini note - I despise the shopping center it's in, it is so hard to find parking on a weekend night, so we try to go earlier for an early dinner or during a weeknight.  It's not a huge space, so if going w a large group, I'd def call ahead to make reservations.
