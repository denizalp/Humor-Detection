Went for my 18th birthday about 2 months ago. I initially headed to htc where I was turned away so I made my way to Halo. (Biggest blessing in disguise!!) I walked in and immediately was greeted and with a smile! The lady at the front grabbed my I.D. really quickly got me the paperwork and got me in line! She helped me choose out everything I want for my jewelry. I got my double nostril and tragus this time. I showed her what I wanted for my nose and she told me that since my nose is a little smaller I could do the same diamond but a little smaller so that it would fit better which was very helpful. Then for my tragus I wanted a pink opal stud and she went \"please let me talk you out of that\" which helped so much. I really appreciate it when the professionals at these places truly do care about how I will look when I'm done. Anyways, I ended up getting a white opal for my tragus and it is BEAUTIFUL. Choosing jewelry here was genuinely so hard because they had so many beautiful options! It was a pretty long wait but I was prepared and wasn't really in a rush but I did have an appointment for a tattoo and I let them know and they told me that I could go get that done and they keep my spot in line and as soon as I get back that I would be first in line. So I went to get my tattoo and it took about an hour, but as soon as I got back they got me right in. At first the piercer was a little bit snippy but I just took it as being a professional(she knows more than I do so I'm not going to step on any toes or question her). Both of my piercings were painless and effortless. She went so fast I had no clue that it had happened! Towards the end she really warmed up and was so nice to us! She gave me al the tips to take care of my jewelry and sent me on my way. I definitely plan on coming back within the next few month!!
