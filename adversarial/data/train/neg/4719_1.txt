My husband and I wanted to try out some Korean food and what we found was wonderful. The atmosphere of Hibiscus is really upscale and classy. The menu is simple but has lots of adventurous things all at a reasonable price. We got the chicken skewers, spring rolls, and bibimbap with mango and sticky rice for dessert (I know it is really Thai). Everything was super yummy and fresh. Great comfort food! This would make a nice place for a classy date night or just a yummy dinner with friends.
