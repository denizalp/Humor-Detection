I will never again order from this business (that I have previously ordered from many times) for their failure to deliver what is expected\/promised. I ordered (24 hours in advance) roses for my mother for Valentine's Day. Did my mother get roses? No, she received a bouquet of carnations with two dying roses thrown in. I understand Valentine's day is a busy time. That's why I ordered in advance. I understand that they may have had bigger orders than they expected (and hence the flower change out). But for the flowers to be not only what I didn't order and pay for, but to be in terrible condition (and delivered at 7:30 at night) is just unacceptable. No one from the business called me and told me they would be changing out the flowers. No one asked me if this was okay. Instead, someone did a terrible job of trying to substitute something I didn't pay for, for what I did before and hoped it wouldn't matter. It did and always will. Never again will I purchase\/order from here.
