I have had very good food from this location. I have tried several Vegetarian Dishes and all have had great flavor and were cooked just right. They are usually so busy the wait is the only thing that I found negative for them and really it just means a lot of people are ordering their food. So maybe not a real negative overall. I did not have any issues over my last several orders but I do pick up and it appears the issues are with delivery. Hope this review helps someone try them out.
