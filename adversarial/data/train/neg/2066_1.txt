My family and I have been patients at Dynamic Eye Care for many years, the doctors are always professional and friendly.  The main reason I would recommend this office is because of the urgency in which they respond to serious situations.  My daughter's cornea was scratched at a gymnastics meet on a Saturday, we drove straight to the office (without calling), as my 7 year old daughter screamed in the back of the car.  As soon as we walked in, the doctor saw my daughter and got her the necessary care needed.  In this day and age, that kind of personalized care just doesn't seem to happen anymore.  This example has made us Dynamic Eye Care patients for life.
