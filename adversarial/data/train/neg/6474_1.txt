Had a great experience at Mile End Kicks today when I walked in sopping wet with my shoes and socks just utterly soaked through. Calm and friendly gents helped me consider options and before I knew it I was in love and laced up in a pair of super water proof and cute men's boots and in dry socks too! \n\nThe store is in two small but well-appointed rooms on a pretty corner of Parc. The shoes - brands and models - make sneaker people smile and nod happily. Not a huge selection and not cheap stuff, but excellent for exactly what it is.
