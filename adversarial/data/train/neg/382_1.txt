Had to replace a rear view mirror on my Hyundai. Mike matched my quoted price and had it take care of in about 20 mins. Very friendly and good service. I will be coming back to have some more work done. Only advice I'd have for this shop is the guy who works their front desk - ZERO communication skills & had no intention of helping me out. Was frustrated at first until I spoke with Mike, start with Mike and you'll be good to go!
