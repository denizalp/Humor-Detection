Needed to return a lease, called 3 times and left messages twice for a Vinnie (he dodged my phone call the second time) and he still refused to return my calls. I found another dealership that was more than happy to take it back. They were pleased to hear the car was in great condition with only 14k miles on it. I'm sure they will have no problems reselling it and making money off of it.\n\nI think this is the first time I have ever heard of a dealership not wanting a car they were guaranteed to make money off of.  This is also the first time a dealership wouldn't return my calls in the hopes of trying to get a sale out of me.
