We do love this place and have worked with jade on various parties and she is outstanding. One disappointing thing is the they have hoverboards you can try out there but we have gone twice and the response has been \"sorry, we have no one to watch that area right now so you can't ride them.\"  They need hours of operation posted so you don't waste your time
