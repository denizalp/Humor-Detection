We had an absolute fantastic time at the concert.  The venue was perfect.  The sound and lighting was perfect.  The vendors selling concert merchandise were quick and efficient.  The lines for food and beverage weren't too bad. I did think it was a little crazy that the bottled water was $1 more then the soda?   I never visited the restroom, so unsure how that would have went.  I saw the line for the women's restroom was quite long, but usually is.
