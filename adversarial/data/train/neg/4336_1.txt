Moe's BBQ in Matthews for those who don't know 14 beer taps...from my memory they are as of yesterday and they have daily $3 specials and their ice tea is perfect too if you don't care from beer.\n\nDFH 90 minute\nFoothills Jade\nOlde Hickory Imperial Stout\nFounders Porter\nNoDa Hop, Drop 'n Roll\nNoDa Gordgeous\nBirdsong\nand a few more I can't recall.\n\nThe food is awesome!! Love the BBQ but the fried chicken on Wednesday is really good, and the shrimp \"Mo boy\" sandwich is incredible! (had it twice this week) Their sides are all fresh homemade with some being everyday and some daily specials. All have been GREAT so far with the succotash and jalapeno cheese grits being my favorite so far! My wife got the sweat potato casserole as a dessert and it too was amazing...topped with toasted corn flakes I think the only thing it needed was a little whip cream!!! The only disappointment so far has been the banana pudding...it has no bananas.\n\nOn our first visit we sorta gripped about the serving sizes of the sides, but for $10 you get a sandwich, 2 sides, and a drink and we have not left hungry. The building is nice with roll up bay doors, screens, and 2 outdoor patios.
