First time visit and for lunch. I have to say, the food was fresh and delicious! I loved all the dim sum dumplings and chicken wings and the egg rolls were to die for. They even had a huge pan of bacon!\nI did miss that there was no salt n pepper squid but maybe that's an evening dish. \n\nRestaurant was very clean and the servers were quick to refill drinks, very rare in a buffet. \nI'm so sad I never went here sooner but will make sure I rectify that.
