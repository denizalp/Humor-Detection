Wow! talk about value. I've enjoyed eating at the Casa Grecque on Prince Arthur, but this D.D.O. location is in a league all it's own.\nBoth I & mom took lunch specials, being used to the portions at  Prince Arthur, I order the tzatziki side dish. We started with a super fresh and tasty salad bar, which in itself could be a meal as it had peel shrimp, calamari, feta cheese, hummus, and though not the most extensive, everything was fresh and well-prepared. The wheat bread rolls were served hot, the plates arrived within 5 minutes, the service was attentive but not sticky. We ate and ate until we could no longer. I bagged and brought home 1\/3 of the food. While the coffee and dessert where nothing to write home about they were more than passable. \nWhat's deceptive is looking at the front of the restaurant you can't tell if it's open. Upon approaching the front door we notice it was propped open.\nWhen I asked a server where the bathroom was he said it was under reno & I would have to go to the 3rd floor events room next to the Jacuzzi - I replied can I use the Jacuzzi too?\nWe'll definitely be back. The parking situation downtown is what keeps us from frequenting the Prince Arthur location but here there's loads of parking but we have a fair drive to get to it but it's worth it.
