Well, this is going to hurt. \nFirst of all all truly love this wholefoods. I do. So here you have it guys 4 stars. I cannot complain one bit.\nNow the nasty part. \nJust bought a 'tres leches' from Vegas pita $5.99 among other things. \nI take a bite at home and to my surprise it has coffee in it. TONS of coffee in it.  I hate coffee. The label doesnt say it contains coffee. Not listed as an ingredient. Not listed as a name close to where 'tres leches' is. \nIs imperative that Vegas Pita get this straight. Next time it could be someone with a big allergy and boom!! You have a big problem in your hands. \nTo say the least i'm very upset since you now know i HATE  coffee. And now i have nothing sweet after my lovely pizza.   I should've stick to my usual macarons and the lovely raspberry bar. Soooooooo yum!!!! \n\n\nFunny thing is that after reading the label i found out it has tequila. Lol. Couldnt fine the flavor of it. Lol
