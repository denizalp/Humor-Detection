The whole process at Green Valley Fertility Partners from the beginning consultation to the \"graduation\" has been extremely positive and rewarding for us.I first contacted them in August, and three months later, we are expecting a little girl next year June. \nWe had constraints in the scheduling because my husband's insurance which covers IVF were to end in Nov, but Green Valley Fertility Partners was flexible, and was able to squeeze me in the next cycle. Also, the insurance filing for all the medications plus procedures are a complicated task, but Amy and Suzette did a perfect job allowing us to be covered through the whole cycle. \nDr. Fisch is amazing, kind and knowledgable. both Amy and Dr. Fisch were very responsive and prompt in responding to our silliest questions.\nIVF is not a simple procedure, you have to follow many different medications that are changing throughout the process. They were very helpful in making sure I understood the cycle, and in explaining again when I was confused. The medication itself is not so painful, but you are in for a lot of pain after the egg retrieval. I had mild hyperstimulation, and the pain was very bad, keeping me from breathing at times. Dr. Fisch was very responsive, having me come over more frequently to monitor my progress afterwards. He was very reassuring, and I gradually felt better after the next few days, so I could successfully do a transfer. And last week I \"graduated\" from green valley fertility partners and I am to be released to a regular OB\/GYN.\nI truly believe that it was because I went with Dr. Fisch that my first cycle successfully resulted in a pregnancy. He is a great doctor, and the staff is phenomenal. It is very fortunate for Las Vegas that we have doctors of this quality available here.
