My friend brought me here when I came into town to visit her. I really wanted to love it but the staff left a bad taste in my mouth.\n\nFood: The hot dogs were delicious and HUGE, even without the mountain of toppings. I got a dog with chili, mac & cheese and caribbean slaw, and we split tots and fries on the sides (which included delicious dips and sauces). Unfortunately there was so much on the dog and it was so wet from the chili that the bun broke in half so I had to eat it with fork and knife.\n\nStaff: Here's where my issue was... We arrived at 8:45 on a Saturday to a sign saying they would start charging a cover for the band at 9. We didn't really gripe because we thought we'd stick around and listen, so we paid our $15 and proceeded to a table. We were then told that table service ended at 9 (again, it wasn't 9 yet) so we'd have to order from the bar. There weren't even 10 people in the bar even by the time we left, so it was sort of ridiculous that none of the 3 bartenders twiddling their thumbs could have served us or offered to refill our waters, but I digress. What really put me over the edge was that the band came out around 9:30, played ONE SONG for their sound check, and didn't make another appearance by the time we left at 10. We asked the [very bored-looking] doorman for our cover charge back when we left since we arrived before 9 AND the band didn't start, and without a shred of empathy he just said, \"Nah, can't do that.\"\n\nSo, come for a hot dog. The flavors are on point, though the overall dog can't really be eaten like a true hot dog. Don't expect the staff to be overly friendly or helpful if you come later in the evening.
