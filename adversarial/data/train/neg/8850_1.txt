If you're considering getting married at this venue, don't do it. I was married here a couple of weeks ago and the experience is still traumatizing to me. The wedding coordinator was rude, argumentative, and literally stood around a good portion of the wedding day, which left my maid of honor to set up and tell guests to go outside to the ceremony (they were sitting at reception tables because my coordinator didn't tell them where to go). The vendors (except for the photographer, she was great) also were not coordinated at all. It was like they had never met each other, even though they do weddings at this venue all the time. The only redeeming quality is the general manager, who actually met with us a couple of days later to address my concerns. She was the only person in the hotel that had told us thank you for getting married there and congratulations (and by this time we had been there for 4 days). The venue is beautiful, but if you want a stress-free wedding, this is not the place to go.
