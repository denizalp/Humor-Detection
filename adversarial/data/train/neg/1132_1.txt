My husband and I ate dinner here last night. A friend verified the good things we read on Yelp, and we took the plunge. This place is cute, inside. It's home-y and quaint feeling, like a little boutique.\n\nI had the salmon. It came with crunch artichoke hearts, israeli cous cous, and a pesto. It was refreshing and delicious. The best salmon I've ever had, by far.\n\nMy husband had the flat iron and was not disappointed, either. It wasn't a strip steak, mind you, but it delivered. It was tender, and accompanied by smashed potatoes. YUM.\n\nWe shared a side of mac n cheese, and it was by far the best mac and cheese I've had in my lifetime.\n\nThe BEST part, however, was dessert. We tried a brookie, and we scarfed it down so fast, I probably could have eaten two more of them. I'm going to have dreams about the brookie. It was to die for. I know I say that about everything, but I'm serious this time. I could die and go to heaven and only want a brookie for every meal for the rest of my life.\n\n\nNext date night we are going to try the sister restaurant in Tivoli, Made.\nHowever, we will absolutely be back!\n\nThank you for the outstanding service, Scott!
