I absolutely love Volume Beauty Bar and I always get my hair cut by Danica. She's all ears when it comes to understanding your needs and is very capable of recommending alternatives to a style that better suits your facial structure. Each time I arrive for a hairstyle, Danica and her team spend quality time with each individual, without rushing, to ensure the style is achieved. Highly recommended!
