Three strikes and you're out. Last visit was the worst. The Girl was really sweet, but she cut and drilled my cuticles terribly!! I was in so much pain and my cuticles scabbed up days after. I told her and felt bad because she didn't mean to, but still I was in so much pain.  I told the manager, but he wasn't too concerned and wanted me to send him photos for compensation or to honor my next service. Terrible management service and I wouldn't come back for another service after the last visit or recommend anyone here.\n\nUPDATE: This business did not fix any of the problems at all.
