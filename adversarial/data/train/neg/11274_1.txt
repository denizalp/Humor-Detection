We went to sushi ken today. They close at 230 and we arrive at 2:00. We have 30 minutes. Still our waitress thought it was okay to rush us through everything. She was yelling our Orders to the kitchen as we ordered it, grabbing the menus, stood over us almost forcing us to eat faster. It was horrible. And she was so rude, almost like \"wow your going to come in and eat when we're about to close?!\" I didn't tip her well because I thought she a very rude to us. When she saw the ticket all she could say was \"REALLY!? WOW! WOW! WOW! REALLY??\" She didn't even bother to come over and ask what was the problem. Safe to say we won't be going back there
