Wow.  Pretty much the best tapas restaurant i have ever been to.  It was our last night in Montreal.  We were STARVING yet wanted an experience.  We checked out the menu here and decided to stay.  What a great decision!  \n\nIf you don't feel brae enough to order your own tapas, they have a couple of  \"chef's choice\" menus.  We selected our own.  Grilled bread with fragrant olive oil, excellent wine, feta-stuffed grilled peppers, pan-seared scallops and octopus with ouzo,  bacalau croquettes, eggplant with lamb, OMG!  Too many wonderful things to mention.  Do yourself a favor and visit here on your next stop in Montreal.  \n\nThe waitstaff were sweet and patient, tool  You can't go wrong.
