I can't believe how helpful Jeremy Weiser from the Medicare Store was in making my enrollment in a new HMO go incredibly smooth.\n I called on a Friday and he showed up the very next day and was pleasant and very easy going, helpful and  knowledgeable about all things having to do with getting me in the best HMO most suited to my needs. \n Thanks Jeremy
