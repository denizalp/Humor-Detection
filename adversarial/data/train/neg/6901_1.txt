I was a little shocked to find out that the food is way better than what people reported.  I'm Korean and I love PHO.  The broth was very clean and refreshing -- not too heavy on the beef stock (in a good way).\n\nI ordered the PHO w\/ Fried Egg Rolls.  The friend egg rolls were excellent!  Very crispy and hearty fillings!  Would recommend getting this...how could you not?
