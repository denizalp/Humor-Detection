Nothing really wrong just not my jam.  Seated quickly by door and cold air came in every time someone entered.  As a single, I did appreciate that one side of my small table was bench seating.  Waitress efficient but no personality.  Food came out incredibly quick.  Eggs, potatoes, OJ and bacon good.  I paid $1 extra to get a biscuit instead of toast and that's when it went downhill.  First it was served with no butter.  Second it was huge but that meant it wasn't cooked enough inside.  Third it crumbled when I tried to butter it.  Maybe a great biscuit to go with gravy but definitely not a biscuit to serve instead of toast.  Plus the price was high on a basic breakfast.
