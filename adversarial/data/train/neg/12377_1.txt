Interesting and creative dishes. The Seven Layer Dip is delicious as are the brussels sprouts. Lots of vegetarian options. Great service and very friendly servers and hosts. Great atmosphere and ambience right down the charming Georges Brassens soundtrack! Very reasonable prices for this type of dining experience. Small restaurant (true bistro) and no reservations but wait time at 7pm on a Friday night was about 10 minutes and it was worth the wait.
