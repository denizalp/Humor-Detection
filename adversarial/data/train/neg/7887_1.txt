Unique and original theme...YES! Quality food...not so much. If the food tasted better I would have definitely bumped this place to a 4 star...nonetheless it was a FUN time! Went with a group of 20 and we had a blast with our waitress. She was rude and crude and we all loved it. She hijacked my friends phone and took a pic of her own boobs, she called us cheap asses, she threw our plastic utensils at us, and she came up with clever sayings or pictures for all of our hats. \n\nThis place is not for kids but I would return with my friends again because we had some great laughs. If you are way too conservative then I would suggest another restaurant but if you can roll with the punches and let loose then this is a great place to start off your night.  I say try it out but don't expect excellent food but be prepared for a good time.
