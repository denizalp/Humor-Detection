I actually didn't get a burger the time I went. My friend did and she said it was amazing, I had a bite and it surely was. I had a chicken sandwich, which had a burger look to it anyway. The only downside about this place is that you do not get sides with your burger or sandwich. Otherwise, loved it and will probably come back again. Service was nice and ordering was easy. Not a long wait time either.
