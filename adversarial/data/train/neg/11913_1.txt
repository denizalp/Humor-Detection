Walked in with 3 of my buddies and we each ordered an all dressed hotdog, all dressed double burger, fries and soda. The burgers are big and delicious and the dogs were cut down the middle and also tasted like heaven.  I don't know what's in the food but I'm definitely going back.\n\nThe only downside is that for a \"burger\", \"dog\" and \"fries\" it seems a little pricey but not by the time you're done eating!
