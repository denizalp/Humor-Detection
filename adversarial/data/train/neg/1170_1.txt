My husband and I ordered from here for delivery. We have been trying to find a good Mediterranean restaurant and the Yelp reviews were semi decent so decided to give it a go. We ordered hummus which is bland. Basically tasted like olive oil and the pita bread was given to us in the bag it came in because they do not make their own pita bread? Gyro was mediocre, not horrible but the Tzatziki sauce just tasted like sour cream. Giving 2 stars since it's not the worst I've ever had but FAR from the best.
