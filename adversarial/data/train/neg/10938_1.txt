I love the go back in time element of this place.  The ice cream sodas looked great and the store has plenty of seating for groups.  In the warmer weather they're open till 10 on weekdays and fri-sat i think midnight!  The gordon square sundae with coffee ice cream instead of the banana foster was delicious.  The ice cream was simple and smooth and I loved it.  The brownie was okay quality I think the base brownie drenched in fudge and ice cream tasted good but the side brownie piece was below average making me conclude the brownies just okay but becomes decent with the toppings.  I think I'd just stick with a sundae with brownie next time. This is fun place for celebrating birthdays and the staff were kind and accommodating!
