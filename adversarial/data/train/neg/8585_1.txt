Futo Buta makes ~miso~ happy. This place is seriously one of my all-time favorite restaurants. My very favorite bowl of ramen is the vegan butternut squash ramen, and I add corn (recommended by the waitress the first time I ordered it, and it's worth it). This is a seasonal menu item, but they seem to have it a lot. It's so flavorful and has great texture from the cauliflower, mushrooms, and other toppings. It's my benchmark for judging all other ramen, and it might be my choice for a last meal because it's so good. \n\nMy dad (my usual ramen date) always orders the Miso and adds spicy pork. It's on the spicy side to me, but it's reliably good. The Chizu is an accessible (and delicious) option with all of the cheese and would be a good choice for people who are unsure of what to try. The only ramen that I haven't enjoyed is the Fire and Ice. \n\nThe rice crispy squares are a must order for me each visit. The squares of rice are warm with a crispy exterior, which complements the raw tuna perfectly. The brussels sprouts are tasty. We've tried the pork belly buns once, and I wouldn't order them again (but I'm not a huge pork belly fan). The soft-serve is a good end to the meal. My favorite flavor has been the strawberry-basil, but it rotates regularly. The draft beer list features some local options, and they also have sake and sake cocktails. \n\nThe service is always great, and I usually recognize some of the same workers from previous visits. Seating can be difficult as this restaurant tends to get busy. They don't take reservations and your entire party has to be present to be seated. I like sitting outside here if the weather is nice because it feels less crowded than indoors. Check this place out if you haven't already!
