Went to see IT at their Cine 1 theater and omg it was amazing!!! The 83ft screen plus the very comfortable recounting seats! Everything was clean and comfortable. It was my first time experiencing a theater like this. I loved not having to show up extra early to get a good seat and being able to reserve the one you want. It was movie changing experience. I don't think I will be able to watch movies any other way now. Also, this theater serves alcohol so I was able to enjoy a kilt lifter beer during my movie.
