Food was just ok. Decided to eat in the establishment, that may have been the mistake. It seems to be a place that's take-out oriented but seating is available. The food took a long time to emerge after we ordered and we were served cold and soggy samosas. Maybe our experience was an anomaly given all the great reviews. Not sure if I would come back here.
