This was my first time at this nail salon and it was a very unfortunate experience. 3 girlfriends and I had appointments at 4:30 and waited about 10 minutes before we left. It was PACKED. Some of the regulars say this is a common experience when they come to this salon - this salon is not able to keep appointments. There was also not a single employee who even said \"hello\" to acknowledge our presence, which may have pacified me a bit. Very unprofessional.
