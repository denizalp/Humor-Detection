So, just a quick update, as I have been in several times now, with various friends... The opinion is universal, everyone has LOVED their food in here - and the coffee is great too. Very friendly people to boot. Nice, cosy atmosphere if you want to hang out and have a conversation over your coffee \/ meal. Highly recommend.
