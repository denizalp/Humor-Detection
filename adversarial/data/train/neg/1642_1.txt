My boyfriend and I went to Wedge this past Friday, thinking we would try something new after some friends were talking about Wedge.  We started off with the Yucatecan Ceviche, it sounded fresh and delicious and the description included habaneros.  We got our appetizer within a few minutes of ordering, it looked great, but not only was it not spicy, but it had barely any flavor.  We the ordered the Carnitas dinner plate, and I ordered the fish taco and the shrimp taco dinner.  The tacos were alright, again, very flavorless and the rice portion was laughable.  The Carnitas were absolutely flavorless and we found that there was more fat to pick out than actual good meat.  We both felt sick after eating here and were severely disappointed in a place that our friends thought was such a good place to eat and have drinks.  The ambiance was nice, a little dark to the point where we could barely read the menu and the wait staff was awkward and stood around at the bar most of the time.  There was a DJ playing pretty cool music, but it was WAY too loud for the size of the restaurant, and being seated so close to the speakers, it was highly unpleasant.  Overall, very unhappy with our first time at Wedge, we won't be back.
