This event space is brand new and unbelievable. Rooms are fully customizable down to the smallest of details and their production team is all in-house which is a huge plus. It really is a one-stop shop for hosting any kind of event, which is why I will be using Enclave for a corporate event this September. Would love to see them wheel a helicopter through those huge elephant doors!
