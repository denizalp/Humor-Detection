Passing through Champaign and grabbed lunch across the street from here. Couldn't resist stopping in to check out this place. Fantastic decor- feels very high design. The desserts are easy for takout and we grabbed an oreo cookie brownie for the road. It was delicious, and we'll be back for coffee and some more treats on our next trip back through Champaign.
