You know the joke, Whole Foods = Whole Paycheck? It can be, depending on what you get.\n\nIt's important to remember, you are paying for quality products. That means that the store is filled with healthy options, things that are good for you! So while it can be pricey I think it is well worth it. \n\nThough I don't do it 100% of the time, I'm easing into a vegan friendly diet and this store has many different options for vegetarians or vegans.  \n\nLastly, they even have a wide variety of healthy options for your pets as well. They carry my favorite brand, The Honest Kitchen. I firmly believe that our pets should eat well too! \n\nStaff here is always friendly and courteous. Everyone always seems to be smiling.
