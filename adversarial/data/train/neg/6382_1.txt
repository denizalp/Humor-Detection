Visited Maizie's for the first time on Sat, Jan 30.  This is a very appealing little spot, with room for about 30-40 diners inside and a patio with heaters.  They have a nice beer selection and a large wine list.  Two of our party had burgers... they stuff them... decent concept but when you bite into it you wind up wearing whatever is inside.  The ciabatta bread works well.  One of our party had the citrus chicken over broiled romaine.  nice looking dish... another had the \"Mac Daddy\" special, a mac and cheese thing with a cuke and radish salad.  No fireworks there.  Final member had the baked ziti offering and liked it, though was confused by the incongruous dollop of pesto over top of it.  Our party of five took an hour to get seated... not a big fan of that, though the staff were courteous and kept telling us they were working on getting us a table.  all in all, I think if I lived in the condos next door I'd probably hit this place once or twice a month, but otherwise, once was enough.
