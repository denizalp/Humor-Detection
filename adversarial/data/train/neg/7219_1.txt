Koi Sakana does ramen right. I been here many times and it is one of the best ramen place in Richmond hill if not all of the GTA. Usually i order the hokkaido ramen with the milky tonkotsu soup base. This time I decided to try the curry tonkatsu. Not really a fan of the curry but everything else I have tried is amazing. \n\nThe broth was hot and the noodles were thin and had a nice chewy texture. The waitress is super friendly and attentive. Note very few tables so there might be a bit of a wait during lunch hours.
