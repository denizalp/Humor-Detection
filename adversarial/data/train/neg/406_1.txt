One of our family's favorite place.  Love the food but menu doesn't seem to change.  Also food taste different even though we order same items almost every time.  IMO, food used to taste better before but changes for the worse over the years..  We still like it, just not as much as before.  My daughter loves Har Gaw skins..  Wish I can just order the skins only, Lolzzz.  I like the Walnut prawns and saut√©ed Green beans.  One thing I hate is that it is not closed in so you can smell cigarettes smoke from casino area
