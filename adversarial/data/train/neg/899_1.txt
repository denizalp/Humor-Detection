What an amazing staff! My 7 year old has had the most amazing first experiences at the orthodontist that you could ever hope for! Dr. Noorda is incredibly professional, thorough, and personable. Not one issue was left undiscussed in our initial consult, and every question was answered in complete detail. We knew we employed the services of the right orthodontist by the time we left! Our second visit was as wonderful as the first and the proof of his fantastic work is on the walls (literally!) and walking around Las Vegas. You can spot a \"Noorda smile\" anywhere...they're absolutely perfect!
