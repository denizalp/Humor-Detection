I live in Washington, DC and was visiting Toronto for a long weekend. My fiance and I decided to grab a nice dinner the evening we arrived (Thursday) and we were pleasantly surprised by the great food and service Keg provided. \n\nThe staff was very accommodating, friendly, and quite professional. For example, during dinner, there were a few times when my fiance and I were in the midst of a conversation and as I saw the waitress approach to check on us, she noticed we were talking and she chose to come back a few moments later. I know it's a small detail, but it's those small details that make for a great experience. \n\nAs for the food... the steak was great. We each ordered the fillet and they came out perfectly cooked (mine med-rare - my finance's med). You could clearly see and taste the difference between the two and it was well worth the price! The drinks we good as well - strong but not over powering.\n\nWhile I do acknowledge the comments other reviewers have written about the \"regulars\" in this place, I really feel that the ambiance and food outweigh those negatives.\n\nAll in all, next time I'm up in Toronto, I'm coming back to Keg for another fillet!
