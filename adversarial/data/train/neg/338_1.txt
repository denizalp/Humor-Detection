Nice place food just ok for the price service Luke any other fine dining room that is empty an hour before closing on the weekend evening if you want a quiet evening with a better service and don't mind paying almost double than olive garden  for the same food that is your place. \nThe do have some good specials .....but it may come with a risk...lol\nThe location is very inviting the best front in the whole plaza meaby that is the reason that they are in business for almost 16 years and the groupon & restaurant.com \nPs the tinny sushi place next door was 130% to capacity...half hour waiting
