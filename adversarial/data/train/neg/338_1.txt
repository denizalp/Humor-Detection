Perla did my hair a while back but sadly I couldn't find her location and didn't bookmark the YELP ad... luckily I finally found her and I must say she is an amazing stylist. She made my hair color look so beautiful and she was also such a sweet kind women.  Now that I have found her contact again I will definitely be booking with her in the future.
