This place is horrible, I've never had an experience like this ever. First they told me they didn't have the car I reserved, then tried to charge me more to get a car I didn't even want. I was there for about two hours dealing with them and saw them do the same thing to several people. I eventually did get the car I reserved (a jeep with removable top) but the back window was broken and it was extremely inconvenient as the temp was around 115. Please choose another place to rent from!
