soooooooooooooo disappointed.  This location has good times and really bad times, last night around 7:00 pm was a really bad time.  As you can see in the picture the places was almost empty, stuff stacked all over the counter and signs saying they are out of lots of things like arby sauce?  we ordered four things and all were wrong.  Tried new brisket sandwich waited 15 minutes it came out cold, in a box the top of the bun was half off the sandwich there was only the equivalent of 4 pieces of meat a little dab of bbq sauce and four tiny little pieces of fried onion ring. OMG are you kidding me for almost 6$!  Not anywhere near the representation of the picture advertised I would say this is false advertisement! It was cold too!  The other sandwich was their new big brisket with belly bacon, it also was cold, it was greasy, it was very cold yukkkkkk!  Most of it went in the garbage.  We had a classic supreme medium size, they must have been short on meat because it was not more then a classic size of meat, terrible piece of lettuce leaf shoved in it, the meat was warm but the sandwich was cold.  Super disappointing for my favorite arby sandwich.  Did I say the lettuce omg it was so bad, inedible big leafy thing!  We had an order of potatoe cakes they must have been sitting someplace for 20 minutes, they were also cold, limp and uneatable.  I went to complain at the counter. nobody was there after standing there ten minutes we left.  I will not go back to this location again.  20$ spent on something not worth eating most of which we threw away.  I want my money back!
