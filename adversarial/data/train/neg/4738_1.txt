We decided to come here for brunch after being disappointed at another restaurant and it might be the greatest silver lining for us. The food and service were outstanding! We ordered chicken and waffles, fried blt sliders and a side of the biscuits. The fried chicken was heavenly. The skin was perfectly seasoned and crispy and the meat was so juicy and tender. The watermelon cubes, cheddar waffles and bourbon syrup were innovative and enjoyable. The sliders were texturally complex and the pork belly was flavorful as well. \n\nService was excellent and even a manager came by and cleared the table for us at the end. Highly recommend especially if you're near the Venetian.
