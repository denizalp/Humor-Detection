This bright and clean bakery can satisfy any sweet tooth you may have. The bakery is located in the middle of a slightly sketchy strip mall, but the bakery space is open and welcoming. Large cookie sheets of different pastries and sweets sit behind glass along a long counter. You pick from three sizes of take out containers (that look suspiciously like what you would get sushi in) and point to whatever may catch your fancy. The price is calculated by weight, so you can get as much or as little as you like. \n\nOnce you make your choice, you can grab one of the three small tables opposite the counter to devour your treat. The sweets were not as cloyingly sweet as I expected them to be. In fact, each piece had it's own unique texture, sweetness, and level of crunch. The different nuts used in each also brought something new to each piece, although some lent a more bitter flavor than I would have liked. I have no idea what any of them are called, but I liked the one that looks like the birdnest the most. A fun way to try some new pastries.
