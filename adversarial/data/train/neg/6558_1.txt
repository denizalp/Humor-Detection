I am editing my review and adding a star because of the owner's thoughtful and sincere response to my earlier posting. I really appreciate when a business owner takes the time to respond to online reviews and I would love to see this particular restaurant do well. As a vegan it means a lot to me when restaurants offer vegetarian alternatives. While my first experience wasn't the most positive, I can see that others have had much better experiences. It may have been an off day, so I will keep an open mind and maybe stop back the next time I'm in the area.
