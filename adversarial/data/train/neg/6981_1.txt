This place is a gem!!! Everything here is so delicious and fresh. No MSG and the best part, gluten free options! They offer multiple rice noodle dishes and if your a fan of spicy food as well, this is your place. My husband even loves it. This spot has become almost a weekly Sunday tradition. We've had the: Spring rolls, pork rolls, egg drop soup, Tom Yum soup, hot Korean stir fry, mushroom stir fry, the red curry,  green curry, yellow curry, bourbon chicken, crab puffs, chicken wings, and dragon noodles. Since we've tried just about everything on the menu, I can say our favorite dishes are the green curry, hot Korean, dragon noodles and both the spring and pork rolls! GO HERE!
