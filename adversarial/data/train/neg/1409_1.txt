We just showed up one Wednesday night and were impressed by this place. It was Wing Wednesday which was a pleasant surprise. Entrees were about $10 each, lots of HDTVs for the games, and a news ticker scrolling scores. The food was all good and worth returning for. I was glad that they weren't as obnoxiously loud as the place next door with the live music cranked up to 11.\n\nThe restaurant was clean and they had very nice bathrooms with floor to ceiling stalls with individual lights. I might be back for March Madness!
