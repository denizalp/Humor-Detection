Absolutely some of the best food I have ever eaten. Everything is always seasoned so wonderfully and the deviled eggs are absolutely to die for. My wife raves about this place and says it has some of the most fantastic seasonal dishes. Overall it is such a wonderful experience. I love the simplicity of the decor and minimalist approach to the overall ambience.
