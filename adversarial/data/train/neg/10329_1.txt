My experience at Right Toyota has been at most disappointing.  For starters, my oil change was greatly overpriced, and then the staff informs me that I may need a thousand dollars additional to repair something that was assessed based upon a deadline, rather than an actual issue identified, and also the appraiser for my vehicle was condescending, dismissive and rude in discounting my feedback pertaining to my vehicle appraisal.  Another staff member named Isaac at one point informed me that Toyota will give me either what I'm asking for, for the price of the vehicle, or they will come very close to it.  Well then he backtracks a couple of days later and says that he misunderstood in thinking I wanted a vehicle, when I was only in it for the money initially as I communicated to him.  When strolling around the dealership assessing the new vehicle inventory, I observed a very isolated and disconnected Toyota staff, which made the environment feel uncomfortable, unwelcoming and selfish.  I will not endorse Right Toyota as a quality dealership service provider...however Camelback Toyota was much more impressive and courteous!
