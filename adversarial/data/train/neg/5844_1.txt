Average for a Petco.  I buy some of the frozen raw food to mix with my dog's kibble, but this particular store disappointed me.\n\nI went to buy a bag of food on May 4, 2014.  Fortunately I checked the expiration date and found it expired in November 2013!  I understand some foods may expire as they sit on a shelf, but 6 months expired?  Yikes!
