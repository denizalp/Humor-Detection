The presentation matters just as much as the taste at Lumiere French Kitchen. All of the dishes are beautiful to look at and taste amazing. The escargot and the bread pudding were incredible. Service and overall atmosphere was excellent. Only reason it does not get 5\/5 is because of location.  It sits unassumingly in a strip mall.
