Wow, I did not expect this place to be this good.  The food was quickly prepared and everything was excellent(that we have tried so far.). Not a bean guy, so I can't say anything about them.  Service is friendly and willing to help.  Food says it's spicy, but honestly nothing to worry about if you enjoy Thai chilies.  I only wished they had their nutritional information written so I can keep track of myself, but the food is too good.  I'll try to work around it.  Highly recommend the chile relleno, machaca and the pollo Diablo.  If you are nearby, don't hesitate to give the place a try.
