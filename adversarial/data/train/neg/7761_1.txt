I've lived in the neighborhood pretty much all my life and can't remember ever giving Gabe's a try, so when we needed a breakfast spot this morning we gave them a gamble and they didn't disappoint at all! \n\nAs far as breakfast diners go, they have a great little menu that of course includes the classics, but also a couple of nice little creative spins like pumpkin bread French toast. We ordered a small smorgasbord of food and for $30 got a TON of food. The country burritos were excellent, and I highly recommend the Irish Potatocakes -- easily the highlight of the meal for me. \n\nOverall this place is definitely a step above the other typical neighborhood breakfast diners, I think. It is always PACKED on the weekends, and now I totally understand why.
