Had carry out pizza recently.  We were really happy with the pizza.  Crust, sauce, toppings, all great.  We ended up with one pizza with some toppings we didn't order, not things we didn't want, just didn't order.  I should have checked them in the store.  Had it not been for that minor item it would have been 5 stars.  Will get pizza from them again for sure.
