I will definitely be going back. I love the haircut. I explained what I wanted and the owner said he thought it would work with my hair and went with that, cutting it completely tailored to my \"cowlick\" (hate that word) etc rather than just doing a cookie cutter cut that wouldn't have worked exactly well. It was moderately priced, but well worth it.
