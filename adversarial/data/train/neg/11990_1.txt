We love the Venetian. The grand lux cafe has such great food and is reasonably priced. The pools are great. The casino floor has many great options for your gambling addictions. Rooms are very nice and comfortable. Only negatives....no coffee pot in the rooms and I don't like having a mini fridge I can't use since it's fully stocked on weighted sensors so if you take something out you are charged. It would be nice to be able to store your leftovers.
