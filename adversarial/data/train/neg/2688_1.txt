I have loved this place ever since my sister first brought these cupcakes home. That was roughly 6-7 years ago, and I'm still a huge fan of Swirls right to the point where I sometimes CRAVE them. My favorite cupcake is the raspberry beret. Their cupcakes are so fluffy and light with the icing so creamy and delicious. They have unique flavors like caramel latte, chocolate therapy, cookies n' dreams, red velvet and so many more. Their cakes are the same delicious quality like the cupcakes. The workers there are so kind and happy to serve you. Once you've tasted their cupcakes, you'll come back for more!
