Another review that is way overdue. I live down the street from Chino for years. The food and home cooking vibe is great. The fries rice and teriyaki chicken (white meat) are my favorite. My husband loves the Jerk chicken and rice but it's too spicy for me. If you like spicy he highly recommends you try the jerk chicken. Chino Bandido is a staple in our community. It's alway full of locals and everyone seems to like be the homie feel. It's definitely different not five start dining but it great food for a great price.
