As much as I wish I loved this place, I really didn't care for it. It was to over hyped especially with those fruit \"lattes\". We ordered the blueberry latte, watermelon latter, Nutella bread box and Nutella Gelato. The bread box and the ice cream was good. You can really taste the honey in the honey toast. The drinks were a flop. All they are is fruit syrup and milk for the strawberry and blueberry. Also they don't look like the pictures on here. They gave it to us in a plastic cup. The watermelon was actually just juice and milk. It wasn't worth the $6 each for me since I knew I could've gotten an actual latte instead.
