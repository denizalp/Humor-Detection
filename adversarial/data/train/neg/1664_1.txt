We will definitely be coming back to stay at the Silverton. For years we have been staying and gambling on the strip. Last time we were in Vegas we stumbled in here for the buffet. We stayed for the gambling experience. From the moment you arrive, every single employee is courteous, helpful, and friendly.\n\nHotel:    We arrived at 2 a.m., began gambling (and drinking) and by 6 a.m. we went to the front desk to see what time early check-in would be. She said they were booked solid, but found us a room and gave us the key, right then and there! No other hotel would ever do that. The lovely lady was so accomodating. The beds were comfortable, the room was spacious and very clean. Some people complain that they have older TV's....um....you don't come to Vegas to sit in your room and watch TV and if you do, the TV worked fine. Some complained about the internet charge. They have free wi-fi all over the casino. Once again, you don't come to Vegas to stay in your room.\n\nCasino:    Every single dealer we came across was very helpful and actually pretty funny. The cocktail waitresses came around frequently and actually remembered every order. Some dealers even took the time to help us learn craps. The comps are great! \n\nFood:      The buffet was decent. They have a great late night breakfast from 12am-5am. They have Johnny Rockets, Starbucks, and a few other eateries.\n\n I highly recommend this hotel and casino. Hands down, one of the friendliest places in Vegas. If you're going to be  \"donating\" money to a casino, might as well have a pleasant experience. Complainers, stay home.
