Okay, so I was really really excited about this girl. Her yelp reviews were great and her before and after pics were awesome. When she came to the room right on time to set up she got started with hair for my mom sister and myself. I explained that my sister and I wanted big curls and so she started putting our hair in pin curls and I wasn't too sure about that. Once she styled my moms hair she realized she FORGOT HER AIRBRUSH MACHINE! REALLY!!!!??? So im panicking and she was saying she can use regular makeup and just make it look airbrush....i know my face and i know airbrush would last all night and she said she would take $20 off for no airbrush, finally she got a-hold of someone to bring the airbrush machine to the hotel. That wasted time but regardless at least she got it there. My sisters hair was not even in curls but more of twisted waves....my hair the same with a bit more of a \"curl\" but bc we were running out of time I just said it was fine the way it was. Definitely could tell she does not have good experience styling hair...she is more of a makeup artist who tries to say she will style hair but I could have honestly done so much better. My hair did not stay in a curl and looked frizzy....i curl my hair alot and know how to use the right product to look great and i expected the same :( My face ended up looking more \"dewy\" then I wanted in my T-zone bc she said she used MAC face and body and that stuff is super dewy to begin with :( and my eye makeup was darker than i wanted so my eyes didn't pop like I've had done before.  My mom's eye liner rubbed off within one hour. She was also answering phone calls during appt no biggie but thats not professional. She was very nice and i hate that i had this experience with her!
