Leila and 2 of her amazing hair\/makeup artists made all my wedding dreams come true! They did hair and makeup for me (bride), 9 bridesmaids, and my mom, and everyone looked AMAZING! They were totally open to whatever we wanted, and had amazing tips and tricks I never would of thought of! I love that nobody looked like a crazy drag  queen -  we all looked like OURSELVES, just a little extra glammed up. And don't even get me started on how well our makeup photographed, BEYOND AMAZING! Leila and her team are professional, accommodating, and most importantly so skilled in what they do! Hire them and don't ever look back!!
