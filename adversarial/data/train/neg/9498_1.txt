I only a gave 1 star because zero is not an option. \n\nWe had a group of 12-15 and it was the worst. Tables didn't have silverware and we only had one server who was great and did the best being just her.  They should've assigned 2 servers.  We left kabukis to go to saddleranch to celebrate a 21st bday. The food took long and didn't have the right food. Someone in our party order salad and it tasted like dirt and there was a plastic piece in the salad. \n\nWe really will never go back.\n\nThe good - they gave is round of shots because it was bday and some dessert. That was really nice but it's hard to feel to good just cause service sucked.\n\nOur waitress was amazing and it sucked because management didn't recognize she needed help.  The other thing is she's the face of the restaurant and any bad service is reflected on her which I don't agree.
