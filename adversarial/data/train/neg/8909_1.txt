A hidden gem but it's worth the drive. Super and amazing friendly staff, really got a chance to know us and explain their menu. Got a free drink with our meal and also guarantee free burrito for your birthday. And the star of the show is their tacos! Amazing flavor! They also gave us free rice and beans to try out which is out of this world!
