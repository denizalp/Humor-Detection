This place was such a disappointment to be honest. I tried it because I work in the area and seafood is the only thing I can eat. I was feeling for something new and I heard positive things from my co-workers. \n\nAnyways, I walked in and it was empty which was a total bonus. Ordered the soft shell crab burger thing. It was done in 3 minutes, paid and walked out to work to get ready to devour this beautiful man made goodness.\n\nAnd that's not what happen. My crab was crazy small. The bun was HUGE and soggy as all hell. The lettuce wasn't cut either. My crab wasn't crunchy at all. It was soaked in oil. The fries were okay but I've had better. & the coleslaw? oh the coleslaw... it was bad. sorrynotsorry. \n\nI don't know how I feel about returning to this place. Maybe to try something else but this was a huge miss for me.
