The staff was OK but the woman dr had the bedside manner of Attila the Hun. I'm almost 70 years old and have NEVER been spoken to in the manner this woman spoke to me. The first time I met her she didn't bother to even take off her mask to speak to me. This time she asked me a question that I thought I was answering. Apparently NOT to her liking since with a snotty attitude she interrupted me and said Are you FINISHED TALKING?! If you are I will talk. No my vet treats animals better than this woman. VERY DISAPPOINTED THAT BANNER HAS THIS CALIBER.
