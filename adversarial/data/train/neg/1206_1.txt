We first had Roys in Kauai for our anniversary and loved it so much that we had to go back.\nwe celebrated my husband's birthday here and they just make it so special in the little things they do like personalized birthday message on each plate and printing out a picture of us! \nEvery dish tastes amazing, and my go to is the tuna filet. The flavors and presentation is on point and the dining experience is always positive!
