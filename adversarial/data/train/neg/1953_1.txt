I come to this Starbucks only when I come to the Costco. For the most part I like this store. It's clean, staff are friendly, and plenty of seating. The one thing I have noticed is the couple of gentlemen that do work here always get my order correct and I'm not having to repeat my order 3 or 4 times. The girls on the other had always seem a little scatter brained, I'm always having to repeat myself. My iced coffee is always made correct and made in a timely manner. Overall this store rocks!
