I had a great experience at this Hertz location. Lyanne was incredibly friendly and helped us with a mix up on our rental car (we had a \"guaranteed\" reservation for a Challenger, but there was a minivan in our spot ). Hertz is the only company we rent through. Their customer service is always top-notch, even at 11:00 pm!
