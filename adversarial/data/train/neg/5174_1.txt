Terrible service, disgusting food. Over priced . Waited for food for an hour , got my shrimp tostada and was disgusting , my buddy did not receive his food at all after waiting an hour . And in the process they brought food out for them selves and started eating . Found. If black hair in salsa . Looked pubescent .... Do not waste your time with this place , I won't be able to look at food again for awhile now I'm completely disgusted
