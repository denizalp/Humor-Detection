Pretty decent fried options. Many people get the salt and pepper chicken, but my personal favorite is the Thai chicken with rice. They recently revamped their menu so they offer ramen now! Also, they have a couple new menu items like the pork with duck yolk. In general, everything is just fried, so the taste is pretty strong. The rice helps diffuse the heaviness or the taste.\n\nI wouldn't say 5 stars because the service is just alright. They definitely leave you to your own devices and give you the check generally before you finish your dinner. The food is also definitely alright, but doesn't have the wow factor you would have for some restaurants. Perhaps, I may be wrong with their new food items though!
