We go to this theater frequently.  Not sure why this particular evening the manager was checking handbags.  Generally speaking if I was in NYC, LA, or SF, I'd understand & wouldn't feel like it was an imposition.  In this case, it just felt more like they were looking for if someone was sneaking in concessions.  I would understand that given they generally only open 1 side of the concessions even when the line is approaching the door.  W\/the ticket machine out of order, don't know if it wouldn't have been better served to have an extra person either at the tickets or opening concessions vs. standing next to the ticket taker searching hand bags or even tear the tickets as the person was issuing them & have the ticket taker & handbag searcher open an additional concession line.  This is our go to move theater & will continue to be due to our proximity.
