I've been a member of 1-2-1 for about four months.  Overall, the gym is okay.  It's pretty small.. all of the machines feel like they're right on top of each other and the TVs are shared and set at a weird angle.  There is a track, but b\/c it's so small it is deeply banked and I have never seen anyone use it.  It gets very hot and crowded and the interior is dark and gloomy.\nThere are several upsides, however.  All of the machines are well-maintained and fairly new.  The staff is friendly, and they offer four free personal training sessions when you first sign up.  There is free parking in a nearby garage.  The weight room is adequate and there are a few areas for stretching.  The classes are fun and also a good work out.  The lockers are free as well.\n\nIt isn't my favorite place to work out, but judging by what I've heard about other Cleveland gyms, this may be your best bet.
