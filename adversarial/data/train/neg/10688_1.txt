I decided to try this place for the convenience.  My customer was staying there and it was short notice.  We got right in.  They might have had 20% occupancy at 9pm which is pretty light for Vegas steakhouses.  My bone in Kansas Strip had a lot of gristle, especially for the price. Outback would have been a better choice.
