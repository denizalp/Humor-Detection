Bill Olmstead came highly recommended when I moved to the East Valley 8 years ago, and the experience was so positive that I've wholeheartedly recommended Bill & his team to others ever since. As a first-time home buyer, I deeply appreciated the Olmstead Team's help in understanding the whole buying process, as well as all of the help & patience they demonstrated in walking through it with my my wife and me. I was impressed with their knowledge of the local market as well as real estate trends in general, and I appreciated how they informed us about school options, traffic conditions, weather, landscaping and other peripheral aspects of home buying that really impact your family's experience once in a home. Best of all, they were genuinely interested in understanding our needs & desires, as well as our particular situation with regard to finances, timing, etc. and worked hard to help us find a place that we felt really good about.  And the service didn't stop there. The team has continued to serve us by kindly recommending vendors to help with repairs, renovations, etc. Whatever your real estate needs are in the East Valley area, you can trust that you will get the best service possible with the Bill Olmstead Team. I can't recommend them highly enough!
