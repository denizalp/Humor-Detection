I've been coming here for years! I love the tacky blue and pink Vegas Style diner with its maze-like booths and extensive menu.  The portions are huge and the rainbow-colored sugar is a great novelty.  The Fireside Lounge is a great relax place with the same perfectly tacky old Vegas set up.  It's open 24-hours too, so that's a plus.\n\nI chose 3 stars because, though the portions are large, the food is just okay.  I can't say anything here has ever Wow-ed me as far as food was concerned.  Furthermore, I don't believe I have ever received really good service on the dining side.  Most of the time, the servers are disinterested and not really that hospitable.  You food will come out when they have time to bring it and they will bring refills, side sauces, napkins, etc. when they can, but don't expect extra added niceties or say a local joint or service based restaurant. \n\nHowever, in the lounge, I have had some great experiences with friendly bartenders and servers (with the long black dresses on).
