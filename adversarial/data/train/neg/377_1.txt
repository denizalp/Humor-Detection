The service is pretty good. They are friendly and then just leave you to your meal.  Must be family run because they had their own table with their own food and belongings.\n\nFood came our fast and hot! It was really good too, first time in awhile I wanted to finish the entire broth. There was a good amount of noodles and meat also!\n\nOverall, a pretty good place to get Pho!
