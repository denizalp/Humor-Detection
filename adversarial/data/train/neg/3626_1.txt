It's so nice to have a Cuban place in Lawrenceville! I stopped in last week to order to-go and have a glass of wine while I waited. There were three other 2-top tables, a guy working the bar and the tables, as well as one cook in the kitchen. I ordered Empanadas appetizer, Cuban Sandwich, the Lechon Entree and Black Bean soup. I will say the Empanda is the tastiest I've ever had with a flakey, buttery crust...and that is saying a lot. The Cuban sandwich is by far one of the best in The Burgh, and the Lechon...mouth, dribble, watering. My only critiques...it took 45 minutes for my order, with three 2-tops, an already prepared meat (lechon) and a basic sandwich, seemed like a very long wait. Some better expediting in the kitchen would do wonders, as well as working on multiple orders at once. Also, I'd like to see an updated menu posted somewhere, anywhere, with the right perspective (check out their FB page). I would've given 5 stars, save for the very long wait. All in all though, I will order from there again and will continue to give props, 'cause the food is a slammin'.
