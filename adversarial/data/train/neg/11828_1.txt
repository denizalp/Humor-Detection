I had the most Amazing strawberry salad here. Everything was fresh and flavorful. The salad was a bit on the pricey side but it was worth every penny. It was huge and enough for either two people or two sittings. You wouldn't be disappointed with eating the food here. I did not dine in, I did a pickup order. So, I can not necessarily speak to the type of service they have.
