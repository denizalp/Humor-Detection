Taco Bell has always been a guilty pleasure of mine. Especially those chicken soft tacos! Love 'em!!\n\nSince moving into the area last May I've been here an average of 2-3 times a week. The service here is always friendly, and usually pretty fast. This place is much better than my former Taco Bell up on Craig Road.\n\nThe building is newer and the place always looks to be very clean. \n\nUntil I discover otherwise, I believe this is the best Taco Bell in Vegas!
