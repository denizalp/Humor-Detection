Wow. This place is horrendous. If you are considering trying Paramount Fine Foods Liberty Village I would strongly urge you to reconsider. There is absolutely nothing \"fine\" about the food at this place. Frankly it couldn't be further from \"fine\". The attention and care this place puts into the quality and taste of their food is about the same attention you would expect a heroin addict to pay to the cleanliness of the needle they use. I ordered a chicken shawarma plate with fries and a shish tawook plate with white rice. What little chicken there was among the pile of crap I got served was hard, cold, and dry as if it were a week old.    If I could give lower than a one star rating I would. Avoid at all costs.
