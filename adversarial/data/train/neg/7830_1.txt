Dined tonight at Kaya with 4 colleagues.  It was actually our 2nd attempt to eat here because the first time we did not make a reservation (big mistake).  This place is not very big and they draw huge business. Reservations are a must, even for 5:30pm on a Thursday.\n\nWe arrived during happy hour where everything from the bar is half off.  The drink list is outstanding.  They have a huge offering of cocktails, wines, and diverse beers (I had a great India Brown Ale).  This isn't too surprising because the bar takes up almost half the space of the entire restaurant.\n\nWe started off with the conch fritters and mango-tomatillo salsa which were both extremely flavorful.  Everyone at the table agree that the pulled pork quesadilla, the fish tacos, and the Kaya burger were excellent.  Our waiter was very attentive as well.  Prices were reasonable for what we had.\n\nOverall, Kaya is a great place for Caribbean fare.  Make sure you call for a reservation if you want a table (they're not on Opentable).  Compared to other Big Burrito restaurants, Kaya definitely appeals to a younger crowd. When we walked out it seemed like almost everyone in the place was under 25.  You may or may not view that as a good thing.
