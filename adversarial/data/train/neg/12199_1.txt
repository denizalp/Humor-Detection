Great location to stay at if you are going to the university!  You can walk to everything. \nValet parking a bit steep at $20\/day.  Rooms are clean and spacious and the staff is great, especially Kirk!  \n\nWould have given 5 stars except for the Bistro.  Love the idea of being able to have a bite to eat, but the hummus and \"crisp vegetables\" comes out with icky, old, gross vegetables.  It wouldn't take that much to give more than 2 carrot sticks that are fresh and 3 celery sticks that have been in the refrigerator too long.  The Bistro in general needs something, like time management skills.  I have been here several times and it seems like there is only one person working who has to do everything which results in waiting a long time no matter what time or what meal you are there for.
