This is my favourite escape game location in Toronto. I have play most of their missions and they are all really well made. You can tell that the team puts alot of effort into creating these games, from the gadgets, to puzzles and storylines, these games have it all. \n\nMy favourite one is the Syndicate Relic - this one is full of really cool mechanism and gadgets. Involves a lot of team work and attention to detail. I felt really immersed into the story line.\n\nIf you like horror type - Unknown, Noriko and Crossroads are good games and the bleak prison is really well made as well and requires teamwork.\n\nOnce you've been to Escape Games, no other location really compares.
