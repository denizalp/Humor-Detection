To be honest, I was a bit disappointed. Had the original philly, but it was so bland, I even needed to add a bit of salt to bring out the flavor of the red sauce. Note: the sauce is not at all spicy. Ill say, they ensure to keep the food warm even for pick up, so thats nice, the cheese was still hot when I had it at home. Also the people are really polite and nice. But not a place ill be trying anytime soon.
