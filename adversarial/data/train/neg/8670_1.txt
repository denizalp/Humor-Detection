Great club from what I remember, but the bartender had no problem giving 1 customer 4 beers (only in Vegas).  When I went to give 2 of them to my buddy he had decided to cut himself off (we had been drinking since our plane got in at 3 in the afternoon).  So there I was.  With 4 beers.  I drank them all the rest of the night is highlights ending with me in the bushes out front.  \n\nI hope to return someday and check it out again!
