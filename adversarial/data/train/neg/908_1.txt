This is such a great concert venue and piano studio. They have a beautiful selection of pianos and an open and beautiful space for concerts. We have attended two events and both were amazing. The owner of the store Michael is professional and present in the studio daily. He is friendly and incredibly knowledgeable and prices are fair. If you're looking for a new piano or want to book a concert or small event, I would highly recommend Stilwell Pianos! Support local businesses!
