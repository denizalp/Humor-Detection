Wow. This place has excellent customer service and are really great at making you feel welcome. Especially a newbie. The food is very delicious and fresh made. I tried the market salad with some turkey meatballs. Both were delicious. Very flavorful, fresh and healthy. I wish there was one in my two homes- Houston, Tx and St Pete, Fl!
