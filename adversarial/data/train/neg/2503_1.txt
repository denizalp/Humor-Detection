Hey all, my 5 star is solely based on the food. I've visited at various times during the day and it seems run well enough, and though it seems to have a fairly large group of regulars it really doesn't bother me, but I know that that could turn some patrons off. HOWEVER, as a Chicagoian who values quality food I can honestly say that Jolies has a menu that's unrivaled in the valley. I've easily tried half a dozen dishes and everything was MUCH better than I expected. The service is always good, and it's easy to flag down a server when things get busy and they seem on top of it. So thanks, Jolie's, for being a place that's been reliably good.
