I called all around.  I got 6 estimates on my yard. Catci came in WAY under all the other guys...but they far exceeded my expectations.  Fast, professional service.  They take pride in their work and it shows.  I'm so glad I chose them!  Honestly, I chose them for the price, but I'll stay with them for the quality. (two thumbs up!!)
