Being a native eastsider I was a little upset when my parents picked up and moved to the far westside while I was at school ( a little notice huh?). Anyway since there move I've needed to find some new \"local\" places for my visits home. Rush Inn looks a little bit like a newly built dive bar but that is part of the charm. That and the exceptional bar food. I'm not usually a wing fan but their extra large \"Rush Inn\" wings are out of this world (my favorite anywhere). Only down side is as a limited meat eater (with a vegetarian father) they have removed some of my favorite items from the menu (bring back the lobster ravioli and portobello mushroom!) Really nice outdoor patio in the summer too.
