This was a good experience all around. The Decor is bright and fun and the restaurant is surprisingly large for being a storefront. We went at dinner on Friday and despite being busy we didn't have to wait. We sat by the bar and were greeted quickly with chips and salsa and and drinks were ordered and delivered. I got the Burritos Ranchero for dinner and my girlfriend got the Carnitas. Despite the food taking a little while(busy Friday) it was delivered hot and everything was delicious! I highly recommend both dishes. They gave us so many jalape√±os with the Carnitas and the ranchero sauce was awesome!
