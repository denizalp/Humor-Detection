Should I start by saying I despise going to the gym? Ontop of that I had a crap experience at the 32nd St\/Greenway location (see that review).. But I must say I am very happy here. You get 2 Personal Fitness consults when you join and they put me with Alison. #1 Its a good idea to put someone with your frame but in better shape than you..its like working out with the future you. lol She was cute and bubbly and she pushed me, wrote down the number of every machine, the number my seat was, the weight, the reps and sets on my little blue card. The purpose of this is so when you come in on your own, you can grab your card and easily find the machines you need and the settings without having to spend a bunch of time trying to figure it out again. LA Fitness and Golds Gym will NEVER pay this much attention to you unless you are paying for the Personal Trainer pkg! Pure Fitness just seems more invested in their clients. They do try to encourage you to utilize their personal trainers by buying one on one time but it's not an overbearing hard sell. The prices are fantastic though. At least half of the other 2 gyms I mentioned. I hate gyms but I can't complain about this one, not at all.
