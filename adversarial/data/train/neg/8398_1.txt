best thai restaurant in phoenix by far!!!!\nit's crazy, because this place is in sun city and you would probably not wonder in just by looks, but believe me, it is amazing!!!\n\ni'm from chicago and have had great thai food. this is the best!!!\ntry the #66 ( peanut sauce) with chicken and #65\n( yellow curry)\n\nenjoy, and ask for ying. she is fun, funny and will steer you in the right direction!
