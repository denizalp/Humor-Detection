This place just doesn't cut the mustard. It's too expensive, too crowded and just not that great. It's OK food. But really, I think it's pretty basic Mexican food served on nice plates with a higher price. I think two of us spent $40 for lunch, sharing something. Service is slow too. I'd love to stop in for a quick drink, late night, but it's always too swamped. I think they have a great location, which is why it's always too busy. They nickel and dime for everything in here, so don't order anything out of the ordinary. If the prices were 1\/2 to 1\/3 of what they charge, I'd return. Otherwise, no thanks. I do recommend T'n'T over at Luxor. That place was surprisingly good and I thought, much cheaper. I also recommend Isla at TI and Taqueria Canonita at The Venetian. Unfortunately, Margaritas at The Frontier is obviously gone, or I'd recommend that, as well. Anyway, keep looking, this place just isn't worth it.
