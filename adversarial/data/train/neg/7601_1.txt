Went with my girl, it's a female makeup store... so here is a take from a guys point of view. The shop was good and they had a lot of quality brands. The service was great as there was lady in every section and they were willing to help her. The good thing was that you don't have to buy the product at first if you are unsure that it would suit you or not. They provide product samples come back and buy it if it suits your skin.
