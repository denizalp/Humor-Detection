Considering the location in The Venetian, on The Strip where everything is grossly overpriced, I think only the most jaded Chinese food super critic could give this place less than 4 stars.\n\nThere are VERY FEW places ON THE STRIP in one of the MAJOR HOTELS that isn't a complete rip-off (aside from the Food Court places.)  This is one of those very few.  We had Hot and Sour Soup, Stir Fried Soft Noodles with BBQ Pork, Mu Shu Pork, Chicken Pineapple Fried Rice, Brocolli Beef. Not the best Chinese food I've had, definitely, but solid, good Chinese food.  The beef in the broccoli beef was a bit fatty so I wouldn't recommend that one.  Best of all, portions were large enough for the 3 adults and two teens to share family style and we were stuffed with a little leftovers at the end.  And for The Strip, prices were very reasonable - most in the $13-17 range so with beverages (two of them alcoholic) the bill for the 5 of us was under $100 (not including tip.) Practically unheard of on the strip for in-hotel semi-upscale dining.  Service was good too, although the place was only about 1\/3 full when we ate there so YMMV.\n\nThe atmosphere of the place is semi-upscale casual and it's in the casino with a nice view of the screens in the sport book through huge glass windows so bonus you can watch the game(s) while eating. One of the better finds I've discovered on the strip.
