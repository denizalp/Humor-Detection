Small ramen shop that is a little hidden from the main area and traffic. If you are trying to spot it off the street you will not see it. The staff (only 1 serving) was pretty friendly. The menu was a little disappointing as someone has also mentioned that a lot of the items were crossed out. \n\nI have ordered the House tonkotsu ramen which was a little less salty. The flavour was ok nothing too impressive but it did taste a little different than what I am used to. The egg was a soft boiled egg rather than a traditional Japanese pickled egg. The price was decent, most ramen were between the $9-11 range so it wasn't  overpriced like the other bigger places. \n\nWould I come back? Maybe, definitely it is not like your typical ramen chain.
