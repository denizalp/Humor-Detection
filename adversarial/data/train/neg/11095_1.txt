Me and the fam were excited to try it w so many great reviews. It's a fancy place, it didn't feel like a bakery to me. I guess it's because their main focus are cakes. \n\nWhat we got:\nMonster Cookie- It sounded good when she explained it to me, m&m's with PB and oatmeal w chocolate chips. (I know what was I thinking?) I took one bite and couldn't finish. Super dense and sweet w way too much PB\n\nChoc\/chip Macaroon - my kid got this, she didn't want to finish it which says a lot since she loves sweets. Me and my mom couldn't believe how sweet and gooey it was. No thanks.  Smaller macaroons would probably have a better texture & be more enjoyable....just my opinion.\n\nChoc\/Coconut frosted Cupcake - Kinda dry & the icing tasted artificial. I prefer Cupcakery or sprinkles at the linq no doubt.\n\nNo desire to go back for any baked goods they have. :\/
