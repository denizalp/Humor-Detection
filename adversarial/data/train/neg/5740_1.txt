8\/19\/16- Update:  AC decided to give me problems tonight.  Called Bakers at 7:30 pm and doorbell rang by 8.   1 run capacitor later, I've got nice cold AC again.  Highly recommend.....again.\n\n\nTurned my furnace on (gas) and it set off the smoke detectors.  Googled heating\/AC service for Surprise and got a list.  Baker was the third call and only company to actually answer the phone.  Asked Ken if he could take a look at it Monday (called Friday afternoon).  Ken said he could look at it same day and called in advance.\n\nHe serviced the system and furnace running fine.  Just needed cleaning of the AC coil.  Fast, friendly and professional.  Highly recommend.
