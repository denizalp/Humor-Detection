First time here was for my Hubby's bday we got a day bed and rocked out.  Amazing!\nSecond time was for a bachelorette.  Rain Rain go away! Rains like 3 times a year in LV and i swear it rain all Three days we were there!  Poured the day we went to Encore BEach Club to see Kaskade.  Crowd is young and half naked!  Our bottle girl was gorgeous!  Music is pumping! and the Pool and decor looks like a resort.  Day beds all around the pool and lily pads in the pool.  Cabanas all around the outside.  Even a second layer of cabanas.  Love this place.  One of the best pool parties in Vegas
