Three stars might even be generous...totally underwhelming. I do not understand the hype over this place. The buttermilk biscuit was bland. I will say, the maple butter that came with it was very tasty. I wouldn't have eaten as much of the biscuit as I had without it. I also got the Fairfax as did my husband as well as the Slut. The Slut was the best item but even that was underwhelming and pretty bland, not to mention small. The siracha mayo on the Fairfax was tasty but I could've made this sandwich at home. In my opinion, this place is not worth the hype or the price.
