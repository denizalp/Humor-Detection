TLDR: great selection of brews on a pretty wooden terrace.\n\nThis nice bar is situated on St Laurent and hosts a nice wooden terrace in the summer. The hostess let us have our pick of seating and we served promptly and kindly.\n\nBirra had a great selection of beers, draft, bottled, and imported, to chose from. I selected a light and refreshing pint of draft St Ambroise hibiscus beer, which coupled well with the lovely atmosphere.\n\nTheir food menu looked appetising, and I may come back to give it a try.\n\nIf you're looking for someplace fun to grab a pint in the are, you can trust Birra to provide.
