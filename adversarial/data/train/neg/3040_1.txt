Extremely good food!  I ordered about 6 or 7 different items including an entree which was stew chicken and everything was phenomenal.  I've always seen the groupon and scrolled past it but today my gf and I decided to give it a shot. Great atmosphere and ridiculous food.  Literally the best meal I've had in months. I would recommend to everyone.
