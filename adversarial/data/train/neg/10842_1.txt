YUM!! Tried this place out on a whim and I was not disappointed. The food was delish! I was really impressed with the kitchen staff. A friend of mine had asked for a sauce to accompany her meal that they didn't make. The waitress apologized and it was no big deal. A couple minutes later the waitress returned with a custom, freshly made sauce that was exactly what my friend had been looking for. The chef in the back made it on the spot specifically for her! Overall, enjoyed this spot very much.
