It was a pleasure and a relief to deal with Beth at Amre Supply. It was unfortunate that I had to go through a call centre to get through to the actual store...but when I finally did, service was perfect. Beth went out of her way to answer my questions, ascertain what part I needed for an extraction fan, and had the correct part ordered within two hours. I received it the next day.\nIt will be my first stop for any future appliance conundrums. Why would i subject myself to indifferent service and limited selection somewhere else?\ncsj
