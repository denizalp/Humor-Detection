I would give this location a 10 out 10 if I could. They are the best. I have an Audi Q5 and they did an oil change a few months back. Then I needed brakes so I stopped by and spoke with Thad. He runs this store and is the best mechanic. He said he could put new brakes and routers on my Q5. He ordered OEM parts from Audi. Which I requested. Picked them up for me and did an incredible job. I would recommend using them and ask for Thad. Also Mia who works there is awesome and they just treat customers right! I'm a forever customer.
