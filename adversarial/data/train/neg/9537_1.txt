Four of us dined here for lunch this afternoon. including the appetizer it was around $120.00. This was 2 steak specials, smothered chicken, and a salmon dish (entrees included salad and a side). The food quality was all good, except for the onion appetizer which was dripping with grease and harder to eat then you're standard steakhouse onion plate. Mashed potatoes were good... saut√©ed muchrooms and onions were good... two steak eaters were happy (though not over the moon). Smothered chicken was flavorful and salmon was \"pretty okay\". And our waiter was a nice guy, cracked a few jokes, and had fun with us. So in the end it's pretty much the definition of a 3 out of 5. It wasn't bad really. It just wasn't anything too special. If I had a choice, I'd probably do Longhorn instead - especially based on the price.
