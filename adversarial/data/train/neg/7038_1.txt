Love this place! Got married here last year and the changes in the past few months are AMAZING! The room was clean, staff was extremely friendly and the casino and Catalyst bar were packed full of people all week. LOVE the dealertainers, we had a blast watching them! Location is prime on the strip and we loved being so close to everything, and so close to our hotel at the end of the night! Everyone seems to be complaining about the construction, you know they're renovating the place, so if it bothers you GO SOMEWHERE ELSE! I'm excited to see the changes, and can't wait to go back.\n\nBonus: The Quad Wine and Spirit store right by the Catalyst bar has AMAZING prices on beer!
