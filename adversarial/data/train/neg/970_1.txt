Update: I called the store and was on hold long enough to get dressed, get in my car, drive to the store, and still be on hold. Absolutely ridiculous. If you ask when shipments come in you get every day of the week as an answer, yet yet they never seem to have the product when you do come in on the confirmed shipment date.
