This is my go-to theater since I have MoviePass but today, both of their downstairs soda machines were out of order so guests had to walk upstairs to fill their drinks, then walk back down if their movie was downstairs. The soda machine upstairs also didn't have any flavors or the normal selection of regular soda. I'll keep coming here but today's visit was kind of disappointing!
