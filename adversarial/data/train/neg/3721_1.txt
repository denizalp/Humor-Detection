Formerly called \"Buffalo Bill's\" this is the same fantastic place that I have been shopping at for the seven years I snow-bird in Arizona.  Do NOT just visit one building---there are two different buildings, parking lots separated by a third site that you will want to visit.  Rustic to the point of junky, this place is FILLED with real treasures hidden among the rest. You will not get dusty in the furniture store and you definitely will want to wash your hands at the home decor store. When we leave AZ for good, I am sure I will come back here just to shop at Retablo--cannot find this stuff anywhere else!
