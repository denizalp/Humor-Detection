I was a little reluctant to try this buffet due to the price of dinner ($30), but it was money well spent! The food was nothing short of delicious!! There was a station for every type of food you could imagine. I particularly enjoyed the pasta station and the Chinese food. They also had a plethora of fruit and veggies that were fresh and in season. The deserts were amazing! So glad we came here and will most definitely be back on our next trip!!
