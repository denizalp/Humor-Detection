Easy to make an appointment.  I was in and out pretty quickly.  Dr. Little put me at ease immediately.  His bedside manner is the best!  I went in for what I thought was a stye on my eyelid.  Ended up being a name I couldn't pronounce, but Dr. Little explained it to me and how to care for it.  He didn't push me into any invasive procedures, but offered the alternative, if I needed it.  After going home and doing what he said, it has pretty much taken care of itself.  If I do need the procedure later, I will definitely go back.  The office was clean and the staff was professional.  I would definitely recommend Nevada Eye Care and Dr. Little, especially.  Hard to find a doc that has a sense of humor.
