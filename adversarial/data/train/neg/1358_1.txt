The food is DELICIOUS and I come here quite often or order for take out. One thing that they do need to work on is the customer service.  I will be honest the customer service SUCKS!!!! The food is so good you barely pay attention to it, but when you are hungry or thirsty you shouldn't have to locate your server. On top of that the server never says for ex: \"Hi I'm Ben\" instead they just come and say are you ready to order or you have to say excuse me to whoever is walking by.  For that I give this place 3 stars because the service should match the beautiful restaurant.  Sometimes the staff is rude and barely acknowledge you, well most of the times. If the staff were more friendlier and more aware that different cultures are there to enhance their tastings with good Chinese Food, then I would give it 5-Stars.  I will admit the food is 5-Stars.  I recommend this place to anyone. It truly is a hidden gem with the ability to be 5-Stars.  I am headed there now to take out my girlfriend and mom for mother's day.
