We decided to try the Hash House A Go Go for a third time. Our previous two experiences were very disappointing so I thought \" Third Time is a Charm\". I was mistaken! The service from our waiters were excellent. But we ordered eggs cooked medium and they were severely under cooked. So the waiter brought back a new order for my Mother. I chose to just not have a new order,   Didn't eat my eggs. Her 2nd order came back over cooked this time. Wow, she suffered the two extremes. Now I had the waffle breakfast with two eggs. Remember I didn't eat my runny eggs. I love waffles. So I was extra disappointed when my waffle was rubbery. The Pros are the manager and waiters were very nice.
