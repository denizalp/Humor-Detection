5 stars for what it's worth, loud music, simple bar food and cheap drinks! We were given complimentary shots because our server thought she had us waiting too long. \n\nSame concept as warehouse\/el furniture. Somewhere to go if you're not looking for anything spectacular or fancy just comfortable and simple but good.
