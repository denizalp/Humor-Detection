Good stuff, a real non-chain Mexican food joint. The chile relleno was one of the best ever & the al pastor tacos too - genuine shepherd-style carne. Quick in & out place; decent prices, clean, small but nice salsa bar. My single wish: true aguas fresca (they have the instant mix stuff, meh), but they do carry a good selection of Mexican sodas, including apple & the strange but delicious no-alcohol carbonated sangria.\n\nGreat place, I'll definitely be back.
