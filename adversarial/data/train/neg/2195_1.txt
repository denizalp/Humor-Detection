The star rating states \"Meh\" and Meh is about right.  I met friends here on a Friday night.  It was VERY loud.  We were glad outdoor patio seating was available because inside was too loud to be able to actually carry on a conversation.  \nIt was clear the waitress was more interested in the bachelorette and birthday party tables near us then our little table of four.  \nFood is very pricey for what you get.  I ordered a shrimp appetizer and it was very clear they were frozen and low quality shrimp thawed and tossed on some poor quality salad.  The tortilla soup was pretty tasty, but not worth the price.  \nDrinks were extremely expensive for what you got.  My sangria was $10 and was very watered down.  The same glass at most other bars would have been half the price.\nOverall, there are so many places that are much better than Bar Louie, even right in Station Square.  Do yourself a favor and visit one of those places instead.
