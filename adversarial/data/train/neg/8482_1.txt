Checked out Burger Habit for lunch with my husband and son. Right away we noticed the friendly staff helping the customers. There were two senior ladies who needed a little extra help and the staff went out of their way to accommodate them. We also had two managers ask us about our lunch as we ate. When the senior ladies were leaving the manager not only walked them out, held the door asked about their meal but then proceeded to walk them to their car and hold open the door. I will definitely return to this establishment for the customer service and bonus - the food was good!
