The only reason this place get only 4 stars is because no matter where or when u go. It's a big line. I know they cook it fresh to death. And its not as bad as other fastfood places forsure. At least they try to make things fastee with the person walking outsise takin orders. But still.... The burgers are worth it. The fries are freshly cut in front of you. And you can make it anyway you want it. The only thing bad is the wait.
