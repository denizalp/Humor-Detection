An okay, not great, place on the Westside for Midwesterners to get a Coney fix. Second time eating here, first time in 2 years. No particular reason for the length of time. Both dining experiences were the Detroit style coney islands. Service was friendly. Obviously a family-run restaurant. I didn't have to pay until I was finished eating. Nice sized TV to watch. There was a pesky fly buzzing around. However the restaurant and restroom was clean. Overall, it was good for Phoenix but not for Detroit. I found the flavor of the chili somewhat lacking. I will return and it won't take another 2 years.
