My wife and I went here for our anniversary!!!  We both got the scallop dish. The salad we had was way over dressed!  The scallops all had different cooks on them. There were some that were raw (seared on 1 side) some were way over cooked (seared on both sides) some super over cooked (seared on 3 sides). Both dishes were served with RAW kale. If you have ever had raw kale it is super crunchy and does not taste very good.  But if we had to pick the best thing on our $50 each dish it would of been the RAW kale.  When we got our check, our drink prices were all 5-8 dollars more expensive than what was listed on their drink menu..  When I pointed it out to one of our waiters they told the manager. However when he came back he told me that once something is rung up they can't change the price on something.  I went ahead and paid because I did not want to give our anniversary a bad energy.   I would not recommend this place to my worst enemy. If you do go check the prices on the menu and make sure that is what they charge you!!! If I could give a zero star I would.
