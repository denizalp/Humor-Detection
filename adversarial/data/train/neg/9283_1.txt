Al Wagner is patient, knowledgable, professional, and thankfully... he has a great sense of humor. I needed all of these qualities in my search for advice with the IRS problems I have created for myself. He discussed all of my options with me and gave me the pros and cons of each. He dumbed it down so I can make the best informed choice on how to move forward. I would definitely recommend him for tax services and advice, and new business startup support.
