Obsessed!!!! That's pretty much all I can say! I absolutely love these classes the studio and Kassel. I never though I would get back to the shape I'm in these classes kick your butt but are so fun that you don't even notice your working out until the next day when you can't move lol. I look forward to going to classes each week I've never felt that way about \"working out\" so if you need to find something that motivates you to get up and is also a complete blast you need to check out Desert Air yoga!
