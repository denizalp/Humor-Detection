I really hope the Owner Jay reads this. This is a salad place, they make salads. Shouldn't be that hard. Our office has been coming here for 4 years, and finally decided to say something. First, the staff..they have 1 good employee, the rest are lazy and just don't care. No pride in doing their job. The house dressing is different each and every time I order it. Somet times it is thin, sometimes gelatinous, and some times just oily with no flavor.  Brown lettuce? Why can't the lettuce be fresh and crisp. I don't want brown lettuce and those hard white parts either. The place is dirty, clean it up. PLEASE, be a salad place and provide the one thing you specialize in...SALADS!
