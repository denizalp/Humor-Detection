ive never tried any malaysian food before this so my review may be a little bias but i LOVED their curry so so SO much ! i love the food here, but the bf thinks its pretty overpriced for asian food esp in that area . \n\ndont go here expecting good, or even average, service when if you go during the busy hours . the servers aren't the friendliest but they definitely dont go out of their way just to make your meal unpleasant . to me, it seems like theyre just doing their job and nothing more, nothing less . \n\nalso, they close really early on tuesdays . i dont know if that's the case anymore but once i came all the way from north york after work, DURING rush hr, cuz i wanted the food so bad but they were closed when i got there . :( i left them a note and shoved it in the gap of their door cuz i was so disappointed . i dunno if they got it or not . =P
