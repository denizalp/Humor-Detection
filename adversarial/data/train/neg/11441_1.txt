It's a close by place for me to have lunch\/brunch. You get lots of good options - healthy and yummy!\nIf Phoenix weather allows you to sit outside, on a lazy Sunday, the patio sitting with sprinklers makes Sunday brunch just wow!\nI like the freshly brewed coffee with hazelnut milk and Italian wedding soup! Their frittata rustica is also really good!\nThe only negative I would say is the slow service. It could be really really slow! Other than that, I love this place!!
