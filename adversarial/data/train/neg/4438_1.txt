Not going to lie, I'm a total geek for the $5 carry out deal. I have come to this location on more occasions than I care to admit. I have had a great experience 9\/10 times. I have noticed that if I call ahead just ten or fifteen minutes I tend to get a fresh pizza instead of one that's been sitting in the heater. \n\nI personally find the staff to be friendly and if you engage in conversation you can certainly make some friends. They always hook me up with a few extra Zap Packs (Little Caesar's seasoning). \n\nI don't understand the bad reviews at this location, the service is quick and the pizzas are usually fresh. Again if you just call ten minutes in advanced you will get a much better pizza right out of the oven. \n\nThis isn't a fine dining establishment, so let's be realistic with our expectations people. It's a five dollar pizza with plenty of flavor and a overall impressive value.
