Bought a pair of running shoes from Road Runner Sports one year ago and declined the VIP club offer.  Then I looked at my credit card statement this month and they arbitrarily charged my card $27.99 for an annual VIP Club membership.  I called the 800# and was told the charge would be credited and the membership (which I never requested) would be canceled.  I went online and found that this is a standard practice by RRS.  This to me, is a fraudulent business practice.  I will never shop here again.  I cannot support a business with this kind of practice.  There are too many other companies who offer the same products without fraudulently charging their customers for a renewal fee they never agreed to.
