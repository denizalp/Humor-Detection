They got some good stuff going for them including a few toppings I've never seen before.  I had no idea \"strawberry boba\" or \"passion fruit boba\" ever existed..  But it wasn't really like boba at all!  It was more like fruity salmon roe with how it popped in my mouth.  Really wild!  At least as wild as self serve frozen yogurt gets. \n\nMy ONLY gripe was that the yogurt itself got pretty runny really quick.  Turn down the temperature a bit in the fridge?  I got the cake batter\/red velvet combo which tasted great until it turned into liquid in about 2 minutes.  It would've been great otherwise.
