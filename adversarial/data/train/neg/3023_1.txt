Food was good. Drinks were good as well. Service was prompt and the ladies were lovely . The live band on Saturday nights is way, WAY too loud. The volume is high enough for a venue 5x the size of this place for maybe 30 people. Couldn't even hear the poor waitress. Should pay extra for lip reading. \n\nGood for late night food though.
