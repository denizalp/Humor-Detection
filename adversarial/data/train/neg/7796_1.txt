Booked a night on hotwire for 80 dollars. Thought it was a good location but must say that the management at this location was completely unprofessional. After an evening in Toronto, we returned to our room to find that our key card would not work. Someone from the front desk then attempted to open the door and could not. We were then told that the only solution was to wait until 8 AM until a maintenance crew could come in. All our possessions (including vital medications) were thus locked away from us and we were powerless to do anything about it. We were then downgraded to a room with a single bed (our initial room had 2 queens). When trying to complain about our situation, we found the entire staff rude and unprofessional and unwilling to listen to our pleas to obtain our items. I have stayed at multiple Hilton Garden Inns and have used hotwire\/priceline numerous times before and have never been subject to such treatment.
