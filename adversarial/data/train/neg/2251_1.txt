The dishes always come out quick and they are always prepared well. Dishes can easily be adjusted to your liking as well. Never like hunting for tables during busy lunch times, but that happens at just about any good lunch spot, so no real complaint. Having a super Coke machines is nice addition as well. How else can you get a diet cherry Fanta?
