I do not even go to ASU (yet) and I have been to this pizza place several times. I have never had a bad experience and the pizza is perfect every single time. I love that I can choose my own toppings and that they put a decent amount of each topping. I love that they are so quick at making it too. The people working here are so nice and helpful. I'm becoming a Sun Devil this fall and I cannot wait to come there more often.
