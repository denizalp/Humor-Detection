I purchased a groupon for a dozen cupcakes. I was sorely disappointed when I went in and saw the selection available. They told me I would need to put in an order for \"chocolate\". As I was planning on bringing these cupcakes to a special event, I left and purchased full price at the Cupcakery. The quality does not compare! I could make the same at home.
