Jade Palace is a delight. The food quality is exceptional and the service is top notch. The owner Davlen knows his wine and has a great selection of wines in his very large wine cooler. The food is not your typical Chinese restaurant. It is a high end restaurant with very reasonable pricing.\n\nDefinitely worth it!!
