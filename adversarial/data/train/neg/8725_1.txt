I can't get enough of Wildflower Bread Company! Can you tell?\nDid you know they use wild Alaskan salmon in their salads,etc? \nDid you know they use cage-free, antibiotic-free, hormone-free chicken in their chicken dishes? \nAlways very fresh, always consistent, delicious food--and that's as close to perfect as a restaurant can get! \nI finally tried something a little different today: 1\/2 roast beef and gorgonzola sandwich and 1\/2 Caesar salad...FABULOUS! Every bite was pure deliciousness! \nAlthough I'm trying to cut the sweets, I'm going to indulge in a cupcake or a piece of cake next visit....they look wonderful, as well! \nThis place ROCKS!
