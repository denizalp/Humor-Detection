the manager ASKS CUSTOMERS TO TAKE DOWN BAD REVIEWS and offers to return money to them outside the insurance process for doing so!! read other reviews that state this!! this is why this company has 4 stars...they PAY PEOPLE TO TAKE DOWN BAD REVIEWS and would not refund us any money, likely since we did not.\n\nSee photos of unassembled furniture, home left a mess, tons of broken items and boxes (which were brand new!!) completely trashed and broken open with out stuff falling out. \n\n\nThe  responses added by management are completely false.  The company basically held my items hostage unless I paid to transfer to another truck, which was completely unnecessary; we asked for this fee returned and to compensate us for not completing the job. This has nothing to do with the damages, which we filed with third party.
