I got the large Ninja signature bowl tonight and I have to say it was only ok. For the price, it wasn't as big as other bowls I've had.  I wasn't the biggest fan of wasabi peas on it either but that's personal preference. \n\nFor the price\/portions, I'm more likely to go to any of the Korean restaurants in the area next time.
