Came here twice and love it. They usually have 3-4 daily specials at $7.99 which comes with a soup and hot drink ($1.00 extra for cold). From 2:30pm to I think 5pm they have afternoon specials. However the menu is on a board on the wall and its hard to see. They dont have the specials on the actual menus. Service is pretty good for hk style. Cash only.
