Came here on a Saturday brunch and was a little surprised that it wasn't  packed. I haven't  been tona Coras in a few years but the one that I have been to was packed and need to line up to get a seat. Once seated the waitress seems to be rushing us to order which I don't  get why because it wasn't  packed anyway. There was this constant pressure to order and get going. Finally ordered the Rosemary's Sunday and was a little dissapointed in terms of the proportions. My memories of Coras is that they offer a lot of fruit on the plate and it seems like I barely got any. The overall food quality was average nothing too spectacular. Not sure if I would want to come back to this location.
