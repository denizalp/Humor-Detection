Thai foods are always my favorites. As this place serves halal meat, I always go to this spot without thinking anything. I almost tried their all menus. Love the flavours of different herbs. My favourite dish is Pad or Mao and Khao soi, also Holy Basil Chicken!! \nBut this place is very congested and cozy. Nowadays I have been observed new staffs and customer service isn't good anymore. Today I received no smile at all and been treated like they are saying Eat and Go kinda attitude! Very disappointing..
