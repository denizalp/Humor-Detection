Pai's Thai line was out the door so this was our backup and on our way back to our hotel room.\nCup Jamaican spinach salad, super food salad with the house dressing and the corn bread combo. I got the all start salad with the house dressing.\nI like the warmth of this place at night, the lightning is perfect and so posh yet cool and fun with the mismatched chandeliers. \nThe back bench seems rather tight, trying to cram as many people against the back wall than is suitable or comfortable, requiring petite and small folks to still be careful as the ingress egress is narrow. \nThe Jamaican spinach soup wasn't bad and had some kick to it, the house salad and corn bread looked nicely toasted. My husband said his food was good. My bowl was teeming with micro power greens, goji berries, kale, quinoa, cherry heirloom tomatoes, cubes of cucumbers, sunflower sprouts, adzuki beans, parsley, mixed nuts, thick cut sweet potatoes and grilled tofu. It had great components but the flavor of the house dressing was just flat to me and the salad became so boring after a few bites. I think a tomato vinaigrette dressing or a green goddess dressing with some kick to it would have been better or something with chili or some spice at all. The curry sauce given to me when I asked for hot sauce didn't go well with the salad. It took me great effort to get the rest of the salad down and my husband helped me eat it as he knew and could sense my suffering through the salad. I had wished I had gotten the buffalo cauliflower instead with the dipping since and side of celery my neighbors had next to me, they said it was the only reason they come here at all. Lovely to know that fact after ordering. Oh well. You win some, you lose some. This place fell short for me.
