Simply amazing! Had the pleasure of enjoying a couple's massage with my boyfriend and we came out super relaxed and blissful. My massage therapist was named Alyssa, she is gentle and sweet, I highly recommend her. They have a fitness center, lap pool, hot tubs and saunas available so you can literally spend the day there pampering yourself.
