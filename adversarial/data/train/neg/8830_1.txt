Calling to make the initial intake can be painful and frustrating because there is no consistent method, varies person by person. I have gotten told to do things incorrectly more than a few times and left to argue with intake after going back and forth between therapist instructions and intake. I feel like waiting room could be kept cleaner. However all my children see Erica and she is amazing  she has been super helpful in getting us referred out for services I didn't even realized we needed or could have. I enjoy that she is open to communication by email throughout the week to stay on same page. It's helpful they have different people available for some different therapies at the same location as well. My husband and I are now also about to get therapy there involving my sons disability which also turns into marriage counseling and family counseling involving my sons father. I love having everything in one place for everyone and the fact that everyone openly communicates to make sure we are all taken care of.
