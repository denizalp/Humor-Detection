went there a few times. First, we ordered the lobster lunch set for $29.99. It comes with lobster E-noodle, a plate of veggie and a pot of congee. They will put the live lobster in the congee in front of you. I think this is good value. On top of this set, we also ordered one set lunch - hoi nam chicken rice ($8.99). This comes with a drink. I personally think this one is soso and will not order again. Second time I came with friends and we ordered the noodle lunch special where you can pick 3 types of toppings for $8.99. This is not bad. Service is great and I don't mind to go back again.
