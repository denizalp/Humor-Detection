My husband and I recently moved to Gilbert, and tried this place on a whim because we drive past it constantly. The service was amazing, each time we've been every employee from the hostess to the servers were very friendly and welcoming. The owner actually remembered our names from the first to second visit, even though we only had a brief conversation during the first visit. Their fettuccine Alfredo is my new favorite, and the garlic knots are great too! We highly recommend this place.
