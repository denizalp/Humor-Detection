Great coffee shop! They have a huge selection of coffees and teas and I love their sticker system (dont worry, you dont have to figure anything out, they do it all). \n\nDrinks (5\/5)- I got the Iced Lao Latte which is amazing! And my friends had the regular coffee as well and loved it!\n\nService (5\/5)- They were so friendly and speedy, we were in and out in no time, without the feeling that they're rushing us out.\n\nVibe (4.5\/5)- I think it's really cute, love the design. No space to sit inside, but the area around has lots of seating so you're fine.\n\nOverall (5\/5)- I live nearby so I'll be here regularly to try their different lattes and teas.
