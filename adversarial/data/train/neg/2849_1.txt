It's all about money they don't care about your health at all. They send you back and forth so they can keep you coming back without solving your problem. Their medical knowledge is zero! Specially doctor Rafay who is the owner of the place got her diploma only 5 years ago. She doesn't know anything I'm  pretty sure she forgot everything she learned already because she is not practicing anything. I am a nursing student so as I m learning new stuff and how to approach a patient , I realize how careless Doctor Rafay is. For example physical assesment that she claims to do for every patient once a year has nothing to do with medical physical health assessment , she skips every single detail and it takes only 5 min which should take around 30-40 min for a person. Any many other wrong diagnosis or wrong treatment. We needed a suture for a knee wound and they messed it up it has been a year and still my husband can not sit on his knee and when you ask them everything is NOrmal no follow up or anything. And plus they have the rudest staff ever\nDon't recommend it AT ALL!
