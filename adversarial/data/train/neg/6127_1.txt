3 stars because of how much I loved them in the past. 2 starts because of last night. My last  2 visits, service has been poor. Last night was a disappointment. Service was slow and neglectful. Hard to get refills, or napkins when a spill occurred. A salad ordered without croutons came with them on. Salmon ordered with the butter sauce on the side came like that but also still cooked and drenched in butter. We finally got a hold of a manger who remade the salmon and came back with salmon that was not cooked thoroughly, did not ask for a 3 try. Also, I ordered the steak fries, there is no mention that they come with seasoning. I told the manager that I could not eat them (due to allergies) when she removed the salmon. She never offered to replace them with another side. The salmon came back alone. And yes, we were charged in full.
