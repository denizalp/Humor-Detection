In all, this resturant is normal but some kind of expensive. Service was a little slow and the dishes are not enough to eat. My boyfriend and I ordered a SEAFOOD TOWER (which is indicated for 2-4 persons in the menu, $58), a BEEF CARPACCIO (Mushroom, Parmesan cheese and bone marrow, $16) and a FRESH MOZZARELLA COMPOSITION (Heirloom tomatoes, shaved golden beets, grilled eggplant and basil emulsion, $11), and we paid $108 plus tax and tips in the end. However, both of us were not full--even though my boyfriend refused to admit the fact, I know he just lied to me in order to comfort my worries. If you just want to find a place to chat with friends rather than to be filled up, it is still recommended considering the good environment.
