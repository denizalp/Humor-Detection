I'd never had any services\/\"procedures\" done on my face, so was pretty nervous and wanted to make sure I saw someone I trusted. \n\nAfter an initial consult, Megan thought micro needling would be effective against hyper pigmentation I'd developed from acne. When she told me the price I couldn't believe how inexpensive it was - pleasant surprise! And she never pressured me to buy extra sessions or products.\n\nWhen it came to the actual procedure she was wonderful! Checking in regularly to make sure it wasn't hurting (it totally didn't!) and talking me through what she was doing.\n\nAnd most importantly, results: it's only been 48hrs since my first session but I can already see way more improvement than I expected. I'm so happy I went to Megan.
