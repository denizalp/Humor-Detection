ALWAYS GET A SECOND OPINION\n\n* Had an A\/C problem\n* Had Mojave come inspect, they beat another company on price\n* Six months later, having same problem\n* Mojave comes and finds \"new problem\", offers 2 expensive solutions\n* Second opinion comes out and quickly finds large problem, which was very likely the original problem.\n* Says the previous work Mojave did was almost certainly unnecessary (believable, because we were having the same problems as before.) \n* Also finds Mojave made multiple mistakes on the previous work done\n* Mojave upset we let another company fix the major problem\n* Mojave begrudgingly fixes the few mistakes other company pointed out\n* No apology, nor refund for the poor quality of work\n\nNames omitted, this is not an attack on individuals, rather a warning to consumers! It is not about money, it is about quality and value of services and being valued as a customer.  I hope you can find an A\/C company that is honest and stands by the quality of their work.  I DO NOT believe Mojave is such a company.\n\nTo address the multiple positive reviews, I initially believed they were doing great work and treating me fairly, and then I got a second opinion...\n\nIf you would like full details (including photograph\/video evidence), so you can make an educated decision when choosing an A\/C repair company, feel free to message me. I would be glad to share the full details.
