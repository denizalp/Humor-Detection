Went to this place during its soft opening. I called in for a 6:30 appointment for my friend and I, full set and pedicure. When we got there, they said they overbooked and asked us to wait. After waiting for an hour and about to leave, they took us back to settle in for a pedicure. My friend was seen right away but I waited another half hour for service. \n\nFast forward to getting our full sets...\nMy nail technician decided to not use tips and instead use the acrylic powder and stickers to create my nails. This would have been fine if it did not take 3 hours to complete. She didn't file down my nails and left them thick and bulky. The shape I requested (almond) was far from what was created. By the time she was finished it was 11:30 pm and I just needed to leave. \n\nMy nails looked so terrible I had to get them redone. At the end of the week, I went to a local nail salon in my state. My new nail technician saw my nails and felt so bad for me, she gave me a new full set, free of charge, only charging for for the removal of my original set done by Nab Nails. \n\nIf you're looking for a showy place, this is the spot for you. Otherwise, I do not recommend.
