Prices still high even going out of business. As I was going in everyone was not holding any bags as they were walking out. Had a 20% coupon that they emailed me off sale and clearance prices would not honor, expires April 23rd. Hellooooo that's why your going out of business your prices to high you need a coupon just to shop there.. See ya Sport Chalet...
