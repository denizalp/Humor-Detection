This AVEDA Lifestyle spa is a great place to get pampered up! The staff was very helpful with everything we requested. I went with a few of my girlfiends to try out their Signature Day of Beauty salon and spa package, and they were able to schedule all of us for different procedures at certain times so that we could all have lunch together! It was catered by Panera, I believe. The package originally included a 1 hour Aroma Swedish massage, customized 1 hour Aveda facial, shampoo with soothing scalp, neck and shoulder massage, and blow-dry style. This is followed with an Aroma Spa manicure and pedicure, in addition to a full make up application by their beauticians. The lunch was free, and a free gift (Aveda body wash) was given to take home. I personally did not take everything on the package, like the manicure and full make up application, but they were able to substitute it with a haircut instead. I was able to pay about the same price ($265 for 5 hours, not including tax and tip).\n\nA great place to just relax and be a girl. However, I would probably only go back for the facial and maybe the massage (although, the masseuse was very rough!)
