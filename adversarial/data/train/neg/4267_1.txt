I've been here 3 times in the past week and if it wasn't for the food, I wouldn't be returning. In all seriousness, it is evident that they are understaffed, which is reflected in the service and long wait time of food. This is disappointing because their food is really, really good, but if things don't improve soon I'm moving on to somewhere new.
