Staff is awesome -- so helpful to newbies.  Food is yummy... but just a warning, it is very rich and greasy too.  Lots of sauce and other gooey stuff on everything, which is what makes it so tasty, but it's not for everyone.  Think traditional food truck style food.  The place has some outside seating, and they are dog friendly! Items are made to order so you can ask for certain ingredients or items on the side.  We had the carne asada fries, the angry dog and the bahn mi dog.
