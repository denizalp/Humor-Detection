We have now been here three times and the place is a hidden gem, tucked away in the corner of a strip mall. Everything is fresh, cooked well and tasty. The egg rolls are some of the best that I have had in the valley. The menu has lots of options and so far, everything has been delicious. The prices are affordable and they will go out of their way to make your visit pleasant. We showed up once with ten people, and they managed to fit us in. The down side: the place is small-ish which isn't necessarily a problem, but there is a VERY small waiting area. You are basically waiting just on the inside of the door and you can find yourself elbow to elbow with strangers very quickly. That, combined with the...early dining crowd, means that it is best to get here after 7. I don't know if they have a special price before 5:30, but the place is packed from 5-6:30 or so. This could be due to snow bird season...will find out next month.
