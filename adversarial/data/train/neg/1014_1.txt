Ordered the special medium any way, buy 2 for $6.99 each.  Sounded like a good deal.\nNot so much - undercooked, very little cheese.  When I placed the order via phone they acted like they had no idea of the coupon I was trying to use.\n\nTook the survey on the back to get $10 off a $20 order, thought I would give them a second chance.  NOPE  Code not valid at either Pizza Hut at this location or near work.  \n\nWon't be going back there again.
