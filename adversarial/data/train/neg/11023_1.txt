This place kills it with tacos. I could have them all the time. Guac and chips were amazing - the chips were freshly deep fried and so crispy. I think they were even dumpling wrappers. Had the carnitaz de maciza and baja fish tacos and they were mouthwatering. I want to try the bulgogi shrimp el diablo. Must go back!!!
