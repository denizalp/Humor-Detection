Recommendation: Great tasting wraps complimented by feel-good soups. Great place for a hot breakfast or lunch during cold days! Definitely coming back soon. MUST TRY.\n\nI ordered: Lamb curry wrap + corn chowder combo. HOWEVER, they got my soup wrong and gave me Porcini Mushroom Wild Rice Bisque soupe instead. \n\n+1 Price vs portion: Looks small but you won't be hungry after eating everything. \n\n+1 Taste: The Lamb curry wrap was so flavorful that I want to try all the other wraps. Even though the soup was wrong but I kept it anyway. Turns out, the mushroom soup was on the blander side which perfectly complimented the intense and spicy wrap. \n\n-1 Customer service: Even though it was a good accident, I would be happier eating what I ordered. \n\n+ 1  Comfortable place to eat: A bit clumped up but it's downtown so can't really complain. They have a huge table in the middle so that's good for a small group. \n\n-1 no \"Wow!\" factor, felt like a fast food place.
