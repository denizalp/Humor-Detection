Our last two visits to a Famous Toastery, including today's visit to this location, have yielded similar treatment.  After our order was delivered, we were ignored. No drink refills offered, no \"do you need anything?\", no \"is everything okay?\"  The \"every server is your server\" policy seems to have resulted in \"no server is your server.\"  The food, as usual, is very good but I do not want to have to chase down a server for an extra napkin or more coffee.  I want to be asked.  This looks kind of whiny but I suspect I am not the only one who expects attention from my server.
