Came here to try out Guy Fieri's restaurant in Vegas! Since my first visit, I've been back a couple of times. It's definitely a delicious place to get a burger or a sandwich.\n\nI remember getting the '68 Cajun Sandwich with the waffle fries. Wow, that was perfect. The way the cajun sauces just flavored everything. I also love the presentation, with everything on a wooden cutting board. The waffle fries were delicious. One of my friends told me I need to try their garlic fries next time. Definitely will. \n\nI was also really impressed with how attentive the service I've gotten here. Our waiter checked in with us pretty frequently -- probably about every 15-20 minutes.\n\nOverall, I can say I like this place and I'll be back, but there isn't anything I've tried here that I *crave.* (Except maybe the fries.) So I think ultimately it depends on how long the wait is. We didn't have a wait, so our experience started off great -- but I've heard people who have waited over an hour to get a table. I'm not so sure I'd be happy with the experience if I had to wait that long. \n\nThey do have both indoor and outdoor seating though. So if you like people watching, you could always grab an outdoor seat.\n\nP.S. This location is part of The Linq building, which is part of Total Rewards. So if there's a massive line and you want to skip the line, just go find yourself a new friend with Diamond status or higher with Total Rewards. It'll let your group skip the entire queue.
