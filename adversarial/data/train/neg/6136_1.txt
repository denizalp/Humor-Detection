Dr. Shelly O'Connor is a GREAT chiropractor!  She really cares about your whole being and educating you on how the whole body SYSTEM works so that you can live a happy healthy life.  When you listen to her talk it all makes sense and makes you WANT to be a better person when you understand how simple it is to live optimally.  She explains how chiropractic care is NOT just about \"cracking your back\" so that the pain in your neck or leg goes away, but teaches you how to sit better, eat better, function better so that pain stays away.  The other thing I REALLY liked about visiting her is that she makes is extremely affordable to see her on a regular basis ($25 per visit or $200 for a 10 visit \"pass\"); which is utterly unheard of in most practices.  Her personality is another awesome feature of her service!  She puts you immediately at ease if you are at all hesitant about seeing a chiropractor for the first time, which I was.  There's no down-side to seeing Dr. Shelly!
