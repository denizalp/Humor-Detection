We had a bad experience at Gimme Some Sugar tonight. The server seemed like she was intentionally not helping us. There was a big party in front of us taking a long time to place an order. We waited patiently. After they ordered  the server left for 3 - 5 minutes to get them drinks. We still kept patient and polite. The party decided to move tables. So the server helped them move. Now there was someone in line behind us. It was starting to seem intentional the wy she kept getting distracted. We were not being rude in any way. She then stopped to take a picture of the group. After that she wandered up to the counter, kind of smirking at us. We finally placed our order. We almost left before that. Luckily Gimme Sugar has good macaroons. We have been to the shop many times and have also been treated polietly with respect. This was a bad experience after a great night.
