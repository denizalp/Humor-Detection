Just left Chris helped me and my fianc√©. I am so not good with firearms and he was so patient and helped me so much! By the end I felt a lot more comfortable. Not only did he help with shooting he was just so pleasant to be around. I will come back because that's how awesome the whole experience was! Thanks so much Chris !
