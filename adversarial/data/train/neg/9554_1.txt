Not a lot of options on the menu so this place is not for the picky. It is inside my favorite hotel on the strip, The Cosmopolitan. Be prepared to wait an hour and I would love to say its worth the wait but that's just too long to stand in line for food. If you get there early in the morning maybe you can beat the rush. I got the slut and its on the small side for portion size. So for the price you do not get a lot of food here. After waiting so long I was pretty hungry so it did not meet my needs.
