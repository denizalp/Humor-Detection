Dr. Fedoriw is the BEST back pain doctor I have ever seen. I have been seeing him for a few years and I am extremely impressed with his knowledge and his understanding of my pain. I get injections 6 times a year and I'm always confident that he will do them right! Also, his staff is awesome! They make you feel like family. I have been to several other back pain institutes, which were ok, but this one beats them all. Thank you so much for everything!
