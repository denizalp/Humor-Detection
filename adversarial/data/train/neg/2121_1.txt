By far the worst Nekter in the valley. So dirty! The back where they make the food, has food everywhere and containers with dirty residue all over it. The people who work there are so unpleasant and are not welcoming. I asked for coconut flakes to be added on top of my bowl... they charged me for them but no coconut flakes to be found. My fianc√© got his usual bowl but said it tasted not how it usually tastes. The fruit wasn't fresh. Honestly so disappointed since it's the closet Nekter to the house. Do yourself a favor and go to the other locations. Do not waste your time and money here. We will go back to the Scottsdale or Arcadia locations.
