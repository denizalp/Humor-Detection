I ordered a combo off of Grubhub from here and the delivery guy forgot my drink. He didn't take responsibility for his mistake and told me to go ahead and call the restaurant, so I did. I spoke with a manager -I didn't catch his name, but he was super nice and offered to bring my drink to me himself! I don't work far from this location, but I definitely appreciated the excellent customer service. 5 stars for the manager and his hospitality.
