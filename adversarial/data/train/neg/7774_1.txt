Absolutely a phenomenal contemporary French cuisine restaurant right in the heart of Mile End! I went here with a friend and had some truly outstanding cuisine. Highlights (current) are the watermelon soup, the veal tartare, and the Arctic char dish.  Fantastic service, flavorful and inventive French cuisine, and a great wine selection. Really can't ask for much more!
