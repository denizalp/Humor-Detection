The service buoyed my rating to a three as everyone was very friendly and helpful. Food though was just so so. The breading is the same for all the chicken with lots of paprika, chili, and others spices EXCEPT salt. The breading itself is not super crispy which in by book is a minus. The slaw was a bit dry. I did think the fries were good though. They are a shoestring cut. \n\nThe price totaled over $32 for lunch which was fairly pricey however the potions were huge and we could have gotten by with sharing one meal which would have made it reasonable. \n\nI agree with others, Raising Canes is much better.
