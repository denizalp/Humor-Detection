My wife and I, we have rented a townhouse with Cindy from Biltmore Properties in Scottsdale while we were in transition from selling our home and taking ownership of a new home and going through major remodel at the same time.... Her communication and attention to details are top notch.  Always available to our questions... quick response to emails... and anytime we had a request for maintenance to resolve her team was right there to assist.  If I am ever in need of property manager Cindy with Biltmore properties is definitely my choice 100% ... and I am writing this from the tenant point of view... THANK YOU, CINDY !!!
