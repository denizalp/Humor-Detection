One friend had the gnochi in rose sauce. Perfectly cooked, the gnocchi was soft to the bite that resisted once you got toward the middle, like biting the fat little toes of your favourite toddler. This dish is simple and delicious; pillowy soft nuggets bathed in a rich tomato sauce of cream, butter and parmesan, the generous portion dares you to finish it in one go.
