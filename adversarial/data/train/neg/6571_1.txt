Excellent little ethnic Indian supermarket tucked away in a strip mall. They have all kinds of rice, spices and snacks you won't easily find anywhere else! There is also a hot foods section. Prices are reasonable, and the area is clean. Of course, there is a strong smell of Indian type spices, but what do you think they sell here?!!?
