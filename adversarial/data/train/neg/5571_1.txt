PET OWNERS BEWARE!\n\nThis place, while open 24 hours, will not hesitate to take your money and ask for a ridiculous amount for an overnight hospitalization. A simple assessment and x-rays after my cat fell from a high balcony ended up costing close to $1300, and could have cost another $5000 just for overnight observation. They neglected to mention that the bandage they put on my cat's leg should have been removed within 40 minutes of returning home; 4 days later, I returned to ask why her paw was swollen and inflamed, and THAT's when they thought to tell me to remove the damn bandage. As a result, the cat is now limping and unable to put any weight on her leg.\n\nSHAME ON YOU Veterinary Emergency Clinic for robbing pet owners blind while offering sub par care.
