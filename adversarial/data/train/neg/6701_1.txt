Too bad its so close to home and so terrible. Read the comments about food poisoning, bad service, limited selection of meats, dishonesty towards Groupon deals, etc. NOT like other Brazilian places. This churrascaria is destined to close someday. They either change their ways or they will be forced to close its doors with a lawsuit. Sad.
