I brought my family here after I heard great things about this place....the reviews were dead wrong. The waitress took forever to take our order. We got to the restaurant at 7pm...we didn't get any water until 7:45pm. After requesting for water on three separate occasions, we still did not get them. We had to ask another waiter to get us some water. Our assigned waitress also forgot to put in our order at first and then managed to put in the wrong order. I usually don't leave negative reviews, but this place takes the cake for horrible service. Although, the service was lacking the food was decent. Maybe?
