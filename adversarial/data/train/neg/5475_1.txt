I work near them and was looking for a new healthy lunch option.  The reviews inspired us to give the Green Regime a try.  Located inside the Partell Pharmacy, the place was very clean and modern.  The service was very nice and the food was exceptional.  Our juice orders were great and the wraps and sandwiches were excellent. My buddy said the egg salad sandwich was the best he had ever had.  For three people the cost was $38 with blends.
