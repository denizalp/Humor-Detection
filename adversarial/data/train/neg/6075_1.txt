I was seated and soaking in water at 11am. It is now 1:40 and I just left. I came prepared with a design photo and was told when I arrived that it was no problem, so I chose my colors to match the design. Design time came and it was a different tech. It seemed like she had a bit of an attitude. She attempted the design but then said she cant use regular polish colors for nail art. Ok, I wish that was said in the beginning. So then I said can I just have a simple flower, whatever she feels comfortable doing. She then says my toe nail is to round and small for that. I have had a lot of pedicures with designs and have never been told this. At this point I was unhappy and wanted to leave since I had been there so long and decided to just have plain polish no design just so I could get out of there.
