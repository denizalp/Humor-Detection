The waitresses have a very unhappy attitude. The gluten-free option recommended was steamed veggies, so we ordered it with garlic. It came without garlic and with no flavor whatsoever. The rest of the food ordered seemed very sloppy and certainly not worth the price. One of us left their unfinished food behind. Despite all this, the waitress noticed we didn't tip and demanded that we did so, which we thought was rude.
