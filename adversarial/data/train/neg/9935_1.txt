The staff here scheduled my son for his cleaning incorrectly by scheduling him a 3rd visit in a 12mo period. As a parent I showed up when instructed to by the staff. I had to pay $100 for the third visit. I contacted my insurance and was told told it was the clinic when I finally followed up with the clinic they told me I should have known. They need to better train their staff and take responsibility when they know theyve made an error and atleast offer to help partially correct it if at all.
