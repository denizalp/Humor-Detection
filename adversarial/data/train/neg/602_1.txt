5-5-5-5. All around great bar. Incredible beer selection and so much fun to try. The beers are always rotating at all times so what you have today won't be the same as what you have next time. You can take beer with you, and craft beer, at that....so, mega plus. Now besides that AWESOME factor, there's the food. The food is amazing. So delicious! My boyfriends burger was larger than my head and we literally just stared at it for a minute before we both decided maybe a fork and knife would be best to start with. It was crazy delicious besides the mess and he says totally worth it. I had a nice, neat sandwich that was definitely delicious and I would probably order it again, and will definitely be back soon! Wooohoooooo!
