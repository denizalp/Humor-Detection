Prolly the best Thai food I've had in Vegas so far. Only been here for a year so I'm sure I'll come across other ones. \nGot seated right away but then again it was like 9pm \nDecor needs a little update. Seats were all torn out \nSpace is a little small. Which is a good thing coz you know it's a whole in a wall type thing. \n\nDidn't get a chance to take pics coz we were so hungry \nHad the chicken wings appetizer (took long to come) prolly won't order it again coz there was nothing that says Thai about those wings. \n\nI got the chicken red curry and let me tell you they were so good! They got the right amount of spiciness and thickness it's not watered down and it was a lot. \n\nMy bf got the drunken noodles and he loved it, it's not dry like others we've tried b4.\n\nWill def come back here and very happy we found a really good Thai plan around our neighborhood. Too bad they don't deliver to our area. \n\nThis would have easily gotten 5 stars but can't get pass the leather seats they are peaking off and tissue on the floor holding the table to be even.
