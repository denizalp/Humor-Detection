My husband liked (but did not love) Morcilla.  I found their kitchen a bit too devoted to using vegetables as a garnish on a half cup of butter.  Yeah, the main dish was the melted butter, and the veggies were the garnish.   They cheaped out on the mariscos by filling it out with chick peas.  At least they didn't call it paella.  (It was also on the upper end of too salty.)  The butter and oil totally overwhelmed the more subtle taste of the vegetables and seafood.  I do not object to fat per se, but Morcilla's kitchen was just using it as a crutch for sparse or common ingredients.  The ambience was nice, but really, anybody can melt a stick of butter on a vegetable and heap cheese and aioli on top.   How about some finesse instead of hammering us with GREASE?
