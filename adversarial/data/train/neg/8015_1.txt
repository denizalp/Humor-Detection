Upscale Bar food, pizzas, salad, burgers.  I thought it was very good.  It is pricey for bar food, but I thought the food was great.  I had a delicious salad and my husband had a burger.  I love the open concept restaurants and if you're interested in a lighter meal before going out, I think this is a great choice.
