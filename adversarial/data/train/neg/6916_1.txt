A strange store.  Lots of used (returns?) items along side older new merchandise.  Find the right item and you get a bargain but it's hit or miss.  A great place to stop by when in the mood to just buy something more substantial than what the dollar stores carry.  But don't show up with a list expecting to find everything.
