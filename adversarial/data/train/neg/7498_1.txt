I've already had one bad experience with Hash House. The location in San Diego. In LAS to watch a concert with my girl. Stayed at the Rio. Went to HH there in the hotel when I decided to give them another go.\n\nI shouldn't have.\n\nFood was disgustingly cold. I had the meatloaf hash. Correct me if I'm wrong but shouldn't certain dishes be hot when you get them? Service? Our waitress seemed like she'd seen one tourist too many. Couldn't be bothered to check on us. The rest of the wait staff we noticed didn't smile...at all. When we asked another employee for extra napkins he just got them without a word and didn't acknowledge our thank you.\n\nOnly bright spot was the cashier. She was bubbly and nice to chat with. Other than that. Don't bother with HH. ANY location.
