I've been with State Farm Insurance company for years and this is THE WORST place to go. After moving here we found this place thinking it was so close to home only to find out location is not always everything. From day 1 we've had problems with our car insurance. Each month we were the ones trying to figure out why our monthly premium was always changing and doing higher and higher only to be given the run around. Like any agent who's trying trying to get business, they start out pleasant and friendly hoping to get your money and even go as far as providing you with their business card and says \"call me\" if you have questions. Well, that friendly service goes out the window once you become there customer. When you try to call your agent\/owner of that office, she never calls back, and when you call the office, she's always too busy and will call you when SHE has time. Sorry to say I'd rather pay a little more for better service somewhere else. I will never go back to this office.
