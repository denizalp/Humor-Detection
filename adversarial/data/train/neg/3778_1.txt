Stayed in room 215 which was clean with new carpet. Has a nice pool, ac works, smelled clean, new carpets and tv. Sheets were clean but the bedspreads had a stain or two, and a cigarette burn. No smells however. Location felt safe, lots of food choices.  It's fine for a short stay visit. Weather was great in March. Had 0 complaints about service.
