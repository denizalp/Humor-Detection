lived in Vegas for 7 years and this was the first time I visited the Peppermill. The food was great. The place is crowded and way too noisy but it was fun. Huge portions although the service was slow because it was crowded. Our server was excellent and kept us filled with coffee and soda. Overall a delightful experience.
