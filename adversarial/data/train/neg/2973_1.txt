Hadn't been to Kelseys in a long time as I evade most chain restaurants, but I must give them credit when due. Food was delicious, yet service lacking...had to ask for a refill and he was scarce until he handed us our bill. Forgivable however as the lunch rush had begun. It's a busy restaurant with lots of meal options and affordable lunch specials.
