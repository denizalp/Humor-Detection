Unbelievable. Spent $80 one beer,  one glass of wine and two entrees that had 1\/2 cup of food per serving. We were wondering if we should ask our waiter for a second helping. I will will say that it was very good, but we left to go eat dinner somewhere else. No appetizers no extras.  This was a very disappointing event because we had heard so many good things.
