RCI 5 Star Gold Crown isn't what it use to be...\nThe place was nice, but not spectacular compared to other timeshares I've been at.  Its at the SouthPoint, away from the main strip.\n\nSheets in the closet stunk like the prior people that use them, and hasn't been washed.  \nRoom is quiet, well accompanied and with great facilities for a timeshare.\nJacuzzi en suite is ok (broken actually with 2 inoperaable jets)... \nNot strong like other timeshares (see Napa Shell Vacations)\n\nPool is shallow,  good for 2-6 year olds.\nNot enough to do laps as the depth is only 3 foot deep.\n\nBroken coffee maker, 2 remote controls, just adds to the number of calls I had to make to get these issues fixed (which took hours).\n\nAnd they want to sell you on this timeshare... Solicitation calls made 2 times during stay.  Very unpleasant after 1st no.
