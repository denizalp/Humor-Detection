Very disappointed by the meat department today (4\/3 around 6pm).  All of the steaks were huge so I asked the butcher boy to cut a smaller piece of a steak.  He did reluctantly as if I was asking something extraordinary.\nAnyway I just needed one half (still 0.69 pounds for just one half!). The butcher said this is not something that they normally do, but that they \"will let it slide this time\".  And no, he was not joking!  What a way to deal with customers!  I told him this is not normal to sell pieces this big.  I hope the store manager will read this.  Forcing customers to buy more than they need, well... will force them to shop somewhere else...\nI am not obese and don't plan on becoming by eating 1.5 lbs steaks!
