Great atmosphere and layout! Great happy hour pricing! The patio is very nice and includes a fire place and fire table. The food selection is more diverse than most sports bars, but lacking in options. I'd like to see more things on happy hour or the menu in general. I'd have given it five stars but the service was realllllly slow. The poor girl was training a new employee and seemed to be covering 80% of the place! It wasn't her fault at all but we had to wait forever for more drinks, etc. but, this may be home they keep HH drafts down to $2.50! Pro tip: Order two at a time or rapid fire. Cool vibe... can't wait to do a guy night here with the boys and play some of video games, etc.
