I'm writing this review based on my dining experience here. The service was great and our waitress was very attentive. The menu was straightforward and the food came out in a timely manner. Overall, the food was just average though. Portion size was a bit too small for the price. I got the Parmesan crusted chicken wrap with a side of Parmesan fries. The wrap was smaller than my hand, and I have small hands. The wrap was just a typical chicken wrap smothered in mayo. The fries claimed to be tossed in some garlic parm mix, but tasted like it was tossed in plain salt to me. The fries were crispy though, which I like. My meal came out to be over $10 and it was just meh. \n\nConsidering the fact that I was in Southside and there are plenty of better dinning options around for the same price, I probably will not go out of my way to get food here. There's Fatheads and the Library a few blocks down.
