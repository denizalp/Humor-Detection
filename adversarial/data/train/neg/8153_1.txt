I had the best experience at Warner Family Practice!  I was able to get a same-day appointment and I was in and out in under an hour.  I saw Laurie Silicato, PA-C.  She was extremely thorough and made sure all of my questions were answered.  The front office staff was welcoming and efficient.  I didn't have to wait long in the waiting room either.  I arrived a few minutes early for my appointment and my name was called right away.  Laurie ordered a chest x-ray for me and the x-ray tech was fabulous as well.  I didn't have to wait long for the x-ray either. Everyone at the practice was professional, efficient and helpful.  I would definitely recommend Laurie and Warner Family Practice.
