This is your typical viet restaurant, prices are pretty for the portion size. It was a little bit weird that they had other foods like spaghetti on the menu.  Well anywayz i came here for the vietnamese food. And it was good! Pretty good space, lots of room for customers and pretty good staff friendly and inviting. If your looking for decent place to eat, and your craving for some pho this is good enough. Just dont expect them to WOW you!
