I literally can never get enough of sushi and this place is great! Ambiance is unique with the Spanish and Brazilian influence and the food is definitely different. \n\nI got the sea bass dish which was amazing!! The only thing I didn't quite like about it were the veggies that were paired with it (the carrots were so hard and didn't quite go well) but the fish itself was cooked and seasoned to perfection!\n\nWe also shared some other stuff like edamame, the tacos (which were quite small and they make you order minimum 2 per order), and some rolls.
