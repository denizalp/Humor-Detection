I don't understand what the fuss or \"cool factor\" about this place. The food is pretty mediocre (lots of burgers and sandwiches and salads kind of place). Not any kind of impressive drink selection because the typical options you would see at a sit-down restaurant in Madison. It's located in an area that's difficult to get to (little parking and in the middle of a weird traffic triangle). Once inside, it's pretty much a \"meh\" feeling looking around.
