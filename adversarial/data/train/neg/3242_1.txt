Can only give three stars: on a positive note, they were no nonsense quick and easy to deal with on the sales end. On a negative note; they say they support Luke Air Force Base and military personnel, but they can't get anybody veteran plates for their vehicles. But you pay documentation fees to them, to deal with paper work related stuff with DMV. When I bought a car last year, that dealer had no problem getting my veteran plates. Now I can go spend two hours at the DMV. Then I come to find out couple days later that they didn't even fix the third brake light on the vehicle, which is a safety issue and couple of things that is safety related. There was another issue with the vehicle that they told me that the vehicle was designed that way. When I was talking to a guy at Starbucks he showed me how to fix the issues(I understand it's a Toyota dealership, when a guy at Starbucks show me how to fix it, it says a lot about your mechanics). And also particular used vehicle I bought, particular dealership sits right next-door to them. I stop in at that dealership and asked them about the issue and they told me that it was not designed that way and no vehicle is designed that way after 60s no matter the make. I just hate being lied to, says a lot about people's character. Just protect yourself on buying a car because dealerships will lie to you to get your business or I should say your money.
