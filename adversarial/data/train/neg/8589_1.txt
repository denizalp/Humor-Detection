I'm not that pleased with this experience. For the price, I expected better ambiance and better presentation. The steaks were seasoned and cooked well. Our family enjoys a good cut that's perfectly done to each person's speculations. Also the service was perfect. Our server was thoughtful and attentive, without overly interrupting when we didn't need anything. However, for the high price of everything (not just the steaks) on the menu, we would've expected the place to feel more exclusive, more fancy, not so loud. It felt like a nice bar rather than a fine dining establishment. We had to shout over the noise and the place wasn't even totally full (Sunday evening). The plates were also nothing special to look at. Again because of the price, we expected a few frills. The meat and separate sides came out just plainly put onto plates. No effort was put into the presentation. Even casual restaurants throw some greens or garnishes on the dish for a little extra aesthetic. Probably won't return. If I'm paying this much, I'd like to feel a little more pampered.
