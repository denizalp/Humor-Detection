I had two raw oysters, which were quite good, followed by brussel sprouts, which were oversalted and nothing special, followed by scallops, which had an unpleasant, unrecognizeable sauce, lacked depth of flavor and was by no means a filling or fulfilling meal.  I will not return and was disappointed because Chef Moonen has such a good reputation.
