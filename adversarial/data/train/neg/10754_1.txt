Very disappointing experience. \n\nWhen I arrived with my group at Hot Taco, there was no line and several empty tables. A woman who I assumed was the manager (seeing as she was dressed nicely and not in a uniform) came to the host stand asking if she could help us. She told us she would go find the host. She didn't. Several employees passed us at this time - one said hello and that someone would be there shortly, but the rest kept walking by us. When we finally sat down, our drinks (margaritas and water) took 40 +minutes to arrive. The waitress kept continuously complaining to us that the bartender was being slow and complaining about him, which made us feel extremely uncomfortable. In her defense, she did bring us two rounds of chips and salsa before another waitress helped us out and brought us water. The margaritas ended up being very watered down, and I traded it in for a Chardonnay. Several members of the wait staff stopped by our table to apologize for the delay and kept telling us how busy they were, which was a nice gesture but there were several open tables, open spots at the bar and no wait - nothing that seemed outrageous for a Friday night in Charlotte.  It seemed like several other tables had similar issues, as we saw two different parties walk up to the bar to get their own drinks. The taco I ordered was okay and seemed a little cold, but the rice and beans were a good side. \n\nI give 2 stars because I wasn't charged for the margarita.
