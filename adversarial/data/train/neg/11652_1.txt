Enjoy eating here, it's really good. Would not go as far as to say great and it's a little on the pricey side. My favorite thing after the ribs is the Cherrywine Soda, I only drink pop once or twice a year, but this stuff is addictive! BBQ is incredibly subjective and I fully understand what I love others might not and vice versa. Not a big fan of vinegary sauces, but again I could be the minority. Sides are ok, but come for the meat! Great dining experience, nice place, won't probably get out too cheap, but would definitely go back!
