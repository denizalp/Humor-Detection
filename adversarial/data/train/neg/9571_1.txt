I work near here, so the location is convenient.  For me location paramount! If it's hard to get to, I probably won't be making it there that often. That being said, once I get past the idea of being drenched in my own sweat, and I mean drenched (try not to be grossed out), I really like this place!\n\nThings going for this place: Clean, spacious, friendly staff, they provide shampoo\/soap in the showers, varied class times and varied instructors.\n\nI really recommend trying out a few different nights and finding the instructors you like best. For me it's Alex and Julia. They are actually both quite different with different styles (Julia being very positive and relaxed and Alex a bit more strict) but I really feel like I get a lot out of their classes. \n\nThe one thing I hate about ALL yoga places is the price, and this place is of course no different.\n\nBeen going for almost two months and I can still just barely touch my toes (no fault of the instructors!!) but I feel I am making progress and I think I am a yoga convert!!
