I love Ferris! The trainers are amazing and energetic. Unlike many gyms I've been to, they are there to train YOU and correct YOUR form.\nI have never left a class not feeling challenged and I have never woken up after a class not sore (in the best way).\nThe only reason I have elected not to join as a permanent member is that I joined a gym that has more class variety (spinning, yoga, pilates, etc...)
