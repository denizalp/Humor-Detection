Yikes! We won't be staying here again the next time we are in the Charlotte area. \n\nThe man at the front desk was nice enough, but the entire experience didn't match up. The first night we were there, all the lights were off outside the hotel. People bumped around in their cars blasting music for a good part of the night. It is always a bad feling when you are afraid to fall asleep at a hotel because you hear crazy people outside.  :\/ \n\nThe next morning, we opened the cutains to find a group of sketchy-looking people hanging around a couple hundred feet away at a 'i-95 coach waiting area' (no idea what this was about). But, they definitely made us feel uncomfortable as they stared us down as we walked to our car. We debated on trying to get out of staying the second night, but decided it wasn't worth the trouble (the office had a sign posted saying there were no refunds after 10 mins of check in). We decided to rough it the second night. Upon leaving the hotel for the day, we finally saw in daylight that this definitely was not the posh side of Charlotte and there were some pretty scary folks running the streets. \n\nAnyway, so we returned to the hotel later that night and found our A\/C cranked to 60 degrees. When getting into the shower to warm up, we found that the shampoo packets had been replaced by bar soap. (We'd forgotten shampoo, and had planned on using hotel shampoo!). OOPS! \n\nBwah! So overall, not good. I'll give them an extra star for the front office guy, since he was TRYING, and just seemed like a nice man trying to make a living. For the whole experience though... bad, bad, bad!
