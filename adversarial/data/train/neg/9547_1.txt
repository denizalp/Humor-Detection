Monty's is one of my fave brunch-or-lunch places, especially on lazy weekends when I want breakfast food at 2pm but do not want big-chain food.  They have a wide array of something for everyone from vegan offerings to biscuits and gravy to slices of cake taller than your head, and it's all tasty.  \n\nIt does get really crowded at peak times, and the service can be hit-or-miss to an extreme:  sometimes I've gotten a server who hangs around making hilarious jokes and sometimes I've been in parties that were actually forgotten about after we were seated and then have the orders wrong when we finally did get our food (although the bad service is definitely more rare than the good).  \n\nAll-in-all the tasty food and the kitschy atmosphere make it worth the wait.
