I lived 40 years in Albuquerque and the pozole with green here rates with the best mom and pops at home (much as it hurts to admit it). Nice and spicy. Not crazy about the flour tortillas, though they are house made. Kahlua flan was great. Service excellent. I took off half a star because they spell chile with two \"i\"'s. I'll be back for the giant house margarita.
