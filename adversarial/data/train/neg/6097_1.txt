We came in to stand around for about 5-8 minutes waiting to be seated, as there was a huge sign asking us to wait. Many staff members just walked by and then finally asked us if they could help us. My husband and I said yeah, just waiting to be seated like the sign said. After being seated, we orders drinks and an app. Jalape√±o peppers were average at best. We also got a pizza which was good , but took a while to come out. Had to flag down staff to ask for an additional ranch, as they didn't really check on how we were doing. Also had to put our drinks at the very end of the table for more water and even had to ask for our check at the end. In the end, I thought with 4 stars on Yelp we would have much better service.. It was really just average food with not so great service.
