Tracy Riggs is an extremely talented hair stylist. I'm so thankful that I found her! I have been natural for almost 2 years and began going to Tracy about a year ago. She saved my hair! I attempted several times to transition from relaxed to natural hair on my own and was unsuccessful each time. However, under Tracy's expert hair care, my hair is now completely natural and healthier than it's ever been. Beyond her expert hair care, Tracy offers a superb salon experience. She is very professional, never late, works fast and your time during your appointment is not shared. All major pluses in my book! Tracy has done magic on my hair, my daughter's hair and my mother's hair. We are all very satisfied customers! I have tried a number of her services...from a blow out including a steam treatment, color to a custom cut. I have had so many compliments on my hair as well.\nMost recently, Tracy installed a sew-in weave in my hair. I ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT!! My hair blends well with the extensions and looks very natural. The style is very versatile as well. And most importantly, the weave was installed to protect my hair as I continue to grow my hair out. Again, the experience of my appointment was great. She gave me detailed written tips on how to care for my weave, a slick scarf and detangling brush for my hair. I mean who really provides this type of 5 star quality client services anymore?? Tracy Riggs does! Book an appointment today and experience it for yourself!!
