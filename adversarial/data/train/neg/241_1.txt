I have been going here for years and still going as I work nearby.  I typically order by phone and pick up.  For sandwiches, I substitute the wrap for the sub bread. I love the avocado chicken\/tuna salad. Fresh fruit is provided in the salad. The ingredients are fresh. The daily specials are great. The chicken noodle soup has increased in quality from previous years. It is higher priced than the fast food; however, the quality and freshness is great.
