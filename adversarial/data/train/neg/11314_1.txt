My friend's love this place and they took me here.   It's in a strip mall close to Scarborough town centre.   It's definitely quaint... and has a old world feel to it (ie. not modern or renovated) .    The food does kind of taste like eating at grandmas...simple, no frills, home cooking .   \n\nI had the spinach and ham quiche, it was well done but since it was microwaved to warm up it slightly stuck to the plate.  Still a nice slice of quiche with a standard Ceasar salad.    The quiche and salad was $9.99.   The roast beef on a kaiser at $7.99 looked fresh and balanced meat to bun ratio.    \n\nThe desserts stand out.  The strawberry meringue cake was not very sweet at all, just enough to bring out the flavours....and actually quite nice.  \n\nMy friends got the sugar free chocolate cake that was really a very mildly sweetened chocolate mousse in texture.  I normally shy away from sugar free products of any sort, but this was actually really great for a sugar free product, very creamy, great chocolate flavour, and wonderfully balanced.    Pretty much a diabetic's dream dessert.    The cake slices are about $5.50 a slice .    \n\nIt's definitely not inexpensive for the location and decor, but if you enjoy a very unpretentious quite small cafe with old world uncomplicated food, you can get that in a sit down cafe at the price of takeout.   \n\nAlso was wonderfully nice to kids and kid friendly, just call in first because they only have 1 table of 4.....the other tables all seat 2.   \n\nI didn't love it, but this place does have it's merits.
