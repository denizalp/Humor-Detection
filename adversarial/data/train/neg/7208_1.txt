Words cannot express my gratitude for Jim and all of his help. I bought a beautiful pair of Dolce and Gabbana glasses after he took the time to let me try on the whole store! Two days later my puppy destroyed them and I was so glad I had purchased the warranty he recommended for $25. I took them in the next day and he didn't even ask any questions he just said \"don't worry I'll take care of it!\" A week later my frames were on back order for an undetermined amount of time so Jim allowed me to come back and pick out a whole new pair free of charge since we didn't know when the other pair would come in. He also gave me a killer deal on a pair of Prada sunglasses which I adore. Every time I come in to see Jim I feel valued even if he has 10 people in the store, he will always make sure you are well taken care of. Thank you so much for your out of this world customer service, I will never go anywhere else!
