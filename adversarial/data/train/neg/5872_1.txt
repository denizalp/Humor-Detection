Well the wife wanted aged meat for her birthday meal. Based on our past experience several years ago this was the place. Well there is no more aged meats at all. We decided to eat anyway. Clam chowder did actually have clams in it but was more like clams in a watery mashed potato mix. She had a bone-in rib eye 18 ounce steak which looked like it had lost about six ounces while being cooked. Not all that great either. I had the Shrimp Scampi with Linguine. It was far from being shrimp scampi. More like a alfredo sauce.\n\nThis place and other sites on the internet say the pricing is good at between $15-25 dollars per person. Just two lousy ice teas are $7.00. My CUP not Bowl of clam chowder was $7.00. A can of Progresso soup is better and only $1.88 last time i shopped for food. So for the $15-25 you might get 2 drinks (lousy pepsi products, iced tea or lemonade) and a couple appetizers for that amount but you're not going to get anything descent for $15-$25. Just a plain cheeseburger here is $14.00.  Based on our meal a burger at In & Out will taste better and cost only a few dollars if that.\n\nNo plans on ever going back again. For the price I would have rather eaten at Roy's Hawaiian Fusion on Flamingo.\n\nhttp:\/\/www.tripadvisor.com\/ShowUserReviews-g45963-d491198-r275849108-All_American_Bar_Grille-Las_Vegas_Nevada.html#
