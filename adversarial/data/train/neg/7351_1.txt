Ordered take out from curry bowl a few nights ago, and absolutely LOVED everything! We ordered Chicken Tikka Masala, Butter chicken, and Lamb Korma, plus rice and Naan. It was absolutely wonderful! The Tikka was very flavorful and definitely had a kick of spice without being overpowering, and the butter chicken was creamy and delicious. While I didn't eat but a bite or two of the Korma, it was definitely one of the best I've had. The only complaint I have is that the mixed up the labels on the butter chicken and Tikka containers so we ate the Chicken Tikka first thinking it was butter chicken but we're very surprised when it was spicy lol then we realized the mistake and happily continued enjoying the food! No biggie just a bit annoying. Oh also good to note that their Naan is freshly made, so it was light and very fluffy! Definitely going to be getting take out again soon!
