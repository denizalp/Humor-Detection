I came here for my birthday on a weekday.  \n\nFirst thing's first, this is a buffet and while the hosts are nice, there is absolutely no service.  I wasn't checked on once, no one asked if I wanted anything.  It's basically like a serve your self thing and while I wanted some tea, no one even asked me or looked in my direction, so I didn't bother.  \n\nIn terms of the food, the dim sum, the soups and the noodle bar are all very good.  The desserts are also excellent. However, the stir fry\/pan fry, stew stuff is pretty average.   \n\nWhat I liked was that they marked what was vegan and which items had dairy or eggs.  It was very self explanatory.  That was nice.\n\nWhat needs improvement: the salad bar.  There were only four items.  It would have been nice to have a bigger salad selection.\n\nWould I come back? During the weekdays, sure. During the weekends, I don't think so since it's $20, but it might not be out of the question.
