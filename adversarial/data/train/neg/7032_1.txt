The owners here are true animal lovers, and put their hearts fully into this business. They pay it forward in the rescue arena, often using some of their space to provide a respite for those needing forever homes. Isabel the groomer has been practicing for over 30 years. She truly LOVES what she does, has a great sense of humor, and is a total gem to have in the field - I have seen her kiss\/love on animals she is grooming as if they were her own. I don't trust many places to take my furbabies, I have 5 dogs (including one foster) and two cats. Highly recommend this place that makes you feel welcome and like family immediately. One of only places I trust, and I highly recommend! Excellent\/fair prices too! :)
