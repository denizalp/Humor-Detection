It was my second time at David's Bridal. First, I went to David's Bridal Northlake Mall and I didn't have a good experience. I liked their dresses online, so I decided to give David's Bridal a second chance. David's Bridal Pineville-completely different experience! My consultant was a really sweet and helpful girl named Dionna. She brought all the dresses I liked online and helped me with everything! I found my wedding gown! Great!
