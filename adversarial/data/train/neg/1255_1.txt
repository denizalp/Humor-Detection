Absolutely fantastic. I lived in China for a year and grew to love real Chinese food. While the American version is ok, it can't really compare. I try different Chinese places all the time, and was blown away by this one. There are a number of authentic northern chinese dishes on the menu you can't find anywhere else. If you go in at any given time, there will be more Asian customers than white, which goes to show it has great authentic quality.   There just isn't a better authentic Chinese food joint in the East Valley.  I recommend going with a group and getting a bunch of items so everyone can share.
