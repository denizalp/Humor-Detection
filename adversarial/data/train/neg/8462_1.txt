The Cookie Monster and the cookies and cream are both addicting...I think it has something to do with that dangerously good mallow they use to stick candy bits at the top of the cone...soo good!!! All in all I love this plAce, I would only wish they have separate price options for single scoops...I always have to pay full price ($7) for a single scoop because otherwise it is too much for me.......seems a bit unfair....
