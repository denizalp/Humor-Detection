Had a great experience at Rejuvenation Spa! The first time i went, great service, staff is very friendly, lots of products. I got a cut and highlights. I said just a trim and thats just what they did! The color of my highlights matched perfectly. The next day, after styling my hair myself i realized it wasn't exactly how i wanted it ( it needed to be more blonde) i called the salon, and they got me in very quickly to fix it! Now my hair is perfect, will be going back again!
