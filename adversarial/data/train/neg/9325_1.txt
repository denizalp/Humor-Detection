A coworker of mine said I had to try MOD pizza after she found out I had never been, so we went for lunch today. I am very glad she motivated me to give this place a try. The 11'' pizza was the perfect size, tasted amazing, and the service was beyond what I am accustomed to from a quick place to grab lunch. I will definitely be returning. Shout out to the GM (Mike, I think), who made sure our experience was 5 star worthy.
