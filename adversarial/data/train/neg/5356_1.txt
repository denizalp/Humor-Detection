I have not purchased anything from this company but I am writing this review because I was highly impressed by a young gentleman who works with this company.   A bunch of us were going to a Pirates games on the North Shore.   There were several vendors on the street around the stadium.   We visited most of the vendors.  One vendor stood out to me and it was West Shore.   A young man by the name of Zane (I hope that I remembered his name).  Mr. Zane was the nicest gentleman and answered all of our questions.   He was very professional and very kind with his answers. (he was very informed on the company).   What impressed me is that he did not push.   Many times we walk away and refuse to do any busy with pushy associates or sales people.   I will have NOTHING to do with them.  However, after Zane's knowledge - if we decided to get new windows, we will consider this company.   After all Zane got us to really look at the company's website - which is a first step.
