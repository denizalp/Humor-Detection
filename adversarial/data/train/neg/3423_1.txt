It's a cute place for a \"not so quick bite\". I realize they cook everything fresh so don't come in starving because you'll be waiting a bit. The coffee is pretty good. The music is nice. But the one thing this place is missing is a warm welcome with a smile. Everyone that works here looks likes they're in a bad mood. TIP: if you don't enjoy your job find something else. YOU set the tone for everyone that walks through that front door looking for a \"wake me up\" coffee and one of your delicious pastries.
