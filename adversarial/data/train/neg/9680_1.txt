I have been to the one in NYC and this did not disappoint.  Great service, great food and great decor....best meal we had in vegas.\n\nWe started with the parpadelle with ragu  and the clams casino (although they don't call them that on the menu).  The pasta was awesome but the clams were a bit small and had too much breading on them.  \n\nFor the main course I had the Veal Milanese which is my go-to-meal provided it is on the bone and not cutlets.  It was one of the best I have ever had.  Huge portion, perfectly breaded and fried.  I ate 2\/3rds and then my wife had some.\n\nMy wife had the Salted Branzino which was moist and excellent.  She said it was one of the best fish dishes she ever had.\n\nWe ordered a beautiful bottle of Italian white wine but it was advertised as an 2008 and they brought out a 2010.  It was still excellent, but I am always surprised at how many restaurants advertise one vintage and then bring out another.  In this case it really didn't make much different, but it just goes to show that you should always read the label.\n\nGiven the portion sizes along with the free apps (cheese, fried zucchini, etc.) you have to pace yourself or you can easily get filled up before your main course arrives.\n\nYes, it was expensive, but meals like this are always pricey, but, hopefully, worth it.  It was a great experience and you will not be disappointed.
