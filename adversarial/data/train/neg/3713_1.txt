Chino Bandido is one of my favorite local local spots. \n\nUpon arriving, you'll come to the conclusion you might want to turn around. The parking lot is spooky, the restaurant boasts elementary school floor tile and fold-up plastic card tables.\n\nDon't let this fool you. The food here is top dog. The service is hit or miss, really- but the food! The food is like a little Chinese-Mexican warrior came down from space to bless us all with delicious jade red chicken, quesadillas, burritos, nummy rice, mouth-watering cookies (which don't taste half bad dipped into their BLACK BEANS, if your into the savory, sugary thing). \n\nI couldn't say more good things about Chino's food: what restaurants are all about. I could care less if the bathrooms are tight and smell a little funky. The food is great. That's what we care about. \n\nIt's an original, local staple that has been and will be passed down for generations.
