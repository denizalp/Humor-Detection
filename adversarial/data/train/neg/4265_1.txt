I discovered Metro in 1987 after moving here from the East Coast. The little shop on Trop and Flamingo was set up like a drive in theater with a big(at the time)screen tv.\nThe waitress wore bright pink, dangling ball earrings and always greater everyone with a sweet voice and a smile.\nMeals were delicious, affordable and ended with a piece of Bazooka!\nToday the Metro empire has grown to all parts of the Valley. That's a good thing...yes, there is a but. As the company has grown the quality of the meals has dropped. The cost of a pizza is now ridiculous! \nI'm sad. We? the neighborhoods, have made you.\nStrip prices are not the way to thank us.
