Great experience.  Owner went out of his way to be sure everything was perfect.  We did the kayak trip from the dam to Willow beach, and it was very beatiful, and tour was wonderful from start to finish.\n\nMy only reaason for not giving 5 stars,, is on booking we were told it would be a private tour, just him and the 4 of us, however it turned out there were 4 more besides, and we had to wait about a little into our tour, nearly 45 minutes while he picked up the rest of the group, that started later.   \n\nI would still highly recommend this company, and would use them again.
