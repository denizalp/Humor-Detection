First time at the original location. \nLove the restaurant. Classic Mexican food. I ordered a shrimp burrito and it was outstanding! Their rice and beans are exceptionally good as well! \nI also ordered a sangria. Different than what I was expecting-they add orange juice to the wine-but good and refreshing nonetheless! \nWill definitely be back!
