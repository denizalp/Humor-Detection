I love this place. The interior is cute.  The staff is knowledgeable and helpful. Also very patient when I was waiting for a confirmation from my boyfriend as to his order. The hummus box is delicious and the carrot cake smoothie is so delicious you'd be pressed to know it wasn't a calorie laden treat. This place is so good. They also have b12 shots that make you feel great in .02 seconds. Try it. You won't regret it.
