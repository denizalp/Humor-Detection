2nd Time Is A HIT!\nWow, Top Dog Grooming hit it out of the park again.  I took my two girls there for their 2nd grooming at Top Dog on May 26th, 2017 and Connor did an exceptional job once again.  Top Dog is tops with elderly dogs.  If you read my review from 4\/15\/2017 you know that I have one dog that is 13 (Momma) and one that is 9 (Daughter).  The calmness of Momma after the grooming is a first.  With other groomers in Las Vegas she would come home and take a day to calm down.  Not after Top Dog.  Her osteoarthritis did not exacerbate.  Again, no signs of physical or mental stress on my Girls.  Oh, and did I mention that Connors grooming was once again EXCEPTIONAL, oh yeah, I guess I did.  \n\nTop Dog is the best groomer I have gone to since my girls adopted me back in 2008.\n\nThank you Top Dog.\n\nI hope the 3rd and 100th visits are as great as the 1st and 2nd:)
