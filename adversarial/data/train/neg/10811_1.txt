I'm starting to look something like a foodie. It's Queen's Feast aka Charlotte Restaurant Week and I had to try it out. The reason I give it 4 stars is because we still had to wait an extra 30 minutes for our 8:30 reservation to get seated. The best part was our waiter Jake who took very great care of us. He went through the entire menu with us and took the time explain what is what. It's $30 for a 4 course meals including a margarita so go before it's over. I will definitely be returning.
