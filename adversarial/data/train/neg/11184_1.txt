I've been to this theater twice: once in 2011 and again this past week. The Brenden Theater is a great place to catch a movie while in Las Vegas - my boyfriend and I went to kill some time before our return flights to San Antonio. The theater is located off the strip at the Palms but it's a quick taxi ride and the hotel also has restaurants and a casino. This past weekend the theater was just as good as when we came two years ago. $8 for matinee, comfy seats that recline, clean bathrooms and a food court right outside (Earl of Sandwich, Nathan's Famous Hotdogs, McDonalds, Famiglia Pizza and more) where you can fill up your tummy before seeing a movie. We checked our luggage at the front desk and settled in for the Wolf of Wall Street - great movie theater experience. (The theater has regular movie theater concessions but they are typical movie price - almost $6 for a small popcorn!! I recommend eating at the food court instead).
