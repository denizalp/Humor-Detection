Let me just start by saying the food here is pretty good. The wife and I have gone a few times for Happy Hour, the first time we got in really quick due to our friends who had gotten there earlier and got themselves on the list. The second time, we had to wait an hour and a half. The whole time we were waiting, they had at least 4 seats at the bar. WHAT THE FUCK? If anything breaks this place down it's the service. They're obviously understaffed for the amount of people they have to serve. They have two bartenders. Those bartenders are the servers as well. They have to serve 6 or so different tables plus those who are at the bar not to mention, they're making drinks for everyone in the dinner sections which is a lot more people. (I'm assuming they take care of the drinks for those in the dinner section but I'm not 100% certain) The last 25 or so minutes they had a table, which eventually were we seated at, empty. I just don't understand what the Silverton is doing. They had great beer throughout the place and took it all away and replaced it with garbage. They haven't even replaced their Dogfish Head 90 minute IPA tap which has been out for at least 9 weeks. HEY, F&B Manager, THE CUSTOMERS FUCKING MATTER! Okay back to Twin creeks. My main gripe with this place is that they are understaffed. They should have two bartenders and at least extra server. I am certain it would speed things up and everyone would be happier. The bartender, Tim, understands but you can only apologize so many times and especially in such a casual manner but realistically that doesn't mean anything because it keeps happening. \n\nThis is a great tapas restaurant (since that is all I have had here, never been here for dinner), but if you go to Happy Hour, be prepared to wait forever and have crappy ass service.
