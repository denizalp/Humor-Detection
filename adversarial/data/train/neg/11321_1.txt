Fat Tuesdays a MUST every time you go to Vegas! It's almost like a tradition everyone knows of. \n\nI had the Bloody Smurf & this one was delicious! Very sweet! If you liked those icee popsicles when you were a kid then definitely get this one! \n\nI added an extra shot to give it a boost but it was still a little too \"weak\" for me + I got a bad headache afterwards :\/ I'll be trying another flavor next time! \n\nCome early if you can! The line can get really long!
