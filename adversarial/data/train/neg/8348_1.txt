I did not even know this place was on DDD before I tried it today! I have not had much experience with Thai food before, but I did enjoy trying this place out. I sat outside and it was nice, not too crowded on a Wednesday night.\nOur orders were taken pretty quickly, I can't remember the name of the dish I ordered, but it was tofu and vegetables in a coconut broth. Was served in a metal bowl that had a flame in the middle which was pretty crazy. Was a little bit difficult for me to ladle the soup from the metal thing into the bowl without making a huge mess. But it went ok! The food was delicious. It was not spicy at all though. Also there were a few slices of what looked like potato in there, and it wasn't potato. It was sliced ginger, and eating that big of a hunk of ginger is not really a pleasant experience. Otherwise, I enjoyed it! Was not too expensive, I'm sure it would be a great place to come for lunch too.
