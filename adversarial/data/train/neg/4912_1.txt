Favorite breakfast place in Phoenix\/Scottsdale, BY FAR!\n\nI know it's technically a chain and there are original pancake houses everywhere, but it's great. You can't go wrong with good 'ol fashion pancakes, I mean come on. \n\nTheir 49er flapjacks are on point! Thin and made perfectly. \nWhen I don't get those, I indulge in just their basic pancakes - I haven't been anywhere else that can make basic pancakes as fantastic as this place. \n\nThey are usually pretty busy, but be patient, the wait is super fast!
