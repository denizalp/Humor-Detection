Pho is not bad.  I've only been in Calgary for a couple of months and have had pho at 3 different places--can't go wrong with Pho Pasteur the broth is hot, not too salty, but still enough flavour to taste home made (unlike some places that just drop a packet of artificial flavoured\/MSG-boosted pho).
