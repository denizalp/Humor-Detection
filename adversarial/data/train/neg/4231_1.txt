Nothing overly specular, food was average in taste and quality but over priced for sure. Strangely, most of the dishes sported a bitter aftertaste that's hard to describe. Tried it on a whim, but 4 dishes split between four people and still leaving the restaurant with a $25 bill before tip make my question my life choices... Worth a try once of you've got the money to blow, ehh
