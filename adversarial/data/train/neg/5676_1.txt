Thus far, best Pho in Vegas! Not too far from the Strip, inexpensive, close to the airport,  decent service.\n\nBeing local, the fam and I frequent this place when we are in the mood for Pho or Bahn Mi sandwiches. Always on point. Their egg rolls are amazing too! Been to several others around town and the broth here is such a level above the others. Sooo good!\n\nHope that you give this place a shot. It is well worth it!
