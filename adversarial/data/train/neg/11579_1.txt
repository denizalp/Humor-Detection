this is very bland, Americanized Mexican food. I had the stacked enchiladas, with fideo as a side.... i gotta say the fideo was REALLY good, but.. well. it's hard to mess up fideo!  Otherwise, the salsa tastes like raw tomato sauce, the enchiladas were far less than spectacular, and the guacamole we ordered was similar to what could be had at any grocery store. There are so many more exciting, fresher tasting, less expensive Mexican eateries in the area, so I don't have any plans on returning to Rosita's.
