I had to get my drive clean test for my minivan...\n\n1. Great friendly service \n2. Quick...I was out of there in 40 min (whereas when I took this last year to a local Toyota dealership I was there for over 2 hours. ..low priority because littke to no money made on a dct)?\n3. Open on the weekends and no appointments necessary\n4. Can kill time in local shops\n5. I passed!!
