This restaurant has one of the most unique themes I have ever seen: school. It is so fun and unique, and the place is huge so it is great for parties. They went all out on the atmosphere; even the menus are composition notebooks. They have a nice menu with not too much selection or variety, and the price is on the pricier side. I came here with 10 of my friends on a Saturday for brunch and they do have a bottomless mimosa special for $10. I ordered eggs and grits, and the top of the dish was very good, but the grits were meh. It tasted kind of funny, so I didn't finish it. My friend's dishes seemed appetizing though. The servers were very kind and attentive and made sure we had refills. Overall I would give the theme, originality, and atmosphere 5 stars, but food and selection 3 stars.
