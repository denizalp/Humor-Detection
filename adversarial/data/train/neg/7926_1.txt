I was a patient of Dr. Rubenzik for a few years before I moved out of state in 2013, and she had always been great, so I was delighted to schedule a check-up in the beautiful new Scottsdale offices when I moved back. The front desk staff was delightful when I checked in; however, they did not know that I had already completed all my forms a couple of weeks prior via Zocdoc, and I too had forgotten until I had nearly completed them. So if you do that, be sure to make a note of it at check-in. Zocdoc sends the patient a reminder to this effect, but the text message arrived too late--during my appointment. I was disappointed not to get to see Dr. Rubenzik, but her PA Juliette McCaffrey was pleasant and knowledgeable and I understand that is the most efficient use of the doctors' time when there is no significant medical issue. She did seem a bit rushed, although I would give her the benefit of the doubt as it was an end of day appointment and I did have a lot of questions. I will be going back for two consultations on cosmetic derm services, so I will post more info after those visits.
