We love the staff here! We've been coming just about every Saturday and they always remember us\/our names\/our orders! Carol is so sweet to greet us when we walk in and when we leave: not just a general\n\"hello\/good morning\" but something genuine.  The FOOD - you MUST get the seasoned potatoes! I've personally tried a variety of omelettes and all the other types of breakfast dishes and I've yet to have anything I didn't like. Ethan likes the \"Jayden\" off the kids menu, but he subs our the ham for bacon and no cheese. The kitchen staff always gets it just right and never makes us feel badly for customizing an order (thank goodness, bc kids are difficult at times!) haha. \nThis place is always busy, so don't be surprised! They seat you pretty quickly, so don't worry!
