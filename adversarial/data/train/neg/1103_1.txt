I've been coming here for the past 6 years for take out or eat in.  Mostly I do the Take out,\nwhich the food is exceptional!  Food quality is great, and I'm always happy with my meal.  I recommend the Moo Shu Pork or Shrimp.  Pupu Platter Excellent.\n\nOn top of that this is a hardworking family owned business and the whole family is really nice and they always remember you and make you feel welcome.  \n\n Highly recommend!
