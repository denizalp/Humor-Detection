Personally I hate shopping (no one could tell by looking at my wardrobe) and this store is the very reason. The girls in the store profile individuals that come into the store, only helping those that look the part. I dress well I have been a Manager and a Buyer for some high end stores. I came from a spin class just showered, hat on joggers on looking for a gift for my sister. She had just graduated and wanted to get her some professional clothing as she starts her life as a adult. I had a couple of pieces in hand no one asked if I wanted to try things on (not that I did), I do not even recall someone saying Hi. I left with nothing that morning. Later that evening myself and my boyfriends went in (dress nicely as we were going for dinner later) and got the complete opposite. Spent $800 on that little girls cause the young lady helping me was so GREAT!
