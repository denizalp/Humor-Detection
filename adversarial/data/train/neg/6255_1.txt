3.5 \n\nYou've seen it on Instagram, but have you ventured inside? Was at Yorkdale on a weekday evening and there was no wait for a table, so I decided to try out the RH Courtyard Cafe for dinner (they don't accept reservations as of a few weeks ago).\n\nIt is as pretty as it looks online - lovely fake trees, marble tables, ambient lighting - it's amazing. The servers are also quite helpful and friendly. \n\nAfter being seated I looked at the menu....yikes this place was expensive. Still I wanted to see if it was worth all the hype. \n\nI ordered a truffle grilled cheese which came with your choice of salad or fries. Decided on fries because why not. The meal was prepared quite fast which is a plus. \n\nOk - the grilled cheese was huge - very large portion - plus the fries - I was not able to finish my meal in its entirety. The flavours were nice, the truffle oil was a refined touch - I felt like maybe it was almost too heavy? My friend got a burger and said it was pretty good too. \n\nI've heard the scrambled eggs are good - I'm willing to try that again next time. They also have cold pressed juices, pastries, coffees etc. everything is priced from $5 (lattes), to $25 (meals). \n\nWould I go often? Probably not because it's too pricey. This is a once in a while type of thing. It does meet the hype expectations though so if you've been waiting to try it out then go for it!
