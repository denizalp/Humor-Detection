I've been here many times now and have tried a few vegetarian dosas. I liked the chana masala and the onion rava masala, but my favorite is by far the mushroom masala (8.50$). All dosas come with sambar and chutney - delicious! The potato bondas are also amazing as an appetizer (3$ for 2). The only negative experience I had was when my friend ordered the spinach and lentil dish. It was 8.50$ but was very small and bland. The rice was an extra 3$. Basically, I would recommend sticking to the dosas, as that's their specialty. Staff are friendly, service is great, and it's BYOB. I highly recommend it!
