I went to AW Collision after being rear-eneed in my 2016 Cadillac. Wendy was very helpful and Teresa took care of my vehicle. Teresa was great to work with and wanted to make sure that I was satisfied with all of my repairs. Even tough I have my car back, Teresa is still working with the other person\"'s insurance company to work through the repairs and the costs associated with the rental car. Key Insurance was the other insurance carrier and has been a nightmare for Myself, Teresa, and my attorney, Adam McClausky, to work with. My husband has stage 4 cancer and they all made sure that there were no unnecessary trips or panic associated with the entire issue. Thank You Guys!!
