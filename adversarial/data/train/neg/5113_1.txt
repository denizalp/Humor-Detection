As an Indian desperately missing his cuisine, this was the first Indian place i tried in tempe and boy was it wonderful! Completely satisfied my craving for Indian food and left a lovely aftertaste in my mouth. The bill came up to $45 between the six of us and thats extreme value for money. And the dishes were authentically indian. The decor is like from some 60's bollywood movie but nothing u cant get over and eat.Recommended
