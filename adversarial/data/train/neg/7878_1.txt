I had breakfast here, and was not disappointed.  For the same price as breakfast anywhere at a sit down place, it was well worth the price.\n\nMy favorite part was Manny, the omelette chef.  He made fresh omelettes, or eggs any way you wanted them...and he put on quite the show.  After he added all my ingredients to the eggs, he tossed them high in the air...and then caught them all back in the pan w\/o so much as a drop spilling.  It was great.  Very much worth leaving the guy an extra tip.\n\nThere were all the staples of a breakfast bar there.  Lots of meats, eggs (i suggest waiting in line for the fresh made omelette), blintzes, potatoes, pancakes, pastries, fruit, yogurt. etc.  Nothing fancy, but lots of choices.
