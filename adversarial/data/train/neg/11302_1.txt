Everytime I come here, the staff is the sweetest. They make me feel like family. They serve you a complimentary glass of milk and tea biscuits and house made granola--what could be better??\n\nI will say the options are limited, but I've never been disapppinted. Their savory crepes are some of the best I've E V E R had. Also 10\/10 on presentation. You can probably find cheaper crepes around, but you are paying for the quality here. \n\nThe location makes it hard to find and you'll want to experience this place when it's not too busy to get the full effect. It's on the smaller side and fills up fast. Also be sure to check the hours because they close early! But I recommend Crepe Bar over every other nearby Crepe spot in tempe. So it's worth the effort friends. IT IS WORTH THE EFFORT.
