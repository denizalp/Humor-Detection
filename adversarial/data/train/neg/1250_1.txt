A beautiful hotel and casino.\n\nI only stayed here a couple of nights but the experience was phenomenal. The rooms are very elegant and comfortable. The room service might be pricey but very good. I always came back to a clean tidy room (always a plus). \n\nThe whole place is great. You definitely have to experience their canals, complete with gondolas. You will likely run into some great performers throughout.  \n\nGreat great place
