One postal worker working again today. There were 6 people in line and never requested additional help. Took 15 mins to ship one $19 flat rate box. I want to support the USPS but they are making it impossible. I'll be using ups or fedex from now on. Also... a letter has been sitting in my mailbox for 3 days now. Our postal worker for the neighborhood just drives by our house.... Good old government postal workers.
