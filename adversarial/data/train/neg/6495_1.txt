Ah, the Meat Sciences lab. Great fresh meat for really good prices. The mailing list is a must, as they update you with weekly or bi-weekly messages that explain exactly what they have for sale, and they often include stuff they don't have all the time (for instance, when they slaughter a bunch of pigs, they let you know so you can pre-order pork loin). \n\nIt's my goal in life to order a beef side when they get cattle in (yes, you can order AN ENTIRE SIDE OF BEEF), but it's so much fun to drop in and see what they have. Plus, sometimes they can help you find stuff that doesn't appear in the Meat Mail email; I went in once and got a cut of brisket out of the freezer even though it wasn't behind the counter. They're always ready to help.
