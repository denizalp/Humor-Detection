I always travel around to different nail salons out of convenience to what's close to me at the time. I looked up this salon which usually this chain has a great reputation. Beachwood locations are great! Well not this location! I understand it may have been luck of the draw and I got the worst technician in there, but it's enough for me to never step foot in there again! He painted all over my skin and never cleaned it up! Since I got shellec polish it is now glued to my skin. He also pulled out a drill to use on all my nails. You don't use a drill on shellec polish!! That's the point of the \"new\" hot manicure out there is it's gentler on your nails then acrylics ever were!! He was so rude! It was a complete waste of $43. It took everything in my body to stiff him on the tip, I managed to muster up the courage to hand his poor soul $4. Worst nail experience ever!!! Plus as I was checking out I saw a hand printed sign reviewing with all it's customers that there on no refunds on services even if you aren't happy. Seems like they have had this issue many times in the past. A business that is already stating they may make you unhappy before you even begin your service probably is not worth it! Drive somewhere else, this place made me so unhappy :(
