Don't trust them for a business lunch.\n\nGot a reservation for a Friday on the patio, I was told that 11am would be the latest time I would be able to get a reservation but the patio was confirmed 3 times over the phone. Coming here with 8 employees, we got in around 1050 just ensure we got our spot on the patio, unfortunately there was only 4 seats available outside. When we went in to be seated at our reserved patio table we were told \"ohh there is no tables....\", confused the hostess walked away and started asking the others about our table. No table was provided and while the hostess went to retrieve the manager, the remaining patio seats were filled and there was absolutely nowhere for us to sit. The manager arrived to tell us that they do not take reservations for the patio but they could sit us in the very back of the bar.... We did not want to sit at the back of the bar, we had reserved the patio because it was a nice day. The manager tried to convince us to sit in the back, we did not get any help from the manager and in fact this whole waiting ordeal cost us the remaining patio seats. This place is fine if you want to go get a drink or two but it is definitely not a place I would feel confident about when trying to have a business lunch or dinner.
