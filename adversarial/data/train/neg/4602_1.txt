I went when this first opened had a free Coupon went okay.  Went today and my Driver Side front tire Hub Cap got caught in the line machine and backing out to line up bent it so aggravated you need to Have a Manager on-site had to go to Discount Tire to see if the bent up hub cap was not puncturing my tire. Last time I come here!\n\nUPDATE: \nIt has been exactly one Week!!!!Days no word from the Manager at this Location!  Yes I received a Message from Messenger I think from there main office!
