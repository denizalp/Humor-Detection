There is always a long line to get a table, but that 's no surprise due to the location and the touristy thing to do. Ordered the smoked meat sandwich that the portion of the meat was a lot which made the taste of the sandwich very tasty. There is no time to sit around and chat who you go there with it's more of a eat your food and leave so they can sit the next group to eat. There aren't a lot of tables and you do have to share tables which I have no problems with. My over all experience was good and would probably get my food to go at their to go store right next door, but keep in mind even the to go store has a long line.
