Roy's turned out to be a good choice for dining while staying at the JW Marriott, but I'm unsure if I  would venture out here otherwise. We came here for dinner and enjoyed an excellent bottle of German Riesling to accompany the Hawaiian ahi poke, which was good but nothing incredible. The lobster roll we ordered also was quite underwhelming, ranking as below average sushi in my opinion. Roy's definitely ended the evening with a high note with the warm chocolate souffl√© and the pineapple upside-down cake, I really enjoyed both of these desserts. Overall, it was a nice evening, but I think the experience fell a little short of our high expectations.
