My favorite go to place. Found them when I first moved here and was over hungry and starving\nOrder a bunch of menu items way more than I could eat but all were great\nMy favorites are the Perfect Pear Grilled Cheese and Perfect Pear Salad\nMy favorite is the Priest location in Tempe\nAlways great service and get the changes I need made to my order
