I love this place!  It definately has the nicest decor of any Thai restaraunt in the area. It is extremely large, open and clean.  The great part is the food is delicious as well.  There are a lot of good Thai restaurants in the valley, but this is my favorite.  Why?\n\nI love peanut sauce!  Their Swan Thai is one of my favorite dishes.  Thin slices of flavorful tender beef drowning in peanut sauce, serves over fresh spinach leaves and crispy rice noodles.  They also serve a very spicy and delicious Tom Yum Goong.  I love their appetizers as well, but I was sad to find out they don't have Thai Toast.\n\nPad Thai is a pretty boring dish in general, but they pull it off nicely. It is flavorful and it doesn't taste like a big pile of mush.  They actually adhere to their Heat level.  They go from 1-5 and a 3 is actually a 3.  Go 5 and it will burn your face off (in a good way).  \n\nFor desert, they are one of the few that service sticky rice with custard!  I love it with coconut ice cream, mangos, but with custard its the best.  They have a very large menu, so I always get to try new things.  I have never had a bad experience there yet.
