For people who are not into all you can eat hotpot, this would be the right place. But it's hard to not over order! Did not finish all the food that was ordered even though I came on an empty stomach. \n\nThe beef oil spicy hotpot base at medium spicy level was extremely spicy. This is coming from some who is addicted to spicy food. \n\nThe tomato beef bone soup base is just right. Didn't dip any of my food in sauce because it's just so awesome on its own. \n\nAt many points throughout the Sunday evening, there was more waitresses standing around than customers. Service was very quick. \n\nEverything about this hotpot place is good. But nothing particularly stood out.
