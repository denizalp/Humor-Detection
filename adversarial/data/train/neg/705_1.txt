For a Vegas nightclub, they seem to be able treat people like humans. \n\nFirst, every bodyguard\/usher\/attendant was charming, courteous. I was escorted to a nice back room area to rest my tired feet when I was done dancing. It also had a bar with the sweetest funniest female bartender. This room had it's own DJ, that needed to learn about avoiding dead air. Many a gaps between songs. Poor guy was booed. But he wasn't the dance floor dj. Maybe it was a practice room. \n\nMain dance floor has many levels. Djs don't over do the songs, will play a song for aboutu 2 minutes and switch it up. It didn't seem as though they chose a genre other than the most fun and danceable songs that cut across the genres.  Music is loud but not too bassy and not too ear piercing....you could still talk to your group if need be.  \n\nThe thing I don't like is the gawkers who stand around certain dancers on the dance floor. If ya gonna be on the dance floor, ya best be dancin'! And of course, the club has the creepy vegas dudes who wanna just come up and dance because they like your skirt, or lips or hair or whatever! \n\nI didn't pay, was told girls don't pay, guys do, and I was also given a free gift -  a pretty lounge dress.  Sorry guys!
