Most crowded bar I've ever been to on a Sunday. My experience there left me feeling very overwhelmed.. We started with margaritas at the Hefe on Mill and then Uber'd our way on up to the one in Old Town Scottsdale. \nI think if this bar was in a smaller city it would be more fun; just too many people for such a small spot. Or management might want to think about having a limit on how many people at one time.... It was ridiculous.
