At the south-east side of Yonge\/Dundas, the ground level of this microbrewery+restaurant is consistently busy. I've been here several times mostly for its convenient location and options for beer. I particularly enjoy the white, blonde, and IPA beers. This place gets a lot of attention because you can order 4.5 oz taster glasses to try various brews. While decent, the beer here isn't by any means \"the best\" in the city. \n\nFood-wise, I've had the 3 Brewers Beer Chaser (medley of fried dill pickles, zucchini batons, breaded provolone, and potato twists for $10), chicken wings ($12), and Carbonade Flammande ($17). The portions leave more to be desired, especially for the price point ($85 before taxes for two people having 2 pints each and some appetizers). Taste of the food is like any other place like Jack Astor's or Boston Pizza. \n\nI really don't think Ryerson students frequent here often. This is more if you want to bring a family member or friend for a tourist experience in the heart of the city. You will have a good time, but you can find better places for the \"microbrewery\" experience. Since the food isn't amazing, you may just come here for drinks after having dinner elsewhere.
