Shopping is so much more fun when I stop in here! I've stopped in a couple times and had great food and drinks with friendly service for pretty good prices. The meat and cheese board and the flatbreads are really good, the one flatbread I really liked was a special but the mushroom is good too. They have a large tv over a fireplace and some small circular booths perfect for two people. A cold glass of white wine when it's hot out and you can take a break from shopping and just people watch and keep ordering small plates, what's not to like.
