Everytime I leave here, I regret it.\n\nYet in a few days, all I do is crave it.\n\nAs long as you aren't afraid of gut-bombing, coma-inducing, delicious Asian-Mexican Fusion, I recommend Chino Bandido with much enthusiasm.  Why is this not a combination more often seen is the question I beg to ask.\n\nThe decorum itself is dive-ier than dive, in fact, it resembles a soup kitchen more than a restaurant, but what it lacks in outward appeal, it more than makes up for in tummy-warming, lip-smacking, mmmmhmmmmmm-inducing goodness.\n\nFor food, I love the Jade Red Chicken and the Pollo Diablo in a Burrito (ask for black beans + Jerk Fried Rice in the burrito too!).  If you are unsure what you want, there are samples ready to be shared so that you can try out any of the menu's delicious items.  The black beans here must have illicit drugs in them because they are so addictive and the jerk fried rice is a perfect accompaniment.\n\nHighly recommended, love this place, going to head there now!
