I made my 1st visit to the \"Happy Dog\" at the Euclid Tavern. Of course I had a hot dog with pulled pork and cheese and one topped with sloppy joe and brie cheese,odd combo I know, that's whats makes this place great, the combinations of hot dog toppings are infinite not to mention the plump all beef franks are very hearty. The side of well cooked tater tots was a nice touch, also  available to be topped with whatever you like up to and including fruit loops!  While I averted the fruit loops, its just nice to know that its there if you're feeling adventurous. Its a really good spot for hangover food, drinks and apparently they have live music there because we sat in front of what appeared to be a stage. Whenever I get back to Cleveland I will make a visit for sure.
