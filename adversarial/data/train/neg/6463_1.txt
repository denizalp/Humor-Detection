They are trying hard and very nice but the food simply was not that good. We tried the scallop appetizer, very odd vanilla flavor and small portion, and then the shrimp tacos again only 2 small shrimp per taco and lacking flavor. I would have liked to give a better review and would try again if I see reviews where the food has improved but until then staying away.
