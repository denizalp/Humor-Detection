My 3 kids have been going to this office for the past year, and they love to see the dentist. Everyone is very sweet, we never have a long wait. They are also very helpful last year I took all the kids myself(husband was deployed)my 7 year old twins were put under for cavity fill and teeth extraction, and my 3 year old fell asleep watching a movie so I had three kids who needed to be carried to the car, the dentist and the staff helped me carry my kids to the car and buckle them up! My family would recommend to all family and friends.
