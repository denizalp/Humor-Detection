This has got to be one of my favourite places to eat at. The best food item on their menu in my opinion is the Squash Poutine. Although all the other items I've tried here have always been good as well. This place does not disappoint and the food is very reasonably priced. My husband and I ordered 5 items on the menu and our bill was only around $45! \n\nWe usually go on a weekend and this place is packed and we always end up having to sit at the bar. This time we visited on a Monday and were finally able to find a seat at the tables. The only thing that bothered me on this visit was that there was water leaking from the ceiling right next to my seat. Other than that the service here is pretty good every time I've been and the food comes out very quickly! I highly recommend this place.
