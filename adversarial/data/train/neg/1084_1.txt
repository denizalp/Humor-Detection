Dr. Henderson has always been top dog when it comes to vets!  Not only has he been donating his time for years and years to sterilize strays, which in itself has made a very noticeable difference in the community's stray population, but, he helped me with two strays that were dropped off at his clinic, which I adopted, and got them their shots up to date so they could go to a new home.  Doc Henderson is a caring and compassionate individual and I will be taking my pets to him for years to come!
