I fell in love with sushi samba a few years back in new york, so I had to check out the LV location. This time around it was just as good, if not better. I love the lively ambiance, and the service is wonderful. We decided to get the Omakase, and my favorite had to be the Chilean Sea Bass served with peruvian corn.  SOOOOO good.  Another favorite was the yellowtail taquitos. They're small but very delicious. The oysters and king crab legs were extremely fresh, and we also had a plate of sashimi in various sauces. The sauces were all citrusy (i.e. yuzu) and weren't for my taste but good nonetheless. \nOne drawback: too full for dessert.
