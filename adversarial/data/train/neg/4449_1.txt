Every single time we go, no matter what time of day, they are out of more item. And that's just the beginning. The food is almost always subpar. I go to the location in Parma that is ALWAYS good. So it's not like I'm choosing food I don't like. It's so close to home so it's convenient but seriously. Get it together. I know Panera can do well, I love their food. This location is just garbage.
