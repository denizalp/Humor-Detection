This new coffee shop\/ bar is located in the Assembly Chef's Hall. Everyone there is really friendly, and they have really talented baristas that will make you a mean beverage. I've only ordered non alcoholic beverages as I make it out to Tokyo Smoke during my coffee breaks at work. The Tokyo Smoke is well known for their Cannabis products and Caffeine. I've tried many of their hot beverage and I would highly recommend their Smokeaccino or their Beet Mint. Warning!! They are both delicious and you might finish them in a jiffy. The Smokeaccino has a smokey and cappuccino fused flavour. The Beet Mint has a unique blend of beet and mint and is non caffeinated if you are looking for a decaffeinated option. You should pay them a visit and I am sure you will have a great experience.
