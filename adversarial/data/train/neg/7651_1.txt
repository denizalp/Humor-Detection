My fiance and I just moved into the area with little more than a bed and box spring to our name. Long story short, we were in desperate need for some furniture.\n\nDesperation however doesn't mean we aren't picky about quality, or looks, and here we were able to find a plethora of products here offering both. Seriously, this building is pretty large and is packed corner to corner with items. \n\nThe items that we purchased are sturdy and seem to be great quality. The customer service was outstanding as well, and they even delivered the items to us themselves the next day for a small fee. \n\nAll I can say is it was a great experience all around and as we can add more to our tiny apartment this will be the first place we come from now on. \n\nOh, but guys if you're reading this I noticed when setting the stand in the right spot that the leg has a chip in the bottom of it. No biggie, but you might want to consider getting something to protect it when moving. Food for thought. Thanks again!
