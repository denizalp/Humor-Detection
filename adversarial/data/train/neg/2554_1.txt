So let's start with this.  If you agree to do a service at a price, do not call me the next day saying we're not going to do it unless you agree to a much more expensive service option.  That is both dishonest and shady business.  You agreed to do the service at a stated price.  You even confirmed it with your service manager.  Remember back when people would honor their word?\n\nI asked if they needed to wait until their tech was going to be in the neighborhood for other service calls, and they said no, they just wouldn't come out unless I agreed to one of their much more expensive ($140 vs $50) service options.\n\nShameful business practices.
