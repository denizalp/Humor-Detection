I am so happy to report my experience at this Wal Mart, Sight to Store, or as the sign read, \"Pickup Center\". I have never been treated as kindly and efficiently as at this place in the store. A young cheerful woman by the name \"Emerald\" helped me in retrieving my order. Best experience I've ever had at a Wal Mart store. Genuine helpfulness. Doesn't get and better than that. \nWal Mart has a program in which they recognize employees who stand out. \"Emerald\" is a true gem at this store and I hope management will read this post and bring her to the spotlight in that program. Thanks Emerald, for helping to make this a bright spot in my day.
