This place is ok, the burgers were good I just personally thought the bun had a little to much grease. \nI love that they have the coke machine and you can add flavors to your drink. The restrooms are in the back and are fairly clean. The service I will say was great, everyone was very nice and helpful. The fries were tasty \nI'm not sure if I would make the trip all the way over here for them especially with so many other food choices but the food was ok and the service in my opinion was awesome.
