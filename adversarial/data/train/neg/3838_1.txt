Just completed a walk and tour of the property and must say, I'm impressed. Ms.Valez was totally professional,  took her time and made me feel extremely comfortable with the process. The apartments are more expensive than the vegas norm, but are well deserved. Summerlin has an upscale feel to it so you have to pay to stay. Looking forward to calling this place home.
