We wanted pizza for dinner last night but were looking for something a little different. While browsing local pizza shops online, I came across Vocelli's menu and noticed the Mac and cheese pizza. As soon as I told my boyfriend he said GET IT! Haha. We took advantage of the online ordering which was a bit hard to navigate but it turned out okay. \n\nWe ordered the Mac and cheese pizza, and were surprised that we could further customize the pizza, so we did! We got buffalo sauce instead of traditional pizza sauce.  I also got a garden Della casa salad with ranch dressing and we decided to try the spinach and mushroom roll ups appetizer.\n\nThe pizza was BOMB. The Mac and cheese could for sure stand on its own, I was surprised and relieved that it was actually good mac and cheese! If you're into spice, I'd absolutely recommend subbing the buffalo sauce!! Also, the pizza was not greasy AT ALL and the crust was soft and tasted very fresh!\n\nThe garden salad was DELICIOUS, pretty, and VERY fresh. It looked just like the picture online. I requested no black olives and there were indeed no olives in the salad. The dressing was a packet of Ken's ranch, and I do prefer homemade ranch but I think Ken's is very good as well so I wasn't disappointed. They also included a package of plastic cutlery which was nice.\n\nWe both really enjoyed the spinach roll ups. They were a bit greasy but we expected that. The flavor was excellent; spinach, mushroom, cheese, and lots of garlic! I believe there were 9 roll ups in the order, along with a side of pizza sauce. \n\nThe delivery was scheduled for 6:04 (30 minutes from our order submission) and the driver was at our door at 6:05! He was very friendly and the food was piping hot (and the salad was nice and cold). We will definitely be ordering from here again!
