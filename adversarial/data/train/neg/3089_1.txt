I'm new to the raw lifestyle. I was a southern girl when it came to breakfast. So I woke up hungry this morning. I wanted something filling; but healthy. I called in the Flying Lucy smoothie and the biblical breakfast. OMG! I was not prepared for this. I feel so much life from his food. It's GOOD. I taste everything in he meal. The bananas are sweet and flavorful. The sliced citrus is juicy. He spread in the vegan bread mixed with the nuts give a tasty hearty bite! Plus drizzled with sweet honey\/syrupy goodness! And the ingredients in the smoothie is so refreshing. This feels so much better than processed oatmeal or cream of wheat and scrambled eggs. I'm LVING his new lifestyle. One day at a time!
