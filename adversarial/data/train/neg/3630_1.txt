Picea is a cute neighbourhood restaurant with friendly staff and good food, not great, but fine. Food prices are average for a nice restaurant but the wine list is ridiculous. If I remember correctly the cheapest bottle of wine was $40.00 or $45.00!! Seems to me prices should reflect the restaurant - so, not an upscale trendy spot, but a good neighbourhood place nicely decorated with good food. These days it's so easy to get good reasonably priced wine, both red and white, around the $10.00 - $12.00 price range (and even cheaper) so there is no excuse for not having at least one bottle of something in the low to mid twenty dollar range. \n\nThe restaurant business is a tough competitive business, better to not alienate your customers by trying to put on airs!
