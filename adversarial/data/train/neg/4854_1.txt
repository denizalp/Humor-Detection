It's nice not to chase the truck around town. Got here on the second day of soft opening. Nice decor. High tech menu board. Simple menu of five specialty burgers and a few additional items. Went with the Kinoko Burger because of the mushrooms and teri sauce. Flavor was spot on. Fries were crispy. Food took a while to come out but it was worth the wait. The owner, Noel, is a friend. Was nice seeing him there. Good luck, Bro. Nice job! This location is on Jones in China Town in front of 168.
