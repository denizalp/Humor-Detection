Having been going to \"The Brew\" since it opened.. food is great.. location is good..\n\nProblem is that it is loved to death.. needs a face lift.. it's kinda of like that favorite pair of jeans you just hate to trash.. but not ready to accept reality. \n\nWay to many folks here.. and expect to wait at least 35 to 1:15 min especially during Friday to Monday during the winter season.\n\nAlso, forget trying to call in for take out... all you get is a busy signal or get hung up, on as the staff is working as hard as they can.. \n\nNeed a larger place, more staff and a much better take out system.\n\n4 stars for food.. 3 stars for service, 1 star for take out and minus 2 stars for size and overcrowding..\n\nSorry.. just have to say it like it is....
