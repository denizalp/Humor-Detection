I live in the neighbourhood. I go to this shoppers at least once a week. The staff are friendly and are always helpful if I need help finding something. \n\nI buy most of my cosmetics there. I use benefit, smashbox and estee lauder. There is a good selection of all three. Gelerah, the in house makeup artist is my go to girl if I want to deviate from my usual regimen. She has spent a lot of time with me and always steers me in the right direction with product selection.
