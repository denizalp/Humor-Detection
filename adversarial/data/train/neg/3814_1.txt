This little pub has a great beer selection, and is one of the few pubs in the city that carries my favorite beer - Urthel Hop-it. A lot of beers on tap and it also manages to have a nice bottle selection even though quite a few of the bottles on the menu are out of stock and have been for a long time. The food is nothing special, typical stuff. The staff are a mixed bag, some are very friendly and helpful while others are downright rude and amateurish. By sitting at the bar I've over-heard a few of the waiters rip into their patrons in a harsh manner when they grab the drinks for them. It got to the point once where I wanted to approach the patrons and tell them what I had over-heard so they won't tip them, but I didn't want to ruin anyone's good time. Most of the staff aren't knowledgeable in the world of beer either. The prices for some of the bottles of beer (especially that of the Trappist variety) are the best in the city, hands down. It's a nice set up inside, 2 floors, 2 bars, but the patio in the summer is too packed full of chairs and tables making it awkward and difficult to maneuver. Also, it would be nice if the beer taps were behind the bar, not in front of it in our faces. The men's washroom is too small - 1 urinal and 1 stall. Come on!
