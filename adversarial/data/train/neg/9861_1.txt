Ah the famous Fountains!\n\nWe returned to Las Vegas for a gift show this time.  The first time was 2 years ago.  My boyfriend at the time took me here to see the fountain (or so I thought).... We found a secluded balcony overlooking the fountain- surrounded by lovely scented flowers.  The weather was just perfect, and the fountain was playing \"time to say goodbye\" by Andrea Bocelli, which is a beautiful love song.  It was perfect- and even more perfect after he suddenly pulled a ring out of his pocket and proposed. :) \n\nTwo years later, we are happily married and enjoying the same song from the fountain.  This is a must see if you are in Vegas!  It's romantic and so beautiful!  \n\nThe fountain plays a song every 1\/2 an hour from 3-8pm, and then every 15 minutes from 8-midnight.  There is usually a big crowd, so if you can go to the little walkway with the stone balconies, it isn't as crowded, and usually not at all during the
