While visiting Vegas, my pregnant self craved for filipino food. After a long search, we have found this restaurant and boy, this place cook real filipino food.  \nWe had their soup, pansit, chicken adobo and eggroll..\nThe employees definitely render good customer service and that's always a plus. \nAnother great thing about this place, they give you big amount of food for cheaper price. \"D
