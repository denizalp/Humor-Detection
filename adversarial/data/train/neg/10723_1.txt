Really cute place and smart use of a historic location. This use to be a post office and general store :)\n\nWhen you walk in, you already get the summer tea time feel with the bright white interior and case laid out with beautiful pastries. \n\nI like that they offer gluten free desserts so any one can really enjoy a treat here. They also have a rainbow colored cupcake where proceeds go to sick kids :) awesome!\n\nI had a orange blueberry donut. I'm not big on sweets so this was 100% way too sweet for me. But I loved the flavor! Orange really paired well with the sweet dessert and I had a nice bittersweet cappuccino to wash it down.\n\nIt's a cute environment and I think I'd be happy to stop by again and maybe try something a bit less sweet :)
