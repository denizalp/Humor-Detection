Got it the first time as take out and the burger was so juicy and cooked perfectly. The fries were also great, very thick fries and they give you a lot of fries! Went back the second time to have it in the restaurant. Very quick service even with a decent amount of people inside and tried their poutine this time too! The poutine was average, nothing great but nothing bad about it. Definitely one of the best burger places in Richmond Hill & can't wait for their expansion to their current place.
