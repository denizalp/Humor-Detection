Big mistake to go here!!  It is an assembly line. Techs running in and out of the room while you sit in the chair and wonder what in the world you've gotten yourself into.  When the guy who acts like a dentist actually sits next to you he does not introduce himself.  He did not spot a cavity that I know that I have since he did not use that probe instrument.  I had to ask him for his name and ask if he was a dentist.  Yep. No smiles from anyone in the office.  What a nightmare!!!
