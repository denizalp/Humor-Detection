My experience today compelled me to write a review. I've been coming here very regularly and have raved to others about their long-lasting shellac.  Cindy is the best and one of her shellacs lasted almost a month! (With some tlc on my part).  They are pricey, which was previously my only issue. But worth it.  Sadly today I had my first negative experience and even more sadly it was with the owner Tina.  I requested a pedi and shellac and Tina worked on the pedi and mani, then handed off to Cindy for the shellac.  I was actually glad she did.  I know Tina is very busy which make me feel as if I wasn't being attended to and rushed- very rough pedi.  The salon had a bad bottle of Polish - color too thin - which I has picked out obviously unknowingly. I guess Tina thought it was mine because she spoke in a brusque tone about it and made me pick something else .  Only afterwards did she learn that it was their polish, not mine.  Perhaps Tina needs more staff so that she can focus on managing rather than doing nails because she seems way too busy to do a top notch job, which is what I've had from the other technicians up to now.  You guys are too pricey for anything else less than the best service.  Based on today I could have gone somewhere else and paid half the price for this level of service. I know you can do better Tina's nails.
