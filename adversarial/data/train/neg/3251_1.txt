I've never been to O charleys before now and I probably wont ever go back. I wish I could say it was just the staff that was rude. But it was also the food. Steak was undercooked and so was chicken. Mashed potatoes were crusty? How's that even possible. And then to top it off we had trouble with the bill. The manager was friendly and apologized. Look elsewhere before settling on this resturant.
