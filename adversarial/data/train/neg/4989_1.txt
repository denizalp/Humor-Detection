If you love big meaty American sandwiches this is the place to be. I'm not a fan of beer at all but that doesn't stop me from enjoying Fat Heads! I have enjoyed almost everything I've tried here. Only thing that didn't catch my fancy was the wings- the sauces are good but the wings themselves are just okay.
