This Uncle Bob's facility is absolutely great! Douglas the manager has great customer service and can take care of whatever you need. The facility itself is well maintained and one of the cleanest storage facilities I've ever seen. I highly recommend anyone who wants a good experience with storing there items safely and affordably.
