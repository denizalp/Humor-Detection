Called and placed a order for my office today and the guy who answer was very rude. I mean customer service is just not his thing. Little does he know that I've been eating there since the old ow ers had the place . Moving fwd...i tried to place my order and he literally said he'll call me back and hung up . Never called back and I'm never going back. Shit service.
