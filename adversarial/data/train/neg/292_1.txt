Went there for lunch on a Thursday noon, wasn't really crowded here, but the service is still a bit slow. The menu is similar with the other Mon Ami restaurants in Montreal, the choices of dishes are quite varied and price fair enough. My biggest problem with this Mon Ami is the taste, it is really different from the mother branch at NDG, which is excellent. Even though the bibimbap of Mon Ami never wow me, but the one at Mon Ami Brossard is way worse than most bibimbap that I tried so far. Their cheese corn is good, as well as their spicy seafood soup, but not amazing. I would say that it is not my greatest Korean meal, but acceptable, would I go back? Unlikely.
