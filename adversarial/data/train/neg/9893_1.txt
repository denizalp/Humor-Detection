Great selection, even in clearance racks! Super friendly staff. Clean store & organized well. Found several shoes that I saw earlier at another store for at least 30% more. Reminded me to shop DSW before other shoe shopping. I ended up buying 3 pairs & got a birthday discount. My husband also found a pair of comfortable dress shoes as well as some snazzy dress sox. It's remarkable that this is one store that he doesn't mind going to - I'm feeling like I got a great deal today.
