Best Chinese in Pgh, hands down.  A tiny little family-owned place, Mekong is everything you could ask for in a Chinese restaurant.  Mom is the cook, daughters are the waitress, son-in-law hangs out to lend a hand.  I've even seen a grandpa around on the odd occasion.\n\nThe food is superlative.  Mekong has the best hot-n-sour soup I've ever tasted, and that's not just in the burgh, that's IN THE WORLD.  In addition to the composition, it's got an extra smokey flavor that's truly unique.  Everything else is to the same standard.  You really can't go wrong.  Nothing fru fru, but it's obvious that they use high-quality ingredients and cook it perfectly.\n\nWith such a small staff, they get to know you very quickly, which means you can ask them to tailor things to your taste and they will.  Their \"spicy\" is pretty hot to begin with, but they'll go as high as you want.  \n\nPricing is very reasonable.  Portions are huge; we always take some home.\n\nParking is often a nightmare in Dormont, but you can sometimes grab some on-street parking with a meter if you're lucky.
