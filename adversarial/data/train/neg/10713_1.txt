I visit Taco y Taco for lunch very often and sue to the large selection I change it up every time. If you love authentic Mexican street tacos, this is the place. I have a taste for what many qualify as the weird stuff on the menu but I encourage every one of you to be adventurous and try at least the tongue\/lengua or tripe\/trippas tacos. I highly recommend this Vegas gem! I am not a drinker but they do have an enormous full bar as well.
