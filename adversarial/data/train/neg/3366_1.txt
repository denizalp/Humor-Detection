Nasty place...won't go back!!! I ordered 6 Chicken Tacos and told the dumb lady in drive thru three times what I wanted. Her English was so bad that I couldn't understand what she was said back to me. The bottom of the foam container was saturated in oil, flimsy tacos heated in microwave were greasy and lettuce dried out. I found a small piece of thin hair floating in grease, I assume it came from one of the tacos. I feel like my tongue has a metallic substance that won't go away. I called to complain and spoke to the manager about the service and my order. She suggested I return with my receipt. Not going to happen since I live 3 miles away. She stated my order was not oily since they only heat their food. Little does she know, there was a burnt hole from heating where grease had seeped out! Stay clear from this location and go to Amado's!!!
