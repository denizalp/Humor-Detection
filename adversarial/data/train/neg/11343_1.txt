Do NOT bother calling this guy. Can't even return a phone call after 24 hours to set a time to come out, let alone provide service. I'm only leaving one star because I have to. I'd prefer not to leave any stars. We were assigned to him by our home warranty company. After 20 hours of no return call, the home warranty company gave us the \"emergency number\". Same answering message and no return call. If your home warranty company assigns you to this guy, ask for someone else!
