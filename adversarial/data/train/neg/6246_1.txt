The Buffet at Bellagio is one of the best buffet in LV. They have sooo much food to choose from and each of them are delicately prepared. Their kobe beef, though i doubt if its the real one, is really good. King crabs are cut in have so its easier to work with. Sashimi are fresh. And their dessert, there is sooo much to choose from and taste really good. I would definitely come back here if i have the money.
