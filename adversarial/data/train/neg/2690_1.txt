Both of these are kind of true:\n\"This place is to Ross what Ross is to a department store clothing shop...\" AND \"  \nThis is like....a Kmart and Goodwill crashed and made a baby. No, the stuff isn't donated,  \"  \n but you get what you pay for OR more... I found a bunch of out of season sweat shirts for a $1 each for kids  ...I bought a bunch of them so they can be given to kids at my school for use next winter...they are fluorescent yellow for maybe riding bikes to  school.
