\"Really good food. The fillet was done to perfection, as was the live Maine lobster. The sides were plentiful, but too much so, although I was a bit disappointed by the steamed vegetables... way too much of one vegetable for my taste (zucchini)... The escargot was delicious, and seasoned perfectly. The cake for dessert [so I'm told, i don't indulge in that vice, but the person telling me is someone who knows their cakes...] was incredible. Ordered it to taste and then take the rest home, but the only way her plate would have been emptier when she was done if she had licked it clean...\"
