This hidden place up by musselman lake has a great view while you enjoy your dinner. The service was great but you do have to wait a bit for a table since it is quite busy in the summer time. Food is a little bit pricey for the amount you get unfortunately. Our bill came up to $200 for 4 people with 3 drinks and we weren't really full. The food was great don't get me wrong but they didn't give us a lot. The Ahi Tuna Poke is really good if you are going!
