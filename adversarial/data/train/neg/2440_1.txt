Update: Response to Dealer Response.\nThough I appreciate you trying to clean this all up after the fact, I didn't respond to you privately because I felt it was unnecessary.\n\nFirst of all, despite all of our issues and concerns throughout the Buying Process with your Dealership, we never heard from you, nor had we ever even heard your name until this Review was posted.  Where were you while you're Team was feeding us a bunch of false information?  It would have been nice to hear from you when I was upset that we were sold on a Boat you didn't own, and the Demo process that wasn't possible because the Boat was in AZ!\n\nSecondly, your Finance Team is the one that suggested that one of us drop off of the App for the chance of a better rate and less money down.  We did so, per the advice of your Finance Team.  And yes, we did take our Loan somewhere else, per the advice of the Lender that you worked \"so diligently\" to obtain.  America First Credit Union advised me to take my deal somewhere else, because I was going to be spending $34.k on $17.k Vessel.  And for the record- they were able to put myself and my co-signer on the Loan after I went down to the Bank myself and took things into my own hands.\n\nWith regard to your \"Skin in the Game\" comment- is that a Financial Term?  I find it strange that you call it one thing, and the Lender you worked \"so diligently\" to find for us calls it something else.  For the sake of understanding, I'll use your terminology....\n\"Skin in the Game\", for the Bank, would be loaning me money to buy a boat, that's actually worth the amount they're loaning out- or in my current case, loaning me money for a vessel that's worth more than what they loaned out.  It was the Lender that advised that the reason they needed so much money down, was because they didn't value the vessel at what you did, and we had to close the gap with more cash.\n\nAgain- I appreciate your effort in trying to clean this up, but please don't waste your time trying to manipulate, twist and contort the situation on my Post.\n\n***********************************************************\n\nSuch High Hopes when I contacted Boulder Boats...\n\nShould've been easy- ended up being a long and drawn out process (despite a 760+ Credit Score and 10% Cash Down) and we inevitably ended up buying down the Street.\n\nInitially called about a Boat seen on Boat Trader- come to find out that almost everything they have on there has been Sold for months and they \"leave the ADs up to draw people in\".\n\nEnded up finding a Boat that would work for us that they had in AZ (we are in Vegas).  I was impressed with their Demo Process, their knowledge of everything Marine, and the ease of applying for Financing, however...  after waiting over a week to get everything done, we were told that the Boat was on consignment, and we would have to either fly out to AZ to demo the Boat, or Sign all of the Docs without ever seeing the Boat in person because it \"can't leave the State until it's paid for in full on a Consignment Deal.\n\nThe fact that they don't Own the Boat, and are just selling it for someone else, should've have been disclosed at the very beginning of any conversation about buying it, and\/or Selling me on the Demo Process.\n\nAfter expanding our search, and Buying an amazing Boat down the Street (which only took 3 Days to get home), we realized that every Boat we were looking at with Boulder Boats was priced way over the NADA Value, which is why we couldn't get a decent deal while financing.  Every Boat we inquired about, came back at 80-85% to Loan ratio, which meant the Bank valued each Vessel at 15-20% less than the Dealer was selling them for.\n\nI can say this- Brittany in Finance was Stellar.  So good, that we took the Loan she was able to get for us, and brought it to another Dealership, for a different Boat.  She was so helpful, that we wanted to stay with her despite the issues we were having with their Sales Team, but just couldn't find the right deal with them.\n\nHaving dealt with Boulder Boats, and a Competitor down the street within the same 2 weeks- my Family and I feel we've experienced both ends of the Spectrum.  I hate to say it, because it's \"BOULDER BOOATS\"...  but the experience we had with them was frustrating, and nothing more than a waste of time.
