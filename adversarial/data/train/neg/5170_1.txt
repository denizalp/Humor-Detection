Very friendly environment with pretty good coffee and baked goods.\n\nCoffee is more a loose term here as most coffee items can only be had latte or Americano style so the coffee can be more watery. It's a different take on the coffee shop in that way so don't let that sway your decisions to cop out and go to Starbucks \n\nThe green coffee is the same way and is more of a mix between a coconut or nutty milk drink and does not taste like coffee. It's refreshing and doesn't have those weird aftertastes like the magical milk that comes from nuts.
