Awesome spot for breakfast lunch and everything in between! My family and I normally eat at the downtown eateries but came across this gem on Yelp and had to try! \nOf course we couldn't pass up a chocolate malt to start. I enjoyed an omelet while my dad ordered a classic cheeseburger. You can't go wrong with either their extensive breakfast or lunch choices!
