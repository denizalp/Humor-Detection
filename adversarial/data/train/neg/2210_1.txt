Our daughter has been taking speech therapy sessions for over 2 years, originally she was taking them at Clubhouse Innovative therapy centers for the first year and a half. We later found T.E.A.M. 4 Kids online and after speaking to them on the phone, we decided  to switch her, mainly because of convenience , since we live in the west side of town and they offered a similar program as the one in Clubhouse.\n\nHer therapist Chelsea was great and we could see our daughter making progress. \n\nUnfortunately, ever since she left they have been under staffed and haven't been able to get regular appointments. What was really upsetting was that one of their managers reached out to us and told us our daughter had graduated their program and she had no more need to attend, when clearly that is remotely from the truth since she hasn't reached the goals set by her therapist. Ignoring completely the issue that they are understaffed and no longer available to accommodate our daughter, which I thought it was very unprofessional.  Their administration and front office is ran poorly. Which leads me to think them having a hard time maintaining good therapists. \n\nI would strongly recommend looking into  Clubhouse Innovative Therapy Centers not only their therapists are excellent, their front office and administration staff are outstanding very involved friendly and caring for the kids, although it is 1+ hour drive for us since they are located close to Shea Blvd and Tatum is well worth the drive, hopefully they can open a center on this side of town.
