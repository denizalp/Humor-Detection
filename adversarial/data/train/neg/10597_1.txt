Inept, bait and switch, excuses, lies and misrepresentations. If that's what you want, call this place. They quoted me $50 to reinstall a ceiling fan which had the mounting bracket and wiring installed. The handyman showed up and had clearly never dealt with a ceiling fan. When he found it he had to install it, he said that was much more. He called the office and they told him it would be $95. I explained to him that I had told Maria there (apparently new) that the fan was disassembled and that's what I needed done. I'd explained it to her twice prior to her quoting me  $50. He came back, connected six wires (and incorrectly, no less, as the fan light still doesn't work), and since he wanted the full $95 for the installation, I said I'd finish, and gave him a check for $50. When they called that afternoon to see if I was satisfied and I made it clear I wasn't, I spoke to Cindy who explained that both Maria and Tony, the inept installer, were new. She said that she would send me a check for $25 to make up for the inconvenience. After not receiving the check, I called and she gave me the run around about how her service manager and all involved thought that $50 was fair. $50 to connect some wires? The guy worked for literally 10 minutes. I asked her if she would pay that and after much hesitation she stated that she thought it was fair. I'm reporting them to the BBB and telling everyone I know to avoid this place and to tell everyone they know the same! What ripoff artists. And from reading others' reviews, apparently they do this often.
