We visited a few years ago and were unimpressed.  We decided to give it a try again this year and were again disappointed.  Everything from a rude hostess to bad service topped with food that was mediocre at best.  The fried zucchini was doused with oil, the bruscetta was soggy, the sides were overpowered with what tasted like pre-jarred garlic. We were a group of 12 and not one of us was satisfied. Once the dinner was over, we waited at least 20 minutes for dessert to arrive with all incorrect coffee orders.  Certainly not what we expected on Christmas Eve.
