Happened to be driving by this place as it is close to our house. Stopped in for breakfast and was blown away! The customer service was very attentive, but the food is incredible. I had a half size breakfast plate and there was plenty! It was a fairly normal order eggs, sausage, hashbrowns, and toast but it was prepared exactly how I like it. My boyfriend had the special, breakfast chimis w rice and beans the first time and ouevos ranchero the next and he LOVED both! Huge portions, he didn't finish it and the flavor was amazing. They make their own salsa too and it's delicious. Atmosphere is a small family diner type, definitely comfortable and they take pride in their establishment. I recommend this restaurant for breakfast over any other in Scottsdale purely for the outstanding quality to price ratio.
