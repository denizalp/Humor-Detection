So I used to go to Discount tires, but they are closed Sunday so I came to this Big O Tires.  \n\nThe staff was super friendly,  I have been in twice and both times I was helped quickly and by very friendly guys.  Not sure why everyone is so cranky.  \n\nI got two new tires for my '98 ford ranger.  They were done in 20 minutes.  Great experience, not sure why ratings are so low.
