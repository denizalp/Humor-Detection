Essential the same scene over and over again with an ABBA song thrown in there for good measure. Was a frustrating show to watch as the characters fear of confrontation was evident in every scene. I'm wondering how this is a \"smash hit\"?\n\nIf you HAVE to check it out go to Goldstar.com.. you can get discount tickets there.
