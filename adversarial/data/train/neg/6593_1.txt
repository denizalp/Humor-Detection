I was a customer of Kids R Our Future for almost 2 years before I decided there are plenty of much better care facilities for my children, although most of them cost more.  But you get what you pay for.  Kids R Our Future might offer low cost, but when it comes to your children's education and care, do you really want the cheapest place?\nThe owner's integrity was the last straw for me in addition to the quality concerns.  I tolerated the quality issues for some time because honestly we don't have a lot of extra money.  But recently we decided to move to a facility that costs more as we cannot overlook the problems anymore.  \nWe signed up to Kids R Our Future in December 2014 under a special promotion.  I have attached a copy of the promotional flyer so you can read and make your own judgment and I blocked the prices due to undeserved respect for the company.  The first line said \"Special Promo.  Permanent 10% off\".  The second line then said \"Additional 10% off for Families of two or more.\"  In December I signed our 2 children up.  So we received the supposedly permanent 10% off for each child AND the additional 10% off.  Then my older son started school this year and so I withdrew him, while keeping my youngest in there.  I expected us to still receive the \"permanent 10%\" off for my youngest.  However, I noticed there was no more discounts.  I was charged full price.  So I inquired with the owner and even showed him the flyer and asked why I no longer received 10% off.  The owner provided multiple different reasons why the special no longer applies:\n* That was a really old special\nUmm...not sure why it matters that it was an old special.  Does the word \"permanent\" mean something else to him?\n* The discount only applies to siblings\nThis also made no sense to me as the second line of the special clarified it to me that for sibling or \"families of two or more\" there was an \"additional\" thus separate 10% discount than the \"permanent 10% off\".  \n* The discount was void because I withdrew my son\nThis was the same as the second bullet above in terms of not making sense.  I was only talking about the discount associated with my youngest, who was never withdrawn.  I was not expecting to receive the additional 10% off, but the permanent should still apply to my youngest as it was supposed to be \"permanent\".  \nBottom line, they refused to honor the terms we signed up to.  This led me to question their integrity in addition to quality of care.  This is not about money as I mentioned earlier we decided to pay more for a different facility.  The teacher to children ratio was high.  Multiple times my son was left for significant amount of time with soiled clothes that it was extremely difficult to clean because the soil was caked in.  Children while potty training can have accidents, but to leave them without changing them was awful and disgusting.  One time I picked up my son and he was outside and the teacher did not even know he had pooped in his pants.  It was caked in, so I knew it had been there for some time.  There were multiple other incidences that really made me questioned their quality of care like my daughter telling me the teachers used \"bad words\", or me walking in while the teacher yelled at the kids inappropriately.  \nIn the end, if low cost is what you are looking for, then this was one of the lowest cost facility.  But if quality and integrity are more important to you, then look elsewhere.  When it comes to your children's care and education, do you want cheap or do you want quality?
