Just brought a 2007 X5 in for an oil change. Had set up an appointment, was on time and told I was next for service. The car was bought here, along with a ValueCare package from them that included oil changes. \n\nAfter 20 minutes of waiting I was called into the service tech area. I thought the car was done. The tech asked me to sit down and I asked where was the car. He said I had to provide a signature and how I was going to pay. I told him I didn't care for their approach in an attempted upsell and all I wanted was on oil change. The Tech said this was the way BMW did things. I repeated what I had told the tech when I made the appointment: it was included in the ValueCare package they sold me. He told me they don't keep copies of the contracts they sell. Fortunately, I had the contract with me. He grudgingly agreed there was no charge and they would start. \n\nBeen here for over an hour and still a simple oil change isn't done. What the hell?  Wouldn't bring the car back here if the oil change wasn't included in the contract they sold. Wouldn't buy a car, a contract, or service here, again. Thumbs down in this dealership.
