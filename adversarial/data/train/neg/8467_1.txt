This place needs a complete overhaul. I felt like I was back in the year 1990!!!! First of all it is 100% geared towards children which isn't bad but if you're looking for a fun quirky adult date at a \"science center\", not the place to go!! It's outdated and a lot the activities are missing pieces and parts, many of the activities look like they need to be cleaned. I took my kids and they were even a little disappointed. We bought tickets to the planetarium show, it was blurry and the images were bad quality. The planetarium itself was very nice but the show itself not so much. Wouldn't return, unless they renovated did a complete remodel brought things up to date.
