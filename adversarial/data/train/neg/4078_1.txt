I sat down for Superbowl Sunday ready to order. After 10min of waiters and bartenders looking at me like I was an incomplete party, I was finally approached and ordered a cheeseburger and fries. Cheeseburger arrived as ordered. I wasn't impressed. Easily one step down from Fuddruckers and Five Guys. Fries were worse. Extremely greasy breaded steak fries, seems like they marinated in grease before cooking them. 2 stars off for postponed greeting and bad fries.
