I frequent Olive & Ivy quite often -- almost once a weekend, in fact, since I love their brunch menu.  The food is definitely not the best, or the most exotic that can be available, but I find it very good nonetheless.  \n\nThe normal routine I find most in tune with my taste is to walk in mid-morning and put my name in (I always end up waiting, though it's normally only 5 minutes, so its completely negligible), which gives me just enough time to grab a mimosa for my brunch mate and I.  The mimosa's are somewhat of a hit-and-miss, meaning the ratio of ingredients ranges depending on which bartender does the job.  Really though, they never are bad, and much better than countless other establishments I've patronized.\n\nThe food is very good in my opinion, and the pastry basket is a nice addition to any brunch, though it's definitely not for those on any sort of diet!  I usually order the mushroom omelet, which works great for any sort of low carb diet, and I am always happy with it.\n\nThe atmosphere is pretty good for weekend mornings, though I haven't yet tried a dinner here yet.  I've heard fairly good things from everyone I know that has gone, though.  The outdoor patio is somewhat of a rarity in the Valley of the Sun, which is a shame since the 8 or so months out of the year when the weather is enjoyable (they have portable heaters during the winter), the spacious patio is very nice.  There are expansive sofas surrounding a fountain, and arranged tables throughout the outdoor area.\n\nThe wait staff has been generally good, though sometimes they have forgotten to bring us water, which is honestly no problem.  If you remind them, they almost come running back with it.\n\nOverall, I continue to come when I'm available, and definitely recommend it to anyone going into the area.
