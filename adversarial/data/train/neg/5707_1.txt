Got the guacamole and it was good but not for $9. It was about a little over a cup. The nachos had a good amount of steak but the nachos on the bottom were mushy. The nachos on top were good.  My husband got the burger and said it was very good cooked perfect. My daughter got the veggie quesadillas and that was good. Server was attentive and friendly.
