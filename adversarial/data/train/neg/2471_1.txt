Recently I was very disappointed. I looked at the menu online and saw they had over the top fries but when I got to the food truck they didn't have it so I was a little sad but lived with it and ordered the garlic Parmesan fries. The people were so nice though so it made up for it. Sadly though I waited 30 minutes for my fries. Now this was at a community center so it wasn't too busy. To my disappointment it was a very small size with no garlic. It was literally garlic powder. Although I can not say how the rest of the food was I recommend to not get the fries.
