This started out to be a good experience. Was told my tire repair would be free in exchange for a great yelp review. Was called right away and told I needed a replacement instead of repair. Gave the ok to do the replacement. Did not hear from them again. Went into the store 2 1\/2 hours later to check on my car to see it just sitting in the front, and to find out it had been done. No call letting me know of the status. Paid my 150.23 for a tire. Got in it car and my tire pressure light was still on, not only for the tire they just replaced but all four tires. When I went in to tell them they told me repeatedly you have to drive it for it to turn off. Yes this is true with some vehicles. Not with mine. I ended up going to a Chevron paying a 1.50 for air to fill up my tires and guess what all my tire pressure lights went off. Will never use them again!
