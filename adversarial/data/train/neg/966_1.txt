I love this shop! It is the most professional and cleanest shop I've ever been in. All the artists are super friendly and welcoming when you come in. My artist Taija is amazing. I came in to have a previous tattoo covered and 3 other artists from other shops said they wouldn't touch it, she covered it no problem and it looks so beautiful. My husband even got an amazing eagle by Duane. Both are amazing artist and this is definitely the shop to go to if you want beautiful quality work!
