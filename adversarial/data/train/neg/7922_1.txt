Had the Wolfgang Puck truffled potato chips w blue cheese crumbles DELICIOUS ! My steak skewers were cooked perfectly and the steak sauce had sweet taste to it. Service was good - not great ... just expected a little more from this place considering the name. The food deserves 5 stars but overall 4 stars.
