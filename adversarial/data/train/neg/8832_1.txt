Lana is working on my daughters wedding dress as we speak ;)  She was referred by a satisfied bride!  It doesn't get better than that!\n\nThe perfect dress came 2 sizes too big and is made of french lace and jewels.  It's taking a lot of work by Lana is a true angel putting it all together.  \n\nShe also came up with the perfect veil which we hadn't planned to use one but like I said she's an angel and immediately knew the perfect veil. \n\nWe were so happy to find her as the boutique recommended seamstress did not have a website, did not return phone calls, and demanded all fees up front.  Didn't sit well or give us a good feeling.\n\nNow on to find a Mother of the Bridge dress and get it in for alterations...
