I've visited many salons in my neighborhood looking for someone to do an adequate pedicure and have been disappointed until I brought my 96 year old mother for a mani\/pedi to ANGEL at Allure. She was so sweet and gentle and did such a nice job, I returned 3 days later for a pedicure for myself with her.  \nThe shop is clean, the other technicians were nice and friendly and their prices are fair.\nI will be returning!!
