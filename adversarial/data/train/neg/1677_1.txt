I agree with others that this place is average or subpar in terms of service and food. It satisfies that craving but there is definitely better ramen out there. I've been here about 5 times. The broth here is rather flavourless generally and the noodles do have that \"soapy\" or strong alkaline flavour I find. But nothing is offensively bad. \n\nI mean, if the service was excellent it would make things better, but it's not!
