My husband and I have lived in Chandler 18 years now & this is my third time to the Arizona Science Museum. I brought my brother and nephew from Iowa here today. When I worked at the Motorola Computer Group in Tempe from 1998 - 2002 as an admin in engineering, supporting a Vice President, Chau Pham, he was selected to be on the Board of Directors here. This is a fascinating museum for the young and old. If you have an opportunity, please take advantage of this educational, fun, learning experience! I easily give this museum \"5\" stars!!!
