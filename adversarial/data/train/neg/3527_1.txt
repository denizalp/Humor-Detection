I came here for lunch today because they give free birthday meals and I was very impressed. I'll probably come back before my next birthday and actually pay for my meal! \nFor the free birthday meal, you have to tell them as you're getting seated so they can check your ID. You can only get it on the day of your birthday and you can come with any party size! I regret coming for lunch because there's a larger selection at dinner time. \nThe service was great. The employees were quick at taking away my plates while I was away from my table. All the employees were very friendly as well. I saw a customer forget her jacket as she was leaving the restaurant and an employee ran after her to give it to her. I really appreciate that kind of service! \nNow let's talk about the food: \nSushi: only had sushi rolls for lunch but good selection and quality, way better than Mandarin sushi! I'm a big fan.\nCustom Woks: I was so impressed with this station. They had chicken, beef, shrimp, fish, imitation crab, udon noodles, egg noodles, and a wide variety of veggies! You put whatever you want onto a plate and give it to the worker at the wok station and he boils then stir frys it for you in the sauce of your choice. It's so quick and delicious.\nTeppanyaki: the basa and tilapia were good, cooked perfectly and seasoned well. Very garlic-y. The beef was ok. I don't recommend it. \nDim Sum: the sui mai was ok but the har gows was good! \nChicken Wings: one of my favourites, really crispy. \nDesserts: they have a wide variety of pudding, fruit, ice cream, and pastries. I liked the caramel pudding and ice cream the best. Their soft serve ice cream was so good, comes in vanilla, chocolate, and twist. You get to do it yourself too.\nCome here for dinner on your birthday and have a free delicious meal! You won't regret it :)
