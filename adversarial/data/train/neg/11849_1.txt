This review is for the Salon part of Green Valley Ranch.  The spa & salon is located next door to each other.\n\nMy mom wanted us to get pedicures together.  I called 3 salons (the day after Thanksgiving) and everyone was booked.  I found the salon online and it was rated as The Best of Las Vegas 2010.  I called and we were able to get in at 2pm.\n\nThis was my first time at GVR.  I parked in the parking garage and trekked through the hotel and found ourselves outside at the pool area, following the signs to the Spa & Salon.  After getting lost, we saw this all glass building that overlooks the pool- that was the spa & salon.  Even after working up a sweat trying to find this place, we still arrived about 10 minutes early. (-1 star for lack of directions to this place!)  We got to pick out our nail color and then took us back.\n\nThe chairs were really comfortable.  Leather, massaging chairs that felt great.  We got the Traditional Pedicure, with the 20% off local's discount, the pedicures were $64 each.  Definitely worth every penny!  They massage, scrub, trim, file, put all kinds of great lotions, etc. on your feet.  The pedicure is about 50 minutes and you are totally relaxed after it.\n\nWe then had to walk allllll the way back through the hotel to the parking garage.  I wish I would have read some reviews on here, to see they have a private lot.\n\nI will definitely back.  Hopefully next time for a massage!
