This was waay beyond my expectations!  I was thinking Elton John would be over-the-top fabulous, but I didn't expect this production.  Vegas, EJ and David Lachappelle all in the same show and you have madness!  \n\nThe Rocket Man video w\/ Justin Timberlake (who you can't hardly recognize!) was amazing.  And Pam Anderson during 'Bitch' perfection.  I wish I had swung a bit more to get seats up in the first 2 rows since they got to go up on stage around the red piano to dance to Saturday Night's Alright.  Ending with Your Song I thought was a bit of a downer although my favorite song.  But you want to end on a high note right?  All in all this was totally worth the money and really showed me what Vegas shows are all about.  And not only that, but it was just a dream come true to see him on stage live.  Never would I have though I'd get to see that.  Thanks Mom for forcing me to listen to your old EJ records when I was younger!  What I blast I'm having now!
