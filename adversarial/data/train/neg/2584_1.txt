I'm surprised at the number of negative reviews!  I enjoy this Denny's location!  It a a good for a quick cheap meal.  When I've been there, the staff (Today Eli waited on me--he was great!) has always been friendly and helpful.  The food is good too. . .it's Denny's. . .not Mastro's.  Today, I ordered off of the \"Build Your Own Burger\" menu and my veggi burger was yummy.  In the past, I have ordered breakfast at this location and it has been good too!  I will say that the location is dated (the only reason I gave this location a 4\/5 and not a 5\/5).  The decor is old, the carpets are old and stained.  The place is in desperate need of a face lift. . .especially in such a high end location.  The service and food is good though!
