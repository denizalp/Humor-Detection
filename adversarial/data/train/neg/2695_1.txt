I love the Organicare Cleaners at Desert Ridge. Here's what I love: it has a drive-thru, it is open until 8pm on weekdays, it is open on Saturdays, the owner is really friendly, the finished product looks great, free delivery, AND NO chemicals! I feel good about getting my family's clothes cleaned here. Plus, this is a locally owned business and it's great to support our local businesses. The price is reasonable and I really like the reusable bags. They will even keep your credit card on file which I think is really convenient. I used to go to Desert Ridge cleaners which was more expensive, closed at 6 (seriously not convenient for those of us who work!), and did not have a drive-thru. I will never go back to my old cleaner, I am an Organicare lifer!
