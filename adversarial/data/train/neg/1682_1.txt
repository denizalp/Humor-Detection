I brought my van to Scottsdale Muffler & Automotive at the recommendation of my very knowledgeable mechanic; he knows who is good  and who isn't!\n\nI talked to Chris on the phone and told him my mechanic was recommending a catalytic converter for my van to help me pass the state emissions inspection. He asked me a couple of questions and let me know that they could have my van done in about 45 minutes and quoted me a price, which was less than half of any other shops I contacted!\n\nHowever, I like to do as much of my own vehicle maintenance as I can, so I looked into what it would take to replace my own catalytic converter. Turns out, I would actually have to spend about $100 MORE to do the work myself!!!\n\nI quickly called and set up an appointment!\n\nWhile waiting in the lobby, the mechanic working on my van came in and said he needed to show me something (oh no, here we go!).\n\nHe showed me that my muffler had a pretty large crack in it. He offered to replace the muffler with a new one for $115, which I thought was a very fair price for my vehicle. I asked if the crack was causing any performance problems and he said no. I then asked if the crack could be welded and if the muffler would work ok with this fix. He said yes, and offered to do this repair for only $30! \n\nHere's the really cool thing: he could have easily told me that my performance would suffer if I didn't buy a new muffler. And I would have believed him. I know quite a bit about cars, but not everything. I was ready to go ahead with the new muffler if he said I needed it. But he was HONEST and let me know that a simple and inexpensive weld would take care of things.\n\nAs a small business owner myself, I really appreciate it when other businesses treat me well. I am happy to say that the folks over at Scottsdale Muffler & Automotive will have all of my future business!
