My husband and I love to do work from Urban Beans.  We enjoy the coffee, the snacks they offer are always delicious, and the space is great.\n\nMy only complaint is the service, and it's only one barista in particular.  We get great service from everyone else.  Much like one of the reviewers below, we have had this barista just stare at us when come up to the counter with a strange look on her face, and she says nothing.  I decided to just start ordering when the strange look turned into a nasty looking smirk.  I've asked her about some of the food on previous visits, if she had eaten it, and she made another strange face and said, \"Uh, no.\"  This barista really creates a terrible vibe for our visits, and seems very unfriendly and rude.  \n\nWe LOVE the place, for every other reason, but next work-session, we are going to try somewhere else.  I'm sure we will be back in though - UB is just too good in all other areas.
