I think my favorite story about Beef 'n Bottle is a few years back when P Diddy tried to rent out the whole restaurant. The owners wouldn't have it because they don't rent out the entire place as it would be an inconvenience to the regulars who sit at the same booths with the same servers every week. \n\nThis place is Old Charlotte at its best. \n\nThe steaks are massive and perfectly cooked. Beef 'N Bottle's six-ounce filet mignon ($34) is the most popular steak on the menu. I get the 10-ounce filet ($43) because that's how I roll. It comes with a classic iceberg lettuce salad and a side (I do a baked potato).\n\nThe last time I was here, I had half a dozen oysters which were the biggest oysters I have ever seen. The (spicy!) cocktail sauce is house made and I'd like to buy a bottle for my house. \n\nOne note: Beef 'n Bottle is an old school steakhouse that in many ways is right out of the 60s. If you're expecting a Del Frisco's experience, you'll be disappointed--but you'd also be missing the point of coming here.
