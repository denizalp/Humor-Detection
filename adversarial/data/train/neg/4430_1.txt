Champions Cuisine is a newly opened shop near T&T with an odd combination of Chinese comfort foods. They have congee, soup dumplings, regular dumplings, noodle soup, and an array of salty\/spicy side dishes that pair nicely with the plain congee they serve. \n\nWhat I really love about this place is variety for a good price. You get practically a chinese \"3 course meal\" (aka peanuts, congee, tea, and entree) for under $10. Portion sizes are reasonable enough for these combination meals to be split between two as well (if you're one of THOSE people of course).\n\nThe decor is nice, the place is spacious, but the individual meals themselves? Not comparable to a local chinese store that specializes in them. Don't come here if you just want to fulfil that xiaolongbao or beef noodle craving. Don't come here especially if you want some good congee. Come here if you are in a rush, low in cash, and down to try random dishes together.
