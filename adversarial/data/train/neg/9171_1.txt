Great place to workout!!! I was in town for a soccer tournament and I chose this gym because it was a true CrossFit Affiliate gym. I was not disappointed. Great programming, included a good warm-up and conditioning WOD. Coach Rob was gracious enough to let me do 18.5 with no problem. Coaching was spot on, focused on technique and strategy, treated me like a regular. Regulars were very friendly and helpful, made me feel at home!  Facility was clean and well organized with all necessary equiptment. I would wholeheartedly recommend this to anyone looking to drop in or for a gym to call home.
