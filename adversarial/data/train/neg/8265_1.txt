I was fine with the treatment I received initially.  When I read the claim on my insurance company's website I was shocked to see I had been billed $38 by Dr Shaba for cessation of tobacco counseling.  I haven't smoked since 1992.  I talked to his office and they said that he had told me \"Not to start smoking again\" during my office visit.  Really???  $38?  Makes me wonder whether the additional tests he wanted to do on me were indeed necessary?  In my opinion they practice deceptive billing at best and some would call them thieves.
