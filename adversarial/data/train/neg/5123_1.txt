I've only had one dish there, the #3 breakfast which had a yummy mixture of potatos, peppers, egg and toast. It was great and a large portion. The toast was especially great. I ended up bringing the rest home for dinner too. The waitress I had last time was a probably new to waitressing because she kept forgetting things, but the food more than made up for it. Going there again this weekend, maybe Ill try something new! The place is cute and very comfortable. You really can sit outside with all the umbrellas and shaded spaces.
