Wanted to get out of Caesars for a bit. After walking a short distance in the awesome summer heat Vegas has to offer, we decided to go into the first place we saw to eat. \n\nSo glad we did! Don't let the \"snacks\" part of the name degrade what they serve here. We got the Salmon sandwiches with a side order of fries. Totally fairly priced (for strip standards) and best salmon sandwich I've ever had... EVER. Fries were also perfect but cole slaw was a little peppery for my taste. \n\nIf you're nearby, I would suggest stopping here; you won't regret it!
