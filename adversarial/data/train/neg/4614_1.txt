Not reliable. When I've needed it most, internet service has either not been working (like when I was working from home) or been intolerably slow (like when I was trying to watch my alma mater win their first football conference championship in over 10 years). Their customer service tries to be responsive but their overall speed and reliability is just terrible for the exorbitant price.
