Very strange Harvey's\/ Swiss Chalet.  You can't see or find any sign of the Harvey's in the parking lot or front entrance of the Swiss Chalet.  Only from Taunton Road.  \n\nService was good, burgers are just okay.   Not a big fan of Harvey's anyways.  This was a stop of convenience.  Burger patties always taste like there is a lot of filler in them.  Non meat like texture to it.  Fries okay.  \n\nProbably won't have another Harvey's for another year.
