Pure love. I got my partner the chocolate cake and it tasted exactly like biting into a Ferraro Rocher! We all enjoyed it very much and best part was it wasn't too sweet. We usually get our favourites here: cannoli, gelato, rice balls\/arrachini, pasta of the day and whatever they have that looks good on the hot table. Really like the staff even the ones who greets customers by saying, \"Hi how are you? I'm new here so I don't know how to make anything.\" A + for honesty and I would probably say the same if I were their age. We genuinely love coming here!
