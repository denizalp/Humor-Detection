Read the reviews. Basing on what we have read, we popped by and gave it a go.\n\nThe food was decent. We were fond of the Salmon dish, and Shrimp cocktail. The salad bar was ok. The veggies, especially the leafy greens, looked a bit wilted at the time we dined (round 1130am). Sushi area could use a bit more authentication *hahaha* California Roll ... is that really sushi? ^_~\n\nJust like Jon G. stated... \"$10 all you can drink after buying the buffet.\" However, there is a time limit on how long you can enjoy your cold one.\n\nOverall, this spot was just \"OK.\" We did not appreciate the 1 hour and 35 minutes wait in line. But hey, once we were seated ... we took our sweet time savouring each dish!
