My boyfriend and I visited Tom's Urban while we were in Vegas for New Year's. We had one of the best restaurant experiences either of us can ever remember. Our server, Blue, was on the money with everything, from drinks to menu suggestions (and boy, was he SPOT ON with his recommendations). At one point when the boyfriend spilled his beer all over the table, Blue was on top of helping clean up the mess, as well as replacing our silverware and getting us a new beer. He made sure we were taken care of for our entire meal. We were so happy, we asked to talk to the manager to give him and his employees kudos for helping making our New Year's epic and memorable.\n\nThe food was also AMAZING. We ordered a few appetizers and it was a great amount of food to fill us up. I suggest the brussel sprouts. Blue did and they are to die for.\n\nThat being said, I will be sad if I don't see a Tom's Urban opening in Salt Lake City in the next year.
