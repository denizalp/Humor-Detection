This is my favorite movie theater above all, even better than the Tempe Marketplace Harkins. This theater is great because it's got 20 sceens, slightly more than normal which allows it to carry really good fringe movies that you wouldn't find at most any large movie theater. Their showtimes are awesome, always a ton of showings all day for big movies without that hour gap you get at most other theaters and late showings too! They often have many showings after 11pm on week nights which seems really good to me for being way out here on the edge of Chandler. Always lots of concessions open, I've never waited over 60 seconds at this theater, that's incredible 5 star service in this day and age. The building itself is located at the south end of the mall right next to the Valley Metro transit center. I can ride 72-Rural or 81-McClintock down to a movie real quick and it's a nice, short  walk to the front door. To top everything off its right on the mall with lots of food choices. It's my go to date theater with the restaurants out front or stop by the mall food court before a casual movie trip. All 20 theaters are large and spacious, seats are very comfortable, even for a long movie. Love the butter flavor pump they have out at the lobby too!
