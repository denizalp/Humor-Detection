I read about this place in a guide for Arizona and really wanted to check it since it is an authentic mexican restaurant. On our way to the airport from the Grand Canyon we briefly stopped here to pick up lunch. Since we didnt have time we ordered two take away burittos which we ate in the plane. This food even 3 hours later was DELICIOUS. i really want to go back to Phoenix just for this. The service was excellent too. Highly recommended restaurant.
