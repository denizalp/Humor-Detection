Looking at a number of the other reviews I would say our experience was in line with many of them. I'll start with the overall environment, which feels very open and clean for a fast casual place. Cleanliness also seemed very positive.\n\nFor the service, we were pretty pleased. Ordering was quick and easy, the 'remotes' that signal when the order is ready worked great. Then during the meal staff was very attentive to clear away trash from our table and ask if our needs were being met.\n\nAs many others have posted I think it's the food and value we were most disappointed with. We've enjoyed Blue Ribbon before, as they run the kitchen at Brooklyn Bowl, which we really like. Unfortunately we ordered the tenders which are not prepared in the same way as the wings and fried chicken, they just didn't have much going for them other than being piping hot! Looking around the room we immediately wished we had gone for the wings or actual fried chicken, it looked pretty good. We tried two sides, fries and corn. The fries were perfectly acceptable and a small fed two adults plus a toddler. The corn was a little watery and too reminiscent of something right from the can...with a little seasoning added. \n\nFinally on the value front, I'd agree with many reviewers in that I was a little surprised by the overall price point for what you get. It's not way out of whack, but running a little high.\n\nWe'll probably try again and definitely skip the tenders, it is great to have another option in the neighborhood.\n\nPS - Big fan of the habanero hot sauce!
