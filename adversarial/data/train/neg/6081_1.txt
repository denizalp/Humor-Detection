What a cute little bakery! It's on the second floor of the shopping center, right above tea station. I think the owners are korean but I'm not too sure. I felt like a kid in the candy store and bought about 20$ worth of cakes. They have everything from green tea cake to green tea macaroons. I got some chocolate almond Biscotti's, which were my favorite. My boyfriend got a cinnamon twist thing which was delicious as well. I saw on the corner of my eye they do cake orders as well. I'm so glad I found this place, it would be a great place to have some tea with a macaroon.
