This is by far my favorite place... this bakery has been around for 18yrs... A lot has changed with this bakery... I miss their doughnuts and warm bread and lunch time boarshead lunch meat sandwhiches...\nButtt the cakes, cookies, eclaires, dream cakes, macaroons, black and white cookies, the slices of cake the mini carrot cakes and brownies... yummmm. My favorite are the thumb prints and the cannoli are amazing...\nGo in check this place out I will forever love The Wee Bakery...
