I've been going to this tanning salon for over a year.. the service is great and there's never a long wait time. Even after having a membership here for so long, I'm still wowed by the customer service every time I go in.. Especially from Jill. She always remembers my name and takes time to make sure I understand all the different beds and packages they offer.
