Items I tried:\n- Sausage and peppers pizza\n- Baby Kale salad \n\n800 degrees is located right off Las Vegas Blvd in front of the revamped entrance to the Monte Carlo Casino. \n\nI wanted a casual and quick place to have dinner while in town for business. Pizza looked good and I dropped in for a quick bite. \n\nThe layout and large dining room make 800 degrees really inviting. Ordering is similar to Blaze Pizza where you either pick a pizza from their menu or build your own. Build your own comes with a base you select and each addition topping was $1.50. \n\nI went for the Sausage and Peppers for $14.95. Yes you read it right. That's quite expensive for a personal pizza with six slices, but this is Vegas mind you. \n\nThe pizza was ok, it lacked sauce in my opinion. While the dough was nice and chewy I was expecting a nicer crunch on the bottom of the pizza that just wasn't there. I was let down to say the least. \n\nI also went with their Baby Kale salad for some greens in my diet. The salad was tossed in balsamic vinaigrette and topped with pine nuts, dried figs, and goat cheese. All this for $8 for the small size which was actually pretty big. \n\nI enjoyed the salad far more than the pizza honestly. However there were a few not so pleasing looking pieces of leafy greens that should have been picked out. \n\n800 degrees is a good spot if you must grab a quick bite and don't want to deal with a wait. But their are better options in terms of food quality and taste.
