Cool and innovative gelato shop in DTS. Every flavor we had was amazing and fresh. A few of our favorites is the coconut-lychee and the chocolate chip. The staff is very friendly and knowledgeable with the items they offer. Be sure to check out the Gelato cakes displayed along the wall for special orders.
