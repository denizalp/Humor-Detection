First time ordering tonight. I got the orange chicken with chow me in combo. Roommate got the Mongolian beef combo. Both were delicious. Crab ragoons were full of cream cheese and worth the money. Ordered a small egg drop soup and it was honestly the best egg drop soup. Full of flavor and no tofu. Wait was a little longer for delivery but so worth it. Will be returning.
