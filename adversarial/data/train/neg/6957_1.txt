My friend recommended this place and when I went everything looked good. It was busy and people were enjoying their food. I went at about 8pm, I want to say. I ordered carne Asada fries. The guy cutting the carne asada was wearing a black hat, glasses and had a beard. He was cooking raw carne asada and a customer asked if he was going to wash his hands before putting his chicken tacos together. Well he went to the sink, wiped his hands off with paper towels. He did not wash them. And put on gloves. Then he finished making a chicken taco. Yes he put on gloves but he still handled the outside of those gloves prior to putting them on. I would not recommend this place to anyone. On the bright side, the bartender had great customer service and was polite. (My 2 cents, I think this place needs stricter policies and a strict supervisor.)\n\nPs the lady behind the counter at line 4 who does the salsa and sour cream is not very attentive or nice.
