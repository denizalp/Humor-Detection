Very quaint spot, Cozy and modern. \nThe food was good, I was disappointed with the portions. Our waiter said it was family style but I'm not sure what size family he meant because for a party of 3 small women, it was barely enough for us.  He was kind but not super attentive. We also had drunk all of our water and without us requesting another bottle, they brought one. Only thing is, we didn't know we were being charged for it without our consent.\nThe brown bagged apple pie with salted caramel ice cream was superb however, as well as the white sangria.
