2nd time trying out Eggslut, first time to review, definitely will be coming here each time I go to Vegas. If you're looking for a simple meal, yet decently priced (for Vegas standards), you can't go wrong at all. Located on the 2nd floor of The Cosmopolitan, there is often a line to order food, could either be really long (late breakfast\/lunch) or short (dinner, early morning).\n\nThe menu is pretty simple: all variations of egg plates, a few other sandwiches, and even a burger. Both times I got the Bacon, Egg, and Cheese sandwich....excellent! Decently sized, the bacon is crisp with every bite, egg is perfectly cooked and melts in your mouth after each bite with the cheese and ketchup....perfection!\n\nMy only big gripe, $5 each drinks?! A small cup of black coffee, small orange juice, small cold brew...all $5. Pretty steep. I would suggest to bring your own drink from the casinos or Starbucks. Other than that, this place is an A+...is it worth the wait? Depends on how far the line is. Past the bathroom doors around the corner...come back later.
