Integrity isn't often a word that you associate necessarily with your dentist, however it is certainly what comes to my mind when I think of Dr. Rothrock. He is thorough, kind, and exudes sincere care for his patients thus doing whatever is best for them. I regularly recommend Dr. Rothrock to both those who are searching for a dentist or those who are looking for a better experience at the dentist office.
