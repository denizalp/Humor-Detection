Let's start off with saying that this place is incredibly small. However, don't let that stop you from visiting this place because this place has some of the most delicious pizza.\n\nThe chicken shawarma pizza is absolutely amazing here, from the dough to the toppings to the garlic and hot sauce, this is one amazing pizzeria. It is however, very heavy so unless you're ok with feeling sluggish and incrediblely full or you have with you a decent amount of friends, I suggest getting a small.
