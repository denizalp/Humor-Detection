Ok so I left the University Area of Charlotte a month ago and I still cannot find decent Thai food in WS, but I digress!!\n\nI love this place! I've gotten almost everything on the menu and it is flavorful and mouth wateringly good.  I hate when Thai food is just spicy and your mouth is just filled with hot instead of the flavor.  Thai House really gives you flavor and spice. Don't get me wrong, I love my food spicy but I want flavor too dang it!!!  I normally get the Chicken Pad Thai (7 stars because it's extra extra spicy) and extra bean sprouts.  (I get them for free because I used to go A LOT but I think they are only $1 extra normally...it's worth it!)  When I want to switch it up, I will get the Tom Kha soup and an order of deep fried spring rolls...SOOOOOO GOOOD! \n\nAs for price, I would go for lunch because it's actually pretty cheap like $7.95 or something like that and you get a whole bunch of food. (soup, deep fried spring roll and entree) My Pad Thai is normally $10.95 during dinner time but they give you A LOT, so I justify it by eating it for two meals.  \n\nAs for the service, you can't get any better.  I ordered my food to go and then went to Maggie Moo's to get yummies and they delivered my food to me while I was at Maggie Moo's!  So NICE!! :) \n\n4 1\/2 stars! :)  \n\nI miss you Thai House! :)
