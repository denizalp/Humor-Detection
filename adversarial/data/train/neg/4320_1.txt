Venue is beautiful but that's about it. For some reason the night we went (three-day weekend) was filled with an older crowd. I would say about 60% was in their 40's and 50's. You apparently don't have to dress to impress, I saw a woman just wear a white tank top and pants that looked like PJs and lots of guys just wearing jeans. Music was mediocre the DJ played lots of top 40's hits that I would normally hear at a high school dance. Pretty disappointed!!! If you like a venue with people that dress sharper with EDM and to dance among a younger crowd (20's to 30's), I would try XS or Marquee.
