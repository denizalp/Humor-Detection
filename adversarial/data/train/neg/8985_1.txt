I rate this place 3 stars because it didn't leave an impression on me.\n\nThere was kobe beef, so the good part is that you could get unlimited amounts of it, which my friends all did to make their 40-50 bucks per person worth it. haha\n\nThere was soup, thank goodness. I don't remember seeing\/eating icecream...\n\nwell anyways, if I had to compare this buffet with the aria buffet, I'd eat at Arias ANYDAY!
