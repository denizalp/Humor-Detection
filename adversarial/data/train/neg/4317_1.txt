I will absolutely be recommending National Stone to anyone that is in the market for countertops.  We only had them do a small job for a kitchen island in white and gray quartz.  It looks amazing!  Moses was very friendly and offered great suggestions, Theresa provided me advice on which materials would be best, and Mo and his crew were on time, professional, and pleasant to deal with!  Thanks for making this such an easy project!
