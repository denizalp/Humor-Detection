Went to the grand opening today.  I had the brisket and the pulled pork. It was absolutely moist and very tasty on its own. The home made BBQ sauce was excellent. The corn muffins and bacon maple donuts were delicious as well. \n\nI would totally recommend this place over any of the other bbq joints around the area.   Although I live far from the restaurant I will be coming often.
