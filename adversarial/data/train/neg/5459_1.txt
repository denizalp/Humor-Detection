Dr. Gandhi is great! My old crown fell off this morning that a previous dentist years ago installed. He was very honest and told me my tooth was in good shape so he re cemented the crown instead of selling me a new one. He is very kind and I've been going to his office for awhile.  Everyone puts you at ease and I will continue going. \nThanks Dr. Gandhi!!
