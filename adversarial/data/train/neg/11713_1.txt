Imagine another negative review for this location.\n\nThe Curly fries were cold, The diet coke was flat, and the ad I am subjected to 50 times a day was not honored at this location. \n\nCompanies should hire someone to read the reviews and address the issues. Needless to say my poor GF didn't want get forced in to 2 combo meals so she opted to just get an order of fries. Well it was unfair and when I realized the she did not one I threw mine in the trash. I will never know if they are any good because I will not go back. Now we are going to drive over to Gyro Time on Charleston and go where we know we will get what is advertised and at a fair price.
