Buyer beware!!!  I reserved a deluxe King on Expedia for my daughter, only to find out King beds are first come, first serve and deluxe (larger) rooms don't exist.  The manager said verbatim, \"Mam, I can't build you a bigger room.  Our king beds are first come first serve.\"   Her counter offer was to feed them free breakfasts for 3 days.  I also spoke with one of her staff just yesterday, to reserve an extra day, and he verified the reservation for a deluxe king. \n\nI called the day after making reservations to verify the \"king deluxe\" being a larger room with a king bed.  Their employee told me the room was larger and with a king bed.  That's two employees from the hotel that gave me wrong information.  \n\nI guess reservations mean nothing.  I'd give them a zero star, but it's not an option.
