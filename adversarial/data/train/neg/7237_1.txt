I visited here because I bought a coupon book that gives 2 people one free hour of jump time. I'm usually not fond of jumping but I came and brought my little brother for a spring break activity. I loved it here! The staff are all really friendly and interactive and they definitely supervise and coordinate everyone well! I was shocked at the other reviews I saw on here because my experience here was a great one! I would definitely come back to extreme air versus going to another place like airworks. They have a pretty intense obstacle course and an air bag jumping zone too so that was a plus as well! I really liked going here and would be glad to come back.
