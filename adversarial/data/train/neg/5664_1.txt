Randomly read about this place on Yelp and I'm glad I was able to check it out! The hummus was EXCELLENT and my food (Turkey Burger Sliders) were as expected, though nothing to write home about. My friend had the Open-Faced Grilled Cheese and after having a tiny taste I wish I would have gone with that instead. \n\nThe staff was very friendly and communicated continously about the timing of our food and beverages, which I always appreciate. I will definitely be back again! \n\nJust a tip... when you have specials \"moments\" that change daily, maybe limit it to one or two. Our server read off, I believe, three and I could barely wrap my head around what she said before she proceeded with the next item. If you do have multiple options it would've helped to had a visual reference to review.
