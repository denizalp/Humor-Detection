The service is 5 star, but the food taste like Panda Express, I waited 2.5 literally for our main entree. The potsticker taste like the one from Costco, the sweet beef taste like candy. The portion is so little. A lot of customer last night was so disappointed. The saving grace is the ambiance. If you are looking for a good food this is not the place but if you want a great service this is the place.
