Hmmmm...this one is tough. I loved my sales agent Marc. LOVE my car! I feel like I got a great deal, it wasn't hard or shady at all. Just kind of knew what I want, found it, paid cash. Pretty simple. I've owned a Lexus before-see my review for Chandler Lexus! So that part was fine. I think a few things that were handed off to others within the dealership could have been better but overall, pretty good experience. I expressed some frustrations and when Marc was involved, they were resolved quickly and easily. The dealership is nice and clean and they seem pretty attentive in the showroom. I can't say the same for the service department, but, I have only been back one time. I was told my service advisor was still on lunch and had a few minutes left-but yet he was just in the back-yeah anyway. I'll probably take my new car to Chandler for service now. I always had a great experience there. But if you are shopping for a vehicle, go see Marc Dent. Great guy!
