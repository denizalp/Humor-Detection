Tina is a very nice and patient hair stylist. I saw the reviews and decided to give it a try and it was a great choice. Unlike most of the hair stylists, tina takes the time to listen to what I want provide suggestions. Most importantly, she didn't cut my hair shorter than what I my preferred hair length would be. The price is reasonable. \n\n1 tip: if you want to have a good hair wash and massage, this is not the place.
