Avoid Stockton Dermatology if you possibly can.  This doctor and her staff do not care about solving everyday skin problems you might have; they only care about getting you interested in cosmetic procedures that bring high profits.  \n\nIf you are a new patient, expect to wait months before you get an appointment.  Once you get an appointment (only after the staff have determined that you have a generous enough insurance plan to pay their fees), you will notice that this is a huge operation employing what seems like dozens of people to service only one doctor.  On entering the office, you will be bombarded with advertisements for cosmetic procedures such as wrinkle erasing laser treatments.  (No wonder there were so many BMWs and Mercedes in the parking lot.)  \n\nExpect to spend about two hours at your first visit, much of it filling out paperwork to make sure you can pay, and the rest of the time just waiting and waiting and waiting.  Also, don't expect to actually see the doctor if you don't have a problem that does not require some money-making procedure.  \n\nIn the final analysis, Stockton Dermatology is less about curing patients' skin problems and more about squeezing as much money as possible from our health delivery system.  This type business is the reason that we in the United States pay more in health costs than anyone else in the world and get only mediocre results.
