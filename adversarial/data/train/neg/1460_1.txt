A great local spot for burgers, fries, onion rings and other sandwiches. You can also pile on your own toppings yourself and they have a salad bar (if you're into that). My favorite is the teriyaki chicken sandwich that comes with a slice of pineapple for about $6. I get it on wheat with no cheese and load it up with onions and jalape√±os myself (no extra charge). A good local healthy option. \n\nThe gigantic burgers with multiple patties and cheese are also amazing in moderation. Everything is made to order. Staff are friendly. Cool place with good value.
