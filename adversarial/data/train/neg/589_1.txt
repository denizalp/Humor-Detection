Restaurant had a warm ambiance, very rustic with a musky, wood burning smell. Service was quite attentive as well! \n\n-Charcuterie Board (selection of in house cured meats) - $19\nI don't recall the exact items on the board, but I believe there were duck prosciutto, N'Djua, prosciutto, Cotechino (?) and salami. The duck prosciutto stood out to me the most. I didn't like the cotechino (?) as it was quite bland and the texture was a bit too soft for my liking. \n\n-Big Wings - $16\nThese turkey wings were.. well, BIG! The meat was tender and the maple & mustard sauce were amazing. The sweetness from the maple wasn't too overpowering and there was just enough mustard to bring out the heat. I didn't care for the blue cheese dip but I liked how the blue cheese was really subtle.
