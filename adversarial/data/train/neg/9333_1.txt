AMAZING PLACE! I've gone here numerous times and I think I consider myself a regular here. From the very first visit, I was greeted from the incredible staff and was pleasantly surprised from the food. I remember I was automatically hooked from that first bite. I have never had a bad experience here. Prices is a little expensive for a hit dog, but I think to get what you pay for. The bathroom is actually very clean and smells great. There's always something interesting playing on the tvs, and there's plenty of variety on the menu. Only small complaint I could have is that sometimes there's a lot of topping on a hotdog, and it tends to fall apart. But that's completely ok. Other than that, I don't know what else I could find that's wrong. Oh, the place is always kept clean and all staff is friendly. Don't think twice about the place! Eat here!!!!
