I will start off by saying the vegan menu is excellent! I honestly did like everything and I would recommend vegans going there for sure because they use better ingredients than most other vegan restaurants. I had the vegan meatballs and they offer a few sauces to try with it and they were all good.\n\n I'm also a meat eater so I ordered the cajun chicken alfredo because thats what was recommended popular. I tried it and it was just grainy to each bite and not at all what I expected. If you like cheese with a side of spice and chicken then this would be your go to (but remember; grainy texture). \n\nI politely told my server that I was not satisfied with my order and to just swap it out with the spaghetti and meatballs. He completely understood (from what I could tell) and about 10 minutes later I got my new order. My first bite was amazing, totally worth it. After a couple more bites, even better. But this is what got to me, and this is EVERYONE'S worst fear at a restaurant. I spooled my fork to get a nice spoonful of everything and stared at my next bite and saw a nice thick black hair in it!!\n\nThis was flipping gross and what was worse is that it didn't look like it fell out, it looked like it was plucked out and placed in my plate because a nice white ROOT tip was on the end. I stayed calm (unlike most people) and I already felt bad I swapped out my plate but my friend said something to our waiter and he apologized and said he would he get my friend dessert (I guess for us all??). Instead of me FREAKING OUT, I was calm and making it an eventful experience. At the end he still billed me for the appetizer I ordered earlier (which I know is fair, but at the same time; a hair. come on.) \n\nI will not be going here again because aside of the big thick black hair in my spaghetti and meatballs, I left hungry. (They didnt offer another plate for me to have or anything).
