I booked a trip through them. I left a day early due to their error on dates on the website\/ flyer, and gave them ample notice when I noticed they changed the dates.\nThey told me they could not give any money back. Fine.\nOn the trip, another couple mentioned how they got $200 back for leaving a day early. \nThey also got $750 back each for the company backing out of airfare tickets. We got $600 back. \nI wouldn't recommend this shop, as there are a few in Pittsburgh area, due to unfair, un organization, and greediness of the owners.
