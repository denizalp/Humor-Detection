Pricey. Like most of Vegas, this place looks and smells\ngreat. Food - it hit the spot but I won't wake up in the\nmiddle of the night screaming Noodles Asia! like she was\nsome long lost hot lover I wish I had married. No. This\nis the type of place you just go to because you're starving \nand just tired of walking and hey - open till 3AM. Almost\nlike New York! This place is right off the casino floor in \na little corner within The Venetian. I had the Dan Dan \nNoodles. Very filling but a little dry and not as flavorful \nas I was hoping for. The service was very attentive and decent\nthough.
