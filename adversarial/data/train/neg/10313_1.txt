I have been attending the yoga classes for some time now and I really like the atmosphere and the teachers. They offer different classes every day - different difficulty levels and styles. All instructors are great. Small class sizes. Not a hot yoga. Have not used the hair salon or spa services but it's a cute place that appears small but has more than everything under one roof
