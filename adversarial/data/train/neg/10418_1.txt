This place has the rudest customer service I've ever encountered..they act like there doing you a favor by speaking to you not even knowing the situation why your vehicle is there..I don't know who trains the staff if I was the boss I would be ashamed at my employees for being like that to customers.invest in some customer service training because you never know who will walk in to your business..my vehicle was totaled in an accident not taken for breaking the law in any way but they made me feel like the criminal..I would give it zero stars but that is not an option.
