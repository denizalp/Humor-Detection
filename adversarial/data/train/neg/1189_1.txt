The burgers are pretty decent but way too overpriced. What keeps me coming back is that damn Crack sauce on their fries. Maybe I'll skip the burger and just stick with the fries next time. Otherwise pretty good but the employees can be trained to smile a little bit more to give that \"welcome\" feeling.
