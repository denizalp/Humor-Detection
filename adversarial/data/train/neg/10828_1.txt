DO NOT GO HERE!! If I can give zero stars, I would. This place has the WORST customer service in the world!! The girl at the front desk, Rachel, was very short with me when I came in, she didn't even look at me, she made me feel like I was bothering her. \n\nI bought a tire (I'm assuming it's new, no one said anything) here after I saw my front passenger tire had to be replaced. Rachel asked which tire it was, took notes on what type of tire I needed, asked for my key, and told me it was a 30 min. to an hour wait. She didn't even look at my car\/tire before she printed the paper that I needed to sign! \n\nTo top it off, my front passenger tire has been leaking for two weeks and I had to come back to have them check it out. \n\nCrappy overall service!
