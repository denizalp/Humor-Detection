I will echo some of the sentiment on the recent reviews. I have stayed at this Sheraton at least 7 or 8 times in the last few years and the service levels have plummeted during my last few stays. There are no smiles at the Gold\/Platinum SPG check-in, some sort of problem every time I step up to the desk. Slow service, telling me that there is a problem with my reservation, never any upgrades available (and treated with contempt whenever I ask), and being told I am wrong a number of times. I have never encountered Bell staff as rude as at the Sheraton Centre Hotel. Unloading or getting a cab is a nightmare.\n\nAs for the rooms, they are nowhere near what you would expect from a Sheraton property. Tired, awkward and need some serious updating. How much does a paint job cost for the bathrooms?!\n\nAnyways, this will be my last stay here. There are MUCH better options for the money.
