Got the best choice platter. Good variety. Pieces were a but small, but it is reflected in the price of the platter, so it was actually good value, considering that the platter included scallops and uni. The service was a bit slow, despite the restaurant being half empty.\n\nQuality: 7.5\/10. Service: 7\/10. Value: 9\/10. Overall: 8\/10 (not an average).
