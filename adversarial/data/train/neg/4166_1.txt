This place is unpretentious with simple italian fare that is freshly sourced and freshly made. I had the tagliatelle which I thought was lacking in mushrooms, but the sauce was very well done, the pasta al dente as it should be, and you could tell that they made it that morning. A friend and I were there for PaintNight which they host on a weekly basis in their dining room. We ended the night hanging out at the bar where both the bartender, and one of the owners were super friendly. Watching the bartender serve mixed drinks is really amazing, you can tell he really loves what he does and is part of the resurging cocktail culture in Toronto. This spot also has very accessible parking for those coming in from out of town. And the decor is very nice, great place for a first date if you're worried that your date and you might not have much in the way of conversation, since you can just look around and find something to comment on.
