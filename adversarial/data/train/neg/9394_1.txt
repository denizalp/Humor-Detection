Love the location and the Bass Pro Shop that is attached to the casino. I have not stayed in the hotel, but I have gambled and ate here a few times. I love to go to their Hawaiian buffet on Saturday nights (don't forget to sign up for a players card) and the sports book is small, straight to the point and near the exit\/entrance of self parking!
