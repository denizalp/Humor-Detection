EXTREMELY UNPROFESSIONAL I have never received worse service at any other Autozone. All I wanted to do was order parts and leave went in and walked up to the counter checked to see if correct parts were in stock they were and the employee went to grab them in the back. The employee came back with correct parts so far no problems whatsoever Here is where shit hit the fan. If the employee kept his mouth shut. He asked what I was working on and it was all downhill from there. He insisted on telling me what parts I actually needed. Now he doesn't know I used to be a mechanic and I understand what I'm doing but he insisted on telling me I was wrong. Now here is where I lost my patience. I simply told the guy if I have the wrong parts for the job then you'll see me later but no he insisted and I quote \"Jackasses like me don't come back they have they're trucks towed to a real mechanic!\" I don't have the time to deal with someone who's career is to work at Autozone at that point I had already paid so simply walked away from the situation but that is NOT how you treat customers no excuse whatsoever. Unfortunately I do not remember the employees name but he wore a grey shirt (pretty sure that means he was part of management) and had spiked hair\/Mohawk. I would not recommend you go to this Autozone location. No other employee seemed to think anything was wrong for what he said to a customer. From now on I'll just go to the O'Reilys across the street.
