WOW! Other than it being too loud, there is nothing not to like. A local co-worker took me here for lunch and I had the Gluten-free penne carbonara. Stuffed with lots of fresh cream, grated cheese, bacon, onions, and peas, it was very rich and too much for me to finish. This was one of the best meals that I have had in the last 3 weeks. A+++
