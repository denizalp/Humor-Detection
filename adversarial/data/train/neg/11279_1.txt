ZERO STARS!\nRenting a vehicle from this car rental company was the worst experience we\"ve ever had. We had to take two shuttles to get there. The wait for the second shuttle was long. The car rental place was disgusting and looked like no one had ever taken the time to make it look presentable. The employee who helped us seemed to be more interested in selling us show tickets, tours, etc. He sounded like a slick use car salesman! We asked about returning the vehicle 2 hours after the original time we had reserved the vehicle for and he said we had to pay another full day, which was a lie because we later called and were told that was not so. The vehicle they wanted to give us had dents and the entire vehicle was dirty. It was obvious, they didnt washed it. On the passenger side windshield, there were foot prints that were visible. The seats were filthy! They gave us another vehicle and that vehicle had stained seats. It seems all they vehicles have alot of wear and tear. I took pictures of both vehicles and wish I could upload them. I'll never use Ace again!
