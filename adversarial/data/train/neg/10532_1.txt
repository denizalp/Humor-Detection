This location is also a u-haul rental location; however, I do not recommend picking up at this location. \nThe truck we got was banged up and dirty. There was a bug collection goin on all. On top of that the car dolly they were going to give us had tire straps that were completely ripped up which would have in no way been able to safely secure my car during our cross country move from AZ to NC. They didn't have a backup dolly so we were forced to drive to another location that only had 1 person working at the counter. This whole ordeal caused us to be behind schedule by 2 hours. :\/ \nTo the employees, can you please ensure that the equipment you rent out is clean and safe to use. Seriously my car could have snapped off and killed someone!\nTo the renters, you'll be payin for it so always do the double check. :)
