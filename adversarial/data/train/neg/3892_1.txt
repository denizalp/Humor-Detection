I've never heard of Freddy's until I was visiting Las Vegas over a weekend, I saw it and thought \"wow, steak burgers and frozen custard sounds delicious.\".  I ended up going for lunch on the way out of town and ordered a regular steak burger with cheese, it did NOT disappoint, the meat was very flavorful and all the ingredients tasted fresh.  The fries were an interesting \"shoestring\" variety but were good.  I ordered a regular vanilla shake which I believe is made from the frozen custard and WOW it was delicious, tasted similar to how a larger chains shakes tasted back in the 80's before they changed them and made them suck.  I will definitely be back next time I'm in Vegas, or even in SoCal on my way down to LA since I see there's one in Bakersfield.
