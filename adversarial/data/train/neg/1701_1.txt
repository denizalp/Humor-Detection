Horrible dealership. Customer service is very bad and the guy who \"helped\" us, Adrian had low manners. Dude had the audacity to question things out of his range with disrespect. \nAlso, if you think of buying a car here first stop by the back. You will see cars that are being fixed from car accidents. I am certain they fix most of the cars and put them on sale. Look closely into the details of the car and make sure they're all aligned or at least don't look fixed up so you don't make a mistake. Thankful I didn't purchase anything from here.
