This was my first visit to Tuckys BBQ. They had a nice little dining room with picnic tables, it was very clean and comfortable.  We placed our order with cashier she was very friendly and walked me through the family meal with three choices of meat. We got baby back ribs, shredded pork, andouille sausage, and brisket along with mac and cheese, loaded baked potato, and pot salad which we ordered to go. All the meats had fantastic flavor the ribs were my favorite they were super tender and flavorful best I've tasted hands down!  Sides were also really good. I could of done without the cornbread muffins which were a bit dry. The best touch was the three BBQ sauces which were self serve and served hot, they must of been homemade??  I'll be back with my family for sure nice job!!!
