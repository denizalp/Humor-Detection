*Please note, I'm writing in review of the happy hour only.\n\nI recently discovered this happy hour gem with some girl friends, and it has quickly become a favorite in the portfolio (instead of ladies who lunch, I guess we're ladies who drink).  The patio is fantastic and while I often get in ruts with beer and wine, Bloom's martini menu is enough to get anyone back onto the hard stuff!  My favorite is the Elderflower Drop, a vodka-based drink with St. Germain that I can't seem to re-create on my own, no matter how hard I try.  Their drinks do have that hand-crafted-mixologist vibe, so I guess I shouldn't be surprised.  For $4-5\/drink, these premium cocktails are a great deal!\n\nAdditionally, the HH food menu would make any foodie happy and has a really nice variety of small plates.  I'd confidently recommend the tuna, smoked salmon or artichoke hearts -- though I've tried most of the apps on the menu and have never been disappointed.  If you like truffle oil, you're in luck at this place as it seems to be laced into dishes at every other turn!\n\nThe only things preventing me from giving this 5 stars are the HH time (HH ends at six, which is hard to make if you have a job like mine) and the service, which has been okay-to-mediocre during most of my visits.  I'd like to think it's because they just happen to be really busy, and not that they are actually forgetting to check on our table  ;-)\n\nOverall, an unexpectedly great happy hour spot.
