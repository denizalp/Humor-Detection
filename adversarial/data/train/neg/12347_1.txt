Eccentric, simple, original, fun, what a blast, Las Vegas Gold Spike's free roller skating event titled Down and Derby is a must each week. I miss it now that I am back in the office. Thinking about how much fun we all had is sad. Gold Spike rocks. No wonder MTV picked Gold Spike to host their TV show Real World.
