One of my new fav spots in the city. Awesome atmosphere, attentive staff including the chefs. We were lucky enough to be seated at the bar to watch the action. Had very engaging conversations with the chefs who were super friendly and interested in how we enjoyed the food. My favourite dish was the wagyu beef, fried chicken (so juicy!!) followed by the mussels. But my husband would say he enjoy the jambalaya which is done in a unique way. Personally the shortrib to me was only ok. But the cooking staff are proud of this dish and highly recommended it so we tried it. The cocktails were yummy! When we come again, I want to try their Tennessee ham and a lot of other things! Great dinner!
