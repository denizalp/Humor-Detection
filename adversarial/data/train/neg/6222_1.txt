I saw Hexx on Yelp before my trip to Vegas, and when we happened on it walking through Paris, I decided it was destiny.\n \nOn our first stop to Hexx, my husband and I decided to share a Chocolate Chip Cookie Ice Cream Sandwich, with Cookies n Cream ice cream. And it was delicious. My only complaint would be that there's not enough ice cream for the cookies. The cookies are really good, but really rich and I needed more ice cream to match the cookie.\n \nThe second time we stuck with ice cream sandwiches, but each got our own. This time was Chocolate Chip cookies with Mint Chip ice cream. So good. But when I had my own cookie it was really too much cookie for the amount of ice cream. And I couldn't eat it fast enough before it started melting and I ended up dripping quite a bit of mint chip ice cream all over my pants. #Classy Next time I'd stick to sharing one sandwich, it was just too rich to eat by myself. And too much money to not eat the whole thing.\n \nHexx was delicious. A bit pricy, but it's Vegas. We didn't try anything by ice cream though. I couldn't find price tags on any of their chocolate bars, so I skipped them.
