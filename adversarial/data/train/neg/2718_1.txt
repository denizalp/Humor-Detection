I sent my wife here for a scavenger hunt. The associates we extremely helpful and cooperative with my elaborate plan. However last minute snags caused this destination to be pushed back. \n\nShe did visit Evolve on another day and the feedback I received from my wife was incredible. She said everyone was extremely helpful and kind. They made her feel comfortable. She received a facial and eyebrows service. She couldn't be happier with the amount of attention she was given by each associate. \n\nBy her verbal review, I highly recommend this place.
