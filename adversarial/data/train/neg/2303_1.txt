Unbelievably RUDE manager (Maron) when a friend of mine asked if they discount items after a certain amount of time on the shelves (like they do at another Madison St. Vincent De Paul). Honest question = extremely sarcastic, unfair, unreasonable, idiotic answer. Word of mouth goes far and so far we've got several people now unwilling to go to this store specifically.  If you hate your job so much, leave it!
