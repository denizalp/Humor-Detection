It's 3:30 pm, my legs were shot, my tummy was rumbling, and the juice on my phone was running dangerously low---I needed free Wifi, a place to charge my phone, and a snack before dinner --- STAT!\n\nMy sister and I ended up sharing pachas aux poulet (chicken) and pachas aux Ã©pinards (spinach). Both were flaky and crispy on the outside, and moist on the inside. In fact, much to our surprise, one of them squirted on the table when we cut it open. Whoops!\n\nThis spot also has cute decor, free Wifi, and lots of power outlets. Great place to stop by for a quick bite!
