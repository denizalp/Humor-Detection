I came here on the recommendation of a friend since I tend to have problems with heel pain. They do a diagnostic on your feet, gait, etc and can help recommend a good shoe for you. I came around lunchtime and waited 30 minutes to have the tests run. Based on my tests, the girl recommended their custom insoles. I am getting ready to start training for a half marathon, so I was down for it. It was pretty cool to see how I treat each foot differently and the employee accounted for this with my insoles. I picked out  pair of tennis shoes for approx $75 and this was after the girl brought out 4-5 pairs of shoes based on the type that was best for my feet. I tell you, though, I got some nasty sticker shock when I got to the register and paid. My custom insoles were $75!!! Holy hell, I had no idea. I was really annoyed because when the girl told me she was going to make them for me, I felt that she should have disclosed the cost. I guess I should have asked but I was the inexperienced one in the process and I don't like feeling like I was taken advantage of. On a positive note, their return policy is pretty amazing. 90 days and if you don't like your shoes, you can take them back even if you have been running in them. Hopefully, my insoles will prove to be worth it during my training but that remains to be seen.
