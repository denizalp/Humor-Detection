Don't ever go to the Quick C car wash off Celanese Rd across from Outback. They broke a mirror on his truck last week. He has been in contact with the manager several times and today she tells him that the owner said they won't pay for it because it didn't happen there. The owner won't even speak with him. The owner told the manager to not call him but to wait til he called because the owner knew he would call, instead of just simply calling. This is bad business and I want to make sure everyone knows!!!!!!
