Most disgusting unprofessional Casino I have ever too, I am a diamond member first they charge me $250 stating that my hotel smell like smoke then security walks up to me harasses me accuses me of something I have never did and told me this is his Casino I had to leave. The security then start stating that's how you take care of that B****.... I have never been treated the way I was at Silverton Casino
