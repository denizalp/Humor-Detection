I had a bad experience here because the service was really bad, we sat down for 10 mins before we called a waitress that was just talking to two other waitresses. She said just a moment and continued talking to them. Finally another waitress came to take our drink order, then she brought everyone's drinks but my water. So I asked again after 15 mins I had to ask again. All in all food was ok but service was really off today. (Mon 3\/25\/13)
