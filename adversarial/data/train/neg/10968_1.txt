Banh mi (Vietnamese subs) are not the norm around my side of town, but since this is near school and doesn't require a detour from my normal routes, It hits the spot. \n\nWas craving a BBQ Pork sandwich, loaded with vegetables including cucumbers, carrots and the white one (which is so honestly called \"white carrot\" when translated my way) and Cilantro! \n\nDelicious, friendly staff and the bread comes out warm (possibly due to heating in a conventional oven before the goodies are inserted) but still nonetheless satisfying. I prefer this style of banh mi versus the Lee's baguettes or any baguettes for that matter since they're much tougher and tend to shred the top of my mouth. \n\nDefinitely recommended, but will have to try other dishes when I am inclined to do so. :)
