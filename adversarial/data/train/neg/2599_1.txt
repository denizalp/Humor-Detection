Tom has been tireless, driven, and highly successful while selling our house. We left the state shortly after putting the house on the market, and he took care of so many things that would have been very difficult for us to do long-distance! He was always professional, checking in on a regular basis to keep us in the loop, and advise us on the best course of action. I couldn't have hoped for someone as involved and efficient as he is! \n\nThe caliber of his work - as well as the Yelp reviews - tell you how busy of a guy he is, but he always made us feel like we were his only client. He always called us back promptly and followed through, and he turned what could have been a miserable experience into a pleasant and very successful one! I highly recommend Tom to all of my Arizona friends.
