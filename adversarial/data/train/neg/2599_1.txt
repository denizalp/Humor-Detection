This place offers great, fast service. I had forgotten a nice set of comforters here for months and when I visited the guy went through a bunch of left over orders until he found mine. Although he did not have to, he went out of his way to make sure I got my forgotten items. I have been frequenting this cleaner for over a year and the service is predictably good.
