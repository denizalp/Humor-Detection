Oh yes. Went here while visiting relatives in AZ. Amazing food, excellent service. \n\nWhat I really liked is that in an indie restaurant like this you get people that really seem happy to be working there as opposed to corp-chain restaurants. They know what they are serving, and they know they are serving great food.\n\nStarted with the crispy egg rolls - these are the famous egg rolls that are delicious - wrap them in the lettuce & mint for a proper treat. Then had the Specialty pork ribs - key here is eat them while hot (made the mistake of talking instead of eating). Finished with the Filet Mignon Shaken Beef - which were, well yes, amazing.\n\nHere's a hint - order the soup. The waiter kind of downplayed the soup as being very simple. Well, it may look simple, but the flavors just exploded in a great way. When we told the waiter how much we loved it, he explained the ingredients and process of making - and it all made sense.
