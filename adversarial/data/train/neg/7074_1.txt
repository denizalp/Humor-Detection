Family owned and family run, this restaurant is authentic. This is my go-to Italian place in Henderson. I can eat-in or take-out and both are consistently good. \n\nI enjoy their pastas and specials the most it's made fresh from quality ingredients. My favorite pasta is the Tomato Sauce Clams Vongole, it is with real clams in shell - not the canned or jarred kind.
