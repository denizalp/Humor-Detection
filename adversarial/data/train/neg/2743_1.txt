My boyfriend and I ate here late in the evening (9:30-ish) so the restaurant was fairly empty.  We were seated by the pool area and even though the pool was closed, we could still see the fish swimming around in the tank.\n\nWe ordered a pizza (chicken with goat cheese and other things...can't remember the exact name) and entree sized salad to split among the two of us and I had a glass of wine.  The food was excellent and even though we were stuffed, we had to finish the pizza!\n\nThe only negative was that it took our waiter forever to come to our table.  We waited probably 10 minutes for him to even come take our drink orders...when he came, we quickly put in our whole order.  It also took a while for him to come at the end of the meal.
