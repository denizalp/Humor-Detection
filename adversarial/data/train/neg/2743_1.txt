Average at best. \n\nOne of two rotating air vents after workers reinstalled and painted it was installed crooked and neither rotated as they did prior. They fixed the crooked vent. But superintendent didn't seem to give a crap they weren't rotating. Did not offer to repair or replace until I complained a 2nd time. Since they do spin when wind over 20mph I decided to leave as is. No mess was left behind. Office staff a pleasure to deal with.
