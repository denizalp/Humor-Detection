I mean... I know the whole idea of hot topics is to promote teen angst, but holly hell the workers here are the rudest people I've ever encountered in a retail setting... After she went through her whole up sale ordeal (that I'm sure is part of her job.. I've worked in retail) I politely declined. She seemed a little annoyed...Maybe she was having a bad day so I continued being overly nice to her and thanked her for checking my ID and some how I got on the subject of the salon I work at and how we check IDs as well... She then went off on a tangent on how her friend that works at super cuts has the same training as me... I wanted to be like \"okay chick, I don't know what you think I was saying but your acting bat shit crazy over me just telling me where I work\" but I just nodded and smiled, grabbed my stuff and left.  I'd like to say that she was the only one that acted like that and everyone else was nice..  But everyone else stared at me with a blank stare and wasn't any help.
