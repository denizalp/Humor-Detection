So far, so good!!! Jeff came and assessed our moving situation. The bid came in a bit more but that's to be expected. This morning Elias, Alex and Luis arrived on time to pack and move our belongings. Efficient, friendly, professional, etc. These guys were just great!!! Now we move to Arizona! We will update this review when we receive our belongings in AZ in a couple of months!!!
