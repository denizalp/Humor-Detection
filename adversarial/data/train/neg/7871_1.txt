Let me just paint a picture...\n\nWhile I love Arizona and have lived here for 17 years it is always great to get away and explore the world.  I have traveled abroad and domestic to some highly populated and not so populated areas.  \n\nFrom the moment you enter the door you have left everything behind.   I lost the identity I am in Arizona.  The ambience is calming and inviting.  I was not sure exactly where I wanted to sit because each place is unique in it's own.  \n\nI took a wine flight suggested by our server.  They offer an extensive collection of fine wines.  He suggested proper pairing with their extensive small plates.   I prefer creating a meal of small servings to have the opportunity to discover new things each delicious.  The service is impeccable!  Pricing was very reasonable. \n\nWith good company, wine, food and ambience nearly 2 hours had past.  As I got up to leave I was uncertain if this was a place out of downtown London or the hills of Como.  Needless to say I am grateful this is Arizona and has now been a favorite since!\n\nFor all of us in Scottsdale, this is worth the drive every time!
