Been going to CB a lot of  times in CA.. I was like a CB here in AZ !!! I I've been going like 3 times the food is not the same , the service is not the same and the atmosphere really reaks . Where is managment are they really interested for the costumers.. I guess this CB really needs some work. \n\nThe Salad water in it, I had to drain it, Full rack Beef Ribs burnt, the drinks got to beg for more. So where is the service , not even \" Is everything ok, any more Drinks ?\" oh but here they come with the Bill and tell them that you did not eat what you did not like, nope can't take that off the bill. Sorry Claim Jumpers, I'm Jumping off, not coming back .
