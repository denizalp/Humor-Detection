Me and my sister stopped into AZ Pops after hearing about it at work. We came in on a VERY HOT Arizona afternoon looking for a refreshing treat.. And boy did we get just that. I knew going in that they have a wide range of very unique flavors and to my surprise there was MORE than just a wide range. I absolutely love the owner and how she took the time to converse with me and help me pick exactly what I wanted. I will definitely be back. Also they provide samples for you to try & dry ice to take pops home. 5 stars for sure!
