Came here with my friend . We got the branzino and the duck eggs pasta.  The branzino was good. Nothing to write home about but good.  The pasta was ok but kind of cold.   We also got the tiramisu for desert. Didn't love it at all. It was kind of strange tasting.  Service is very incredible here.  Servers are on point and very accurate.
