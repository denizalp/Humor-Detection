It was really a great sty. I've stayed on the strip at some of the other higher end hotels but this is ALMOST right up there with the rest. Incredibly well maintained, amazing rooms with those great large perfect bathrooms and rich looking spaces. Big Screen TV... I think 50\"... but who's watching! Location, Location, Location. It is at the center of everything. The only reason I do not give it 5 stars is that there are a few others that are. I don't want to list them because I don't want to send people elsewhere. It is though amazing and all that Vegas should be!
