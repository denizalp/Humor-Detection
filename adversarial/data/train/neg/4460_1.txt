My husband and I took our 14yo daughter with us for a fun family event.  There are many options when it comes to group paint studios, but few are family friendly like Paint Party Night.  Our instructor Heather had one assistant named Christian who was there to offer help all night.  \n\nDoors were opened half hour before the actual event.  Get there early with some takeout food and drinks and enjoy your meal before painting for the next 2.5hrs.  This is also a great time to wet the entire canvas to soften it up.  There's a tasty Soul Food place next door named Call Me Cake that have great home baked slices of cakes and pies.  \n\nThe instructor Heather was mic'ed up and music is played in the background.  She spoke clearly that it wasn't difficult to follow her directions.  Also, make friends with your neighbors, they may be able to give you some tips on paint mixing ratios etc.  I would encourage everyone to use the instructor's directions as the foundation and guideline and be brave and creative to add in your personal vision to your art.  \n\nWe had a lovely evening at this studio and would recommend Paint Party Night to other families.  Booking directly on the studio website was easy and there was a February special that was not available on Groupon, so check out the website first especially to verify class calendar offerings.
