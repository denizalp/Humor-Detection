Found this place by accident on Yelp looking for a quick breakfast place & fell in Love! The staff was great & really nice (: \nWe sat on the patio , your have a great view of the mountains.\nOrdered the Strawberry French Toast & The Gouda , egg & Applewood Bacon Brizza ( I think it's called that ) .\nWish I could go here everyday!
