Overall I enjoyed my meal and had a good time, but I think my friends and I were a little underwhelmed by our waiter. It seemed like others were getting more attention and jokes from theirs while ours kind of just threw our utensils and food at us which was still funny, but I guess we were expecting more. I ended up getting a Caesar salad and added salmon and was pretty happy with the meal as the salmon was cooked well and they gave a generous sized salad. A couple of us also ordered frozen drinks and got an extra shot I think for an extra $2 which I highly recommend. I think we got the 2nd size and were surprised how much we felt it after 1 drink. Not sure I would return if back in Vegas but glad we experienced it at least once.
