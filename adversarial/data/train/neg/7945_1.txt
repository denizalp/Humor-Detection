Walking in I instantly felt comfortable in this place.  Which is strange because if they wanted this place could be super pretentious, but it's not.  It's AWESOME.  \nThe decor is perfect.I don't even know what to call it, we actually debated it for a good chunk of time while sitting back admiring.  Until the food came and then it was game on!\nWe started with the portabello fries and also the roasted beet and apple salad.  The salad was good but those fries, daaaayyum. Not overly fried, yummy flavor.  Just do it, they were excellent.  \nFor an entree, I ordered the spicy seafood pasta, at the recommendation of our delightful server.  It was in fact, spicy, it was also chock-full overflowing with seafood.  It did not disappoint.  But I'm going to go ahead and repeat - it was SPICY.  Just in case you think it's only a hint of spice, nooooo.  It's some damn good heat.\nA friend ordered the shepherd's pie and damn if it didn't look glorious. The crust was flakey, buttery goodness.  There were 4 of us including a vegetarian and a vegan and EVERYONE loved this place.  That's a pretty difficult thing to pull off.  Just sayin'\nDessert - because we had too.  We got the trio which included flourless chocolate cake, vanilla ice cream, and creme brulee.  OH THAT CREME BRULEE! Delightful.  Scrumptious! The cake was great, I didn't even try the ice cream. I was too full and I needed to eat more of the creme brulee!\nSo if you can't tell. I think this place is the bee's knees and I will most certainly be back on all of my trips to Vegas.
