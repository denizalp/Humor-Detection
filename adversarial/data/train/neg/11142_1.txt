Basis for my starred ratings (which skews heavily to the food or drink):\n1 star:  Never again.\n2 stars:  Poor food, poor experience, extraordinary measures in order for me to come back.\n3 stars:  Average, nothing really special, nothing particularly bad.\n4 stars:  Very good, would definitely return.\n5 stars:  A favorite, one of the best.\n\nJust adding another 5-star review for this place.  One of my favorite restaurants in Phoenix.  Been here a few times and typically opt for the max number of courses.  On our last visit, we ordered a bottle of sake (Dassai) and received the following:\n\nEver so slightly seared fluke in grapeseed oil - excellent\nA small salad with trout and tuna sashimi - very good, the dressing especially\nA sashimi course with aji (horse mackerel), kanpachi (amberjack), and uni (sea urchin) - excellent\nTsukuri Six which consisted of:  o-toro tartar, ankimo (monkfish liver), shrimp with a little caviar, Hokkaido scallops, Kumamoto oyster with uni, and octopus.  The ankimo, shrimp, and oyster were excellent.  The scallops were very good.  The octopus and o-toro tartar were the weakest of the six.\nWagyu beef, ishiyaki-style - excellent\nNigiri course inluding: kanpachi, o-toro, toro, and two other fish I don't remember - excellent\nChawanmushi with seasonal fruit - excellent.\n\nThat's a lot of excellent dishes.  Some things I've had on the menu every single time (the fluke, o-toro tartar, oyster, octopus, Wagyu), and a couple of these I've gotten a little tired of, but there is enough variation from visit to visit that I still love this place.  This visit, we had the most raw preparations than we've ever gotten before.\n\nThe setting is trendy and serene.  The service has always been excellent.  I've never been disappointed in the food here.  I don't think you'll be either.
