I just had my first acupuncture with Kym at Infinite Healing Center she was very gentle very easy to talk to and I never even felt one needle looking forward to coming back for my next treatment I'll keep you posted on if it takes away my pain she also placed needles for weight loss I'm really looking forward to seeing how that works also
