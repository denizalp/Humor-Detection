It's getting three stars because of the PRICES!\n\nA water doesn't need to be 6.50! This company needs to be embarrassed. Water comes from the earth, not from a huge company making processed beverages, so prices for alcoholic drinks need to be 6.50 not A WATER! Calm down on prices!! It's getting really pathetic.\n\nMy hot dog was 9.00, and it comes with chips (and you get no choice of chips) and some chili sauce. Was the food good? Yeah but not worth these prices. A meal like this should have only cost 9.00 dollars, water included. \n\nThis small meal was 16.00! They are taking advance of people and their money.
