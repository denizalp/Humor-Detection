This is the second time we have ate here.  Tonight, I had the arugula salad with goat cheese.  Our server was Case (Casey) and we were so happy with him.  He went the extra steps to ensure we had a great meal and experience. \n\nI love the decor.  Brightly colored, orange, yellow and wood tones.  Everything was clean and the staff was right on the ball.  \n\nWe recommend you come here if you are looking for a great meal and be sure to sit on the patio.
