The carwash is one of the best around! They're very detail oriented and do a great job. I've paid more for upgrades at other car washes and they don't do near as good a job. They have a little bit of a wait but it's worth it. Plus you can shop around their cute market or get coffee or awesome food\/BBQ at the restaurant while you wait
