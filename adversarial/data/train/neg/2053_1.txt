The Root is a cool cafe! I came here for lunch with a friend last week. I had a special salad that had Mediterranean style feta and zatar and a cappuccino that had a good milk-foam-espresso balance. My friend had rice and beans, which had a nice tangy taste and molasses cookie, which was spicy and tasted like fall comfort food to me! What I enjoyed most about the root was the ambience. It had artsy-earthy flair!\n\nThe only drawback of the Root is that I don't live close enough to go back on a regular basis!
