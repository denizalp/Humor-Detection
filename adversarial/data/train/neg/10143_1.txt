Great food! And thank goodness they are moving right across the parking lot to a bigger place, because they were hoppin busy!! Even so, we didn't wait long at all and the super friendly employees and owners Tony and Mike are a breath of fresh air! Can't wait to go to their new place on Val vista Dr.  I think they said in Feburary!  Yay!  Highly recommend.
