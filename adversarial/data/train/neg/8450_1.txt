Typical theater experience with upgraded seats! I have been here twice and both times I sank happily into big cushioned leather seats to enjoy my show. \n\nHowever on my last visit either the AC was out or not turned down low enough. Everyone in our group felt the heat through the entire feature and it definitely took away from the experience.
