I had the golden fried tofu which was really tasty and then I had a chicken dish with cold sesame noodles in peanut sauce with sliced cucumbers which was pretty good too. For my drink I had Taro flavored Bubble Tea with Red Beans and I think diced mango which was very unique tasting and also very good. \n\nUnfortunately I had just come back from playing basketball in extreme heat and my system was a little maladjusted. So it may not necessarily be the fault of the establishment that it fell short of 5 stars. However, relatively speaking I still find Raman Bar to be so far the best.\n\nThe service was friendly and some of the staff even bowed in staying with tradition and authenticity of the culture. I'd like to try this place again next time without preceding it with a rigorous workout in the heat of summer.
