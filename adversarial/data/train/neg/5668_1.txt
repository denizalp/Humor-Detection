My husband and I grabbed dinner here before a show at Knight Theater. The service was very friendly and down-to-earth. The food (for the most part) was delicious. It took a little longer to get our food, especially our last two dishes, but all's well that ends well I suppose. \n\nWe ordered a couple of different oysters. I wish I could remember which ones so I could recommend them because they were delicious. We also did a beet salad and calamari, both of which were great! Our last two dishes, which oddly enough took the longest to come out, fell flat. It was the tilefish and grouper (which was the special). Both dishes were way over seasoned, we couldn't even finish them. \n\nStill, the overall experience was pleasant, and we are excited to go back and try some more stuff. I also want to give it a try for lunch since I work just a few blocks away. Oh! And try the pineapple infused brandy! We got a small sip with our meal and it was really good.
