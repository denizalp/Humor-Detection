Wonderful service and excellent food!  Everything we've ordered has been great.  Our favorites, include the \"Happy Family\" (seafood menu), cheese puffs, veggie egg rolls, Mongolian beef, sweet & sour chicken,  fried rice, and garlic chicken.  We feel the portions are generous and the prices very reasonable.  If you haven't tried it, we recommend you do!
