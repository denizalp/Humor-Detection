This place is a unique dining experience with a great wait staff. I think it's something different and fun to try... I had a pleasant experience and was perfectly comfortable in the dark with our waiter! \n\nWhat I wasn't a fan of was the price of an all-vegetarian meal. This was a surprise date for me- so I didn't check Yelp or know what I was getting into... apparently it's on the customer to ask about food and even though I had some questions it was never disclosed that the menu is all vegetarian- it's definitely an avoided subject. I'm not opposed to vegetables... but five courses of them is a bit much- and if we are paying around $70 a person I'd rather go with fewer courses with either a meat or vegetarian option. Most of the dishes tasted fine. Some courses I enjoyed better than others. The dessert was a bit generic, but it tasted good. \n\nI don't know if there's a philosophy behind not outwardly claiming it's a strict vegetarian menu or what, but I found that odd. Overall I'd try again if they ever decide to adjust their menu.
