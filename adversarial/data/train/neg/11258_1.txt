Great hookah lounge. It's actually a lounge where you can hear each other talk. The owner of this lounge also owns the restaurant next door (amazing gyros, NOT pre-frozen) and they bring the food to you here. The owner is very friendly as well. Wish it was closer to where I live but the drive might be worth it!
