This used to be my favorite Mexican restaurant in Charlotte. When I heard it had new owners, I got a little nervous. (and for good reason) The menu seems to be all mixed up. Very hard to read. A lot of the previous items, my favorites, are no longer there. And the food did not seem fresh at all. For a more Authentic Mexican experience (with a rougher exterior) I would suggest Azteca off of South Blvd.
