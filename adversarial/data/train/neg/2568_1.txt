Normally good, but I had a really BAD EXPERIENCE with customer service, I had the misfortune to have Irene badge #357238 to answer the phone. She couldn't help me, my needs were outside her protocol, not a problem, I get that.  I asked to be transferred to a supervisor, answer \"no\".  I insisted, she refused. I asked to be transferred to anyone one else, she refused. I expressed my frustration, she said it wasn't personal. Repeat several, several times, I asked to be transferred to the complaints department, she refused. She would not transfer me to anyone, period. She insisted she wouldn't budge nor would she help me with my request for a history of insurance claims for the time I was with Zipcar.   This was yesterday, I had to go for a walk to help release the physical stress this interaction with Irene caused my body. \nMy husband, who is on the SAME account, had already received his history and he contacted the person who sent his directly.  She was able to help.  But damned if I will renew with Zipcar lest I run into Irene again.
