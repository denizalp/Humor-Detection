I was very nervous about starting the tattoo removal process, but couldn't be happier that I did. The atmosphere is very clean and comfortable and the staff couldn't be any nicer. They were so patient with me and addressed my fears. They were very thorough during my consultation and set the expectation for what to expect after my session and over the course of the entire treatment. My second appointment is tomorrow and I look forward to continuing the process and am so thankful to have found such a great and professional place to go. I was actually pleasantly surprised by their pricing and look forward to the day that my tattoo is completely gone.
