This store is a best kept secret in the shadow of WalMart. Shopping at WalMart was such a pain. Checkout lines were always long, and you had to park so far from the store.\n\nI discovered Smart and Final a few months ago and have not been back to WalMart. Plenty of fresh (and organic) produce. Easy store layout. Despite being a smaller store, I have no problem finding everything I need. (IE, I'm not running to another store for things they don't carry).\n\nTheir First Street (generic) brand is of high quality and priced right. Overall, their prices are low. They have turned me into a fan.
