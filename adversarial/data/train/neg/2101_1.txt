The service was great, but the waiter was a little pushy. He kept trying to change our minds about the orders. I'm not sure if he just really wanted us to try their specials and experience something new or if he was trying to say that some items on the menu are just not good. I chose a basic breakfast and it was pretty good. The potatoes were seasoned very well. I probably wouldn't eat there again but it was not a bad experience or meal.
