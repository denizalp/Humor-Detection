Great Place. I was impressed and it was more than worth it. My wife and I took our 1 week old baby girl to get some pictures done. Halfway through, Amaya got fussy and needed to eat.  Our photographer Aimee M was awesome and deserves some major probs. Not only did she take great pictures, she was very patient with us and our fussy little one. Our sales guy was nice and helped make the rest of the trip simple. Can't wait to come again ,I would highly recommend dropping by.
