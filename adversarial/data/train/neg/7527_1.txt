One Mary MacLeod's choco chunk shortbread or a bag of grocery store choco chip cookies?  same price.\n\nNo decision here - the taste and texture of Mary MacLeod's shortbread is so wonderful.  Someone else can work through a bag of grocery store cookies while I'm savouring one perfect shortbread.\n\n You can really understand the baker's meaning of 'short'  when the texture is sooo right.\n\nThank you Mary MacLeod.\n\nOne cookie.\n\nPerfection.
