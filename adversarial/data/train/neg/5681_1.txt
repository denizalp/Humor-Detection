Outstanding! You have to try the coxinha, a deep fried dough filled with shredded chicken.  The yucca fries (mandioca frita) are so awesome, you can't just have one.  Saturdays is when they serve the Brazilian national dish, Feijoada, which is a black bean stew with meats served with rice and collard greens.  The cheese bread is another must.  The beef stroganoff was just like my mama's! Best of all, the food is moderately priced.  The staff was super attentive and nice. Will definitely have to go back and visit again!
