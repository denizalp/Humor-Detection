I came here by mistake assuming it was a sushi restaurant I've previously ate at, once I pulled into to parking lot I knew this wasn't the same place but I ordered take out and did not want to be rude and not pick up my order. I stopped in maybe 1 hour before closing time and that's exactly the service I received. The sushi was not fresh, very hard and just not what I expected after I saw they had 5 stars. It was a waste of $20 and I felt very sick after eating a few. The fish is not fresh and has a foul odor. I will not order from here again.
