I wanted to get LASIK done for a few years but I have always been to nervous to even go in for the consultation. I finally met with Rebecca and she immediatly put me to ease, especially to know the procedure only will take less than two minutes per eye. I went to get a second consult at LASIK of Nevada.I didn't feel as comfortable plus I waited in the waiting room for quite a while. I think it was funny to fill out the papaerwork and they are trying to promote collagen injections among other things. Anyways I had my surgery done a couple weeks ago and I couldn't be happier!!! Dr Wellish did the actual surgery and he makes sure you feel very comfortable before he will even take you to the operating room. He talks you through the whole thing and let's you know everything that's happening. Some places may tell you he is retired and he will not perform the surgery but he does. I thank everyone at Wellish, Dr Wellish, Dr. McCandless, Rebecca, and the very friendly office staff. :)
