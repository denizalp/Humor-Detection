At nearly 40 bucks a head for dinner, you would hope that the Buffet at Bellagio delivers. Even during the slower periods of the day, there's always a line coming out of the entrance. The food here must be good right? I mean, it's a luxury hotel casino for crying out loud! Is it any good at all? \n\nYes. Yes it is.\n\nAlthough the wait may be a little lengthy for even the most patient of patrons, I must say that the Buffat at Bellagio did do it's fair service. First and foremost, there's plenty to choose from. Although it seems like seafood is the focus here, there are items such as freshly carved meats and sides for the taking, as well as a fairly decent array of Italian dishes. Going back to the seafood, however, it was definitely up to par for being a buffet. \n\nMost places, when they do seafood, it's usually budget-level offerings such as cod, and maybe salmon or catfish. Not here. The Snow crab legs were absolutely divine. There probably wasn't a plate in the entire restaurant that didn't have crab legs on it. The sushi tasted surprisingly clean and fresh, which again, I must say is a little odd for buffet-style cuisine!\n\nPrime rib? Perfect. It was a perfect medium-rare and didn't even need au jus to enhance the flavor. Very good stuff. \n\nMy only complaint, is that the service is a tad rough. I understand it's busy, but something more than 2 visits to my table for refills on beverages needs to be addressed. That's the only thing that's holding me back from giving the Buffet at Bellagio a full 5-star rating.
