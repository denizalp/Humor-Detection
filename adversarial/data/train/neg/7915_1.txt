I want to start out by saying that the office staff is very friendly and helpful! I went to Carmen today for IPL treatment and she did a wonderful job! I have had probably twenty something treatments so I have been doing this for a long time. I want you to know that this office does want you to get a good result after one treatment. Yes.... it can take around 5 treatments back to back if you have a lot of damage and want the best result possible but you should see a difference after  just one treatment. Some places will tell you that you will not see an improvement after one treatment and that you must have a lot of treatments,,,, but the truth is you should see improvement after one treatment.  \nThis is why I would recommend North Scottsdale Laser because they deep down want you to get a good result and want you to continue to give them your business. You will receive a good result after your treatment and continue to come back later for  more treatments! If you are nervous to have this done you will be good hands with Carmen. I WILL DEFINITELY be back!
