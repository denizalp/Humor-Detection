O&I at the Waterfront is a very nice restaurant. Their patio has recently even refurbished and is a great place to hang when the weather is nice. The place is very near Scottsdale Fashion Square so the atmosphere is a bit more upscale, but still approachable- I've been here in jeans & a t shirt many times! It's one of my top 5 fav places for weekend brunch - they have $5 mimosas!! And I like that you get to pick your ratios of champagne to OJ as they do them table-side! The restaurant is very large and get a bit noisy at peak times but is a cool vibe! Also good for large crowds and groups dining!
