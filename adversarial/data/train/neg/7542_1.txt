I've seen Guy Fieri on TV before so I was pretty excited to try out some of the food. I had high expectations and they were pretty much met.\n\nSince we had no reservations, it took a little while to get seated but it wasn't a long wait at all. We were given a great seat with an amazing view.\n\nI opted to go for one of their signature cocktails that they had on the menu and it was delightful and really refreshing. \n\nThe trash can nachos were amazing and so were the fries! It was really delicious. My high expectations were met with great food. My friend ordered the bacon Mac and cheese and he seemed to enjoy it. \n\nI wanted to try some dessert but my stomach just didn't have the room for it. I was so full off of the appetizers and entrees that there was no way I could finish off the dessert. I also had some cocktails too!\n\nThe service was pretty good. The servers were really friendly and knowledgeable when it came to the menu. The drinks were refilled almost instantly!
