Ain't what they used to be. While living in San Jose several of my colleagues and I would go to the Peppermill on Friday's for the clam chowder and a sandwich. Today, while passing through Las Vegas we stopped at the Peppermill on the Strip. It was quite noisy and the food did not live up to what I remember. OK, but not great. Fast service.
