We stopped in here in the afternoon before heading over to the TalkingStick area to see a concert. What a waste! Service was extremely slow, we asked several times for information on happy hour and finally had to look it up on our phones. People were being served before us, UGH! Sad part was that it wasn't busy, we were one of 3 tables on the patio. The interior had nothing to offer as far as decor.  Drinks took forever! We were trying to avoid a chain establishment and crowds of people and we found it here but the lack of everything will keep us from returning.
