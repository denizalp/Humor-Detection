PROS\nConsidering the only other option is the Champaign Bark District (it's in the middle of no where, without trees, or a dog bath station, and it doesn't seem like anyone goes there regularly--granted, I haven't been there in months), I always choose this dogpark since it's a quick hop on 74 and it's a guaranteed good time for my dog.\n\nThere are usually other dogs to play with, usually well-behaved. I can't recall ever witnessing a dogfight in the 1+ years I came here, and I've gone at varying times, multiple times a week. There are some obnoxious, less well-trained dogs but I've seen worse.\n\nThe grove of trees in the center provide decent shade for dogs and humans alike, and the benches by the trees are a good idea on hot days.\n\nIt's a huge space (10 acres) so even at its busiest, there's still plenty of sections of the park for the dogs to play.\n\nThere is a human\/dog water fountain on the big dog side and a spigot on the small dog side. There is also a dog bath station (put a carabiner on your dog's leash for easy hook-up to the fence).\n\nCONS\nHumans who bring treats or people food (obviously dogs are going to jump on you and annoy you if they know there's food around--also, you don't know if there are food-aggressive dogs around and you may unintentionally start a fight).\n\nHumans who stand around (or walk the perimeter) and socialize instead of supervising their dogs and picking up after them. Also, if your dog isn't well-socialized, don't stick them in the big\/active dog area and get upset at the other dog\/dog owner if your dog can't handle it.\n\nIt can get pretty buggy in the summertime during the evenings. Don't forget to bring bug spray.\n\nSmall dog side is way too small. Big dog side is 9 or 10 acres and small dog side is maybe an acre? In other dogparks I've been to, there has always been a size difference but not as blatant as this.\n\nHumans are technically supposed to register their dogs to the park district (and pay a fee). I moved to AZ and the dogparks are free. I didn't mind paying the fee because I understand it's for maintenance, but in that case, it should be enforced. I went to this dogpark from March 2009-July 2010 and have never seen park personnel (despite what the website says) and I would guess that the vast majority of the dogs that go here don't have the park tags.\n\nNEUTRAL\nMudpits are common. Luckily there is a dog bath station. Don't forget to bring towels.\n\nI don't advise bringing children (especially younger than 10) to dogparks. You don't know if a dog who goes to the DOG PARK is kid-friendly. It wasn't a big issue when I went here which is why it's under the neutral category.\n\nhttp:\/\/www.dogstardaily.com\/free-downloads - Before AND After You Get Your Puppy by Ian Dunbar in pdf format\nhttp:\/\/dogsintraining.livejournal.com\/ - online forum focusing on progressive reinforcement dog training\nhttp:\/\/www.youtube.com\/user\/kikopup?blend=1&ob=5 - videos on progressive reinforcement dog training\nhttp:\/\/www.lifescript.com\/life\/family\/pets\/dog_park_danger.aspx - some dangers that can be found at dogparks
