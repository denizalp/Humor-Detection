Great place for glass of wine and some apps.  We met some friends here early as it does get crowded.  We order some apps and a bottle of wine.  The food was very good, flat bread pizza, prime rib sliders, anti-pasto board just great.  Good selection of wine, if you are not a wine drinker there are a handful of beers and a couple of mix drink selections.  (This is a wine bar after all).  The service was very friendly and prompt.  We will be back.\n\nAt about 7p the noise level does increase, so it does become a bit of a challenge to have a friendly conversation with your party.  The prices were not bad at all.
