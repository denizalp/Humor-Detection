Trying to get into the club was a nightmare! I went with 3 other girls and we were on a guestlist. We made sure we were in line before midnight. Around 11:30 we were still waiting in line and they told us it wasn't free anymore and it was 35.00 a head. Chris and Ryan were bouncers in charge of the lines and letting so many female groups ahead of us when we had to wait forever! I asked Chris why he wasn't letting our line in and he just ignored me and let others go ahead. The bouncers were discussing with each other which groups should go in and which ones should wait. That is very unacceptable. There was a thin, light skinned female, with shoulder length light brown hair with layers holding a clipboard walking around. I asked if she worked there. She said yes. So I complained to her about the situation and she replied, \"It's a club what do you expect!\", and she rolled her eyes and walked away. I didn't get her name but she was very rude and extremely unprofessional!!!! She needs to be trained on her people skills because she does not work well under pressure and chaos. That whole experience ruined my night and if it wasn't for it being my friend's birthday I would have left. Management please be aware of these employees and roll the surveillance camera's from friday May 25th around 11 to midnight and observe your staff. The club itself is amazing but the chaos and disorganization in the lines it is unprofessional.
