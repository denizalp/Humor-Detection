Had a fab follow up experience here. So much so I referred 6 people there immediately following my appointment.\n\nKristy helped me with my frame & lens selection. She was beyond helpful & quite knowledgeable. What I appreciated most was how patient she was with me: indecisive as hell & couldn't keep the financials straight.  She spent a lot of time helping me choose new frames.  We went through several pairs. I appreciated her opinion on what looked good & what didn't. She answered all my questions & helped me stay within my budget, which was not easy to do since I settled on a pricey pair of Tom Fords. No pressure to buy things I didn't want or need.  I was in recently to order prescription Oakley lenses & again she was beyond helpful & made suggestions based upon my specific needs & preferences. What I loved hearing was that I didn't need to turn over my current (Oakley) sunglasses-she took down the model number in order for Oakley to cut my lenses & will ship them to her; upon arrival I'll come in & she'll pop out the current lenses & \"install\" the new ones. How fab is that??  I'll return soon for yet another pair of glasses AND readers. \n\nDr Halling was amazing. I love her. She was hysterical but very focused & thorough during my exam.  She brought some alarming issues to my attention about my eye health (premature cataracts by about 15-20 years) & put my mind at ease. She gave me a sample of eye drops that have worked wonders with my eye allergies...first time anyone has taken me seriously on this issue. Relief!!\n\nThey have a nice selection of frames. Their Ray Ban offerings aren't great. Yes I could go to another Optic Gallery location & choose something there; unfortunately, their larger store in Boca Park doesn't take my insurance plan (Spectera) so I don't know how that would benefit me.  1\/2 down to get the order started, the rest due at the time of pick up. They really make it easy to help you pay for new glasses!!
