I've had the pleasure of using Janet now for about 3 years and am so thankful she's come into my life.  Now this statement may sound a little dramatic but when you use a seamstress as often as I do, partnering up with one like Janet feels like a miracle.\n\nIt's not just the quality of her very reasonably priced work that makes me drive 20 mins (one way) but also her personality.  She's proven to be trust worthy, flexible, accommodating, incredibly friendly and a great laugh too.  I can be very particular and detailed orientated and Janet has always been able to manage that.  I trust her eye & experience and so as a result, her suggestions and opinions too.  \n\nI always feel like Janet has my best interests at heart and believe she deserves this 5 star rating!
