I booked appointment through Yelp  and decided to buy a series of blow outs. Made appointment at salon for 2 weeks later. I show up and front can't figure out what happened to my appointment. Had charity event that same evening. What is the use of a blow out place if they can't get their act together for appointments. Asked for refund for the credit I have. Front workers said they couldn't and I have to email owner. The email address was wrong and I called twice and got 2 different email address which was all incorrect. Bad business on Tatum and Shea.
