Came here for lunch with great friends.  We were here early so we were able to snag a seat.  They had nice banquet seating with cute colour scheme in the basement.  We were nice and comfy.  The burgers were good. I had the Hawaii burger, which had a cunning mixture of blue cheese and caramelized nuts.  It worked! Who knew?  I also had it with a side of sweet potato fries.  Yummy and tender patty, which works with the thickness of the burger overall.  My friends had the salads and they really enjoyed it as well.  Personally I think it is a sin to go to a burger place and order a salad but at least they have delish options.  \n\nWhen I am in Montreal and craving for burger this will be my go to place.  Close to downtown core and easily accessible.
