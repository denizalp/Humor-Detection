Amazing food. Great selection of beers. Nice and cozy. Unfortunately all of these couldn't compensate for the fact that I was served by a waitress who was clearly on meth or just not right in the head. Extremely rude when my friend asked for suggestions about some beers. She scoffed and told her to \"just read the menu\" as she will find the descriptions there. My friend was perfectly polite even though she took some time to ask questions (she doesn't know much about beer and because they had such a great selection she wanted to try their best ones). \n\nI understand how stressful it can be for a waitress during a busy night however her behaviour was 100% unacceptable. She was extremely fidgety the whole time and cut us off abruptly in the middle of asking questions. Her body language was just...strange. I felt like she might explode if we asked her for anything at all. She stopped coming to our table too after the food came by so I resorted to asking another waitress for help when i wanted some napkins. I believer the waitress' name was Cassandra and I don't care if she loses her job because of this review because she shouldn't be allowed to interact with human beings.
