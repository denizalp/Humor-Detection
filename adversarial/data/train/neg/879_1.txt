Recently changed locations in the same shopping center to a much larger pad. Much better than the smaller pad. They have lots of nice yarns and generally have a good selection of Malabrigo, which is a fav of mine. \n\nThey also have a nice selection of fiber for spinning, although it seems they recently switched to minimum prebundled packages of fiber, which I don't like. \n\nThey also have Jacquard dyes, spinning wheels (Ashford, Louet and Kromski ) and looms.
