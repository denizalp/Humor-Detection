I was driving up Scottsdale Rd. on the way to my one guilty pleasure that I have In-and-Out, to have my once a month double double.  I looked up and saw the 5 guys sign, made a quick turn, and decided to go there instead after hearing how great this place was from my East Coast friends. I Had the regular burger (two patty's) and my wife had the small burger (1 patty) we split a large order of Cajun fries (huge portion) and each had a soda.  Set us back about $20.  Loved the variety of toppings we could put our burgers, loved the free peanuts, loved the variety of diet drinks from the soda machine (ordering a diet drink at place like this is a little twisted when you think about it) although they had run out of a couple of the varieties.  Did not like or dislike the Cajun fries after a few I had had enough. Only thing I did not like is the price.  If I had gone to In-and-Out I would have had a meal I would have enjoyed just as much but would have ended up with about $8 more in my pocket which is why Five Guys will not replace In-Ad-Out as my once a month guilty pleasure.
