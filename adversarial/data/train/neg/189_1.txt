I just wanted to say a big thank you to everyone at the Bridal Boutique of Arizona especially Helen who was absolutely amazing. My sister had gone to a few different bridal shops and was getting very disillusioned with the whole idea of having to find a dress. I found this boutique online and flew out to Phoenix to meet with my sister and try and help her find a dress. Helen made the whole process so effortless and fun. She asked the right questions and really listens to what my sister liked and didn't like. She gave some great ideas. And my sister is super happy with her dress and the customization available. The customer service was absolutely amazing they did a great job of making her feel catered to. \nI would highly recommend this boutique to anyone looking for a wedding dress especially if you're a picky bride. \nAnd I can't forget to mention the store is absolutely adorable it's very rustic shabby chic with elegant bling they even have a real old-fashioned vault!
