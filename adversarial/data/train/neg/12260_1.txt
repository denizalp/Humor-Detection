Not knowing where to eat since Lotus of Siam was closed we immediately went to Yelp to look for a place.  After lots of going back and forth Island Malay won out and it was well worth it.  The waitress didn't look chinese but spoke cantonese which was a plus.\n\nGood:\nRoti Canai - in the past i've had this served with a thicker curry but it was still good\nchar kway teow - a flat noodle which was good\nLaksa  - first time having it so I dont have much to compare to but it was good.\nKang Kung Veggies\n\nJust okay:\nBeef Rendang - beef was tender but wanted more developed flavors
