I just moved here from San Francisco and i wanted to pick up a quick salad and pizza to have as i relaxed and got settled in. I ordered a chicken fajita salad , and a cheesesteak which by far exceeded my expectations!! Its was so delicious!!!! What will make me come back to this location is their friendly management, especially Mike!! Thank you for a good experience .
