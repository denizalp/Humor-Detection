You come to fuel pizza for:\n\n- LOCATION - prime downtown location for post event glory\n- ambiance - has this cool slightly retro feel to it\n- Dependably decent pizza (I have no illusions this isn't New York)...\nBUT...\nfor 3.50 a slice for cheese - I would expect NYC quality pizza... \n\nStaff was friendly and helpful, but then again, it wasn't busy when I visited.
