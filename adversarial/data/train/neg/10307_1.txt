I will never shop at a Jared again! I made a purchase at the store Saturday night and an associate offered to clean my jewelry. 3 out of my 4 rings lost diamonds out of them. One I have had a month, 2nd one since after Valentine's day, and the 3rd since Christmas. There is no reason this should have happened. Yes, they are replacing the diamonds, but they are doing nothing to compensate the fact that I had to drive 3hrs round trip to have this resolved. I have spent thousands of dollars in this store and so has my stepdad. Never again will I deal with this company!
