It's been a few decades since I had real souvlaki in Greece, but I remember with not a small amount of nostalgia how the tiny cuts of meat melted in my mouth, the fresh and bold seasoning, the guy playing the guitar in my face waiting for me to toss him some Drachmas ...\n\nThe Souvlaki Hut is in a small-ish space nestled next to a Subway and across from a respectable Thai restaurant.  It is decked out with a fast food ambiance that is only half accurate: yes they have gyros and other American takes on Greek, but the Souvlaki is where they shine, it takes several minutes to prepare, and it is why I'd like to see a more elegant restaurant come out in a remodel.\n\nThe cuts of meat in the souvlaki are large, and seem to be quality meat although I did come across some tough parts.  The seasoning was about what I expected.  All the tasty sides they include are fun also; the Greek-style fries (sprinkled with finely crumbled feta) were fun, the rice and potato were a bit more authentic.  Check out the side salad: there is more going on under there than meets the eye.  And the glazed bananas were of course nice.\n\nI came here twice, on the second visit correcting my first mistake and ordering the REGULAR sized lamb souvlaki dinner, and both times went away fat and happy.
