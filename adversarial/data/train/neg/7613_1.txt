Honestly love this little place. It's exactly what you would expect but more. The service was so genuine! The food was actually decent! Expect the hash browns are odd. There not diced there just shaped similar to McDonald's. I wish they had different ones. Anyways\nWent here for breakfast New Year's Day. Small place with only about 4-5 booths and the bar area. We were seated at the bar and told we would be in a booth soon. We were! Since the place is so small it gets cold when people come and go but the server was all over it shutting the door every time it opened! \nI would 100% go back for breakfast. Cheap, delicious and convenient!!\n\n3.8
