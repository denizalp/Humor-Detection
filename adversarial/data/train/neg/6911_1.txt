Took three pairs of shoes in to be repaired. Received excellent service at a very reasonable rate, and the shoes were ready a week later... much prompter than other places I've gone to. The proprietor was very pleasant as well, and showed me an option for an insole replacement to be sure I was okay with the color. I highly recommend this business!
