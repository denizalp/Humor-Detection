very respectable and fresh buffet. great selection of foods, and most of them were excellent. had delicious ravioli, pork sticky buns, crab, and more. the sushi was good but nothing to rave about, but they had a delicious ahi tuna poke that made up for any lack in the department. the buffet is on the expensive side, about $36\/person, and the wait when we went around 6pm on a saturday night was about an hour and a half, but it was worth the wait. word of advice: leave yourself some time to nap after the buffet before you go out!
