I am visiting my friends in Toronto and we wanted to find a cute place that is near there homes so we didn't have to walk far. Over Easy was just right down the way so we chose there. Being brunch time on a Saturday we thought it may be incredibly busy and they don't take reservations on the weekends, but to our surprise we were seated quite quickly and waited on right away. Our waitress was a wonderful women by the name of Bess who had a bedazzled name plate and called us sweet names like darling and dear; she was wonderful. \n\nThe atmosphere was very cozy and welcoming although it was not the largest of restaurants and the isles were narrow making it challenging if someone was coming in the opposite direction to get by. \n\nI can't eat eggs so I was worried that I wouldn't actually be able to have anything other than coffee when I arrived but they had many other things on the menu such as pancakes and waffles. Our food came reasonably quickly and tasted great! \n\nI will say that I was frustrated that they did not sell just regular orange juice which i wanted with my meal and i had to pay $4.50 for a small glass of fresh squeezed orange juice. Although it tasted great, it was over priced. \n\nOverall it was a nice experience and when I visit Toronto again and I would considered the possibility of visiting Over Easy again.
