I've been a patient here for a few years. Always been happy. Unfortunately some policy change is putting people at risk. I called today because I have a bad cough and am having trouble breathing. She said she can't get me in for over a week because I'll need a yearly physical before they can see me for my cough. She said its policy to not help anyone with any medical issues until they have had the yearly physical. I let her know I have never received notice of that or that I was in need of one. She said it is the patients responsibility to remember to schedule it not hers. And if I'm worried about my cough I can go to urgent care. So my established doctor is refusing to see me about trouble breathing because I haven't had a yearly physical. I called a nearby doctor that I have never been to and they are seeing me in 3 hours. I will never go back to skyline and I will transfer my care. What an absurd policy that puts the health of people at risk. What a huge sign that they don't care about people at all. Just maximizing the amount of appointments they can get you in for. If you are a current patient make sure to track your yearly physical and set it up so his doesn't happen to you.
