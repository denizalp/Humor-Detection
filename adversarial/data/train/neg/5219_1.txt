Went to get a new battery for my car...got a 5 year warranty and the deal is I have a 2010 infinity g37 and it's a real pain in the ads to put in the battery. Not for the guys over at auto zone. Very helpful guy named Jordan helped install it for me. This is my third battery from there and always great service...friendly and they know everything.
