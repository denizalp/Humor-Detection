Once again, the staff know me by name & always greet me with a smile so i feel welcomed every-time! Another upgrade upon check-in & no questions asked when i changed my reservation to leave one day early. The Sheraton is a gem in downtown-close to all the summer festivals & too many restaurants & shopping to name! Whether its pleasure or business -I prefer this Starwood Property!
