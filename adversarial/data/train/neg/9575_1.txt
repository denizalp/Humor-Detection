I've been meaning to try Le Vin Papillon for a while now, but the fact that they don't accept reservations made me keep putting it off, because I hate to wait in line for a table. One day we decided to give it a try and were super lucky to find a table available right away. Their menu is all made of small plates, which I find great, because you get to taste several different dishes. And in a place as delicious as Le Vin Papillon, it's just perfect to get to try as many dishes as you can. One was better than the other.... And the cheese plate was the grand finale, for sure. It comes with maple buttered toast, nuts and a delicious cookie that match perfectly the cheese.
