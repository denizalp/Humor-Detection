I am a Vegas clubbing veteran.  I'd rather not disclose my age, but I will say I was partying in this space back when it was Baby's.  So, feeling nostalgic, I wanted to party here for my fabulous **th birthday.  Body English never disappoints.  I'm so glad that it reopened.  As others have stated, it's not the \"over the top\" production like XS or Marquee, but when you get \"over\" a certain age, that's just no longer the scene for you and it's just about having a good time, not being \"seen.\"  I can't begin to tell you how well we were treated.  My friend had a headache and needed to grab some Tylenol at the gift shop.  Our security guard escorted her to the gift shop and back so she would not have any issues getting back in.  We were tipping everyone left and right (ok, we may have been really drunk, but those people deserved every dollar).  My career success is based on customer service and professionalism, so whoever is training this staff is doing it right.  Not one person in that place was rude - from our host at the door (that's you Handsome Oliver), to the gentleman checking IDs, to our table hosts, to our security guard.  Every staff member had a smile on their face the entire night.  And talk about attentive!  My clubbing days are probably numbered, but if I never go to another club again, I'm glad my last experience was at Body English.  I would have paid DOUBLE based on the service alone.  Oh, and we were on the dance floor all night long - so kudos to the DJ too.
