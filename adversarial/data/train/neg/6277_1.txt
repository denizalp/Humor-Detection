Finally after the long wait...Markham VIP opens its doors...One of the most impressive establishments in a very long time in Markham (excluding pan am) \n\nThis place is sooo huge you can get lost.. it is still under some minor renovations as I think probably alot of businesses are bidding their way into here...\n\nThis is a one stop place...from dinner to movies to drinks after the movies...All you need is to stay here...\n\nMe Va Me Express opened and it looks nicely renovated. Haven't had the chance to try it out yet but I definitely will...\n\nCha Time - need I say more? my all time favourite BBT place finally made its way to Markham...love it!!\n\nAroma Express - would you like espresso\/latte after the movies? \n\nUnderground parking is quite decent size but it can get quite packed during the weekends as this is probably one of the biggest theatres in York Region\n\nMy first choice when it comes to movies!
