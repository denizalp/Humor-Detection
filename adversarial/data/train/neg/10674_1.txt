For an egg sandwich place you get what you wait for.  The sausage egg cheese sandwich is pretty filling and juicy but if I had to wait 2 hours to get one (like at the DTLA location) I would definitely pass.  Fortunately the vegas location the wait isnt that long.  I arrived at 11am on Friday and was out of there by 1130am.
