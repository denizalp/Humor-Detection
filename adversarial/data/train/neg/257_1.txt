An exercise in stuffing ones face lol Kaya has offerings you won't find within a hundred mile radius. The Caribbean influence is ever present. On this lunch outing I chose to go with the fish tacos and popular favorite jerk wings, way too much food for one person. The wings are a hit for good reason! Good size, well seasoned, full of flavor. With so many menu options, it's tough to choose, but no matter the choice you will not leave unsatisfied
