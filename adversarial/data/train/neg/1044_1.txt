I noticed this was in Best of Phoenix for Best Japanese food. I came here during lunch and tried the spicy tuna and spicy yellowtail... No Bueno! The rice was not cooked well. My fiance tried the melon cream soda and chicken katsu curry... Pretty Decent! \n\nAfter finishing, it dawned on me that Sushi Ken was labeled best Japanese, not Best Sushi, so I'm going to have to make a trip back and confirm my rating.
