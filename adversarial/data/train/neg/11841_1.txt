I've been to Dr. Brown a few times and always had a wonderful experience.  The staff are wonderful.  They do their best to squeeze me in and I always feel at home.  \nToday I had to take my son (8yrs old) there for an emergency.  He's a new patient and they got us in right away.  During the needle process, instead of my son crying, he was laughing!  Dr. Brown made the whole procedure fun and relaxing.  Their new office is stunning and I can't say enough good things about Dr. Brown and his staff.  I highly recommend this office.
