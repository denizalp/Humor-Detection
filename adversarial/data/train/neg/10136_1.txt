This place isn't somewhere I would've noticed if I hadn't come the back way through the parking lot but it's actually really awesome! Stopped in for some lunch on a Saturday afternoon and it wasn't very busy, just looked like one person working but the burgers we ordered came out pretty decent for the price and you get a token for every dollar you spend (not sure about drinks) to play games in their arcade area. It's like a small scale dave and busters with temple run, flappy bird, skeeball, basketball, etc. It's also a full on sports bar with huge televisions. Glad we stopped in here!
