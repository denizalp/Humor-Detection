We stayed at the Ventian November, 2011 for our 13 year anniversay. It was a must-do place for us and we were finally able to swing it. The room was in the Venetian Towers and while it was a neat layout, (sunken livingroom) I wasn't at all impressed wih the furnishings for the cost. The upholstered seating was rock-hard. The pieces seemed to be a hodgepodge of styles - almost as if this was the room that got the leftovers after mate pieces had gotten broken in other rooms. I am well-aware hotel furniture sacrifices the fine-furniture status for sturdiness, but these pieces really didn't speak quality, class or sturdiness to me. One piece was literally standing on it's last leg and would have collapsed altogether if my husband hadn't gingerly touched it. We called housekeeping to let them know of the damage and it was promptly taken away. The view from the room overlooked Las Vegas Blvd AND the unattractive rooftops of the buildings between us and the road. I prefer the view from the Bellagio. \n\nThat being said, having a television in the LR and one in the BR portion of the room was nice for when you were tired of sitting on a slab and wanted to watch from the comfort of the bed. And, needing a nice hot soak after a long day of walking around, it was also nice having a small tv in the bathroom as well. The bathroom is gorgeous and had a nice vanity so I could sit and apply makeup and do my hair while my husband used the mirror over the sink. The hallways and public areas were sumptuous and what I would have thought the room would be as well. The staff was efficient and friendly. The vendors were varied and interesting. The eating establishments were varied, interesting and for the most part very good. For the first time, we stayed totally within the Venetian\/Pallazio campus for EVERYTHING. That was a nice treat. \n\nOverall, we enjoyed our stay. I was just disappointed with the view, the decor and the comfort of the room.
