We came here to have a great time since it was my gf 21st birthday. It was our first time here and it looked like a very welcoming place. It started off good and later turned into a disaster. Food was brought out wrong and scattered. We had 2 other guest whose food came out after everybody was done eating. The server was very friendly. But very disorganized. I expected so much more especially since it's a special day. We are really disappointed in the way we were served and probably will take our celebrations elsewhere next time.
