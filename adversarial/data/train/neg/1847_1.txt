Certain things catch your attention. In this case, I ordered the Chili, which arrived in an appetizing bowl until I hit the bottom a scant 2 cm deep. This is not a bowl, it's a deep desert plate!  Essentially, a $4 Tim Hortons Chili would have filled the whole $10 Grey Goat bowl. A little obvious, huh?\n\nThe Chili was covered in a generous layer of shredded cheese, and accompanied by 2 small slices of garlic toast. I like Timmy's Chili better. Yeah, I like Wendy's better too. \n\nMy other choice was going to be the Corned Beef sandwich, but my lunch guest chose that one. Glad I didn't. The beef looked fairly dry and unremarkable. \n\nIt's a bar.  Don't expect anything beyond bar fare.
