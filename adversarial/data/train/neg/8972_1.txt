I absolutely love this salon! I came in for a color correction due to a mishap in a previous salon and from the moment I called to make my appointment the receptionist who was so kind already made me feel so confident that they would fix and make my hair perfect. I came in for my appointment on a busy Saturday afternoon and Oscar my hair stylist greeted me and asked me for a few pictures of what I wanted, I showed him my pictures and he made sure I would get the results I showed him. He worked on my hair for about 3-ish hours and my first session was absolutely beautiful! I was completely satisfied and amazed that it looked that good for my first session. (Mind my hair is naturally black and I was going completely ashy blonde.) Oscar later told me he needed me for a second session cause he wanted to fix some of the brassy parts that were hidden in the inside of my hair. The fact that he knew those parts were there but were not visible to me showed he truly cared and took pride of his art. Later that week I went in for my second session, I was extremely happy with the outcome of my hair. Best results I've had in Las Vegas. I am the kind of girl who gets very bored of my hair color so I am constantly changing it and I've always been floating around salon to salon changing it up, but I am definitely coming back for my touch ups and maintenance! Oscar is definitely the man!
