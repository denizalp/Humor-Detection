I should have kept my reservation at the other hotel, but my friends event coordinator told me they had rooms blocked here, so I booked. \nIt is a fine place to stay, but definitely needs improvements. \nPros:\n-Nicely done property, well kept gardens and grounds\n-Nice staff, pleasant\n-Kind of funny decor, like a wacky haunted house. Nothing wrong with it, it is pleasant enough\n-Plenty of parking\n-Spacious gym with lots of options\n-7 minute drive to town\n\n\n\nCons: \n-The guy with the leafblower comes blasting by at 9am. I'm from CA so it was 6am for me and it's a terrible sound to wake up to. They should do this kind of loud stuff in the afternoon\n-No bellboy to help with bags\n-Continental bkfst, but with mediocre items and highly processed foods: yogurt full of sugar, Kroger-type croissants (you can smell the chemicals in them), half and half in the plastic cups, cereals full of sugar. I had some \"homemade granola\", but I question if it were really homemade b\/c it too, tasted like chemicals. I'd expect something a bit more classy and better quality for 180\/night. I just ate the fruit & went to town to find bkfst. \n- The toiletries smell like Pine Sol\n-No bathtub in our room\n-The TV reception is very poor. Kept going out and static - We really coudln't watch a channel for more than 10 mins without it going on the fritz\n- They want you to pay for the gym per day. I find this insulting and tacky. I think it's 7 or 8 bucks a day. \n\nOverall, it is fine if you're in a pinch. Not that I go to Cleveland very often ever, but I would choose not to stay here again, only because it really needs some updating and attention to details. If they improved just a few things, it woudl make all the difference. It is too expensive a price point for what you get.
