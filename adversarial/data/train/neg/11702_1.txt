We had wanted to try Onda last December when we were in Vegas only to find out it was closed to renovations.  We were finally able to get there this trip and it was quite good.\n\nWe were seated in a booth in the main dining room which is done in soft gold tones with low lighting.   It is very romantic and homey, as if you are dining at a family restaurant in Little Italy, albeit an upscale one.  (It is the exact opposite of N9NE...see N9NE review.) The tomato, garlic and olive oil they give you with your bread was fantastic and the bread was very fresh and fluffy.  My husband and I split the caprese salad as an appetizer, which I would highly suggest...they split it in half for us and it was the perfect size.  (And the mozzarella was very good.)  For an entree I had the capellini with scallops which were very good, well cooked, and in a generous serving.  The pasta was well cooked and they used a good amount of oil on it, not too much that it made it slippery and hard to eat but enough to give it flavor.  My friend ordered the fettuccine alfredo which he said was out of this world.\n\nTucked away in the back of the Mirage, Onda proved to be a great dining experience.
