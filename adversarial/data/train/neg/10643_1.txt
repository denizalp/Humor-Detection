On the first visit, I was the fourth car in line and waited 30 minutes for my food. Decided to give the place one more try. Unbelievably, I was the third car in line and waited 35 minutes! I actually got out of the car and went to the front window. I said I was still the second car in line and have been waiting over 30 minutes. The first two females just looked at me then two men stood there and said nothing. Finally a female comes and I tell her my concern. She says sorry for the wait, the cook had to leave for a little while because the owner called in an order? I went to my car thinking never again will I come to this place.
