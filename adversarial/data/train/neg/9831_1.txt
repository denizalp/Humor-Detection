Lived up to it's reputation on Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives.  So many choices of meats and they'll let you sample as many as you'd like.  Served in a shiny aluminum take out dish and best served right into your belly!\n\nLots of food for like $8 or something ridiculous.  Great for a quick bite to eat.
