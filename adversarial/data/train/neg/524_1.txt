Wait was 1.5 hours to get table, then another 30 minutes for food to arrive.  Food was alright as one can't go wrong with hamburgers.  Atmosphere was amazing.  Price is high for the quality of the food but it's the atmosphere that you are paying for.  It's a one-time experience to say \"Yes, we've been there!\" and nothing more.
