We used to live right around the corner from this delicious Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives spot, and I'm so sad to now live 30 minutes away. The pancakes are definitely the best item at this dive - the chocolate chip and pumpkin are to die for! Service is also pretty quick for a location that has such a cramped dining room and tiny kitchen space. Plan to wait a bit (maybe 30 minutes or so) for a table on Saturday mornings!
