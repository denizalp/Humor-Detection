Review on the Pharmacy Department\n\nCame to Walmart to fill a prescription for my son who had broken out in hives during the weekend. \n\nWe got to Walmart before 8 AM and noticed the pharmacy wasn't open yet. We ran into the Pharmacist and she saw my son covered in hives. She told us the cashier won't be there until 9 AM and asked us to come back then. We left and came back at 9 AM. When we checked in at the drop off window the pharmacy tech told us the order has already been filled and is ready for pick up! \n\nThe pharmacy staff went above & beyond for us to ease my sons wait for his medication. The pharmacist saw how miserable my son was with his hives and she knew the medication would help. We're very appreciative to her & the staff for caring and filling his order so quickly! He is now feeling a lot better and less itchy with his extra strength meds for his hives.
