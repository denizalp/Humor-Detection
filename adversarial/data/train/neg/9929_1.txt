If you're going down to a game DO NOT go here.  They are not equipped to handle the mass of people that come here.  The food was fine but the service was HORRIBLE !!!!  We waited 45 minutes for our food and once it came my son ordered wings and needed more napkins and the server never brought them.  There are plenty of other choices right around there with similar food that have better service.
