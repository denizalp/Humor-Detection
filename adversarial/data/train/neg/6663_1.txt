I had never heard of Border Grill, but when family that we were in Vegas with suggested heading there for their tapas style all you can eat brunch on a Saturday morning I was in. When they say all you can eat.. they mean it! We were there for about 3 and a half hours enjoying their delicious offerings plus $8 bottomless mimosas. We sat outside near the pool since the weather was perfect and really enjoyed our brunch. \n\nBecause there were more than 5 of us they suggested ordering family style so the food would come out a little more quickly so we did and it worked out quite well. After being seated were were automatically brought out some tasty guava empanadas and fresh fruit to much on while we decided on our mimosa flavors (did I mention there were 7 flavors to choose from??) and our first few menu items. We ended up trying 11 of their 22 dishes and some of the favorites were the Shrimp and Grits, Breakfast Fries and Bread Pudding French toast. Almost every dish was in some way super decedent and rich and it worked out perfectly to just have a few bites and move on to the next dish.\n\nOur waitress, Rachel, was amazing. She was super helpful with suggestions and answered any questions that we had. She also amazingly kept up with our mimosa and food requests as well as refreshing our plates, silver wear and water glasses when needed. She also never got tired of us asking her to repeat the mimosa flavors (maybe listing them on the menu would be a good idea).\n\nGreat experience and I would definitely choose this over a buffet any day!
