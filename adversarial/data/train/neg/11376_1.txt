Great lunch today with my son. Haven't been here in about 10 years. I had the sesame chicken and as soon as it was set on the table I was glad I stepped back in. For under $7 I got soup, fried rice, sesame chicken, a spring roll and a crab puff. And they were all really good. The service was quick and efficient. The server was very polite and kind. The food was tasty and fresh. Overall a great experience in the under $10 area.
