I got my hair cut today by Ciao. He's really good. I love my hair. He listens to you properly and gives you the exact haircut you ask for. Not only this, he's really good at explaining things too. He gave me tips and suggestions on how to volumize or style the type of hair\/haircut I have. I aboauletly loved getting a haircut by him and I would definitely get my hair cut and hair color by ciao again.  Worth every penny spent!
