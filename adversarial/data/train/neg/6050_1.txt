this was across my workplace when i was in az. me and my co workers always ending up going to this place at least once a week because you just can't go wrong. my favorite is the jalapeno pizza which i always partner up with a side salad and an ice tea. finding a table can sometimes be a pain during lunchtime, but hey who can't blame them. this place is just that good. don't forget to get garlic knots on the side too if you feel like splurging on the calories, haha.
