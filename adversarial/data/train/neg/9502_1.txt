Everything was perfect at lunch today. The food, service & ambiance is spot-on! \n\nWe enjoyed the  Mediterranean Salad. I had a perfectly prepared piece of Salmon that was a very generous portion; my friend asked for 1\/2 chicken 1\/2 lamb and we devoured every bite we could. \n\nTheir bread is delicious along with the tasty basil dipping sauce as long as you don't  mind a hefty portion of olive oil.
