The wait wasn't too bad on Christmas Day, the food was decent but the customer service was lacking. We requested a few items and the waiters said they will check on it and never came back with any of the dishes. My friend got fed up and we were all hungry that he had to individually chase down each cart to get what he wanted. We requested for a certain congee and the waiters like kitchens closed yet the other waiters around us were still taking kitchen orders. When we flagged down another waiter we were able to order without any problems. The first waiter told us they didn't have that congee and then we hear the workers who are about to eat lunch say to each other \"oh there's blah blah congee do u want\" my whole table turned around and was like wth? If you don't mind decent dimsum with hit or miss service by all means come here
