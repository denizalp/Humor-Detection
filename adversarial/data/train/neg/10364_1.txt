I'm a super fan!  Loved everything about this place (well almost, they didn't have the server's retro t-shirts for sale).  We were like kids in a candy store entering this arena.  They have a great list of beers, a kitchen with visiting chefs each month, indoor and outdoor floor shuffleboard, tabletop shuffleboard, and the locker room theme all the way to the restrooms.  We ended up playing tabletop shuffleboard since it had the shortest wait.  Playing 1.5 hrs flew by we were having so much fun.  I would be a regular if I didn't live 40 minutes away.
