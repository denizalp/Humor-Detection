While I like using their self wash station for my dog, I will not take him there to be groomed again.  They charged me $10 more than I had been quoted on the phone, his nails didn't look trimmed, and they didn't do a great job of brushing him.  I will be looking for a more experienced groomer next time he is blowing his coat.
