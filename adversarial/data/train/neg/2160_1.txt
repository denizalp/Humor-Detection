The best hotel in Vegas so far. Everything about this hotel is a 5 star.\nI stayed at the corner suite and holy shit, what a view!! The suite came with a spacious living room, seprate bedroom and a spacious bathroom. All three rooms came with flat screen tv's. \nService was good and parking was not far from the hotel.
