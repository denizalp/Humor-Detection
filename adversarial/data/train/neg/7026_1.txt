I found Biaggio's off of yelp and had lunch here after taking my moms dog to the vet the other day. The reviews and ratings just do not do proper justice for this place. First, the food was great, and the lunch special was cheap too! Definitely get the garlic knots, but above the food I want to mention the service. I saw more compassion in my twenty minuet lunch than I did the better part of this year. The gentlemen that worked there was so friendly and a great server, but more so just a kind person. A man came in who was having trouble with his motor functions, the man who worked there helped him walk over to his table, returned the change to this patrons pocket when he couldn't and just went so far beyond what was required of his job. That made my day more so than the food. If you don't give this place a shot, you're the one missing out in more ways than one.
