Pick of the litter is fantastic.  I held an initial interview with them when I brought my new puppy home.  They have been with me every day since.  Lisa and Marylse are both great.  Samson loved them both the minute he met them.\n\nThe offer flexible visit schedules, I started with twice a day(1\/2 hr) for my new puppies, and moved to once a day full hour as he grew.  Beyond her natural love of pets, she is very professional.  \n\nIn addition to walking services, I had Lisa stay at my home with my cat and dog while I was on vacation.  My pets and home were both very well cared for.  I received daily text on status of how my pets were doing and photos, which was  huge relief for me.\n\nI unfortunately am moving from the area and will miss her, she has become a part of my pets family, they love her and get excited every time she comes.  We will all miss her.\n\nI would highly recommend her to anyone who loves their pet and wants a professional pet lover to help with their loving and care.  She is a tough bill to follow and will be very hard for me to replace in the east.
