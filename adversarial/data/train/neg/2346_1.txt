We happened upon this place by just asking Google for breakfast in our area, and I'm glad we tried it out. My mom is very picky about her breakfast, and they are one of the few places to get it right. My waffle with peanut butter, bananas, and nutella was outstanding. Add to that the staff is great. I'm not much of a morning person, but this place turns that around quickly
