A large group of us made a dinner reservation a month prior, and was told upon being stuck in the corner with two crates for tables that they only take \"requests.\"  The owner came over only to blatantly refuse to take responsibility for the misrepresentation on his restaurant's part and rudely interrupt our attempt to resolve the issue with, \"I own other restaurants.\"  \n\nI have never seen such a mistreatment--not even in the snobby town of Scottsdale (no offense, people of Scottsdale).\n  \nIt was unfortunate, because the waitress (whose section we were sitting while making plans to move our night) was sweet.
