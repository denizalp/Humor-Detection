This was my forth time going to this restaurant. I return every time because of there appetizer nachos because they were the most unique and delicious nachos I've had. Unfortunately they were no longer on the menu. They had changed the menu according to our server ALEXANDERA! She was amazing and offered a similar dish. She was very nice and attentive! She really stood out to me because of her great service! I was sad about the nachos but the server made up for it! PLEASE BRING BACK THE NACHOS!
