I was left waiting in line for five minutes while the worker was cleaning his taco station, but then a Spanish speaker comes along and orders twelve tacos from the other line. Awesome, so then I was waiting for ten minutes just to order two tacos that ended up being half-assed because they ran out of salsa as well as the other toppings. I also ordered al pastor fries, which were super greasy. The meat looked burnt and tasted super dry. It definitely wasn't just cut off of the rotisserie. Uhhh, I felt like it was meant to be thrown away and not served to anyone. Finally, when I asked about Taco Tuesday, the cashier rudely dismissed me without answering my question. I was there during the correct hours but okay... Why promote your specials if you aren't going to honor them? In the future, I'll just make the drive to Tacos El Gordo.
