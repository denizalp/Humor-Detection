I ate at N9NE twice during my weekend Vegas trip. The first time we went, our eyes were bigger than our stomachs, so we ordered too much and didn't get to order dessert - which had been the sole reason I wanted to go in the first place. I had heard about their campfire s'mores dessert, but I had to come back a second time to actually get it. \n\nMy boyfriend had the filet mignon and when questioned about whether he enjoyed it, he said, and I quote, \"Uh, yeah, uh. It was solid.\" Basically, he liked it, and didn't have much to complain about. I chose to go with the Short Rib Ravioli as my entr√©e, since we were getting appetizers and sides. The ravioli was good. You don't get much, but it was enough for me with all the other food we were getting. \n\nWe got the Buffalo Chicken Wontons to start, which were okay. Not something to write home about. For our sides, we got the Lobster Mac and Cheese and truffle fries with garlic aioli. I was disappointed in both of them. I just didn't find the mac and cheese to be anything special, and it was overpriced for how little you get. The fries themselves were good, but the aioli was way too smooth and thin. It didn't taste like an aioli. It had no bite or tang to it. Just basically a watery garlic cream sauce. \n\nThe service was excellent on that trip. However, the service on the second trip for my dessert s'mores was a different story. We came in after the dinner rush, and basically after we got the s'mores, we never saw the waitress again. Our glasses were empty most of the time we were there on this dessert trip, and I get it - we had a low tip value. But that doesn't mean that we should get awful service. All we wanted was some more water. \n\nOther than the terrible service, I loved the idea of roasting your own marshmallows to make s'mores. More restaurants should implement it, honestly. It was a fun experience, and my boyfriend loved it. I would come back again just for that. Even with the non-existent service. \n\nThe restaurant is very \"club-like\" with its mood lighting and lounge-type furniture. It was loud with lots of people, and I wouldn't necessarily recommend this place as romantic date material. You would barely be able to hear each other over the din of people talking and music playing. I would say attire is club friendly to business professional to casual. \n\nOverall: 3\/5\nFood: 3\/5\nService: 3\/5\nAtmosphere: 2\/5
