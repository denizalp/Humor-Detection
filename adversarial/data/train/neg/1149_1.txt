I have been to Dicks several times on my visits to the city but never thought to write a review.  What can you say about Dicks?  Its loud, the food is okay and the Wait staff is rude....I love this place!  Where else can you go where you and the servers speak your mind?  The drinks are good.  Good selection of beers and always a killer band.  Of course there is always Taco and his famous lap dances and his water show.     I always have a good time at Dicks.   Be warned, you better have a good sense of humor and thick skin.  And if you don't enjoy yourself, don't bother complaining to the manager.  Read the warning at the door before you go in.
