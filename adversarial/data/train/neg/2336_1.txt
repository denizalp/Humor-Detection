MUCH more laid back than Skyzone or the other franchises we have hit.  Lots to do, many different stations for dodgeball, basketball, rock wall, different climbers.  Not overpopulated, which was a concern being in a city.  (Thursday AM-11-ish). Staff is friendly, interact with kids, keep it safe, but fun.  We've been to crowded sky zones and dealt with intolerant staff micromanaging fun.  This is awesomely laid back!
