I've been waiting over 5 years to see this show. Honestly, it wasn't as good as I thought. I've seen La Nouba and I've seen Mystere and I desired for more of the circus acts than anything. Love just seemed to be more dancing than anything else. We were kind of disappointed and also in the way that the stage was set up, it was sensory overload and not in a good way. I just felt like there was way too much going on at one time. Granted there were many parts that we liked, but with a show of this magnitude, it's easier to focus if you have a regular theatre set up. There were also some parts that I just didn't get. I don't think that this show will be something that we see again, but I'm at least glad that we saw it.
