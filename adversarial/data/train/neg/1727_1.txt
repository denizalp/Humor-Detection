We paid $2\/person and thought it was a great deal.  They have a bunch of houses that you can walk into, and see how people lived during the 60s.  I think most, if not all, of the artifacts were of the period. It was well worth the money.  There weren't that many people too.  We went around noon on a Friday in December.
