Been contemplating on joining since the ymca is always crowded and machines are always occupied. I had a free pass to check out this gym i obtained the pass earlier in the week by susie one of the sales rep i told her exactly what i needed she listened and acknowledge that i dont do the sales pitch BS. Today i decided to use my \"free\" pass and take a look and see if i really want to join a huge gym not sure if this is for me. I handed my free pass thinking ill walk right in instead they told me to talk to the sales guy i believe his name was victor had an appearance of a work release program guy not professional at all. He was rude, insulted me and got close to me like if he wanted to start a fight?? Pretty much he wanted a sale from me right then and there and was not smart enough to know how. He Ask for my id without asking why he needs it told me to read the sign. Really? My experience was very negative just trying to use my free pass. As a result of the salesperson actions i will not return. Ill put up with the crowded ymca gym for now.
