We accidentally came in here thinking it was Superior Pho. I just thought the \"#1 Pho\" sign was to indicate that they were voted the #1 Pho place in the city. I only figured out that I was in the wrong restaurant after we had ordered. I logged onto my Yelp account to check in, and I noticed there were two pho places on the same street. Tricky, tricky!!~\n\nAnyway, I am always down to try a new pho place. The broth was good, the noodles were cooked well (not too overcooked, not too chewy), and the meat was actually pretty decent. Sometimes, the meat is \"shiny\" like the scales of a fish. That usually makes me feel a little icky inside what it's like that, but it's not like that here. It was pretty tender and not too chewy or fatty. Overall, it's a legit bowl of pho and I would probably go here instead of Superior if I had to choose again. But I don't live in Cleveland, so I probably wouldn't have to make that kind of decision. But for those of you reading, I hope it's helpful.
