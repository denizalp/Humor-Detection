Great quick place for a nice hot lunch. They have different flavors of broth. The meat is really tender. And the service is great. One thing i didnt enjoy was the egg. I usually like it half cooked. But it was fully hardboiled. Other than that. Its a place i wouldnt mind going back to again. Especially since the prices are under $10
