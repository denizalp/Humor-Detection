BEST CLUB IN VEGAS\n\nI came here on two occasions 6\/4 on a Friday night to watch Big Sean and 8\/6 on a Saturday night to watch Trey Songz. Both times I've been here have been crazy! \n\nGetting in was a breeze especially when you get bottle service, which I did for both nights. Once you get in, the venue is jaw dropping. Our promoter Brian hooked my group up every time. On 6\/4 he got my group a table closer to the dance floor (even though we booked a farther table). It gets crazy when artists perform and sometimes people will end up blocking your view but it doesn't change the fact that I was listening to big Sean live! On 8\/6 we got a mezzanine table and the view was the best! Overlooking the entire venue and it was perfect for watching Trey songz. \n\nLong story short, go to drais! Best venue and top artists every weekend! If you need someone to set your group up, hit up Brian 1 (773) 459-8133 he can take care of all your Vegas needs and definitely not disappoint!
