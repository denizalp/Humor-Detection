I went to Nakama on Saturday for my birthday. I had a party of 9 and told the hostess my friend was in traffic and would be late. She insisted they could not seat us until everyone in my party arrived which to me seemed to inconvenience them more because we were occupying the lobby and seemed to be in the way. Once seated, it took long to get everything. A long wait to order drinks, then receive our drinks, then long to take our order. My reservation was for 8 and by 8:45 we hadn't even put our food order in. I ordered a margarita and 30min later I still hadn't received it so my friend complained to the manager who was walking around. He was very apologetic and explained our waitress was actually a hostess and he bought me the margarita. That definitely saved the night and I am thankful for his generosity. The food is good, your basic hibachi food. I didn't order sushi but my friends seemed to enjoy it.
