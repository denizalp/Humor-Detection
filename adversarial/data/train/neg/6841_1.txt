Cleanliness of a Canadian grocery with products and prices of and Asian foodmart. Great selection, great value and easy to navigate. A smidge cramped in some spots so it can be a bit hard to juggle your food and try to climb over people but it's not bad at all compared to most markets in China Town.\n\nFor about $50 I got about 2 weeks worth of groceries, mostly produce and frozen protein with some assorted sauces and noodles. I epecially loved the packs of tofu that had been pre-fried. They are made in Toronto and are super convenient to throw in soups, hotpots and stir-fries. \n\nGreat place to shop!
