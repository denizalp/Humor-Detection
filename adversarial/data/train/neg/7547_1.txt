For whatever reason, it has been difficult to find a consistent and timely landscaping company for our house\/yard. We have been using M&M landscaping for the last few months and they have made each appointment set and made sure to address any questions or concerns I had at the start. They have also consistently arrived for each service of our yard and did a great job with initial cleanup of the overgrowth within the yard. I would highly recommend M&M Landscaping to anyone looking for monthly service or a general cleanup.
