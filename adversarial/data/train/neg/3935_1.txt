Okay! I ate a Waldorf Salad last Monday from the shop on Tropicana and Ft. Apache, so I tried the shop on Sahara today and I am sooooo disappointed! I ordered the same salad Waldorf. No apples, 6 grapes, some cranberries and maybe 4  cubes of pineapple. I don't ever remember pineapple being on a Waldorf Salad, but okay no problem. The chicken was unseasoned and bland! Eating at this place today was not a great experience! Sorry to say, but man!!!
