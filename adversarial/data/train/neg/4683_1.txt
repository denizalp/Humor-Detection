TLDR: Pretty good quality\n\nI feel like Chipotle has been really hit or miss lately. Usually when there are any issues it's because the rice\/beans are under cooked and the food is too salty. luckily this one didn't have any of those issues.\n\nWe were in the area and needed to grab something really quickly to eat that was also whole30 compliant for my BF. We decided to go here and it turned out ok. My experiences at chipotle have yo-yoed back and forth so much lately that I honestly don't know what to expect from them anymore. The quality here was similar to back in the day when their food was still top notch. Hoping that the chain continues with these levels of performance and maintains good quality control.
