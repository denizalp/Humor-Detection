I'm so upset. Today was my birthday and my husband spent money to get a custom cake ordered. We just cut into it and I am shocked. The \"cake\" part is dry and crumbly, and doesn't even take up half the cake. The top half of the cake is completely made up of whipped cream\/frosting... is this how professional cakes are nowadays? We should have saved our money and made one homemade. Picture for reference (named scribbled out for privacy). One star for the perfect chocolate covered strawberries.
