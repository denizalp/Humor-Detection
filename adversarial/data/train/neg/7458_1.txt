LOVE these Employees! Sky ana Loren helped my grandaughter into her first buckle wardrobe. They treated her like a star, finding options in her size and even offered alterations. She went in there hating shopping and left with a new wardrobe and accessories. Thank you Buckle Empleyees Sky and Loren for making her time in your store so positive and fun. We will definitely be back!
