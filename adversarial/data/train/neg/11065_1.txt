Finally got to visit today.  Tried last night during First Friday but it was a madhouse.  Their little slider sandwiches are delicious....the bread is amazing.  I also got a pumpkin chocolate chip muffin and some sour cream sugar cookies. Holy Crap !!!  Talk about a sugar rush, but not a major one.  The mix of pumpkin and chocolate chip is divine and the fall leaf themed cookies made me feel as if I were back in PA.\n\nI'll definitely be back.
