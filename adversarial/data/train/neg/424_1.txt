The only time I set foot in the Libra Lounge was to shoot a short film. The owner was super nice to us and everything worked out well but it left me thinking that I would never ever go there for drinks. Ever. Imagine my surprise when I ended up there for drinks under it's new management and moniker, Bar Hop.\n\nRob Pingitore has taken over the space and made, in my opinion, one of the best beer bars in the city. They have a great selection on tap and in bottles but you'd expect that from someone that's spent a decade plus in the craft beer world.\n\nI think it's fair to point out that Bar Hop feels a lot like Smokeless Joe's because the menu's are almost identical as is the feel. The only real difference is the location and interior of the bar itself. Some changes have been made from it's Libra Lounge days and I'm glad they kept the patio (and took out the paintings\/photos that used to hang on the walls) but it's still kind of an awkward place. The little bowl near the front is crowded once you get a few people sitting there and if they happen to be loud you won't hear your own conversation. The patio is nice and gives you a good spot to people watch as King and Spadina is a high traffic area. The bar looks good and the tables just across from it are large and comfortable and really the only place I would want to sit.\n\nAll and all, Bar Hop is great and the fact that it is literally next door to my office made me one happy camper.
