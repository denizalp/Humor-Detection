My husband and I came here for the first time today for breakfast. We're not from the area and were looking for a good home-style breakfast. Drew's was easy to find and we had no problems with parking. It almost reminded us of a King's. There was no wait for a Saturday morning (8:30am) and there was plenty of seating. Our waitress was attentive and polite. My husband ordered the Breakfast Sampler (french toast, eggs, bacon, sausage). According to him, the french toast was \"excellent\" and eggs were \"cooked exactly right\" (over-medium). I had the Belgian Waffle and added eggs (2). Everything was really good and the best part was the warm syrup. Even the iced tea was better than most diners I've been to. It's a shame this place isn't too close for us or we would definitely go more often!
