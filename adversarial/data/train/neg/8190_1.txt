Lori Strathdee is an excellent Registered Massage Therapist (RMT) running Yorkdale Wellness. Her staff of RMTs are generally trained by Sutherland Chan School & are very competent also. The spa has the soothing elegant atmosphere of a retreat, not that of a sterile medical clinic . And Lori keeps changing the decor to keep things fresh. Our family have been coming to Yorkdale Wellness for years & this, in our experience, is the best place for massage & other holistic services. Besides massage, services include Nutritional Cleansing, Chiropodist, Low-Intensity Laser Therapy, Psychotherapist,  and Personal Trainer.
