I visited the Blue Ribbon with a group of 30 for a friends birthday. We had the private room and a set\/limited menu. The seafood tower was amazing as well as the salads. I ordered the steak which was delicious, however when I saw some of my friends fried chicken I was pretty jealous. I was lucky enough to get a taste and oh my. The most crispy and juicy fried chicken I've ever had. I also tasted the mashed potatoes which were perfect. We had the chocolate chip bread pudding and it was delicious. The private room was simple but perfect for our group. The service was great but i did feel like the server needed a little more help at times. But i really have no complaints. There was a man there in the beginning that may have been the GM or event Coordinator but he was very nice and seemed in control of everything. I would love to go back again.
