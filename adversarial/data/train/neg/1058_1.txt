Music is good the dance floor is great lots of seating ,However the service and prices are HORRIBLE, First time there I order 2 beers and food for my friend and I we got up to dance and  our drinks and food where picked up from the table ? We literally had one bite of our food and maybe 2 sips of our drinks I was shocked that they  expected me to pay for something they removed from my table and we didn't get to eat ? Second time there I went with a Group of friends we literally sat there a good 30 minutes without anyone acknowledging us I finally got the servers attention and order 2 buckets of beer and the server took our Debit cards and ID's throughout the whole place we watched her talk to several gentleman at the club after 20 minutes of not getting our drinks and her flopping her gums and flirting with clients,  I got up asked her for our cards and ended up getting 1 bucket  from the bar had or drinks and left somewhere else.
