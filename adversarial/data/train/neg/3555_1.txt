I must say that the cab was at least pretty immaculate compared to what I've experienced in taxi cleanliness. However, what should have been an 8 mile trip to my office from the airport cost me $25 not including tip. The driver took the long way around using freeways instead of the most direct route. I wasn't expecting more than $20 for such a short trip, so I had to pay credit instead of cash and it was a big hassle. \n\nI wouldn't say it was a horrible experience, just that I'm not sure the ride was worth the price.
