I didn't purchase my car here but I do get it serviced here on a regular basis since purchasing my 06 G35 Sedan in 2008. I've never had any issues other than routine maintenance and I drive a ton. I'm a Realtor who assists Buyer's and Seller's in the East Valley so I drive probably 30,000 miles a year. I absolutely love my car and I'm definitely an Infiniti guy for life. The Service Department is very customer service oriented and I've never felt taken advantage of. This is important to me when it comes to my car as I don't know much when it comes to repairs. They may cost a little more than a regular mechanic but I trust them and in my opinion you can't put a price tag on that. Repairs are just part of owning a car, it's unfortunate when they are needed, but it's nice to have a place to go where I can count on them to do an honest and good job. They also offer free rental cars if your Infiniti is in need of service, which is a nice perk.
