I recently experienced the Yardbird Southern Table & Bar while staying at the Venetian for a conference trip to Las Vegas. The atmosphere of the restaurant itself intrigued me, setup as a half-bar, half-restaurant establishment painted in black but somehow trying to imagine itself as modern southern chic? That is the best way I can describe it, especially considering that there was a projector displaying images of various southern icons on one wall mixed aside barn-style egg baskets hung up by the ceilings. All of this decor would be perfectly fine, if this restaurant actually had food that lived up to its southern-inspired roots. \n\nAfter our waitress gave us an incredible overview of their southern fried chicken, I decided to order a southern fried eggs benedict from their brunch menu. Although it was presented nicely, there was something about the chicken that just didn't taste right. It almost seemed like it was slightly undercooked (although it was hard to tell because the mood lighting i the restaurant was very dark). Additionally, the skin was not as crisp as authentic fried chicken that I have had at other restaurants, which of course is the main appeal of fried chicken in the first place. My boyfriend was lured into this restaurant by a burger that promised a pile of brisket, bacon, pork belly, and other meats stacked on top of it. However, when the burger came out there was barely any meat on it and from what I saw there definitely was not any brisket on it (unless the brisket was so thin it couldn't be seen?). \n\nWe were so tired from walking around the strip, that we chose not to waste our energy on complaining about the burger and simply left, full but unsatisfied. I wanted to post this review mainly as a reminder to myself and fellow yelpers that sometimes it really is best to go to certain restaurants according to locale...because apparently this Las Vegas joint was not able to recreate the the food of the American South, despite its best efforts.
