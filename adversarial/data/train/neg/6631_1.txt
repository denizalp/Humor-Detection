Whoever the two girls were working on February 14th around 6 pm need some talking to about professionalism and sanitation. Both of them were very slow and dressed entirely in everyday clothes - every other cold stone I have ever been to they were specific uniforms or at least aprons and hats. Both of them had those long, gross fake nails and were NOT USING ANY GLOVES!! I watched on girl go straight from handling money to handling ice cream, as well as touching food items (Oreos and Reese's out of the packaging) with her bare hands and putting them into ice cream. The ice cream was good as usual but the girls were so unprofessional it was concerning. One of them had her bangs all up in her face and over the ice cream. It was really kind of gross to watch. I hope management reads these reviews and talks to staff about the things they see here, because the two young ladies working either need some re-training or replacements. I will not be returning to this location for Cold Stone ice cream.
