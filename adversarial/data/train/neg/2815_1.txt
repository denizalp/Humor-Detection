Not a great place. 8 of us came over from an Indians game and we were told we wouldn't be served. This is coming from a guy who is currently driving home. Had two beers at the game. The female manager thought we had too much to drink. Gave the server $20 because he literally said \"I'm not sure what her problem is, you guys are perfectly fine and the other (male) manager said your guys are fine to drink\". He got a tip for doing nothing but being a decent person, the same as we should all be.
