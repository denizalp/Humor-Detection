The food is quite good- but the noise level, especially when they have live music is horrendous. Additionally we had to ask the manager three  times to turn the music down so we could have a normal conversation with our dinner companions.I also did not appreciate having to share the bathroom with male guests. I don't care if that is customary in Europe- it was very uncomfortable. The coffee with dessert was cold and when we asked the waiter about getting hot coffee, he was not very agreeable about it and we never did get fresh, hot coffee. They also seem very disorganized, even though the wait staff seem helpful, it appears no one is in control of the chaos there.
