I've had a good couple of experiences with Spoon and Fork. First experience was when we ordered in a plethora of different dishes to the office for lunch. Spoon and Fork seemed to be the best option for our group, offering a wide range of dishes from everywhere...Green curry! Mango Fried Rice! Caesar Salad! A strange but awesome mixture of whatever you're looking for can be found here. \nSecond experience - was looking for a 'winter warmer' (ie. soup!) and came here for some wonton soup - very nice, although I was tempted by their $12 lunch menu where you can pick a full meal out of 15 or so options and it's $12. I'll definitely have to come back and take advantage of that, and on a hungrier day...their AYCE tasting menu! It's also very reasonably priced ($19 is the price when I went at lunch). \nVery nice inside and larger than expected. The plaza it's in is kinda terrible though, and parking is scarce especially at lunch. If you go around the side, there is garage parking. Kinda tucked away, but it helps on those days where spots out front are just non-existent!
