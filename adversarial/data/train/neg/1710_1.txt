This patio furniture store carries several different styles of outdoor and patio furnitures, at very reasonable price range.  Resin wicker, also known as all-weather wicker, is used in outdoor patio furniture. It is meant to look like natural wicker, but is made of a synthetic material which means they last longer and can be made into more slick shapes than traditional wickets.  And that's what I bought, a slick and modernized wicker L-shaped sofa.  It's wonder to lay in it during Spring to Autumn in Vegas.  They also carry iron framed furniture and table for outdoors, in more traditional styles.  \nAdding icing on the cake is the in-house customization of outdoor cushions. I liked the fabric pattern on my sofa, but wanted thicker cushions and taller seat back cushion.  So I requested for them to use the fabric that I preferred, and customized the fabric to thicker seat cushions and taller seat backs. They only charged $80 for this customization.  And delivery fee of only $30.  \nThe shop keepers were present to answer any questions, but generally kept a distance to give you space to browse through the floor.  It was a pleasant shopping experience.  Will be going back to order more customized lounge chair cushions to match my new sofa cushion.  Love it when a store has the ability to do customization on site.  Shop local !\nAfter a week delay due to out of stock cushion fabric, patio set finally delivered with upgraded fabric at no extra charge. The inside of the hard unit is very well constructed, not flimsy like some lesser models I've seen. Very comforts to seat in with the 5\" inch cushions which I paid extra for. Over all, worth the wait (fabric being out of stock, not retailers fault), and definitely worth the price paid.
