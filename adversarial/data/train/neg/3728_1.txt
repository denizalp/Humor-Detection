let me start out by saying this place has the absolute best lobster bisque!! even better than delmonico's (sorry guys. more lobster per bite.) i got the chicken marsala and my boyfriend got filet mignon. he said his filet was in the top 5 best steaks he's ever had. mine was also very good. it's a bit more pricey than comparable places.. the thing that really got my attention was THE CUSTOMER SERVICE. oh my gosh. i can't say enough about it. our waitress was adorable and so personable. she filled our wine glasses every time she came to check on us, which is always amazing (i can't remember her name, but i'm also terrible with names. so sorry...) the owner\/manager came around and personally checked on each table multiple times. every restaurant should strive for this level of service.
