I really enjoy coming here! All the employees are extremely helpful and always go out if their way to help a newbie at this whole gardening thing. They also always offer to help me carry out my soil or any heavy items for me. I feel comfortable asking any questions, no one ever makes me feel stupid, and if someone I ask doesn't know the answer they find someone who does. This place is great and I will forever be a loyal customer!
