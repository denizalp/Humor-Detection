We are staying at a hotel nearby so my wife and son and I ate her twice here in the last two days. We had dietary restrictions that the manager came out to discuss with us personally at our table. She was very professional and took care of us. On our second visit, there was a mixup in the kitchen and they made the food with dairy so they had to start over. This delayed our food which we had to take to go. For our troubles the manager took care of our bill. We made sure to leave a good tip as our server was very attentive.  Regardless of the food error, the service was again excellent and we were very happy with our visit.
