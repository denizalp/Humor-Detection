Great pizza.  Fair wine selection.  Only pizza place in Desert Ridge?  Makes it better by default I suppose.  Kind of a theme up here.  Everything is \"the only\" whatever.  \"In and out\" is the only drive through fast food place.  Albertson's (nee Safeway) is the only grocery store.  The gas station.  Target is The big box shop.
