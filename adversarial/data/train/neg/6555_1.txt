Salmon was salty, potatoes were somehow chewy and dry, green beans were undercooked and flavorless and I only received 4 small, dry mushroom pieces. For a $24 dish, I am VERY unhappy and dissatisfied. Clam chowder was good, boyfriends scallops were not bad. This restaurant is full of itself and pretends to be NYC hip. My guess is they spent too much on decor and didn't have enough in the budget for a decent chef, which is surprising based on their expensive dishes.
