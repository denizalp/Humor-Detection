We had to find emergency lodging for one night after a couple hundred people were stranded in Toronto by WestJet.  They had a decent deal on a room. \n\nBooking was fast.  The greeter at our desk could not have been nicer.  The room was lovely.  Modern design with a dandelion seed painted on the wall.  SUPER comfy bed.  Clean working pool and hot tub.  Since we didn't have a car we stayed at the hotel Bistro for dinner.  Very tasty!!\n\nThis is a relatively new hotel but I HIGHLY Recommend if you're staying in the area.
