I came here when I was in town visiting my sister.  She recommended it because she said they played hip hop music.  Apparently it is not like that at all times.  When I went, I think they were playing techno.  It wasn't my scene.\n\nYay:\n-A variety of drinks\n-Mixed crowd \n\nNay:\n-Music: I guess it varies depending on the night you go.  I wasn't into the music when I went.\n-The crowd: Similar to the music, it also varies depending on the day you go.  When I went, I felt like the crowd was under the influence of things other than alcohol.  It was very crowded as well.  Hard to move around without bumping into someone.\n-White Rabbit:  this drink was interesting.  I thought it was going to taste like the white rabbit candy, but it tasted like coconut.  If you like coconut, this is the drink for you.\n\nI'm sure I went on a night that wasn't suitable for me.  I may or may not go back.
