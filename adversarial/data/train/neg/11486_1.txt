This Denny's has the worst service! They can't get an order right. Forget ordering a salad you will never get it. We have been coming to this Denny's for a long time and it's always the same. It's pretty sad when you walk in the door and it takes them 15 minutes to even acknowledge your standing there with only 5 people in the whole place. Food is good but very poor service!
