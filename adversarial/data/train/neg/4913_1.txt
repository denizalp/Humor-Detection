I would give them 5 but the cashier lady that got our order yesterday (March 26 2017 around 5pm) she was kind of rude and she was eating while she was taking my order, not only at that time she was eating during chopping the radishes and while she was waiting for the food to be ready to take it to the tables..... I think that's not professional, I'm pretty sure she could've ask the other lady to cover her shift so she can go eat.\nI love this place I remember going to this place since 2010 and the other cashier that used to take my order she was really nice and had a professional appearances. The food is fresh and has great taste. The portions are fair to what you are paying.
