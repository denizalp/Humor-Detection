I hired Synergy HomeCare to help take care of my Mother in law. She's in her 80s and is slowly losing her faculties plus she is on high doses of pain meds for various reasons. Both my husband and I work, and it was becoming impossible to tend to her completely. \n\nNow with aid from Jessica, Mom has the help she needs. And honestly, Mom couldn't be happier. She absolutely loves Jessica and looks forward to her weekly visits. Ask she ages, we expect to increase the frequency of visits, and with Synergy's no contract policy, that will be easy. \n\nI feel lighter and less stressed now that this company is in my life. I trust Jessica with Mom and Mom loves her. It just doesn't get better than this!
