What a great spot for a delicious, healthy lunch and\/or smoothie. Unique combinations that don't taste like every other \"healthy\" spot out there. The staff are kind and friendly. Love this joint. More of a takeout place as there's no seating (only a stand-up area where you can eat if you'd like).
