Wanted to see what they had for doughnut selections, just got a dozen doughnuts at Dunkin (Since THERE IS NONE IN THE NORTHWEST!) Anyway, the selection was pretty good here, (although wish they had a Strawberry filled doughnut) \nThe prices here were pretty reasonable, and this places was nicely done, although the parking seemed a bit weird IMO- but they probably dont have much say in that.\nThe lady behind the counter was very friendly and helpful!
