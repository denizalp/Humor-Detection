Horrible.  I ordered a salad and soft drink from the pizza place.  They charge $4.50 for a soft drink.  Then when I went to pick up my salad,  I saw it under the heat lamp cooking.  \n\nThe Smashburger place was also bad, salad was horrible, long wait when not very many people, also charged $4.50 soft drink.  No salad dressing was put in the takeout order.\n\nSkip this one, for $15 you get food worse than McDonalds.
