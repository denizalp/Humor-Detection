I'm surprised this place has only 3.5 stars!\nI'm a HUGE fan of the Wynn and Encore, and definitely a regular in most of the restaurants here. \n\nWith that being said, after having brunch at almost every spot on property several times I must say that brunch here was the best one I've had! Probably in Vegas. \n\n1. Everything is neat and classy. \n2. The food is DELICIOUS. \n3. The service is amazing and the servers will go above and beyond for you. \n4. Portions are big.\n5. The view to the pool is beautiful. \n\nIf you're thinking of brunch here at Wynn, definitely stop by!\nTrust me. I know food.
