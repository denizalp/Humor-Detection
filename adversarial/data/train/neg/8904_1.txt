Worst asian food ever! My family and I went here for lunch - huge disappointment. We all love asain food so we were excited to try a new place while visiting UW. All six of the dishes we ordered were aweful. We started with crab rangoon (a safe choice and hard to screw up). It was greasey and tasted as if fried in old, dirty oil. They may have used motor oil for all I know. Here's the funny thing: it was the best item we ate for lunch, but it was aweful too. We all had a chicken dish, except my son who had pork dumplings which had more ginger and a mystery ingredient than pork - yuck! Four of the five chicken dishes had very little chicken. I would estimate 1\/2 to 1 ounce of chicken (3 bites). My daughter's boyfriend ordered orange chicken because the restaurant was \"out\" of sweet and sour chicken. How is that even possible? He said his orange chcken didn't taste like chicken at all. Hum? My \"chicken\" was flavorless as if it was boiled and sitting in a vat of water until it was time to add to the dish. \n\nThis place ranks as the number 1 worst restaurant I have ever eaten at, especially because all six dishes were so bad. It was also the worst $80 I have ever spent. The service was so poor too. When we asked the waitress if the the food was good, she replied, \"uhm, you decide\" in her asian acent. She did't provide appitizer plates, forgot the condiments for a few dishes, however she did keep the water glasses topped off. After the meal, the manager asked us if our meal was good (everyone's plates were still nearly full) and we replied, \"the food wasn't very good.\"  We expected him to say, \" ya, we hear that a lot\", but he just nodded and walked away. Maybe the restaurant is named Dragon 1 because it is the number 1worst place to eat in Madison. I can only pray that there is not a Dragon 2, 3, or more. There are many other asian restaurants in Madison and I would strongly suggest any of them.
