If I had two more hands, I'd give Juans 4 thumbs up!  This is Mexican food on a whole'nether level! My experience lived up to the hype. The food was phenomenal.  There are Mexican restaurants everywhere but nothing compares......I highly recommend the fajitas and quesadilla, I'm getting hungry just thinking about it and I'm stuffed! \nJuans has a cool atmosphere, plenty of tv's to watch football and the staff was incredibly friendly!
