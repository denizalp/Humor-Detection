Wow. Just when I was losing hope, just when I was being shuffled from dr. to dr. to specialist to specialist with my brother who is sick and cannot seem to get help (it's been 14 dr. appointments to date) - Something goes our way, Dr. Banich. I only wish he could be my brother's full-time doctor. He's so kind, so thorough, so knowledgeable - a breath of fresh air for those of us searching for help and not getting compassion, not getting answers, not getting help. Ironically my brother was referred to Dr. Banich to have his gallbladder removed. Dr. Banich reviewed every piece of paperwork and says, at this time, there is not enough evidence to remove my brother's gall bladder. He referred us back to the primary care doctor with a full page write up, that hopefully will help lead us, finally, in the correct direction. Thank you sir, thank you very much.
