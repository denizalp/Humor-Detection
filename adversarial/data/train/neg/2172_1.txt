There are two kinds of people in the world: those that love to pay $9 for a tall non-dairy non-fat soy latte with imported organic whipped cream and those that like coffee and I loves me my coffee. Tim Hortons will get you that without raping your wallet.\n\nThis Timmies location is attached to a Wendy's and is open 24\/7. It's conveniently located near Kipling subway station for a quick pick me up at 5 am, whether you're heading to work or just coming home.\n\nAnd for a typical fast-food type place, the service is excellent.
