The pub\/restaurant is fairly busy most nights and is staffed well. The servers are very friendly and know the menu well. The food arrives quickly, and hot. The shepherds pie is very good, though it could be a little bigger and topped with more cheese. \nThey also have a good selection of beers on tap, a little something for everyone.
