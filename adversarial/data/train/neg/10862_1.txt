I ate it before I took a picture haha it was Sooo good! I got the chicken tenders combo and chose fries to be the side. The fries were thin cut and delicious! They have a ton of sauce choices but I chose ranch and it was really good!!! The soda machine is also those customized soda machines so you can make cool combos. The service through drive thru was still a face to face order which I thought was a cool concept for drive thru. Overall I highly enjoyed my visit and will be back soon!
