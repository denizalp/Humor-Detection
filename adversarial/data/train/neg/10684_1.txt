I had a delicious dinner. The chicken piccata was EXCELLENT!!! I am definitely a fan of angel hair pasta, and this one has a lemon sauce that just kept calling my name. The mushrooms and capers topped it off real fine. \n   The waiter was fantastic. He had a great sense of humor and was very observant. The bartender knows how to make a mean amaretto sour. \n   Can't go to the Cheesecake Factory and not order cheesecake..... The choices go on and on. I decided on the cherry cheesecake and I was not disappointed. It was good to the last bite. \n    Wish we had a Cheesecake Factory in Charleston, SC.\n     10 out of 10!!!\nYUMOLA!!!!
