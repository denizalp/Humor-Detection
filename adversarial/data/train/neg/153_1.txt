I don't normally give a two-star rating, but this place deserves it. We visited for brunch on Sunday and got there a few minutes after they opened; there was only one other group in the restaurant.\n\nThe hostess seated us, got us water, and told us our server would be right over. We waited and waited. Finally the very nice hostess came over to take our drink order. Then we waited and waited. I had to call the hostess over to take our food order. They were out of sausage. They were out of fruit. Then we waited FORTY minutes for our food. During this time, the hostess, our actual server, and the maybe 24 year-old hipster manager came over to each tell us a different reason why our food was taking so long - the manager said a breaker had blown, the server said they didn't have enough help in the kitchen so she had to jump in, and the hostess said she didn't know what was going on. They all apologized, but it was a disaster of epic proportions.\n\nOnce we finally got our food (more than an hour after we were seated), my eggs were wrong (scrambled instead of over-hard), and the fella's burger was well-done instead of medium. They refilled my father-in-law's coffee with cold coffee. To their credit, they brought all of us coffee from Joe & Nosh next door (what happened to The Packhouse's coffee?) and they kindly found me some fruit even though they said they were out.\n\nThe only saving grace to this whole disaster was that they comped our meal. This was our second time visiting, but the first time wasn't great either. We won't be back.
