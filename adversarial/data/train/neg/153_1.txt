First off, let me start by saying how much I appreciate the fact that the food not only comes in a bag, but with a metal plate\/bowl-like container to dump the seafood in! \n\nThe sauce was amazing, got the mild Smokin. Soooo good! So much flavor, not too oily, and the spice level was just right.\n\nVery good customer service. I would recommend this place to anyone! Even 2 of my friends showed up in the middle of dinner to try this place out haha
