Master Estep and his wife Jackie run an amazing Taekwondo dojo. Both are very down to earth , professional, courteous people. My son has been with them for 3 years, and has learned respect, confidence, self control and so much more. He has also learned how to defend himself against bullies in school, and how to work hard at your goals in life. Bottom line, if you are interested in taekwondo, whether an adult or sending your child, look no further than Master Estep's taekwondo.
