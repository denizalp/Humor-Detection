We have our 3 and 6 year olds signed up for their 2nd season of Lil Kickers - we love it.  The kids are well engaged in games all the while learning how to play soccer.  At first I wasn't sure how much soccer a 2 year old could learn, but my youngest learned how to keep her eye on the ball as she learned the difference between big and little kicks.  Now in our second season, and 3 years old, she has graduated up to more difficult tasks....yet through play so she has no idea she's working on a skill!\n\nThe coaches are fun and energetic.  None of my kids have felt left out even when they had an \"off day\" - due to lack of nap time (my fault).  We've made great friends with the other kids in class and have yet to hear anything but raves.\n\nWhen we first wanted to try them out we visited an open house, we'll continue to go till the kids are too old!
