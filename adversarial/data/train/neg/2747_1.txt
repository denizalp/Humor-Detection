My review is for the night\/bar version of box car social. Great atmosphere, nice list of craft beers, but a 11-13oz glass is the same price as a 20oz glass in most other bars. That's nearly twice the price. I recognized a few mid-level affordable whisky on the menus for $10-$15 per oz. overpriced IMO. I'll have to come back during the day and check out their coffee. \nThis is a really nice place, I wish it were more affordable.
