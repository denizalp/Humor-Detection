Its a boutique so expect to spend Boutique like prices. \n\nYou can find a variety of great things in Hiptique from clothing to jewelry to home decor to baby items to some cute bags to odds and ends to spa items.  There's a little bit of everything for everyone...well maybe not EVERYONE as they don't sell anything for boys\/men. \n\nThe staff is nice. They're actually pretty fun. \n\nThe best time to visit Hiptique in my opinion is when they're having their sales. As those \"boutique prices\" drop and I mean DROP. \n\nWalk in look around. If you don't find anything that visit maybe on your next you will.
