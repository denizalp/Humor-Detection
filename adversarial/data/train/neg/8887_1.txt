Hate to say it, but I bought their Beginner's Henna Tattoo kit for $60.00 & it is horrible! The CD provided is all pdf files but lack in important information on \"how to's\" and focus more on the history. They also have no audio when watching the demonstration videos provided, the videos themselves don't really explain anything. The kit also comes with a variety of supplies but nothing really worth $60.00 dollars...\n Have been teaching myself without the kit since I didn't find it useful & have learned more about the true history (not just the one area of henna, Africa;  this kit targets but all 4\/5 areas) and different supplies, recipes for henna mixtures and techniques through other resources instead.  So it's not a bad place to buy supplies from but not the kit itself :(
