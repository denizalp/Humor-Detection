I called at 2:15 on a Sunday afternoon, was told a tech would be here between 4 and 6, and Jason was here before 4 PM.  He could see right away that our issue was a broken Torsion Spring, just as we had told the scheduler.  He was honest with me up front about the possible costs, we have an older unit and setup, and promised to let me know if he ran in to any issues.  Jason had everything he needed on his truck and got right to work.  In less than an hour he was finished.  Two new springs, a bearing, and $440 later, my garage door was working again.  He had some other suggested repairs which we will be doing in the coming months.  I really appreciate the courtesy and professionalism Jason showed, respect goes a very long way in my book.  I also really appreciate that my card was charged right away so I didn't have to wait to account for the expense.  It is nice to be able to get these kinds of home repairs done on our days off and not have to adjust our schedules!  I would highly recommend the services of A-Authentic Garage Door Service and we will definitely use them again when we are prepared to replace the motor.
