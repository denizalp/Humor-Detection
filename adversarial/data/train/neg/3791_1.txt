If you want an east coast style sub this is the place to go! Being originally from PA I love a great Philly Cheese Steak sub and finding a good authentic one is tough to do out here! \n\nYes this place isn't Pat's or Geno's of Philadelphia but the sandwiches are pretty darn good! They also carry Wise potato chips another East coast staple! I just wish they still had Tastykakes and my whole PA experience would be complete!
