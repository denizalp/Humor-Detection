The restaurant is totally authentic the only thing that I can say about their plates its art, starting from the perfect presentation to the best taste. As they say that when a person is eating he is using all of his senses by smelling the food, listening to it, tasting it, closing your eyes when you enjoy the taste. This is the restaurant that you really want to try if all your senses could function well in.
