My favorite mani\/pedi in AZ thus far! It was a really clean and comfortable salon. The technicians were really sweet as well! I got an organic hot stone spa pedicure and gel manicure, which came out really well. Loved the color selection. I found them through a Groupon package, making it super affordable. Even though it's a bit pricier w\/o the Groupon, I think it's worth it for how clean the salon is. The only downside for me is I don't like getting my toes and hands done at the same time. They had me twist my body so they could do my mani on the side of the chair while getting my pedicure. This meant I couldn't relax and use the massage feature of the chair, which was irritating. But the process took exactly one hour so if you prefer a quick nail job over a more relaxing, drawn out experience, this could be good for you. I was the last client of the day but in the future, I'll request to get the services done separately if possible.
