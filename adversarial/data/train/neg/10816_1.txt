I go to this place a lot for good Chinese food for cheap, great when your in a rush and in the area! I don't always have the time to go all the way to china town to get good Chinese food and so not just noodles does the trick $5.60 for either fried noodles or rice and your choice of meet on the hot table they Also have a menu online and with a little planning you can call ahead order whatever you want off the menu they'll make it fresh and have it ready when you get there! The staff isn't too friendly but honestly I don't really care all that I care about is that the food is good for a fair price.\n\nI don't think I could pick my favourite dish from here it's all good and again a good price flavoured well and the portions are huge and extremely fresh they definitely make it to order!
