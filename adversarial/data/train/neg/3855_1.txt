Very good. Friendly and patient service. The ribeye was juicy and delicious. The bone marrow was very flavorful. My wife had the salmon which was delectable. One son had the bison burger and my other had the lamb burger. Both were excellent. We all shared a pan fried corn and it was a perfect accompaniment as a side. The menu included pork belly, elk burger, and venison tenderloin. I wish my stomach was bigger but they leave more for the next visit!\n\nHighly recommend!
