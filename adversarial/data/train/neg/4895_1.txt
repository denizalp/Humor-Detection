This place is my absolute favorite Mexican restaurant. Their food is amazing from start to finish. The chips and salsa also come with bean dip and awesome grilled jalape√±os. Their fajitas are delicious. I especially appreciate that they can be ordered with grilled vegetables in place of rice and beans. The fideo soup is also delicious. I drive forty minutes from my neighborhood to eat here anytime I want Mexican food. The staff is always friendly and attentive. Our drinks are never empty and the food is always served fresh and hot.
