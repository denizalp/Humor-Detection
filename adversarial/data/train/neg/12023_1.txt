An absolutely classic bowling alley! Nothing fancy but everything you might need for a fun time. Personally, I love the fact that it still has the look and feel of a bygone era. Not crowded at all on the Saturday afternoon we came. Staff is friendly, and beer is cold. Highly recommend checking it out!
