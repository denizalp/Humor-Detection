I'll have to add to the positive reviews here.  I scheduled an appointment with Jason, and when he never showed up, I gave him a call to find out what the mix-up was.  He was very apologetic and took 50% off the price he quoted me.  He knows how to take care of his customers and how to correct any mistakes.\n\nHe performed some basic exterminating and preventative measures for some roach problems I was having.  It worked beautifully and really have not had any major problems since.  He did a good job explaining everything and pointed out the problem areas and how to help prevent issues in the future.
