9\/25\/16: This was our first time to this location. Positives: 1. Seated within 10mins of waiting. 2. Great service from waiter. \n\nIt took 20-30 minutes to get our food after ordering and food came out cold. \n\nThe cashier took care of the bill, which  was a positive as that was not was I was going for just wanted to voice my concerns so management could improve. Thank You!\n\nI know this location just opened so willing to go back in a few months to give them another try.
