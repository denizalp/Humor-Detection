I generally like SF supermarket to buy fresh crabs compared to the other markets in town but time it was really bad.  I went around 730pm and purchased crabs at decent price.  The worker picked the crabs from a tank in the back not the tank that was being displayed.  The crabs were large and live.  Steamed the crabs for about 20 minutes.  Opened them and they gave a strong AMMONIA smell.  To my understanding, usually when crabs smell like that they are spoiled.  But these crabs were live going in the pot so the water they were probably in was really dirty and not cleaned.  To my disgust we bagged them up and returned them.  The manager gave us difficulty saying no one complains and told us not to buy crabs there again.  Well here is your first compliant and I will never buy fresh seafood there again.
