Trying the whole vegan thing and this place made it easy. Mac and cheese with \"chicken\" fingers was Dynamite. Also tried the poutine and dumplings with \"beef\". Everything had so much flavour and I would definitely return. If I could say one bad thing was there was a fruit fly problem which was annoying.
