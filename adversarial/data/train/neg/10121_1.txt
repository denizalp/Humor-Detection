What to do when insomnia sets in?  Write yelp reviews lol.  So i went to Basil Box a few hours ago after securing coupons for a free drink and meal.  This is a Thai restaurant.  How it works is that you line up to order your food as if you are back in a high school cafeteria.  You are then asked to pick your carb first, so i chose pasta.  Next comes the veggies.  I went for corn and peppers since i was allowed to pick two.  Then protein.  My friends went for shrimps but i opted for steak instead.  The steak was more akin to dices of beef.  2nd last step is to select your sauce.  In this case, they encouraged me to be creative by mixing chilli lime sauce with peanut sauce.  Finally you choose toppings for your dish.  I told them to sprinkle a bit of everything on my pasta.\nTo be honest i was apprehensive about this quirky dish that i created what with 2 different sauces mixed together, but i have to say it wasn't bad.  The steak should really just be called beef.  It was a bit spicy and flavourful.  I liked the nuts and mixes that were thrown into the pasta.  The food was ok.  \nI also ordered mango ginger ale soda and boy! That was a great refreshing summer drink!  My friends ordered Thai iced tea and all said it was too sweet.\nAnd that was my friday night food experience.  That's all folks!
