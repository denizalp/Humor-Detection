Tried the North Scottsdale location finally for the first time and wished I had done it sooner. Everybody there is friendly and helpful. They had great suggestions for me and I really liked the atmosphere. Great music and TV's everywhere. Feels like comfortable lounge. Get the Cocomo if you like coconut. Add banana flavoring if you want to try something different.
