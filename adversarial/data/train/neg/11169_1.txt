Cool Snazzy Joint!\n\nBeen here 2 times now, because it is quite close by to where I live.  It's always nice to try out new places when they pop up, because you never know... it just might become your new go-to place.\n\nThis place is a lot larger than the Chatime down the road, which allowed for a little more breathing space.  Their ordering line was off to the side, and placed in such a way that they were not extremely in the way of the customers picking up their orders.  The overall ergonomics of the cafe was much more well thought out.  \n\nBoth times I ordered the Okinawa Milk Tea, with grass Jelly, because I'm not the most adventurous person when it comes to ordering bubble tea.  I've tried quite a lot of flavors in my time and in my opinion nothing really beats an original milk team especially when they use a specialty blend of tea (my favorite had to be the roasted rice milk green tea from bubble tea, but they've unfortunately discontinued that product due to 'clogging the espresso machine').  \n\nTo me I feel that the drink was a little too sweet, and took away from the taste of the actual tea.  To some this would be a good thing, to me it wasn't.  At the end of the day though, I was still pleased with my drink.\n\nMy second time there I ordered a cheesecake as well because I felt like it (do I really need another reason?); it was average.  Probably store bought from a place like La Rocca or something to that effect. They had a caramel crunch that looked interesting, perhaps I will try it on my next visit.  \n\nI've seen in previous pictures\/reviews that this place offers complimentary popcorn if you dine-in, also something I should try.  \n\nFinally, They probably have the coolest loyalty card of all of them (looks wise).  \n\nPros: + Decently large place\n+ Free popcorn(?)\n+ Cool Loyalty Card \n+ Drinks were okay\n\nCons: - Drinks\/desserts are rather pricey\n- Menus are in a weird magazine format which was a little tacky to me\n\nAll in all, a definite try.  A little sweet to my liking - at least for the Okinawa milk tea, but I'll need to try another flavour before I can say for sure - but nonetheless, I hope this place does well!
