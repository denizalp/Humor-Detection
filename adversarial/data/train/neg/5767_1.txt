One of the best shows from Cirque du Soleil. If you like Beatles music, you must do this before any other. The athletes are great and get all over the place. Theres no spot with a thing moving at all times. If you want to appreciate it completely you should buy a ticket in the back or middle. If you want to get the experience and interact with the actors, then you can seat in the front. You can take no flash pictures and have lots of fun. Dress properly. Don't forget to buy souvenirs, they are unique and really cute!
