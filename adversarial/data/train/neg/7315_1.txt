Service is very bad and I try my best to avoid coming here. If I have time I will drive all the way to Spring Mountain. However, sometimes I have no choice and for that I will grudgingly make my emergency purchase and try to leave without paying too attention to the owners. It's surprising - usually mom and pop places are welcoming. Not the case here!
