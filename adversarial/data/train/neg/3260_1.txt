watch out for this company!!!!!! had a problem with one of my AC units not turning off, so i called my home warranty co. (just bought home 1 month ago) and they sent Air One ... the techs name was Truman. i explaned my problem and he went straight to the outside unit and checked the freon. ( when that was not the problem. my house was cold !!!) he tells me im a pound or two short of freon.so said fine. put it in...goes to his truck and i get a call from the office asking me for payment of $525 !!!!!! i asked her why so much when i only needed 1 or 2 pounds, she tells me they have to evacuate the whole system and insert some other gas to find out if there is a leak, and that they do not return the freon that they took out, because they cannot guarantee the freon they took out !!!!! the first red flag should of been when they asked me to pay upfront when , mind you i live in Lake Las vegas not exactly the ghetto.......i walk out to his truck hes sitting in there on the phone with the lady im on the phone with ...and hes waiting for the ok ...from her that i paid !!!! long story short i paid the $75 service call and said Good Bye to Truman, my wife told him she felt she was being extorted.... i called another AC company on my own , not through the warranty co.. i contacted Black Mountain and they sent a tech over, his name was todd, i told hime my problem ... ( he Listened !!!!! ) and within 2 minutes said it was my thermostat . he checked my ac unit that and said it was running fine and that it didnt need anything .. at that time ..i told him what happended with Air One...he shook his head... he didnt even charge me.!!!!!!!! i called them back to install 2 Nest thermostats i bought... they have a customer for life!!!!!!! i called my home warranty co. and told them what Air One did... its almost criminal... i think the term is Fraud !!!!
