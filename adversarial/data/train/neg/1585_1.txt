Fun atmosphere -- the restaurant is on a working garden\/farm and you sit at picnic tables. Great place for breakfast or brunch. It could be brutal if it's hot outside, but when we went (mid-Sept) it felt great in the shade. Portion sizes are large. I had the Farm Omelet with country potatoes and my wife had the Breakfast Sandwich. Both were tasty.
