I've had breakfast at the Sahara location as well as the original San Diego location.  This was a complete let down.  I had high expectations that lunch would be just as great, went BIG, had the bacon cheeseburger... And both fries and burger were COLD..... Not kinda warm... Cold.  Yes, as predictable it was huge, but a disappointment for sure.  Didn't even finish a quarter of it.  The bigger problem, it was true for the whole table of 6.
