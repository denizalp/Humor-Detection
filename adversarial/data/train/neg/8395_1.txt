This airline exists because they fly to small towns, few airlines go to.They have OLD junkie, narrow planes with the most cramped seating imaginable.\n When you call them it takes them 45 minutes or more to pick up so you have to use their terrible internet site .Initial rates low but they have plenty of added on charges,all bags are an extra charge.If you cancel you lose all your money unless you insure your flight.\n  I had an upfront seat but all the overhead compartments were filled so I had to put my bag in back,so I had to wait till the airline emptied to get my bag,I paid extra for my seat which had zero leg room.\nThey run a food cart down the isle 3 times,each time the overweight flight member  elbowed me going down the isle.All food and beverage are expensive so bring your own.One time I paid $22 for a front row seat but had the door pressing against my leg so it didn't really offer extra legroom.\nThis airline is truly rock bottom.There is often delays ,it is nothing to run a half hour late,twice they had AC problems.What is really shocking is how rude\/or short tempered  some of the employees are ,they work for the worst airline in the country YET THEY HAVE A LOT OF  ATTITUDE.What a joke.\n I keep praying someone will buy this airline to bring it up to the standards of other airlines ! Anyone who rates this airline higher than 2 stars obviously doesn't fly much.I have flown out of several cities with Allegiant it is always the same.
