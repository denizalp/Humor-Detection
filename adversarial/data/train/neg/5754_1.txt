This is a fine place. I went in to get my guitar repaired (a Taylor acoustic). The back had split. They fixed it for one-third of the price that I had as an estimate from another guy. I literally cannot see where the back split. \nThis is also an interesting store if you are looking to buy, with some classic electric guitars and nice guys hanging out who like to talk about their stock. Just a great store that really adds something special to our developing neighborhood.
