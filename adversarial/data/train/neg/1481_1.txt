Remember the good old days when you could go Stinkweeds in Tempe next to Pita Jungle and see a band perform live, just hours before it was to take the stage at Marquee Theatre?\n\nSeeing Camper Van Beethoven play live at a local record store is what stands out to me. Then patrons even have the opportunity to chat with the band as they pack their gear. That's simply unheard of. \n\nEven Kimber, the owner, told me of the days when the store had a location in Mesa and sold a bunch of vinyl. \n\nNow, thanks to the ipod generation and illegal downloading of music,  all we're left with is the Phoenix store. The Camelback store has a great collection of obscure music you won't find in other stores. The store also has band stickers you'd be hard pressed to find on the Internet. \n\nI believe Stinkweeds is what Hoodlums aims for but Hoodlums gets local bands to perform there and their selection is far more mainstream. \n\nWorth the drive to central Phoenix to find, say, that German synth pop EBM band that Best Buy will never carry.
