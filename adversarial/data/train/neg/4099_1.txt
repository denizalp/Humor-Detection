I've been using this Von's for over 7 years and literally I tell myself I'm not coming back after each experience. The store is always spotless clean but wow some of the employees are just complete idiots or just plain rude! I usually go on off days just to avoid crowds so it isn't like they are busy. My last bad experience was at the deli counter which is one of the areas that's a problem. Mind you I am the only one standing there the store was very slow. I stand there patiently for about 5 minutes while a young man working there is literally ignoring me. I clear my throat a few times thinking okay maybe he doesn't see me still no help. I honestly was going to walk out when he finally walks over and stares at me but doesn't say can I help you! Now I'm pissed so I just stare back at him uncomfortably now I refuse to say anything until he acknowledges me!! He continues to blankly stare and now I finally blurt out I guess I'll speak first since you obviously can't. I give him my order begrudgingly when he's done he literally threw the bag of cold cuts on top of the counter and walks away!! I honestly can't believe this I should have just left my shopping cart full of food and walked out but my time is valuable. I own two businesses in this town and if I ever caught one of my employees treating a customer in the manner this guy did they would be unemployed real quick. This happened about a month ago and I've been meaning to write a review but I wanted to give the place another shot. And sadly it's still the same not just the deli counter but also the bakery. Employees can be the death of a business and I realize that our new generation of employees mostly feel entitled but wow I honestly have never been treated like this. To all the employees out there that hate your jobs please quit and clean up your attitudes no one owes you anything your paycheck at the end of the week is the only thing you're entitled too.
