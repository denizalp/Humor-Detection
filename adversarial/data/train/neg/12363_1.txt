I've been to Drew's several times, and have always been very satisfied there. The service  has been warm and friendly, and kindness and patience are rewarded in turn.\n\nAs for food, the pizza has a wonderful crust and it tastes like a real labor of love. The pancakes, waffles, french toast, and omelets are all very good.  The newer daily specials and side dish vegetables are especially nice for dinner. \n\nAs an archetypal diner and family restaurant Drew's doesn't have a ton of options for people with dietary restrictions, but with a little careful attention to the menu and help from the friendly staff, everyone should be able to find at least something to eat there.
