We have been to this restaurant many times over the years and had excellent meals.  About 3 years ago, we had such a bad meal, we stayed away.  A couple months ago we thought we'd give it another try.  We had reservations for a booth and arrived 20 minutes ahead of time and were promptly seated.  After we ordered our cocktails, the waitress pushed us to order.  We generally like to enjoy our cocktail before we order our meal.  We were informed that we were only allowed to keep the table for 1 1\/2 hours.  My husband asked for an exception because that was ridiculous.  Since they said no, we decided to enjoy our cocktail for 1 1\/2 hour and eat elsewhere,   My husband engaged in a friendly conversation with another table. The manager came over and told us we had to leave because of this.  I couldn't believe he insisted we leave for talking to another patron, but said if we didn't leave immediately he would call the police. He was nasty and totally disrespectful.\n     Many people try this restaurant because it is an institution in Charlotte, however, this was sold 3 years ago and has a new owner.  That explains why the quality of food and the treatment of patrons has gone down hill.  We have eaten at Morton's, Ruth Chris and other fine restaurants and have never been given a time limit at our table.  Actually expensive restaurants expect people to linger.  This new owner charges high dollar for mediocre food.  He wants to turn tables to make money rather than insuring a great experience for the customer.  he is relying on the long reputation of a previously great restaurant.  I give him a couple of years before the place closes.  I have talked to too many people who had poor food there that won't return.  What a shame.
