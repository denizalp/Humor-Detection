Elias - absolutely phenomenal and kind guy!!! I showed 6min to close (not on purpose swear and literally saw it closing and he took my order anyways!!) he was more than polite and happy to help feed me after an exhausting day of a 14hour shift!!! I left a $10 tip in the jar and still didn't feel like it was enough!  Give him something please!! He's a true leader!!
