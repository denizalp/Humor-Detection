Beautiful place suitable for polished outings. It is perfect for a romantic date or  a business meal. I love the presentation of one page paper menu, it shows you the yummy ingredients and gets your taste bud active. The taste is consistent with high quality ingredients. The location is weird but pleasantly unforgettable. Great Summerlin gem!
