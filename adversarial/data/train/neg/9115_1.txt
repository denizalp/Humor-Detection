Come for the beer selection, stay for the food!  Beer Bistro has a very accessible menu, even for the non-beer drinker.\n\nI had the steak frites which were incredible.  My wife (not a beer drinker) had the cheese & lager fondue and the grilled stuffed chicken breast which were also fantastic.  Overall a great experience.\n\nGreat, friendly service with a very knowledgeable staff.  The staff are passionate about their jobs in general and beer in particular.  They can make some great beer recommendations for you.
