In my opinion the best wine, beer and liquor store (super store) in the Madison area. I would have given it a 5 but it didn't have an Australian or New Zealand wine section that I could find. Europe has several isles and Japan has its own section. I'm sure those wines are buried in there somewhere in the regular wine section. Massive selection of red and white wines, beers from all around the world and a large liquor section. I do like higher end wines and one of my favs is Silver Oak, Napa. It does run a little higher price here than other local retailers. Wine tasting was going on during my visit but I was on my way to other places and couldn't have a taste. I would recommend coming here for alcohol. They just need to open one on the east side of Madison\/Sun Prairie.
