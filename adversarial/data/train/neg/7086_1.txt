The Carriage Park Apartments are too expensive for the poor infrastructure you are living in.  The leasing office is extremely unhelpful and have poor follow-up\/communication with tenants. The maintenance crew is quick but not all problems can be resolved. I have had three water damage and mold damage incidents in the 10 months I have lived at Carriage Park. \n\nThese are unacceptable living standards. I absolutely do not recommend anyone to move into these apartments.
