Awesome place to eat! I ordered the truffle portabello burger with garlic fries and was MORE than satisfied. the burger was a perfect medium rare, nice and juicy with a ton of flavor. Nate was an awesome server, extremely personable, and if you get the bottomless mimosas, he will make sure you get your moneys worth!
