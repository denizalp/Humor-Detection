Absolutely love these guys! Have bought more than a few trucks from Mike Bock and the process is always fast & simple. Completely different experience than dealing with a big box dealership, especially when it comes to financing. They sell a lot of cars so their inventory is constantly new. Plus if they don't have it, Mike can get it. I just purchased a Ram 1500 for work and I'll back when I need another vehicle.
