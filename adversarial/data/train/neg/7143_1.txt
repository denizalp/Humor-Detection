Great concept (no table service here - each person on his\/her own). Fast and fresh. Chaotic and confusing.\n\nYou get all of that here. There are signs posted above the food stations, but no one directing newbies in how to place an order nor are there distinct lines for people to wait in. If it's busy, you just wait in a lump of people hoping you're not cutting someone off and that you're in the right line. \n\nStand behind the sign where you want to order that particular item. If you want to order a carne asada street taco and a burrito, yes, you have to stand and wait in two separate lines.\n\nBesides the chaos, the food service was impressive. They make the food right in front of you on a hot grill. The street corn on a stick was generously buttered and seasoned, and the burritos were as big as Chipotle's. They expedite your order so you don't have to wait too long. The salsa station has a good variety of mild, medium, and hot sauces.\n\nThere is plenty of seating throughout. So elbow your way to the front of the line, grab your food, then grab a seat and enjoy.
