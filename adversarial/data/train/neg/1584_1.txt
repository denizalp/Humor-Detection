Amazing prices - outstanding customer service. Don't let the little storefront in a sort of ghetto strip mall fool you. Superior quality  on lenses, also. Renee helped me and is fantastic. I came here after being told my buy one get one deal at Visionworks would cost me over $600. Walked out of here with FOUR pairs for less than that. Awesome.
