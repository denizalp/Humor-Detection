Location- Great! Tequila- Great! Taco Tuesday Deal- Great! Food- Ok. \n\nI would go here for the convenience, desirable location, and value. I will update this review after I go a second time as maybe the night I went was just an off night but I did not enjoy the fajitas that I ordered. Everything else lines up for a great evening in southend and maybe that is what it should be utilized for, location, location, location.  I'm giving it a 3 because of all the other factors that play into this review and my overall experience.
