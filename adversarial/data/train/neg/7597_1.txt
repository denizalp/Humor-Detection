Horrible service we waited 30mins to be able to order our food. Our waiter seem to forget everything even us when it came to food or just simple things like to go boxes. We received horrible service. Food was good but if James is your waiter run. He was extremely erratic and forgetful. Also acknowledged it numerous times which you figure he would have got it together horrible experience would not recommend.
