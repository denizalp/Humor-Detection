Haven't been here for dinner, but their lunch sushi buffet is very fun and very filling.  Sometimes it does get so busy that some of the sushi put out is gone in seconds, but you just have to time your trips to the bar accordingly - and also size up the competition on the other tables [nothing that a flying elbow to the face couldn't fix - j\/k].\n\nWith other sushi places opening up in Charlotte, it will be interesting to see how Ru San's stacks up against the newbies to the QC.
