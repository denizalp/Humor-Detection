Yes  this place is awesome. I had Tranquility apartment, which was first level, but protected from sun. Place was clean, I had everything I wanted to start there- they have pots, pans, plates, glasses. All you need is your food and cooking oil, sugar and salt.\nI was very happy. They offer free cable included in price. Nice quiet place quite tranquil. Very secure. I love it every minute. Our manager Adam Sanchez was awesome and answered to all our e-mails in minutes. Great place believe me.
