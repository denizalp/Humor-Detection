I've only been here once but my first time there was tasty! \n\nI could eat breakfast all day, every day and N Counter hit the spot. My man and I ordered two soy lattes, Banana Walnut Pancakes and the Farmers Market Bene. SO delicious!! The pancakes were decadent and the Farmers Market was just the right amount of flavor and spice with a little addiction of Cholula. Food was cooked well and despite how busy it was we didn't wait forever for our meal. \n\nWe enjoyed a nice spot out on the patio enjoying the sun. N Counter is in the heart of Tempe and  close to A Mountain as well as little shops and a movie theater. Get a quick hike in before you grab a delicious breakfast at N Counter!
