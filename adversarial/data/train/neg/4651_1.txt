Excellent food. Charning atmosphere. Friendly staff. Cute bar attached. The chips are homemade-as is most everything else. Great prices, great portions. Well done margaritas and plenty of veggie options. Please note they do *not* use lard AND they are open 7 days a week. Some searches will tell you otherwise.\nChalupas and Chili Rellenios are recommended!
