Best AYCE in Toronto. Their sushi is very fresh and they use real Japanese soy sauce instead of the cheap Chinese stuff. Though must admit that I missed the old sushi island (before they sold it and changed the name to New Sushi Island). They used to have soft shell crabs on their AYCE menu. Now I can only get that through their spider rolls.
