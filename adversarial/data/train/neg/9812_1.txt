There are few things in life I like more than pizza. This is a neat little joint to get it from. From the outside, it looks like a cruddy little place, but the pizza is amazing. Incredibly underrated pizza joint with competitive pricing. The crust was golden brown and it tasted exactly like a Brooklyn pizzeria. The only dislike I have is the environment. No tables to sit down and a little dingy inside. However the food was great, the staff was friendly and it was fast. Would definitely recommend.
