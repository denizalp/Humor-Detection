I used to love Encanto but whether it is the economy and job cutbacks or what, this place is really run down.  I was there just one year ago and it appeared that they were renovating and putting some effort into improving the place.  But one year later, nothing is completed and the place is run down.  The water is green and gross and smelly.  The bathrooms run down.  We went to a company picnic, they have food service as part of the package with the wristbands for the Enchanted Island rides.  The cookies were stale, the burgers and hot dogs were tasteless but just the general condition of the park was sad.  I don't think we'll have another company picnic there as everyone was complaining.  If someone could help run this place better, it could be a beautifully nostalgic place to go with the family.
