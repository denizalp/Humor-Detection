Resumed: nice and clean Hotel in direct Airport approach\n\nNot a big deal: clean, mostly friendly, nice suited rooms\n\nWhat else you expect when you are just need a place to sleep. Breakfast is simple and solid (enough to fast feed your hungering stomach) but not a delicious choice\n\nGood address to start your Nevada tour if you came along late from your flights towards US. But that's it....I would choose for a Las Vegas Strip trip always some of the Casino Hotels....from here (La Quinta) you need a car or a cab to approach the inner circle location.\n\nFor me not important- but sensitively sleepers could have an issue with the direct surrounded takeoff and arriving airplanes......
