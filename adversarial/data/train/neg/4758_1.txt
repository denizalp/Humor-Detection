I finally made my way to the new farmer's market and am I ever glad I battled through the Saturday afternoon crowd. \n\n\"The Juliet\" is SOOOOOOO good, I couldn't stop eating it. At $10 per package, I was a little leery. But the sausages are MASSIVE, not greasy at all, and delicious. Well worth the money. I can't wait to try the other 2 flavours I bought.
