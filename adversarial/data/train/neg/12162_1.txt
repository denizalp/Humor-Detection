Okay the BYOB is fun but it's all about the good tacos here. I ordered the carne asada, barbacoa, and al pastor, a side of guacamole, and washed it down with horchata. My meal was very good. The meat was perfectly cooked, the chips were crisp, the tortillas were soft, and the guacamole actually tasted like ripe avocados. The only thing I wasn't a fan of was the salsa but I think it's a flavor profile and heat preference that I'm not a fan of. Overall 5 out of 5.
