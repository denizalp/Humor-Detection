i dont usually leave reviews but came across peters detailing service and thought id give him a try. I called him up and set up an appointment for a full detail on my BMW E60 M5. I needed the car detailed earliest possible, he was able to set up for the following morning no problems. the next morning he confirmed with me that he will be meeting me at my condo on time and come to find out that i had misplaced my keys he was able to push back my appointment and went to work on another job. shortly after i found my keys and he came right on down. i gave him the keys and him and his buddy went to straight to work. they took about 3 hours total to complete the job when i came back down i was amazed at the work that they did. my car hasn't been washed in over a month was very dirty due to the weather out here and when they were done with it, it look just like new. full clay bar, wash, wax, steam clean entire interior and conditioned everything. peter was even nice enough to wash my entire engine bay came out looking brand new. i was very pleased with the work they had done and i highly recommend them you wont be disappointed. very nice and knowledgeable guys. i will use there service in the future for all my cars.
