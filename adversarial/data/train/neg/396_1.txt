It was really nice when my family and I got there. It wasn't really busy.  But the wait after 10 mins we were there and it got really busy. We waited for our food about 30 mins.  The staff was well organized and very speedy to get the food out. After we waited and got our food, the cook did an excellent job. It was delicious. However, if you do have little toddlers it wouldn't be the greatest place to take them. No kids menu.
