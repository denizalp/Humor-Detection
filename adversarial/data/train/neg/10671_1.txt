I recall reading about Douce France a while ago, not necessarily for their croissants, but for their chocolates.  But within that article I recalled that Douce France made croissants too.  So while I was running errands in the area, I made the hubby go in and pick up some croissants to try.  These croissants were amazing!  Light and flakey and full of buttery goodness!  I'm pretty sure that it partly had to do with them being fresh from the oven as well.    I wish that I lived closer so I could eat these croissants whenever I wanted.  But I'm sure my pants love that I live that far away.
