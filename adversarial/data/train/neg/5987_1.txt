Tried it a month ago for the first time when I wanted to try something near work and then got hooked. Very good food and excellent staff and service. Now I am there any chance I get. tried many Greek restaurants around Montreal and New York city and this one is one of the best if not the best amongst them so far as far as casual Greek restaurants go.
