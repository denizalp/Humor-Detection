We came here on a Sunday evening for dinner. We were seated right away on their awesome patio. There is a great selection of beers and I love the 'school' theme! The food was amazing and they have a lot of interesting options. We got the bison burger with quinoa salad, bangers and mash and the ice cream sandwich with bacon for dessert. Our waiter, Zo, was especially helpful and offered a lot of advice on what we would like. He definitely sold us on the dessert and it was well worth it. We can't wait to come back!!
