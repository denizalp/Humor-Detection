Dogfish Pub & Eatery is close to the house we're renting while visiting Toronto so we gave it a shot last night (Saturday). I'm SO happy we did! They offer great views of the lake and boats coming in to dock. The owner and staff were super nice and the service was great. The pub is immaculately clean, which is a huge thing with me. We shared pulled pork dirty poutine, calamari, and a fried fish dinner. Everything was perfect. And the portions are huge. They have a nice selection of local craft beers, and Cuban rum, a treat for us Americans. A true highlight of our trip! Thank you, Jon and Lisa for making us feel at home.
