I brought my 3 month old daughter in due to wheezing and coughing. I'm a mother of 6, but having a 10 lb. baby struggling to breathe is a nerve-wracking situation. My almost 3 year old accompanied us and  got to work playing in the waiting room while I filled out the paperwork. We were taken back to a room quickly and the male nurse who assisted us gave my son some stickers to keep him busy. The doctor came in after a short 15 minutes and was so compassionate and warm. He eased my fears and explained that she had a viral infection, and told me how to help her be more comfortable without giving her any unnecessary medications. He really took his time with us and never once tried to rush to the next patient. This urgent care is about 25 miles out of the way for me but I will be bringing my kids back here if I ever have the need. (Let's hope not!) By far the best experience I've had in 13 years as a mother!
