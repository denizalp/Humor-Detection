Went here yesterday to get a manicure before a concert. I wanted a matte black finish. I was late to my appointment by 10 mins due to traffic and they were fine with this. I was seated immediately and they got to work. \n\nHe asked me want kind of shape I wanted on my nails and suggested square (which now looks kinda funny on natural nails but whatever). What does bug me is that he filed down the surface of my nails which left all these visible bumps once the polish went on. I don't know why this was necessary, and he did it without asking (I didn't get shellac for those wondering, just plain old nail polish). The place was clean, and he worked quickly. I would go back again, but I didn't get the smooth matte finish I was after.
