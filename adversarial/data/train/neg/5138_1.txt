Always a great time here and definitely a place worthwhile to visit if you are ever visiting Toronto and are in the annex area. There are TONs of boardgames here and they are organized very well across several bookshelves - there is literally a boardgame for everyone and you will definitely find something to your liking. The boardgames are also very well maintained (eg. cards are laminated, boardgame pieces are organized into small bags). \n\nThe food and drinks here are decent and are reasonably priced. I always end up getting a tea. \n\n+ The flat fee to play here is $6.00\n+ Free wifi!\n+ They serve alcohol! Alcohol and boardgames - great combination\n+ They close at midnight most days. They close at 2am on Saturdays
