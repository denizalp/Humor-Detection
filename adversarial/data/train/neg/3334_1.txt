We were seeing Cirque du Soleil show at TI, so for proximity we decided to try out the Buffet at Treasure Island.  There was no wait, and the price is inexpensive.  They also offer Children price so it was helpful.  There was no expensive or fancy stuff at the Buffet - just pasta, pizza, ice cream, and different types of BBQs.  For all meat lovers (like me), the different types of BBQs (like pulled pork, ribs, smoked meats, etc) were just great, with different types of BBQ sauce.  The BBQ meats were all juicy and flavorful.  I don't really miss prime ribs when I get to chow on mountains of delicious BBQ pork.  They also had cotton candy - great for my daughter.  There weren't any fancy desserts, but ice cream and whatever other cakes they had were good enough for us.\nThe service was also friendly.\nWhile I consider Wynn to have the best quality, TI has the best value overall.  I would definitely go back again.
