I went there on Aug.4. \nMy first impression was not very good. I had to wait quite a while for the greeter and even asked a server if I should seat myself. The server called the greeter over and I noted she had been standing by the bar the whole while and was just ignoring us. Guess she was checking her huge false eyelashes and that was more important than customers.LOL\nWe were not asked if we wanted a booth or a table or offered an apology for the wait.\nNot a great start.\nHowever, the bartender came right over and proceeded to give us incredible service even though we had not been seated anywhere near the bar.\nThe food was tasty and came out quickly and was hot.\nI had the chicken shrimp noodle bowl and recommend it if you like that sort of dish. The wine and dessert selections were more than adequate.
