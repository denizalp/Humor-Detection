Getting stuck for tests really stinks. Having to do it in the doctor's office is bad enough. Having to drive - or walk, if you are close enough to do so - to another place entirely is like a slap in the face.\n\nBut the staff here is friendly, if perhaps a bit overwhelmed at times. They process your paperwork, like every other medical place on the planet, you sit, they stick you, take your blood (as much as is needed), and you are on your way, sooner or later.
