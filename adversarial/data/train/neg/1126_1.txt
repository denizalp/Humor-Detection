Probably on of the most business station in the system, it connect the yonge line with bloor or vice versa depending on where you are coming from. The yonge platform is more spacial then bloor platform and it does get packed for room\n\nIt has washrooms and a convenience store for a quick stop over but you can find what you need by leaving the station since it in heart of Toronto. Connecting the core with midtown. and even East York\/Danforth\n\nThe crowd are pain to deal with but this is the ttc and toronto. You use the subway enough you know what you have deal with.
