The atmosphere is great, esp. if you're a student. The coffee was terrific (and you can buy the brand, fair-trade, to take home) but some of the food was a bit meh. However, the desserts are to die for. I love that you can take bags of biscotti home. \n\nBut seriously, people, if you're going to sit all day, at least buy a meal or two.\n\nAgree with earlier comments on wifi speed: free and available, nice, but iffy on the speed.
