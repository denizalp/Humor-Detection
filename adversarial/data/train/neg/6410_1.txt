Yelp Challenge! Started 8\/20\/2011 (32 of 365). I have a lot of catching up to do!\n\nI'm sorry fellow Yelpers, but I was hugely disappointed.  After reading everyones reviews I was excited when I finally had the chance to try this place.  I was so hungry but not even that gave me a reason to rave about the taste and quality of the food.\n\nI ordered the combination plate with a grilled fish taco, and a carne asada enchilada.  My plate came with black beans and white rice (even though I specifically asked for brown).  Everything on my plate was bland except for the mild green salsa which I'll have to say was the only good part of my meal.  I had to dip everything into this salsa to get a good taste out of anything on my plate.  The grilled fish taco had no taste at a;;!  The fish was a thick piece, and because it was o thick, it's bland taste took over the entire taco.  It was dry, and disappointing.  The carne asada enchilada I had was mediocre because the meat inside was chewy and in addition, difficult to chew down and swallow!  I was questioning how old the beef is or if they cooked it too long.  I like my beef to be tender!\n\nI was really upset that my experience turned out the way that it did.  I guess I'm used to the authenticity of some other mexican food joints.  But even the american infused ones such as Rubios taste way better than the food here.\n\nI do give it a couple stars for the bar they hav in there w\/ video poker and TVs to watch your favorite sports.  They also have daily drink specials which is pretty cool too.
