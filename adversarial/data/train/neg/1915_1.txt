My wife and I went to John Cutter in Summerlin last night as we had a Groupon to use. We'd been there before so we knew what to expect. Except this time they had a singer playing guitar just inside the front door. We hadn't seen that before. In truth this place is too small to have live music. Even if we enjoyed the musician, which we didn't, it would have been too loud to allow reasonable dinner conversation. Given the total lack of attention and applause , it didn't seem like the other patrons appreciated the entertainment either.\nThe sandwiches we ordered were good and the service was surprisingly good as well which had not been our experience in past visits. Normally you have to set a trap or throw a net to get the waitress's attention to refill an ice tea but last night service was better. You still had to ask for a refill but it actually came quickly after asking.\nGiven average food, fair service and the new loud live entertainment, we won't be back until outdoor patio dining is appropriate, if then.
