so I came here at 7 in the morning surprisingly not hung over but overly exhausted from the night prior.\nSo on the weekends brunch is a wowzing $29. Personally found that a tad outrageous but still they do offer endless mamosas so who can really say no to that.\n\nSo I get in for breakfast at 8, someone takes my order and off to the bar I go, I'm carded naturally being 22.\n\nNext is the make your own omelet station which I was very pleased with. My server was quite kind and gave me loads of advice on whether or not I should visit Zion national park or not. The end all decision is a yes and I'm absolutely stoked about it.\n\nI have to admit the staff here pays very close attention to you and I respect MGM for that. Next stop is the Bellagio!
