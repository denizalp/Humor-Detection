I have made only one visit here, but I was impressed with the service and surprised by the quality of the food. Yes, this is a fast food place (or the  technical term is \"quick service\") and I would not try to convince anyone that it is something more. However, I ate at the Carl's Jr in the Vegas airport waiting for a flight to YYC and the food was somewhere south of good.\n\nThe McLeod Tr location was a different story. I ordered a Big Carl that arrived quickly. It was hot, fresh and flavourful. Fries were also hot and crisp. The Big Carl matched any of my other fave burgers from 5 Guys or Fat Burger.
