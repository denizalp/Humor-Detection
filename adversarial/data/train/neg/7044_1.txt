I bought a $40 for $20 Dealfind coupon for Fuji Yama towards the beginning of the year and finally decided to cash it in. The benefit of the coupon was that I felt like I could try things I hadn't before without feeling like I'd wasted too much money if I didn't like them.\n\nLet me tell you - Octopus sushi? Not my thing.\n\nWe ended up spending about $20 on top of the coupon anyhow, with the order of sake to end the meal. The only disadvantage was the Sunday special on sake didn't apply because we were using the coupon. It might have been nice if they'd mentioned it when we ordered.\n\nAll in all, Fuji Yama was pretty good - fairly well aligned with the prices. It probably won't be my default go-to place but I'd go again if a friend suggested it.
