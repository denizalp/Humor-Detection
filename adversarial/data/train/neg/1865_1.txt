Stopped by for lunch with a friend. I had a chicken bento box and it was fantastic. The portions were great for lunch, and I still too food home with me! It came with a salad, miso soup, teriyaki chicken, steamed rice, shrimp and vegetable tempura, and 4 pieces of California roll. It was way too much for me, but for 9.00 it was a great deal.\n\nThe staff were very friendly and the service was great.
