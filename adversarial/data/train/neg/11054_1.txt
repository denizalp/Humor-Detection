Staff is fantastic!  They know how to make an excellent espresso.  The atmosphere is comfortable, free wi-fi.  Cell phone reception is very poor inside the building, but then you don't have to listen to others talking on their phones.  They really personalize the experience compared to chain coffee houses.
