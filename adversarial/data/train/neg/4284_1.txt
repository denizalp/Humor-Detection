The drinks were good but the service was slow.  Our waitress she seemed very busy and arrogant, hardly came back to check with us, five of us had to waive like crazy to draw her attention because she wouldn't look at us at all!\n\nHowever, besides our \"busy\" waitress, the bust-boy, the manager, they were all very nice and helpful.  The bust-boy even tried to help us get our waitress, of coz he failed, i really think our waitress was avoiding us!  Why?  5 of us ordered 2 rounds of drinks in less than an hour.  I dont think we were the bad customers rite? So why being such a B?\n\nThe live performing was very entertaining but it could be loud.  But I love it!
