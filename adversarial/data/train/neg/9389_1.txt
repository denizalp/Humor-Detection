I'm so glad to see this place is successful, so I don't have to feel bad about avoiding it. When they opened up, they were trying so hard. My husband and I had a coffee there and it was an awkward, weird experience. A poor costumed (French?) teenager had to serve us the coffee and bring us a bottle of water. It seemed forced and cringe-inducing. They have excellent products though, and I wish them the best.
