My husband and I had the opportunity to have dinner here for a second time last weekend. We had a completely different experience! I ordered Llewelyn's chicken & skillet cornbread & grits. My husband ordered ribs and burnt ends. We finished our meal with peach cobbler....soooo yummy... & I enjoyed the house Pinot as I did on my last trip.\n\nThe chicken batter was light and flavorful. The chicken itself was juicy and moist! The grits were excellent. They were thick, hardy and flavorful! Soooo good! They came out fresh and piping hot. The cornbread was all kinds of good! Sweet, hot & fresh! The perfect side for fried chicken. Fresh butter served on the side . I definitely splurged and put plenty on top of my cornbread!\n\nMy husband loved his burnt ends and ribs! I tried a bite of each and I was in heaven. Smokey and moist! No complaints from either of us.\n\nThe service is what really blew me away! We had the opportunity to meet a few of The managers who went above & beyond to make sure that we had a good visit. Our server was outstanding! So friendly and attentive.\n\nI'm so glad that we went back for a second time! Looking forward to trying CHICA on our next trip to Vegas! These folks are definitely a class act and go above and beyond to ensure a wonderful customer experience. Well done, Yardbird!
