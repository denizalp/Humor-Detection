Arrived at a busy time. Host told us that it would be about a half hour to 45 minutes. We were seated in 12 minutes in a table by floor to ceiling windows. We had the crispy pork belly as an appetizer and it was just okay. My companion's pizza pie arrived about 10 minutes before my entree. Because of this mis-timing, I got a piece of the sausage and mushroom delight. The crust was perfect, the sauce was robust and the sausage was incredible. My short rib ragu arrived and kept me from another piece of pie. The ragu was rich and delightful. Because of the mis-timed meals, we were offered a complimentary dessert. We had the apple upside down tart and a hazelnut cake. Both were delectable.  Some minor service issues but the food is gourmet. Thanks, Patrick and staff for a great dining experience.
