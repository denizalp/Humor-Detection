Way too much money for their services - $60 before tip for a gel manicure. I was told it would last 2-3 weeks, it lasted about one week. The quality of the job wasn't great. \nThe staff were nice, place was clean.\nOne of the aestheticians started talking about how bad the gel manicure is for your nails while I was sitting right beside her getting it done, which was awkward.
