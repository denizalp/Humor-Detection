We've stayed at this Hilton a couple of times; once was on business. The rooms are decent size although the bathrooms were slightly small. \nMy youngest loved the pool area with the slide; great for kids especially on a warm summer day.\nThe food is better than average compared to most other hotels. \nIt is just a short 15 minute drive away from Pearson airport for anyone wanting to stay within a close drive\/cab ride to the airport.
