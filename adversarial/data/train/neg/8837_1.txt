What an amazing salon ! I have had some really bad issues with my hair and a bad set of extensions that were put in that caused me to lose a lot of my hair volume.  Hillary has went above and Beyond trying to help me with the process of getting my hair back. Very patient, understanding and genuinely concerned! Hillary is really great at cutting hair too. Decor of the salon is adorable , which is a bonus :-)
