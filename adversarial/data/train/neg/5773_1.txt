Nothing special here ( and there are locations all around Cleveland). Even the newer location on the west side on Detroit Road (may be in Westlake) is cut from the same mold.\n\nToo many TVs, fake signs all over the place, average food and high prices. Fairly good selection of beers and you can sign up for one of their jackets if you really want to go to the same place far too many times to qualify.\n\nOkay place to stop for a beer and a sandwich but Cleveland has too many places that are much better withing 3 or 4 miles.
