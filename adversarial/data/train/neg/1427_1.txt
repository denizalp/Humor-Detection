Maybe the worst BBQ I've ever had.  The chicken tenders in my daughter's meal were too salty to eat.  My ribs were tasteless and the chicken dry.    My wife's wings were over fried and over salted.   The only thing any of us had that was good were the BBQ beans.   Save your money.   You'd be better off with a McRib.
