I'm getting married in August, and I was debating whether I wanted a veil at all. My dress is white with black embellishments, and I really wanted a black veil, but I hated all the thicker black ones I saw online... cheap-looking and Hot-Topic esque, I felt.\n\nBut then I found a photo on Pinterest of a bride with an incredibly thin black veil in the sheerest, most delicate tulle I've ever seen, and I adored it. I miraculously tracked it down as having been made by Cleo & Clementine, so I reached out to them and asked them about the possibility of making one for me. I actually assumed it would be way more expensive than it was, but the price (~$300 for cathedral length) was within my range. They worked with me via email to create my custom order, and it finally arrived tonight! \n\nMy dress is also being custom made, so I don't have it yet, and therefore don't have any way of knowing how the veil with look paired with my dress. I imagine, though, that it will be perfect. It's the exact fabric I asked for, and I can't wait to see the end result. I'll definitely return to post photos after my wedding day!
