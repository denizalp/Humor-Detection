Ordered a classic with jalape√±o Havarti on whole wheat and sat by the window awaiting my burger.\nIt was grilled, the bun was fresh, the Parliament view was interesting and it was less than $10. \nI would return, although the patty was a bit smaller than I anticipated. Still, good burger, sits in my Top 5 upon first visit.
