Not what we were hoping for from the reviews.  This was our first and probably only visit so we may have come on a bad day.  The good- service was excellent and attentive.  The desserts are massive, with apple turnovers the size of your head and cake slices that are easily enough to feed 3-4 persons.\n\nThe bad - the entrees were just not good.  The open faced beef sandwich had thin dry roast beef (almost jerky) covered in a gravy so thick and floury that you couldn't eat it without lots of water.  The vegetable soup was tomato based but tasted like Campbell's or Progresso that had been heavily peppered.  Except for the salads, the rest of the meal was pretty rough.  I see a lot of good reviews so it may just be the timing but I don't know that we are going to try this place again.
