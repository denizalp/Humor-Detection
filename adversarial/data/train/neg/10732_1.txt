Love this place, it has become one of our go to restaurants for Mexican food. They have a huge tequila list but the $3 house margaritas are better than most and for that price I stick to those. Their chili verde is excellent, the tacos, enchiladas, beans, salsa, are all very good and the chili relleno is one of the best I have ever had. So hard to find really good ones!!  The only thing I have had that was so-so and I won't order here again (better elsewhere) is the albondigas soup. Also they give 20% all food orders to seniors on Thursdays. Wahoo!!
