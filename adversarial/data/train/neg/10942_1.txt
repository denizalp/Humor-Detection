Amazing.  We stopped here looking to try a different coffee shop.  Used to Starbucks.  This place is awesome.  I ordered an iced chai and morning bun.  We asked for a knife to cut it in half.  They offered to cut it for us and warmed it up.  The coffee was delicious.  They have our business.  Hard to find a gem like this one.  They have wine and little gifts plus all sorts of food.  Yum!
