My boyfriend and I were celebrating my recent job promotion and our two year anniversary. I must say that the service is what will bring me back again for other celebrations. We had a wonderful server, and were greeted by the manager who congratulated us. The ambiance is very nice for special occasions and anniversaries, however if you wanted to catch the football game or baseball game, you could eat at the bar area. The noise from the bar area does not carry into the fine dining area. \n\nWe both ordered a Caesar salad, the filet mignon and lobster tail, and for dessert we shared the chocolate lava cake AND the cheesecake. Their prices are fair - it's a fine dining establishment. The filet mignon was cooked exactly how I wanted it, and the lobster was delicious. Needless to say, I will be looking forward to celebrating at this Fleming's again.
