Mooyah has been hit or miss for me. I will start off by saying that the service has always been excellent, especially for a fast food place. They are polite and helpful at the ordering counter, and they even come out to check on you while you're eating.  I've been to this location 3 times now.  First time, I wasn't pleased with the food. The burger was way too greasy and I found the metal trays the food was served on to be dirty like they hadn't washed them between customers. However on my most recent two trips, I noticed everything was cleaner and the burger was even better as well.  Also, their strawberry milkshake -- yum.
