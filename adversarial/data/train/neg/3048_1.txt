I'm so glad I found this place, thanks yelpers! Definitely worth checking out, just don't go at lunchtime because it's super busy with nearby business people. Stop in earlier in the day or for late lunch or dinner. The staff is super friendly and they have lots of deals. Their tech is on point, you can put just your name in their system and get a freebie for your birthday. If you download their app, you can order ahead, access secret menu items, ultra customize your order and get other deals. Plus, the food is def on point! I've only had the carne tacos and tacos al pastor but both were fantastic. Their green sauce is top notch and you can't go wrong with the horchata or Jamaica. Plus, since it's inside a gas station there's every kind of drink or snack you could want with it. Amazing!
