Went for lunch this past Wednesday just after noon. My sandwich had avocado and it wasn't until my second last bite that I discovered it was rotten and black and slimey. I took a piece of the avocado to a man who presented as the 'manager' and he didn't seem at all concerened barely uttering a response of any sort to me. When I pressed him to check his current avocado stock to ensure they were fresh, he brushed it off and offeree me a replacement sandwich. I just ate. He gave no apology and no sense that it mattered. Will never go back for Slimy, Black, Rotten Food.
