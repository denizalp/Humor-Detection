A great place to just relax and read some books. The  staff (an old couple probably) don't disturb you when ur reading or just browsing the books, but when you ask them to look for some book, they are really nice and helpful. Quiet and cozy place to stay away from the noisy world outside. Always can find some little surprises between the shelves.
