The place was busy and I feel sorry for the three servers who had to manage it.  That said, everything was substandard: a foul-tasting ceasar (bad tomato juice, cheap vodka?), an uninspired draft beer (dirty lines?), very greasy deep-fried mushrooms, a humdrum tofu patty, so-so fries ... they must've been doing something right at some point because the place was very busy ... pity the servers, who clearly were working very hard to accommodate the crowd.
