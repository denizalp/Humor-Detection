Food: 5\/5. BEST. SALAD. IVE. EVER. HAD. There was just enough, it wasn't too much or overwhelming. Flavor combinations were AMAZING. \n\nAtmosphere: 5\/5. Really nice. Quaint, cool, seating is outdoor, beautiful, lots of families. \n\nService: 5\/5. If it's your first time they'll guide you through ordering. Very friendly. Food came at a reasonable yet borderline long time. But the taste made up for it.
