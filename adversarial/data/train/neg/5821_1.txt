I called The UPS Store on Dec 23 at 4:00 PM to get info about getting a business PO box for a company based in CA\n\nAngie had everything set up for me via e-mail within the hour!!!\nShe was helpful, thorough and efficient (if she was in LA I would have hired her to manage our customer service in a heart beat!)\n\nAngie is an incredible asset to this branch!
