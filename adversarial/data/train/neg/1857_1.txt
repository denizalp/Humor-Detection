Your sales rep interrupted our evening at our home close to 9p and refused to leave to try and sell us a system which I made clear I had no interest in and repeatedly told him we were in the middle of a movie. What type of people are you hiring to represent your company and try to force them into something by not leaving ones property? If he comes to again I'm calling the local police. I will also be warning our neighborhood of this person on Nextdoors forums. This was very rude and inconsiderate - he was misleading and said there was something serious to get be to keep speaking with him.
