First summerlicious my gf and I visited was at La Mesa. The restaurant was known Filipino food fused with western flavours. As a filipino, I have always thought our food is greasy and rich. Visiting to La Mesa this was my expectation. I was glad to be delightfully surprised. Had the sisig rice for the app. Sisig was served with a fried egg and an aioli sauce on top. It was nice and crispy with the aioli balancing the fatty taste of the pig's head and gizzard. Had the milk fish for the main. Milk fish can be quite dry. This was quite moist and had the vinegary taste. Definitely took me back to my childhood as we used to eat this as breakfast food. Finished it off with ube flan topped with tapioca and rice crispies. That was a great dessert. Smooth, velvety, creamy with an amazing purple yam flavor. This was definitely one of the best desserts i've had. Summerlicious is meant for us to taste different restaurants to entice people in coming back. La Mesa definitely succeeded in doing this. Can't wait to go back for another meal.
