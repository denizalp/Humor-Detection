Upon the suggestion of a friend of mine, I recently went to Sea Witch for fish and chips after work. The restaurant is fairly small, with seating for about 2-dozen people; the front half is taken up by the serving counter and an open kitchen where the food is prepared as you order. Everything is clean and the servers are friendly, but the service did seem a bit slow, even considering the restaurant was full at the time. I ordered the pickerel and chips, and while it was good and not too greasy, I don't think it was up to the expectations I had. My food didn't come with the coleslaw that I thought came with all meals, so I missed that, but the portion was certainly large enough. My total bill was $23, including $7 being a bit much for one domestic beer.\n\nOverall, I wasn't sure how I would rate this visit based on my (maybe too) high expectations, so I think I will go back with an open mind to try again.\nStay tuned for an updated review...
