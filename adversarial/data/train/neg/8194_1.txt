This is a terrific little place.  The gelato is great, but the location is better.  It is at the end of the Esplanade at the Wynn.  When we were in there one Thursday evening in late July the place was virtually empty, with the exception of a lovely young couple and their three kids.  The couple was Andre Agassi and Stefanie Graf.  It was fun watching their familiy interacting and thoroughly enjoying themselves.  Their kids were having an absolutely great time.   By the way,  I highly recommend the chocolate shakes.
