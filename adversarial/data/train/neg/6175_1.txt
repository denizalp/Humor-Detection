We were excited to see a new addition to downtown Chandler and eager to give this place a try. After being seated promptly on a slow Tuesday night, we were given water and bread, then ignored for at least 15 minutes. Our waitress was not to be seen and the other waiters didn't make an effort to check on us or offer to take even our drink orders. We ended up walking out and enjoying a lovely dinner around the corner at Latitude 8.
