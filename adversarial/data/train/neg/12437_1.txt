Went here when it first opened (they were setting up the banners at the front the day we were there) because we thought the dressed up eggs in the window were quite cute.  After we were seated and saw the menu we realized that the place was a complete carbon copy of Cora's.  \n\nMany of the dishes were the same as Cora's, even the presentation was the same, lots of fruit on the plate, toast in baskets etc.  In fact, everything seemed so Twilight Zone Cora's that we thought maybe, just maybe they were owned by Cora's.  \n\nIn the end, I felt like the place was a bit of a poser-at least differentiate yourself somehow other than the cute eggs dressed up in the window.  If you go to Cora's or here-it'll be the same meal for about the same price.
