I have ordered from the Ballantyne location several times, and for the most part I am always satisfied. I have only dined in twice, both the service and food were fast and friendly. I usually order delivery and On a few occasions, (not many) my order was incorrect (something not delivered or wrong). But what sets them apart from many other places is their management. They always make it right, he takes ownership and fix the issues. I am a consumer that can love something but if I am not treated right my business and money will go elsewhere. So with good food and service I will always be a customer. This is what you call getting right! If you are looking for good New York style pizza, this is definitely the spot.
