I love this place! Very luxurious and elegant. If your staying here, get one of the suites. The bed was plush. Bathroom was fit for a Queen. Couldnt have asked for a better hotel. \n\nUpdate: I stayed here again for my bachelorette party and couldn't of been happier. Tao beach was lots of fun. Our suite was perfect and the view was amazing.\nThe gondola ride is a must if you have 15 minutes to spare.
