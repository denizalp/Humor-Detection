LOCATION: \nLocation was easy to get to. Not too far from interstate but was definitely in business area part of town. \nSTAFF: \nStaff was very friendly and attentive. Check in process was extremely easy\nROOM:\nRoom was very clean. High Speed internet was easy to access and it had a very big TV. We stayed in King Suite Room on the 1st floor. Noise level at night was very minimal to none. Breakfast was included the day after and I have to say i enjoyed it. They had English Muffin type sandwiches, pancakes and sausage along with regular breakfast fare. Was extremely packed on Saturday morning but that is to be expected. \nOVERALL:\nI would stay here again and I would recommend to friends.
