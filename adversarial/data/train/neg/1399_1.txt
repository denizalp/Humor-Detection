I selected Dr Hammond for my eye artery when I determined my sight had suffered long enough. I was very apprehensive about doing this procedure since having someone work on a major function like sight could be game changer if done incorrectly. After reading Dr Hammond bio I decided he was the doctor for the job. After having both my eyes repaired with new lenses I can say I made the right choice. He was very professional yet easy going in explaining the procedure and other issues relating to surgery. Even during the surgery he was explaining what he was doing. The surgery took a total of 15 minutes and the recovery has gone extremely well. \nI now have 20\/20 vision in both ways and I am seeing the world in its natural state again.
