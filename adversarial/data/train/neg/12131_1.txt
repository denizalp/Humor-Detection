Food is ok but the guy who worked there around 1 pm July 12,2018 is sooooo fXXKing rude to the client ahead of me who was old and nice and might have hearing issues! The staff rudely interrupted him and told him that he did not want to listen more but just answer YES or No! I can't believed what I heard!! My hands were shaky and felt heart broken! Imagine that old guy was my father , I would not hesitating giving that idiot a punch on his face! If any of your management read this review ,you are welcome to contact me and I'm more than happy to talk more!!
