I go here to get my prescriptions filled and also to shop for cosmetics and stuff occasionally.  I've never had a problem with the pharmacy.  The drive thru line can take a while at times, so I try to go during the off-peak hours.  When I don't have to wait for other people in line I can drive up, get my prescription, and be done in less than 5 minutes.\n\nand sometimes they have treats for my dog!
