I was looking forward to eatiiing here after reading all of the positive reviews.i was not at all that impressed with this place. I ordered red curry with vegetables (no meat no tofu) my firend ordered red curry with shrimp. I asked for thai hot which is supposed to be the hottest. My mate asked for a level 4 heat. We started out with a starter of fresh spring rolls(shrimp) the spring rolls were very good and the peanut sauce Was very good also. I would recommend the fresh spring rolls. Now on to the main dishes. My curry was very dissappointing, for vegetablles .Their were very small broccoli florets(without the stem) im not talking aboujt the big florets you see in salads or in most stir frys im talking about little tiny florets the ones that you find at the botttom of the soup bowl or all crushed up at the bottom of your salad, and sliced carrots and tons of bamboo shoots, that was all. Not satisifying.And i was not full or even half way full. Now the curry did have a good cocunut flavour but it was sweet .Dissappointing as i had asked for thai hot . My mates said his curry was too sweet also. Their were no veg in his curry other than potatoes and onion. He did say and i agree their was a good curry flavour and lots of it. Just way too sweet. Not sure if i would come back to eat here. Perhaps if i was in the neighboorhood. But i wouldnt go out of my way. Its sad, another thai restaurant thats dissappointing.
