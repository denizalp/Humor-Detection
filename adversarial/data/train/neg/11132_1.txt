What a stunning and chic addition to the neighbourhood!\nBeautiful decor, great music, delicious food (spicy!) and impeccable service :)\n\nMy friend and I started off with a pitcher of the Pear Sangria - very refreshing! They have an interesting drinks menu, I really want to try them all :D There is one called Finding Nemo - I wonder how that would look\/taste like - I will get it next time :D #lovenemo\n\nAppetizer, we went with Korean Kimchi Tacos with bulgogi shaved beef. Presentation was amazing. Love the Que signature fries... kinda taste like spicy Hickory Sticks :P\n\nFor entree, we ordered the Durty South Pulled Pork (Mmm!) with garlic mashed potatoes, creamy coleslaw and crispy corn bread. The only thing that threw me off was the corn bread. I was expecting it to be the traditional kind - soft and sweet - but I couldn't really taste the corn. Overall this dish was very tasty, each item complemented each other... even the corn bread lol.\n\nAs for dessert, Que doesn't have a dessert menu (yet? I forgot.) But they did offer their signature dessert - Tres Leches! It was a slice of cake made with 3 different types of milk. In my head, I was like cow's milk, goat's milk....???! hahaha... they actually really meant - regular milk, condensed milk and whipped cream LMAO! It was a bit too sweet for me, but my friend devoured it in seconds... got the sweet tooth XD\n\nOverall, it was a great experience! Definitely recommending this to all my friends! I'm going back this Saturday for a big birthday bash - Que is very accommodating, thank you so much :)\n\nP.S. They have live music every Fridays and Saturdays at 10pm. Time to party it up :D!
