Surrender is the new spot in town overthrowing XS as the new king of Vegas. Its sexy, sophisticated and in a league of its own. This club is not your typical megaclub and the majority of the time will be spent outside.  \n\nI was there this past weekend  and the lines were already wrapping thru Encore at 1030pm!.Good thing me and my group do not wait and we already had a hookup for a cabana for the night for an ultra low minimum. Within 5 minutes, we were on our way in.   Heres a little peak of the cabana area   \nhttp:\/\/sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-ak-snc4\/hs292.snc4\/40933_10150276814820241_557670240_14516208_3681604_n.jpg\n\nTo be people in previous reviews complaining about the hosts and stuff, do some research and head over to www.jackcolton.com, and you'll do vegas right.\n\nThe music was mainly house which is what i love! It was Aoki's friday but he was not there that night since he had a prior engagement in Germany. The music was on point all night. Mainly house with some mashups and occasional top 40.\n\nThe pool is off limits unless its their Dip N Dance event held every thursday. So ladies, this isnt XS where you can dance in the water. They also have tables to gamble at just like at XS. Drinks are you typical Vegas prices so no one should be shocked at the prices.\n\nOverall this is the spot to be at. If I were to go to only one club all weekend, Surrender is the spot.
