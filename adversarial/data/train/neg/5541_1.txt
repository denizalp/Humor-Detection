Continue to come here for breakfast, been 8 or 9 times now and it still has yet to fail me. Today I had the santa fe sautee and it was delicioso!! There are so many options on the menu that it is hard to choose from, but I have definitely found 3 favorites on here. The turkey and avocado sandwich was not a fav.. but I'm not much of an avocado fan anyway. I definitely recommend this place to people looking for a good breakfast joint.
