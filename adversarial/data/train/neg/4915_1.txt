We use Happy Tails for grooming and boarding. We have always been extremely happy with the service we have received.  They call when it's time to make an appointment for Jackie to stop by, which makes my life so much easier. Max, our dog, just loves going to visit this great \"doggie hotel\". Thank you to all the ladies at Happy Tails for taking such great care of our Max.
