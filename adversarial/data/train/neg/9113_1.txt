This place is as good as it gets.  I have a 9 month old Maltese that I take in every Saturday, and she always enjoys her visit.  I can always count on excellent service and prices from Deanna and Blake.   I completely trust them with my pup and I recommend them to all of my friends and family.\n\nThe store also has fresh baked doggy biscuits and an incredible stock of food, treats and clothes for all dogs, but what I appreciate most is the fact that everyone there seems to really love dogs.
