We came in as new customers tonight with our little dog. We had just left the dog park before coming in and needed to get her cleaned up! I've never done the self bathing (other than at home) and we decided to try something new last minute. I have to say, I was really happy coming here! We were the only ones and the woman working accommodated us. Since they were an hour away from closing, we were quick and tried to help keep it clean. \nOur little Moxxi smells wonderful and is all fluffy! We even bought some sweet potato treats for her.\nI really appreciated the employee helping us out :)
