My husband and I came here for the first time a few weeks ago for breakfast. Dick's was easy to find and we had no problems with parking. It almost reminded us of a King's. We went on a Saturday and there was plenty of seating. Our waitress was attentive and polite. My husband ordered the Eggs Benedict and added a side of bacon. According to him, the Eggs Benedict was alright. The bacon was good, but seemed expensive for a side of bacon. (Around $3?) I had the chocolate chip pancakes. They were average. Basically, our food was good, but nothing special. We may go back if we're in the area.
