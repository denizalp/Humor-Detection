As you may know, the people who own Las Palmas took this over. It will still be an IGA but with a Mexican flair and the Las Palmas location doors away will close. The tacos will be sold outside the IGA now near their free and big parking lot. \n\nAs for the tacos, I liked their pulled pork and chorizo ones best. The ground beef tacos are gummy and gristly and unseasoned and the steak and onions ones aren't bad. They double up each taco with corn tortillas.
