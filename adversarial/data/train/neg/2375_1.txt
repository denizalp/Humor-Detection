Dr. Judy's compassionate healthcare has quite literally changed my life! I was diagnosed with Hashimoto's autoimmune thyroid disorder in 2012 but struggled to find a doctor who could adequately treat my condition. I had tried both MDs and NMDs before Dr. Judy was recommended to me by a colleague. I have seen remarkable growth and progress in both my lab results and overall well-being since I started seeing Dr. Judy about three years ago. She takes the time during our appointments and never rushes through; at the same time, she is accommodating to my needs and is willing to see me for a quick check-up if that is all I can fit into my schedule. \n\nHer office staff is pleasant, and calling the main office number directs me to an actual person rather than an answering machine with a recorded message--always a plus! Her prices for visits, while not covered by my insurance, are rather reasonable. The supplements she recommends are stocked in the office, and prescriptions can be sent to my local pharmacy. \n\nOne of my favorite parts about Dr. Judy is the way she customizes her treatments to my individual needs: I feel completely comfortable telling her which products do and do not work, or even how much I can afford to spend in a given time period. Whether for overall health and wellness or for treatment of chronic or severe conditions, I have referred Dr. Judy to many friends and family members. I will continue to drive 45 minutes out of my way to receive the best doctor experience of my life!
