Well started off as a good evening as the company I work for seems to enjoy this place!!! Tonight was good for a awhile although the food here is always average at best it means more to me to hang out with those you love than the food but anyways the bartenders are complete assholes!!!  If your beverage was refilled then you were lucky!! Most times it meant for you to go to the bar only to be told to wait!!! Plus be careful because if you disturb one of the bartenders locals\/regulars chances are you will be kicked out for doing absolutely nothing wrong!! Kind of just the way they are there!!! Not the most welcoming environment!!! I won't be going back!!!!
