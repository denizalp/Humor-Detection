This is a great restaurant with a fitting Feng shui that enveloped the southern theme and the extremely high quality of food. Every time I go there I have a great meal that begins with an interesting dish that is great leading to a wonderful entr√©e that takes my senses on a tantalizing hayride. Besides a few small issues this is one of my favorite restaurants that I make the hike to Hudson for.
