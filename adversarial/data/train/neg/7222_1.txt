The ambience is really cozy and the staff are friendly! Ordered the fritters as starters. They were really light and quite tasty (albeit a bit bland). For the main course, I had the mushroom risotto. I had to leave half of it because it was so salty. The dessert really saved the meal for me, hence the 4 stars. I ordered the chocolate cake and it was heavenly! Presentation was great too. All in all, they need to really reduce the salt on the risotto but the rest of the meal was great.
