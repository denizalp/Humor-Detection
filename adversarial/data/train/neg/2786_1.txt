I was lucky enough to attend the Urban Decay event this past Saturday at my local Ulta in Goodyear AZ.  It was amazing!!!  Learned a ton of techniques. Made new friends and of course tried out products I have been wondering about.  Staff went out of their so we could try on multiple colors of the new lipstick launch and even provided breakfast.  Best event ever!!!!  Yeah Goodyear Ulta store!!!!  You filks at Ulta rocked it as always.  Special about out to Michelle, the prestige make-up manager.  She hires the best educated employees and her department is the best!!
