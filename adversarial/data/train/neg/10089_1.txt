After moving to the Gilbert area I have finally found my new dentist. Dr. Lighthall and Robyn were awesome and made me feel comfortable during my procedure.  The office is beautiful and conveniently located off of the 202 freeway.  I would highly recommend Dr. Skylar Lighthall and his practice for all of your dental needs!!
