Uptown Bar is really your only sit-down dining option if you're in the neglected strip that is Terminal A. Service here was brusque but not bad. I ordered a turkey burger and fruit cup. The turkey burger was about as bland as I've ever had and based on the shape of the party and (lack of) flavor, I am reasonably certain that it was a frozen patty. The bun was blah but the tomato and lettuce were surprisingly tolerable. I was excited about having some fresh fruit with my meal until I spotted the long hair sticking out of the front of the fruit cup. Hard. Pass. \n\nAlso, it's rather odd that they use plasticware rather and plastic & metal trays as opposed to actual plates. They can do better. I don't write many two-star reviews, but sanitation issues are not cool.
