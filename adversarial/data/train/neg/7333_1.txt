I arrived shortly before my scheduled appointment.  The waiting room was jammed packed. I was not happy with the hour+ long wait I experienced.  At one point I left the reception area to use the restroom which passed by the nurses station.  I took that opportunity to ask what the hold-up was.  I was pleasant when asking, not rude.  I was told I would not be seeing Dr. Kim, I would instead be seen by her PA.  That was a little disappointing but I was ok with it. I said fine, as long as somebody would please see me immediately, since I'd been waiting over an hour.  \n\nDr. Kim's PA rushed through my exam.  Specific questions I wanted to ask were left unanswered because of the hurried pace.   I will be returning to my former doctor for my next screening.  I may use Spectrum for advanced care if I need it (MOHS surgery), because I was treated without too long of a wait two years ago, and I really liked Drs. Kim and Thosani.  However, this visit was a waste of my time.  To top it off, when I was leaving the front desk receptionist disagreed with me as to when I was last seen and at which location after I repeatedly informed her of specific dates and locations.  Sheesh.  I'm a paying customer\/patient.  Please afford me the respect I give you... don't treat me like an annoyance.  Spectrum's administrative staff needs lessons in courtesy and organization.
