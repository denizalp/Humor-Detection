This restaurant is always a MUST when we come to Las Vegas. We always get the Australian lobster tail and it never, NEVER, fails to disappoint! But tonight was made extra special with PEGGY serving us. Her upbeat and friendly personality and eagerness to ensure everything surpassed our expectations made one of our last dinners here memorable. We're sad to hear Buzio restaurant is closing, but we hope to see Peggy and her smiling face in the near future again at the Rio.\n\nThank you, Peggy!!!
