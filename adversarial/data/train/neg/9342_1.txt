5 stars for originality, affordability and musical ability. This place is perfect for well versed O.G.'s who like their bone marrow with a side of Bone Thugs. Sophistication and street savvy play well together here without feeling like a gimmick and I believe that blend is what makes a business memorable. \n\nI arrived on a busy Friday night, around 8:30. Both hostess and server were cool and genuinely friendly. I ordered the Shishito peppers to start, so delicious! The salmon is insane!!! Buttery and accompanied by sweet carrots and green onions.. no words do I have to describe them beyond YUM.. and very well priced at $14. \n\nThe only bad part of my experience was that I didn't think to order dessert! Can't wait to try that and brunch. Well done Joe's! We're rooting for you
