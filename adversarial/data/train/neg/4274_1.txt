We went here on Saturday night in Las Vegas and were sadly seated a good distance from all of the food stations, and on the complete opposite end of the room from the self serve drink station. Was hard to believe with how many empty tables there were closer, all of my food was so so, turkey was great, and the little bit of crab legs left when I got there were very good, but later on when I checked for more, a good 30 minutes, they still hadn't refilled it, unlimited crab legs didn't happen. Neither me nor my fianc√© enjoyed the desserts so we were very thankful that we did not pay full price with a coupon we had purchased. Wish they did a cheaper price for those that do not want the unlimited beer and wine as neither of us would have paid for it, my one glass of wine, was very hard to drink and I was not even able to finish it. Our server was very nice but definitely would have preferred to be seated closer to the food and drinks.
