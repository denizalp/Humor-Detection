Ok so here we are at the old standard hooley house. Westlake's #2 sports bar behind yard house. The browns radio shows usually do remotes here & today Ken carman w the coaches show on 92.3. Terrance Mitchell is the guest and he was a good dude. See pic. \n\nI get the hooley hunks & tots. The Bro did the same and they're good. Cute staff always it helps. Loud place great to watch any games they have a million tv. \n\nIt's not great it's not bad it is what is is. Day drunks crowd are the regulars come to hit on the barmaid last chance saloon crowd but I've been there myself so how can I cast the first stone?  Tonight is football Thur so grown ass men in jerseys. For my $$ that only works with hockey but hey. \n\nI come here for events. Lately I do my day drinking elsewhere but I'm trying to cut down. 3 stars come on in and watch the game. Chicken Hunks are not bad. Other stuff, sliders I guess. Pizza is meh don't go there. $28+. It's down the way from the hacienda so there's that.
