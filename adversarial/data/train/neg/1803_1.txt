I have a bit of a bias for the Square fillets second cup. I go there every morning for my morning coffee and bagel. One of the things I like the most is that there is one barista there who seems to be the morning manager and she is I really welcoming and friendly morning person. Although I go there every day they always remember what size and type of coffee I like to take and they often bring me my bagel to my table once I sit down which is actually a very nice touch. They also have free Wi-Fi there which is pretty cool and it's one of the places I like hang out there the most once I'm in that area. They have the usual thoroughfare of pastries croissants, and other delicious treats although I stay away from those. (For health reasons) To conclude although most of these franchise coffee Shops are majoritarily  the same the difference really comes with the staff and how friendly and courteous they are. And this is one of the friendliest most easy-going group of baristas in the city.
