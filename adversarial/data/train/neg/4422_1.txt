My friends and I came here for the Sunday Champagne Brunch. The most enticing part is that the whole meal is $30! Thirty dollars for 5 courses and endless champagne! \n\nThe first course is Soup. I got the french onion soup which I found to be delicious and probably the best course out of the five. \n\nThe second course, salad, I ordered the baby greens salad, big mistake! It was literally just leafy greens with nothing else and dressing on the side. No vegetables, cheese or croutons just leaves! \n\nThe third course, appetizers, I ordered the crab-shrimp strudel. The flavor was there but that was about it. The shrimp were the tiniest shrimp ever, not what I was expecting. I really thought\/was hoping it would either be a jumbo shrimp or two medium shrimps in the strudel. There were just too many little shrimps that the dish became overwhelming and I couldn't finish it. \n\nThe fourth course, entree, I ordered the beef wellington and this is where the hiccup came. When our entrees came out I received the Potato Crusted Walleye. While a friend of mine shared her Beef Wellington with me so that I didn't have to wait while everyone else ate, I wasn't impressed by either meal. The walleye was the weirdest fillet of fish I have ever seen in my eating career and I couldn't taste the capers in the walleye and that might have been because there weren't any in my dish. The beef wellington was okay but lacked flavor. The entree portion was simply disappointing.\n\nThe last course, dessert, was actually great! I ordered the cranberry orange cheesecake. The flavor was perfect and not a bit overwhelming. My friends all agreed that the besides the soup the dessert was the best dish.
