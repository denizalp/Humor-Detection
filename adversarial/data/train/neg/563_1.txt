This place is always busy whenever we go. We went on a Wednesday night and we got sat right away but it was def packed. The salsa here is delicious its got a hint of spice in it which is great since it is not plain. They had good drink specials, tonight it was $3 Mexican beers. I got the enchiladas and they were so good. There was 3 of them and super filling. My friends got the small salad and it was huge too. Our waitress was very sweet and very attentive. The prices are a little more than traditional Mexican restraunts but with the amount of food we got it was worth it. Great tex Mex place to go.
