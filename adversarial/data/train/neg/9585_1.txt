Went to Canter's for lunch and was satisfied overall with the meal.  Canter's is the deli located inside of TI.  Overall, I have to say that if you asked me to pick a deli I wanted to eat at; for the money I still put Carnegie above and beyond all the other \"strip\" deli's.  \n\nCanter's did have the delicious beaverton mustard that Ashley and I love, and the fresh onion rings were delicious.  However, the sandwich and overall menu seemed limited in comparison to a place like Carnegie @ Mirage.  Canter's is still a safe bet if you find yourself hungry and spaced for time at TI.
