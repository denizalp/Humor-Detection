I have been going to this nail salon for years now probably since i was 18 and im in my late 20's now even when i moved further away for a couple years i still made the drive to get my nails done and eyebrows waxed here. They are very nice and welcoming. Tony is my favorite even though there all nice him and his wife are awesome and always remember me and things that are going on in my life and take interest. Its very relaxing and enjoyable experience everytime.
