This is my absolute favorite health food store. The prices here beat any of the other places I've checked around the city(I've checked many.) On average at least $2+ cheaper for the items I usually buy. It's tight, but that doesn't bother me. I live nearby at the moment but will be moving soon and will make the trip back because it is worth it!
