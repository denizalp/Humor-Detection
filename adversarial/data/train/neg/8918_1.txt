I came here for the second time and the consistency remained the same. This will be an aggregated review of my first and second experience here.\n\nService: Below average service due to the capacity, high turnover and lack of staff. The waiter\/waitresses were over worked and they were not attentive. I don't blame them because of the amount of people to server ratio but I would've appreciated if they had a better attitude.\n\nWIFI IS WEAK. It didn't work the two times I was here.\n\nThe staff were irritated with the amount of customers and their frustration really showed on their faces and replies. I had to walk over to a server and try to order but she snapped at me to wait for her to finish cleaning up. I was taken aback but was understanding because they were overworked.\n\nDecor: Good - warm lighting and good ambience. Quiet chatter all around but tables are close together so do not expect privacy. Some electrical outlets placed sneakily under seating so studying\/charging is possible.\n\nFood\/drink\/dessert: Average - nothing special.\nWe shared an \"Ugly Duckling\" shaved ice which consisted of sweetened\/soaked peanuts, condensed milk, taro and an ice cream scoop. This was much better than the \"mango tango\" shaved ice we ordered last time. My recommendation for shaved ice is for REAL INGREDIENTS by that I mean genuine toppings. The mango tango does not have any mango; it only has mango balls so it was very lack lustre. We were smarter this time to get real ice cream, taro and peanuts for the ugly duckling. Price for one shaved ice is $7.99 + tax. I would recommend sharing with 3 people (with 2, it's too filling).\n\nI had the black sesame brick toast last time and it was too dry. I would not recommend \n\nPrice: Average - not overly priced but nothing cheap. Your standard competitive pricing with other bubble tea type shops like Go for Tea etc.\n\nAccessibility: Good - it is upstairs but there is an elevator for wheel-chair accessibility which is great. Parking is decent but it can get packed around late evening when everyone comes out to these tea shops.\n\nOverall, an average place that is good for hanging out with friends. I would not come for on a first date but it could be a fun and relaxing place.
