We are a step or two above subway here!  The bread is much better, and there is more of the meat in their sandwichs.  I had the \"vito\", italian meat sub, with lettuce, onion, mater, dressing and mayo.  Deli meats taste fresh and the bread is hours old.  \n\nThe service is very quick, but that is the advertising plan, isn't it!  The drive-in seems slower than walk-in.  But don't you want to know if your sandwich bounced off the floor?!  Get out of the car and watch them work.
