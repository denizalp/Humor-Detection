I was put on to this little hotel by a friend of mine. Originally it was a little run down motel, but now they turned it into a nice little boutique style hotel. The lobby is great and the staff were very helpful. The rooms were big and very clean. It's located directly across from the Hard Rock, so it kind of feels like you're staying there....just not paying the HR price!\n\nI recommend this place to a younger crowd for sure. The pool is going to be amazing during the summer!
