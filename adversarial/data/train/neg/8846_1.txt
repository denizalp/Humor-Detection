First and foremost this place doesn't have queso. We should have known from this that we should have eaten elsewhere. There were three of us. All of our meals were bland. The guacamole was essentially avocado soup with no flavor. The cheese quesadilla was a congealed cheese log. Chips had no flavor. Very disappointing. But the salsa was good, if that matters.
