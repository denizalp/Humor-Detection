Have your wedding here if you don't want your guests to be served dinner.  They legitimately never served 2 tables dinner at a wedding.. worst service ever.  I would suggest NEVER having a wedding here if you want your guests to actually eat dinner.  I have been to numerous weddings...had my own wedding... and have NEVER heard of guests not being served dinner.
