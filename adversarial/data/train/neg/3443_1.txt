Loved the smaller venue at Harrahs, made the experience very intimate. Bill Medley is fantastic. He has an amazing voice taking you down memory lane and Bucky sounds just like Bobby. I loved hearing my favorite Righteous Brothers songs! I loved the moving video tribute to Bobby! Bill adds a bit of humor to the show, which I loved. My only complaint was that the show is way too short! There are more songs needed to be sung in the show. I felt a bit cheated. Call me greedy, but I needed more than an hour show!
