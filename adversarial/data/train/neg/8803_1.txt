I recently moved my wife from Cleveland to Oakland, Ca and decided to use ABF to move her belongings. We decided to use ABF's Relocube service and couldn't be happier, the price was dirt cheap, the company was extremely helpful and all her belongings arrived safely at our door less than a week after pick up. Also, our driver Mark from Cleveland deserves a special shout out for being so friendly, helpful and absolutely hilarious.
