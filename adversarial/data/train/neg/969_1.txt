Hm - Sushisamba was just an okay experience for me, at least in my first go-around. \n\nOur waitress was super nice, friendly and fun. She recommended a terrific sake (around $80) that gave the three of us about 3-4 shots each of sake. Terrific stuff. \n\nThe decor was weird but interesting and modern. Definitely had a mixture of a lot of Japanese influences all-around with a chic look all-around. \n\nLet's talk food. The otsumami was the best item of the bunch. Loved the presentation and for a group of 3, definitely a nice appetizer. Loved the sauce for the fried green beans. The samba sushi and Neo Tokyo were simply okay to us. The quality of the sushi was okay but the flavors never really stuck out as distinct. The uni as well (which we ordered separately) was pretty okay as well yet just didn't have the same fresh quality we would have at another sushi restaurant. For the cost (for three people, being around $400+), it just didn't exactly match up completely for us. \n\nWould love to come back and try some of the more fusion items which seemed definitely more interesting. Just for the food itself, it was just okay.
