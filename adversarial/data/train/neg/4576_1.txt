Ridiculously good! Wow some of the best fried chicken I've ever had! The biscuits were equally as incredible! What a fabulous dining experience. My husband ordered the shrimp and grits and said those were fabulous as well. Can't not mention the fried green tomatoes we devoured as an appetizer amongst the three of us. You really can't go wrong here. Must try! Everything! Seriously. A table across from us ordered dessert and if we could muster up more room in our bellies would have taken the bait. Enjoy! Ask for Lauren!
