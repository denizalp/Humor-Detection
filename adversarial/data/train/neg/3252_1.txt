I add three stars because they won't show up if I don't give star. This is a bad shop. I do feel like there were some comments was lie and write by internal staffs. Why I said that? Because I talk to couple customers in their shop. NO ONE has good comments for them. They also feel expensive, staffs lying them as some unknown motor vehicle descriptions, try to ask them pay more money, waiting time is extremely long! Even one girl there have a coupon for oil change as $17. They add fee and tax which already over $20. I heard the staff talk to her it is the same service to outside normal oil change, wait time was 1.5 hours. What the...!! You know there are some coupon cost $10 - $15 only. Even Big O Tires were $16 something with tax. Never go higher like this shop. I won't come back again.
