I took my car in because my AC wasn't working and blowing out hot air.  I had a AC leak that needed to get fixed.  I left my car with them overnight and picked up my car the next day being that my AC was fixed.  $479 dollars later, It was blowing out cold air and worked that night.  The next day, I went for a drive and my car was blowing out hot air again.  I gave Matt (owner) a call to let them know what is going on with my car, but they are closed for weekends.  Monday comes around and I have still not recieved a phone call till that afternoon.  They informed me to bring the car in, so I did.  Well Tuesday afternoon comes around and I still have not received a phone call about my car.  I give them a ring and they inform me that the bolt for the condenser doesn't fit and will need to buy a new AC condenser.  They inform me that \"if I need wheels\", I can pick up my car to drive and they will work on getting a quote for condenser.   It has been 4 days and still haven't gotten a phone call about a quote. \n\nThe major problem I have with these con artists is that they are supposed to be mechanics. They threaded the condenser bolt in 1\/4 of the way and thought it was in all the way.  I then should of gotten a phone call before they went any further, but they \"thought the bolt was in all the way\". When I took back the car after AC didnt work the next day, they caught the fact that the bolt wasn't able to go in any further.  Anyone that has ever screwed any bolts in to anything would know that it would fit or not.  Not only was I scammed on the whole job, I still have yet to get a phone call! \n\nDO NOT GO HERE!
