Great pizza! I started with a Verde and added toppings down the line. Nice, crisp and cooked to perfection. I didn't have a salad but after seeing other people ordering them I wished I had. My husband also loved his specialty pizza with pepperoni and salami. Will definitely be back to this place again.
