My sister and I bought an RV trailer 16 ft in Las Vegas Nevada our first.    We couldn't have had a better Sales rep was Raymond Juvera, we put him thru hell and winded up given him our business, he went way beyond for us new owners.    If and when we are ready to upgrade we will be back to see Ramen again and Bluedog RV.    Please do if you go there to look for an RV ask for him you have the best experience.
