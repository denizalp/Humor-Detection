I happened to just walk into Pink Cherry because I was meeting my friend at Serenade that day. I've never been to a waxing place before so I did not know what to expect, I was really nervous and kind of sure that since I did not have an appointment I would not be getting anything done that day. Upon walking in I was greeted by Miley and she was just the best! She's very knowledgable and made me feel comfortable. To my surprise, they had an opening and I signed up for my first ever Brazillian. I've googled about Brazillians before and that definitely did not help with my nerves. While waiting for my appointment, Miley answered all the questions I had and that made me feel better. I was lucky enough to have Shaina. Very professional and very friendly and super quick. I can't stress enough how at ease she made me feel when having my first ever brazillian done. I went there yesterday and I'm still telling anyone who will listen to me to go there. Love this place and love the people.
