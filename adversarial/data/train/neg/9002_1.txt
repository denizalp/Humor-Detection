The food is delicious!! The Carnita Chimichanga was so crispy on the outside and delicious all the way through. The service was outstanding and Ben the owner was great. We enjoyed it so much we spent 2 hours talking to Ben after our meal. Thank you guys for a great meal with great company... We will be back.
