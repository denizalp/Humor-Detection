Not great, not terrible. \nI came here with two friends, knowing that I wanted to get the cookie monster ice cream I kept seeing on instagram. In my opinion, it was pretty overpriced and not worth the hype but still good and it did look nice so +1 for presentation. \nMy friends had more trouble because as they pointed to flavours on the menu, they kept being told they were sold out....seems a little weird to be out of over half the menu early in the day?\n\nI might come back here, but I think there are other places with more selection that could be better.
