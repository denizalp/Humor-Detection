Came for a birthday party.  Food was excellent.  Tom Yum soup, beef jerky, oysters and papaya salad rocked.  Everything was clean and wonderfully spiced.  Very good wine list. Killed it with a Vouvrey.  The lemongrass salmon. Is highly recommended.  Thai soul food.  Will be back.  Very good service.
