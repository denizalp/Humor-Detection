I ordered over $44 in food from the drive thru. I brought the food home and found they messed up my order. They didn't include all the ingredients of my meal. I called the restaurant and told them of the mistake and they said,\"Give me your name and the next time you come in we will give you the missing ingredients.\"\n\nSo if they forget the lettuce on your taco, you get only lettuce in return. The lady fought with us and said that it's only guacamole so you can still eat it. But if you pay over $11 for a plate, I would expect all the ingredients.\n\nThe lady hung up and will not answer the phone anymore. Phone is off the hook.
