Our server could talk his way in or out of anything. Ordered his recommendation - deep fried burritos iirc - and a kind of spring roll with guacamole. It was very nice, good calls by our server. Was a good price and the churros from the check in came late but was sooooo worth it. I think next time I would order more guac w the spring rolls if I got it again since it was a bit dry
