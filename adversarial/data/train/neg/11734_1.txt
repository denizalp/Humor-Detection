This is my second time taking my car here for an oil change. The first time I came in they were quick and I was in and out. I took it on my lunch break and worked from their waiting room - overall it wasn't a bad experience for ~$35. They wanted to charge me $70 at the other place I took it too. \n\nSecond time I came back they took 20 minutes longer than they estimated. I wouldn't have had much t say about it except for the fact I told them I was on my lunch break and they assured me it would be done. \n\nBoth times when they were telling me what they did and what I \"needed\". They try to sell you on the extra services like any other place. \n\nOverall average experience. Nothing remarkable. Customer service wasn't very great though. Guys in the garage at the front desk seemed pretty miserable.
