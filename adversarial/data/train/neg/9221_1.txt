We arrived a little earlier than our reservation time but were immediately seated.  Our server immediately welcomed us and shared the specials of the day.  We had the tomato appetizer which was outstanding.  We then had the bone-in rib eye which was great.  The Flemings potatoes are a MUST!  They are the best.  Later, the manager came to our table to ask how everything was going.  The best thing (and there were a lot!) about our experience was our server, Melissa.  She was truly a joy and made our experience (our wedding anniversary) memorable.  We will return and ask for her.
