worst experience EVER! DON'T waste your money or time\n\nMy boyfriend and I came here on a Saturday night around 7:30 because we never been and wanted to give it a shot, we get seated and about 10 minutes go by and we still have not been greeted to give our drink order and it was not even busy. we finally get greeted and we receive our bread about 3 min later . we order chicken strips and spinach artichoke dip. we get our food and everything was warm, not hot at all, When i go to a restaurant i expect hot food., I ordered the Tuscan chicken and when it came to the table , it looked like crap, nothing like the picture , not even close. The cream sauce was broken and very oily the chicken was overcooked, and once again , it wasn't even hot, and looked like the did not even care about presentation. The waiter drops the check off and it was almost $50 and after that I get fed up,  we were not going to be  paying for this crappy food and crappy service, we  go to the manager and complain and just end up paying for my boyfriend food. worst first experience and will not be coming back ever, terrible food and lame service
