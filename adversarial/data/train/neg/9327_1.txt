MUST try. Famous Portuguese chicken spot. The chicken was amazing. Some of the best I've had. The fries were seasoned with salt and pepper and were really good. The dressing on the salad was also really good. 2 1\/4 leg dinners with water and 2 buns for $20. Very affordable. Their natage must be very popular because they sold out.
