Went for brunch. Reasonably priced for a pretty decent buffet. The best part was our waitress. Her name is Elena, I am pretty sure she is the best waitress I have EVER and usually buffet waitress you don't see much of. She had refills to our drinks before we were even done and we were drinking a lot of ice teas. Our table never had anything empty left on it, she was smiling and right on top of it! Really great experience.
