I had the cheeseburger and my coworker had the French dip.  Hands down the best French dip I ever had. (Thanks for sharing co-worker). Melt in your mouth, thinly sliced prime rib, just the right spice horseradish served on the perfect bread.  Worth the $19.\n\nThe burger was awesome as well.  It was one of those fancy burgers served with a horseradish aloi.  Great burger, friendly staff, slightly above average price point but worth it!
