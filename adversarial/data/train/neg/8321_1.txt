Herbs and Nutrition is by far the BEST health food shop I have ever gone to. I go in there every single day and not only are the staff incredibly friendly and SUPER helpful, but they have the best prices. By far. I used to go regularly to another health food store down the street to get certain oils and supplements, but they are at least $10 cheaper at Herbs and Nutrition. Now it's my 'go to'. I can't recommend this place enough. :-)
