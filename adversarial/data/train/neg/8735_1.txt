I have to say that the place got worse over the years. The plates and the cutlery have stains on them, the ketchup tastes weird, and even the water sometimes has little bits floating in it.\n\nOn the bright side, they offer very big portions of food for reasonable prices. The breakfast is the best deal, a huge plate for only 2$ + tax (although it used to be 1$). They also offer an series of poutines which all taste great and really fill you up, however they make take over 30 minutes to arrive sometimes, which can be a letdown.
