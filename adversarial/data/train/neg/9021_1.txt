Always crave for an In n Out burger. Hawaii doesn't have the joint so that's always on my to eat list!! Got the #1 all animal style! Always soooooo good!! I will have to stop in before I leave. And not to mention they always got the friendliest staff. It's always super busy but these workers are giving 100% Of their customer service!! Yesss!
