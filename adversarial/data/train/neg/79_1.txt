I love having sushi & beer for breakfast, with a custom made-to-order omelette, with a French vanilla cappuccino & some other non-breakfast type items!!\n\nThe price isn't bad & the table servers are really fast & friendly!! The second you leave an empty plate beside you, someone comes to pick it right up & remove it!! The food is good no matter what you want & they have most food genres.. They also have UNLIMITED BEER & WINE!!! \n\nfor the Saturday brunch, it's way more expensive, but they have unlimited mimosas & wine also.. \n\nVery fun buffet, had to hit this place up every morning we stayed!!
