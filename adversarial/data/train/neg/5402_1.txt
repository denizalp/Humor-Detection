A cool new place that just opened up on King east. They serve Pilot coffee and make all types. They also have tasty treats from cookies to Empanadas. It is naturally well lit as it is a corner unit and has a very cool urban feel. They are waiting for their liquor license and will then open at night time as a drinks bar. In the summer they will open up a cool patio where you can enjoy all their tasty drinks. I look forward to frequenting this cool new spot in this up and coming neighborhood.
