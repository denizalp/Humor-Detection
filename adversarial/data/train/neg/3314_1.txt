I have been using Oakmont Automotive since it was just Chuck (owner) taking personal care of each and every customer. Now, many years later he is still there side-by-side with a terrific staff (LOVE Tony!!) continuing the tradition of customer first and always being upfront, fair and honest. I recommend Oakmont Automotive to everyone. Courteous. Fair. Transparent. HONEST... and overall good guys to boot!! You will not be disappointed!!
