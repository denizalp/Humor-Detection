I have been coming here for years. Love the bagels and everything they offer to put on them. Their bagels are the best in Nevada and the closest you will find to a NY bagel The homemade soups are great. You will never leave hungry because they serve very large portions! Breakfast is great too. After a sit down meal we  always buy bagels to go as well as items from their bakery which makes my bill quite hefty (this place is quite expensive). BUT lately I have been leaving this place quite annoyed because of the crappie service and all the employees seem very miserable and it's starting to get on my nerves.
