Called to get an estimate and the girl that answered the phone sounded like the call woke her up (at 3:30pm) and couldn't give an estimate over the phone.  Apparently only managers can do that, negating the need for someone answering the phone.  Unless you want to have a in-person estimate set up well in advance, call elsewhere.
