Unfortunately we had terrible service here. We stopped in for some beers and appy's after a day of skating at Olympic plaza. There was 9 of us in total, and we didn't get our first drink for over 30 minutes. \n\nOnce we had the waiters attention, our food came fast and was decent. Average pub food! No complaints here!\n\nThen the evening entertainment had to do a sound check and holy did that ever clear the place out. The sound quality was awful, just way way way too loud, we resorted to texting each other at the table and then left. \n\nTerrible experience.
