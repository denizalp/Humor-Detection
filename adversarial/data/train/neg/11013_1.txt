Service at counter is quick to seat. Drink and wait staff are somewhat slow. Had to ask for things throughout the meal.\n\nThe selections are somewhat more on the seafood selections. The food was mediocre tasting at best. Some meats were over cooked or overly sauced. Some items got cold fast. Nothing was remarkable or different from other buffets. Dessert selections are decent but not great. \n\nSome selections include crab legs (steamed or chilled), prime rib, ribs, fish, chicken, pizza, gelato, and cotton candy.\n\nStaff was accommodating to find us candles for a birthday we were out celebrating. \n\nOverall just three stars. Almost two stars had it not been for the candles. I would give another try. Not the worst and not the best of buffets.
