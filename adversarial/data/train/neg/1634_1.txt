The ambiance was pleasant, the staff were nice. However the food weren't really great. Actually the entrees weren't, the warm brie was pretty tasty. \nMy husband ordered the sirloin, medium. It came out rare, the manager offered a new one (medium well this time), came out well done. 4 stars are for the brie platter and how nice the staff were.
