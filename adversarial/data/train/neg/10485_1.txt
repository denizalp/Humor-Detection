I came here with a work group after Cowboy Ciao lost our reservation and were pretty well taken care of on short notice. Check the website, the atmosphere is pretty swank. Huge space with a lot of thought put into it...neat-o. The service was absolutely excellent, and we never had to ask\/wait for anything. \n\nNow the food... not too bad, but not amazing. We had a global group of visitors (Sydney, NYC, London, Chicago, Dublin) and everyone was happy with the choices, and what they ordered. Decent value for the money, but not overly memorable. On the plus side, the wine list was extensive and fairly diverse, so we were quite happy with that. The cocktails were creative, but all the ones I tried slanted a bit to the sweet side on balance (not a bad idea for mass appeal).\n\nP.S. Cowboy Ciao was pretty accommodating. Their manager got on the phone and arranged for a group of 10 to walk in to Olive & Ivy with no notice, so I appreciated the effort.
