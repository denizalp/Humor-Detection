Let me say this. This venue is not a music venue. This is a ballroom. One you would use for wedding. I loved Adele but hated this venue. It was hour, crowded. It took 30 minutes to get in and after going to the other side learned there was only 1 bathroom on the other side. Book and stage and the pool are so much better venues at Cosmo
