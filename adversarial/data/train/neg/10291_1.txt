I have been coming here for 7 years and it is my go-to Mexican restaurant in AZ. Whenever Is have friends or family in town and they are craving Mexican food, I always direct them to this great place. Service has always been top notch. Food quality and quantity is phenomenal, and the menu items are appropriately priced. It makes me feel good when I see the restaurant's namesake, Nando, on site and working amongst the staff. If Mexican food is on your mind, do yourself a favor and visit Nando's. You will not be disappointed.
