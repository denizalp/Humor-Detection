Cafe Zupas has delicious food and warm company. Every time I walk in, there is always someone there at the line to greet me with a big smile. Ordering is easy, everything is on a line and made as you walk down it. My favorite sandwiches are the pesto chicken, the cuban grilled pork, and the honey bacon club. All three are absolutely fantastic, but the other sandwiches I have tried there are all wonderful. I love the chipotle chicken salad and the chicken enchilada chili as well. The place can get really packed very quickly, but it normally moves pretty quickly. For having food healthier than that of other fast foods restaurants, I'm happy to go here when I need a lunch. I've recommended this spot to many of my coworkers, and everyone has loved it!
