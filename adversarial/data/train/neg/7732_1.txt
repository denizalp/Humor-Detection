Needed a threading and found a random place on Yelp to do a walk-in. The place was empty and I was helped right away. It was very clean, and the woman who did my threading and tinting was really sweet. It ended up being $22 for both, which is a couple dollars more than I expected. However, I won't knock off a star just for that, because it wasn't OVERLY expensive and my eyebrows look fine nonetheless!
