I discovered Naked Red in Summer 2010 while browsing around Liberty Village. I was initially impressed by the store's offerings and Daniella's helpful nature. Unfortunately, I learned quickly that Daniella is a true sales person who wants to make money at any cost to her customers. I was going through a rough time on the verge of losing my job (eventually lost it in Mar. 2011) and was looking for a boost in my work wardrobe hoping it would help my situation and find a new job. She very much took advantage of this. I spent $10,000 at her store in less than a year. It happened what seemed at the time in the blink of an eye. I had to take on a 2nd job to pay off my credit card because of her pushy nature and her taking advantage of my obviously vulnerable position. She convinced me that I was in dire need of a completely new wardrobe when I just went in there for some work clothes. I will never forget when I said I didn't really like this one blouse she suggested. She said \"C'mon, this is NOT expensive Lauren\" as if it mattered that it was on sale even though I didn't like it. If anyone wants to up their sales, hire Daniella Rella as a consultant. She will milk all your customers dry and take you to the next level of your retail business.
