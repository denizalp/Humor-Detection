Go for the spa treatments, then stay for the poolside bar & lunch. Keep a running tab open because the drinks & food are delish. Fairly priced too! Sun or shade bathing by the indoor\/outdoor pool, even nap like a content kitten. Also, we were able to use the lockers, showers, hairdryers to clean up before night out on the town. An oasis of pampering in a low key pace, under the beautiful Vegas desert sky!
