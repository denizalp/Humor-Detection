It's a new restaurant. It's obviously growing and going through learning curves. It's apparent with the new waitstaff too. But that should detract from its potential. Yes, it was expensive to try. Yes, I learned to be patient. But I somehow felt it was nice. The food was spot on. The server was friendly but albeit slow and somewhat forgetful (delivered the wrong dessert but more than made up for it by comping it and bringing the requested one). All in all, the food was flavorful and tasty, the atmosphere was rustic yet modern, and the waitstaff were trying. Give it a try but expect to not be wowed. Opening a restaurant takes time and patience. The least you can do is help them help you. Besides, if nothing else, my burger was juicy and delicious while my salad was refreshing. And hey, when I bumped into my waitress the next day and quizzed her on my tables order? She nailed it. How she remembered that? No one will know. Keep up the good work - I'll be back soon to be wowed!
