Went for happy hour and felt like I definitely needed more of something else. Usually not the case after an actually happy happy hour.\n\nSuper busy on a Friday around 6 (to be expected), but we found 2 seats at the bar pretty quickly, which was great.\n\nThe service was pretty sub-par. Our server asked us what we wanted to drink way before giving us the extensive happy hour menu. Kinda weird. She wasn't very attentive or welcoming either. Stars off for boo bear. She woulda been cute if she ever smiled.\n\nBoth martinis I got were good. Peachy Apple was wayyyyy more potent than the Koi, though. Wonder what was up with that.\n\nWe ordered the chicken and biscuits and sliders. Chicken dish was good, but it was literally 2 fried chicken wings and one mini biscuit with an obscure white gravy. Pretty darn expensive to be slicing a tiny piece of bread down the middle to share. The sliders were lukewarm and kinda soggy. Would not ever get those again.\n\nAlthough this place is more like a loud and crowded bar for over 40s than a legit steakhouse setup, I think I need to come back for an actual steak next time. The live music consisted of a fake Adele singing stuff like \"Sweet Caroline\" into a rhinestone encrusted mic...Very weird for the setting. Hopefully the service will be much much better when I give this joint another chance. I'll be sure to bring my coupon from the mailbox!
