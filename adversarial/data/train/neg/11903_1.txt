The strange staff conversation about eczema and other skin ailments aside, the experience was pleasant enough and the food was good but not wowwing.  While I wouldn't say it didn't like the place, I wouldn't go out of my way to go back, which is telling because I would have to go pretty far out of my way.  It's in a strip mall in North royalton - ish area.  Not really for me.
