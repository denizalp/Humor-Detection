Awesome!  I'm a total fan!  I would give more stars if I could.  This place gave me such a work out but it was so fun I didn't care until I got home and had to take a nap.  I went with 2 friends and it took us 3 hours to get through all 5 stations (self paced).  I do recommend wearing a ton of bug spray.  Some of the obstacles are over marshy areas with lots of mosquitoes.  And if you have sensitive hands wear gloves.  You can buy some there for $6. Also wear clothes you don't mind getting dirty because you will sweat and if it rains the zip line landing areas get a touch muddy.  I will absolutly be going back!
