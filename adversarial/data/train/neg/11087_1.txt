It is the only authenic northen Chinese restaurent in Champaign-Urbana area. You might have realized more Chinese then foreign people will eat in Bo Bo China because Americans like fake Chinese food such as orange chiken or General Tso's Chicken which never appear in China. It is one of the very few Chinese restaurants that offer hot pot (average) in Champaign and the only restaurant offer good home made Chinese buns every Thursday evening (unfortunately you need to call and order around noon because Chinese students on campus are crazy about them).\n\nI gave it a 3\/5 because I am from southern China so not a big fan for northern food, but objectively the northen food they have is very good. Anther reason is that they don't seen to have enough people working there, so they serve food slower than average Chinese restaurants (but still faster than American ones). And lastly, it's not a fancy restuarant to take your girlfriend on a first date. It's more about a home style one.
