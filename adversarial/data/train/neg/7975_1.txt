Hit or miss for me. \n\nThe most popular American Chinese foods, like sesame chicken or general tso's chicken are usually prepped in advanced, so the quality is diminished. These chicken dishes have a ton of breading on them also, and are way too submerged in sauce. \n\nI tried the Lo Mein too, and it was extremely salty on its own, so I was disappointed. \n\nThe bubble tea is also really watery. \n\nHowever, the service is pretty fast. \n\nIf you're really craving American Chinese food, and want to enjoy Schenley Plaza, go for it, but it's not that special.
