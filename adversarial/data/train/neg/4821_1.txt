If I could give them 0 stars I would. The couple were unprofessional and appeared as if they knew exactly what the problem was with my appliance. I told them when I researched the problem, it said the issue was from a specific faulty item however they said it was not. I figured they would know more than I would so they ordered the part and installed it. I used the appliance shortly after and guess what? Same faulty error! I called them back and told them I was still having an issue with the appliance and no answer. I even left a message, no response. Called again later on, no answer. Called First American (Home warranty) and they contacted them. Now they finally call back. Of course they showed up again, unprofessional as usual, and lectured me. I believe this couple has no idea what they are doing and I would never recommend them for any service.
