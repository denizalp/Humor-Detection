This is an absolutely outstanding restaurant. I took my folks here for dinner on a Wednesday evening. The restaurant is decorated beautifully and there is a nice atmosphere. The wait staff is outstanding and knowledgable. \n\nI cannot say enough about the food. Everything truly is farm to table. The calamari was so light and tasty. I had the pork belly for my main course. It was just added to the menu and I hope it stays. My dad's steak was perfectly cooked and was was super tender. My mom had the NC shrimp. She wouldn't share so that tells you right there!!\n\nI highly recommend Heritage. It's a little bit of a ride but you will be glad you made the trip!!  \n\nBest of luck Chef Paul!!
