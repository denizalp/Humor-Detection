So I thought I would give AJI a try, since I haven't been there in probably 3 years. I saw (surprisingly) a few good reviews of them here so figured it was worth a shot to stop by and check for ammo. The place has had a minor interior face lift, but is the same old good old boy hang out. It seriously reminds me of just a bunch if guys who would probably be there hanging out BSing anyways so they gave them a job. No one greets or even acknowledges you at all, and I mean zero. Had what appeared to be 1 customer and about 3 employees, customer appeared to be a regular as they were all just hanging out and just talking, 1 was on a laptop obviously busy as he didn't even look my way when I was 4 feet from him trying to spot ammo. I finally asked him about what I was after, do you have any ___? - nope. I just said thanks and left. The ammo they did have was WAY over priced however it wasn't what I was looking for. \n\nSo I agree with above as that they aren't rude, but friendly or professional doesn't come to mind either. I stopped going there 3 year ago bc I always felt as though I was bugging them to see something, even though I had bought several guns there in the past.\n\nI said then I wouldn't go back as I would rather spend my hard earned money with someone who appreciates it than someone who is too busy, I wish I hadn't stopped in today. Besides, $42.95 for cheap 40 s&w ammo 50ct is WAY over priced for me.\n\nThanks for reading.
