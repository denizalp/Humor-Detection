Been craving for bisayan food.. And im so glad i give it a try at the Cebu Inasal. Tried Bam-i baby, Cebuchon, Inasal na manok.. Man this place got it right ... It almost makes me cry how they make it so perfect for my taste..everybody satisfied and for sure this place got us from the heart... Highly recommended bisayanssssss....good food
