Food is very good. My boyfriend and I went here on our trip to Tempe, AZ to have brunch and it was super good and the food came out very quick. We really liked it, so we came back for another quick breakfast the day we had to leave to go back home. The reason I am giving 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the EXTREMELY long wait we had the second time we ate. Food was still very good but it was almost triple the wait as our first time going!
