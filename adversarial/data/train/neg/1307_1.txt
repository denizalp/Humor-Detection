I worked with Eric over a period of 5 weeks to get the right engagement ring for my fiancee.  I had done over 6 months of research on engagement rings that included visiting other jewelers in town as well as extensive online jeweler research.  I could not have been more impressed and thankful of Eric.  Wonderful customer service.  He even called my fiancee and I multiple times to give us updates on the status of the ring as well as calling us after the ring was completed to congratulate us on the engagement and make sure there weren't any problems with the ring.  Wonderful jeweler.  An artist.  Did custom work for us and it turned out beautifully.  I'll definitely be a returning customer.
