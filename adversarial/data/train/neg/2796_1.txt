Hanging out in Toronto for New Years and needed to get out of the cold so decided to pop into O'Malley's. Nearly 7pm and almost no one in the place. Dive bar atmosphere with decent drinks and the bartender was laid back. I would have given it a 3 or 4 if I didn't have to share the bar with a cockroach. The bartender did the right thing and bought our drinks after smoothly removing our friend the roach who honestly was probably just trying to get out of the cold himself. I really can't seem to find a good spot in Toronto. I'll have to keep looking.
