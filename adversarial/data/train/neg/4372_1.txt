I've order from Alexander at least 5 times a month, super friendly staff and fast delivery. food is good, nothing spectaculal. Its no secret that I keep coming back for their ranch. I eat pizza from alexander so I can dip it in their ranch.... their garlic parm fingers are probably the best I've ever had. Prices in my opinion are a bit pricey for neighborhood pizza spots, and the quality.
