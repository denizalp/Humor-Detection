I came here for lunch today and was surprised that my group found a table relatively quickly (it's usually really packed during lunch on weekdays).\n\nI ordered their daily special combo, which comes with a customizable soup with a drink. I definitely like how I can choose the type of soup and the accompaniments, my favourite is the Preserved egg with parsley soup rice with beef and fish balls. A friend of mine ordered the peanut sauce and chili soup and it tasted really good - I'll need to try that next time!\n\nOne strange part that I found was that their Passion fruit black tea looks extremely dark - as if it's a chocolate drink or milk tea. But rest assured, it is Passion fruit!\n\nTip for splitting the bill with a big group: assign each person a letter and put it on your order sheet.\n\nLooking forward to my next lunch trip here!
