I really like this place. Saturday lunch buffet is a cultural experience to say the least. I'm often the only non South Asian in the place. That tells Me, it's the real thing.\nAt least 20 dishes to choose from, plus half a dozen desserts.\nThe breads are delicious and interesting, the rice is the anchor of the plate. Veggies curries, chicken stews, some goat for the experienced.\nFantastic condiments, mint, chili, Mango.\nThe owners have been very kind to me, an old white man, stopping over to explain dishes, and even bringing things over to try.\nHighly recommend giving this place a try, delicious, clean, and verrry interesting.\nOnly advice, I wish they would keep the place a little colder.
