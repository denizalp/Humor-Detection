There were a lack of choices for the appetizers, so we asked the waitress to bring two of their best. We got BBQ Nachos and Pepperoni wrapped pretzel sticks and Fondue. Our table was next to the busiest part of the restaurant, with food constantly coming out of the kitchen behind us and patrons trying to get around them to either exit or enter the establishment. Our table was bumped several times while waiting for a long period of time to receive our food. The Nachos were ok, just to be nice. BBQ sauce on Nachos didn't work for us. The other was so horrible that we didn't even break the surface. We decided against drinks and ordering entrees. I would suggest to try the many other fine establishments around this location. Not worth the wait or headache. We are Vegas locals and will never return again.
