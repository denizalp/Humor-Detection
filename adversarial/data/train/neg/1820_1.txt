Met a friend for an early dinner here on a Tuesday night. Very small place, but there were plenty of tables available. The wait staff is really friendly and knowledgeable. I had the delicious lasagna and my friend had the Italian Stallion (all meat and lots of it!) pizza. We both had wine and just relaxed and enjoyed each other, the wine and the good food. Although I do not live in the west valley, I will find time to head over to downtown Glendale again just for this place. I still have to try the pizza!
