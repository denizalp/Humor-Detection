Great Food!!! We found this place by accident. Had time to kill before watching movie at Galaxy theaters off on Sunset and Green Valley. The wife said she was hungry and wanted Filipino food. We ate so much, no more room for popcorn and soda. This restaurant had A 'Mom and Pops' environment,  and vibe...very relaxed and chill. Kareoke available upon request!.....
