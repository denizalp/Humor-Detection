Wisconsin style Old Fashioned made with oj instead of oranges made for an odd bitter chemical tasting cocktail. Then I ordered curds that weren't good, either. Pretty sure I was overcharged for these as $14 seems pricey for curds and a crappy cocktail. Bummer because this was one of my haunts back in the day! One extra star because if nothing else at least I didn't feel awkward sitting at the bar.
