This place is awesome. Hands down. Creative menu, affordable prices, and amazing amounts of flavors.\n\nAngry kimchi fries with a fried egg on top... definitely a focal point. All the dogs are overwhelming to choose from but I was happy with every one I tried. There were so many I don't remember the make up of each and every one but if you take a glance at their menu you'll be hungry in about 10 seconds.\n\nDefinitely try this place when in Vegas. It's a bit off the beaten path and you'll need a car to get there. I've been visiting family here since I was young and let's just say it took me years to find this place. So let's hope Yelp saves you that trouble and you can try it ASAP.
