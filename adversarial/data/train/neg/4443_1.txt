This is the second pei Wei location that I have visited. The first one which I frequent often is in Newport Beach, California and the service and food quality over there is top notch. I was expecting a similar level of service and food quality but I was horribly let down. I ordered sushi and my body literally felt like I shouldn't be eating this. The sushi tasted as if it was expired and not fresh at all. A few bites in, I decided this is not for me. The server was a bit rude but that was completely overshadowed by the quality of the food. I did not even stay 10 minutes. I left my food and decided to fill my stomach at a place where the food wouldn't make me sick. The only reason I gave it 2 stars is because at least the soda was good.
