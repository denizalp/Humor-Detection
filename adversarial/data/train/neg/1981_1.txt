Just had Hydrocare Services in to clean our floors, and these guys are fantastic. They do great work and won't make you feel pressured like some might. Also they are fast (4 rooms in an hour and a half), but thorough - showed you everything that came out of your gross carpets (no matter how clean you think they are, your carpets are gross). Joe and Shel were the two who came by our place, and they did a great job. Very professional, trustworthy and nice guys. Will definitely hire again!
