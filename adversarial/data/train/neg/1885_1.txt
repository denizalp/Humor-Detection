Omg where do I begin... Jillian is amazing!! She made me comfortable the minute I met her. She took the time to listen to what I wanted to achieve and told me what my options were. Jillian recommended foil highlights vs balayage. I had not colored or cut my hair for over a year because I had a baby so she had a lot of damage control to do. I love the end result!! I appreciate Jillian explaining the step by step process to me and answering all my questions. Thank you again, Jillian!!
