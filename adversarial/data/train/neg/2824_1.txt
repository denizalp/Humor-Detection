Spitfirez is the exact type of place I prefer to patronize. The smaller businesses with quality owners and workers that put out a top notch product. I think this is my 4th turkey I've gotten here. The best. Period. Gravy and stuffing are amongst the best I've ever had. First time on the spinach balls (yum!!!) and the ham. Yeah the ham. Wow!!! You simply can't go wrong here! Add in the regular menu and catering and you got one top class establishment! Keep up the excellent work Jeremy!!!
