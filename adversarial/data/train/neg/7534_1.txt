We have moved many times and Christopher Moving is the best we have used. We have a few very heavy furnitures and glass curio. They handled them carefully without a scratch. The movers, Steve, Will, Marv and Ben are strong and very professional. They are also very fast and finished the move a little earlier than the estimated time. Very happy with them.
