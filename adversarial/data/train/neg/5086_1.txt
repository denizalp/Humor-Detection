I got a shampoo and conditioned head massage, a foot reflex massage, the ionic detox Ph balance soak with a 15 minute upper back massage. It was all amazing, the girl was strong and had a firm stroke. She got all the kinks out without a problem. She was also very pleasant in general. I don't have any complaints about the affordable prices either. This place is great!
