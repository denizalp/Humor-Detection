First of all, this place looked shady when we walked in. There was no counter at the front, and the whole place was dark. Some guy came out from the back and turned on a little light at the lobby area. I looked around for a price chart but there were none. The only thing I saw above the credit card machine on the wall was a sign showing you how much tip they prefer. When I asked the guy how much for foot massage, he said $35, I told him I read online that it's only $25 for an hour. He immediately agreed to the $25\/HR.\n\nI requested a female masseuse, so my massage started 10-15 minutes later than my husband's since I had to wait for the female masseuse to arrive, but both of our massage ended at the same time. So she did not work the full 1 HR. massage that was promised. \n\nThe worst was my husband's masseuse, the guy does not know how to massage. According to my husband, this guy would rub really hard at the knuckle area and made it very painful, while on the bottom of the foot (where all the pressure point is), he would rub it very softly that it tickles the whole time. Not only that, my husband caught the guy falling asleep a few times during the session. He would hold my husband's feet in his palms and just doze off a bit.\n\nMaybe there are better masseuse here that we don't know about, but from this experience we will not go back again.
