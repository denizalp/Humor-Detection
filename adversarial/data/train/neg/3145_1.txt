Bookman's is a really great resource if you are looking get rid of some old books, movies, music or videogames.  Bring your stuff in and they they'll give you a fair amount of trade credit that you can spend on items in the store.  DO NOT bring in old items expecting to walk out with a handful of CASH... unless an item is really coveted expect to get pennies on the dollar.\n\nSometimes it's hard to find the item I'm looking for.  They don't have any sort or computerized inventory and their selection is always changing.  The store is huge though, allow plenty of time to wanted around and flip through some pages.  At the very least I can usually leave with a almost-new magazine, marked down half price.  Can beat a deal like that.
