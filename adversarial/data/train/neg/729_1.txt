I like it. Friendly folks. Business-friendly rooms. Overall good stuff. Not really close to anything Uptown, but that's okay, you're not technically in Charlotte. You're probably closer to the South Carolina than Uptown...but Sheraton and Starpoints Starwood blah whatever it's called does a great job.\n\nDownsides: Fitness room is muggy and warmer than the hallway. Don't y'all know people get hot and sweaty when they work out? (Turn up the a\/c). Um, that's it. Everything else is very nice. I would come back.
