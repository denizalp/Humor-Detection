Town Crier appears to be an English style pub. I came here to continue some drinking with my buddies while visiting Toronto. They have a broad and thorough menu of beer varieties from an eclectic amount of countries, my favorite being Belgium and German style beers; they have both on draft and bottled beers that you probably won't see too frequently. Prices are reasonable, as most beers come in a half liter or large goblet. They also sell pub food. Would definitely come back to sample some rare and\/or drinkable beers.\n\nThe venue tries to emulate an English pub. There are older style arm chairs, small round tables, and dimly lit chandeliers. Service is friendly and knowledgable about beer.\n\nOrdered\nHacker-Pschorr Hefe Weisse wheat beer - Light drinkable beer, pretty basic. Mildly malty and fruity with a crispy finish.
