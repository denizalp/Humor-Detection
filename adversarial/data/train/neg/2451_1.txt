I really did enjoy myself at this salon. I was struggling to find someone in AZ who could handle my ethnic and thick hair, but I found someone! I had my appointment with Nikki and she did my hair beautifully. She not only answered all the questions I had but also fulfilled what I wanted to do with my hair. She also put her own little twist on it and took her time to make it perfect. The prices here are also really reasonable and it's in the heart of Old Town which is super convenient for multiple reasons. The salon is also super cute and has a great feel to it. If anyone is struggling on where to get their hair done like I was, take this from a person who was going through the same thing, with the same nervous feeling you are having and give it a try. You won't regret it I promise! I loved it so much as soon as my hair was finished, I made an appointment to come back in two weeks. This is now my go to place and it will be for a while.
