Incredibly kitschy... like, an overwhelming amount of silly decoration.  But, non-chain restaurants are few in this area, and the food here is quite decent.  The portions are large, the prices aren't bad.  (The All You Can Eat prices are high... but I can't eat that much :)   ).   They do a great job of accommodating large groups\/parties.  I'd heard the service is poor; I thought it was reasonable but I don't really like to have a waiter hovering by my table through the whole meal, so perhaps my expectations are different.    I haven't been here in the summer, so I'm looking forward to coming back in good weather to try the patio seating.
