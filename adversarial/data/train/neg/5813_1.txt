I just got my hair cut here for the first time today, and can't stop looking at myself in the mirror.  Forget about the fact that they're sports themed, and play ESPN at each chair (which is awesome).  The real reason to come here, is for the quality of the cut.\n\nThis is the first time anyone has cared about my hair more than I do.  When I told the stylist what I wanted, she offered suggestions, and flat out told me if she thought something else would look better.  This is what I've been looking for for years.  I know nothing about hair, and want the pros to tell me what looks good.\n\nThe product she recommended was something I never would have looked for in the store, but it was exactly what I wanted.  They just earned a loyal customer.
