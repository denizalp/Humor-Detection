This gym is great! Out of all the Gold Gym's I've been too (mostly in Northern California)--- this is by far the best.  The vibe here is totally different--- it seems more family friendly.  \n\nAs far as amenities, there is a full gym, tons of cardio equipment, a great range of weight training machines\/free weights, there is even a room dedicated to only women.  They also have a theater room which is jam packed with cardio equipment so that you can get your cardio done and watch movies at the same time.  \n\nOverall, this is definitely a great gym!
