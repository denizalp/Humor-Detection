It's old and mildly depressing, the walk there is in a run down casino with low ceilings and it's in the mildly depressing failure of a revitalization that is downtown Las Vegas.\n\nBut, it's legendary.  The World Series of Poker started here with one legendary month long game.  Up until just a few years ago, even after the Binion family sold the World Series of Poker to the Harrah's Corporation, the Final Table was held here too.  I believe they still have pictures on the walls of former World Series of Poker main event champions.\n\nIf you expect all of that history to seep into your game and run into great players, you're mistaken.  Binion's 1-2 no limit game late at night is a dream for even an okay player.  I've have great experiences there with absolutely rock solid dealers (that unlike some in Reno would NEVER comment on board texture) and very friendly treatment by poker room management.\n\nIt's a very good later destination with a low no limit game guaranteed to be rolling and a nice break from the strip.  \n\nI've had good experience and luck here (in the form of game selection) and I suspect that you will too.\n\nHaven't tried the other services here, but I suspect it's done pretty well.  It's that or the thing dies because you just can't compete with the spectacle that is The Strip.\n\nIf you haven't, make sure to check out the nearby Fremont Street Experience too.  Lots of fun.
