Went here for graduation lunch and the place was fairly empty. \nWhen I told the server that in lactose intolerant, the manager came and made sure the stuff on the menu had or did not have dairy in them. \nI fully appreciated The service and the accommodation for menu  items and hope I come here again for another special occasion.
