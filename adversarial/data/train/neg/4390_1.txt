This place hasn't disappointed me so far.  Well, I wouldn't recommend the coleslaw,  other than that this place is pretty good.  \n\nI always start with service,  and they have excellent service.  Manager always gets the food out quickly. \n\nAlmost like a bar,  it has a few TVs where you can eat and watch some games.  \n\nDrinks.  Only thing they have is water or house made soda such as cream,  lemonade,  and more.  I don't like to drink soda but the cream soda was recommended so I tried it and ended up taking some home. It's a must try. \n\nFood is good.  I haven't had the chicken on its own,  only the burgers and they are good.  Favorite so far is the bbq pulled chicken.  It has great sauce but if you need more,  they have sauce all on the tables.  Will be back. Go to spot in downtown Summerlin right now.
