The crispy duck was excellent.  The how Mein was very tasty.   It is not too pricy and the service was excellent too.  Overall it's a good price, place is clean, atmosphere is wonderful, and food was excellent.  I will be back.  .... Came back.  Tried the general chicken.  Big serving and very good.  Had a delicious kick and very tasty.  Also the fried rice was excellent.  \nWent back recently with a group.  We ordered the general chicken, orange beef, chow mien, fried rice, and katsu chicken.  Everyone enjoyed it.  The orange beef was a bit sweet but still by the end all the food was gone and everyone enjoyed it.  Thus will keep my 5 stars since I would do the same.
