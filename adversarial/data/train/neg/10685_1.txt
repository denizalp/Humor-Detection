This review is more for pick-up\/to go orders than dine in.  I do food delivery and this place does not have it together.  I've been here to pickup TWICE... thinking the first time was just a flake.  They're fairly consistent with their slow service.  First time it took them over an hour to get a simple order (burger and fries).  2nd time thinking it would be different (what was I thinking??)  Same thing..  somehow the order did not even get to the cook when I arrived so yes it took over an hour to get a simple to go order.
