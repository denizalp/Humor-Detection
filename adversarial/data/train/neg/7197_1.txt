This place was awesome. It was my first time there. So go big or go home. I got the wicked five meat sandwich. Delish.  I saw some people complain about how long the wait is. You can't rush perfection. So if you don't mind waiting maybe 7 mins then come here. I am a huge sandwich person and am very critical on it being awesome or its not worth my time.  Blows Jimmy Jon's out of the water. Heavy on meat not just bulking it up with lettuce. Enjoy if you try it. :)
