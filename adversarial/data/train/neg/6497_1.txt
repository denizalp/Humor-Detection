I love my ring! this jewelry and repair store in Scottsdale fashion square has a really awesome jeweler named Christopher. He redid my 30 year old wedding ring and made it better then brand new. He replaced the platinum prong setting that was missing a Pringle and the tips were worn off. He was even able to replace one of the diamonds that was missing. I am so glad I found this hidden gem. I need to bring them a bag of watches for new batteries now. Everytime I look at my finger now it makes me want a second honeymoon
