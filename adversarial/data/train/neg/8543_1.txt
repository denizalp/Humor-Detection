I went in and Jim had a welcome smile from ear to ear.  He went out of his way to find me the perfect frames.  I had two pairs made in this visit.  One pair was just not perfect, Jim made it over, so charge and with a smile, though it was not his fault.  I was unaware of a distance RX.  \nThis week I went back with old frames that I just could not part with to have my most recent prescription put into.  I just cannot say enough great things.
