I'm not really sure you should call yourself a place that specializes in burgers when the burger meat only comes medium-well.  I take that as either the cook isn't confident enough in his abilities or the management isn't confident enough in the quality of the meat to not poison the clientele.  Because of this, Stack'd automatically lost one star before even I even ordered.  \n\nThere are a few other things that Stack'd needs to improve upon.  First, while there is a pretty good Yeungling pitcher special on weeknights, the rest of the happy hour isn't really that great (only $1 off drinks).  Second, apparently there wasn't a server in the upstairs area, so if you want to order food or drinks, you either have to sit at the bar or keep going up to the bar to order.  Third, if it's quiet in the bar, there is some awful game in the back that plays the most annoying little tunes every few minutes.  To some, that might not even be something to notice, but for someone who cringes at loud, unexpected noises like that, I found it unsettling.\n\nNow for the reasons that Stack'd salvages a 4th star... The kitchen is actually open until 1 am, which if you've ever found yourself looking for a damn open kitchen in Shadyside after 10 only to be disappointed, this is a big deal.  The bartender was really friendly and made sure we were well taken care of.  There are many, many TVs (including a TV in each booth) and if you're an out of town football fan who can't get the game at home (think Eagles, Raiders, etc.), you will be able to find your game playing - and you won't even get harassed for not being a Steelers fan.  Finally, the restroom was probably the nicest in Shadyside so that wins big points with me.\n\nOverall, I would most certianly go back, but I truly hope the ownership reconsiders its policy on buger cooking!
