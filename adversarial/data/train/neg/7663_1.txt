The food at firkin was slightly disappointing.  My husband ordered the cottage pie which was sweet and served with a gravy that tasted like raw flour.  I had the fish and chips.  The fish was pretty decent.  We ordered onion rings as an appetizer and they were good but you could see puddles of oil sitting on the plate.  The beer wall concept was cool and they have a large selection of beer.  This is a good place to drink and watch the game but don't go there with an appetite.  The waiting staff was nice but we were never informed of the specials.  We were rushed into paying our bill.  Getting water refills was near impossible.
