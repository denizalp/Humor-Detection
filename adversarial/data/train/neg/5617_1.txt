Easy to catch the shuttle bus to the rent-a-car center even though it is about a 10 minute ride.  The center itself is laid out well and has all of the major car companies, and then some.  I was able to easier go up the escalator the Hertz Gold lot, find my car, and I was off.  Returning the car was also easy - lots of signs coming off of I-15 South (Exit #34).  Since there is a shuttle bus involved, make sure you leave plenty of time before your flight.
