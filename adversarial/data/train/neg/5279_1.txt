It's the kind of place that you don't notice till it's gone.\n\nVery fair prices, a nice selection (not just bagels and bread).\nand the lady at the counter was very pleasant.\n\nI got a bulka bread, delicious and addictive, some bagels (not fresh bagels near the door are discounted).\n\nThe surprize was the pizza they sell , freshly made squares can be eaten hot or cold, ask for a spicy veggie.
