I hosted a company sponsored retirement party here. The whole process was very smooth. The staff was very accommodating. The prices were very reasonable. My favorite part was the beautiful private room we used. It was in the corner of the restaurant housed by large barn doors. The space was colorful and very roomy. We had a very nice server who attended to our needs very well. The menu we were given was So yummy. Everyone liked their meal. They came out fresh and hot. I quite enjoyed the experience and plan on coming back. If you are hosting a party, I recommend having it at cantina 1511! My organization is a state agency and we are tax exempt and cantina 1511 worked with us very well! They even let us bring in an outside cake which was very kind!
