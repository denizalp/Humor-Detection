I know there are lots of places to get a good burger, but Tony Roma's has a burger with a couple of my fave toppings - havarti cheese and mushrooms, topped off with one of the signature sauces you can't go wrong. \n\nThe menu is traditional American without many surprises. The catch here is that the simple food they make tastes REALLY good. \n\nI don't recommend the brisket - not if you're used to the smoked-all-day and shredded to perfection kind like I'm used to.
