My oh myyyy! Everyone has to put this hotel down as a visit in Vegas. I love that you feel like you're in Italy when you're in here. With a realistic mesmerizing ceiling, little river throughout with a man singing and canoeing a honeymooning couple, and small shops everywhere, how can you not enjoy a stroll here?! I haven't experienced a stay here, but from what I've seen here so far.. My expectations are high and I hope I wouldn't be disappointed!
