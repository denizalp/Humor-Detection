Well... Let me tell you about All-American Bar and Grille. For one, I ordered Coffee and there was something floating in it. I had to wait about 15 minutes for the waitress to come back just to argue with her about getting another cup of coffee (arent refills free anyways???). Also, while were on the subject of the wait staff, our waitress came around maybe twice the entire time we were there. We didnt get our waters refilled, and after a hard night of drinking we really needed to re-hydrate. The only thing saving this place from a 1 star review is that the food was actually alright. Not the greatest by any stretch of the imagination, but not horrible.
