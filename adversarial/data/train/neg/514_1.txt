Pete has worked on my car twice and always an amazing job for very reasonable price! \nThe first time I rear ended someone and didn't have coverage on my own car, he fixed the bumper, hood and grille for 50% what the Toyota dealer quoted! I'm so happy to have someone I can trust to do a good job but not rip me off. That was in February of 2014 and my car is still perfect.
