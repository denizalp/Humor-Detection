Had their famous trout sandwich on an everything bagel.  Was greeted by enthusiastic young employee behind the counter who took the order and grabbed 6 bagels to go.  As he was preparing the sandwich, an older gentleman with no personality and a HACKING COUGH came over from the corner of the restaurant and asked how I wanted to pay the 19.50CAD.  Not sure if he was the boss but I was totally grossed out by his presence at a food establishment (stay home if you're sick & cover your face when you cough).  This was the only reason I didn't leave the last star because that was one of the best bagel sandwich I've ever had!  Keep the enthusiastic (and not sick) people in the front of the store and it's 5-stars.
