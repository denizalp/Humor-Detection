Ok, this is what you need to do. Go there when \"Tony Marques\" band is playing, sit at the bar and order yourself a big beer on draft, then order a fried balona sandwich. JJ is a bartender there, she's a doll and very nice. The crowd starts coming in a little later, let's say after 10. I always have a great time when I go. I was just there with my friends in January, 2017. Im definitely coming back.
