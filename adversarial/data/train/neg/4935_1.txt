Phenomenal venue and staff! The floor seating makes you feel like a rock star for sure! We went to see the Smashing Pumpkins and had a great time. Concessions include Pink's Hot Dogs, Shake Shack, Chronic Tacos, and beer from Elysian Brewing. Everything was new and modern! Extra star for the location; there were tons of food trucks and all kinds of beverages right across by the MGM Park and New York New York. The experience was worth every penny.
