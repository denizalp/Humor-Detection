I am struggling if I should give this place an honest review. It's a small authentic restaurant that's already getting too much business and unless you really are a foodie and appreciate authentic Chinese Comfort food, you won't appreciate the preciousness of the place. Don't come here expecting Sweet Sour Pork or any of those non-sense. Come for their handmade specialties. \n\nI have a few must haves whenever I go to Chou's Kitchen. Their dumplings, chive box, and beef pie are to die for. Be extremely careful when you bite into the beef pie though. The skillful food maker was able to pack all the juiciness of the stuffing into the thin layer of dough before it's pan fried into perfection. They also made their dough for the dumplings from scratch, unlike most the store bought dumpling skins, you can taste the freshness in the mouth. If you are lucky, you may even get to see the cook making dumplings\/ pies\/ green onion pancakes right in front of your eyes. \n\nAgain, don't go there expecting Sweet Sour Pork or Chop Suy! It's an authentic Chinese restaurant. Go there if you have open mind and are ready to know what real Chinese comfort food taste like!
