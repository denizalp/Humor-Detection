This place gets 10 out of 5 stars, if possible!\n Staff is outstanding, the apartment is spacious, with lots of storage room, cabinets, closets, large patio with enough room for 4 chair patio furniture, nice surroundings with good landscaping. Apartment was spotless clean upon move in, with new appliances, carpeting and flooring, fresh paint, etc. I don't have good enough words for the management and maintenance people!!! All of them are great, friendly and nice, yet very professional and knowledgeable. They do care to refer to you by your name, which makes them all very special. I personally worked with Yathaly, who is beyond amazing with not only getting the job done ASAP, but with the way she interacts and communicates with her clients. Moving in with her help was a breeze!!!  Not just her, but Emily, Alfredo and Mark are all truly wonderful and exceptionally good at what they are doing. If there is a repair or work to be done, Alfredo and Mark get it done immediately. No need to repeat, ask, or call to remind. The complex is small and quiet in a very nice neighborhood with a wealth of stores, restaurants, schools, hospital and all needed to live conveniently. Acerno is family oriented, quiet and well taken care of place, where residents are friendly and nice. All dogs are walked on a leash. There is a night guard on duty, cameras around the entrance area, lounge area and pool area, which all adds to the feeling of safety. There is assigned parking spot for residents, and plenty of open parking spaces for guests and visitors (plenty of lights at night, not just at the parking, but all over the complex). It is amazing how comfortable, serene and peaceful this place feels. Highly recommended!!!
