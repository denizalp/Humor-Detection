I had eight sling type patio chairs down with new fabric a few years ago. They were fine for a while but then the backs started to become loose on four of them. I called them to see if they could replace the spline that holds the fabric taunt, they said to bring them in. I did, but they said without a receipt they would have to charge me. I said that was fine, if I couldn't locate the receipt in the meantime, and left the chairs with them. Several weeks later they called and said I would need to come in to pick out new fabric for both the backs and seats of the four chairs, as there shop had mistakenly cut off the fabric of all four chairs, not understanding they were just to be re-tensioned. I told them that wasn't acceptable as I had four other chairs with the same fabric. They then said I would have to pay for re-slinging the other four chairs if they all had to match! Again, I told them that wasn't acceptable. They begrudgingly agreed to see if they could locate the original fabric. After a week they called and said they had located some, but it would be 2-3 weeks before they could complete the chairs. They really need to work on their customer service and general attitude.
