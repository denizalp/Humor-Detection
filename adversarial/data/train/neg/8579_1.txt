We had a fabulous experience with Dr. K. and all of his staff.  Unfortunately, by the time we got our Jack Russell Terrier Riley into see him, it was too late.  Riley was suffering from kidney failure, that went undetected by another vet.  I am confident, had we seen Dr. K. some time ago we'd have been able to diagnose the problem, and then manage it.  And we would have had our boy a little while longer.  But what we really appreciated about this office was the care and concern that everyone showed, even though they didn't know us well.  Riley was cared for tenderly while we were trying to figure out what was happening.  We had to make an emergency visit to another Veterinarian clinic over night, where we found out we were going to have to put him down.  The following day, my sister called Phoenix Mountain to let them know what happened, and that we wouldn't be in with Riley.  Dr. K. called me that day to offer his condolences, and tell me that if I needed to talk about anything with him about what happened to give him a call.  Unbelievable!  The prices at this clinic are very reasonable, we were very shocked in comparison with our other vet.  We will be adopting again, hopefully another Jack Russell Terrier just as wonderful as our Riley.  And once we do, we will be returning to Phoenix Mountain Animal Hospital to have them care for our new addition.  Thank you to everyone!
