First time here at this Trader Joe's and I have to say--I had a wonderful experience.  The aisles are clean, employees were checking the products to make sure the dates were fine (meat section), and the people here are happy!  Kris checked us out and she really made our night--her positive vibes really made us feel welcomed at this Trader Joe's.  Kudos to Kris!
