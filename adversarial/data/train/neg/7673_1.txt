Five star all day! We went today to get a couples massage and it was perfect! From the moment we pulled in the drive we felt like royalty. The room has a hot tub and a steam shower with 10 shower heads!! We had 30 minutes to use either before and after the massage. For the massage we could pick from many different types from hot stone, bamboo sticks, detox etc. The massage itself was fabulous! The smells were great, the sounds it was great. We will be back for sure!
