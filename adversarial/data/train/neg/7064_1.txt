We had tickets for the Cirque Du Soleil show \"O\" which is at Bellagio Hotel so we decided to have their buffet for dinner. It was already holiday pricing, so dinner was $44.95 (regularly $36.99 USD) on a weeknight. We are not buffet people since we prefer quality over quantity. Luckily there was not much of a wait at 6:30pm and we were able to justify the price since they served king crab legs. It is served cold but you can ask them to heat it up. Also, when there is no line up, you can ask the servers to give you a plate full instead of grabbing it at the counter. They also served snow crab legs, mussels, and shrimps as other seafood choices. They had a good variety of food from a large dessert table, to a sushi bar which served handrolls and decent poke, a few meat carving stations including prime rib and rack of lamb, a salad bar, a pasta and pizza station, Chinese food, and a taco bar.
