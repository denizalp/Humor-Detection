As promised, I returned with friends in tow. The food was as good as I remember. Right from the start, our friends commented on how good the bean dip was that was served with the chips and salsa. My girlfriend and I had the chicken fajitas and our friends had the steak fajitas and the enchilada de mole. Everyone loved their food as evident by the lack of sharing. :-)\n\nThanks Juan and team! You never disappoint!
