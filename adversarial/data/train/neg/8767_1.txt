I am writing about the COACH store that is located in the Shopping-Area of the Palazzo Hotel. I bought a purse there recently while on business travel, and the staff was incredibly friendly and helpful. A week after returning home w my purchase, I received a personal, handwritten, 2-page thank-you note in the mail by the lady who had helped me w my purchase (Peggy), as well as a $50.- gift card as a token of their appreciation. How sweet is THAT?!?!? Thank you for your very personal service, I was just blown away.
