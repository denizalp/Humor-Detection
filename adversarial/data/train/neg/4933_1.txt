I am becoming very skeptical of YELP reviews when I see that this bakery has a lower rating than Short and Sweet (on Yonge, north of Davisville) which is horrible (the icing has sugar that has not even been melted) and the Cupcake Shoppe (on Yonge, north of Eglinton) which is good, but not as good as this store.  \n\nI am a frequent consumer of desserts, as are my kids.  We frequent Phipps, Rahier, Thobors, Patisserie la Cigoyen, Charmaine Sweets, Stubbe,... so I consider myself fairly discriminating.  For cupcakes, I used to frequent the Cupcake Shoppe but since trying Bakes and Goods about 2 years ago, I have become a regular at this place.   The cupcakes are fresher, the icing melt in your mouth and the flavours delicious.  Our family favourites are: Chocolate (of course), Mint and Mocha.  My only complaint is that being a smaller shop, they tend to have less options.  I miss the chocolate raspberry at the Cupcake Shoppe, but not enough to go back.  The woman running the store is very accommodating and often will prepare my request on the spot.   She whips to the back and puts on the icing we like.  Pretty good customer service, I'd say!\n\nThe other reviewers complaining about the server being on the phone is just weird.  It is a 1 woman operation so, of course, they are multitasking.  I have always found them pleasant and responsive.   Frankly, I think the service at the Cupcake Shoppe was worse because there was usually a wait.\n\nAnyhoo, I highly recommend these cupcakes.  They are light, fresh and delicious.  I have 3 cupcakes left in my kitchen and I think I am going to go have another now....  Yum!
