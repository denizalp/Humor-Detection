So we came back and again something was missing from our order. We told the server, who said 'Okay\" but never returned. He also didn't bother to pick up the empty tray from our table.\nMy husband took his receipt to the counter to ask for his missing salad. They gave it to him but no one seemed concerned that a customer had an issue. \nLater he went to order dessert, stood at the counter with his money out but no one even looked up so we left. \nWe rarely complain, especially about new restaurants but we've had the same issues   on 3 out of 4 visits and I see that management has not addressed any of the other complaints on Yelp.\nLa Madeleine, we were excited to have you return to Phoenix but this level of non-service is unacceptable.
