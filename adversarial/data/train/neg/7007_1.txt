We visited the Science Center for the first time today.. And my kids loved it! We're from the Midwest .. So I was excited to see what this science center had to offer since it was 4 floors. Our kids are 7 and 12 and they had tons of great learning activities for them. We also seen Galapagos IMAX 3D show which I was impressed with and also kept my kids attention for 40 minutes. My only complaint would be there were alof of really neat exhibits we would of loved to do that were broken or shut down.. That was disappointing. But we will definitely return again soon.. And I'm also thinking about getting a membership for the year.
