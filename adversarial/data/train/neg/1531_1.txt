I visited Renee's Massotherapy today for the first time. My appointment was with Emily for a deep tissue massage. It was amazing!! I swear I forgot where I was for a while. I was completely relaxed and it was great! She worked some serious knots out of my back and shoulders. I'll definitely be back. Thank you Emily!
