This review is for Ashley, my therapist, and the entire team who were at the desk when I checked out today.  You will never know what you did for me today.  You renewed my faith in humanity.  You showed me a love and kindness I have never felt and it brought me to tears.  Your gesture will help me heal.  I don't have enough words to thank you.  You must be angels.  You definitely were to me.
