food was OK, drinks were OK, services were good though - everyone was very friendly and attending. \n\nthe scallop appetizer might be the star of the night, the quail egg on the top with bacon and hash brown at the bottom - i wish i could have one right now!  the shrimp risotto was alright, the shrimps were good, meaty and yum - but the risotto was a little undone... i also tried my friend's short rib gnocchi, the gnocchi was good (but filling), the short rib was definitely on a salter side.\n\nfor the side we got the lobster mash and the wild mushroom - honestly i could do without these two sides. i could not see or taste any lobster in the mash, instead there were a LOT of seemly 'canned' shrimps on top of the mash? (see pic). the sauteed wild mushroom was very salty...\n\noverall, the experience was just alright!
