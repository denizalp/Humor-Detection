I love this place! I finally had the chance to try it last night on my final night in Vegas. The reason for four stars versus five is because they don't open until 5pm. We wanted to try it two other times before last night but they weren't open. I could understand this if it was open late as an after hours hangout until 4am or so but they still close at 2am. They also don't have any kind of food menu. I think they'd benefit from something small for late night like a cheese plate or charcuterie or even pastry plate or something. \n\nHowever, I really loved this bar. The decor is warm and a little quirky with odd artwork and lamps with oversized tassels. It reminded me of the bar from The Shining but modernized and without the whole horror movie thing haha. They have a nice selection of whiskeys, ryes, and bourbons. We tried two of their signature drinks (Napoleon's Dynamite and Pina Verde) and they were delicious. Our bartender, Nick, was really wonderful. He was knowledgeable and great to chat with. We also tried their homemade fireball which was so good! It's very different from fireball and I'd describe it more like chai. \n\nThere was a live band last night and they were pretty good. The place was pretty dead though and I'm hoping that was due to it being a Monday at around 12:30am versus how it typically is in there. It really is great and I highly recommend checking it out if you're in Vegas!
