I love this place the music is jammin. The atmosphere is fun! The staff is great! It's OK for everyone to be tattooed. It just fits. The bartenders are awesome. If your group is small enough to sit at the bar, do it. The food was great.I really enjoyed the bacon cheeseburger with mac & cheese. My friend got the pulled pork sandwich. The pickles were a great flavor addition. The sandwiches come with an assortment of fries so you don't have to choose between waffle fries, potato wedges, spiral fries, regular fries. I can't wait to go back to this place.
