Food was presented very well, and I have never had such authentic and high quality indian food in a long time!  Garlic naan was super soft and delicious! Joban was our server, very quick, courteous and good service.  Maqsood bhai was the chef, and he was very courteous and took out time to talk to us and made our experience very pleasurable. Beautiful ambience in white and green,  this place is a must go to for authentic indian food!
