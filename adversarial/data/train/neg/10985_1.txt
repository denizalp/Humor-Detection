Yes, this is a copycat of the Boiling Crab style restaurants in California, Vegas, and Texas. No, it is not authentic Cajun. That being said I think it's a great addition to Madison and serves its purpose well; a copycat of the Boiling Crab style restaurants. Just tying to get my point across to all the reviews complaining about its authenticity.  I think the best item on the menu is the headless shrimp option.  I've had it many times now and it's perfectly poached.
