This place has earned five stars. We order take-out about once a week. The food is consistently high quality (two things that do not always go together) and the staff is awesome. The prices are also reasonable. It is nearly impossible to get excellent brisket and two sides for a little over $10 just about anywhere. \n\nThey forgot one of our sides one evening. It was applesauce so it was not a big deal but I did not want to drive back for it. I did the survey online and received a call about an hour later. They definitely made it up to us.\n\nMake sure to get the app - they will send you discounts and you can earn rewards, etc. More importantly, get the peach cobbler. It is amazing..
