Haven't been here in a while, wife wanted a pulled pork sandwich which we were in the neighborhood reminded her about this place, was good the first time we went but this time food was just ok, the smell\/visual was great butt the taste was lack luster. \n\n       We ordered the rib platter with brisket our sides were fries\/hush puppies & a pulled pork sandwich came out to roughly $24-, the fries were heavily seasoned with salt\/coarse black pepper [inedible], brisket was dry, ribs was fine [meaty], hush puppies were great & the pulled pork sandwich was just mediocre. The best part of the meal we got free drinks...
