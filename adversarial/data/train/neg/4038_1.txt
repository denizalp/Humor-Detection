We used to go to this restaurant a lot when it was China Tango, and it used to be one of my favorites. Chow Mein House, however, was pretty disappointing. The restaurant was very well-decorated and super cute, but the food was a miss for me. The boba drink was not good, as the tapioca balls were not chewy like they should be. We ordered the combination Chow Mein Noodle, Honey Walnut Prawns, Crab Rangoon, and Egg drop soup, and they did not taste good, that we barely ate it.
