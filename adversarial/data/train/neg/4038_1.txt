It's always nice to be in this Rooster at the Broadview location, which has a neighbourhood casual feel to it. Very different from the new Rooster location at Church and Jarvis area. \nMy first time trying out their Matcha Latte. It's creamy and milky, with a good taste matcha. \nI'm usually a fan of Cortado, but this time, matcha seems to be the 'in' thing right now. When the weather is nice, you can always sit outside overlooking the park. Beautiful view!
