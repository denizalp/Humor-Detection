Good soup noodles, but watch out for long wait times\n\n+ Soup noodles are good (I recommend the tomato + pumpkin soup base)\n+ Portions is filling\n+ Service is relatively fast\n-  Be prepared to wait a while for lunch on weekends \n\nIf you stick with just soup noodles and 2 toppings the price is reasonable.  However adding more toppings and side dishes and the price will add up.
