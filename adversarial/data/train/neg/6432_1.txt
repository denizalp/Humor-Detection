Very tight narrow restaurant. Probably seats more people than they should. The service is friendly and always pleasant.\n\nIf you're looking for a down to earth mexican place to unwind with friends with good food and friendly staff this would be the place.  I find the food always consistent, delicious, fresh and relatively affordable. \n\nP.S I love the Guac and Chips! They come warm and with a GENEROUS portion of guacamole! Great way to start a mexican meal!
