Service was not great. Our waitress was a lot older and forgot pieces of the meal we had asked for, even after reminded multiple times. The coffee was bitter and terrible. It tasted like it had been either very old or had been sitting there for a long time. The people delivering the food do not have their hair tied back. As a result my meal came with a long black hair half hanging on my plate of food. The other people in my party were not impressed with their dishes. The pancakes are oddly thick and extremely large but no flavor. The waffle was dry. The skillet smelled wonderful but the taste was not great. The biscuit that came with the skillet was very thick and doughy. The highlight of the breakfast was the jam\/compote that came with the biscuit. It was blueberry and just the right amount of sweet. Two stars, one star for the blueberry alone. For the price of this meal and the popularity, not worth it. I would not go again.
