Though I've never been to any maid cafes in Japan, I can definitely see the authenticity surrounding the cafe. For instance, the waitresses (maids) speak Japanese and replicate the polite service-oriented attitude that's very prominent in Japan. Very different from your traditional North American cafe.\n\nFood: 4\/5\n-Ordered the dessert platter and split it amongst 3 people. The desserts came with 3 generous flavour syrups (matcha, strawberry, and chocolate). My favourite of the platter had to be the matcha cheesecake + soft serve and original Tetsu cheesecake -  overall these were great :). There was also a citrus cheese cake and chocolate cake which, in my opinion, were quite mediocre.\n\nEnvironment\/Service: 4\/5\nMaids were really friendly and always offered to refill our water glasses. There's also a cute little photo booth that you can pose with your friends and the maids - you can email these photos to yourself as a memento which I thought was adorable. Also, this is one of the few places where there are gender-neutral washrooms (each toilet\/sink has its own separate small room) which is quite a refreshing change. \n\nI went here a couple of months ago and ordered a matcha parfait - definitely recommend getting this for anyone visiting soon!
