DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY HERE!!!! SAVE YOURSELF AND GO TO MIGUELS ON LITTLE ROCK ROAD!!! My husband and I went for valentines dinner.  Please understand that they were not busy when we got there! The waitress was completely untrained. Every question required a walk to someone else to get an answer. Ordered margaritas and a beer. 20 minutes later, after asking where our drinks were, we received a pitcher that was 3\/4 full of ice and tasted like plain mixer. The food... for the price, portions should be a little larger than a 5 year olds meal. Our drinks, commentary salsa and our meal all arrived at the same time!! Major WTF MOMENT!! The chicken for our fajitas was over cooked and dry. The place was trashed. Food and debris all over the floor. Vacated tables nearby remained uncleared long after guests were gone. Absolute worst dining experience, ever. \nManagement\/owners should visit Miguel's restaurant off Little Rock rd to see what a real Mexican restaurant looks like. Margaritas are good there, food is delicious and usually can't finish the meal. Much lower price.\n\nEdited on 2-19-18 \nOn the 15 someone from on the boarder commented on this review, asking me to contact the customer complaint department. I sent an email that day and in the email I only stated that I was asked to contact them and nothing more.\nI get an email this afternoon from on the boarder customer service department thanking me for my comments and they will be sending them to higher up. \nWhat comments?? Nothing was in the email at all stating ANYTHING that happened. \nThis is what trying to get something taken care of through this company is like. I stand firmly by the first sentence in the review. DONT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY HERE!!!
