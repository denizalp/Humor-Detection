If I could give it no stars I would. They market a birthday gift basket for UW students. I ordered one. I confirmed that the order was received. It was never delivered. I spend time on the phone (after no initial responses via email) and am promised I won't be charged. Now I get my credit card bill and I've been charged. So far 1-disappointed student 2-very disappointed parent 3-total time wasted closing in on an hour and I still haven't gotten on with the credit card company
