Ate lunch on the outside deck before a Phoenix Suns game. It was around 5 so I tried \"The fix\" $5 cocktail during happy hour. Amazing! Tried the zucchini fritters while waiting for entrees. The sauce it was paired with made it truly mouth watering. I ordered the jumblaya. It was a big portioned bowl with just the right amount of spice. My boyfriend ordered the sirloin steak cooked medium- he said it was the best he'd had in awhile! So marinated, he didn't even need sauce. The patio was very clean however there is a lot of traffic on the corner.. The women's restroom was also very clean, I wasn't a big fan of the lighting but it was very trendy, and spacious. With chairs and a full body mirror. Our waitress was very attentive but not hovering- making sure to refill drink or clear plates as soon as we were done with them. After being offered dessert, we were given the check and didn't wait long at all to have our card back and attend our game.
