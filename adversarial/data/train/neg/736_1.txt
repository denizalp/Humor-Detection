Went here last night after my wife's Phoenix Symphony concert with about 12 of her friends.\n\nFood came out very quickly. Ordered a Midori sour and calamari. Calamari was above average and $8.   \n\nStaff was not overly friendly, but also we didn't feel like we were bothing the server either.\n\nFun\/lively atomosphere\n\nKitchen closed down way too early (10 pm).\n\nBottom line, it was good, but not a must-visit place
