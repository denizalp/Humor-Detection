This last visit was really disappointing. I ordered the 'adult' grilled cheese with added jalapenos and a side of loaded fries. They left off the jalapenos and brought the wrong side, and I didn't get my loaded fries until we were pretty much finished eating. I expected something to be comped or discounted - nope.  And the service was apathetic. Oh, yeah, and the tomatoes on the grilled cheese made it soggy.\n\nWe started coming here less frequently because they don't have much for vegetarians and their beer selection is weak. But we used to enjoy the friendly staff and the atmosphere. This experience didn't help.
