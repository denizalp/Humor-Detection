Let me start off by saying the staff worked hard I paid for four people to bowl but one person couldn't' bowl at the time so I asked for a refund or credit the staff call for the manager to come down they never came down and the manager told them they don't give refunds or credit so they stole my money also there are no signs saying that once you pay you don't get anything back or credit next asked for the bowling balls never put back so you have to walk around the place looking for bowling balls OSHA or the government needs to check this place out so many section Codes broken would not recommend to no one
