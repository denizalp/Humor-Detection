I came here with my BF for his company dinner, so keep in mind that I didn't have to pay for my dinner at all! \n\nFOOD: 4 out of 5. This place just supplied us with what the chef thought was good. I'm a vegetarian, so they altered a lot of food for me. I first tried some vegetarian taco. It was a small taco, filled with mushrooms. It was okay. I then had a seaweed salad, which looked beautiful. It had 4 different types of seaweed salad, all in one plate. It was then topped with red, fish eggs. I then had some grilled eggplant on a skewer, which was good. I also tried their vegetable, sushi rolls, which were okay. The BF had some steak and fish. He said the quality of the meat was really good. \n\nPRICE: 3 out 5. Again, I didn't pay for my meal, but my BF's boss said the price was about $50-$75 a person. So it's a little pricey. \n\nAMBIANCE: 5 out of 5. What a fun place! They had a basketball game playing, and the crowd was cheering the game on. They also had dim lighting, with a fun architecture to it. \n\nSERVICE: 5 out 5. Waiter was good, and they were constantly checking up on us. \n\nOverall, this place is worth it if you can afford it!
