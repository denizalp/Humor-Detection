For the most part, I was impressed by the dishes we got at Spoon.  The blue cheese souffl√© was different and interesting- it was a nice combination of fluffiness and creaminess. The others I was with got the grilled avocado, which they raved about, although I found it to not be particularly special. The steak was cooked just right (Pittsburgh grilled aka a quick seat on each side).  However, to my sadness, it was a bit cold and it sat on a plain green leaf. Part of the reason I ordered the steak was that it came with a foie gras deviled egg which I had never seen before!  It proved to be delicious, though heavy, so half of the egg was definitely enough.  Bonus points to the wait staff for being accommodating when half of my party dropped out. Definitely would be a great date place in the future.
