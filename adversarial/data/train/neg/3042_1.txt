Dr. Suba and his staff are fantastic. Dr. Suba takes his time to talk with me to understand how I am feeling and has the knowledge and skill to help . He is genuine, attentive, and affable.  His sense of humor is refreshing and puts you at ease in what can be an uncomfortable situation, for some. The staff is very friendly and accommodating.  I never feel judged and I always look forward to my appointments at the clinic.
