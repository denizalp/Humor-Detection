My first review of this business was 12\/6\/17.\nNow that I found a new place to go, I wanted to share the day\/night experience.  After many calls I settled on NAIL DESIGN.  Remember that name.  I had a 10:15 appt.  I was 10 mins early.  The door was open and the owner was standing there welcoming me.  He greeted me with good morning said my name and asked if I would like coffee, tea, soda or water?  This was my first visit. I will say no more.  TNT has not been introduced to customer service.  Good-bye TNT!!
