What an amazing experience! \nWent with a group of 9 - thought it was going to be utterly chaotic - it wasn't in the least. \nThe food was awesome. I had the portobello starter & the filet for my main - both were absolutely delicious. The filet was cooked to perfection! \nOur server Dave was astounding - thanks for the fantastic service Dave!! \nAll in all, it is a must try. Eating in pitch dark - so dark you can't see your hand in front of your face - is an experience not to be missed.
