I've been following Chris (Masterchef Canada Top 5) on IG for quite some time now and always  heard great things about his cakes and macarons, so I was dying to try out this place!\n\nI came here with some friends on their grand opening day and they had a 10% off promo and they give you a 10% card off your next purchase. The store itself is tucked away in a small plaza.\n\nMy friend got me the lemon tart (not too sour and soft like the meringue melts in your mouth), blueberry tart (taste just like blueberry yogurt\/smoothie! taste better when it's refrigerated imo because it tasted more like blueberry cheesecake), and miso tart (have yet to try but apparently it's suppose to be sweet not savoury so that's an interesting twist).\n\nI really wanted to try the macarons. THEY ARE SO CUTE SRSLY. But honestly, they were a tad expensive so I'm going to have to hold back on that until I feel like splurging.\n\nMy friend also surprised me with a customized rainbow cake. The top was decorated with some mini macarons and the inside was layered with the colours of rainbow and fruits! It's so pretty and the taste was very light and not too sweet. Probably targeted towards the Asian tastebuds. Even my mom who never eats cake said it was delicious! \n\nI'm really looking forward to what he had in store for the future and best of luck :)
