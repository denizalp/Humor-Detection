I've had their food three times and been underwhelmed twice, particularly for the price. (The biscuits and gravy were good but a small portion for the price and simplicity). The food is generally mediocre and the service is slow. Pretty bland. It's possibly impressive if you're veg or vegan, idk. I would maybe go back for coffee or drinks - it is a very cute place, but not a stop for omnivores who enjoy exploring restaurants. Go to Green.
