Just had the worst experience ever. Tried to take my dad out for an early father's day breakfast and waited 30 minutes and still didn't get any food. We only had someone check on us for drinks once. I tried to order an ice coffee they were advertising and the server said something was broken and brought me normal brewed coffee over ice. We left and stepped at TJs like we should have been in the first place. Tried to give them a shot but I didn't think it was possible to get service that bad.
