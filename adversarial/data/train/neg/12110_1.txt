I am so sad to see what Hash House has become, or at least what the other locations besides the original have. \nStopped by for breakfast and I ordered the Corned beef hash which came with potatoes and a biscuit. \nThis was the one of the saddest looking \"hash\" dishes I have ever seen. A mountain of soggy home style potatoes topped with a minimal amount of corned beef and hardly any cheese. the biscuit looked better than it tasted too. the biscuit was dry and crumbled instead of flaked apart. the corned beef was bland and dry, and the cheese did not help. \n\nI don't know what kind of jam they brought out, but I put some on the biscuit and it tasted like a pixie stick. way too much sugar.\n\nNobody really enjoyed their meals this morning. What a shame.
