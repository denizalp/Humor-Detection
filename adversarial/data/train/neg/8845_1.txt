I am little late in writing my review, but I wanted to have some time to see if I love my haircut. I always love how I feel after a hair cut and would give everyone a 5 star review. The problem was I have been to a number of different stylists over the years and just hadn't found one that got it.\nWhen I callled Flict to book an appointment (which I decided to try after all the glowing reviews), I explained why  I needed someone very experienced. The problem with my hair is that I have about 10 times more of it  than anyone should have. They booked my appointment  with Amy. \nAmy was wonderful. She sympathized with my hair situation without making me feel bad. She took the time to explain how and why she was going to  cut my hair the way she was going to. I asked for low maintenance hair and that is what I got. I am ready to book my color appointment now. Thanks Amy, I finally found the  stylist I have desperately  been seeking. The salon is also very nice and  not at all pretentious. Everyone seemed very friendly and the service was great.
