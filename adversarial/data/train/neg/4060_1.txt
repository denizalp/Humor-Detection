I have been going here for years for any major repairs on my vehicle. Vic seems to be giving us the best deals and always knows what is wrong with the vehicles right away. \n\nUsually only takes him one business day to get the part in and always has time to repair any of my vehicles. \n\nMake sure you call him ahead of time because there are times where he can get pretty busy and an appointment is the best way.
