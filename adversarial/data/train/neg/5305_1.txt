Hands down the best experience I've ever had at a dealership! Richard Rollnick was an absolute dream! He was knowledgeable of the car i was seeking and didn't run me around like other dealerships had been the last few months. He got me a smoking deal on my dream car and made the extra effort to check in after driving it off the lot. Iza Shewan in the financing department was also fantastic. She was communicative and beyond positive! Such an awesome, friendly, and no BS staff. I'll be bringing my business back in the future!
