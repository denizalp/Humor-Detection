We ate there when it first opened and the pizza was raw in the middle. Granted, they had just opened so we decided to give them another chance. They are supposedly famous (with awards even) for their pizza. Why, I wonder? The pizza was nothing to write home about, there was so much oregano on it I couldn't taste anything but that, and they charged us to switch out the meat. I ate it only because I was starving. My Caesar wasn't good since the dressing (which they make) had far too much vinegar and the croutons came straight out of a box. The bread which looked like it should be good, tasted like nothing. The food is ridiculously overpriced - there is plenty of delicious Italian food in the area that is reasonable. Also, a split charge? I don't support that. And the wine list - let me just say if your food is going to be that expensive, then you should have some decent wine to go with it.  Too many TV's - why would I pay $18 or more dollars for an entr√©e to be bombarded by TV I don't want to watch or hear? And yes, like other reviewers I thought the service wasn't great either.
