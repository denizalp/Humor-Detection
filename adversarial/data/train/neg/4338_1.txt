I stopped using the shop after my transmission was destroyed by either inexperienced or over worked mechanic. When you have mechanics handling too many cars at one time errors occur . People are told come in without  appointments or are overlapped and work that may take short time is tripled God help you if you leave car you will be pushed back for walk in people. I started to notice that I would have one thing repaired then mysteriously something out of the blue would break down, simple oil changes led to needing new oil pan or something not tightened, repeatedly I would have to return to have repair corrected, leak fixed and another leak appears with explanation only a comedian could have come up with.  The mechanics if not pushed by the owner to handle more cars than is reasonable could actually perform correct repairs in one visit   maybe reason for the high turnover rate. Just purchased new vehicle which I have no plans of ever bringing to the shop.
