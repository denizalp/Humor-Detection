Located in the Cosmopolitan Hotel, second floor above the casino.\n\nThe wait on a Sunday morning around 10AM for a sandwich is RIDICULOUS. It was approximately a 25-30 min wait, where the line wrapped around the corner and into the hall leading to the restrooms. I expected a little wait based on previous reviews but when the hubs and I got there, there was only 1 person at the register taking orders yet there are 2 registers. The manager was busy refilling napkin dispensers and putting napkins on plates. You've got to be kidding me. \n\nLimited seating, you'll have to keep an eagle eye out for when someone finishes up to cop a spot. I got the bacon egg and cheese ($8) and the hubs got the cheeseburger ($10). Was it a delicious egg sandwich? Yes. Was it worthy of a name like eggslut? Yes. Was it worth the wait? Maybe. It was my first time eating at eggslut so I was willing to wait but now I've had it, Eh maybe.
