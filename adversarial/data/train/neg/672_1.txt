This place used to be amazing, I have been a customer since 2011, service was great and since I have expensive garments, I choose to take care of them it doesn't really matter the price. They made a small mistake in the past and I took my blouse back which they rectified because it wasn't handled properly. Well it's been about a year since it looks like they have a new management they're customer service sucks. The girls that work there are rude and clothes are not on time. Just today they ruined my 2 blouses saying that they received them like that, which is BS. I have spent so much money there and will never give them a dime out of my pocket. When I spoke to a manager today, she told me to come pick up my stuff and that my business wasn't needed there anymore. Talking about a professional!!!! Even if they would offer me free service I would decline, I hope someone else takes over or they close down. UPDATE!!!!I had to edit my review and continue, because as you can see the professional that is in charge of this establishment is blaming only their customers. I moved out of the country so when i was in town i would always tell you how long i was there and EVERY TIME i had to leave without my clothes because they were never ready ON TIME. So i would have to wait a month to come back from Jamaica to collect my clothes and obviously always paid, my bills were 2-300$. And all this talk about giving you a wrong name or whatever, not my fault your employees can't spell dear. Take accountability for your unprofessional behavior and stop blaming the customers as i could read in other reviews as well.
