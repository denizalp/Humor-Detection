We typically order their Chicken with Broccoli and Pork Fried Rice.  They are able to customize your order without any hesitation and the food arrives steaming hot and fresh.  The food tastes great but I am slightly disappointed in the consistency of the quality of the chicken.  The service is usually super friendly; however, one time they charged my card twice and argued with me about it when I returned to the restaurant and showed them my bank statement the next week.  I had to wait for the owner to drive to her house where she keeps her copies of the credit card receipts.  She eventually reimbursed me but I was furious that she wasted my time and I had to sit at the restaurant waiting for her to go home, and then she barely took accountability for the mistake.
