Moved back to Glendale from downtown Phoenix and one of the first things we got in the mail was a coupon for New Asian Kitchen. We were excited about it, because it was close, already had a 4 star review, and seemed to have a good potential to be our new take out place. So we saved the coupon.\n\nWe both had long days today, and really didn't want to cook at home. So it was time to try it out. I called in and ordered the orange chicken, teriyaki chicken (both with fried rice), and crab puffs, and used our coupon for free egg rolls.  They were very nice over the phone. Our order took about 15 minutes and was a very reasonable price. \n\nThe orange chicken had good flavor, but seemed to be missing a little something. It seemed like it may have just needed a little more sauce, so we will probably order extra next time. The teriyaki chicken had a little too much of a ginger flavor for my taste, but was not bad at all. The fried rice is just a basic rice and soy sauce mix, but had just the right amount of flavoring. The crab puffs were a little overstuffed with cream cheese, but can you really complain about too much filling? We probably won't order the egg rolls again, but we were happy to have the coupon to try them.\n\nOverall this place is exactly what we had hoped it would be. It's not the most amazing place in the world. But it seems to be very reliable. We definitely enjoyed our meal and will order again soon.
