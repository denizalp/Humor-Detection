I researched for a restaurant that was part of the MLife \/ MGM group hotels, which gave me 15 hotels to choose from.  I wanted something fancy and special with delicious food for a birthday celebration.  I found RM Seafood and their menu looked fabulous although their prices seemed a bit high, that's the reason for the 3 star versus a 4 star, their prices.\n\nWe were walking from our hotel, the Monte Carlo to the Mandalay Bay, which is fast and easy but once we got there . . . we couldn't find the restaurant.  What was even worse is that when we asked employees of the Mandalay Bay, they didn't know where the restaurant was!!  Several had pointed us in the wrong place.  Finally when we did find it, it was near empty at 8:30PM on a Friday night.  There was one lady at the bar area and three other tables sitting.  I liked the open air feeling and yet you could still feel a little romantic in your booth.\n\nHere's our meal:\nSalad - $14.00\nAppetizer Scallops = $36.00\nMain Entree Surf & Surf (King Crab & Crab Cake) - $64.00\nMain Entree Cioppino - $36.00\nMinus the salad our bill came to: $149.02 + $30 tip = $179.02\n\nWe had a basket placed on the table and as I went to look inside, I couldn't see anything.  I kept looking further and further inside until finally I took my hand and reached ALL THE WAY to the bottom and found four very tiny (I do mean tiny, maybe the size of 1 1\/2 quarters) rolls. It seemed silly to have this large basket with these teeny tiny rolls all the way at the bottom but they were hot and tasty.  I wont say they were memorable as we didn't order more like we do at other restaurants but they were fresh, hot and tasty.\n\nI had decided what I was going to get before I came but once I was there I had changed my mind ten times!!  Finally I asked the waiter for assistance and suggestions.  I ordered a specific salad but unfortunately the waiter brought me the wrong salad and I didn't notice until the meal ended and the check came with the salad name on it.  He brought me the organic house salad.  Personally, I did not really care for it but my bf liked it.  The dressing was OK but it was missing the things I wanted that the other salad I had ordered had in it.  There were just so many things and being I wasn't familiar with either of them, I didn't notice.\n\nMy bf ordered the scallops appetizer with raviolis and that was very delicious, probably my favorite of all the things we ordered.  It came with three medium sized scallops atop 2 ravioli.  I thought for $36.00 they could have added another ravioli with the third scallop!\n\nOur main meal, I ordered the Surf and Surf at $64.00, a combo of King Crab - four crab legs, not too large, I've had larger so these were average to me.  The flavor was good and the butter was hot.  It also came with a Blue Crab Cake as the second 'Surf'.  Usually I really love crab cakes but when they are stuffed with peppers etc., I don't enjoy them as much.  This crab cake had a sauce on it that did add to the flavor and helped me enjoy it more.  The size was that of a medium orange.  It was a good enough size I felt.  The rest of the platter was just dressing to make the platter look nice.\n\nMy bf had the Cioppino at $36.00.  It was filled with lobster, shrimp, mussels, clams, and pasta in a sauce with two slices of toasted bread.  He said it wasn't garlic bread though which many places do serve with cioppino's. He enjoyed it very much!\n\nOur servers were attentive making sure water was filled & plates came out in perfect timing.  Our server took my salad off the bill, recognizing he gave me the wrong salad. \n\nFor my birthday, my bf ordered a key lime pie but the server brought a small dish of Nutella creme brulee with a banana slice on top instead.  He brought what the house gives complimentary.  We would have paid for what we wanted but we weren't given a choice.  It was ok for complimentary.  What was sad for me the most was that when the waiter brought the desert, he just brought it over with the candle and just basically dropped it in front of me. He didn't wish me a happy birthday or sing or anything.  He lost points there and he was excellent throughout the meal.  Luckily I had my boyfriend there to serenade me : ))\n\nAll in all it was a very pleasant meal with a nice romantic atmosphere, good service and good overall food.  The value is questionable as the prices are a bit high.  I would recommend but maybe for happy hour or business lunch which is when I will return next time.
