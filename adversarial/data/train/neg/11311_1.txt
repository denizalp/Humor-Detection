Yardbird offers a very high class Southern cuisine with many dishes including some great fried chicken or waffles.  I went for restaurant week so luckily I got to enjoy many of the best dishes for a modest price.  We went with 2 separate restaurant week orders which included deviled eggs, the BLT appetizer, the fried chicken plate, and the brisket sandwich.  We also added some very good crispy brussel sprouts, though they were a little salty, sticking to the Southern theme.  The deviled eggs came with some roe on top which as very unique, giving it a nice uniqueness than our typical deviled egg.  The BLT appetizer was actually quite good.  I didn't know what to expect but it was a thick, flavorful piece of pork belly on top of an apple?-flavored has brown.  Very good appetizer.  The brisket sandwich was good for a lunch but I'd steer towards the chicken at Yardbird.  The blue plate special is their specialty and either that or a chicken and waffle platter would be my recommendations.  Huge meals in total with a side of spicy watermelon and thick biscuit on the side.  The chicken was very tasty but not out-of-this-worldly.  It is one of the best on the strip but don't compare it to some old school grandma fried chicken.  I went for lunch so I wasn't drinking, but the beer list was really good and had a bunch of solid local options.  Overall Yardbird is one of the better lunch destinations on the strip.  Prices are around $10 for appetizers and $15 for entrees which is quite good for the portion size and taste.  And restaurant week ends on June 30th so get in while you can; the $20 per meal is a great deal.
