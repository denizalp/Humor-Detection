I was just over there and it was a few minutes after closing but the open sign was still on so I went in and had a great experience. I had just ordered a Tesla Nano mod from online and was having trouble with getting it loaded and firing without it leaking out the sides. Tristan was more than happy to help me figure it out and within a matter of seconds he had it working like a champ! I also bought a large Mango Peach vape juice from him which I haven't tried yet but he recommended it as their best flavor and then told me that if there was any flavor I wanted that they don't have, just let him know and he will match it for me. You can't get much more personal attention than that. I would give 6 stars if they let me. I'll definitely be going back when I need more vape related goods and I would recommend MadVapes to all my friends.
