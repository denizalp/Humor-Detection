This review is strictly regarding the pole\/lap dance party service:\nWe had a group of 8 ladies for a Saturday afternoon party. We showed up about 15 min late as we had some trouble finding the place (you can only enter the business from the back door). As a result, our party was cut short which was unfortunate. We figured that we could simply cut out time from taking pictures to learn more moves but this was not the case.\n\nHowever, the party was still fun and our host was great! She even showed us her pro-moves which was amazing to see. It inspired me to look into these classes as a workout option. Would def recommend to friends!
