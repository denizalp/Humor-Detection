I always avoided the dentist partially because I'm always nervous to try a new places. This place is absolutely amazing!!! The office is very clean and the staff is very friendly. They let me know before hand if there will be additional costs and what my insurance will and will not cover and go over a break down on the charges so there will never be surprises. I have officially found my dentist and know I'll be back.
