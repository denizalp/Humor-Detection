This place is absolutely amazing! The customer service is wondeful, its affordable, and i can see results after the first visit! (I am currently 3 visits in).\n\nI first came in because I found a deal online and had been looking for a place to get my teeth whitened, but most places that I looked at were way out of the budget of a college student. \n\nYou can choose between regular, extra strength, or extra strength extra sensitive. I recommend choosing one of the extra strength options because the results are immediate and you dont have to sit in the massage chair as long. \n\nI tried the extra strength which left me with a little too much sensitivity so on my next visit i used the extra strength extra sensitive and have had no pain whatsoever. \n\nLisa has been the one here for my last 2 treatments and she has helped me to figure out the correct strength and time in order to avoid and discomfort for me teeth or gums.\n\nTeeth White AZ is a 10\/10 and i would recommend it to anyone who wants a whiter smile!
