I'm a big Dollar Tree fan. I am currently on a crusade to organize my home and their plastic bins & baskets for a dollar are a smoking deal. This particular location was pretty small and had almost no bins or baskets. They just had overall less inventory available than most other Dollar Trees, so I'd say skip this location & go to another Dollar Tree.
