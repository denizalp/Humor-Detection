I ate here for lunch with my friends while we were having a girls weekend in Las Vegas. We just stumbled upon this place while walking around the Venetian, so we decided to stop in for lunch. We got great service, and the you can see right into the kitchen (which I always appreciate).\n\nThe place has a southern style, and their specialty is fried chicken. Most of us got the friend chicken sandwich, and it was really good. You definitely get a lot of chicken on the sandwich, and you can order it with french fries or a side salad (for no extra $).\n\nThe reason I gave 4 stars and not 5 is because it is a little pricey. We got mimosas and they were $13 each, which I guess can be expected when you're drinking on the strip. I would eat here again next time I'm in Las Vegas.
