I love BBQ but I have food allergies so I have to be cautious when dining out.  The great part about Naked BBQ is that they make their own sauces from scratch and know what is in their product.  Great service and awesome food!  Today I had the pulled chicken and potato salad, which reminds me of my Grandmas kitchen.  The owner came to our table, Oren and you can tell that pride is in everything they do.  Yum on every Naked level!
