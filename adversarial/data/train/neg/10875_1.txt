Woke up craving a chili cheese dog and lucky for me I had a willing partner to indulge on this delicious idea with me later that same evening. We showed up at Happy Dog a little after 5 and got ourselves a booth. This time around I enjoyed the atmosphere so much more because there was no band playing or crowd to fight through; I could actually talk to my date without yelling across the table! But, if we are going to be honest here there was not much talking, more so there was shoveling of hot dogs, tater tots topped with mac & cheese, and craft beers down our gullets. \n\nI keep messing up at this place because I want to try something different so I order this fancy concoction of a hot dog and immediately regret my choice. Thankfully my date got the chili cheese dog and offered to switch with me. So the lesson here, for me at least, is stick with what you know tastes good! No need to step outside the box and put craziness on a perfectly good all beef wiener. However I do recommend putting the mac & cheese on those tots, mmm so good. \n\nOur bill came to $25 for two hot dogs, two beers, and an order of tots and I have no complaints about the price. No issues with the staff either, they were all friendly and attentive. I would definitely come back.
