Dined here with friends, lucky enough to get a table on the patio as the weather tonight was great. Started with the prosciutto and fig bruschetta, good but not as good as Postino's. Then had the toasted gnocchi, the fennel was a little strong for my taste won't order it again. Wife had the tuna and loved it. Weather was great, patio is great, food was a little off for me but everyone else loved it so overall it was a good meal.
