This is a family favorite. We try to eat here whenever we are in Las Vegas. Lines can be long around breakfast and lunch times so try to arrive at off hours. \n\nBoth the savory and the sweet crepes are fantastic so we typically order one of each and share. The Nutella banana is my son's favorite while my husband usually goes for the ham and cheese. \n\nWe have not found one yet that we did not like so you really cannot go wrong with anything on the menu.
