Have stayed at Harrah's in Las Vegas a couple of times, but was a first time visitor to the spa on this last trip. Made an appointment for my daughter and I to get 80 minute massages. Overall a good experience.\n\nOur appointments were for 11:30 a.m. but my daughter wanted to use the gym early in the morning before breakfast. She went to the spa and told them she had an appointment later in the day, but wanted to use the gym early and they just waved her in. The gym and spa are small, but very clean and all the basics are there - sort of like the hotel!\n\nA hostess gave us robes and slippers and lockers and pointed out where we could get fresh fruit, water, juice and tea. There was a small jacuzzi (which my daughter spent a few minutes in) and a steam room. But frankly we were there for the massage, not the other amenities.\n\nAnd the massages were great! Both of us felt that the staff listened to our preferences. Just enough conversation at the start to make you feel comfortable, then a long quiet massage. We didn't use the shower facilities as it seemed easier to just go back to our room and get cleaned up. But the shower area looked sparkling clean and there were toothbrushes and hair brushes\/combs, deodorant, hair products, etc. Everything you would need. Even shaving lotion and disposable razors!\n\nIf you want a full spa day with lots of time spent soaking in tubs (and you want to pay more $$) then I think the spa at Caesars is where to go. But if you want a good massage at a fair price I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this little spa.
