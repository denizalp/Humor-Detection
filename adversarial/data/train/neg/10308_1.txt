4 stars and a half! I ordered fried Calamari, lobster soup and a grilled salmon with mushrooms and bok choy in the side. Everything was very delicious. I recommend the lobster soup for those who like strong flavor (wine), there are some small pieces of lobsters inside, it's better eat with the bread they serve as courtesy. The server was very kind and attentive, I really like the service. The window view was wonderful and the price is fair for the quality of the food.
