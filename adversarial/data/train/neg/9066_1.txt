A friend and I came on a Sunday afternoon looking to get some food and play some Topgolf. They were on a wait to play when we arrived so we decided to get something to eat in the main dining area since it wasn't that busy. We were told to sit anywhere we like. The restaurant area was only about half full. After about 10 minutes of no one greeting us, another server that we saw attending tables came over and apologized for the wait and said that she would get our server. We placed an order for a Mimosa and a Pineapple Mojito, queso for an appetizer, and for our entrees a grilled peach salad and spinach goat cheese salad. In addition to receiving the appetizer at the same time as our meals, we received the wrong one and when telling our server, she seemed unapologetic for the mistake. She brought out the correct one shortly after but then we did not see her for the majority of our meal and both ran out of beverages and were not checked in on while eating. We also both asked for water whenever she did come over at the end but she never brought those to us either. We asked one of the guest relations staff at the front desk to grab our server whenever we were notified our bay area was ready since we couldn't seem to get our server to actually wait on us or bring our check. While the food was great, service was pretty terrible. \n\nHowever, the golf more than made up for the restaurant service which was why I didn't give a one star rating. The bay host was fantastic and personable as well as attentive. The game was very fun and had us laughing and enjoying the rest of our day to make up for the poor restaurant experience. I would definitely go back again but probably only for golfing.
