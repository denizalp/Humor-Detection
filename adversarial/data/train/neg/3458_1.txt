This review is for Mississauga location:\n\nI have been their loyal customer for good 8 years. The food in terms of flavor and quality has never changed. I love their sultani kabab dinner which is my personal favorite.  Their barg kabob, chopan kabab are both excellent.  However,  their chicken items aren't my personal favorite to be honest. Prices have risen over the years for sure. Buy hey! Quality remains the same good. Portions are huge and you can't resist the aroma and flavor.  Big thumbs up for Sultani Kabab. Please don't try their dessert called \"firni\" cuz it's just corn starch mixed in milk and brought to a boil and nothing else. It's just like a jello . If you have tried Pakistani or perhaps Indian then you know firni isn't supposed to have a Jello consistency.  It should rather have rubbary consistency in which milk has cooked for several hours to get thickened up and not corn starch.
