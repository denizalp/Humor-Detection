I've only been here once but definitely plan to come back!\n\nI came here with my running group and there eight of us who ran 14k with this place as the final destination on a Saturday morning.\n\nThe prices are on par with soup prices at \"fancy\" restaurants but you get a good deal if you go for the combo with a wrap (although the soup portion is a bit less in a combo).\n\nThe soup variety are not the typical ones you find in a can at your local grocery chain so you'll definitely fulfil any culinary desire to try something that's not \"run of the mill\".  \n\nI also enjoyed the presentation of the food where you are provided with a personal Lazy Susan to help you navigate your meal.  Definitely a nice touch!\n\nAfter the feedback and word of mouth, the eight of us plan to run back here but it sounds like our running group will double!
