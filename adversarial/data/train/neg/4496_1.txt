Came in during my long walk up Saint Laurent this weekend to warm up and have a light lunch. I had two tacos, one spicy cauliflower vegetarian and one fish taco. 9$ all in, and I left feeling fulfilled; I think to get full from here though, you'd need to drop quite a few dollars to make it happen. I really liked sitting at the bar and chatting with the ladies running the place, but there's a nice table if you come in with a group and the drink list had some nice Mexican beers and cocktails on it too.
