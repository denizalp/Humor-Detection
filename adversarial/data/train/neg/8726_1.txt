it seems everyone's jumping on this asian fusion fast food bandwagon.\nfrom korean tacos to sushi burritos now korean hot dogs!!!???\ni don't typically follow trends but, when it comes to food, trendy or not, if it's good food, i'm all over it!\nthat definitely goes for buldogi's.\n\ni have a difficult time giving a hot dog place 5 stars when they don't make their own dogs. (1\/2 star deducted)\ni mean, really, how difficult is it to put yummy ingredients over a pre made dog?\nnot all that difficult.\nand then, when you charge $5 per dog, well, maybe make your own dog from scratch, ya know!?\n\nwhat we had:\n\nbanh mi dog (vegetarian) - essentially it's a tofu dog on a basic bun topped with banh mi slaw and sriracha mayo.  the sauce definitely makes the dog.  without it, it'd be quite tasteless and boring.\n\neuro special fries - i'm not usually into fat fries but these are quite good. crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside.  again, the freakin garlic sauce makes this dish!\n\nangry kimchi fries - ok, not great.\nbeef bulgogi dog - the hubby inhaled it and mentioned that the bulgogi was less salty than komex.\nwest coast dog - the hubby mentioned it was good but not great.  again, if the dog was scratch made, it would've made a huge difference.\n\none main issue i had with them was that i ordered the banh mi dog, vegetarian style, but didn't receive a vegetarian style dog.\nit even says on the menu that any dog can be made vegetarian.\nbut when my dog arrived, there was pork belly all over the top of it.\nis it just me or when someone orders something vegetarian, isn't it assumed that the entire dish should be vegetarian?\njust sayin'...\nso, 1\/2 star deducted.\n\noverall, the homemade sauces and mayos are delicious and definitely make the dogs shine.\nit's all about those yummy sauces here.\nwould love to see some different buns (sesame, potato, wheat, etc.)\nwould love to see scratch made dogs, especially a lobster dog or something with seafood.\n\nall that said, the concept is good, the food is tasty and the service is friendly.\nif you're into hot dogs, you definitely have to try buldogi's!!!
