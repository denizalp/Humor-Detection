I can't say enough good things about Field Services. My $3000 preamp was making some very strange chattering noises. There was a hum in my headphones, too. Of course, this problem surfaced two days prior to a very important gig. When I contacted the manufacturer, they wanted me to ship it to England for repair! Fortunately, I had remembered Field Services in Phoenix. They had fixed some equipment for me a few years ago. I called and Matt said bring it to him. Within two minutes, he diagnosed the problem (bulging capacitors and a loose power supply connection. Matt said he would have it fixed within 3 days. I explained that I had a gig in two days. He said that was no problem. He'd have it done in the morning. The unit sounds better than it has in months. Matt is extremely talented and knowledgable. He's a genius with electronics and audio equipment. His office is neat and professional. He's got parts on the shelf. Great guy. I feel very fortunate that someone as skilled as Matt is right here in Phoenix. What a relief it was to be on time for my gig with no problems whatsover. And the cost to repair was VERY reasonable.
