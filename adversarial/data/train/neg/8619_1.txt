Had a birthday dinner with family. Difficult decisions to make when ordering from their menu as they have tons of great selection. I eventually decided on the pizza and my wife had the seafood pasta. Huge portions and very delicious. Looking forward to coming back. Definitely a hidden gem in Woodbridge.
