This is my third Cirque show and by far my favorite.  There is just so much going on in front of you and around you in combination with the music which makes it such an intense experience. I have to admit I don't get a lot of the Cirque action,but I tip my hat to those on stage who do things with their bodies that I could only dream about. All of the acrobatics were executed flawlessly and were thrilling.  Also a treat to see those very in shape male performers without a tacky venue.  A true delight for the eyes and the ears although I was picking some large confetti out of my dress after the show .\nI highly recommend this for anyone who is a Beatles fan(how can anyone not be).
