Waited in line for over an hour at 11pm on Wednesday!!  They said they did not have cars available so we had to just stand and wait. It was ridiculous with little to no explanation.  They acted as though it was customers fault they had no cars ready. Your a car rental, what else do you do other than get cars to people!?!? Will never come back again.
