I had an awesome experience when I had dinner here with my parents. We were celebrating their anniversary and the hostess greeted us wishing them a happy one. When we arrived at our table, it was decorated for the occasion - silver star confetti for their silver anniversary. We also recieved custom menus that we got to take home. Customer service was great on the phone as well as in person.
