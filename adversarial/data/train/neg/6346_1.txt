Excellent dry clean depot.  They are located at Bridal Post Plaza at the North East corner of Kennedy & Carton Road and I find the husband & wife team (with experience over 15 years in business) to be more friendly & professional than many other depots I have personally used before. I now bring many of my higner-end shirts, coats, dresses&top that require higher degree of knowledge & expertise fabric content  here for their hand pressing service. Lots of onground parkings available on the spot. \n\nGarments are returned on quality hangers and wrapped in a good grade of plastic. I can feel that they really care of your clothes! ^^
