Finally a solid pho spot in the richmond hill area.  The hills have been missing a good pho spot.  I came here today as my friend told me the phone here is as good as pho on ossington.  I'm not saying it's as good as ossington but i can say it was better than I expected and I can confidently say it's the best pho north of steeles.  The place is nice and clean and the service is solid.
