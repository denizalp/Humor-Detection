I like this place a lot.  I have eaten here a handful of times and I enjoyed all of my meal thus far.  \n\nYou have to go for lunch don't go to dinner because the seen is kind of the same and the lunch menus food tastes a lot better during lunch.\n\nI have not been there in a while but when I went I got grilled lemon chicken with hummus and it was so tasty.\n\nThe market place is pretty good, I have only walked through it but saw they had some really good looking stuff to bring home or eat on the go.\n\nRecommendation: to the people at the mall who want to have a nice lunch and enjoy a cocktail, but not for dinner.
