I have been a box rental customer at Postal Pros for 5 and a half years.  Back then the area was just building up and this was the only place around for postal needs.  They have multiple mailing options (UPS, USPS, FedEx,) and best of all is when you are a box customer, you can receive packages and they will hold them securely until you pick them up.  The ownership and staff are friendly and so very efficient!  When the mail is delivered or if you receive a package you receive a text message that they are ready to pick up. They even offer secure after hours mail pick up.  This is a very well run business, very convenient, with a great staff!  Why go anywhere else for your postal needs?
