I've been seeing Dr. Herrera and Jenna (PA) for several years, since CCM first opened. Dr: Herrera and Jenna are awesome, but they book out far in advance often. Recently, I saw Kyle (PA) and he was awesome as well. I highly recommend Dr. Herrera, Dr. Smith, Jenna and Kyle. I've seen their other providers, but none made me feel comfortable like the providers I mentioned.
