I wouldn't go anywhere else for my cut.  I moved to AZ about 4 yrs ago - Adam was my first and only stylist.  He is absolutely brilliant.  I probably change my style with just about every cut.  Adam totally gets what I think I want, interprets then translates my hair into some fabulous every time.  Love the new location!
