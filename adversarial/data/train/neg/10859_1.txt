Nice casual atmosphere and very friendly service. \n\nFor lunch, I ordered:\n\n1. Fish sauce chicken wings\n- the taste is good but a bit salty for me\n\n2. Rare beef pho with tendon and brisket\n-they give you lots of meat compared to some other Vietnamese restaurant\n- I wish the soup is a bit hotter \n- the flavour is ok but can be a bit more concentrated \n\n3. Grilled beef, spring rolls, sugar cane shrimp vermicelli \n- this is overall done well\n-they use the thicker vermicelli noodles\n- meat is marinated well with good flavours \n\n4. Hot Vietnamese coffee\n-the coffee has condensed milk at the bottom of the cup where you drip fresh coffee over it\n- very sweet!!!\n-may be too much condensed milk and made the drink too sweet and not hot enough
