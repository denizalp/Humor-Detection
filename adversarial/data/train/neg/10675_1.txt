I absolutely love this place and the staff. They're always REALLY nice and SUPER helpful. Jennifer is always quick with what I need printed and knows what's to suggest. Alex is very sweet and also very pleasant to work with. \n\nThanks guys! I come here for all my printing needs and will continue to! \n\nHeads up though, the paper cuter in the printing department should probably be replaced. Printing photos and having them shredded when I need nice clean cuts is a little frustrating. Especially when they're head shots for an interview.
