Like a true Clevelander I have been to B-Spot many times and various locations.  One thing I can say is you truly receive the same product no matter where you are, but to me the product is just a little blah. \n\nI have tried a few of the different burgers and the only one I really come back to is The Gobbler. It really isn't great, their turkey burgers are a little tough, but I keep coming back just because I like avocado and siracha mayo.  After I eat it, I am not necessarily disappointed but I am also not satisfied.  The best thing about B-Spot in my opinion is the pickle bar, I love jalapenos and all the different flavored pickles.  I would probably be better off making a meal out of that and the french fries.  \n\nThey do have a great atmosphere for a beer and a burger, so that is why you will find yourself coming back.
