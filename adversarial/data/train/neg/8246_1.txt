As soon as you walk in, you smell the awesome food. Immediately greeted with a smile by everybody and service was great.  The menu can be a little confusing, as I have never heard of a lot of the ingredients on the menu. This was resolved when the waitress explained everything on the menu very well. \nHanger steak is very good and the hummus is also great. \n\nDecor is very relaxing and good place for social gatherings.
