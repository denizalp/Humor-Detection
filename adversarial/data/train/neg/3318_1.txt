It was 9:00pm and my boyfriend and I were starving but didn't want a heavy meal nor fast food. I am a Hard Core Yelper, so I whipped out my phone to find what was in the area. Tasty Crepes came up. I scanned the pictures and decided immediately.\n\nWe arrived a little before 9:30 and there were 2 employees present. Gentleman was kind, very patient and informative. Boyfriend ordered a pizza crepe and I ordered a savory crepe. We also agreed on white and dark chocolate covered pineapples and mango! We spent around $20 for everything. The crepes were being made fresh and the smell of sweet pancakes hits you in the face. They also served ice cream and smoothies.\n\n THE FOOD WAS AMAZING! HUGE PORTIONS TOO! THAT was a surprise. We both saved one half for lunch he next day. Gentleman came and asks how our food was while we were eating. I LOVE the customer service!! He cleared our table and chatted with us. We were very delighted to have found this cute shop. We will definitely be back for more! I very much recommend!
