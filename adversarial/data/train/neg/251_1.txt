All veterinary doctors should take a page from Dr. Ensign book on how to care for your pets, I have dogs all my life and none of the Vets I know care as much as Dr. Ensign.\nEven if you live far away you should go to his clinic if you want the best care that you can get you loving pets. All the staff was caring and very professional. Highly recommend this veterinary hospital.
