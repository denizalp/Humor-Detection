Fantastic experience!! I took my Audi S5 in for an alignment and to find out where my car was pulling to the right after its was lowered. Clint did an amazing job identifying the problem and taking care of it. Not only was the shop super clean and organized but they clearly explained the problem and even showed me the issue for myself. Extremely  professional and honest which is hard to find these day in the auto repair world. My car feels great, the steering is tight and responsive. I am definitely a customer for life and would highly recomend this shop to anyone in need of honest work. \n\nThanks Joe for hooking up the members in \"Vegas Audi\" to a group discount. \n\nWe all appreciate that.
