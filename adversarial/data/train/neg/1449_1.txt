A good pizza place is what downtown Champaign has needed and Pizzeria Antica definitely delivers. The crust is obviously the star here. Chewy, slightly burnt, great flavor. The food is five stars. \n\nAmbiance leaves a little to be desired. The open kitchen, exposed brick walls, and simple modern tables are nice, but it's far too bright. Ordering wasn't bad but if I wanted another beer I would've had to wait in quite a long line to get it. \n\nIn previous reviews this place has gotten a bad rap for pricing, but I don't think it's bad. There was no option to tip so that alone saves roughly five to ten dollars depending on your order. This isn't a big chain joint so you can't expect those prices.
