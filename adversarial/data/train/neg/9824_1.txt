Used to be a five star joint. New management must've taken over because the place is ruined. Burger patties are super thin, bun is too big...gravey has been watered down...there's also one tall lady there who always messes up the orders and is super rude. Too bad. This used to be my favourite place. Now it's been added to my boycott list.
