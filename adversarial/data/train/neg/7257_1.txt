It was our last evening in Montreal and I was craving a poutine, but it was a really cold evening and I was feeling too lazy to venture out to the \"popular\" poutine destinations. So I decided to \"settle\" for a poutine at a restaurant down the street from where we were staying - Jerry's. However, it was not settling at all! Though I was very apprehensive about the quality and taste of the poutine, I was pleasantly surprised by the final product...\n\nI ordered a pulled pork poutine to go and it came to just under $15. I initially thought that $15 was too much for a poutine, but when we got the box, it was heavy, and when we opened it, it was filled to the rim! They were not stingy on any of the ingredients. The poutine was filled with delicious and 'squeaky' cheese, lots of shredded and smoky pork, and all this was swimming in a sweet and smoky gravy. We would have given the poutine a perfect score if they had held back a bit on the gravy. There was so much gravy that it made the fries soggy. \n\nIn sum: \n\nGreat service\nWe were in and out in under 10 minutes\nReasonable prices\nGreat portions\nNot stingy on the toppings\nThe meal was delicious!
