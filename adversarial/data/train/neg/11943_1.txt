I have been visiting various The Joint locations for a couple years now... This location opened up so close to my house and Dr. Roach has been treating for me for about a year now. I am a teacher and constantly have stress and tight shoulders as well as an old back injury that flares up now and then. Every time I leave a session I feel like a new woman!\nWhen I found out I was pregnant, I was a little nervous about continuing getting adjustments as my OB isn't keen on it. I was so miserable... I called and was reassured that the Dr could adjust me still. I met with him around 16 weeks and he told me that he adjusted his wife during pregnancy and his kiddos. Talk about relieved! I am 29 weeks now and have seen him 5 times so far... And I won't stop!!
