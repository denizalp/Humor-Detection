Staff was professional and friendly. Front desk receptionist was courteous and made us feel welcome right away. The environment was comfortable and calming. My boyfriend and I booked the couples Swedish massages; for the price, the length of the massage was the best deal. We left feeling extremely relaxed and refreshed. The massage therapists did extremely good work and were also very friendly. We were very satisfied, and will probably visit this place again next time we are in Vegas.
