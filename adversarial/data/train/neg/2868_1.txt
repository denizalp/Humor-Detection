This will be the first 5 star given to an AYCE restaurant.\n$17.99 a person for lunch\nSuper friendly and very fast service - never once did I have to ask to order food but instead the lovely waitress was always around asking if we wanted to order more food. There was a lot of different kinds of food to try and I liked them all. Mango salad and watermelon salad were great starters. Also like the chicken and beef skewers with peanut sauce. I couldn't believe there was AYCE sashimi for lunch + my favorite BBQ eel. By the time we reached the main course menu we were already so full.\n\nAll the dishes were small and this is the first time I would say getting small dishes is a benefit so that you can try more food. Although you can find better quality food out there, but for this price and AYCE it can't be beat.
