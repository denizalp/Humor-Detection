Took my Great Grandmother here had a reservation for 4 ended up having another person come along. Had to wait a little longer due to the change in reservation, no big deal. place was uncomfortably hot. Hostesses weren't very nice and seemed very unhappy. Started with bread that came from some special bakery the sourdough had no sour tasted like  plain whitebreak if you ask me. We ordered the filet and king crab legs filet tasted like a denny's steak, tough, no flavor, had to chew it a lot. Crab was just steamed also no flavor the butter was plain needed garlic or salt or anything for that matter. my grandma had the lobster stuffed with scallops and crab meat, also NO flavor it was all plain again with the plain butter. I was surprised it looked amazing better then the king crab and filet. Last but not least I had the Salmon under thier favorites with the dill topping. It was very small again no flavor the veggies tasted like something out of a frozen bag. Im not being harsh, I'm serious. The baked potato was probably the best thing on the plate. The appetizer shrimp was good also but that is it. Even though it was not the best experience the waitress was awesome and the environment was cool minus ut being hot. Then to top the cake on the walk out the hostess made smart remark just so I could hear it about me changing my reservation from four to five, \" thats the one who changed from 4 to 5\" like who really cares the more the better more money better tip. \nReally sucked!! Didn't want to ruin my grandmas experience but that was horrible customer service especially since we are being courteous and maintaining our smiled the whole time it was like the icing on the cake. Do not eat here! I recommend Mastro's or Eddie V's Prime seafood.
