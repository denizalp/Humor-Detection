I used to live right in this area on Gerrard Street. Before I moved nearly a decade ago, I saw some signs of gentrification (Grindr coffee just opened as well as Starbucks).  Fast forward to today and the area resembles a new Ossington, a eclectic mix of restaurants mixed in with old signage and charm of some business past.\n\nI was really excited to see a Dineen open up here, I love their coffee and was interested to see how the caf√© would fair outside of their financial district clientele.  Safe to say they did everything right.  The space has old world charm, fitting for the building it's in.  The coffee drinks, same quality as the other locations.  \n\nOn the other side of things, they also serve up charcuterie and cheese boards and wine!  I love this idea because it works so well for evenings.  The cheese selections are great and portions are generous (seriously, how often do you order a cheese board only to get a 1inch cube of each cheese?).  It's nice and quiet in the evening and the perfect neighborhood spot to just relax with some snack, coffee or wine.\n\nIf I could make one recommendation, it would be perhaps they could stay open a bit later.
