Glad I did my research and decided to stay at The Venetian. The paintings and everything looked amazing. I would go again just to look at the place. We checked in and they asked us if we wanted a room with a view, we went with it and was a neat view. Room was very large and also mostly clean. I say mostly because I ran the tub and by the time it filled there were lots of particles of dust, definitely not a deal breaker though. The rest of the room seemed clean. I would definitely stay there again. Few things that sucked is that we were tricked into a time share. Also going from the parking garage to your hotel can be very tricky, at least for us. We stayed there for a little less than a week but finally had it figured out the 3rd day. I couldn't imagine being drunk trying to figure your way back to your room.
