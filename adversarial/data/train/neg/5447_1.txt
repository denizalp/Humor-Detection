- Kept up many nights by people stomping around upstairs\n- Beer cans were thrown onto my patio from parties on the floor above me \n- Barely any guest parking\n- Pet urine\/feces frequently left in the hallway or on the elevator \n- Management changed 3 times during the 2 years I lived there and, in my opinion, got worse at each switch over\n- Current management unprofessional and rude\n- After I moved out I left the apartment in excellent condition. I then received a bill for my security deposit plus an additional amount for carpet replacement.  When I emailed about the additional charge I was told that there were pet stains and sent pictures of the stains that were UNDER the carpet they had already pulled up.  When I questioned this they told me it would only have already been pulled up if there was an odor (there was no odor, I confirmed this with any visitors I had). I think it was just time for the carpet to be replaced and they conveniently saw a stain they could blame on the current resident, regardless of whether it was from that resident or not. \n\n- Do NOT recommend, especially with all of the options there are in Charlotte!!
