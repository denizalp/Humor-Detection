If I could give it zero I would. Kids chicken tenders dry as a bone. They didn't offer to take it off the check they offered to give us something else to go. Why would I take something to go?\n\nCarne Asada overcooked. Korean beef tacos, brisket with barbecue sauce on it. Not real Korean beef tacos. Refried beans tasteless. \n\nWaitress forgot to bring our margaritas. Service was spotty. Will not be back.
