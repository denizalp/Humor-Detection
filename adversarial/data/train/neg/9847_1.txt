Dropped in here for lunch with my daughter. We each got a slice, and shared garlic knots and a soda. I spent $14+. $2.50 for a cheese slice, plus $.75 per topping per slice FEELS a little more expensive than normal, but I dont buy too many slices. I feel like most places only charge $1.50 or so for ENTIRE PIZZA toppings. \n\nAnyway.... I was happy that they allowed refills on the fountain soda. We did take them up on that offer. The employees were nice, so there are no complaints there. The place was clean too. \n\nOk, so the pizza was ok. It's NY style. When I was there, it looked like the pizza had been sitting for hours, but it turned out ok. The garlic knots were ok too, but pretty greasy. Seems I have a lot of trouble finding a place with really good garlic knots around here, so for that reason, these are acceptable. \n\nAnyway, this is a small place with decent food. Maybe a little more expensive than some others, but its fine for a drop in spot.
