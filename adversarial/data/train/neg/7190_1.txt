I really appreciate the vibe here and the mix between respectable regulars and the infusion of the dining room.. it's like being at home with no divide.. it's that humble holiday feeling which I appreciate.. I have been to plenty of bars\/restaurant and they just have yet to intermix the two so great job! My bartender\/server was doing it all! I believe her name was Kay and she had a good looking older women with her I did not catch her name but she was also moving and grooving as well so much props to those two.. the kitchen was flowing great and had no issues with my ticket time so much appreciated the open window let's me see them hustling which I appreciate even if I was waiting a little!! But that type of service I will definitely spread the word I wish the best for the future of this business and the employees whom are making this happen!!
