WOW WTF!!! this event was such a RIPOFF this year I've been to this event twice before\nthis was my third time and such a disappointment. \nI got the margarita lover deal just like I always do and got served LEMONADE!!!\nfor $6, to the point where I got sick from all the acid in the lemonade\n\n$6 for a shot of tequila?? what world do we live in?\n\nThey also said on the website no dog except the ones in the pageant\nwell guest what not true at all. This event used to be an adult friendly event\nnot anymore.\n\nWhom ever organizer this event this year is a con artist. \n\nUsed to be a big fan not anymore:(
