Neither the d√©cor nor the menu has undergone much change in the seven years since our last visit.  My wife ordered the pecan crusted halibut which came with green beans and Yukon gold mashed potatoes.  My nourishment came in the form of miso glazed Chilean sea bass, sweet potato fries and green beans.  Both pieces of fish were desirably moist and delicious.
