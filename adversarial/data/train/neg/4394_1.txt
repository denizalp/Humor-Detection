This is probably the worst experience I've ever had in a restaurant. It was on a Father's Day! I decided to treat my parents. So when we went there they told us to wait for 5-10 min to be seated. After we we're seated we ordered. It was quite busy we could tell. I noticed there were still plenty of empty tables around. After our orders we waited for the food. The time kept passing by. After 20 mins we asked our service attendant can she inquire about our food. How much longer could it take. She explained that it was a busy day. She asked whether the front reception explained to us about delay in Service? We replied that we were not informed. Only that we had wait to be seated. We started sipping water and kept waiting for the food. We noticed some patrons came after us and already received their food. After 40 minutes we again inquired if the food was ready. The waitress replied that the food should be ready very soon. After 1 hour my father just lost it. Patrons around us were done eating and started leaving the restaurant. We still did not get any food and neither we got any explanation or apologies for this catastrophe!! We received our food after 1 hour and five minutes. This unforgivable treatment made us lose our appetite. The food did not taste good at all. I still paid the usual Tip I pay for food. I realized that it wasn't the watress's fault. The management is simply horrible. I would never visit a Milestones establishment ever again. All the ways they could have fixed the problem or make up for this treatment, they did nothing!!!
