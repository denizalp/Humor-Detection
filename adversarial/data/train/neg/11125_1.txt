Pretty bummed on the experience especially knowing this chain is coming to Arroyo Grande, CA.  There was no chocolate or vanilla.  Flavors were just ok.  Pistachio, banana, coconut, tart, and some other lame flavors.  I know selection varies.  We did come late, but so what !! There was still 25 mins before closing. Fix it up Menchies -- no bueno.
