The food was good but the service horrible.  The server never smiled and was difficult to talk to.\n\nWe ordered lettuce wraps and they brought 3 lettuce leaves.  When we asked for more lettuce, he rudely said-  it's $2.  I have never been charged for more lettuce at any restaurant!  Not only that but most places bring you more than 3 pieces to start with!\n\nAfter this experience, I don't think we will return.
