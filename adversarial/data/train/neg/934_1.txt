This place is AMAZING! I love the chicken broiled pita and their hummus with pita chips. Their pita with the hummus is also amazing, but they make fresh pita chips that are to die for. I buy a large hummus from them at least every two weeks because it is 10X better than store bough hummus, no lie!! Great place fire vegetarians.
