Hands down, with no hesitation, I can tell you that this was the BEST Vegas show that I have EVER seen.  My husband loves the Beatles. I like them. This show was so much more than just their music, though! It was fun from the very moment it started, until the very end. It leaves you wanting more. Special effects, lighting, color, acrobatics, this production has it all! I was in Vegas again after seeing the show, and decided to take my teenage son to see it. He also rates it five stars. The gift shop is also worth noting, because of their awesome selection of merchandise. Bonus: hungry after the show? Just a few steps away is Carnegie Deli, and it's as authentic as the one in NY.
