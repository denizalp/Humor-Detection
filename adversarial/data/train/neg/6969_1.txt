Had been planning to check it out for a while... Tonight: Great vibe. Great environment. Reasonable alcohol prices. My server: Fantastically friendly and helpful server tonight - the type that deserves a tip, and you're happy to attribute one to her (not like those servers who militantly expect a tip for performing the basic function of their job description - at other places allllll over Toronto. Hate those types). I'd return to Trinity Common; for sure!
