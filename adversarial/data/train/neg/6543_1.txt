This place has got it down! So far we've tried the following (and EACH has been FANTASTIC): Rib tips, brisket, pulled pork, pulled chicken, burnt ends. \n\nThe rib tips and burnt ends were succulent, perfectly charred, expertly sauced and full of flavor without being too fatty. The brisket had a fantastic bark and goes GREAT with their \"Snappy\" homemade BBQ sauce. The pulled pork was surprisingly and nicely peppery and pairs well with their \"Sweet & Zesty\" sauce. Finally, their pulled smoked chicken was juicy and smothered in their signature sauce (DO NOT MISS THEIR CHICKEN!).\n\nOf their sides, my favorites were the fried okra (crispy pillows of yum), their potato salad (after the first bite, I had to take a breath and moan with pleasure) and their green beans (fresh, smoky and hearty). My husband really liked their collard greens (smoked, with a hint of apple cider vinegar) and baked beans (bits of andouille sausage, onion and bacon). We weren't thrilled with their mac & cheese (it tasted kinda velveeta-y).\n\nTheir meals are more than enough to eat: you WILL have leftovers, and are cheap (considering the amount of food you'll get)! They also have meat by-the-pound, so you can swing by after work and pick up your main protein for din-din. They're open until 8PM, every day.\n\nInside is adorable (cozy, clean, cute and good for small parties or larger groups). The staff is FRIENDLY and super-knowledgeable about ingredients, how everything is prepared\/cooked, and dietary restrictions\/recommendations. They were a young crew of good peeps!\n\nWe will definitely be returning OFTEN... I'm curious about their loaded baked potatoes and homemade smoked bologna.\n\nGood eats, yelpers! Get in here!!!
