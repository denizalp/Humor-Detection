Beautiful. Huge.  Really huge you get to work out your legs from walking to the hotel  lobby and back to your room.  My feet ached by the end of the day from walking around in my heels.  But guess what???  After 2 days, my legs felt firmer and stronger! And I didn't have to be on a treadmill! Yay!  !  I love the art in the hallways and on the ceiling.  Our suite has a sunken living room with 2 flat screen tv's.  I like that fact that they valet your car for free even if you are not guest at hotel.  I never get that in California.  They will prioritize your car if you hit the Priority Service button on the telephone in your hotel room.  It is home to Tao and good restaurants which I will write separate reviews on shortly. Yes, I would love to stay at this hotel again if I come back to Vegas.
