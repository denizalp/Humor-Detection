It's pretty common to go to Vegas with a large group. I had searched around and wanted to do a group thing here. Originally we were a little turned off by the rules and the fact we had to do a pre fixe. Boy am I glad we did.  We got to try everything. \n\nMy favorite bite was the fried green tomato blt. Every ingredient is so simple but all of them together hit every note for the perfect bite. The chicken was awesome. Probably some of the best I've ever had. Not just the breading but the chicken was just fall off the bone tender and loaded with flavor. The hot sauce only made it better which I didn't think was possible. \n\nShrimp and grits in the richest most buttery grits I've had. The other parts of it could have been better seasoned but it was solid. \n\nThe biscuit is amazingly tender and flavorful and rich. I couldn't finish mine. \n\nAt first we thought the price for the pre fixe was a little much but when you consider the vast amount and quality of food it was definitely worth it. \n\nVery attentive and professional service too. This place is a must do for your Vegas trip.
