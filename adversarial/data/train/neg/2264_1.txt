Good little outlet store with deep discounts on return merch from the regular store & catalog warehouse. Even the tags are marked with reason for return or discount. Small selection compared to regular store, but usually 50% (or more) off $$$ retail.\n\nKeep in mind - the \"no return or exchange\" policy is EXTREMELY enforced. \nBought rain jacket for $49 (reduced from $119) in wrong size by mistake, went back into the store just 2 minutes after walking to the car. \nToo bad - ABSOLUTELY NO EXCHANGES!!!\nNeeded it & liked it, so bought the correct size. Guess some friend will be getting a rain gear gift in the near future. \n**make sure you triple-check everything before getting near the checkout......
