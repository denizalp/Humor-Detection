When I built a home in Las Vegas in 2000, I had a BBQ Galore grill put in next to our pool. It functions great to this day, much better than portable units I have used over the years. \n\nWe went to BBQ Galore to buy a BBQ and a fire pit for our new home in Scottsdale. A very pleasant salesman, Ramiz, came up to us and introduced himself. He wasn't pushy & didn't try to upsell us something we didn't want. But, Ramiz really knew BBQs! He was extremely helpful in picking out the right unit for us. \n\nWe had been looking for a fire pit to go next to our pool for several months. BBQ Galore had one that we just loved. Unfortunately, it was way over our budget. We must have gone back to look at the BBQ & the fire pit multiple times over the next couple of months. Ramiz always remembered our names and was even cracked jokes with us. \n\nOn one of our last visits, Ramiz mentioned in a couple of weeks the store was having a sale but, after checking with his manager, they would give us the special pricing before the sale. Much to our surprise, we decided to buy the fire pit as it was a deal we couldn't turn down.\n\nThe fire pit was recently delivered by one guy who was incredibly strong and carried the disassembled unit by himself. He did a fine job in putting the fire pit together and showing me all of the important features of it. \n\nUnfortunately, we didn't have enough budget left over to buy a BBQ, but we will be back and will ask for Ramiz. Overall, we are very satisfied with everybody we came into contact with from BBQ Galore.
