This place rocks!! I came in here looking for a dress and found the destination wedding dress of my dreams. I can't thank the Ladies enough for such a great experience. I walked in on a Tuesday afternoon and told them I was looking for a beautiful dress, for a beach wedding and something that would really show off my figure. They knew right away they have just gotten the perfect dress for me. I tried it on and was everything I wanted! It was just such a great experience and I felt like I had the support of girlfriends instead and of sales reps. They also have a payment plan as well. Thank you Laurie and all the ladies at Brilliant Bridal.
