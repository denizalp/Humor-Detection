Mayettes is like the best aunt\/mom\/sister you can ever have or wish you had!  She cooks from the heart and it shows in the quality and flavour of the food served.  From the Filipino spring rolls to the complicated and everso delicate care-care dish, each is made traditionally and with so much TLC.  Most people order and take out, but if you have time, eat in and enjoy the company of others while watching filipino movies.  It's simple comfort food.   Price is affordable!
