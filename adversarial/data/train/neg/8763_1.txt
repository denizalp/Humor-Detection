A homey little Japanese restaurant with good amount of specials.\n\nThey may not have the freshest, most high quality sushi, but they have all the staples of good home cooked Japanese food. I really like their noodle special where you can pick a noodle dish along with a curry or katsu dish. It's a lot of food for only $12 or so. Good sushi selection of rolls but remember, you're in a land locked state... \n\nReally enjoy coming here and always want to be back.
