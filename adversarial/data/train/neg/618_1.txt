I stopped by as we were traveling through town.  I am a regular Joint customer but in a different location.  My neck is usually very difficult to adjust.  I started with a female chiropractor and she did a great job on my hips and spine.  She was able to get part of my neck, and then called Dr Scott over to finish my neck.  In a few seconds he gave me the most thorough neck adjustment I've ever had.  I wish I lived closer!!!
