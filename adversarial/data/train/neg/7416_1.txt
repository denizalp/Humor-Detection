I have used Noble Cleaners for several rentals and to clean the carpets in my own home and found them to be extremely efficient, well priced and on time!  They cleaned the carpet in one rental house that I thought that I would have to replace...they brought it back to life!  Gene and Ryan personally handle the care of your carpet.  They are honest and reliable and I heartily recommend them!
