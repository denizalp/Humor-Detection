The cashier when I ordered was super super nice and friendly. This burger literally reminded me of a shake shack burger and I was all for it.. \nIt melted in my mouth and was super delicious. Will definitely come back to try the poutines I've heard good things about. But I got the regular fresh burger and was def a fan!!
