This used to be a fish soup place and they expanded their menu to include Hong Kong style meal plus hotpot. We came for fish soup hotpot (not AYCE) and was not disappointed. Soupbase was good, but at the end it would lose the fish taste. Love the stewed intestine and lamb, and don't forget to ask for the red onion sauce. Keep in mind that unlike other hotpot places, they do not provide a good selection of sauces.
