Thanks to all of the raving reviews below! \n\nAll of the yelpers are spot on. Great food. The specialty rolls are plenty in size without skimping out on any of the fish including unagi (and you know how much I love unagi). Great service. Get the salmon tempura! They gave us a small sample, and it was the best part of the meal (serious).\n\nMy only complaint is parking. I went on a Sunday night, and found open roadside spots along 7th Ave off 14th St. Then again, the -25 degree weather helped out too.\n\nMy new Globefish.
