cust: buys season pass.. \n\nWheel mill: thanks, don't forget you can bring a friend(s) along anytime..\n\nCust: drives over an hour & shows up with his friends.. \n\nWheel mill: Front desk then says where are their waivers?\n\nCust: I wasn't aware they needed one.. I was never told.. Can we drive back, have their parents sign and send  back in? \n\nWheel mill: Nope! You have two options.. Either their parents have to come down here and sign a waiver or you have to take the forms to a notary, get waiver notorized then bring that in...\n\n-don't get me wrong..rules are rules.. But make your rules known beforehand, especially when people live over an hour away.. If your guest policy has restrictions...don't go, oh BTW you can't ride and this is why.. \n\nHopefully people will read this PSA and not get put in this same position due to a lack of important information from the company.. If your rules and regulations are THAT important to enforce, then be courteous enough to your PAYING CUSTOMERS and explain your guest regulations.. Not put the customer in a waste of time trip to be aware you RULES that should have already been known..\n\nThe indoor park is nice but hopefully no one else will have to figure this out on their own expense.
