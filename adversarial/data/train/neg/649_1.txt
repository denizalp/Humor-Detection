I tried to order a couch online to have it shipped to the store. What a nightmare! It has been less than a pleasant experience. The issue has yet to be resolved. Fortunately the manager at this location Chris Barth has been extremely helpful. She researched the issue and she called me back with an answer. She is actively working on helping me resolve the problem. I appreciate her customer service and her follow through. Because of her, I will continue to shop at this Cost Plus. I WILL NOT however order anything from them\nOnline!! Thank you Chris for your assistance.
