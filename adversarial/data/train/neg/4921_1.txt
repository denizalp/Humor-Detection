Just heading out for some Chinese Food and decided to try something new for us. How have we missed this place before. Everything exceeded our expectations from service, kind and attentive, atmosphere pleasant and comfortable, of course and the food. Great variety of Sushi , Thai , and normal Chinese Food . What a great surprise the Thai Fried Rice  was . Enjoy
