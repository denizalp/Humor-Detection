I had been to this Texas Roadhouse a couple of times before and the food and service was good, but that was not the case tonight. We walked in and stood at the host stand and were never even greeted or acknowledged when there was a host standing three feet away!!! After waiting 5-10 minutes we just gave up and left. Probably not going to come back here again.
