My girlfriend and I have eaten here numerous times, each time with their groupon. Having the groupon makes this without a doubt the best Italian restaurant in town and it's fairly inexpensive. The service is always excellent and the food is the best Italian I've ever had. They have a very nice atmosphere and it's always very quiet because the only time I've seen it be more than half full was on New Year's Eve. I plan on continuing to dine here on a regular basis. Should they ever stop accepting groupons that wouldn't stop me, their food is really just that good!
