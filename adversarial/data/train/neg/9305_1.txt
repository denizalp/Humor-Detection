This was such a fun show! I want to thank my fellow yelpers for turning me on to it. The Hubby and I went to the 3 pm show and I could tell that he thought it was going to be stupid and boring, but he loved it! We were both in awe at many of the tricks like seriously how did he do that?!! He made a bottle of Corona appear out of thin air! Very entertaining and makes you a bit uneasy because it really seems like magic :-) Also Mac King is very humble and nice, he stays around to sign autographs after the show and chat with the audience.
