Gotta love places that are just good. Just plain good. No pretentious prattling or deconstruction crap.  This is definitely one of those places.  You just know it's different when the smoker is outside next to the parking with covered picnic tables and water misters going.  Walk in the nondescript door and I'm greeted by the meat carver and served the best bbq dish in ages.  Read all the other reviews for the food.  They are spot on but the service blew me away.
