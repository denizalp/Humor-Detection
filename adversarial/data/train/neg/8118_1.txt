Stayed at nearby hilton and wanted a decent breakfast and found scramble close by. The line was out the door but the cafe relatively empty as you order then sit down. very nice fellow outside offering cups of oj and coffee.  The staff was uber friendly but points docked for atmosphere.  Super industrial cafeteria style. Ordered a cappuccino and they only come in 16 ounce cups? They don't have any other size or anything but disposable cups.. Bit wasteful. Eggs Benedict came with  under cooked cooked sad hash browns and pancakes ok.. Syrup not the real maple deal which seems weird for a place claiming to be local and farm fresh. I see that claim so often these days and not sure everyone is sincere about that.  We like to seek out restaurants serving local ingredients and There was nothing really convincing us they were doing so despite the claims on the menu.  Folks who worked there though were really great though and prices really reasonable.
