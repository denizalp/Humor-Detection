Best lunch on the strip for the price for $22.14. Monday thru Friday 12:00pm to 2pm. The best tip I can give you since I tried pretty much the whole menu is get the following if you wish to save money and get a tasty meal.\n1. Tomato salad\n2. Honjake salmon\n3. Greek yogurt martini\nThis three course $22.14\n\nNow the lobster pasta is awesome but you have to pay $15 more. The octopus is also amazing for the appetizer but again you have to pay $10 more but tender and good. \n\nThere isn't many things on the strip worth eating or paying for this is one of those hidden gems on the third floor of cosmopolitan. You can dress casual for lunch and no reservation needed if you get there at 12pm.
