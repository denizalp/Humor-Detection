My son is a year old, and we've gone to great clips, cool cuts 4 kids, and let me tell you, kid clips is the best! Scotty did a wonderful job, she was soooo patient with him. He was squirming and crying, and she did exactly what we wanted. She took her time and really calmed him down, unlike the woman who cut his hair at Cool cuts 4 kids who instead of letting him calm down, proceeded to dig clippers into his scalp hurting him. I live about 25 minutes away from kid clips, and it's worth it!
