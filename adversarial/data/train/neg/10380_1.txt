The atmosphere at this restaurant is very nice. We got a patio table it was a cold day but the heater system allowed us to sit there :)  \nFor appetizer we ordered calamari which was very nice and not to oily.\nI ordered the black tiger shrimp it was very nice but with the roasted potatoes I was a bit disappointed no flavor . \nThe shrimp was in a garlic kind of sauce marinated which was absolutely delicious. \nThe veggies on the side tasted just ok nothing special and flavorless.\nAfter that we had dessert we ordered chocolate brownies and chocolate lava cake.\nThe chocolate brownie cake came with vanilla ice cream which was very good and the \nChocolate lava cake I think was the grand finale of that evening it was sooooo good. \nSo I think I would most likely go back and have dessert there.\nThe place is very family friendly. But I would suggest if you go there with kids or babies sit outside in the patio cause inside the music and sometimes the live band can be very loud .
