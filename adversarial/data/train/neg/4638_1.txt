We had such a wonderful dinner at Nook Kitchen. We went on a Sunday evening and the hostess had informed us that they had been short staffed. We decided to stay and give this place a try and we are so glad we did! The atmosphere is great! We started off with some drinks from the bar, all of which were delicious! Our table ordered several starters and bruschetta instead of entrees. We enjoyed everything we ordered! The food was presented wonderfully and tasted even better. Not to mention, the staff was SO attentive!! We had never noticed that they were short staffed because they did a great job at making us feel like we were important to each person that came by our table. Everyone was so nice and accommodating. Once they found out it was my daughters birthday they all made sure to say happy birthday to her also  We will definitely be returning to Nook Kitchen once we're back in town!!
