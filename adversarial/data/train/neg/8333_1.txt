Whoa! This was an unexpected last meal while in town. Yelp helped me sort restaurants,  and when I saw BBQ towards the top of the list..decision was easy. \n\nThe meats here are truly outstanding. Brisket was amazing...great crusty bark and beautiful smoke ring on the tender beef. The pork ribs have to be in my top 2 best of all time, up there with LA BBQ. The sausage went down nice and smooth. Not too spicy, good snap from the casing, and slightly coarse ground beef and pork blend. That's the texas trinity,  and I never expected to have it be so good in Arizona. Bravo!\n\nSides: I tried the beans, potato salad, and grits.  Beans were slightly too thick for me. Very hearty if you like it that way. Potato salad was a tiny bit undercooked.  Just personal preference for me..i like it easier to bite through. Grits were awesome though, really tasty!\n\nMake sure to get here early. We arrived at 10:30AM on a Saturday and didn't sit down to eat till 12:30.
