This may be one of my favorite late breakfast spots for a Saturday morning. The outdoor patio makes me feel like I'm on vacation. The pesto and bread at the beginning is a great way to start. I also love the mimosas, breakfast sandwich with potatoes on the side and a cinnamon roll to split. If it's too hot to sit outdoors, I love sitting up at the bar.
