This has to be one of the best egg sandwiches I've ever tried! My friend and I shared the fairfax with the slut and their fresh OJ. It was a really delicious combination of flavors. Visiting from NY, I had actually heard about eggslut in SoCal. It came as a very pleasant surprise to see them in the Cosmo! It's probably good that I have to travel so far for them, bc I can really imagine them becoming a regular craving. It'd be to hard to resist!
