We purchased our  mattress from R&S nearly 18 years ago when they were just had one store in Mesa.  Our mattress was still great, but it felt time to buy a new mattress. So it was a no brainer that we visit R&S for our new purchase.  Looking online noted they had expanded to 15+ stores.\n\nWhen we went into the store we were greeted by CHUCK.  It was a no pressure approach from the get go and Chuck made sure to ask us what we were looking for in a mattress.  He then showed us the different mattresses in various price ranges spending the time to explain the subtle differences in the feel of each mattress and what materials went into manufacturing each mattress and the layering in each mattress i.e. coil, memory foam, latex etc.\n\nHe introduced us to their own Private Label brand of mattresses called Brooklyn Bedding, that are manufactured here in Arizona at their new state of the art 120,000 sq ft facility.  The mattress is amazing not only in how they felt, the aesthetic look of the high quality fabric that encased the mattress but also the compelling value in terms of price relative the Brand Names.  With the similar warranty as the Brand Name mattresses we decided to go with the BB Mattress. \n\nThe mattress comes with these amazing latex pillows that are some of the best pillows out there.\n\nThe delivery was timely and professional.  Its been a week now since we have our new mattress and been sleeping like a baby !!!!!!!!!!!!.\n\nWe strongly recommend R&S for your next mattress purchase.  Chuck's knowledge and no pressure approach made it a wonderful experience.
