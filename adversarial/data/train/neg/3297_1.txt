While I really miss the idea of being able to come whenever I wanted to, this gym really does have great hours. We have used the childcare on multiple occasions and the kids love it! I love being able to check in on them via the monitors. Just had a great smoothie. My son loves the rock wall and basketball court. Perhaps, I can get him to join me on the cardio and variety of equipment.
