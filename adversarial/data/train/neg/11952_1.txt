My sons and I love to go here on Saturday afternoons.  The Smothered and Covered Tots is a great starter and loved by all ages.  The portion size of mini hot dog sliders is spot on.  The chili and slaw combination on the 3 Dogs Rule is fantastic.\n\nThe service is a little slow, but I think this is rather normal for a new restaurant.  You will be rewarded for your patience.
