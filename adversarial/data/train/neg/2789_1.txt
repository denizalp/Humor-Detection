The decor and atmosphere is much better than any other Chinese buffet I've been to.  The food selection isn't huge but it's all at least decent with a few dishes being really quite excellent, such as the black pepper beef steak, lemongrass beef, and 3 kinds of chicken wings.  Dessert is a bit below average.
