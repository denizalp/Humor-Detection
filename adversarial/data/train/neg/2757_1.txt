I love this place.  My boyfriend and I usually eat at the bar here before we catch a movie at the Palms.  Our usual meal consists of the garbage salad, sooo delicious!, a soup, and the burger.  We usually split everything and they split it for you in the kitchen and bring it out on separate plates, so convenient.  We always look at their specials menu too and will branch out if we see something we like.  The steaks are excellent and the seafood is very fresh.
