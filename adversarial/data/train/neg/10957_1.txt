This Italian restaurant makes delicious food, and is so much fun (especially for kids)! Make sure you try their Stromboli - which is light, fluffy, crispy, and flavorful: the dough to filling ratio is perfect. Their marinara sauce is packed with flavor - I dreamt about it after I left the restaurant. Moreover, the staff are friendly and welcoming, and they have a lovely room off to the side filled with moving Christmas decorations which will distract kids while parents relax and enjoy their meal. A very fun, charming, and delicious place for a meal...
