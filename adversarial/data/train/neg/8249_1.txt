There is not much else to say besides......outstanding.  I just had one of the most incredible dining experiences that I've ever had in this city.  Thank you Mr. DeSchantz.....I have no words as to how magnificent of a meal I just had.  The cocktails and wines were wonderful, the small plates to share were out of this world and the steak frites were unmatched.  However, the real MVP of this night was the chocolate souffl√© with banana ice cream (we also had pavolova too....).  Prepared and presented perfectly.  I will be back over and over and over again.  Thank you Poulet Bleu and Mr. DeSchantz for an amazing culinary experience.
