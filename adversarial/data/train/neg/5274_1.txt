When my friends told me that they serve huge portion of food here, and they do! \n\nI came to the one inside Rio, we had to wait in the line for around 30min. The restaurant was not full so not sure why we still need to wait. \nThe service was ok but not very attentive.  But the food was pretty good and interesting to me. I guess it is worth for you to go here at least once to try the huge portion of try chicken waffle!
