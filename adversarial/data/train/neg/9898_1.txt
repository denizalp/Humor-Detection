Dickey's was close to home. Decided to go in and order the 2 meat plate. I paid $15.99 for 2 medium size Pork Ribs, 5 small slices of chicken breast, small cup of bbq beans and a bag of waffle fries. The ribs and chicken were good but sweet sauce made it taste better. A value is debatable, but a deal it is not.
