Amazing Hawaiian Themed Hidden Gem!!!\n\nI made a reservation for my birthday on Friday at 7:30pm.  From the moment you step in, you are transported to another world, with wicker furniture and dim red lighting. My guest and I were seated within 2 minutes and were so excited to start ordering our fun drinks!   \n\nWe ordered the Volcano Bowl to start and was told by our server that although it is meant to be shared by 4, by the time the two of us finished, we felt very nice. You even get a gong sound and fog when your drink is ready!  It was on fire...and tasted delicious and strong!! We then got the Mystery Bowl which was also on fire and brought out with the servers announcing \"Mystery Booooooowwwl\"!  That was equally delicious and very sweet.  For finger food, we ordered chicken wings (with pineapple kimchi) and a fries (which came with a spiced ketchup and aioli I believe) which were very tasty!  I also had a Blue Hawaii and my guest had Voodoo Grog.  \n\nThis place was a fantastic experience. The servers were helpful and service was very fast.  I recommend this to anyone looking for an exciting night out!  I will definitely be back again.
