I live in Madison and go to Le Tigre often. \n\nGreat place for a quiet drink. I usually open with a Tiger Beer (from Singapore) with a shot of something on the side, and then follow up with whatever suits my mood.\n\nThe tiger d√©cor is really neat. Perhaps a little overpowering in some ways. I always thought this bar should be featured in a spy movie. Good place for the hero to come in for a drink, go down the secret passageway to the secret command post, and receive the instructions for his next mission. \"Your mission, should you decide to accept it . . . . \"\n\nI do wish they had \"In the Mood\" by Glenn Miller on the jukebox, but they do have Frank Sinatra.
