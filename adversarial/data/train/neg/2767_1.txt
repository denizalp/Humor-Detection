My first visit. Ordered the Gyro Pita that comes with a complimentary soup. They were out of soup. It happens. But complimentary or not the price charged includes a cup of soup and it makes you feel like your getting cheated when they don't offer some other small token instead. Server said that other patrons had also expressed frustration in the past when it happens. Not a very well thought out way to ensure customer satisfaction on managements part. Probably figured no big deal. But it did truly cost them one future patron. Sorry, too many other nearby restaurants I can eat at that strive for customer satisfaction.\nA solution would be to add the words \"complimentary cup of soup while supplies last\" then you don't feel like it's always included, you just feel like you should've come earlier.
