Great family entertainment. I live in Vegas and have been to pretty much every show imaginable. Jeff is funny, talented, humble, and passionate about what he does. He is audience interactive and always delivers. I've seen the show 4 times and I have laughed at every single one. Belly-laughed!!  If you want something different, lively, and entertaining, I strongly suggest you check him out. Shows are early and now that it's at the Flamingo (Summer residency), it's easier to get to.  Two thumbs up! We love you,  Jeff!!
