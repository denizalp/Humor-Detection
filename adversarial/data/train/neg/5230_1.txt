Another complicated rating...let's go 3.5 just to spilt hairs. \n\nCame here for mywifey's and boyfriends birthday, due to the size of a our group we had our own area in the back which was nice. Until you had to go anywhere else in the place and it's like a new nightclub. Terrible DJ crap, and young drunk, drunk people. It was so packed to go outside was a 20 minute adventure to try and get through the crowd. Going to get shots cuz our server sucked was another ordeal. it was still faster to go to the bar for a drink than wait for our server. Not kidding, it got to the point you ordered two drinks as you would finish at least two before she came back. \n\nI didn't eat, I did notice they do say on their menu what is gluten free, but it's like 2 salads, so don't get here as a celiac planning to have a good meal. \n\nMeh, we'll see if we come back.
