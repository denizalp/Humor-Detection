Went in to get eye exam. Rushed me, and tried to pressure me with upsell. The girl had me quickly change seats back and forth for their tests, tried to take my blood pressure and didn't have cuff on right, and tried to get a reading right when I walked in door and switching seats back and forth. A person should be seated quietly at least for 5 minutes before taking a reading.  One test, she jerked my head around (I had a previous neck injury) and again rushed me and the exam. The exam with the Dr. was fine and we decided that I didn't need new pair because I need to have surgery on cataracts as the prescription wouldn't help. She suggested I just use my current glasses until after I get surgery. Asked girl upfront if she could straighten glasses. Same girl that rushed me. She grabbed the glasses, rushed again and was rough where she broke them. I need the glasses. I told her that they should pay for breaking my glasses. They refused to compensate me in anyway and tried to blame it on the frame. I have had my frames adjusted before (I have been wearing glasses for over 40 years and never had them break). They referred me to an eyeglass place. The place wanted to charge me $80 and it would take about a week. Then the girl at Pearle Vision had the audacity to call me and say that she forgot to charge me for the extra tests they pressured me to take and to call them and give her my credit card info. At this time, I have no glasses ( I have to try and balance the one they broke since it only has one side)  I will be contacting corporate. It seems that they just want to get you in and out and upsell. No customer service skills.
