just as payless , ez, and fox. don't rent using carrentals.com or priceline.com!!!!  Haggle, haggle, haggle!!  CANNOT REALLY CANCEL A RESERVATION SINCE IT WAS COMPLETED BY A THIRD PARTY BROKER. \n\nArranged for a \"Maxima\" like car and was told \" ...there are no premiums. You'll have to take either a Corolla for same price, minivan, or SUBURBAN!\"  Of course at 2 tomes the original price. Persistence was successful- SURPRISE- a premium car came available.
