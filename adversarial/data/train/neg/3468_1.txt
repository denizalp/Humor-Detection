I used to wear glasses since I was a little girl and I got my Lasik done with Nevada Eye Care. It took me a long time to make the decision however it was the best decision I have ever made. I thank Dr. Park and the whole staff for everything.It has really changed my life, best technology in Las Vegas hands down. Best of all the consultation is free no obligation to anything. Highly recommend!
