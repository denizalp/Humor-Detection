We had an excellent meal of Argentinean BBQ (parillada) and empanadas-- the natural grilled meat flavors and texture were just right. It loses a star with me because the service was a touch slow (the restaurant was maybe a quarter full is all) and the vegetables ordered as sides were weak. (In order to carry as a side dish of their own, a plate of summertime tomatoes absolutely should not taste like weak winter tomatoes. The fried potatoes weren't quite \"there\" in their texture--a little soggy.) And the portions were just a touch small for the price. Still, the parillada was a good eating experience and we'd come back for that.
