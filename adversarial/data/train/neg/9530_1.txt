Amazing burrito. After walking around downtown at 11:30pm on a Saturday night with very little luck finding an open restaurant, we stumbled upon Burrito Boyz (open until 4am I believe). Unfortunately, walking down the street was difficult as we had to fight through the crowds of club-goers. For $21 total, we got two drinks, two orders of chips & guacamole, and two burritos (steak and chicken). Only complaint is the ratio of guac to chips. Taking modest scoops, I finished my guacamole not even halfway into my order of chips. Translation: This is the place to go if you take very small bites of guacamole. Despite that, the guacamole was very good, the burrito was better. I got everything on my burrito (they have a pretty good sized topping list) and the tortilla held strong. Doing the same at Chipotle, I would probably get one bite in before the tortilla fell apart. This place is great.
