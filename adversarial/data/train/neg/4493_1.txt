I've been to TLR a couple times and it's usually a great experience. This time it was subpar. We came in on a Thursday about 90 minutes before close. There wasn't a crowd just about 3 or 4 tables but we were hardly tended to and when we were the waitress wasn't very pleasant and forgot to give us menus and brought the wrong drink. I normally am really understanding of forgetting things but she wasn't pleasant and just seemed to want to rush us out....other than that it's a great place for ambiance and nice wine selection but you can't always count on superior service.  The other staff we encountered were gracious our waitress just seemed like she didn't care.
