This is my favorite breakfast spot in Vegas.  Everything on the menu is awesome.  I personally like the gaucho sandwich with the waygu beef and my fiance loves the original slut (the one in the jar). The only negative is that the line starts before they open and stays pretty steady for the whole day.
