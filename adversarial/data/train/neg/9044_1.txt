Adorable Burros- Horrible Customer Service\n\nI waited quite awhile before I wrote this review as I was severely irritated right after the incident..\nI contacted this business to inquire about their services on initially on 3-4-14. \n\nOn 5-20 I had worked out the logistics\/ got the appropriate permissions from our wedding venue and told Vanessa that I would like to book two Burros. \n\nOne month before our wedding date I received an e-mail from Vanessa letting me know that they had me as a tentative hold and that they needed the contract finalized. Over the next couple days we worked out the specifics as far as timing would go. \n\nOn October 1st I received an e-mail from Vanessa saying that they had overbooked and would only have one Burro available- to try and make it right they offered us their \"photo option\". \nOn October 5th Vanessa sent me a pay pal invoice and it and the contract were returned on the same day. \n\nThe day of the event came (10\/18) and even though the Burros were my fiancé's \"groom gift\" (When I initially spoke with Vanessa on the phone I let her know) he never got to see them.  \nFrom the day after the wedding(10\/19) my fiancé and I were traveling on our honeymoon and had very little internet access. (what internet  we did have was unsecure). \n\nWhen I got back to internet access I had no less than 6 e-mails with progressively rude comments from Vanessa letting me know that she had expected payment on the day of the event.  Shame on me for not getting it to her... though it would have been a lot easier to pay her IF I HAD SEEN HER. Good thing she left without us literally ever laying eyes on the burros. I have never left a bill unpaid in my entire life and considering that I paid her the deposit the day she sent the invoice she should have had a clue about my character. \n\nAs for the photo option- I am glad that I didn't pay for it.. We got approximately 50 photos with at least a quarter of the photos blurry\/people not looking at the camera\/the ground.. great stuff. Luckily a lot of guests took their own photos with their camera phones.\n\nWith all of that being said all of the guests loved the burros.... Good luck if you book with these people.\n\nEDITED TO RESPOND TO BUSINESS OWNER---\n\nVanessa,\n\nYou have got to be kidding me. You were unaware that I was unhappy with your service?? I told you that the whole reason we had the burros was for my husband to enjoy and you didn't bother to come see us (though you were asked to) and then you complained that I didn't pay you soon enough even though I let you know why...unbelievable (off the continent\/ unsecured internet). You took down my photo gallery or I would link it here.  I am not sure how you counted 70 photos...(I cant help but notice all of the reviews you asked for from other customers feature a photo of them with the burro-- something we don't have). As for the six e-mails that appeared to come from you- I would be entirely happy to send you a screen shot if you would like. You were paid prior to the event.. half up front. I would be happy to forward you that e-mail if you would like as well.\n\nAs far as calling my wedding \"low budget and disorganized\"... you are a true class act lady. So sorry that we didn't get married at the Ritz. Lastly as far as \"being no where in sight\"- yes, as is traditional- we were taking photos. As outlined in the timeline- I requested from the burros be with us from 5- 5:15 so that we could see them\/take photos.. that didn't happen. And the beer? You are correct- it wasn't where it was supposed to be--turns out delivery guys get a little lost when they deliver to a 92 acre facility (even with clear instructions).\n\nOver all I am just in awe that you went to the lengths to call our wedding low budget and disorganized.... true class ma'am, true class.\n\nThe point of my post? I was trying to give a clear understanding with timeline... the exact point though- LOVED the burros- the guests raved about them. The customer service was poor... further demonstrated by your response.
