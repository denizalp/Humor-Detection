Came here for a Sunday lunch! Small space but quick turnover. Once you find your own seat, you can check mark what you want to order on the laminated menus and hand it back to the server. \n\nI highly recommend the  original sandwich ! Succulent and tasty pork loin w juicy sauces and toppings in between three delicious milk toasts! I gobbled it up within seconds! The milk bread was also amazing and definitely unique. So so so tasty! I'm so excited to try their other sandwiches. \n\nSecond up, definitely try their Malaysian laksa. It was not spicy at all but it was really close to the laksa I had in Singapore at a restaurant called toast box haha. Same toppings w bean sprouts, tofu poc, and coconut and spicy base! The noodles were probably slightly different but the laksa at Breakfast ing definitely had a lot more\nFlavour that the other places that I have been to in Toronto. So if you are in the area, check it out. I'm still thinking about the tasty soup! \n\nWe also got the Malaysian pork bone soup.. which was lacking taste and flavour. Good noodles though! \n\nIf only they had more drink varieties and a less expensive price ! \n\nAmbiance : Like an Asian fusion quick in and out cafe. \nService : Good. Food comes out quickly and fresh. \nFood quality: Excellent! We need something like this in the area :)\nPrice: $$
