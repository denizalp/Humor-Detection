Placed an order for pick up at 6:30pm. I was told food would be ready in 20-25 minutes. I get there at 7 and food was not ready until 7:30pm! On top of that my food was cold and overcooked as the chicken wings and garlic bread were burnt! If it takes longer, then say so! And if it does take that long, make sure it taste good and warm!  How are you \"Best of LV\"? Definitely not this location!
