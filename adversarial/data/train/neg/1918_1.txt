Unfortunately I came here and was never served so the rating is for the service only. Maybe the food is good but I will never know because I won't be back. They have no host so you seat yourself and hope that someone remembers what order you arrived in. We sat and waited and the server skipped us numerous times. We wanted to stop somewhere for a quick lunch near the hospital so if that is your goal As well I would recommend going elsewhere.
