I really can't say enough great things about this box! I am visiting in the Las Vegas area and needed to drop in for a few days.  I am SO impressed!  Even though I'm an older Crossfitter and have a very long way to go, the coaches, owners, and athletes have all been absolutely amazing! It is a small, friendly, extremely supportive environment.  If you're looking for a Crossfit box, you need not look any farther; they're awesome!
