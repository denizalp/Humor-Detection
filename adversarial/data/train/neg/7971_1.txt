I highly recommend it for their great Tiki ambiance! From Drink list to the music it is great! The serviceis also very good! The only thing is that the food is mehhh! We tried 3 different items from the snacks menu and 3 other for main plate. I suggest eating elsewhere before but surely don't pass the opportunity to go get a drink of few after dinner! Great time for sure!
