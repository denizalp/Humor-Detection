I came back 3 hours later with no valet person and no keys. We checked our car around 7pm and came back at 10:30 it was indicated on our claim ticket that there would be a note left on our car if we came back outside of business hours (not indicated) a note would be left on the windshield with where to claim our keys. Unfortunately it appears there was no such note and none of the surrounding bars\/restaurants have any idea who takes keys for this valet service. Thankfully they got our voicemail and are delivering the car back to our home. Stinks it happened but the follow up was great!
