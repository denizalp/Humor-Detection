Sweet Moses, while your ice cream is rich and delicious, it always seems to wage war with my gastrointestinal tract. So I am not going to focus on your ice cream but rather the things there that I can digest.\n\nLike your lemon sorbet. The sweet, tart, refreshing, perfect on a scorching hot day lemon sorbet.\n\nWant a really good tip one of the soda jerks gave me? Get the lemon sorbet instead of ice cream in a pomegranate or raspberry \"ice cream\" soda. Holy refreshingness, Batman!! \n\nOther favorites:\n-The mixed caramel, cheese and buttered popcorn. It sounds weird, I know, but it is completely addictive! \n-Homemade taffy! Woot!\n-The adorable old fashioned soda shop style bar.\n\nNot-so-favorites:\n-The lack of seats and legroom at the soda bar. I'm only 5'6\" and I felt like I had to sit sideways to save my knees.\n-The lack of room for large parties. I went with a party of 6 and we had to commandeer two tables, which I felt horrible about given the lack of seating anyway.
