Very efficient at the Doctor level. No nonsense. Very straightforward. Lots of test results today and lots of 28-letter medical terms which were explained in very plain layman's language. I had 2 nurse assistants. The first one, new to me, did an excellent job of taking my vitals and was very friendly. (Very tall too!) My usual nurse, of the Dr.G\/Nurse Y combo, returned from lunch and processed my outbound paperwork and external specialist recommendation -- all the time with a delightful smile and caring attitude. Very caring. She's very special.\n\nWhen I arrived (early for my appt.) there were probably 10-12 others in the waiting area (Cheyenne location). So I knew they were busy. I had about a 30 minute, after the designated appointment time, wait. Of course, trying to stay on time is a challenge. I have no idea what are considered \"best practices\" for running such a busy professional medical office, but I'm sure there are some kind of time study specialists that could offer suggestions for improvement. I've just come to expect to wait. I don't mind. I do imagine though that other patients may not be so liberal and may have time constraints of their own to deal with in their daily lives' activities.\n\nAs to the others' comments about the front office, all I can say is that I was received very politely, with a smile and a pleasant greeting. Paid and got my paid receipt also processed professionally, politely, and also with a smile. \n\nIn a word: delightful!
