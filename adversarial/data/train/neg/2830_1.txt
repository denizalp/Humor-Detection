I wanted to update my review. I've stayed here multiple times, all different lengths of stays, and I feel this place needs another one. I booked a particularly long review and upon check in, the woman at the front desk handed me my keys and said \"welcome to the family\" with a smile. What a great beginning to our stay! The room was perfect, the A\/C was ice cold when I needed it to be, the amount of drawers and other places for storage came in handy! Within a day or two, everyone at the front desk greeted me by name. There customer service is OUTSTANDING! They took care of any problem immediately and really seemed to care. I can't wait to be back. The pool area is always spotless too. Thanks Candlewood! We'll be back soon.
