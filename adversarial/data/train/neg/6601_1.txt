I've brought three cars for servicing to this AAMCO and have been extremely pleased with the honesty, integrity, and customer service I received.  There were times when I thought major repairs were going to be needed, and they could had taken advantage of me, but did not.  It is great to know I can take my cars to them and won't get ripped off.
