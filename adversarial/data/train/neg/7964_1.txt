Just because this place was on Triple D, doesn't excuse the fact that the service is usually pretty poor, the food is over priced and the quality is average.  My fiance and I came for breakfast on 10\/2\/2011, and we waited for 5 minutes for someone to wait on us. Another 10 to get our order taken, and when our food finally came, we had no silverware to eat with. Other 5 minutes to get that, and finally we could eat.  Don't think this isn't the norm, it is. I told my fiance that this is the last time we come here. I'm over it.\nAs for price, two coffee's, a veggie omelet, and breakfast tacos $20. Overpriced, underwhelmed, and poor service, don't mix. Save yourself a trip and skip Kelly O's.
