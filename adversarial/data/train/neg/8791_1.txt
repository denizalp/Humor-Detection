I went in for the health food store, the chiropractors may be great, but the service in the health food store leaves something to be desired. Not very friendly not very helpful. Yes they did answer my questions and they do have some great products. But who would not have electrolyte mix at a combination health food store and chiropractic office? As a massage therapist for 25 years I find most people are lacking in electrolytes and that's often what they need for leg cramps. But the woman was more concerned with helping the person she knew, than helping me, the new customer. Sorry folks I can't give you a good rating on this one. I would rate in the negative range if I could.
