John did my nails and I was very pleased with them. However, I did ask for Henry because someone referred me to the salon based on his work. I feel they should have told me he wasn't available instead of ignoring my request. I didn't learn the old switch-a-roo had been pulled on me until my pedicure tech (Chris) was different and not good or thorough. He was barely ok. I should have listened to my fellow yelpers and passed on this establishment.
