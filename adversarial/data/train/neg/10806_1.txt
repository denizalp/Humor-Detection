We travel to Vegas often you can say and pass by the mesmerizing colorful sign all the time. I saw this Groupon deal for $25 towards $50 and it was well worth it that we used on 12\/14. We ordered the French dip sandwich with tater-tots (a lil extra for tots), Signature Burger with White Chocolate bun with fries and the Lollipop Passion Goblet. All was delicious but of course the Lollipop Passion Goblet stole the show. The waitress was awesome and helpful since it was our first time there. I wish i could remember her name. She asked me if I wanted to take pictures of her pouring this special liquid into the goblet even. As soon as she poured it, there was fogging, steaming and bubbling...so FUN! I even took the candy bracelet home to eat it while I gambled LOL! After the bill came, there was still a balance of $40, which was from th Goblet which was $36....yikes! She gave us some white chocolate covered nutty thingy that was soo sooo yummy. Also, Connected to the restaurant they have a very fun candy store! I found the stash of that same white choc covered yummy and bought some to go...oink oink!\n\nBuffets are always great but it's nice to try other dining options! I would definately recommend this on a girl's night out or even a date.
