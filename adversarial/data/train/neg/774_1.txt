1st of all security cannot handle the crowd. Food is wayyy over priced! Ordered a cheeseburger, cheese wasn't even melted. Ketchup was just red water? $12 for a watered down beer, $6 for spicy garlic fries! I felt like I was at mcdonalds? Worst of all, the registers wasn't working and couldn't take my credit card, all the sofa machines were pushing out watered down cola? I kinda just said whatever because I wanted to enjoy my night. But not without letting everyone know about my experiences! Lot of work to be done here for who ever is in charge.
