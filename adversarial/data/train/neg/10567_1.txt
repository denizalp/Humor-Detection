I took my Mom to lunch yesterday and I am glad we ate here.  The food was delicate, flavorful, and prepared and served beautifully.  We started out with a green papaya salad called Som Tum and curry chicken puffs.  The salad was delicious!  Tangy, savory, clean, refreshing, crisp, nutty, with a hint of heat.  The puffs...they are so good that we both could have eaten more.  We then had chicken panang and pad thai.  Both were scrumptious.  \n\nService was very good.  Refills before we had to ask, clean plates after our first courses, and they carried our leftovers to the back to package up for take away.  I would rate this place 4 1\/2 out of 5.  Definitely a great Thai restaurant.
