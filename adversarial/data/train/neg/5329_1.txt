Just ate at Juan's after a terrible experience at Barrio's (around the corner).  Boy am I glad Barrio's sucked because discovering Juan's was definitely the silver lining.\n\nGreat food, super cheap, and, even better, run by a very friendly family.  Had a great neighborhood feel to it (we were visiting Children's Hospital and don't live in the area).  Diverse lunchtime crowd including artists, firemen, and hospital staff and everyone seemed like they were regulars.\n\nJuan's is a gem.  We'll definitely be back whenever we have my nephew at Children's (which sadly, is all too often).
