Absolutely delicious! We went with a large group and they offer tasting menus - which would have been a good idea but we had a lot of different sushi favorites so we all ordered separately. \n\nI started with a tuna tataki appetizer that may have been the best I've ever had. The tuna was perfectly seasoned and seared. My mouth started drooling thinking about it. I wanted 10 more pieces. \n\nI then had a roll but I cannot for the life of me remember the name. It was slightly tempura but delicious. Great size as well. \n\nI went for a bachelorette weekend and they gave us two free cocktail towers which was extremely nice. \n\nOverall very great experience here. We stayed at the Venetian so the location also helped!
