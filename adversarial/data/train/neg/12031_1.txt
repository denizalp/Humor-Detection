For those with peanut allergies (and don't expect it to be in Japanese cuisine) beware: They use peanut butter in their vegetarian ramen option, and it is not mentioned anywhere in their description of it.\n\nIn fact, nowhere on the menu is it mentioned, nor is there any notice about food allergies in general. Had we not asked our server, I'd have gone straight to the hospital in anaphylaxis. \n\nOf course, I ask every time regardless - but the point is that (1) not everyone will, (2) it's mentioned zero times anywhere in the ingredients description\/menu, and (3) peanuts are traditionally not used in Japanese cuisine.\n\nI have no problem with \"fusion\" restaurants being creative, but for Christ's sake, mention the use of common food allergens please! Even something as simple as \"notify your waiter of any food allergies\" would suffice.\n\nThat said, the environment and mood of Morris Ramen is great. They did a nice job of capturing that cramped and stuffy \"ramen house vibe\" you often find in Japan. Their staff was also very friendly and welcoming. \n\nIt's too bad I won't be able to try their ramen!
