I was hoping to find a cozy breakfast place with good bacon, fair prices and a nice warm morning vibe.  Scramble is none of that.  Bright white and  chrome chairs with club  music it feels like a modern European youth place.  I find it annoying that you stand at the counter to give you order and pay ahead of time, where they put a big \"tip\" line on the receipt (for what?), reading off a glass covered 'menu', then get your own drink, table service, napkins & water.   Want ketchup?  Over there on the rack, with the salt & pepper, Tabasco, etc..   Kind of like eating at home, only more expensive.   Very modern \/ trendy, but very cold.  The young gals working there (can't really call them servers or waitresses) were polite and cute, but there will be all new ones next week, like most Scottsdale eateries.\n\nThe food was OK.  Not great, but OK.  Very average bread, cold hard little butter wrappies, white square plates to match the motif.  OJ, serve yourself, not fresh squeezed... watery.  \n\nKudos for having Fox News on the TVs!   \n\nCan't really give it more than an average rating and won't go back
