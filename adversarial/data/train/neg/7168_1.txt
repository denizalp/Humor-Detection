If I could give negative stars I would!  For a large mental health organization this is let down to individuals who suffer from mental health diseases. It took seven weeks to get an appointment and it was not at a location close to me. When I made the appointment I gave in detail my insurance information and also discussed what it would cost me if for some reason they did not take my insurance. I was given prices and ensured there would be no problem. I was emailed new patient paperwork to fill out. It was extensive, in excess of 10 pages. I had my former psychiatric group (which I was a patient of for greater than five years, they closed their offices in Phoenix )Send my entire patient history to Redemtion Psychiatric so that at my first appointment they would have a good detailed history of my care and of me as a patient. When I arrived for my highly anticipated appointment I was told that the could not accept my insurance. I then told them I would pay cash, which I was told they DO NOT DO THAT I WOULD BE A LIABILITY. So, after seven weeks the liability left the office  without any idea as to how to get psychiatric care. This is irresponsible to say the least. In this day and age when mentally ill persons are having a hard enough time fighting stigma and every thing else involved with mental health disorders, to screw up this badly is enough to push and individual over the edge. I am fortunate enough to have a good therapist and family doctor who will make sure I am taken care of until I find a psychiatrist to monitor my medication. But, not everyone is as fortunate as I am. Big thumbs down and reporting them to any and all boards applicable to this grave oversight.
