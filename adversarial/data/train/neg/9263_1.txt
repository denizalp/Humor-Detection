The boys were really hungry one Sunday afternoon, so we stopped here for brunch.  Our server was friendly and attentive, so our water and orange juice (from concentrate) glasses were never empty.  Alas, the food at the buffet was hit and miss.  \n\nHits: --the fried chicken tenders with sweet chilli sauce was a delicious combination of salty and sweet with a mild kick of chilli heat.  \n--I love perfectly fried, crispy bacon (I dislike the microwave kind) and the waffles(with syrup) were a good match.  \n--the chef at the beef and ham carving station was very pleasant to me; I managed to persuade him to serve me a medium piece of roast beef (there were no more medium rare pieces left).  The beef was still quite tender, though.\n\nMisses: --all three bowls of salad greens weren't replenished for the entire time that we were there; and a quarter of the greens weren't very fresh (limp with dark spots).  \n--the eggs on the Eggs Benedict were a bit too hard poached for my boys' taste.  \n--the barbecue ribs were tough, chewy (not falling off the bone, that's for sure) and bland.\n--the same chef at the carving station treated my son in a gruff manner(unfortunately, I wasn't there when this happened) and served him (at the pasta station) cold pasta and cold tomato sauce (the sauce had a vinegary, unfinished taste).  Gee, all you had to do was warm it up in a pan.\n--dessert was a huge disappointment.  There were some kind of squares\/pudding served in a rectangular pyrex dish that turned out to be a sloppy mess after the diners had been digging in and out of it with a spoon (it reminded me of something my grandmother would make).  The \"classic cheesecake\" looked and tasted like it had been bought from Superstore.  I thought they would serve a miniature version of their famous cheesecakes...
