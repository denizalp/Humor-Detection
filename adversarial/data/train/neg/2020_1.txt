Had a wonderful two night stay here. The amenities are great! We stayed during the week and had the pool to ourselves 90% of the time. There's hammocks, ping pong, foosball, a fitness center, tennis courts, etc all for free use on the property. The rooms are spacious and very clean. \n\nMy only complaint while staying here was that the house keeping service knocked on our door twice within an hour even with the 'Do Not Disturb' sign on the door. The second of which the woman came in to clean even after we politely said we did not need their services for the day. My friend who was laying on the bed was shooed off by the cleaning woman.
