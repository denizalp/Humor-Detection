I love panda express, but quite frankly the last few times that i've eaten at this one in the Venetian I've gotten sick! i thought the first 4 times was just a mere coinsidence but then the 5th and 6th?? i'm fine eating at every other panda express but not this one. And I always get the same thing! I'm guessing it may not be the most sanitary panda express! Idk, all i know is i can't eat at this one anymore bc it literally makes me sick! which sucks! its so convenient bc I work in the Palazzo! Waaaa!
