What we ate:\n\n- Kebbeh \n- Musaaka \n- Tabbouleh  \n- Mixed Grill\n- Moutabbal \n\nFood was solid and service was extremely fast. The Tabbouleh was especially good - it was crisp without being too crunchy and had the perfect amount of acidity (definitely not overly oily at all). Very fresh. \n\nThe mixed grill was satisfying. The kebbeh was the only below average thing we ate. The filling was a bit dry and didn't work well with the crispy outside. A bit too oily but still did the trick. Moutabbal was fantastic.
