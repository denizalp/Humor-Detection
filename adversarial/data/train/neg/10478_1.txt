last thing the management cares about are the locals...spent 45 minutes at the fishing counter trying to get a fishing reel to complete a fishing rod and reel for a young boy who lost his dad in Afghanistan, as I wanted to give it to him for his birthday as well as take him fishing...well NO ONE was interested enough in helping me...so I gave up on the fishing dept...I Javier, guess the Department Manager isn't customer oriented...so I go up to the firearm area and see some ammo being stocked, as it turns out it was reloading supplies and I was low on primers and I see 6 boxes of 1000 each on the cart, so I go to reach for a box and I'm told they are not for sale, they are for the guys in the back...I wonder when Bass Pro started reloading ammo in the back room...this store manager just DOES NOT WANT LOCAL CUSTOMERS...so I leave empty handed....go home get on line and find the reel online for less than half what Bass pro wanted for it and it was free shipping and no tax\n\nI found out I can certainly DO WITH OUT a Bass Pro in Las Vegas\nespecially one that lives to sucker in the hapless and unaware tourists
