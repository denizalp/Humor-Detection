I was expecting average Mexican but was blown away. This is taco shop prices with foodie approval worthy combos. The brussel sprout nachos were a surprising burst of flavor with the pickled onion and egg on top. I will be dreaming about them for days.\n\nOur table tried each of the tacos and were pleased with the flavor and tenderness of the meat. The chicken tortilla soup didn't disappoint the heaping serving had large chunks of chicken and freshly cubed avocado. My husband the finicky eater ordered the Sonoran Hot Dog. It was high beef hot dog wrapped in Texas toast and he loved every bite of it. The mango habanero wings were also a win.\n\nSave your money and don't get the beans and rice they were lack luster and a bit bland. Our only complaint was our server was a bit slow on drinks and we had to keep getting up to order more. As a tequila snob I was pleased with the house margarita but wanted a kick so the bartender added fresh jalape√±os. \n\nI hope to make it back when we come to town for their happy hour. This place is great!
