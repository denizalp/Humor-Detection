My 2 yr old face planted my ipad mini the screen was cracked everywhere. I went into One Stop Wireless to see if there was hope in replacing the screen without breaking the bank.....OMG from the moment I walked in it was Professional all the way. They were up front, honest, and affordable......when I picked up my device 3 hrs later, it was as if it never was cracked....I will def refer them to anyone.....and you can just sense their dedication to their customers.
