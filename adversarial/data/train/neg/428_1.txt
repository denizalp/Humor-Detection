With 500+ Reviews, Most of all it has been said but I will offer this:\nFox Concepts Restaurants consistently pulls off a memorable, pleasant experience that is tasty, full of quality and will, occasionally, have a memorable service experience.  \nAll restaurants have their ups & downs, but Olive & Ivy is consistently good, innovative and the atmosphere is quite nice; inside or outside.\nDrinks are tasty, Scallopini and Cannelloni are both just Yum!  Never had a bad experience here.\n\nOverall Rating: 4.5 Stars\nService: 4.1 Stars\nFood: 4.6 Stars \nQuality: 4.5 Stars\nCleanliness: 4.2 Stars\nValue: 3.9 Stars
