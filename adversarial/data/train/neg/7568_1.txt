Best gun store in Vegas. I live a good 30 minutes from Spartan Arms and I pass a couple other gun shops on my way there but this store is a bit different than the others in ways that make the drive worth it. The guys behind the counter are friendly, knowledgeable, and eager to help out without being pushy. I think the general attitude in this shop is what really sets it apart. This is the kind of place you can stop by just to hang out and chat for a bit while some other gun shops in Vegas have more of a \"buy something or get out\" kind of attitude.
