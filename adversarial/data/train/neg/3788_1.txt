I came with some friends from out of town  on a Wednesday and had an awesome time. The manager Sean was so hospitable and made the place feel like a business run by friends. The staff were all polite and ready to help you with whatever. What really made the night were the comedians. The host Lawrence and everyone else put on a great show with a great atmosphere.
