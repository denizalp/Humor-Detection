I was staying at the Palazzo and saw that the Wynn was just a hop, skip, and a jump away, so we all decided to go over there for lunch.  The service was terrible, and I swear it took 45 minutes to an hour to get our food.  We didn't order anything fancy, a couple burgers and a chicken sandwich.  I noticed that it seemed like everyone around us was waiting around for food.  I don't understand what took so long.  Did they have to go find the cow, and make my burger?  The place looked nice, but I hardly ever saw our server, and it was way too slow.  The only reason I gave it two stars instead of one was because the food was pretty good once we got it, but it's not worth it if the service is terrible.
