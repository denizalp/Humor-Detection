The worst things about American-Asian restaurants are the food tastes old and the flavors are all the same. However, our food at Golden Palace had neither of these qualities.\n\nBasil chicken hot pot was the best. Really fresh veggies and unique flavors. The meat to vegetable ratio was perfect. \n\nMy sushi rolls were really good. I liked how the California roll had separate crab, avocado & cucumber (not mixed up like a crab salad which many restaurants do). My miso soup was a huge portion for only $2.\n\nAnother cool thing is the Thai menu, which is pretty rare for a Chinese\/Japanese restaurant. Definitely going to return soon to try the curry. The only negative of this restaurant was the atmosphere, consisting of bare walls and one TV.
