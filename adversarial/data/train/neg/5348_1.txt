I was very disappointed with the service my daughter received. First the beautician who was scheduled to do my daughter hair was 38 min late. Our appointment was 9am on a Saturday, once she arrived she never apologized for being late. Second I showed a pic of the double twist I wanted for my daughter from their very own website and my daughter came back with a style that I hated. Nothing what I asked for. The only reason why I didn't tell her how much I hated the style she just did was my child was there and didn't want to make a scene. Never will I come back here!!!!!!!\n\nI was very disappointed with the service my daughter received. First the beautician who was scheduled to do my daughter hair was 38 min late.
