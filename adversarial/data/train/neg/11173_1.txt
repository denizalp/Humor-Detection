We did not have a good experience here. The food was mediocre at best which actually isn't the reason why I am giving this place a poor review. We have eaten at tons of buffets and the food in general tends to be just so so (with some exceptions). Some dishes are fairly decent but most just alright. What this buffet truly does more poorly than any other here in Vegas is service. We were a large party (16) and of course had to pay 18% gratuity upfront. Ok, fine. Many of the people in our group work in the service industry in restaurants so we expected the upfront tipping. We have been paying this upfront 18% all weekend and have had really great service at the restaurants we have been to. However, our \"server\", who got tipped over 100 dollars, informed us that if we want the beer, coffee, sodas, or bloody Marys that came with the meal, we had to go and get them ourselves. The bartender where you got the bloody Marys was extremely snippy making it unpleasant to go up and get a drink. Our server couldn't be anywhere to be found. We had to wait and wait (many of us waiting over 20 minutes) to get champagne (which was one of the few  things our server could actually serve us) and she rarely cleared the dirty plates. Our plates sat and sat in front of us. So she got 100 dollars but didn't have to bring food or most beverages to the table and didn't clear the dishes until we had a couple piled in front of each of us. A member in our group finally went to find her and spoke to her and she made slightly more effort but it was, all in all, a pretty bad experience. I highly suggest to spend a little more and go to the Belaggio or the Wynn where both the food and the service is so much better than here. Paying a server that much money for basically clearing a few plates is ridiculous.
