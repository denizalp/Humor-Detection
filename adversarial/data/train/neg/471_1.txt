I came here for lunch with a small group several weeks ago. I loved it! It's a good location, easy to get to, and easy to find if you look for the sign. Great decor, although a little dark even at lunchtime. We were greeted by the manager (we made a group reservation to be on the safe side), seated promptly, and offered beaded necklaces for Mardi Gras.\n\nWe ordered the PEI mussels for our appetizer, just to try (there's a coupon on their website for a free appetizer!), and they were pretty good. Nothing spectacular, but the white wine garlic sauce was fantastic. As my main course, I ordered the shrimp & chicken étouffée, which would have been my usual choice, but was SUCH a great decision. Amazing meal; perfectly spiced and proportioned. I would recommend it to anyone coming here. Also tried a few bites of the seafood fettucine, which was very good as well.\n\nI didn't get our waitress' name, but she was lovely; patient, attentive, and very friendly. She was an expert on the bourbon selection! Great service, great atmosphere. Appetizers are a little pricey considering portion sizes, but the online coupon helps.
