I'm a very tough critic when it comes to Mexican food, especially tacos. I've eaten alot of them in Toronto, Mexico, and alot of places inbetween. This place has very good authentic  proper Mexican tacos. Lots of varieties to choose from, I tried them all, all were great. No complaints. 5star food, service, easy parking, overall experience. Can't wait to go back, maybe tomorrow.
