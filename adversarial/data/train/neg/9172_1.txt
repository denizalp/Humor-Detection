I had high hopes for this place given that its Yelp rating is tops and that it was plugged by Pop City Media's 2012 \"Two guys. 12 pizzas. One day.\" feature, even despite being towards the end of the 12-pizza day.\n\nI got a small sausage and mushroom pizza.  Didn't like the toppings at all.  The mushrooms had a very strange and off-putting texture and color.  I suspect they were slice canned mushrooms, because I've had lots of fresh mushroom pizzas and they have NEVER looked or tasted like that before.  Bad start.\n\nThe flavor of the sausage was totally carried by salt... it tasted like salt and sausage-texture.\n\nBut -- otherwise, the sauce and flavor were pretty good, and the crust not bad.  It's chewy, though, not really my favorite style.  I think I could have enjoyed the pizza if I didn't get the particular toppings I chose.\n\nI'd maybe get pizza here again if I had to feed a crowd or if I were drunk, but I'll stick to cheese or pepperoni next time.  To be fair, it is pretty good bang for your buck (the small pizza is substantial and around $8 with two toppings!)
