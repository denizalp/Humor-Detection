The BEST place to bring your Goldendoodle (or any pup)!! Selene has been grooming my doodle for 5 years & he always comes out PERFECT! We moved to Denver a yr ago & I brought him back for a groom, Marilyn and Selene didn't miss a beat! Remembered his exact cut (inches) & style (teddy bear). Plus Easton clearly missed them. Their attention to detail is impeccable! Their ridiculously clean new shop is amazing! You are missing out if your not getting your dog groomed here.
