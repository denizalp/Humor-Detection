1000+ people reviewed it for such a small place... thats so cool.\n\nTheir Brisket, Ribs, Sausage and Jalapeno Grits are simply awesome. I like their Lean Brisket over the fatty Brisket & yesterday u can't go wrong with the Jefe Sandwich - Sausage with Brisket or Pork is freaking delicious.\n\nThey have 3 bbq sauces which are crazy with flavor. Hands down this is the best beef brisket which i ever had and i really think my move from FL to AZ is worth because of LMB :))).\n\nPlease do try this place this place is beyond Delicious and they make the food here with passion and love :) and be prepared for the wait time because of the huge line but it is totally totally worth it.
