My husband and I stopped here during our road trip to Cleveland and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.  I love burgers and after learning LeBron likes this place we thought we should give it a try.  We were not disappointed!  Great service.  Great food and reasonable prices.  I had the Galley Boy, onion rings and a chocolate shake.  It was all yummy including the nicely grilled burger bun.  Try it!
