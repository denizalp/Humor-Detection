Friend took me here, due to the fact that I just graduated college, and got a job, in my degree\/field. so a free lunch is great either way. lol I want to comment on the ambiance first. Being that it was in summerlin, it was a little upscale. but it was a very a open setting. servers seem relaxed, for a busy saturday lunch. I always like to watch the servers, body language tells alot if they really like their job or not. made feel relaxed\/welcoming throughout the whole dining experience. friend had the biloxi buttermilk fried chicken sandwich. had the power lunch combo. she loved the sandwich, and it came with soup which she didn't like, server gladly switched it for salad. who can mess up salad right?? salad was nothing special, mixed garden greens. I had the big eye tuna. a, with wasabi pea & ginger crust came with salad, a baby spinach, asian pears, sea beans, in a  creamy soy vinaigrette. Great flavor all around. don't eat too much seafood but tuna definitely made ma fan. would go back. only complaint, was soup obviously, and maybe 2 or 3 more slices of tuna. but everything as far as quality of food and service was great.
