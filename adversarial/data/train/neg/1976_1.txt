This place would have got a 5 star rating from me.  I loved the dermatologist who helped resolve he skin problems my dog was facing from one visit.  The consultation fee is double of a regular veterinary consultation fee which is fine considering it is a specialist.  My problem is the fact that on my follow up appointment, I was charged a re-check fee which is half he cost of the consultation fee.   This came as a shock to me and I was not advised hat there was a cost for the follow up appointment.   No veterinary charges for a follow up appointments so I was surprised that for a simple follow up which only lasted 10 minutes, I was charged $100.  This is ridiculous.
