Extremely underwhelmed. We're visiting from out of town and I forgot to pick up my prescription before leaving. Called this pharmacy almost 2 hours before we arrived asking them to transfer it from our home town pharmacy. They said no problem, took all of the information down, and said they'd call us if there was a problem. Get to the pharmacy (almost 2 HOURS later) and go to the counter expecting it to be ready. \"Who did you talk to when you called\" they ask me. We didn't remember but then they found the note about it and said \"oh we have the note about it but weren't able to get ahold of them earlier\". Ummm okay it's Rite Aid, a major pharmacy, never once have they not answered when I called and plus Walgreens said they'd call if there was a problem. We didn't get a call. No apology was offered. We were told it would be 10 minutes until it was ready. 30 minutes later I get the prescription, still no apology.
