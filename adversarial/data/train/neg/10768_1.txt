In-n-Out alone is a reason for me not to move back to the east coast. The food is the same each time I've gone. Delicious. I've gone probably six times since I've moved here. This is just a step up from anything I've experienced in Orlando, FL, another hot spot for high expectations in customer service. The only negative is sometimes have to wait a bit for food as the place is so packed. But I suppose that is something to expect if people keep coming back.
