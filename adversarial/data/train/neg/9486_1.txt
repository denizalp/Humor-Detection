My Mom and I waited 45 minutes in the drive through line. When I called from my cell phone to complain to the manager the lady claimed to be the manager then when I asked for her name she claimed she was not the manager and would not give her name. Then I heard all of the employees arguing in the background and I hung up. RIDICULOUS!! If I were the owner I would be absolutely ASHAMED!
