I'm not nearly as impressed with Hacienda as I am with Playa Cabana down the street. True, the decor at Hacienda is super cool, with its giant illuminated signs reading BAR and LIQUOR, and its collection of pulley hook things at the front entrance.\n\nBut the tables are crammed together wayyy too tight. We sat elbow to elbow with couples on either side of us, and it was nearly impossible not to eavesdrop anytime we paused to take a bite. Awkward seating arrangement, for sure. (There were plenty of open tables in the restaurant....why did they have to seat people on either side of us, literally inches away?) Also, I found it too brightly lit in there, which further detracted from the ambiance.\n\nBut really, it was the food that left me most disappointed. We ordered a trio of grilled fish tacos, which we've always thoroughly enjoyed at Playa Cabana. At Hacienda--not so much. They just weren't good at all.\n\nThe sangria, so skilfully concocted at Playa Cabana, also fell short here.\n\nThe saving grace was the beef shortrib taco, which thankfully has the same magic formula we fell in love with at Playa Cabana. If you do come to Hacienda, order the shortrib taco or miss out on a divine mess of savoury, crunchy goodness.
