I'm a believer. Until now, I have mostly found ramen to be noodles in broth. But this is for real. We both had the Morris Ramen and it was absolutely delicious to the last drop of broth. Cocktails and great local beers on tap. Cozy and quick service. I wish this place was in Minnesota! I'd be a regular!
