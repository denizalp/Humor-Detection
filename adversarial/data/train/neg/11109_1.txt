Not the best.  Baked goods are awesome.  Soups are OK  but not overly flavorful\nvery disappointed in how this place is sliding.  pricing keeps going up and quality down.  I just paid $10 for a turkey sandwich that was missing half of the ingredients described on the menu.\nCashiers cant make change and they just hand you your stuff without even asking if you need a bag.  I got soup and sandwich handed to me.  Soup was dripped all over the container.  I asked for a bag and got an eye roll and a bag popped and handed to me like I had a disease.\ndon't waste your money
