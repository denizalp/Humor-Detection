It's a horrible feeling to discover signs of termites in your house, but I would highly recommend House Doctor Exterminating, as Dave Ramos is extremely knowledgeable as well as personable, and he was able to put all my fears to rest. He went out of his way to schedule me into his busy schedule for an inspection within a day of my calling the company. I was impressed with his professionalism throughout the inspection. At the end of our meeting, he said he would email me a treatment plan as well as warranty information, and what do you know... the promised email came from him that same evening! The actual treatment was scheduled for the beginning of the next week, but Mother Nature intervened, and monsoon flooding impacted the crew that was going to treat my house. Dave bent over backwards to contact me (phone messages and email) and reschedule another crew to service my house as soon as they finished a big job in the same part of town, with the caveat that if they might not be able to finish my house by the end of the day and would have to come back. That was fine with me, but to my amazement, the crew showed up by 1pm and finished my house by 5. The crew was conscientious, professional, thorough, and extremely hard-working! The quality of their work was excellent. I have inherited another property that has signs of termites, and  I will be calling House Doctor Exterminating again!
