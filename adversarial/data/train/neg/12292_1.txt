I've been going to Dr. Weingartens office for a few months now. He did my ear & nose surgery he is awesome! The staff is nice too which you don't see very often. I would definitely recommend this office. I have read the other reviews and I can tell you that not every doctor's personality fits with yours but I do feel that weingarten does a great job! I like his personality and the assistant in the back I don't know her name, she's pretty cool.  Oh yea and the decor is super cool compared to drab and boring doctors offices.
