We hired Tableside Gourmet to cater a party of 16 in our home.  From the first contact we had with Ken in emailing to request a quote until the last dish was packed up and put away, the service was professional, timely and friendly.  We selected a number of items from the Mexican menu and every dish was wonderful.  Without exception, every single one of our guests commented on the quality and deliciousness of the food as well as the exceptional service.  In addition, the servers kept a close eye on the guests and made sure their wine and margarita glasses were not empty for more than a minute.  All of the staff checked in with my husband and i at regular intervals to inquire if everything was going well and if we needed anything. It was a wonderful stress-free evening.  We highly recommend Tableside Gourmet and will be using them again as catering needs arise.
