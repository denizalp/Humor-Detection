It was delicious and the service was great! My boyfriend and I started with the shrimp and pork spring rolls which had an amazing peanut dipping sauce. We also had crispy shrimp egg rolls which were very tasty as well. We ordered one of the specials which was the shaken beef with shrimp and garlic noodles. The seasoning was tasty and the meat was cooked perfectly, so was the shrimp. Everything was delicious. We will be coming back again.
