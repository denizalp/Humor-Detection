I've lived in a few other cities and Las Vegas has the strangest Post Office options of any of them, and the actual locations are few and always have long lines, so Goin Postal is an excellent alternative.  As everyone else has commented, the staff\/owners are super nice and helpful.  I definitely recommend going here for your shipping needs!
