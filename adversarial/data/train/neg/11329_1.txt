I want to give  3.5 stars here.... food isn't bad at all for dim sum, and there aren't very many places that are off the strip that is good around here. This place has been renovated and much cleaner now and dim sum are tasty. Been here several times now and everything we've order were all HOT and tasty. Doesn't lack any flavors. Services is not too bad, but every now and then you'll need to get up to get someones attention and or retrieve food yourself. If you don't see what you're looking for in the carts please be sure to just order it and they will bring to you when its done.\n\nThis place is great for large parties as well, as they do have large tables near the back of the restaurant. \n\nCheck it if you're looking for something away from the strip and prices are reasonable.
