For 24 dollars I would expect better quality of food. Potatoes au gratin were made from a box. Steak was very dry and tough and chewy. Scrambled eggs were watery. I didn't even finish a plate of food. The only reason I'm giving it two stars was because the dessert bar was good. Wide selection of cakes, and mousses and creme brulee. Otherwise don't waste your money.
