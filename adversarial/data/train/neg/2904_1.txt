If you can get a table, it rocks. For a relatively small fee, you can play any of their MANY games for pretty much as long as you like. Very accommodating, neat atmosphere. Fairly noisy, but it's to be expected. Some of their more popular games are a little worn and some pieces might be missing (such as in Pandemic), but it's obvious that they really try to take care of their games. There were some kids, but thankfully their parents kept them under control.\n\nThe servers are all very helpful and passionate, and will even explain the games to you if you ask. My one issue is the food. WAY overpriced. Sandwiches for $15 that are nowhere near worth that much. Coffee and tea is reasonable, and I understand that they don't make enough from people just sitting and playing, but it's still not pleasant.\nReally good place though if you're looking to kill an afternoon with some friends. Great selection of games to buy in the front, as well.
