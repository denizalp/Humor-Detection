This was my husband and I first time at this restaurant. I had heard so much about this place. We went on a Saturday night and they had a live band.  I had the salmon and grits and my husband had the shrimp and grits. The food was great! I only gave it 4 stars because the band was so loud in such a small space that we couldn't really have a conversation. We will go back during the week and hopefully it won't be so loud.
