I popped into Einstein Bros today to pick up an everything bagel with schmear. I was greeted with a polite good morning by an employee cleaning the dining room, and Andrew ( who took my order) made my day by joking with me and being very friendly. My bagel was ready in less than a minute and tasted so delicious!! My only complaint is that adding schmear is more than the cost of the bagel.
