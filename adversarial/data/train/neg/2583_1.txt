Do you like customer service?  Do you like chit chatting with the staff to figure out what sounds good?  This place is not for you.\n\nThe food is straight up goodness. Combo platters are the way to go, however I've never been pleased with the pork egg rolls as its just cabbage inside no pork. \n\nKung Pao, Mongollian, etc is all super good. Just be prepared for the total lack of disrespect when it comes to being acknowledged as a customer. \n\nOne more thing, if you order to go you gotta grab your own sauces...which is totally fine just don't forget!  Oh and I wish they made their own spicy mustard. The Panda packets they give out taste like they've been there for decades.
