Always check your food for a Togo order before leaving this location. I am a vegan and I specified that I wanted a vegan style veggie burger but my food was not prepared correctly.  They gave me the wrong side dish and didn't have my drink prepared. I would think twice before ordering here again. Im giving two stars because of their kind service.
