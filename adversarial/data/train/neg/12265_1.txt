Russel is a funny guy. Very warm and welcoming, and makes you feel like you're at his house attending a family party! He's from the Big Island, so it's not surprising! I love that this place is a hole-in-the-wall also. \n\nThe food here is great! Not the top of my list, but definitely worth a visit every time I'm on\/near Sahara! I usually get the BBQ Combo, because it comes with a LOAD of stuff, and the Stone Pot (Dolsot) Bibimbap is worth mentioning too. I also like that boiled peanuts and side dishes are served almost immediately after taking a seat.\n\nThey also have a booth in Greenland Supermarket! I haven't made my way to that one just yet, but i'm sure they've still got it goin' on!
