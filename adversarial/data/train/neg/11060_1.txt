Jennifer is amazing ! Such a great server and is really funny ! She was personable and absolutely made it an easy experience dining here ! I would ask for her every time ! The bread is obviously a staple for piece and rightfully so, we went through two bowls of it ! Our food was delicious and so were the drinks! Both of our sirloins were cooked exactly how we wanted them! I love the service and the atmosphere!
