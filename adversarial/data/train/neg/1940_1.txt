I have eyed this place since a month before it opened. I finally got to experience it for the first time, what, 2, 3, years later?\nIt was worth the wait from the taste but I do wish I had come sooner.\nTheir top ramen was delicious and the Brussels sprouts were incredible. You must try the Brussels sprouts.\nMy only wish is that they would open a second location or move to a bigger one. I crave broth based items when it is cold, but waiting  outside 45 minutes for a seat because there is so little space just isn't happening. Good thing I just learned they do takeout!
