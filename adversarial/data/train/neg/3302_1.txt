I am so thrilled that we followed our gut feeling about Thunderbird and went with them for our pool.  We are currently in the finishing stages of the pool building process.   We actually should be filling it later today.  \nOur experience has been beyond exceptional.   The office crew, Nicole, Lisa, Kelly, Cynthia and Janet have all gone above and beyond during all the stages of the process.  I loved how each person had their own specialty for the building process.  They all made sure I was kept informed about what was coming up next.   They all seemed to be passionate about their job and it wasn't just a job for them.  \nThe on-site work crews were always professional.  There were so many different people in and out of the yard and they were fantastic.  Joe, the construction superintendent, was perfect in his position.   He kept everything going smoothly.  \nI couldn't be happier with Thunderbird.  Many thanks to all of you for having a company that makes you feel like family.
