I must say the ambiance of this establishment invites you. Very unique. With that being said I have to say the food is VERY bland! If you are a lover of bold\/popping flavors- this is not your place. My fiance' and I have visited Fern on several occasions. Initially, a few years ago we came for breakfast, this was when they offered the green grits (which are no longer available). We've ordered their version of \"chicken n waffles\"; bland! The mock chicken was not seasoned properly. On another occasion we brought our parents and we all ordered their version of mac n cheese, with bbq ribs, and greens- NO! Again, very bland. We've tried to give them chance after chance but we will not be dining there again. With us being vegan, when visiting from out of town we didn't have a choice but we can no longer waste our money. If you are a lover of flavor, this would not be the ideal restaurant for you.
