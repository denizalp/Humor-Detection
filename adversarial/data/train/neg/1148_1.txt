Had an ok experience here. Not one of my first picks for AYCE BBQ. Prices were average for a KBBQ spot. They did have a lot of different appetizers that other places don't have like the rice cake. The meat was nothing special to me I've had better brisket and pork belly and ribs. And the major turn off for me was that they place all ur meat orders at the table right away. So if u order a lot of meat items it'll be just sitting there till ur grill opens up. Probably won't be back.
