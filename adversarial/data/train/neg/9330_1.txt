Our first time at the sugar factory at townsquare, and it was very good. Our server Nissa was attentive. She recommended drinks suiting our best interests and also brought our friend birthday shots. The food was great and big pirtioned, also, the drinks are delicious. Nissa described the entire drink menu for us to ensure we ordered our favorite one. Seriously try this place out!
