Came in to see a PA, She was fine. Peggy at the front desk however has grown quite unpleasant. I came in 20 minutes before my appointment and asked if I could switch times with my daughter, who was 15 before me but still on the way. She said, \"No, there will be no switching. If she is not here within 10 after her appointment time, we will cancel her.\" She was 12 and they cancelled her. The time element would have been the same so I felt it was uncalled for.  It ended up that I still waited beyond my time, so I saw this as a way for them to catch up at our expense. An elderly lady that was there before me was still waiting when I came back out. Poor dear! I felt badly for her. It is fine to send someone home sick that comes in 2 minutes outside the time window, but let's keep a 90 year old waiting with sick people coming in and out, exposing her to heaven knows what. If you don't care, don't do patient care! Such apathy!\nI also had another time when I had a diagnostic mammogram to be ordered. I called back for 3 months before the Radiology Center finally  received it. I ended up needing surgery! So slack!
