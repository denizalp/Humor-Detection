Charlotte's got a lot of great pizza places, but for my money, Libretto's is near the top. The pizza's about as authentic, NY-style as it gets, the pasta dishes are wonderful, and the garlic knots out of this world. Kid-friendly atmosphere and a convenient Ballantyne location make Libretto's a must.
