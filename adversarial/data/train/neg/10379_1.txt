I live near the Queen St location and just discovered the location downtown. Same amazing recipes with a nicer interior and faster service. Order to stay and they serve to your table on cool Lazy Susan plates.\n\nA combo will set you back $12, which is well worth it compared to other expensive downtown fare.
