Good dependable BBQ. This place is NOT knock your socks off, write home about it BBQ. But, it IS good. The ribs, pulled pork, and brisket are all very good. I've had all and liked all. It is VERY reasonably priced. Last time we got food from here it was to feed my buddies helping me build my deck. Every one dug in and complimented it. I'm so glad it's so close to the house.
