First off I have to give a big shout out to reformatt.com for his youtube video review of best places to hang out in Toronto.  That's how I found out about Dime. Reformatt was right on point. Dime is real people, great vibes. Food is \"hit the spot\" goodness. Drinks are strong. Very laid back environment and the staff was the perfect balance of super cool and uber professional. Don't let the underground wrappings fool you. They are serious about business and customer service here.  This was my first time visiting Toronto since 1992 as a college ringer in my old high school symphonic band.  The next time I visit Toronto, Dime will be my base camp. $5 everything good eats!!!! WTF!!!! Any other highfalutin place might call them tapas and charge you as if it were an entree. I had the breakfast sandwich...perfect; fried cauliflower.... perfect; and the shrimp taco....perfect.  Oh.... and the playlist. HIp hop, House, r&b....beatz.
