We recently moved to the area and I asked around to many moms and they all recommended Mesa Peds. I have had some poor experiences elsewhere so I was really picky when finding an office in Arizona. My must-haves in a pediatrician and their office are being able to get ahold of a doctor in the evenings or after hours promptly, ease of making appointments and availability for same-day visits, knowledgeable office team, and kind and gentle nurses to care for my young babies. \n\nWhat I've experienced is an office staff who is extremely knowledgeable, quick and efficient. When making appointments (including same-day) because of their large team it is really easy to get in and see a provider. \n\nMy kids have picked up every bug (it seems) and we have been in a lot unfortunately! But each team member we have seen has been on the same page and knowledgeable. \n\nI love the sick and well entrances that give some space and separation. The office is clean and organized. I don't prefer bringing my kids to a doctor when there are so many bugs going around so when they are well I like the separation of space for sick and well visits. \n\nI have seen three different doctors and a handful of nurses over my visits and they all give time and concern helping me with any questions I bring to the table. Not making me feel rushed at all. \n\nI'm most appreciative of feeling like my concerns are heard and met with a team who is caring, knowledgeable and prompt. I'd highly recommend them to anyone within their areas of service. \n\nBonus, the Tempe office has a playground fish tank and plays movies in the waiting area! What a great way to keep kids happy during visits.
