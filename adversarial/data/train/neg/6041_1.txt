Refused to put my choice of oil in my own car! Tried upselling me from my choice of synthetic blend ($20 with my coupon) to full synthetic ($50 and I had no coupon). They tried telling me my car NEEDED the expensive oil (I got the car from my dad, who's an engineer with this particular car's manufacturer). I still refused and just wanted to use my coupon. Then they tried to get me to sign and said, \"okay, it'll be $20 if your car takes that oil\" and they handed me a pen and work order. I asked, so will I know the price before you start work? They said, well if it's not supposed to take that oil, then it'll be $50. Nice try. They were actually going to try to trick \/ force me to pay an extra $30. So I asked if they were refusing to put my choice of oil in the car, and they said yes.  What a waste of time. Every time I come here it's a hassle. Never again.\n\nUPDATE. As I went to a jiffy lube to get my oil change I got a call. The manager called me and was very nice and confirmed that my car could take synthetic blends, and he apologized. I've never been contacted by a manager after I left a business, especially when I didn't buy anything. That was impressive. I also asked how he got my name and phone, since I never identified myself to the clerk. He said he got it from my plate (I'd gotten service there before). I appreciate the research he did to find me, calling me, and being so polite. Changing from 1-4 stars.
