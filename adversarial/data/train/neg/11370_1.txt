I've been coming for lunch here for the past 5-6 years. The food is good (tho the general Tao chicken doesn't taste as good as it once did). The service is usually quick at lunch. We order a few dishes to share and they generally start coming out after about 5-10 minutes from ordering. Great if you're in a hurry during lunch. Lunch specials come with a hot drink.
