We went here for the first time today because we wanted to try the chicken liver and guizzards.  The liver was very dry and the gizzards were so tough we couldn't even bite thru them. We had to throw them away.  The cup of gravy that was served with them looked like wall paper paste and i would bet wall paper paste would have more taste.  We will not waste our time and money to go back.
