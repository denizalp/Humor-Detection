Line Upon Line Montessori is the very best! Miss Sheri and Nikki are both such patient and knowledgeable teachers. They provide a perfect balance of independent work, 1 on 1 lessons, and group activities. My daughter has grown so much in the past year with them, and I can't wait to see what she will learn in her 2nd year at Line Upon Line! 10\/10 would recommend to anyone.
