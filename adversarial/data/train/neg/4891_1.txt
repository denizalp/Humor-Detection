went there because we were drawn in by how good the menu sounded. Food was terrible. Worst food I've had In Vegas. Was excited to try the duck wings as I've had them other places before. The sauce was overpowering and you couldn't taste the actual wings. I ordered the Cleveland hot brown which was a pile of soggy meat covered in cheese. I don't know what the flavor was supposed to be but it was not to my taste. The garlic fries on the side tasted like eating a pure garlic clove. Gave this place 2 stars because the service was quick and our server felt bad I didn't like my food so she took it off the bill.
