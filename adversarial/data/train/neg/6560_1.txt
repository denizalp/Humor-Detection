I LOVE this QT. They have so many products that I like to buy.\nThe manager is so customer service oriented, and keeps encouraging his employees.\nI did have an issue the last time I was there though, most of the ice at the soda fountain wasn't working, as well as a number of drinks that I like were out of service.\nThe checkout staff, however, is superb..\nI like the large amount of space given for the gas bar area...easy to maneuver in and out of.\nThe location is also very easily accessible.. My GPS just messes it up for me each time!!\nAll in all I recommend....but QT, please keep your soda fountain in working order!!
