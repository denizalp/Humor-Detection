Absolutely terrible.  I was walking my dog Saturday afternoon and the On Trac truck was racing through our gate-guarded community at breakneck speed with the radio was BLARING at full volume...unbelievably unprofessional.  But the slob of a driver pulled up to a rolling stop near me and I said \"Why don't you turn down the music?\"...to which he flipped me off and sped away.  Other reviewers are right, zero is the correct rating for this company.  I don't know how they stay in business.  Based on the other reviews, this company (and I use that term loosely) doesn't give a damn about customers, packages, or safety.
