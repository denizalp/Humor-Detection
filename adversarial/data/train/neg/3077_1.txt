Sebastian at Mose's is one of the nicest people I've ever met. He's truly an expert in his field. I trust him with all my leather items. He's cleaned many leather items for me including wallets and purses. He's added red rubber soles to my Louboutins- ladies, you need this if you own Louboutins! He's also added holes to belts, fixed metalwear on purse straps, and repaired many of my shoes. I'm pretty sure he can repair any leather accessory. My friends all agree when they say Moses is the best!
