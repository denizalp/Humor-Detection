I'm reserving a star for the next time I visit again, but I have been waiting to try Eggslut for awhile now every since the pictures surfaced all over FB\/IG when it opened in LA. Now that it's in the mecca collection that is Vegas, all the better! I personally love eggs...throw me an egg with any meal and I'll be perfectly satisfied, even if there's only rice as the other side. This was the first stop we made in Vegas when we got off the plane at 8:30, since I wanted me some breakfast!\n\nYou can't miss it; it's by the chandelier across from Marquee, but do check the hours as they are breakfast and early AM hours  mostly. I had to try the famous Slut. Yes, a little pricey at $10, but I had to do it. Reading the description didn't sound that appetizing...eggs on mashed potatoes? Well...I guess it could be like eggs and rice? It just sounded very mushy. But...give it a shot! Mix your coddled egg into the mashed potatoes with the chives and \"gray salt\" (that I couldn't really see) and let the warm yolky egg + mashed potatoes just melt your tastebuds. Comfort food at its best!\n\nI want to come back and try a breakfast sandwich next time. Watching them grill that bacon is so tantalizing and smells heavenly! \n\nWord of advice; bar seating is kind of limited by their area so if you have a few people, make someone claim a seat first :) Or else you might have to spread out over the lounge chairs near the chandelier!
