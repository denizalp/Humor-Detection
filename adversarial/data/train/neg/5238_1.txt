I had the jadori chicken and my friend had the short rib. Both were delish. The potatoes under my chicken were a little runny, but still good. We had the blue truffle potatoes as our appetizer and it was mediocre, but I wouldn't order it again. It didn't have as much flavor as I typically like. We didn't order dessert. Our service was excellent!
