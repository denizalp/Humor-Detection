Best Italian Food in Arizona that I have found yet! I moved from New York and this has been the first place in the 2 years that I have been here that tastes like it does back east. Definitely recommend this place. I would recommend the meatball sandwich or calzone. They also have THE BEST  pesto I have ever had in my life!
