My love hate relationship with this place seems to be coming to an end. Today went there for lunch with two coworkers. I get that they are typically slow with service, but today they took over 25 minutes to fill our order considering that when we went in the place was empty. Did I mention that all 3 of ordered the same thing so it should have been busy. When I went to the counter to ask about the order, I get the response of, why? Why would you ask me why I am asking why my order is over 20 minutes late. I think this may be final visit, I just can't defend a good sandwich with bad attitude and snail slow service!
