Had a very unique experience at Escape Room Pittsburgh ( http:\/\/www.escaperoompgh.com\/ ) today.  I'm travelling alone and have a free night, so I find that there's one open ticket and purchase that, preparing myself to play with strangers.\n \nI show up at the appointed time.  The party of five does not.  10 minutes later, they still haven't shown up.  Their booking is weird; they've only left a first name and no phone number, so the facility has no way to contact them.  But I've paid for a ticket so they can't just turn me away.  So GC offers two options -- I can wait around for an hour and join the next group (who also has an opening), or I can try the room all by myself.  I go for the second.\n \nSo, I'm playing a room designed for up to 6 people, all by myself!  Some spoiler-free highlights:\n \n* I do the first part of the room faster than GC expects, by far.\n* I fail to notice an early puzzle, but manage to brute-force the lock that it solves.  This leads to some confusion later when I receive a hint for the puzzle I wasn't really aware existed.\n* I receive three hints in total.\n* One puzzle requires at least two people, preferably three, because of physical limitations.  At the appropriate time, GC comes in and says I can order them around.  I do so pretty quickly.\n* At the traditional photograph at the end, I'm holding a board that says \"I ESCAPED!\" -- something that the board pretty much never says (it usually says \"WE ESCAPED!\").\n* GC admits \"we were really impressed watching you go through the room so we looked your name up on the Internet\".\n \nOverall, a pretty fun room, and thanks to the organizers for being accommodating.  The overall immersion of the story was pretty good and the puzzles were a good mix.
