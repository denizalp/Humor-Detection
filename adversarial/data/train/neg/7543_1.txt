This is my favorite Thai restaurant in Las Vegas. It appears to be a hole in the wall but is has great food and even better service. Everyone who works there is extremely friendly and attentive. You also receive huge portions for a low price. My favorite menu items are the green curry, panang, and kung pao chicken. For dessert, the mango sticky rice if it is in season or the honey toast (order with your main, takes 20 minutes to make.)
