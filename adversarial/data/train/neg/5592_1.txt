I brought my iphone 7plus there to get my cracked screen fixed. Phone was completely fine, just a cracked screen. They charged me 200 bucks for the screen repair which is still I bit high but I just wanted my screen fixed so I was fine with that. I pick up my phone and now my phone doesn't even work right. It's a struggle to do access anything on my phone. It's taking forever to write this review because of this. The only and I mean only reason I'm giving them 2 stars is because my phones screen was fixed and not a scratch on it. I wouldn't recommend coming here. I'd rather go to an Apple Store to do it. It's probably the same price if not cheaper and at least they do it where you can actually use your phone after. Now I might have to get a whole new phone entirely.
