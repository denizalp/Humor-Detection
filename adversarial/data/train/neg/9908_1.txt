Guy Fieri's Vegas Kitchen unmistakably one of the best EATS in Vegas. You have GOT TO try their famous Big Eats beef brisket slow smoked for 14 freakin' hours piled high on toasted garlic toast. \n\nI usually like to order my dishes with the sauces on the side. I ordered mine with the BBQ chipotle sauce on the side because I have this compulsive need to control my sauce distribution every time I open my mouth. And eat. Get your mind off the gutter silly. \n\nOn a very serious note once they put that big plate in front of you, promise me you'll pick out two pieces of fries FIRST and I guarantee you will have one of the BEST food orgasms in your life. \n\nI'M GOIN' BACK! Their fries was delicious. Did I say that already? And I'm not even a \"Fries\" kinda gal! LOVE THIS PLACE!
