This is my second time using Red Mountain to lose weight. The first time was about 3 years ago and everyone is just as nice and encouraging this time around! They review all options with you, fully inform you of how everything works and are super encouraging along the way. I can't say enough good things about the staff and especially Jackie! \n\nThe first time I lost over 50 pounds on their appetite suppressant program and I'm back again after having a child. I'm ready to do it again!
