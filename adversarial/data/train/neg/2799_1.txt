This is the worst bar I have ever been to. Extremely ghetto. No service. And uncomfortable waitress. I went there to watch a basketball game. Took almost 30 mins to be asked if I wanted something. Approached to bar to be greeted by the worst waitress I have ever met. She apparently had her boyfriend or friends their and was chatting with them most of the night. I ended up leaving. I am a UTSC grad student and hope to god no one from the school goes there. STAY AWAY.
