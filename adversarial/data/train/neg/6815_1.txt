Stopped by here on a whim one day realizing there was a \"taco shop\" in my area.   Upon my entrance I was welcomed by Ben and Blanca (owners) who took time to explain the menu and also some background on the business.  I felt very appreciated as a customer.  I ordered the California burrito and it was HUGE!!  The flavor was amazing and reminded me of the taco shops back home in San Diego.  Come to find out that's where they were from too.  The carne asada was tender with a slight grill flavor. I could only finish half the burrito but it was so delicious that I stuffed the other half down an hour later.  Take the time to stop by Jefe's and you will not be disappointed!!
