This store is truly a hidden gem.\n\nAfter getting beyond brutal service at the Forum shop in Caesar's I found this store. Even though its smaller than the Forum store, the selection was better, the sizing was better and service was hands down second to none.  The Forum employees could take some pointers from these guys. \n\nI will definitely be making this my store of choice on my next visit.  I can't rave enough about how great their staff are and most importantly I left with my first pair of Louboutins.
