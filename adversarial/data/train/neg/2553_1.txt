This place is a staple for me.  \nHealthy, so you can eat out without guilt.  I love the fresh bowls, but everything is great here.  Don't be afraid to customize your meal...add sauces, nuts, tofu, etc.  It's great for smoothies too... no sugary syrups!   The food is a little overpriced, but it's worth it for the quality.  \nThe decor is simple and clean (a nice change from most healthy vegetarian resaurants)\nCozy, great for a girlie catch-up!
