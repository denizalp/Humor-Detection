The Partner In Cuisine (PIC) have found ourselves dining at Sonoma Grille on occasion and each time, we have had an exemplary experience.  We try to patronize establishments that use locally grown, fresh ingredients and Sonoma doesn't disappoint.  \n\nThe service and food are great, but get your wallet ready if you go for dinner because you will take a hit on the prices.  I also think that some of the salads are quite small for the price, but at least they are delicious.
