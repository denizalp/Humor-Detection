A Japanese\/Brazilian\/Peruvian restaurant in the Palazzo Shops, with a sweet looking interior.\n\nThe menu is a tad expensive ($15 rolls), but the food tasted fresh and the service was excellent.\n\nMy favorite dish was the PORK BELLY RAMEN which came hot in a mondo-sized bowl.\n\nOther items I ordered included:\n-SAMBA JUICE (raspberry and watermelon infused rum, açai, passionfruit, créme de banana, guava)\n-RAINBOW DRAGON ROLL (eel, red bell pepper, cucumber, mango, avocado)\n-SALT N PEPPER SQUID appetizer
