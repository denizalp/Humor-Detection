This place is a gem, so are the two women working here. \n\nFirstly, the insane proximity to the Jane Subway station   makes it just way too convenient.\n\nI walked in  to a gorgeous, clean spa. Great decor, very chic.\n\nSoft music, clean facility, rapid and painless  waxing. I can't express how amazing this place is.\n\nI have been a waxing customer at Indian salons on and off for 15 years and finally experienced  true value, satisfying result - for a very reasonable price. No more driving to Brampton!
