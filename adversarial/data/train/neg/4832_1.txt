I pass this restaurant once a week. Finally decided to dine there yesterday afternoon. The location is not so great but I can get in and out of the parking lot with ease. Love that there are large windows to allow for sunlight. Nice atmosphere and the staff is friendly and very attentive. Started with the spring rolIs for appetizer and my entr√©e was Curry with coconut milk, lemongrass and chicken. It was very tasty. I will be going back again.
