I was really excited to try this place as the bread creations and branding looked so good. However, when I was in store, it was chaotic, and a lot of the baked goods I had hope to try were sold out. It was around 3:30pm on a weekday, which on a regular bakery, it's 'understandable', however this place opens till midnight, are people supposed to wait around for a fresh batch of baked good? \n\nThe price is fairly expensive as well, with some bread ranking at 5-6 dollars. \n\nMy favourite was mentaiko baguette, 'it tastes like sushi on bread' quote my S.O.\n\nI'd still come back to try some of the items such as the desserts that were sold out and have another mentaiko baguette. The front patio provided some nice chill vibe that would be a good afternoon hang out place.
