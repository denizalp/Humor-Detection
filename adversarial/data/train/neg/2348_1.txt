Love their gauc and chips as well as the fish tacos. Daves margharitas pitchers Are my go to drink and it always makes for a good night. Love the playa restos, this one is much larger than the original and just as good. \n\nOnly downside being they do not offer the fish burrito at this location, while to original location does.
