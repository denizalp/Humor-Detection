I really wanted to love Bush's chicken. I generally love fried chicken. So initially, I was excited to give them a shot. My first visit was OK,  just ok... I ordered a 2 piece combo of fried chicken, comes with a roll, a drink and a side. Chicken was good, but very greasy. Fries, and roll were ok. 2nd visit(months later) not any better. 3 piece tender combo, also comes with a roll, a drink, and a side. Tenders were crispy, cooked well, but lacked flavor. Mashed potatoes were ok, tasted instant.  Gravy was good, had a peppery flavor. Both of my experiences were lack luster. The service is fast and friendly, price is reasonable. With so many other choices in the area, I doubt I'll be back any time soon.
