Don't want to compare but I feel like I need to. I have been to the Claim Jumper's near 1-17 & Union Hills numerous times, they have always given great service and the food is exceptional. So I figured we would get the same kind of service at the McDowell & 99th ave location. Sadly not so, we had a guy server tend to us after waiting 15 mins. who gets the drink order wrong. That's OK though. But then he brings another waiter to us saying he was leaving and she would take care of us. OK. So the girl is nice and we get thru appetizers and getting our orders in. Meanwhile the guy server is still working the other tables. We get our orders and a few things are not right, we got food no one ordered and add-ons were brought out late. Also, the brown gravy tasted like alcohol. But we get thru the meal and literally run out. But not before talking to the manager, Lauren. She was extremely professional and polite and took down our comments. I had to tack a star back on because of her.
