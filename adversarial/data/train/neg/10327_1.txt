At first, they did not want to seat us. We arrived at 9:38 and they said the kitchen closed at 9:30. After some deliberation and our party begging for some crab legs they decided to let us come in. The manager was so very nice and let us know he was sorry for not seating us right away and WOW. We had 5 pounds of crab legs steamed and cold and two dozen blue points. The blue points were on point lol. But the crab legs were surprisingly some of the best I've ever had they were HUGE. And the waitress was so nice and joked with us (we carry around a rowdy crowd) and didn't care or cause a scene when we broke some wine glasses and spilled. The manager actually and made sure we got a birthday dessert at the end of the dinner. If looking for some seafood in this area of Vegas I would highly recommend this place to everyone.
