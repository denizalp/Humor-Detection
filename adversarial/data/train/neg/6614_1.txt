This was my first time using CVS pharmacy and it went really well . I went dropped off the medication and was helped by Megan who was extremely helpful and sweet . I picked up my medication with I believe his name is Irwin and he was very polite . I had no issues . They did everything they could to make sure I picked up all my medication at one time (I have strep throat) and was prescribed three diff meds along with my son and they did a really good job at having it ready quickly . They will definitely be my go to pharmacy .
