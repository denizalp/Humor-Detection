We ordered the dinner for 6 for $65 + tax and gratuities. Also added a hot and sour soup, which they do quite well and includes seafood in their version. \nThe set dinner includes pumpkin soup with seafood....good! Not too thick, lots of seafood. Flavour not artificial. \nNext came the stir fry beef tenderloin with broccoli mushrooms and waffle chips. Not bad. Lots of garlic which is fine for us garlic lovers. Overall their dishes tend to be oily though. \nNext is baby bok choi veggies. Nothing surprising. Again too oily. \nTrendee house fried rice nicely presented. Fresh ingredients, one of the few fried rice I have had which actually use good quality chicken. Generous with seafood too. Again on oily side. \nCrispy skin chicken is normal. \nCrispy fried fish with sweet coating is kinda like honey chicken with fish. Bit too sweet for the Chinese palate IMO. Also comes with mayo with tabiko which added to its fusion -ness. Didn't use it though as the fish itself had enough flavour. Nicely fried, hot and crispy on outside, tender and flaky inside. They also sprinkle some corn flakes on top. \nDessert is a small piece of mango pudding, nothing exciting. \nVery good service. Friendly. Clean enough, although some of the chair seats were visibly oily. \nAir con did not seem to be working that night, everyone in the restaurant was dripping with sweat! They need to fix it, that day was the heat wave day too!\nOverall I would come back but mostly interested in their soups and to try their congee. \nApparently same owners as Congee Queen.
