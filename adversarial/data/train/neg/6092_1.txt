On January 30th 2017 at approximately 9:10 p.m. I went to see the movie lion with my wife. We have never been to this theater and probably will never go again.\n\nWe paid for a ticket everything was fine went inside to the concession stand where we decided to buy a few items we bought these $6 cinnamon buns that were really small even for a movie theater. I also purchased a hot dog that also noticed was small as well it was not even a regular size movie theater hot dog. I understand movie theaters are more expensive but at least have a decent sized snack everything here was miniature the only thing that was normal was the expensive soft drink with the correct size. We going to a theater and find our seats. As soon as we set that same soft drink down on the armrest it collapsed forward. I'm pretty sure they already know about this arm rest due to the fact that the floor was sticky around that area and another soda has probably Fallen. I checked the surrounding armrests which appeared to be in proper operation. Highly annoyed I went to the concession stand. I've been informed the lead person at the concession stand that my soda had fallen and that it got all over my clothing and my shoes... he rightfully gave me another soda. But no comp or credit for ruining my clothing. Now normally this is not a reason to not go somewhere again but this theater was showing this particular movie and I don't plan on going there again due to the fact that their chairs were very uncomfortable and feel like I'm sliding off. When I was sitting down I felt as if there was no room to wiggle. If I was overweight I am pretty sure I would have to use two chairs. Maybe I am spoiled because I'm used to going to Rainbow with the recliners.
