Am actually at the shop now.  The salesman was very professional and all seemed to go well as I ONLY came in for an oil change.  I was patiently waiting for OVER an hour before they even started!!  Next thing I know, the MANAGER, Tim Colston is trying to have me flush out my entire system of fluids and wanted me to CHANGE my tires!!  I am at good-year after-all.  Mind you my car ONLY has 36,000 miles and was drivin by an 88 year old man.  The manager, Colston, then got hostile with me when I told him I didn't want him selling me more than I requested.   He was (with attitude) saying \"I'm suggesting\"... So he went aggressively to the back and gave some orders to the mechanic that started working on my car.   Basically telling him to do as little as possible on the car (from what I could see and hear).   After I told him I would be reviewing his aggressive conduct towards me on yelp and started recording on my camera ... and in front of another waiting customer.  The manager changed his disposition and became overly friendly with the other customer and was now joking around.  Prior to that he was mean, quiet, and seemed calculating.  Only till I said I would be documenting my treatment did he revert to going around being pleasant.  My suggestion, is stay away from this place ... my mistake was for asking them JUST change the oil.   What a scam.   I'll be sending a letter to their cooperate office.  FYI, it's now going on almost 2 HOURS .. shame on them!
