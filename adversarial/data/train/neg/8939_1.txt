Sat at the bar and was able to watch the cooks in action.  This is only the second oyster bar I have been to, the first being the Palace Station Oyster Bar, so I will use that as a reference.\n\nDozen raw oysters.  Dozen clams on a half shell.  I would say that the clams were better at Palace Station just for the fact that they were larger but the Oysters were better here.\n\nI've had the  crab pan roast at both of these places and both are very good.  \nThe difference between the two is, the Palace Station version is very rich and you can specify the heat level.  Big Sur's version is not as rich but you need to add your own hot sauce from the table.  Since it is not as rich, it has a more pronounce crab flavor.  \n\nI would definitely go here on my next visit to Vegas.
