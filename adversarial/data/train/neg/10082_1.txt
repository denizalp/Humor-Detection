Most of my yelp followers have trusted me over the years. I happened to read a review about Dr. Tom Willim. This review could not of been further from the truth.   Five years ago when I started going to Warner Family Practice, I was a hot mess. \nI have personally lost over 40 pounds and now  all of my blood work is perfect. I fired over five different doctors looking for the right fit for me. I can assure you I'm not an easy patient, as many of you know this because of my reviews on restaurants.  \nMy results from seeing Tom has been so fantastic I send many of my coworkers from across the valley just to see him. Every single one of my coworkers tell me how happy they are they found the right fit.  \nI have found that many doctors try to make you happy by simply writing a prescription. If that's what you're looking for I guess Tom is the wrong doctor.  I take less medication than ever before and I can't tell you how happy I am about that. I've completed over five Ironman competitions and have plans to do more. I want to personally thank Dr. Willim for everything he's done for me and my family. To say the least I'm offended that someone would put a bad review on him because although I don't know him personally I do know what all of my coworkers and myself think of him. The word is simple ...outstanding and above average.   \nI'm sure Tom will never read this YELP REVIEW IM WRITING BUT ... regardless of what other people write .. my Proof that you're an outstanding doctor is simple.   Anyone would like to talk to me about it I'll be at the starting line November 19 of this year at the Tempe Ironman race. And yes Dr. Willim is a huge part of my ability to do these races.   I guess in a way.....he's given me a second shot at life and I'm not gonna waste it!!
