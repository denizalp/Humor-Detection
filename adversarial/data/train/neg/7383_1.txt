Had dinner. No plant-based entree options!  You guys need to get with the latest research on the best diet for the human body.   The hummus platter was the only truly nutritious dish and it was delish!  The cook was unwilling to put something together for me for a plant-based entree. Now that's just being lazy or arrogant. \nThen my son ordered a whiskey neat and was charged $19!  They didn't tell us until the bill came that they double the charge for a neat. That's a first!\nThe 2 stars are for the decor and the hummus platter. Very disappointed.
