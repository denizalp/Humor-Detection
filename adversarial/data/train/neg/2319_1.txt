I have been to 5 different places in the last 2 years but have never really found A place I absolutely loved..the whole experience. Sometime you like the stylist ad a person but not the consistency of their cut, or you like the cut but not the personality, or the price or something. I was in Cave Creek and tried Sams...wow what a pleasant surprise. Traditional Barber shop look, but better than Expensive Salon service! Sam did a fantastic job, I kept thinking with the time and care he was taking it was going to be a $75 haircut...but nope, super reasonable, excellent service, and wonderful conversation!  I absolutely enjoyed my haircut. For an added bonus stop At village coffee next door and have a coffee while you get a hairdo...:-)
