One of my favorite jaunts for breakfast in Vegas besides the griddle is hash. House a Go go extreme happiness while staying at rio to discover they have one there now\nFast forward to breakfast next day and all I can say is what happened to a great breakfast place? But I think I can come up with the answer, let's take a semi upscale trendy place and stick it where a coffee shop was but keep all the same employees in place and see what we get.  \nWhat you get is horrible inattentive service by people that clearly don't want to be there, no smiles no happiness food served cold and a floor manager that you could not get hold off because he was way to busy trying to look busy walking around in circles while keeping his head high enough to ignore the stares of confused diners who were under the impression they were getting what they paid for.\nSorry hash house love your food but this location may be a huge mistake, it may even keep me from staying at the Rio because I love breakfast but not at this place
