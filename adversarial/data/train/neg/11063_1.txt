I used to go here a lot and the coffee is pretty amazing.  They have, like manic coffee, the \"clover\" espresso maker that is apparently an $11,000.  dollar machine... their latte's better be good!  \n\nThe two guys that work there, I believe their names are Rene and Chris, are really sweet but try a bit too hard to be super friendly all the time... maybe that's just something I would appreciate more AFTER I've consumed my morning coffee.   Looking forward to trying there gellato again this summer... YUM!
