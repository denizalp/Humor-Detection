I have to say, I'm a little torn on this place.  Its in a great area close to the  95, and its convenience is what drives me here.\n\nOne thing I want to mention is they have a lunch punch card: buy 10 get one free.  This may be of note to those who frequent it regularly (its on the back of their business card).\n\nI've had their sushi lunch special a few times, and its hit or miss for me.  You get five pieces of nigiri and a spicy tuna roll for 12.95 along with a miso soup, and I think a small salad too.   There were a few times that some of the nigiri had a weird taste to it, like the way bread tastes when you store it next to bananas (if that makes sense).  Also the fish somehow didn't seem as fresh as it should have been.  It wasn't bad, and I didn't get sick, and I didn' t think it was inexcusably horrible, but I thought I could get better for the price (Tata bistro is in the area as well).
