This review is for lunch.\n\nI have been going here for many years. Recently they have increased their prices by a lot. Now most of their lunch items are priced at $12-13 before tax. The food quality is the same but at this price point I don't think it's worth it. Why an earth would anyone should pay $11.99 for a kimchi fried rice?  It used to be $8.99 that's an increase over 30%. I couldn't order it knowing the old price. What a disappointment.
