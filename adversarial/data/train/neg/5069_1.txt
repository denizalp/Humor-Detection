This place is still great for Wings, but is slightly more expensive than it used to be.  Come here for the big game on TV. I dig how there's a Bar side and a Restaurant side to the establishment. Good stuff.\n\nLove the different flavors for the Hot Wings. My favorites are the Mango Habanero, Hot and Honey BBQ. Their loaded Tots are tasty as well. If you get a dinner salad, beware that you end up with enough cheese to put out a small car fire. \n\nDefinitely worth checking out the Wing Tuesday special.\n\nSuper shout out to Nick! He is a outstanding server that goes out of his way to please his guests. Made sure my Wings were fresh and he KNOWS his Buffalo Wings, too.
