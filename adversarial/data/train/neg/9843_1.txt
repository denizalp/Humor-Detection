I would give this place ZERO stars if I could. I would have written this review long ago however I am still in search of a vet I can trust in this town and my cat needs help. I am furious. My poor cat Charlie has never been the same since Dr Gibson performed a spay on her in October 2016. A hernia developed. I brought her back in December 2016 to only have her cut open again for an additional $200+ to \"fix a stitch\" because she supposedly tore it from being too active after her surgery. Which, by the way she was not. After the \"repair\", Dr. Gibson actually recommended I go to PetSmart and keep her caged for 2 weeks, then to go ahead and return the cage after I was done keeping her in the cage. In any case, 2-3 months go by and her hernia comes back. I refused to get her cut open AGAIN!! How many \"repairs\" is she going to need? How many times to cut her open?? I'm not doing that to my cat. \n\nPrevious cats I have owned were also outdoor cats and much more active after their spay with ZERO complications. I gave Dr Gibson her last chance back in December of 2016 to repair her mistake. Best term to use when it comes to Dr Gibson's surgical skills is, \"incompetent\".\n\nBy the way, anything they did to my cat was behind closed doors. She hated her from the beginning, I should've trusted my cats reaction to this woman. \n\nAs far as the rest of the staff, front office and vet assistants, they are pleasant and try to make it a positive experience. That explains the \"1-Star\" review. \n\nI am still angered and seriously livid with this facility over a year later because I look at my cat and continue to see a hernia in her belly that she did not deserve to have to live with.
