We had dinner at Honey Salt on Monday, May 13 (not our first time there). Many reviews complain about the service, but I have to say that in my many times dining there (15+), I have never had a negative experience with the service. The hostesses are incredibly nice, and often Elizabeth herself is there to greet you, usually with some kind of compliment! I've always found the waiters and bussers to be extremely helpful and friendly, whether I'm there with a huge table of 10 or just a table of 2.\n\nThe decor is amazing - a HUGE improvement from the former restaurant in this space (which I actually thought had excellent food, just no atmosphere). Honey Salt is casual chic and they went to great lengths to achieve that feel: eclectic mirrors on the walls, booth seating around the perimeter, and my absolute favorite part - all of the chairs are different!\n\nThe wine list is not huge, but the selections they have are great, and their specialty drinks are really really tasty. The food is the only reason I do not give this restaurant five stars. It is definitely tasty, but just not stand-out impeccable five-star quality. The curry chicken can be hit-or-miss, the steak is delicious but just not over-the-top special, and I would say the same for the appetizers. I will say that the food has been improving recently, and they have added several new items to their menu like a delicious ceviche (that is served in a really cute way, and I'm a sucker for that). My favorite thing on the menu is actually the burger, which comes with a fried egg on top!\n\nOverall I love this restaurant and absolutely plan to keep coming back!!!\n\nUpdate: Went for brunch last Sunday (6\/2\/13) and we all ordered from the brunch side of the menu. I was much more impressed with the food than the dinner menu!
