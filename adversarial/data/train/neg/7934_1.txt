I always have great service at this store. Today I had an issue with the display on my iPhone and the technician (Raphael) diagnosed and remedied the problem in less than an hour. He was very professional and explained everything he was doing as he was doing it. I can't say a single bad thing about this location, the folks there are always friendly and very knowledgeable about their products.
