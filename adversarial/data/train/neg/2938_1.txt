The bone in filet mignon (I know that is a contradiction in terms) is the finest filet I've ever tasted. The seared ahi tuna was perfectly done and fresh. Service was friendly and professional, a little gregarious but in line with what you'd expect from a Vegas steakhouse.\n\nAmbiance was very nice, decor is tasteful neo-modern. The bill can be a shock, but if you're looking for a quality steak in Las Vegas in an upscale casino environment, plan to pay.
