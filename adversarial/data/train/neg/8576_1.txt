This Sunterra compared to the one in Bankers Hall is absolutely huge; this is a great stop in for lunch time simply for the space.  There are two floors here so not only can you buys things to go you can also take advantage of inside dining.  The second floor is so nice you can really relax and enjoy the views of downtown Calgary and a park.\n\nDuring the lunchtime mad rush, there are several Sunterra employees stationed throughout the market with free taste tasting opportunities. The portions are not piddley so you could actually fill yourself with just the tasters alone.\n\nExpect by weight pricing, so be careful don't misunderstand that the strip of salmon is only $3.00 rather it is $3.00 per whatever gram weight.\n\nFor food selection this is the perfect place to come, if you don't know what you are feeling like for lunch, because of all the visuals and free tasting I can assure you that you will eventually know what your stomach is growling for.
