SO good! DEFINITELY GOING BACK. Was in the area picking my sister up from the airport and we wanted tacos, so we got on Yelp and this was one of the first places we saw. We went and ohhh MAN, we were glad we did! I'm occasionally skeptical of recently opened restaurants, but these guys have their menu and service dialed, perfectly. All of the food I tried was delicious. And I'm not saying delicious the way most Mexican food is delicious when you eat it...I'm talking TRUELY delicious; from the unique flavor of their smoked meats (I had the pork, carne asada, and shrimp tacos, very pleased with each of them and the experience of the smoked flavoring, which was new to me) to their mastery of the classic guacamole side that was impressively fresh tasting and creamy. Speaking of tasty sides...the salsa bar!! Very good. If you are a topping sauce \/ salsa nut like me, you'll enjoy the unique flavors their salsa bar provides. And if there is any aspect of this place that I would rate higher than their food, it was their service. Like others have mentioned, it is clear that the staff at TC tacos place a high priority on customer satisfaction and enjoyment of their product...definitely felt welcome and attended to while eating my great meal. See you soon TC Taco! I'll be back.
