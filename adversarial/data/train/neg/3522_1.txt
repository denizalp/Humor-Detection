I stayed in Montreal last week and was delighted to find this coffee shop just a few stores down from my hotel. The classic black flash iced coffee was just amazing and I loved their breakfast sandwiches. I stopped by just about every day. I wish I could've brought this entire shop back home with me to NY. Special thanks to Michel, for being so kind to us every time we stopped in, and for making the best coffee.
