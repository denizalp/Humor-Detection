I had a toilet which needed unclogging and I've had the pleasure of dealing with Anthony.  I'm very happy with the service I got and here are 3 reasons why you too should consider Mike The Plumber 4 U:\n\n\n\n\n- Plumber arrived on-time, as promised (I was told between 1 and 3 hours, it took a little more than an hour)\n\n- Estimate provided on the phone is exactly what I was charged.  No hidden fees, no BS\n\n- Great care was taken to clean up the area surrounding the toilet once the work was done.\n\n\n\nWould definitely call again if I needed a plumber again.
