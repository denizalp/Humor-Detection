The food was very good garlic knots were awesome. There was a group of us and we got there at 530pm. We sat at the bar and the male bartender seemed very annoyed with having to serve us. When I pulled up the Yelp offer for a free appetizer the pregnant bartender needed to go see if we could use it. Really there were no restrictions on the offer. To me customer service is a HUGE part of me liking a place and they didn't make the cut.we asked the make bartender if you could smoke in there and we think he said no not now after 10pm. But we weren't sure because he mumbled that part as he walked away. I moved away from Henderson but I was there for a party and I won't be going back.
