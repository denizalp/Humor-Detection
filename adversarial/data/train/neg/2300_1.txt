First time on YELP , I am searching to add more stars for this place. I am so overwhelmed to write review for this place .We have no plans for this place but all of a sudden we stopped by on our way. They have a large parking space on the other side of the road which is completely free. Once we entered we found a restaurant on our right (The Farm Kitchen - If I remember right). Early in the morning, you can see couples walking hand in hand and you can hear the birds chirping with a very pleasant and calm weather.\n\nI would like to appreciate the team with my review for their cleanliness and maintaining it so well. Also this place is perfect for wedding venues. However the day we went the farm is not having much stuff as we heard the farm owner maya is planning to close it. \n\nThey have two more restaurants on the back with a beautiful outdoor seatings one could ask for. Any dating places in search off - I would recommend this place a must go.
