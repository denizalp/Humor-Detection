I found this vet by circumstance. I was going out of town on Christmas and had no idea how quickly kennels fill up at this time of the year. I called my current vet, they were full. I called ten other vets....all full. However, one said that west russell still had openings. I called them and ended up boarding one of my dogs there. That was 2+ years ago....I still bring my dog there for boarding. This place is on the other side of twon from me (I live in old hernderson) but it is worth the drive. They are clean, professional, and I adore Dr. Roach. Plus, they don't charge for an office visit for shots. Shots are around $10. You can't beat that!
