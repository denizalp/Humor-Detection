I'm out here every Saturday for work and always stop by in the afternoons. Service is always above average and drinks come out in a timely manner. Clean store and restrooms as well. I feel like a lot of Starbucks have dipped in quality lately, so it's good to see that this one still provides good service and a clean store!
