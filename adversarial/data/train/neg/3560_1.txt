Really friendly staff, and they were in be process of celebrating becoming a \"dementia-friendly\" business when I was there, so that was cool! My cappuccino was good and they left me to my work after they served me. Felt homey and easygoing. Don't have much occasion to go to Sun Prairie, but if I do I'll return here.
