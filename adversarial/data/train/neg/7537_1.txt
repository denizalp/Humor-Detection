I booked an appointment last min online, thought it would be nice to get a trim and style before my Christ party. Had everything timed out perfectly. Got to the salon early, I'm OCD that way, my stylist was 15 min behind (totally messed with my plans). I told her exactly what I wanted, a blow out with curls. Not using an iron, but a round brush. She messed up my cut, had to go somewhere else to have it fixed, and she started blow drying my hair. Half way through trying to curl my hair with a brush she said she didn't know how to do it and used a iron. Not a big deal, except she gave me ringlet curls instead of big waves. Ended up late for the party I planned. Not going back!
