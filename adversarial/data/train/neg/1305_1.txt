This is suppose to be the best of the hotels in Vegas. I've been to 3 star hotels I liked better. They just want all your money here. They don't care if you're enjoying yourself. Hidden charges everywhere and employees that mislead you. \n\nAlso, if you do decide to stay here, don't pay extra for the room with the view of the strip. I did and got a nice view of the front of the Palazzo hotel with a little tiny glimpse of the strip. \n\nWasted money everywhere on this trip, and I didn't even gamble!\n\nIn my opinion, everyone should just stay away from Vegas completely. Or they should just bulldoze the city... You have to be filthy rich to have a good time in Vegas now a days. If you're not, you just get pushed to the side ...Even if you're spending hundreds of dollars. Places seem to start caring about your business when you drop $500 or more all at once.
