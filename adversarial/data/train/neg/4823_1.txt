My boyfriend and I stumbled upon this restaurant after watching the Michael Jackson CDS show. The menu looked good but the food and drinks were amazing!! Our server was very friendly and informative about all the drinks and dishes. He even gave us a little history on how a couple chefs from the food network started that restaurant. We got a pitcher of the blood orange margarita which i totally recommend! It was fresh and had a hint of jalape√±o at the end. We shared the ceviche sampler and all 3 were delicious... Next we got the duck carnitas which were so tender and so delicious! It was just enough food that in addition to the chips, guacamole and salsa made us full but in a great way! I would definitely recommend and Come back.
