I'm so not a donut person but dropped in because it was my duty to bring dessert to a girls card night. Asked the young guy behind the counter for a recommendation telling him it was for '4 old broads playing cards' He gave it a few thoughts then loaded me up with some donuts. I'm thinking, I could probably go to Tims for this but oh well, at least they're pretty. They were great!! I was pretty impressed. And the others loved them. Fresh, with interesting fillings and toppings.
