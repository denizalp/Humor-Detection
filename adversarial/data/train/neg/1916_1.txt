Was starving when i went to eat there last night and on the waitresses recommendation ordered the spicy beef soup which was delicious! Also had har gow and red wonton things for entree. The BBQ pork and duck on rice was ok. For the 2 of us including a pot of tea was $53 tip not included. Compared to other places in Vegas.. Tasty and a bargain and the waitress was excellent. Food came out quick as well. Definitely would eat here again!
