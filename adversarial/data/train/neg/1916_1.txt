Food was bland. Salsas were bland. Music was too loud and distorted in the speakers.  Stained ceiling tiles. When paying with credit card the ticket asks for a tip amount. Seriously?  This is a fast food joint, not a sit-down restaurant with table service.  I don't expect to return. Should have gone to Rubios.
