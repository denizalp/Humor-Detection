I love working transactions with Leslie! She is so professional and informative with my clients. She also works incredibly diligently to make sure that the real estate transactions close on time (or early)! I would definitely recommend her to anyone looking to purchase a home, or who might want to know what steps they need to start doing in order to become eligible to buy a house.
