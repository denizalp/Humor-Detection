I'm really impressed with Hair Bank.  I went there because of the positive reviews and plus, its a quick walk from my house.  Scheduling was prompt and easy via Yelp and everyone there is so nice.  I walked in with hair that hadn't been cut in three years, so it was a long, frizzy mess and walked out with a beautiful new look.  They took such good care of me.  The salon is stylish and spotless.  It was interesting, they cut your hair first and then give you the shampoo!  Which makes sense, why wash hair that's going to just be trimmed off?  The shampoo part was divine; the scalp message was out of this world.  After conditioning and cutting my hair, I had a relaxing blow dry and Jenny styled and smoothed my hair.  The end result was beautiful.  And the price?  $35.00.  I'll definitely make this my go to hair salon and not wait 3 years (lol).  Like I said, very impressed and I recommend Hair Bank.
