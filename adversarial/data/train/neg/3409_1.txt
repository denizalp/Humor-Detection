I love this store! So much selection, and sales people are very helpful, not pushy, they don't follow you around like vultures. There is a discounted selection of furniture in the back too, returned items, or custom pieces that were returned. There are a variety of price points, so that you can be mindful of different budgets. I bought a sofa today, and the sales person was great. I didn't have to go throughout a lot of hassle, and they were able to schedule a delivery time that worked best for me. And they have free Starbucks, what could be better!
