Fry's has poor service. They f**k me up a few times. The sales associates don't f**king care and don't have proper knowledge of their merchandise. I went to buy a memory for my MacBook pro laptop and the guy didn't care looked down on me. I asked him if this memory will be compatible with my Mac and he said that it will be compatible and will work. I went home and installed it and it did not work, wasn't compatible. The sales associate was f**king rude. One time I was there to buy some earbuds, the sales person didn't know about the promo code which I would of saved 10 dollars. I think the sales people do it on purpose. The don't like my kind, especially the filipinos that work there. They are so f**king rude, racist probably.
