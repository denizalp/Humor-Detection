Barely gave us any food, one of our bowls is filled to the top with rice and has maybe 5 pieces of orange chicken. On one of the plates we got kung pao chicken and the lady spilt the juice everywhere on the plate. Another thing is the serving size were a lot smaller than a usual plate , it wasn't just the bowl that had an absurd amount. The manager was there helping out some of the workers but didn't say anything about what was wrong. The line was also was not moving as a regular panda express would , it was extremely slow. I mean in the end you will still get your food so that's something I guess.
