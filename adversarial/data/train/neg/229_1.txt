We travelled from London, Ont. Forgetting it was Valentines this morning we ventured out in the cold to find breakfast. We came here and to our surprise the line out was huge !!! The hostess worked so hard to get everyone checked in took our name and told us about 20min ... Well within 10 we were seated  It's been a bit hard since we have been in Montreal not speaking French but the hostess noticed and gave us English menus. Our waiter must at noticed as well which was nice. Food was amazing service was excellent !
