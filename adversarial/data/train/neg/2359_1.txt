I loved this restaurant, although it may be a chain (not sure). The food was terrific, as was the service and ambiance. We took our waiters suggestions on splitting a few salads (that we couldn't choose from) and a beef short rib flat bread. Everything was delicious. The manager was very visible and he took the time to explain their olive oil and Parmesan Reggiano  qualities. It happened to be a beautiful day and the outdoor seating was perfect. We watched a lot of dishes come out of the (open) kitchen and everything looked wonderful. I believe they really use fresh ingredients, cooked to order and beautifully presented. When visiting Scottsdale, or any of their other cities, I will absolutely return to Olive & Ivy.
