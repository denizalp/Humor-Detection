There are multiple Basha locations throughout the downtown Montreal area and the quality of the food does tend to differ. The flagship location is located on Rue St. Catherine, in the same complex as Sports Experts, what sets Basha apart from the competition (Boustan, Amir's) are the daily specials which are heaping portions of quality for a small price, the Mloukhia (Jew's Mallow served over rice and chicken topped off with a garnish of vinegar and onions) warrants a special mention and is served on Sundays and Mondays. \n\nBasha also is the best place in Montreal for cheap Middle Eastern staples  (read: Shish Taouk\/Shawarma) and is definitely one of the best places to go if you want to grab a gianoromous meal for 10$ or less.
