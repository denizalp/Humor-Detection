Pizzeria Bianco is one of the true Italian pizzerias in Phoenix. They use quality ingredients and you can really taste the love in the pizza.\n\nThey also use a lot of seasonal items, which tells you everything is local and fresh. The wines here are also delicious and the servers really know how to recommend something that will pair well with your meal.\n\nOverall, Pizzeria Bianco is a great spot. The only reason I don't give 5-stars is because it is talked about like it's the best pizza in America, and I think my expectations were too high.
