Nice little piano bar, I have heard about it's grand opening but only just recently visited it. My friend and I came to Don't Tell Mama to finish up the night previously having drinks at DCR. It was a Wednesday and about an hour to closing so only a few people int there. I don't know the lady's name, but she has short hair, she sang a great rendition of Waterfalls by TLC and also sang Melissa Etheridge Come to my Window with the most amazing voice I have heard at a bar. I only had a couple of Stella's which were 5 bucks each. I will have to go back and update this review but I definitely see the potential, maybe I will check it out next Saturday.
