I found them online and bought two pairs of onesies that were on clearance. So instead of paying for delivery you have the option of picking them up at their Junction location. Two days later I got the call my order was ready.\n\nOn a snowy Saturday I made the trek to the Junction to get them. It seems like a kid's store inside. Tight but tidy space.\n\nI informed the girl who was working there that I was there to pick up my order. She stopped what she was doing and got my order. She offered me a bag to carry my pj's in. Then she went back to what she was doing. So I wouldn't say friendly, nor interested to see if there was anything else I needed. \n\nSo I said thanks and left. I guess I'll go back online to see if the have cotton onesies.
