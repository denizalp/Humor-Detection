You would think that when I walked into an empty salon after making an appointment the people working there would be a little happier about someone giving them business. Most of them were on their phones in front of me the whole time I was there. I showed the girl a picture of the shape I wanted, coffin nails but just a tad shorter. She out the tips on fast but fine, but then started trimming the corners way fast like she didn't care what she was doing. They were really skinny but u thought the acrylic would shape them up better and she was honestly going so fast she didn't care what I thought anyway. After she put the acrylic on horribly, I could do a better job, I told her that this was clearly not the shape I wanted and they were way to pointy like the stiletto nails and she said I should've said something sooner. All she could do was make them shorter to shape them or soak them off and redo them which just soaking would take a half hour and I didn't have that time. I told her to just shape them so now I have little sad stubby things that look poorly done. No care at all like I was taking up her time. They were even painted poorly! The manager? up front saw them and said \"nice\". Really?! I meekly said how I wasn't happy, showed a picture and they looked nothing like it. I paid and left no too. When you're customer says she hasn't had a day off in two weeks and this is what you give her, you haven't earned one! \nAs someone who works in the industry, I'm appalled.
