While one of the healthier choices in Arizona, I wasn't impressed with their food, nor their service. I've only been to the one in Chandler.\n\nWhile the fare isn't terrible, I just don't find it overly flavorful. I've had the hummus, and the lavosh salmon wrap. The wrap was pretty disappointing for me.\n\nI'll probably go again just to see if something else on the menu will wow me. And if my opinion changes, I will come back & update.
