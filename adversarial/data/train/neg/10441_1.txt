I don't understand how this place can possibly have any stars lower than 4?  ANYONE from the 80s looking for pinball machines may look no further.  All of my favorite classic pinball machines were at this place.  The best part is, there is NO cover charge.  Just walk in and play whatever pinball machines at your heart's desire.  They have many other classic machines as well including the original Tron arcade, can't remember if it works though or not.  \n\nHopefully this place never dies.  Keep up the great prices, the great selection of machines, the easy parking, and awesome everything!
