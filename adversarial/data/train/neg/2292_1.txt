Reasons why I love this market: \n\nIt's close to my house\nIt's not on a Saturday morning\nVendors are always so friendly\nIt's never crowded\n\nCompared to other markets, there aren't many vendors.  It works for me because it has the basics I always get: fresh herbs, eggs, tea & tamales. I'd love to see more produce but all in all, I think this is a really great little market.
