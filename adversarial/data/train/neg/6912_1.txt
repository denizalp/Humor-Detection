I have been a patient with Linder Dermatology for over 4 years. My first visit was for a mole removal on my arm and Dr. Linder did an amazing job at ensuring the scarring was minimal and pain free. Two years later a second mole was removed from my calve this time done by Dr. Haley and she too handled everything with a lot of care.\n\nI've heard horror stories of women that have suffered from bad cosmetic treatments so I was hesitant to try one of the chemical peels that are offered at Linder Dermatology. However, after the first treatment and the great results I had, I've gone back for a second session and loved the results just the same.  The staff are very skilled and offer great advice to ensure results are achieved successfully. I recommend Linder Dermatology to anyone that asks about dermatology\/cosmetic services especially cosmetic. Spa's that offer such services lack the professional training that Dr. Linder's staff possesses.\n\nOh! And I purchase my PCA Skin care products there as well.  They're amazing!
