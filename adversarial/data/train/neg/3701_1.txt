Worst pizza pizza location in mississauga w\/ regards to customer service. The delivery person sent from this location is consistently rude to the customers. Though I filed a complaint and got my full refund, i also suspect that this person tampers with the food in some way to non-tipping customers so i had pizza pizza take the delivered food back.
