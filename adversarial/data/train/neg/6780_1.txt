After moving towards this side of town, this is my personal favorite Thai restaurant! I love the way the owners recipe for yellow curry, massaman, and Tom kha all taste! I keep trying new dishes when I go and I have not been disappointed. It's adorably furnished and is beautifully done with hints of Thai culture...i am saddened to say that Ava, the owner, is moving away to her other location here in Vegas. (Maryland and Flamingo under Sab Thai) this location was perfect for myself and my bf, but for her service  and her yummy recipes I will travel and bring friends :)
