First, I would like to say I love Guy Fieri!  My restaurant experience on 8\/25\/14 was terrible.  The wait to get into the restaurant was not long, but complicated by staff giving out the same tables.  Once seated, we waited about 10 minutes to get water, etc.  My guy ordered a light beer, but was given the wrong beer.  Once, he explained to the waiter that he had the wrong beer the problem began.  The waiter felt compelled to tell my guy that he was a beer connoisseur as he smelled his beer.  This really appalled us.  The waiter found out that it was indeed the wrong beer!  Apologies later, nothing comped, we ended up waiting over an hour for simple plates of food.  We observed other diners arrive and leave as we waited.  The manager did not stop at our table during our visit and couldn't be found.  I did not leave a tip; only a bad review.
