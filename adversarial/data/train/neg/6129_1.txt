I've been wanting to try this place after reading about it in blogto. I went there during lunch and the place was packed. In spite of the crowd I was served pretty quickly. I got the pain au chocolate and Maman's famous nutty chocolate chunk cookie. Both were DELICIOUS! The cookie is packed with chocolate chips, macadamia nuts, walnuts and almonds. I'm not a fan of nuts in cookies but I will definitely be back for this decadent baby. The pain au chocolate was easily the best I've had in Toronto so far and came a solid second behind some of the amazing ones I had while visiting Paris. All in all, excellent experience and will definitely be back for more.
