For our new house we wanted a few wow pieces we just couldn't find anywhere. Then we discovered Porter's. We went down on a Saturday morning at 8am (by 9am it was swarmed I suggest going on a weekday) and talked with Bjorn. We found some amazing pieces of wood for a kitchen island a desk and mantle. Porter's can do it all from the woodwork and finishes to the bases and the results are amazing. \n\nObviously custom work takes awhile and my only critic would be that it took a couple weeks longer than expected (our main point of contact had a family emergency and was out of office for a while so I get it) - but in the end the results are exactly what we were looking for. \n\nOur General Contractor took one look and decided to call them for a large project in his own home. \n\nWe are heading back down next week to get some more wood for some additional projects.
