I've been there twice.  Each time I ordered something to go.  The first time as I waited for my order I wanted to sit down on the bench near the cash register to wait for my order, but several of the employees were sitting there just doing nothing.  They smiled at me as I stood for 15 minutes waiting for my order.  The manager was on duty and saw this but did nothing. \n\nThe second time the girl at the cash register obviously had not been trained because she had no idea how to ring up my order.  She entered it in incorrectly and a second employee came over and read back my order but it was all incorrect.  When I got my order home  realized they didn't put any napkins or plastic utensils in my bag.  Again, no training what so ever...  Again a manager was on duty this time too. \n\nThe chicken salad was too peppery.  The potato soup was watery and gritty with not much flavor.  Definitely not thick and hearty. \n\nI noticed they had quiches and sandwiches pre-made sitting on a warming griddle that looked like they had been sitting there for a very long time.  It's like a cafeteria style where the food is sitting there until someone orders it. \n\nA lot of the cookies and pastries in the glass case looked scorched on the bottom. \n\nToo bad because I really wanted to like this place.
