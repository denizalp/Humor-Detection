If you a frequent visitor at Russian restaurants, you would probably know that most of them around GTA are banquet halls where you make a reservation a week in advance. Or you go to Yummy Market to get take out.\n\nMoldova really fills in the niche of 'an authentic Russian to grad a bite to eat' and the only one that I know of in GTA.\n\nOf course the key word here is 'authentic'. The food in definitely Eastern European and not every Canadian may like it, but my Russian friends approve of the quality. \nThe service is very honest. \"We are here because you are paying us. Smiling is not included.\" Although, I never found the service to be rude in any way.
