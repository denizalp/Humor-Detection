We have been here before for enjoyable dinners and drinks.  Its ambiance contributed to our decision to celebrate a very special wedding anniversary here.  Tamara, the events coordinator, made sure we had a very special table that was intimate.  AJ, our server, went over the top on making sure we were taken care of in every way.  We started with Prosecco and the mozzarella di bufala with charred radichio.  It took us back to Treviso in Italy.  My husband got Rosso crest di gallo (cock's comb pasta) with duck.  The pasta was cooked perfectly and the flavor was wonderfully rich. I got the cosoncelli pasta.  Beautiful little pasta purses filled with butternut squash.  It could of used a little sauce or butter but if you want to have a pasta primi and a meat secondi, this is the way to go without filling up extremewise.  My husband then had the 25 oz bistecca fiorentina (Italian steak).  The sear on the steak took us back to eating with Dario Cecchini in Panzano Chianti.  I ordered the short rib alla vacinara.  Some of the most tender fall off the bone meat ever.  All of this went so well with the wonderful Italian wines they have on the wine list.  One of the most wonderful surprises were all the amazing vegetable side dishes they kept bringing to the table free of charge.  I could have just eaten the vegetables.  For the desert they provided us with tiramisu but I just had to have the pistachio gelato also.  We were there for at least three hours, just like we would dine in Italy.  Matt Carter, Brian Raab and Mark Drinkwater have done it again!
