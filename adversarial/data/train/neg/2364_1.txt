Not Just Coffee is the best in the city in my opinion. I was thrilled to hear they were opening a new location and even more so when I saw pictures of the new location. Charlotte was in need of such a gorgeous coffee shop. Also, this new location offers food which is awesome. The food has so much attention to detail, it's not to be missed!
