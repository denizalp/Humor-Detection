Been here twice. Comfortable spot with great booths for that diner feel. I got the corned beef hash twice because they use hand cut (not canned) corned beef. \n\nThe coffee is great. The jalape√±o toast is a nice touch. Also, they have plenty of vegan and vegetarian options if you're into that kinda thing.
