Whether you are visiting Vegas or you are a local, the Peppermill is the best place for breakfast! The atmosphere is a little outdated but I love it. I always order the Eggs Benedict and I am never disappointed, you get three poached eggs with one order! The Bloody Marys are to die for, and the sparkling breakfast drinks are good too. I always like to go in the lounge and have a drink by the fire ring something about it feels unique and it's become a tradition for me. Do yourself a favor and come here for the best breakfast in town!
