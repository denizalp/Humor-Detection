Wonderful new breakfast place! My boyfriend and I stopped in today for a bite to eat. The environment is warm and friendly (with lots of windows). Felt good inside. The woman who waited on us, Maria, was kind and knowledgeable with the menu. I ordered the cinnamon crunch french toast w\/ sliced bananas. It was amazing! He ordered an omelet with chicken & avocado. Also very good. We will definitely be coming again.
