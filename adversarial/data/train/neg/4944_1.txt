Found this place on Yelp after GOODTIMES gave me HARD TIMES. \" We don't take same day appointments so you can come and sit here 90 minutes or so till someone is free\" I was told. I say\" you mean even though a barber is available today I can't make an appointment?\"\nYES I was told. C YA\n\nNext up. GOLD COAST BARBER SHOP\nA little off the beaten path and down a small hallway ( TGIF is your landmark)\n but let me tell you. BONG IS THE BEST. He made an appointment for me to come in later that day, shaved my head like a craftsman. Face shave and beard trim too.  Fair price. Half what Art of the Shave charges\n\nCheck him out. He will take care of you.
