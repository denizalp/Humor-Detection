For sure, the best burrito at the best price in the city. Consistent, reliable, the right amount of stuffings, and since I've been frequenting this Adelaide location I have always left smiling. The staff are really nice. AND I just learned today they have vegan guacamole. You have to request it, but the regular one has some sour cream in it. I've tried other burritos - johnny banana, banditos, freshii - and don't even come close.
