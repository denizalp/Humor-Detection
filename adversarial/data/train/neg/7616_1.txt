I live right up the street, so after checking the reviews I decided to go to Tom's Thumb for breakfast on a Saturday morning last month.  Breakfast is my favorite meal to eat out.  It feels the most indulgent to me and I'm a coffee fanatic.  I'll take all you can drink java over soda every day of the week.\n\nYou go to the counter to order - I give the basic breakfast a try: two eggs anyway you want them, choice of sausage or bacon and home fries with choice of Toast.  so, over-medium, bacon, sourdough.  And a coffee.  Simple enough.  my total was $12, kinda pricy for eggs and bacon, but ok.  I got an order number to take to my table.  They have a dog friendly outdoor patio which my pup and I seated ourselves.  The restaurant is more self service than not.  To be expected in a gas station joint.\n\nMy plate came about 10 minutes later.  The eggs were over HARD, the bacon was greasy and soggy and the home fries are a packaged frozen product.  The overall plate was lukewarm at best.  I didn't think you could screw up bacon and eggs, but this is not the dish to order.  They had a number of Mexican breakfast specials on the menu, and maybe they are better.  I didn't want that much food.  \n\nBottom line - eclectic interior, easy ordering, great patio, kinda pricy, bad basic breakfast.\n\nStick to the BBQ; sounds delish.
