What a rip off.  Auto zone sent me these coupons that said if I purchase a Lucas fuel treatment additive, I would get $4 off.  On February 4,  I bought the gallon size and I didn't get the $4 off.  Today (February 16) I brought the quart size Lucas fuel treatment and it didn't give me the $4 off.  I showed him the coupon and my key ring Id card and he said the $4 off will come off the next purchase.  I told him that this is the 2nd purchase and showed him the receipt dated February 4th making today's purchase the second one.  He scan the coupon and my key ring Auto Zone Id and nothing happens.  He then said I need the credit card size Id.  I told him it's the same number, one credit card size and one for the key ring.  He told me 3 times, you need the credit card size.  Even the other cashier said the key ring size I d will work.  Wow, why does Auto Zone send coupons that is not honored, and why do they hire a stupid cashier that blames corporate.  I've given Auto Zone a lot of business and buying oil, filters batteries, polish, treatment additives for my two vehicles and all the past cashiers were helpful, courteous and professional, but this cashier is too busy blow smoke up customer's behind with b.s. answers and just blames \"corporate\".... I'm not giving Auto Zone any more of my business if they're going to hire idiots like this guy. Tom
