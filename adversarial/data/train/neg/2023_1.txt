Amazing sushi! Half off Weds & Thursday so we normally go then. Service is awesome and fast, everyone is super friendly. We get the Fox roll & the Jackpot every time and it's so yummy! You can tell the ingredients are fresh. Highly recommend. Plus they have hibachi tables which is always a great time too
