The first time we came here a couple of months ago the service and food was great. Came here today and waited to be seated in an almost empty restaurant..we waited awhile even though we made eye contact with multiple people working there. We finally sat ourselves down. \nThe Caesar salad was yummy\nThe 4 cheese gnocchi was average\nThe Alfredo pasta my husband added chicken to was good, except for the fact that the chicken was dry and when he told our waiter it was like he did not know what to do. He brought extra sauce at my husbands request but they charged us for the chicken anyways!!! 6.95 add to Alfredo pasta (21.95).
