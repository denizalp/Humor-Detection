Tried this restaurant last night and i am left with mixed feelings. First of all the music was great! Awesome reggae music. It was a group of 7 including 2 kids. This place is not kids friendly but if you so happen to have your kids with you , you will be alright. We ordered a number of things and they all turned out good except for the grilled Steak with chimichurri sauce. The steak was a bit burnt and the sauce was not a good fit neither was any other option brought to me. So i left very disappointed! But my server Kurt i think his name was was so awesome and he tried so hard to give me a sauce to go with the steak. But at the end of the day. I think it wasn't the steak but the sauce that was so much of a problem. So i recommended this place but skip the steak. I am a New Yorker i know good food!
