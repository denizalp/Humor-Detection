My husband and I are always on the lookout for great breakfasts- and Original Pancake House in Scottsdale has been one of our favorites for years.  we just went today and it never fails to meet our high expectations! We have our standard cheese and veggie omelet that is one of the best you'll find anywhere- and their pancakes are a perfect pairing! so light and delicious. the service is as great as the food! It is a chain but they are all different and this location is one of the best we have been to!
