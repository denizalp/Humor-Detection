Such a welcome change of pace for lunch in Uptown.  Parked at the corner of Third and Tryon on many days, Roots offers a nice farm to table offering of unique eats.  Many days, those eats are a variety of interesting tacos.  This Wednesday brought four choices, duck confit, chorizo and strawberries, coconut curry chicken with Thai cucumbers and veggie.  I had one each of the first three for $10 and each was a delicious combo of flavors and textures.  Thanks for the hard work and good food Roots!
