Let me start by saying I left feeling frustrated. The place has a ton of potential, but is just poorly executed. \n\nThe decor, ambience and setting is very nice. \nParking is much better than many other restaurants in the area. \nWaited 40 minutes for a table. Saw many empty tables while we waited. \nThe waitress said all the right things, then failed to deliver. Service was very slow. We had a table of 6 and food came out one person at a time. The first person was almost done their fries before the last person got thier steak.  A different person brought food to our table each time. Every time we requested a refill or vinegar, it was slow or forgotten. When the waitress got the order wrong, she barley apologized!\nThe food varied from boring to very nice. \nAt the end of the end of he night I left feeling very frustrated and do not plan to return. \n\nVeggy burger - boring. 0 creativity. \nRegular burger - average. \nGoat cheese starter - didn't have enough pity for all the spearheads. Garlic was burnt. \nFillet steak was very good, but fries arrived cold. \nPasta dish was average. \nMartinis were great.
