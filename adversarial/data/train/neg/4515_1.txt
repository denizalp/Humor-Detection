I saw the reviews about this salon, and I went to try it out.  I waited to write something until it had been several weeks to see what my hair did.  I loved it from the beginning, and I still love it!!  Eric gave me awesome highlights, they look like I got them from the sun.  The color on my roots he matched up to a tee!!  Give this place a try, you will love it!
