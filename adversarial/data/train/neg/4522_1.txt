Wow, great spot! 50 beers on tap from Canada and European countries. I found Fuller's Black Cab stout on the list, a brew I had not experience since I was in London in 2011. My dining friends enjoyed Belgian, German and Danish options. \n\nFor dinner, my hubby chose the pork knuckle. Our friend, the steak and frites since his wife doesn't eat red meat. Me, wanting some vegetables to balance the beer went with the Town Crier salad. It gave me the chance to try the German Chicken Sausage without the heavy mashed potatoes (which weren't heavy at all).  \n\nSince the spot is within walking distance to our hotel, I suspect we might be back before the weekend is out.
