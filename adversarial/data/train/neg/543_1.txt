Ordered a couch and chair from this location, was considered custom.No issues with the buying process. Issue came with delivery . Delivery people came 3-4 weeks later, placed furniture and throw pillows, and left. Moved one of the throw pillows, noticed left arm of couch had large indent. Frame was broken on the arm. Called delivery guys, they had us call store. Called store, set up appointment to have couch inspected. 5 days later took off work to meet with guy who was to inspect couch. Guy was late. Guy inspected, took pictures, took notes. Customer service finally called, wanted to repair and not replace. This is my issue. We paid for new furniture, not refurbished furniture. Talked to Dani in customer service, who would only give the corporate line of repair only. Asked to speak to someone else, there was nobody there I could talk to right now. Would only offer to have a Lauren call me on Monday. Bottom line is I have paid for new furniture, not damaged refurbished furniture. Buyer beware, this is a shady company.
