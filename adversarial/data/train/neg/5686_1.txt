Awesome little place for desserts. Been here 2 times and have tried different things each time. I've had the vegan cake as well as the regular cakes and they have both been amazing ! The vegan cinnamon cake with buttercream was absolutely the best piece of cake I've eaten in the city hands down. Also the olive oil chocolate almond cake with buttercream was very good as well. Great coffee as well. Cute setting to grab something sweet. It's Lawrenceville so the clientele are hipster so if that is an issue don't go there. I don't care about anything except when I can go back and have some more cake !!!!!!!
