I'm not surprised by the low reviews for here. They are initially not very friendly and I had a feeling they were trying to rip me off. I came in with a flat and just asked him to patch it. He right away told me I must have driven on the flat for awhile and I could tell he was going to try and get me to buy a new tire. I assured him it wasn't driven at all on the flat.He then called and told me it had been patched before, I told him I haven't ever patched it but maybe the previous owners. He quoted me $212 for the tire but they didn't have them. I told him to just patch it and I would price out tires. Again I couldn't tell whether he was just informing me or not...\nWhen I came to get the tire they seemed much more friendly and they put my tire back on and didn't charge me. They were so nice and chatted and joked. Big change from when I initially came in. I would give them another chance!!!
