Stumbled in here drunk on my bachelor party the weekend of October 6th-9th. Drunkenly ordered, outstanding burger, and proceeded to leave my wallet upon leaving.\n\nRetracing my drunken steps the following morning, I realized I left my wallet at Fatburger and immediately called. They said they did have my wallet and I proceeded there immediately. Thank the lord, my wallet was safe and sound. Thank you Fatburger. I will definitely be visiting on my next adventure to sin city.
