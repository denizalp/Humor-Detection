Going to Exploration Park is one of the 100 Reasons Why I Love Living in Las Vegas. My husband and I take our dog for a walk a few times a week usually at night. I love how there is always security around and the park is still popping even at 8 pm.\n\nThe layout of the park offers something for everyone. Lots of grass, walking trails, picnic areas and recreational activities. The play area is huge and they even have a little water park. There is always something happening on the weekends whether it's a dog festival or summer movie nights.\n\nThey keep the park very clean and I love how visitors even show pride in the park by picking up after their dogs. I still haven't climbed up the hill but that is definitely on my To Do List once the the temperature drops down a bit.
