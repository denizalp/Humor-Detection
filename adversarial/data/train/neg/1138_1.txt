I came back here again a couple weekends again, and once again it did not disappoint. Only problem was it was 35 bucks for dinner since it was their \"holiday menu\". Aside the price, the food was amazing. I think its one of the first Vegas buffets I've been to where they actually served steak. Of course I had to enjoy the sushi, crab legs, etc. etc. and the gelato ice cream. Service for drinks and removing plates was pretty good too. \n\nI guess I can say its my favorite buffet now.
