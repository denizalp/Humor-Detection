I don't really know what to say in this review. It's Vegas, so why WOULDN'T you go to Fat Tuesday? My favorite mix is the strawberry and mango with an extra shot, and a jello shot before I start drinking. Prices are super cheap! You can't get that drunk for that cheap at a club, so hit up Fat Tuesday for some day drinking. It'll make walking down the strip that much easier.
