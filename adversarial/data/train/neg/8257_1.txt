Great beer. Great staff. Tiny bathrooms. This is MY local place. Tons of beer, the food aint bad. I most look forward to when they open up the windows in the summer, which turns it into one of the best shaded patios \nin town. \n\nNo tv's though, so I have to stay home to watch the Mavs or Cowboys games.
