Stopped Friday evening for takeout.The place wasn't busy when I arrived. Placed order at bar. Waited over an hour and got no food. Had to ask bartender to have someone check on it, was told it would me one minute, 5 minutes later, still no food. Cancelled the takeout order, paid for drinks (you'd think they would have comped since I was waiting forever for food) and left. No apologies, no manager interaction, nothing but a woman in an apron who came running out of the kitchen as I was leaving telling me my food would be ready in another 5 minutes, I left and got a hoagie from Get-Go. I won't be back again - shame too, because their sandwiches are usually pretty good, the service was the problem here.\n\n*Follow up* E-mailed Primanti's corporate regarding this experience. They requested additional information and followed up with the location. The Harmarville story took full responsibility and admitted there was confusion and they dropped the ball. Customer service sent a gift card based on my experience and advised training will be provided and the incident reviewed as a learning experience. I will give them another try and hope the next visit meets the expectation to which I am accustomed.
