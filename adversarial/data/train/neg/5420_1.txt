A small little tailor by the TTC entrance of Yorkdale mall. Had to get a suit slightly altered (pants hemmed and jacket sleeves taken in a bit). Turnaround was fine, I believe they got back to me after 3 days, but was told 2 days. Lucky for them I was still OK with getting it back after 3 days in time for my event. They did a pretty thorough job, but was a bit disappointed with the hefty price. Maybe that's just the going rate but I may just opt for my local tailor next time.
