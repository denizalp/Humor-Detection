i cant believe i forgot to tell EVERYONE just how much we liked  SUSHISAMBA..  it was a seafood and sushi lovers delight.   we've eaten sushi all over the world,  but SUSHISAMBA really stays in our minds.  i can still see my seaweed salad,  (so good),  and those rainbowdragon samba rolls,  that we devoured before our main course,  a plate so large,  we split it two ways!   it think it was called  MOQUECA MISTA,  something like that,  that included shrimp,  squid,  seabass,  to die for!   it has been a couple months and i can still taste that seafood,  prepared perfectly....  the atmosphere was nice,  so was my company.   we had a great meal,  we definitly will make  SUSHISAMBA our first stop on our next trip to vegas!   WORTH EVERY DIME!!!!
