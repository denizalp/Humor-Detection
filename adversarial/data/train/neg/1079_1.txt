Dr Bracken and his team have cared for several of our family's pets throughout the years. He is kind, compassionate, extremely intelligent and reliable. He is truly everything you would want in a healthcare professional for someone you love. If only all doctors were as wonderful as Dr. Bracken!! He will always recommend the most conservative approach for your pet before trying more intense\/invasive treatments.
