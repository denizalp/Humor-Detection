Not sure where to start.  I called.  They said they'd come out in an hour...WHAT???... an hour.  Sign me up for that!.  They showed up on time.  It worked.  The Tech was a super nice guy (Jeremy).  I was so worried I'd have to wait for a few days and then I'd  get a window of 9a - 5p.  Nope.  And the little lady that scheduled my order was super fabulous too.  I have a regular handy repair guy I could have called but my co-worker used this same company with the same results so I went for it.  It so paid off!
