Terrible couples massage experience\nThe woman who greeted us questioned us multiple times on if we even had an appointment though it was confirmed the day before, and when we were making the appointment she vehemently claimed there was a waiting list (though she offered us a day of appointment). Additionally she redeemed our coupon before we even had scheduled our massages. She personally gave my girlfriend a massage and told us to come get waxed by her on more than one occasion, which at at a certain point felt like an insult. They played very loud, very un-relaxing music the whole time while we laid on tables not made for massages. We could hear everything that was happening in the store around us and it made for a terrible environment for a couples massage. She tried to sell us products and get us to follow her on Facebook while we were receiving our massage and told us about her personal life for 10 minutes out of the 30 minute massage that was definitely not worth the $60 we paid for it. The massage itself was not awful, but felt like the masseur learned how to massage by watching YouTube videos. During our entire experience they had the back door to the store open to the Starbucks drive through just outside. At no time were we ever asked about health conditions or about pressure given during the massage. Before we left she made us pay the taxes on the Groupon, something we've never had to do before. Overall I left dissatisfied and frustrated at the penny-pinching owners attempts to give us a relaxing couples massage. Do not recommend.
