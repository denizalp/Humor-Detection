I come here almost everyday because I like the food. BUT, the customer service is below standard. \n\nThe staff are always more focused on food prep for Togo orders than the customers right in front of them. If I am in a rush or pressed for time, I make sure to spend my money elsewhere.\n\nThe food is also quite expensive for a fast food place.
