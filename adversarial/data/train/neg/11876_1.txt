Most of the time i go here to have dim sum.  The food is average at best and i find the prices pretty fair.  Dim Sum on the weekends...SO BUSY..so prepare to wait at least 30 min.  I would come back cause i like their dim sum and their variety BUT the choices last time i went was poor.  The carts kept going around in circles with the same food item for quite a long time.  Late night chinese rules here.
