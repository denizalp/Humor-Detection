OMG. I haven't been there yet but I'm completely dissatisfied. I had a reservation for 3 ppl and I just called in to add one more person. The guy that picked up the phone was so rude and after hearing my request he impatiently whispered \"oh my god.\" I didn't know if I was calling in at a busy time? It was 4:45pm. But it was a simple request and the call took him only 55 seconds long. So not looking forward to going there anymore :-(
