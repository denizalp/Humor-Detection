This place was AMAZING. I'm so glad I decided to try it on the whim. When I first saw the sushi, it looked suspicious because the chef used a different kind of rice. However, the first bite made it a life changing experience. Seriously. I ordered H3 roll and another one that I can't remember. Both were mouthwatering good! Chef Juno also gave us some free appetizers and free green tea ICE CREAM! \n\nI have to admit it, the sushi was even better than California's. Now that I am back home, I don't know how I will find another place to satisfy my cravings.
