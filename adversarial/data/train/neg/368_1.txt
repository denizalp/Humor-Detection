Love my new stylist, Abbey Jane!\n\nBrought my 4 year old son in to have his long locks chopped and I couldn't have left happier. She was patient and explained the tools to him. I decided after that I wanted her to do my hair as well.\n\nMy first consult was great and she was way cool. Not fake and loquacious, but real and easy to talk to. She is very knowledgeable on current trends and creative with her vision. She also doesn't take several hours from my life and gets me in and out in an appropriate time. \n\nI just had my second appointment with her and my hair turned out exactly as I wanted, plus she showed me how she was styling my hair. \n\nI booked another appointment for extensions and am happy to have finally found the perfect stylist for me and one that I plan to stick with and support as she continues to further herself in the business.\nI highly recommend Abbey if you are looking for a stylist that cares about her work and leaves you feeling confident and satisfied.\n\nThank you, Abbey!!
