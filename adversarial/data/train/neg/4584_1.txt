Dor-Stop Diner is a gem!  Make sure you come hungry.  The apple oatmeal pancakes were delicious and perfectly prepared.  My friend had the raspberry French toast.  Both were excellent choices.  The waitress was super nice and prices were very reasonable.  Great spot and a fun new find!  I'll definitely be back.
