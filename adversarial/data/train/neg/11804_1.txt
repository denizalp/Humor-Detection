My wife and I chose this restaurant for dinner while spending the night in Boulder City. This is a really nice spot with a very friendly and attentive staff. They serve breakfast lunch and dinner all day which is really cool. My wife ordered off the dinner portion of the menu and I ordered their veggie burger from the lunch menu. My wife's blackened salmon was delicious, and the very accommodating staff happily substituted fettuccine with marinara for the mashed potatoes at my wife's request. My veggie burger is listed as a specialty on the menu and was completely homemade with numerous veggies incorporated into it. One of the best I've ever had. My wife also ordered a cup of clam chowder which was very good, and while I was waiting soupless, our server very kindly brought me a complementary cup of their homemade lentil soup just so I wouldn't be sitting there with nothing to do. It was really delicious. If you find yourself staying in Boulder City, Nevada or just passing through and looking for a bite to eat this is the place to go. The staff, ambience, and food were all beyond our expectations.
