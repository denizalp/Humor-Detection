We have used Palo Verde Pediatrics for both of our kids for many years and the experience has been outstanding. Whether it is setting an urgent appt, having to see another dr because ours was on vacation, asking the nurses questions or even getting medical records.... it has all been fantastic.  Oh ....and not to mention that Dr Mike had a hunch about something, sent us in for an mri (against the suggestion of insurance) and a bone infection was uncovered!!  Definitely recommend this practice to anyone with kids!!  They are really interested and involved in the health and development of your kids!
