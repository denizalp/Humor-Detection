They should rename this place \"The Rip Off Palace of Mediocrity\". The food is average and The portions are small. They charge additional for everything.!!! Want cheese on your pasta? That's $1.50. Want bread? $2.75. If you must go here, don't make the same mistake we did and not ask for the prices of the special dishes. We got the special fish dish and was shocked that it was $36 and just fair. Oily and too many favors. Don't bother going unless you are satisfied with overpriced mediocrity.
