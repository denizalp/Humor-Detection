Once again I found myself back at Sun Valley Stereo.  This time with a new car that was all promises and no function for what I needed.  Not only do they consistently provide great customer service, they never try and oversell you on something you don't need.  My car is playing tunes the way I wanted it to when I bought it, and I couldn't be happier with them or their level of service.  Rock on!
