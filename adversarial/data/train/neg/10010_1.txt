Went to bring out two dogs to be groomed.  They want you to sign a waiver if they kill my dog or it gets bit by another dog on the premises that they are not responsible.  So who would be? Oh its no big deal said the lady behind the counter we have 5 more people waiting to be called for grooming.  Well good for you. Beware overpriced,  snob's, don't care about you or your dogs. Well thanks for nothing.  My prediction is your not going to be working there much longer with that attitude.
