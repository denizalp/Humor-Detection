The best investment that I made in a long time! Mathew came out to my home well within the agreed upon window of time, took his time and made sure the work was done like it was his own home. I believe that he spent around 4 hours making sure everything was done right. He really went over the top, cleaning showing me exactly what he was doing and why. His service was definitely worth more than $69.00. (Don't tell Mathew that I said that) I will keep Mathew in my contacts and will gladly recommend him to everyone.\n\nDon't wait until your dryer breaks down from working too hard, or worse, don't wait until you lose your family photos with everything else in your home in a lint fire.
