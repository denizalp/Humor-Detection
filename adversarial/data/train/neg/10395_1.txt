Great place with super friendly staff.\n\nDon't let the outside fool you, its bigger than you think! I have the Original wine burger cooked medium and a 16oz can of PBR (or 3) with fries.\n\nEverything was good and the prices were fantastic! I'd recommend a visit if you're in the area and craving a burger that isn't comercially made.
