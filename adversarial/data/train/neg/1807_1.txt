I usually go to Dee but when I called to make the appointment I was told that she is now working days somewhere else and only works nights at the salon. So I made my appointment with Michelle. Big fat mistake! I am so disappointed in my hair cut. I was letting it grow out, had a picture  with me and it looks nothing like the pic. Very chopped up and uneven. Looking for for someone to straighten it out before Easter. Don't even want her to try and fix it.
