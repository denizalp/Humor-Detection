Les Givres is everything an ice cream shop should be, and then some. Innovative flavours? Check! Soft serve or scooped? Check! The option of cones or cups or sundaes or pops? Check! The option of sitting inside or out? Check!\n\nDuring my first visit I observed a couple order what looked like a huge tasting plate for two, so I made a mental note to try it when the appropriate occasion arose. At 8.5 months pregnant a celebratory occasion came up, and going out for drinks wasn't really an option, so I waddled over to Les Givres to celebrate. And was it ever good! Even with my partner Dave we could barely finish the plate. It was a great way to sample a ton of flavours Ã¡s well as mini versions of the different menu items.\n\nThe soft serve flavors change periodically, be sure to check out their Facebook page for what is currently being served. \n\nSomething else neat is that they make their cones onsite. Depending on when you visit you may get to hear the woosh of the cone machine. They still taste like plain cones, and I still prefer waffle or sugar cones, but still neat to see.
