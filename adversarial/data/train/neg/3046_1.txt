One star is too many. It appears Edge Fitness is being purchased by FitnessFor$10, whatever that is. Will memberships now be $10? I assume not. \n\nHave been going here little over a year, bathrooms still smell horrible, like cat litter. Account was charged double for \"maintenance\" over 6 months ago, yet most treadmills and stairmasters are STILL broken and no new equipment has been added.\n\nThe owner told me he doesn't know the WIFI password. \n\nWaiting for my contract to end, and will continue to encourage people to stay clear of this place.
