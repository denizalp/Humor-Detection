I haven't been to the other gelato places in Montreal but would not hesitate to declare Havre aux Glaces the best in the city. It simply cannot get any better than this. The flavors are intensely concentrated without being overpowering, the pure essence of each flavor delivered in a delectably smooth form. A little on the sweet side, but otherwise, perfection in a cup!
