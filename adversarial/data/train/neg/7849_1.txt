I love NBC and use them regularly for my business needs but this location isn't my favorite. When I called to order my cake I asked the woman 'how many people does the 8 inch cake feed?' To which she replied 'how many people are you feeding?' As if to try and sell me a larger cake. I again asked her if the cake fed 8 people and she said 'at the most, small slices.' It says online that it feeds 8-10 but nevertheless she sold me on the larger size. Fine. Who's going to complain about leftover NBC, right?! When I went in to pick it up today I walked in and there was one employee helping another woman shop for an inexpensive balloon weight for a bouquet of balloons. I waited and waited while they looked at everything in the store. Never did the woman say 'thanks for coming in', 'I'm sorry for the wait' or 'let me get someone to help you'. She just continued to browse with this woman, totally ignoring me, for like 15 minutes. They finally settled on a bottle opener. Once I had enough I finally spoke up and said 'can someone get my cake that I've already paid for?' I could see other employees so I knew that she had more help, how hard would it have been to ask someone to come out and help me (and now another woman) who were waiting? Another girl finally grabbed my cake and brought it out to me and just handed it to me. No apology. No instructions on how to store or prepare the cake. Nothing. While I love the cake, I'll be sticking to the other locations for better service.
