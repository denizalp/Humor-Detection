I have to say I've been coming here for a long time and the fact that they have a sign out side there door that says they should open at 12 and they haven't even opened I have to say is completely outrageous we where waiting there for 30 min no one showed up. There was no sign saying they wouldn't be there but if you have a job and it's to open at 12 in the afternoon you should be there. Employees should definitely be more punctual.
