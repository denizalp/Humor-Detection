Love their fruit loops flavor. I'm a regular and most of the time they would be out of a certain flavor. The flavored teas are delicious and refreshing. I love the ice water in the water chamber, definitely a nice smoke, especially if you get anything minty. On weeknights it's quiet and chill, but on the weekends the music gets louder. Every now and then there's a DJ. The music ranges from hip hop, rap, to ambient tracks. Love the place. Definitely show your school id or military id for discount!
