I was excited to learn that there was an authentic Mexican restaurant in the area, so my friends and I went for dinner. In my opinion if there is one under-rated cuisine in Canada, it is definitely Mexican\/Latin cuisine. Perhaps I am just not looking in the right place.\n\nBorder MX is a pretty good representation and a local place to get my mole on. Our group ordered mostly enchiladas or fish tacos, but everything on the menu sounded great.\nThe mole sauce is delish, the beans are creamy and the portions are reasonable.\n\nThe server was friendly, charming and very helpful. Yes, he did try to convince us on the chips and guac without mentioning there was a charge. I'm of two minds about this. Yes it is uncool to make it sound like that option is included with your meal. But to be fair, who honestly believes that a family run business would be giving out free chips and guac?\n\nMy complaints:\n\n- They had no diet coke on the night we went. I know, first world problems...\n- My meal was served, at best, lukewarm.\n- The chairs are the most uncomfortable I have ever had the displeasure to sit on.\n\nOverall, I will be back to Border MX. I'm a sucker for mole.
