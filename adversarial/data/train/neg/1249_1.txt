I saw a picture of the ham and cheese biscuits so I went there for lunch. When I got the menu I saw the fried chicken lunch special, so I asked the waiter which one I should get. He said \"that's not even a question!\" and ordered me the fried chicken.\n\nIt was the most tender and juicy fried chicken I've ever had. Great batter, not too heavy. It might be some of the most tender and juicy chicken I've ever had, period. It came with a biscuit and watermelon cubes, which had a bit of spice kick to them. I really enjoyed it.\n\nStaff were great! My only regret is that I didn't go back to try the Mac and cheese before leaving Vegas. Definitely worth a visit for next time.
