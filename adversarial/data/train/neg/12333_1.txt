Bobby you have it all wrong, Scott was very polite and offered to get you in the chair right away, you were very rude yet Scott still was very professional. I know because i was in the chair when you came storming in like a mad man, (must of had a bad day) You will not find another barber like Scott. Oh and the next time you come in like that i will throw you out myself!
