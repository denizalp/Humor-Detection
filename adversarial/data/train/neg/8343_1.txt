I had dinner here recently with my coworkers and it was amazing!!! We were a big group but the waitress handled us with complete grace as if we were her only table. Not one drink refill went unnoticed, all of the orders were perfect and the food was wonderful. The atmosphere was fun and homey. The owners sons even came in and checked up on us. I could not have asked for a better experience. Do yourself a favor and make this your next go-to place for a night out!
