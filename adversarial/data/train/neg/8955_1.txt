You have to have a frozen thai mai from here! They are amazing. I also order the honey walnut shrip minus the mushrooms. The bartenders are amazing and always ask if i have a food allergy to mushrooms and will put it on the ticket. The bartenders are very friendly which is why ive never sat anywhere but at the bar.
