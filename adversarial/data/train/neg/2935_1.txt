I had a fantastic experience with The Camp Transformation Center! A friend of mine referred us to this gym because of her experience and the results she was able to get. I signed up for the six week challenge to lose 20 lbs and I'm extremely pleased with the results. I just completed the challenge and I lost a total of 23 lbs. The trainers and support staff were great to work with! They helped me with any questions I had about the diet, the workouts, etc. Not only that, but I've made quite a few friends from my time at the gym. Great facility, convenient location, friendly staff, cool people, seriously though, it's a great place to be.
