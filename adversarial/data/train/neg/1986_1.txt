I have been coming to Hollo's for years, and even though I don't live in Cleveland anymore, there is no place like it! They have rooms full of cardstock and envelopes to meet all of your needs, and it is super affordable. I was able to get paper and envelopes to 50 bridal shower invitations for less than five dollars. This place is seriously awesome! They have classroom decorating supplies for teachers, party supplies, and a lot of other random things like takeout containers, etc. Even though I have lived in two major cities, I have never been able to find anywhere like Hollo's!
