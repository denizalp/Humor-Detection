Let me start by saying we have stayed in many condos and timeshare properties in the past so have many to compare Desert Oasis to. The pride management and employees take in this property is evident. This is not a luxury resort but deserves 5 stars because of its beauty, polite employees, and well maintained grounds and rooms.  It isn't within walking distance to anything special, but it's too hot in Scottsdale to walk outside for long anyway.  It is within close driving distance to several grocery stores and restaurants so is fairly conveniently located.  Since we had a kitchen, we primarily ate and drank at restaurants in town or in our room. The pools here are perfect, with beautiful palm trees and flowers surrounding them and waterfalls. The plants on property blew us away.  We loved looking at the many palms, cacti, succulents, desert trees, bushes, and flowers tastefully planted all over. They even had placards to tell you information about many of the plants and trees on the property. Another bonus is that Desert Oasis isn't a huge mega-resort, so it is easy to enjoy the entire property and get a pool chair. Unlike many other resorts, their pool towels are easily accessible near both pools, allowing guests to help themselves to as many as they need. They set up beverage dispensers of iced, filtered water for their guests at many different locations.  I feel they've thought of every need their guests might have. We thoroughly enjoyed our relaxing time at this beautiful property and hope to go back.
