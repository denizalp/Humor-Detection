This is an upscale buffalo exchange. The clothes tend to still have their tags and are brand names like Kors, Vera Wang, DKNY, Sevens, French Connection, American Apparel, JCREW, etc. The clothes are in excellent quality too. There is a wide selection of dresses. They are pickier in what they purchase from you, but that is because they have a higher standard. The people who work here are very honest and helpful as well. When you sell back your clothes you can elect to get store credit, where they will give you more money or they will give you cash which will be less than the store credit. The only problem I have with this place is the hours. They never seem to be open when they say they are. It has happened to me a few times where I have gone there at noon or 1 and they are still not open even if the sign says open at 11. It sucks because this place is out of the way for me and when I make the trip out during their normal business hours I expect them to be open.
