The first time I went here I was really impressed. Portion size was really good, tasted delicious and I was impressed with the quality of the service and the care that went into making my food. The next time I went I brought my boyfriend. I found the serving size smaller although I ordered the exact same thing And my boyfriend thought the garlic spread tasted a little off. He had concerns that it was sitting out and not refrigerated. I went yesterday ordered a large donair and got the same portion as the medium I had ordered the week before. While at home I thought it tasted a bit funny and upon inspection noticed the donair meat was not cooked through and was pretty much raw in the middle. I feel really disappointed because I feel like that is something that could have been avoided if the guy making my donair had been more focused on providing a good product to the paying customer over preparing his own lunch. I have now felt sick for 2 days and will not be returning to this establishment.
