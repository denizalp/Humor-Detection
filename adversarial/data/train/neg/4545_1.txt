Lava has been going to Pete and Mac's in Avondale for several months now. She absolutely loves the place and has a blast while she is there. Normally she has pretty bad separation anxiety, but when I drop her off in the morning with the staff (who she adores), she couldn't care less when I leave. When I pick her up after work she is usually exhausted and sleeps the whole evening and night. Not only does it provide her a great place to exercise, but it also helps with her socialization. The best part is they give doggy report cards at the end of the day to let you know what your pup has been up to and who they have been playing with. Another bonus is that there is an amazing emergency vet right next door, so if my crazy puppy ever does hurt herself, she isn't far from help. They have definitely earned my trust and business,  and Lava loves them.
