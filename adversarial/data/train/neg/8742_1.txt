Great Mediterranean food. \"Quick on they're feet\" wait staff. Reasonably priced and a great light meal after our hike to the summit of camelback mountain. It had an open kitchen and wood fired menu items like pizzas and pitas. Amazing falafel, great hummus and other Mediterranean sauces. Very authentic, sampler platter.
