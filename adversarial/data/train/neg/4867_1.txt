My son doesn't want me to cut his hair. I got a coupon in the mail and used it. We always go to Amazing Cuts becausw it's just right by us. So we tried Great Clips and the lady did a really good job! My son didn't cry. She was talking to him and making him comfortable. She cut my son's hair gently and to the way I want. We went there by just walking in. They even have a lego table for kids. I recommend this place!
