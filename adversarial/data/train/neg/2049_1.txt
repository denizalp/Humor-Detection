What can I say that hasn't already been said? \nOh, I know. The chicken burritos always have way too much \"juice\" dripping out of them. I'm not saying I would ever stop eating them, I just thought I would point it out since I didn't see anyone else mentioning it. This location has a pretty steady stream of customers, and the food is always good, but the cleanliness of the place can get pretty lacking at times.\nAlso, did you know you can order your burrito with \"double meat\"? YEEHAW!!!!
