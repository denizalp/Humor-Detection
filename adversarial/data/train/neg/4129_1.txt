My husband and I were guests of another couple on Saturday night. We'd looked at the menu online; much to our surprise, the menu online is NOT the current menu. Not a huge issue, but an annoying one and easy to fix. Nonetheless, saw that the menu was \"Asian fusion\", which could be almost anything. Good? Bad? We were a bit nervous to test it out. BUT, were we pleasantly surprised. Everything was AMAZING! We shared a few appetizers. The escargot with edamame was amazing! My husband loved the vegetable tempura, while the homemade Thai sausage was great. Zack Bruell's culinary talents do not disappoint. We also ordered salads and entrees. Big mistake! Way too much to eat! Stick with sharing appetizers and sushi. Save room for dessert, especially the Thai coffee parfait. I didn't order it; my friend did. Was I sorry that I couldn't have HER dessert all to myself. Vibe is young and hip. We are neither, but it doesn't matter. Service was great. One final tip: We were seated in the area that is the outside patio in warmer months. I'd ask to be seated in the main dining room. Just a bit classier for a special night out. That and the wrong menu online caused Parallax to lose a star, but the food is amazing.
