I came in today for my 1st of 6 sessions and I am VERY HAPPY:):) Roseanne works the front desk (and might also be a technician) she's from New Zealand and is very nice & professional. April, she did my treatment, is just as nice and friendly! They took me right when my scheduled appt was, no waiting. They have very high quality lasers. The clinic is very clean and decorated nicely. I'm so happy I found them!
