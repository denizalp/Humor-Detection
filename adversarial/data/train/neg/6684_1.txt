If I ever go missing, I'm here. \nLove love love Ben & Jerry's. \nThis location is adorably decorated. \nOnly thing is I wish it were a bit bigger and less crowded together but it's supposed to be a cute tiny place so. \nAlso only ever one woman working which kind of stinks when it's in the 80s outside and tons of people want ice cream... \nHowever, the ice cream is delish like usual.
