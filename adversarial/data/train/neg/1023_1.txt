This place was alright. Shisha was somewhat on par. We ended up there because the other place next doors was closed. \n\nService was a little slow. We ordered some tea, they forgot. So we ordered it again. It arrived right before we were about to leave. Upon the payment the person was inlcining towards charging us for two teapots. Unnecessary when you only served one to begin with. \n\nTheir greek salad was good though. Tasted good. But some olives and olive oil would have made it a bit more Greek Salad
