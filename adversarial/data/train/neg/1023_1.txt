I have eaten in once and I had take out again tonight - about the 6th time I've had Thai food from here.  It is wonderful!  I really like the place, but since it's so close to my house and my wife doesn't do Thai, I get her Chinese on West Charleston and then bop over here to get my dinner for home.\n\nI have been through all of their curries.  I usually get an 8 spiciness and I could go higher.  Next time, I'll do 9 for a try.\n\nI really enjoyed the one time I ate in.  The restaurant is very nice.
