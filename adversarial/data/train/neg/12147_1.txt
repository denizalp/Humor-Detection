PROs\n- Staff is friendly\n- Drinks are creative and tasty\n\nCONs\n- Bread was stale and shouldn't have been served\n- Many items were WAY too salty \n- My salmon was noticeably under-cooked\n- Desserts took forever to arrive (waiter took a smoke break)\n- The key lime pie was sold out. I was instead given a flakey abomination garnished with whip cream.\n- Decor would be considered classy only at a sweet 16 (I might just be bitter)\n- Food prices were way too high considering its quality\n\nOverall:\nEstablishing good drink recipes is fine if you're just a bar but it doesn't cut it for dinner service. Though ambitions were high on all 3 courses, the execution was very poor and couldn't be saved even with fancy ingredients. I wouldn't have cared if my salmon was Irish, Spanish or Philipino, I just didn't expect to be eating it still squishy. My date, not wanting to ruin our anniversary, politely ate her food but felt ill afterwards from the overwhelming amounts of salt and parm in her risotto. \nSuite 701 is best described as fancy-style food. You're paying a premium for being in a large location in Old Montreal, attached to a hotel and served food on large, ornate plates. I'd like to say that I'll give them another try in case it was a temporary screw up but, with their pricing, it's not a gamble I'd be willing take.
