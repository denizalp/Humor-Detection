The decor is nice, I love that they have a patio out front and the restaurant looks crisp and clean but the food was just okay. Our waitress was very nice and since we were new she did explain to us that the menu is more tapas style and the plates come out whenever they are ready. We ordered the Ramen, Calamari and two sushi rolls. The calamari was not good. There was entirely too much breading and that's all you could taste. The sushi rolls were okay but nothing to talk about. However, the Ramen was the saving grace and was by far the best thing we ordered. The broth had a great amount of flavor and kick. We could not stop eating it, in fact I would come back just for this dish only. Needless to say we were bummed about most of the food and that it was underwhelming.
