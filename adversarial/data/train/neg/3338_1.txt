I really like the concept of Aroma. A cafe with unique Mediterranean options and a vibrant warm interior makes this one of a kind. Add in the fact that it's part of the mall makes it super convenient for all occasions. It's a place I can envision having a light breakfast comfortably at any time of the day. However I found the execution of the breakfast offerings falling just short of my expectations.\n\nWe ordered the shakshuka and the aroma hash. The flavoring of the shakshuka was great. The tomato with the red peppers provided acidity and a bold sweetness from the peppers; it was great to dip the bread into to soak up all the stew. However, I found the tahini to be greatly conflicting with the shakshuka with the bitterness of the tahini being too much for the sweetness of the stew base. In addition, the stew could have been more warm as it was just somewhat just slightly over room temperature.\n\nThe salad of the aroma hash was excellent. Sauteed red peppers, sweet potatoes, mushrooms, and onions all provided a nice full sweetness, all brought together with a lemon olive oil dressing. The bread here was a bit disappointing as they were a bit flat in texture and could have used a bit more of a crunch. The house blend coffee was rich and bold.\n\nValue is very fair considering breakfast offerings of other standalone cafes would set you back a lot more.
