I have had the pleasure of eating a 6 course dinner with wine pairing from this amazing place.\n\nThis is one of my favorite places in town! \n\nThe customer service is impeccable, like Three servers to a table type of service. \n\nThe restaurant is very clean!! \n\nThe fish ice wall is such a site to see, I love being seated near it and watch as the fish come and go from the ice. \n\nThe fish is FRESH, flown in everyday. \n\nThe capers...are the best, hands down! \n\nThe salted fish is by far the best fish I have had in my life. It was very cool to have a server at the table unwrapping the fish from its salty encasing. The server then deboned and portioned out the fish to those of us at the table. \n\nOne of my favorite items is the grilled cheese\/ ya, I said it....grilled! \n\nLove Milos!! \n\nPs, they have a three course lunch for around $25 per person and it's the perfect way to try this place out!!
