Went here twice while I was in town for business.  Staff was friendly and fast.  They seemed to really be working hard.  Food was good, and at McDonalds, of course its cheap.  They even had Wi-Fi.  The place was up to date and clean as well.\n\nNo play area for kids.  This is a very small McDonalds.
