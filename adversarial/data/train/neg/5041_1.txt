Thankfully, I was not referred to either Dr. Gross or Dr. Dao.  I was referred to Dr. Suedekum.  I have had a chronic eye condition, in which my treating physician thought a second opinion and treatment by Dr. Suedekum would be helpful.  In all the times I have been seen by Dr. Suedekum, he has been very kind and informative.  I have never felt rushed; always been able to ask as many questions as I needed.  He has always shown genuine concern.  That being said, after reading all the other reviews about his associates, I would never consult with them.
