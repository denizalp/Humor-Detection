I have been struggling with a sewer stench in my A\/C vents in my condo for the last three years.  I finally found a hard working plumber that wasn't afraid to put holes in my walls and find the source.  He didn't have to tear up my entire house up either!  Finally there is hope to live a normal life again! He is very nice and professional as well.
