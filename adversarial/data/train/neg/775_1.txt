Our chief was great. Fun personality and the food was delicious! The waiter was pleasant and drinks were always topped off. My only complaint is that this restaurant is highly overpriced the overall decor is lacking and seems  to be ver outdated. The restroom was very dirty which really put a negative spin on our visit.
