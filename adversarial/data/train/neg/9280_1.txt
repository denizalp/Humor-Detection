It is what it is. I wanted some hot wings and they delivered.  The wings were reasonably priced as it was 1\/2 price Mondays. The hot wings are hot, not \"hot.\" No need for the suicide side.\n\nThe 3oz cocktails were only $10. Not bad for the T-dot.\n\nMy wife had the fish tacos. She thought they were really good. Balanced, not too oily or fishy.\n\nOur server was a ginger, but he was really good.
