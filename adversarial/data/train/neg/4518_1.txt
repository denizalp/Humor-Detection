thank god we took a walk after dinner because we would've never have gone the following day in heavy rain to stop at the best thing we had while in Montreal. words and stars cant describe how life changing your kouign amann was. the best way i guess,... if you hid your last slice of kouign amann, i would search all over this earth like the holy grail.\n\nwe've had them before but nothing that looked or felt or tasted like yours. its almost a travesty if other places called theirs kouign amann. did a little search after because why did most look and taste so different, but yours is the real deal without going to brittany.....the way they were from the beginning before everyone fusioned it. its like calling sparkling wine bottled in California champagne. the wife described it as a creme brul√©\/flan in pastry form with caramelized crack. \n\nwe could be fanatics but it seems you already have them with the locals you knew as they walked in. as we sat and took it all in, i couldn't leave without having one more slice. I savored every bite and that last was sad indeed. i hope Mont Royal and Montreal realize what they have with you.
