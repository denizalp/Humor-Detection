My Taiwanese friend and her husband took me to this yummy place for freshly made dumplings and noodles. We ordered so much food because we were so hungry. They were surprised to know that we don't have high quality steamed dumplings in Chicago, so this is really a treat! \nSpicy dumplings were so good and came with some rice noodles\nSteamed dumplings are very good and so soupy. \nSnow pea sprouts are very good and good portion. \nBeef noodle soup was decent 4\/5 star\nFried tofu was a surprise because it's not greasy and it's egg tofu! \nWe ordered red bean pancake for dessert and it was 5 star!! \nIf I come back to Pittsburgh again, I will make sure to visit this place. Definitely come early or you'll have to wait because it's a small place. Would love to try their bubble tea next time.
