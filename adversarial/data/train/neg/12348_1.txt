Booked an appointment for two pedi's and a fill in at 5:30 on 6\/16. I described in detail what was needed to the girl who answered so that I knew they could do what we needed. \nWe didn't get seated & seen until almost 6. We wanted basic pedi WITH EXTRA scrub (small extra charge - ok). They tried to upsell me to a package twice the price just for them to make sure our feet were soft. I've been getting my nails\/feet done for 20 years and NEVER paid extra for someone to scrub my feet more. More for massage or hot towel, sure, but scrub?? \nWhat the heck is a pedicure for!?!? \nTilly was fantastic on my nails, but but the ladies on our feet were ridiculously subpar. \nGreat attitudes, but I'm not paying to get my nails done to make friends. \nI have no issue paying for good service but I want what I'm paying for. \nI called back, got transferred to the manager who said \"come in no problem\". \nWe came in (the next day) and got the run around from frantic employees who God forbid something be made right over $5 (supposedly the upcharge). \nWe specifically asked for this. If your employees don't speak well enough English, that is not a patron issue. \nThey had RUDE attitudes & were VERY snippy in conversation. \nMind you I just dropped $100 here 24 hours prior. \nGet serious. \nThey had to call the manager back and I had to get BACK on the phone with her for her to \"cover $5\" for ONE pedicure. Get the flip out of here lmao \nDon't waste your time or money here. \nIf I could give ZERO STARS I would. \nThe ONLY good employee they have is Tilly. \nWe won't be back!! \n\n***Feet pictured are \n-flip flop = my grandmothers feet post pedi same night \n-heel out of the water after we came back BEFORE it was fixed.
