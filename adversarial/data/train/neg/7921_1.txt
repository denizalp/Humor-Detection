Overpriced compared to other Pho Restaurants. They do not put very much meat in the soup. I have eaten here about 6 times,once the broth of the pho was very weak tasting and the beef was very tough. I think they are doing a better job now but they give you about half the average amount of meat which makes it not worth the high price.
