We are here at lunch I had the steak nachos and my wife got the grilled fish tacos. Let me start out by saying they offer you bottled water but they don't offer you regular water then they want to charge you 8 dollars a bottle. The fish tacos were dry and the fish had a strong fishy flavor. The rice and black beans were very good. The nachos was good and the steak had a great flavor. But it's not worth what you pay.
