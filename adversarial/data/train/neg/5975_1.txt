Thoughts: Meats at the carving station- Very Good! Ribeye and Brisket on Point, Carver gave me huge piece.\nShrimp- good, crab legs- too much work \nSushi is awful, don't waste your time!\nMexican Food - Not a lot of Choices \nAmerican- Pretty good \nUnlimited Wine and Beer is Nice!\nPizza - pretty good \nMac & Cheese - Good \n\nI would not go to this Buffet unless I stayed @ Mirage which we did.\n\nReally 2.5 stars! \nFood Quality needs improvement\n\nServers very friendly and Efficient!
