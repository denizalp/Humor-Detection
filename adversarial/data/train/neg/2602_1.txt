My BBQ crave kicked in and I decided to try Smoky Jon's out. It was a Saturday evening around 6-7 o'clock; the whole parking lot was empty. We walked inside the restaurant; whole restaurant was empty. I didn't know what to think but we took our chances and ordered. \n\nMy friend and I went with the 2 1\/3 slab ribs, one pulled pork sandwich, one beef brisket sandwich, corn, and beans. All this totaled out to $31 dollars; not bad at all. We sat down and immediately 10 people walked in, all ordering for carry out. There were no worries at this point, I knew the food had to be good. The food came promptly and at first sight it seemed like it wasn't much.\n\nAfter 20 minutes of hardcore eating I downed my last bite of corn. My stomach was full to the point where I couldn't move; the food was delicious. \n\nRibs - Fell right off the bone\nPulled pork & Beef brisket sandwich - Delicious \nBBQ Sauce on the side - Words can't describe how heavenly it tasted \n\nSmoky Jon's was so good the first time, we ordered carry out the second day. Smoky Jon's 2x in less than 24 hours; not a single bit of guilt. \n\nOverall, Smoky Jon's was great, possibly the best BBQ ever. I will for sure stop by every time I'm in Madison.
