I saw their site had beautiful cakes and a wide variety of flavors. My guests loved it!\n\nThey remade a cake from a photo i found. It looked perfect!  \n\nThey delivered which helped alot for my destination wedding. It was one last thing to worry about. \n\nI would recommend them for all vegas weddings.
