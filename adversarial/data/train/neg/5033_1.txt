My fiance and I went here last Friday for my birthday, and it was by far the best place we went all weekend! The service was great, the drink were interesting and delicious, and the food? Absolutely amazing! Also, our server had great tips for us when we wanted to try some different sake. I'm pretty sure there's not a bad thing on this menu, but I'll have to go back and try them all (which I'm more than glad to do)
