the food was amazing, we ordered four different rolls and loved them all, especially the Baked Alaska Roll. The service was kinda slow, but the place was packed and there were only two servers so that was expected. However, unlike what other reviews said, they were not rude at all. A tip to get seated faster: look at what's open. If you request to be seated at the bar but the bar is full, you're going to wait a while. We ordered twice and got out in under an hour, so I think it wasn't bad for how packed they were (and on a Wednesday night!). Besides, it's worth the wait.
