I don't know if I had my expectations too high for this place, but I found it pretty average for the most part.  I guess you must be paying a premium for the ingredients. \nTheir signature dish \"The slut\" is more a novelty in presentation to me. Basically tasted like glorified mashed potatoes.  The bacon, egg, and cheese is exactly as stated and nothing amazing to write about.  Same is said for the pre-made biscuits they warm up under the broiler. For me,so far, the Fairfax sandwich is the star. I found it to be a nice blend of flavors,which I have no problems ordering each time I go.\nWait is hit or miss, I've been here when there is no wait and other times it is a far stretched line. However the line does tend to move pretty quickly. Seating it limited, which is unfortunate since the egg sandwiches can get kinda messy and a table top would be nice. \nI wouldn't necessarily go out of my way to come here, but if I'm in the area I'm up for it.
