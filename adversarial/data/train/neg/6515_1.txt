OK I have the kids today, I ordered delivery. I was a little concerned about the amount of food as always, expecting a small amount (lunch to boot). I ordered the Chatonese Chow Mein....with a side of crab puffs. WOW 13 and some change. Its Hot and has everything in it a man could love! Beef, Chicken, Shrimp. I have a new favorite!\nThey guys are a class act. I can honestly say, I think that the NEG reviews is just unethical competitors! Try this place, it is the best! Another 5 stars on the deliver guys!\n~J Benson
