Thai One On : Most Disappointing !  One of the worst place I've been too in terms of food and service ... All the food we ordered was Way too Sweet and Overpowering with Sauce ... Most disappointing was that we got all our main dishes served at different times rather than together.  We didnt get our last dish served until 15 min into our dinner  and they even forgot a Dish we ordered !  Upside: Decor is nice and presentation of food appetizing ( Just wish I could eat it ... LOL ). All in All : Wont go back ... ever !
