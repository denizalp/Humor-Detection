My wife and I had dinner here.  We split Bruschetta Crudite and a lovely Winter Caprese salad (with roasted tomatoes).  I have the veal scallopine; it was nice, the veal was very tender, but it needed a little something.  My wife had the angel hair puttanesca and she really liked it.  We each had a scoop of very good gelato for dessert and I had a glass of wine.  $81 total, a little pricey for a neighborhood place.  Our waitress was great.\n\nI wouldn't say \"fantastic\", but a solid very good.
