I like this location. It used to be a Fresh and Easy back in the day. The layout is pretty good and the selection is what you will typically find in these stores. If I had to knock one thing, it would be the cleanliness of some of the aisles. It's kinda weird as some aisles are nicely stocked while others looked cramped and just thrown together.\n\nIt's definitely one of the better locations I've been to, but not the best. I like the location most of all. That is what will keep me coming back from time to time.
