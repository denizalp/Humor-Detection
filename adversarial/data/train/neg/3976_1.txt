I have been struggling finding good Thai in Tempe since my move from Chicago. \n\nThis is the best Thai food I've ever had in Tempe!! I ordered fried bananas and ice cream, vegetarian pad Thai and crab rangoon. The total was $21.63 I would say that's a great deal for the portions and quality! \n\nI got the pad Thai medium spice which was the perfect amount of hot. Giving my tongue a little kick but not overwhelming.  The pad Thai can also come as vegan! \n\nI enjoyed that the fried bananas were egg roll style. Very unique and flavorful with honey drizzled on top.  \n\nThe crab Rangoon came with a little salad, the dressing is a little thick for me not exactly sure what it is.  The sweet and sour sauce for the Rangoons is so tangy I found it to be a perfect pairing. The Rangoons are very full and do not have a super fried taste. One of my favs for sure!!\n\nI would 10\/10 recommend this place. It is my go to in Tempe!!
