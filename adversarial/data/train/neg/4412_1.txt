I was here as part of a larger party (7) for dinner. We were seated promptly, with a reservation, and the service was was initially fine. First round of drinks and our food were timely (although one order was completely wrong), but then he disappeared! I had to go to the bar multiple times to get water refills, which is unacceptable. Forgot ordering another round... \n\nI got the cheeseburger sliders and they were just fine. Nothing at all special, but ok. I tried a bite of the steak tacos and they were much better but still nothing to justify the price. \n\nOverall, I may come back for drinks and people watching (patio overlooks the strip), but I wouldn't eat here again.
