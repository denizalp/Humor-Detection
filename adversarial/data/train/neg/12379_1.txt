Meh, I was expecting more from this place as it is at the Bellagio and they have sushi.  But overall, I don't think I'd come back.  It's not a bad buffet at all, but I rather have the one at Paris Paris.\n\nThe food is fresh and there is a lot of variety, but there is nothing here that has that wow factor.
