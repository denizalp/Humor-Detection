My buddy has been raving about this little gem for ages. Tonight we walked in - it was completely packed. One woman was serving the entire restaurant, running hard to serve everyone. She was very apologetic about the wait, and friendly despite the obvious chaos. The food was delicious - especially the 3 kinds of seafood with salt and pepper (hot). Light, not greasy, the prawns had a good crunch, and the squid was tender. We ordered a plate of noodles and won ton with white flat noodles. Yummy. Can't wait to return.
