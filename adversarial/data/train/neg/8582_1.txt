This is my first visit to Wong's and it won't be my last! Upon entering I was greeted with a smile. I ordered to-go so I cannot speak of the dine in experience. As I ordered my food I was asked questions about the food in order to make sure I was going to receive what I was expecting because there are many variations that it's prepared at different restaurants. After submitting my order I was offered water as I wait which showed they care about their customers. The wait was only 10min. When opening the food at home, everything was to my satisfaction. For being in boxes the food still had an appetizing presentation. The food was delicious! I had the Orange chicken, sesame chicken, beef n broccoli, shrimp lo mein and BBQ pork fried rice. No complaints on any of these items. Definitely give Wong's a try if in the neighborhood!
