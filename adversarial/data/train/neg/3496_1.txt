I've been to several allergy clinics over the years and this one is by far the worst as far as customer service.  Three separate times I have been given an appointment by one of many receptionists at the front desk only to show up and be told \"there is no appointment for you on our books\".  There are literally 6-7 front desk people and they change frequently and you never get the same answer from any of them, mostly because they don't know.  I've experienced long lines at the counter because only one of them is dealing with patients.  Really?  The shot folks seem competent; however, they are not nurses and can't answer any medical questions.  They have to wait for the doctor to ask the question.  Actually, the entire set up of this clinic is not conducive to good medical care.  So, I left it and would not recommend it to anyone.
