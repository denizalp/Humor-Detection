This place is kind of amazing... it's like walking into a time capsule. It's a gem hidden in plain sight. This is my go-to place for before or after event drinks. This is a place you can walk right in without a wait before heading to the Overture or Majestic, when other nearby restaurants and bars might be mobbed. A place to sit and relax instead of wondering if you can be in and out with enough time to make it to your curtain call. \nIf you enjoy comfort, homeyness and a low-key bar experience over hip or trendy digs then this place will do it for you. I've tried some of the food and it wasn't half bad either. The one area that could use improvement is the extremely bare bones restroom that is located in the basement... the ceiling is very low and claustrophobic. I appreciate they are working with what they have and the restroom has been clean every time I've used it.  \nTry it out you may just fall in love with it's mix of epic 80's tunes piped in over the speakers, mood lighting and it's $5 Old Fashions.
