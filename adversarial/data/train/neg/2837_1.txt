It is all about the finished product.... I couldn't decide what to order as I was not familiar with the offerings.  Once I settled one the Peanut Butter S'mores it was one of the most delicious unique dessert experiences you could ask for.  The chef is incredibly professional and pumps out amazing chocolate delights that taste as good as they look.  I wish there was such a place in the U.S.  I will return next time I come back to Montreal.
