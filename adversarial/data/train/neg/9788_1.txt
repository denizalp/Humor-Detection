man i hate vegas... i hadnt been in years... but i must admit... i just spent the weekend there for a bachelor party and had a F*ing brilliant time! and one of the big reasons was this hotel.\n\ntwo top floor suites across from each other were magnificent. all class. great view of the strip and the pool area, a wet bar, tvs everywhere, huge bedroom and bathrooms with hot tub and a shower built for a minimum of two people. for the price... this place cannot be beat. and when i come back to vegas im staying here and eating at bouchon.... which i regretfully missed out on this time around.
