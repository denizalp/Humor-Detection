Loved the service, great vibe, but food a bit meh. Went simple with Prime Rib Sliders and Cheeseburger Sliders. The Prime Rib Sliders okay, but Cheeseburger Sliders had cold buns and were beyond dry. We were staying at NY\/NY and wanted to like the place, but if you screw up a slider how do you try anything else?
