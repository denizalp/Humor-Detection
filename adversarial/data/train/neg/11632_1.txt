So  I really wanted to like this place in spite of the reviews about the slow service and staff getting overwhelmed.  Unfortunately all of it was true. Our server started out really strong but disappeared for long periods of time after our wings were delivered cold. We ordered a pizza and while we were still waiting she came back to our table and asked if we were ready for our check?? We explained that we hadn't gotten our pizza yet. When it arrived it was lukewarm and very dry. It took forever to receive and pay our check and it seemed all of the servers were clustered around the cashier area in mass confusion.  Our water was never refilled and I had to go up and ask for refills for beer and wine. Overall a real disappointment. We have no reason to be back as there are tons of great restaurants in the area.
