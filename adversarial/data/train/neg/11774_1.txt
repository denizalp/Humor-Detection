The price for midweek brunch is $23.99 but if you have a military ID, you get 20% off! I can say it's just fair price with the food they have. There's plenty of good choices. The cappuccino is awesome! I love their mirage pudding with creamy vanilla sauce! Not a bad choice for a brunch buffet, we're happy :-)
