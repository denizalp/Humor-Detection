This new restaurant in the northwest is a nice addition to the community. They offer healthy foods, albeit some of their sauces have high calorie counts. Vegetarians can ask for nearly everything without seafood or chicken, but the actual menu is not very vegetarian-friendly. \n\nThe Gourmet Shrimp Tacos were delicious! The blend of flavors was refreshing. I really liked the rice and bean dip included for the tortilla chips (but a little more salt may have added flavor), but I'm pretty sure it was not vegetarian. I was not a fan of the tortilla chips. They tasted a bit like bagged chips.\n\nI had the Salsa Verde Shrimp Tacos on my second trip; it was delicious! Nick was working the counter and he was so sorry it took a while because they were so busy. He was very, very kind and helpful. \n\nThe restaurant is very clean and the staff was exceptionally nice. Alfredo gets to know your name, smiles, engages in conversation, and remembers you when you return. \n\nHighly recommended!
