Great gym, I love the fact that I can take my daughter with me she loves playing with all the other kids in the playcare area. And I love being able to watch her on camera while I  exercise. I also like the amount of equipment they have available. Even when there are a lot of people there, I rarely have to wait for equipment. And they have a great variety of services, equipment, and classes for my wife.
