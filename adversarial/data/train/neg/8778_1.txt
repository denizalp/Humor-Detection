We had friends from Europe in town so we took them to a night on the town Friday night and thought the piano bar would be a fun stop! The door guys were so rude and wouldn't let one of the males in because he had a small satchel (big enough to carry his passport and glass case). They did allow the female (from our same group) through with a bag pack though! How does that make any sense? We were confused by this and the staff was dismissive and rude and wouldn't give us a reason why or allow one of the females to take the bag. We decided to move on because at this point the discrimination and arguing was just straight up embarrassing. I had assumed that being in Tempe we would not come across any silly issues besides dealing with possible drunk people! The \"policy\" obviously is not consistent unless the policy is blatantly only females can carry a bag. Will not be going there again, just strictly out of principle.
