That was an extremely fun Atv and utv ride!!! I can't thank the guides enough!!! My wife was very New on an atv and they helped her out tremendously!!! The trail was awesome!!! We went early in the morning in the summer and were not hot at all!! Great idea for some corporate event or team building!!! \n\n\nThanks again JJ we loved it
