I've been coming here for 5+ years and never miss it when I visit Surprise, AZ.  I have to say that I'm fearful that Dennis is allowing his standards to slip just a little.  A few things that seem to have changed:\n1.  The Shaken Beef is my \"go-to\" order and has always been amazing.  For the first time it seems to have been top sirloin beef instead of the advertised filet mignon - or worst case, a lower grade of beef.\n2.  Service seems to have slipped.  Very friendly wait staff, but bussers that would walk right by the table empty-handed without clearing empty plates.  Perhaps was just an oversight, but did not used to be the case.\n3.  Lastly, the lobster tail special during the Thanksgiving week was a major disappointment.  Overcooked in the shell, could not get the meat free from the shell and when we did it was a bit dried out.\n\nMy future visits will continue because I just can't miss the fabulous flavor of Shaken Beef.  My hope is that the prior superior standards return - and soon!!
