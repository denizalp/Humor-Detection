- They changed their menu slightly.\n- They don't have mentaiko bacon or lamb pops anymore. I was very sad to hear this because they were delicious!\n- I don't think they have lunch specials anymore either.\n- But the other stuff on their menu is still super yummy!\n- The alii roll is my favorite! It has just the right amount of spiciness; it's not too spicy.\n- And the service is great as always!\n- They have happy hour for food as well as & drinks.
