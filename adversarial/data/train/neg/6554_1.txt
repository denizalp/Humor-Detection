Really excellent little spot! We had one of their crepe dishes, as well as one of their eggs benedict dishes. Both were delicious, as was the coffee, and our server was very friendly. Very well priced food, and it's especially nice that the employees are collective owners.  \n\nThe outdoor seating area\/yard was wet from the rain when we were there, but it looked really cozy.\n\nThis is a great place to go with kids, as they have all sorts of areas for them to entertain themselves while you eat. This consequently also makes it potentially not a very good place to go for a quite meal, but even with kids there during our visit, everything was very enjoyable.\n\nDo keep in mind that they do not accept credit cards here.  Cash or Canadian debit cards only.
