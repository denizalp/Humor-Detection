Great place to meet family and friends.\nOwners are on site to stop by your table and say hi and check on your service.\nVery friendly owners and staff.\nFood was good and fresh.\nMy mother loves the Fried Zucchini....oh and the selections of beers. \nThe rest of our table ordered the Cod.  It was very good.\nFish sandwich is huge.\nFries are excellent.\nThis was my second visit to Carmody's Grille.\nI will be back again while in Pittsburgh.\nAnd YES, I would suggest this place to friends for an evening out.
