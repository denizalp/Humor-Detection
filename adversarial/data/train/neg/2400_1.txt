I was here on Dec 30, 2008.  The girls are absolutely drop dead gorgeous.  None of the girls here were ugly.  I had a dance from a girl from Minnesota by the name of Diamond.  But the cake went to this Taiwanese-American girl I pretty much fell in love with by the name of Chyna...she' s an absolute doll to be with and we both had each other going, will definitely remember her.  She reminded me of Tila Nguyen (Tila Tequila).
