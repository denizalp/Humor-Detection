I got to Neos 10 minutes early, and was told they were running late, that there were 2 clients ahead of me.  Then, after waiting for 45 minutes for my dysport injections, the lady came out to me and told me \"you are not going to believe this, our dysport shipment didn't come in today\".  Why couldn't she have told me that when I got there 10 minutes early for my appointment.  Extremely disappointed in the unprofessional-ism of the place.  She told me she would call me to reschedule, and you guessed it.  No call.  Must be nice to have so many clients that you can blow them off!
