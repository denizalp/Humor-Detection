Normally enjoy coming here, but today on a Friday morning we are told we have to wait 30 minutes when there are at least 20 open bays, supposedly reserved..also TERRIBLE customer service today, wow, so disappointed in top golf. Also there is only 1 employee working the main bar\/restaurant with about 10-15 people waiting in here and we have yet to get served, terrible fail on management today, I hope that this is just a one time occurrence.
