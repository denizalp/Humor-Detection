Food: 3.5\nOrdered: black sesame sweet soup and taro and coconut with sago dessert (see pictures)\nMy boyfriend specifically asked if they use powder or real grounded black sesame powder to make their dessert and the waitress told us they use real sesame here. When we got it, my boyfriend said it was made from powder packets you can buy at supermarkets. I honestly can't tell the difference but if you've been to sweet culture before, you would probably guessed that they weren't at the back grinding up real black sesame seeds for your dessert. In fact, most if not all dessert places just serve powdered goodness. However, we both enjoyed our desserts and the portion sizes were good and has stayed the same over the years. I got my taro and coconut sago cold. Very few pieces of taro and they were quite hard which I don't like. Other than that, it was good. Preferred the black sesame over mine. \nOur friends ordered a mix of black sesame and walnut paste and they both agreed Thad they liked the black sesame more as well so I guess if you're there, give it a try...even though it's one of those boring old timey Chinese desserts.\n\nAmbiance: 3 stars\nHas a minor old China vibe to the place. It's a little rundown. Let's just say, it's very casual here. \n\nService: 2.5 stars\nThe waitress seems to speak limited English and mostly Mandarin. Very little Cantonese. She did the bare minimum of a waitress' job description which was sufficient.
