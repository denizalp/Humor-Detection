Obsessed!!! We live a mile away and finally decided to try this place, now I'm mad I didn't try it sooner!!! Fresh fish, great service! Everything we ordered came out fast, looked amazing and tasted soooo goood! Hamachi kama was perfectly cooked, it was juicy and flaky, good size too! Garlic chicken was packed with flavor. All of the sashimi and sushi rolls had nice sized pieces of fish and were put together with care. Waitress was on point and super nice. I will be going back to this place frequently!
