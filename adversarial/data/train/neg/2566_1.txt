GREAT ice cream!  It's a frequent trip for us from St. Joe.  Don't be surprised by long lines, but they have a good routine and send the orders out very timely.  You can't compare it to Jarlings, as that is frozen custard, but it's still very tasty.  I like that the Facebook page posts their flavor of the week.  Hope they stay around a long time!
