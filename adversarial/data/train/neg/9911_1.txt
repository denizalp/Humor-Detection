I've been getting my extensions here for years (even at the old location) and I feel welcomed every single time. I've only ever been helped by the same guy each time and he has been extremely helpful. I brought my boyfriend in with me today and when we left the first thing he said was that he really appreciated the amazing customer service. Will continue to shop here!
