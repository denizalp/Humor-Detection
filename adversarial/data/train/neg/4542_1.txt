I'm sure like many other patrons, we thought this place was a dessert place when we walked by. We were very surprised to see that it was a Bath and Body Works type of store. \n\nPros:\n- Can test scrubs and feel bath bomb tecture\n- Cute store\n- They have a sign near the register to remind you that they are not carry on friendly sizes\n- Located in the Linq\n- Can customize own body wash, but expensive\n\nCons:\n- $11 - $25 for soap is EXPENSIVE, but make cute gifts\n- Charge $1 extra for the soaps packaged in boxes\n- Don't offer free shipping if they did not have a product available\n- We went to this place 2 times, we forgot to get something for a family member, and the staff were varied between helpful, sweet, and just straight up rude\n- Liquid type products were not carry on friendly
