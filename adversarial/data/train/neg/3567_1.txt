My wife and I recently purchased handguns from Caswell's.  They made us a good deal on two guns and gave us an additional discount once we had decided.  They included a couple of free range cards after the purchase as a thank you.  The sales staff was knowledgable and friendly.\n\nThe shooting range is busy, which is understandable given the current environment.  The lanes have always been clean and functional during our visits.  We have vistsed about every two weeks to stay practiced and comfortable with our weapons.\n\nTheir prices on ammunition is not cheap, but not that outrageous either.  Many times we have purchased their ammunition when no other locals supplies had any in stock.\n\nWe recently attended one of their training sessions on Concealed Carry Weapons, Advanced.  The class was taught by Russ Kimball, over two days for a total of 14 hours.  This is the most comprehensive class they offer on this topic.  Russ' instruction is impeccable. His mixture of standard material, intermixed with real world stories and examples, really made an impact on us.  Since the class my wife and I have commented often, on how much more aware we are, and how pleased we are to have taken the class.  One downside was that the dry fire range was unavailable for our class.  Having paid almost $300 for this training, we certainly expected to get the full benefit.  Russ was very apologetic, but management said nothing to us, offered no apologies, or compensated us in any way.  This was disappointing, but was no reflection on Russ, who set up one of the ranges for us to complete the dry firing section of the training.  We did have a great time at the simulator, learning to respond correctly to threatening situations.  All in all we are very satisfied with Caswells, and completely satisfied with Russ Kimball.\n\nCraig
