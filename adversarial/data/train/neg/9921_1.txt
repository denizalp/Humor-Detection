Weren't sure if they could accomodate our party of 11. We headed out and the manager ran down the street to tell us they were setting up a table for us. They went above and beyond to accomodate us and the service was phenomenal. \n\nLadies, if you have a bachelorette party, this is a great place to start your day.
