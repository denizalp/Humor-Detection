Come here from time to time with friends to enjoy a good time. Today was just awful though. They had 2 members on the staff it took 30 minutes for 5 of us to get drinks and silverware. No exaggeration. When the manager finally arrived on shift she was so incredibly rude with an attitude. Our waitress suggested we don't get certain types of food because they had some complaints of cold foods. If it's messed up, why not tell them to fix it?? Overall I was highly dissatisfied with this visit. The fact that I'm giving 2 stars is due to decent experiences I've had before.
