I've eaten here three times now, and really enjoyed each meal. My husband and I each twice had the Secret BBQ Chicken Sandwich (vegan mock chicken with caramelized onions and peppers in espresso BBQ sauce with vegan mayo, $8). I most recently enjoyed the \"Argentine\" po-boy (strips of seitan mock steak sauteed with caramelized peppers and onions, vegan mayo and a spicy chimichuri sauce, $8). I usually get fresh fruit as a side to my sandwiches; my husband gets fries. Their fair-trade green tea is also very good. Whole grain rolls would be the only improvement I would suggest for the sandwiches.\n\nThe decor is early college student, but we'll continue to return for the delicious vegan food.
