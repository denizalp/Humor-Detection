I used to love this place.  I'd always get the three meat plate which included a strip of korean ribs, maybe korean type beef(?) and a barbeque boneless skinless chicken thigh.  They would all be served on a bed of steamed cabbage with some rice and a bit of macaroni salad that somehow worked with it all.\n\nI haven't been in months but it seems like something is different.  The meats just don't have the same flavor.  The korean ribs were overcooked and the marinade for all three just wasn't right.  There were also little patches of saltiness which is weird.  The cabbage had some grit in it which makes me worry about the cleanliness of the food.  The only thing that seemed to be the same was the macaroni salad - but that used to be the worst thing on the plate.\n\nI'm so disappointed in this place.  It'd be edible with a bunch of hot sauce and if you plow through some of the grit, but might as well go to panda express next door.  :\/
