Stopped in here for breakfast this morning.  Place was not very busy around 7AM.  I got the special posted for the day consisting of 3 eggs, 1 each bacon ham sausage, hash browns (or home fries), toast (or biscuit).  Total with decaf and tax came to $9.83.\n\nGood points:\nI like the decor, especially the color scheme.\nThere was plenty of food for the price.\nJosh gave me excellent service, most of the time.\nThere was not a long wait for the food and it was all hot.\n\nStuff that could use some work:\nWhile Josh directly gave all his customers great service I do not think the whole dining room needed to know about the steak that was served way over done or what mess the closing shift left him, He should be a bit more discreet talking to the rest of the staff rather than shouting.\nI was drinking decaf and there was no marker under the cup so the other waiter almost added regular coffee to my cup.\n\nOverall it was an OK place to go.
