I recently moved to Madison and chose this optometrist office based on Yelp reviews.  \n\nI'll start by saying the doctor and technician were very strong.  I felt like I had a solid eye exam.  My poor review is based on the cost practices of this office.  I've worn the same brand and strength of contacts for several years.  In this exam, they confirmed that prescription was still the right one.  They did not fit me with new contacts.  They charged me $42 on top of the $139 exam fee for a \"contact fitting\".  When I objected because they had not done a contact fitting, I was informed its a required charge whether I get a fitting or not.  I've gone to several other optometrists and never been charged a fitting when there was NO fitting.  I complained and asked the person I was dealing with to talk with her manager about this, and indicated I would not be returning to their office due to this.   After 24 hours, I have heard nothing so decided to share this via yelp.  So $181 for a visit compared to my former optometrist who charge $89 for the same.  \n\nBe smarter than me!  Ask more questions about the price of the services before you go!
