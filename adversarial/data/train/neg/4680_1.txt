Pastor Vance is probably the most passionate and caring leader I have ever had the privilege of meeting. He is the reason I love coming to Hope Church so much - in addition to the great atmosphere and people. His sermons are straight forward, 100% scripture-based, and a lot of the time funny! If I miss a Sunday service, I love that I can listen to the podcast on my phone and can read all of the sermon notes in the Hope app. I plan to be baptized here and now consider this my home church.
