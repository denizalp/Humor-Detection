Golden Dragon used to be pretty good but they changed more than just the inside when they remodeled. The wonton soup is not as good, the wontons have almost nothing in them and they no longer have shrimp chips or anything to go with the soup. They changed their lo mein noodles and they aren't as good. The service has always been sketchy but the food was worth it. The only redeeming factor is their new sushi bar. The sushi is pretty good. I am disappointed with the new Golden Dragon.
