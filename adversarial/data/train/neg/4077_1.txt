I periodically get massages at places for a sore shoulder and it feels good for about a day.  My massage by Jon at BodySmart for the same reason had entirely different results!  I not only felt better for a day, but several days, and now my shoulder is much better after 1 massage.  Instead of just treating the problem Jon is solving it and I should be pain free shortly.  Great communication before, during, afterwards helps the process.  \n\nMy wife also gets regular treatments from Jon and has had fantastic results also.  Jon and BodySmart Massage aren't just life changers, they're life improvers!
