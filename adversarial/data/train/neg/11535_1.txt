Best Towing company out there! My car broke down on the freeway 2 miles from home. I was getting quotes for $95 + $4\/mile, $100, $115, etc and some even said they wouldn't do it because the distance wasn't far enough. Go figure. Called Shaun's Towing and was greeted with a nice hello. He said he would be there inside of 30min and he was. He was fast, proficient, and on point. He got my car off the freeway quickly and even told me to just text him the address and go home so I could get myself and my kids off the side of the rode. He was knowledgeable and even asked if he wanted my car parked in the driveway or on the street. I definitely recommend this company and it only cost me $75!!!!
