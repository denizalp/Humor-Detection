Best Thai food everrrrrr!!!!! Omg I can't say enough about how delicious the food is. If you're a fan of curries, this is your spot. It's a small little family owned restaurant, casual and cozy. Friendly service, fast and fresh. It's my go to takeout place. They also offer delivery. It's by far the best Thai place I've been to (and I really love Thai). Five stars!!!
