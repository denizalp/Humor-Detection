This was our first sushi experience and I was a little nervous to try it.. We originally went on Friday evening at 6 and it was extremely noisy and there were no open tables other than the bar so we decided to make a reservation for Saturday at 5 instead which was a much better choice. We told our server Nick it was our first time for sushi so he explained to us that we had 2 options, we could order off the menu with his assistance or we could give him our price range (we did $60 pp) and the chef could create our menu for the evening so we decided to venture out and let chef create for us. He did not disappoint!!! We had a 3 course meal (each course with 2 or 3 different items) The first course was beef wellington wrapped in won tons with cheese and some kind of tuna on a bed of spinach leaf with white asparagus root and sauce on top.. The second course  was 3 meats on skewers grilled chicken, grilled salmon and rib eye. The 3 rd course was a Philadelphia roll and salmon sushi.. Everything we had was delicious!!! I am so happy I finally came around and tried sushi I am now hooked!! It was our 25th anniversary so at the end of our meal they brought over a special dessert dipped in chocolate with the words Happy anniversary written out in chocolate. I also ordered a drink called Samba Juice with raspberry rum it was amazing!!! The atmosphere is very relaxing and elegant. Our server Nick was extremely friendly and very attentive to our table . We very much enjoyed our evening there. By the time we left around 6:30 it had started to get full in the restaurant and noise level increased so we went at perfect time :)  We will definitely be returning on our next visit to Vegas!!
