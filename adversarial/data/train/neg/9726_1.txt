Excellent BBQ. I got the sampler and the meats were tender and moist, especially the brisket. Sweet & Mild sauce was my favorite of the sauces. Mac & Cheese was particularly good too. This place is comparable to the authentic Texas BBQ I'm used to and I will definitely be back. Employee Ashley was very friendly and helpful in explaining the menu and helping me decide what to try.
