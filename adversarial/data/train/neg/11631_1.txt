I've been regularly coming to this Wahoos for the last year to grab drinks, tacos, and have some fun. Still out of all the places to go on this side of town, Wahoos is still my spot. Thanks to the great rotation of bartenders of Fluddy, Marisela and Isaac, it's always a good time with them. \n\nOne thing that is super important to me about this place is that it's a smoke free bar. I've always hated leaving other places smelling like smoke. The crowd here is always fun, no rowdy college kids, nothing but fun people. \n\nNaturally this is a go to spot for me because I'll never turn down tacos. But the best sports games are always on, all the bartenders I always deal with are awesome. Always fun, attentive, and super friendly. Thank you Fluddy, Marisela and Isaac for continuing to make this place so much fun. I'll be a customer for life as long as these three are here!
