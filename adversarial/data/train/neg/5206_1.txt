Regal at Texas Station is the best theatre in town. They have such friendly staff who are always greeting us with a smile. Their Manager Jeff is such a pleasant person who always makes sure to greet me and my husband when we come during the senior show times. He makes us feel so welcome along with the rest of his staff. It's an older theatre, but we're old so we like it old LOL! Always clean and well maintained. We won't go anywhere else.
