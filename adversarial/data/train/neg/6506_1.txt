This bustling little European flavored restaurant is a local favorite. I love the festive bistro-like vibe and can understand its popularity yet personally have found the food and service to be just average over the years. In spite of that, I still seem to enjoy it a little more each time I go. Before today's breakfast  visit, it had been almost entire year since my last.\n\nMy wife and I ordered the Italian and Mediterranean crepes, which ran $8 each and included golden fried potato cubes as a side. The serving sizes were generous and the crepes were masterfully crafted - very thin with the perfect amount of golden browning - and beautifully plated.  The filling of the Italian was a bit dry; however, the Mediterranean filling consisting of diced chicken breast, spinach, onions tomatoes, feta cheese and black olives was quite good. In fact, I would order it again. We also enjoyed a couple of specialty lattes that were tasty, artistically created and very reasonably priced at around $3 each.\n\nIn the past, I have also tried the the 18 Wheeler, a simple breakfast combo comprised of Challa bread, two eggs over medium, two bacon slices and potatoes. At $9.25, it was a little pricey for breakfast, however, most everything was nicely prepared especially the skillet golden browned potatos. The Challa bread, which is just a fancy name for thick French toast, was just average at best however (as was the coffee.)\n\nService was very good and sanitation grade was an impressive 98 and is consistently in the high 90s. Of course the dining area was packed as usual. Again, although I don't love it, I do seem to like it a little more with each passing visit; that and readily available BOGO free coupons pretty much guarantee another meal there soon. With this review, I am also upgrading them from 3 stars to 4 for the first time; however in actuality, if Yelp allowed such precision, the new rating would be 3.75 up from 3.25.
