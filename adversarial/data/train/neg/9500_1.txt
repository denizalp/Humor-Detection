They shouldnt be considered a sushi place. They just offer 8 types of rolls. We wanted to have sushi for lunch and that ended up being a fail. We had two rolls, that were very small for the price. The tempura roll had only 4 pieces and the salmon had 6 tiny ones. The bento  special wanst very good but there was a lot of different vegetables and chicken. I dont think I would go back.
