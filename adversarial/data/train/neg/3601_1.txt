I'd give these guys 10 stars if i could!!! Carpet monkeys is very affordable and great at what they do! Other cleaning companies were either too expensive, never returned my phone calls or never reponded to the text i sent of the pictures of the couch we were requesting a qoute for. Im glad it worked out the way it did because these guys are that good! I had the privilege of having Joe and Tre clean my 3 piece reclinning sectional. They were very professional, efficent and very thorough with the cleaning! They even offered to do my rug at no additional cost! I also like the fact that they gave me a call before my scheduled appointment to let me know that the were ready if i wanted an earlier service. I would defintely refer these guys to anyone needing carpet or upholstery cleaning!
