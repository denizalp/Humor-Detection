This place opens early on weekends! Ate here at 8am on a Sunday before we headed back home. Since we stayed at treasure island, we received a 2 for 1 buffet ticket. $23.99 a person without the buffet ticket. Anyway champagne brunch is what it's called. I've eaten here before and they used to have pho but not today. Sad. But it's good if you're staying at treasure island and too lazy to eat elsewhere. It's also much cheaper than other places. If you're willing to spend $40+ a person for better food, then go elsewhere. This place is only worth it for the early risers and those who have the 2for1 coupon vouchers. \n\nFood was boring. Just ham, pancakes, bacon, noodles, etc. Really basic stuff. Dessert was simple too.
