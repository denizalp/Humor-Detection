My daughter and I have been all over the valley trying to find the perfect dress to say yes to.  We went to Brilliant Bridal (both locations) and had one of the best bridal experiences to date. The dresses were clean, large selections and FANTASTIC customer service.  The dress prices were unbelievable. We didn't find the dress, but our sales associate at both locations put us into the data base to call if a dress meeting our criteria comes in. They listened to our desires and helped to put us in dresses that they thought would work.  One came very, very close.  I would definitely recommend for you to put this salon on your dress shopping list.  You won't be disappointed!
