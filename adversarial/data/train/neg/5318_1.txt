My wife and I had the Cranberry Walnut Chicken Wrap wrap (2) with potato chips and drinks.  The chips were more than good, they were FABULOUS.  And the wraps were nearly perfect.  OK, I can't think how they could have been better.\n\nThe only bad thing is we're traveling through to see my cousin Tom in Tucson on our way home to Santa Barbara.  But you can be sure I marked this place so I can return easily next time I'm in Phoenix.
