As far as your typical local dive\/hangout joint goes, Razzle's has done a great job.\nI always try to sit at the bar, anyplace I go, but even when I can't, and don't expect good service, they deliver.\n  The food here is typical of a bar, with great daily specials and other choices, always above average, and always good. They do use well water, so purchased beverages are recommended. \n  The prices are more than fair for what you get.\n  The atmosphere is what would be expected of a local hangout place, beer signs, pool tables, jukebox, you get the point.\n  I understand they also have volleyball courts, and a nice outdoor patio bar for summertime fun too.\n  If you haven't been here before, understand it is primarily a bar, so my review is mostly based on that.\n If you like bar food and are not too concerned with your cholesterol level, check out the menu, I recommend trying the Chicken Philly with some banana peppers and a side of onion rings along with your favorite draft beer, to start.
