First time there today because a co worker recommended this place. I have a big truck and have always had a hard time finding a good place. I paid $20 plus tip and I was not impressed  I won't be coming back. The inside of my truck still was dirty and they couldn't even wipe down the inside. I really wanted to like this place too.
