When I tried Bonfyre for the first time about five years ago, I was disappointed. I ordered a filet medium-rare that arrived somewhat grey, and given how busy they were and how unavailable our server was, it simply was not worth complaining. I didn't bother writing a bad review at that time, because I usually given a place at least two tries before letting the hammer drop.\n\nStill non-plussed by our inaugural visit, my partner and I used a City Tin voucher as an excuse to give Bonfyre another try. The trick with the City Tin is that you get $10 off your pre-tax bill after spending $25. Philanthropic mission aside, it's not that much of a savings for the diner, particularly at a place with the price point that Bonfyre has. Determined to get the appropriate bang for our buck, we ordered a few cocktails and the Spinach and Artichoke Dip, and this evening was delightful. The decor was dark and inviting, cast aglow by the romantic light of the fireplace.\n\nMy favorite experience at Bonfyre was my most recent. My partner and I came here for Sunday brunch on my birthday in February this year, and I decided to do something I generally loathe in other diners (particularly when establishments are busy): I ordered everything Ã  la carte. I really wanted eggs, an English muffin, fresh fruit, and well... a twice-baked potato. What can I say? It was my birthday. \n\nWith so many excellent dining options in the Madison area, Bonfyre has never really stuck out for us. The logo\/menu design and location suggest that the restaurant is part of a corporate chain. The decor strives for a kind of smoky and romantic intimacy that unfortunately doesn't work with the space's high ceilings and sprawling layout. We've had a number of items that are enjoyable, but nothing we've recommended to friends. I'll probably try it again at some point, maybe in the winter when I don't want to drive far.
