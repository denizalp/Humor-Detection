Reading all reviews made me so excited , but ... I liked the place and the food was ok although I think it was a bit pricey compared to other Mexican restaurants with the same vibe . \nBut it wasn't what I was hoping for , I don't know maybe I'm more used to the Americanized version of Mexican food .
