I found VEGAS ALL NITE through Yelp. In planning my epic birthday party in Vegas, I realized I need transportation for all my friends (19 people) from the restaurant to the Hard Rock, where we all had tickets to see Magic Mike Live. I'm budget conscious, but I also want everyone to have a good time, especially because not everyone knew one another. After reading reviews for VEGAS ALL NITE, I sent them a message on Yelp. Yelp also allowed me to send the same message request to other vendors, which would help me price match. Out of all of the vendors I contacted, VEGAS ALL NITE was not only quick, but personal in their response. One of the vendors just referred me to their website for info, and the others responded with a copied and pasted price. Gregory Miller, the owner of VEGAS ALL NITE, reached out to me in a personable way, and communicated with me quickly, answering all my questions. After receiving quotes from the vendors, his price was the best and most practical for my needs. I needed some time to decide, and the date I needed transportation was closing in quick. Gregory was extremely helpful in helping me make my decision for a 24 seat party bus (over the 22 seat stretch Hummer), and I'm so glad we went with it. It was easy to pay for the bus and include the tip over the phone, and I received documents via e-mail - invoice, contract, etc. The day of, I communicated with them and received a text from the driver so I could keep in touch as well. The PARTY BUS from VEGAS ALL NITE was one of my favorite parts of the weekend. The driver was friendly and helpful, and everyone had a great time. I highly recommend VEGAS ALL NITE and plan to book with them for my next outing in Sin City! Thanks so much, Gregory and staff!
