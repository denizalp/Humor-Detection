I used to love this place until this past year. The service and operations has gone downhill. They are always out of nearly all their ingredients for their breakfast menu and recently, they could not make COFFEE because their machines were down. Yes, this can happen, but usually a business scrabbles to get things like this fixed. At Tammie Coe, they don't give a crap. It almost seems as if the owners have neglected the Downtown Phoenix location over the past year or so. The desserts are still good, but the service and the employees are awful. It;s really frustrating to go there and not know what you are going to get -  sometimes it's a 30 min wait for iced coffee (not b\/c they are busy), employees that can't seem to get your order right, or a large list of menu items that they are out of. They also stopped doing breakfast on the weekends - which makes no sense. I might be b\/c they only had one cook, and when he was gone they would just close the kitchen randomly without any sign on the door or anything not the website. \n\nI'm really bummed, I used to love their food, but after COUNTLESS chances resulting in disappointment this past year, I am done. I think it really sucks that they don't care to keep things stocked and operational for their Downtown patrons.
