Well first off, the service is awful. I will say it's pretty inexpensive especially being in it's in a relatively high end casino so that's nice but the food just isn't that good. My friend and I ordered two completely different dishes but both got the same - essentially chicken lo mein. My other two friends both got soups and both were subpar at best. The worst part was the water tasted like they pulled it from an aquarium, not a plus.  Anyway, I'd tried to elsewhere if you have time and haven't yet lost all your money on the craps table.
