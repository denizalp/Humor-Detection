We were looking for a quick place to eat breakfast before catching a flight back home and popped in here. Cute place. Didn't realize until after we received our order that it was a gluten free restaurant, so I didn't love the bread on my breakfast sandwich, but the eggs, sausage and bacon were all good. Mainly I just want to make sure people know everything is made as you order it so the service is on the slower side but if you have the time it would be a nice place to sit and chill.
