I will definitely be back AND am sending all my friends! Tamar is great! Very knowledgable, from the moment I got there she was cheery and sweet and welcoming. She explained the entire process as she was doing it and her claims of a PAINLESS procedure are 100% TRUE! I have never had a painless teeth whitening experience so this has me excited knowing I can keep going back! My results are phenomenal! She got me to I believe a -1 or a 1 I can't remember but my teeth are all matching and MUCH whiter and brighter. Thanks Tamar! I'll be back!!
