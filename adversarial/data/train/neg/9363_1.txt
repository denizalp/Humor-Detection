Our visit started out good. Went there to see Back to the Future last night at 7pm with my husband and 13 & 17 year old kids to see this classic on the big screen. My kids never watch these classics all the way through at home so we took them to be able to appreciate the movie. Anyhow, we got there about an hour early so we got pepperoni pizzas, popcorn and sodas. Everything tasted good, but overpriced, as expected. Not a big a deal. I have that stub card so there's deals to get with that.\n\nSeating was great, our theater 22 had very spacious seating between the rows and it was clean and comfy. \n\nThe problems came when a couple came in and decided that they needed to talk over the movie.  They weren't young either, and those types usually stop once the movie gets going. But no. They were so loud even after turning around and making it obvious that they were disturbing us.  We finally moved to the back of the theater about the time Marty was in the coffee shop with his dad for the first time. They were still loud throughout the rest of the movie but at least they weren't directly behind us and I wasn't agitated enough to fight with them. It's hard enough to get my husband to the movies and it's people like this that keeps him from going with us and enjoying himself.  It would have been nice if there was staff around that would come in there once on a while. At least they would shut up for a little bit.\n\nI won't forget the lady,  she was the worst. She had long hair that resembled Dee Snyder back in the day but with red pink blue dye in it that made her look insane.  I hope she reads this but she probably won't as she is most likely illiterate. I digress.  \n\nThat was reason enough that we won't be back.
