Who would ever say no to fried chicken and beer?\n\nActually - oddly enough I might since I am not a super huge fan of chicken, and usually only like it when its fried, or in a sandwich masked with a ton of toppings.\n\nBut, this place has succeeded and dissolved a little bit more of my distaste for the ugly bird!\n\nWe ordered the half&half - comes with 1\/2 plain fried chicken and 1\/2 spicy saucy chicken. Both were amazing and I still can't pick the winner. The plain was super crispy, moist and tender inside, and the batter tasted amazing. The spicy was nice and saucy while the batter was still crispy. It is very spicy though so be warned! \n\nThe price point for this + a pitcher of beer (korean combo style) was about $26-$30 and well worth it. Two of us only made it through half of the chicken (one of us being a boy with a very healthy appetite) and we had a ton of leftovers. Another perk - the chicken is cut up in many different ways so you get some wing, some bones, some nuggets, big and small pieces... a great variety.\n\nComes with your typical K-side dishes such as salad and delicious corn on a hot plate.\n\nService was just alright which is why I gave it a 4.\n\nWill be back! Give it a try when you are in the area, or there is another location just down the road at Yonge and Cummer which tends to be a lot less busy :)
