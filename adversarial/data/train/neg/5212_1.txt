Hands down favorite coffee in Madison, Wisconsin, and maybe even the world. Well, I haven't traveled the whole world, but it's definitely some of the best coffee I've ever had, hands down.\n\nMaybe it's just my taste buds, but EVP makes their coffee perfectly. It's just strong enough, dark enough yet light enough, and always delicious. I loved coming here and then to the little outpost in the VA Hospital on my work breaks. Ever since I moved, I've missed this place. \n\nAnd, for what it's worth, prices are reasonable. :)
