I was there about a week and a half ago but finally have time to write this. Perfect hole in the wall spot in downtown Las Vegas. I ordered the pokemonster which I highly recommend, the absolute best I've ever had! Big serving and fills you up fast! Reasonably priced and staff is super cool and engaged with us in conversation plus provided useful tips for us visitors, such a cozy little spot, perfect if you wanna chill lo key and away from the Strip crayziness. We are def stopping by next trip!
