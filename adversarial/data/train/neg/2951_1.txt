This was our first time here and the food was amazing. The customer service could have been better. We ate there so they brought us chips and salsa the salsa was really good but the chips they served us were crumbs. The wait time wasn't as bad as expected. Which was a plus since we were starving. I will definately be going back the food is worth it.
