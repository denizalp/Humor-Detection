I had reservations about bringing my BMW here, guess I thought that a German car needed a German or foreign mechanic, boy was I wrong.  These guys just know cars!  They were able to address all of the warning light issues, replaced my brake pads and rotors with BMW authorized parts, did it in half a day and they didn't upsell me on ANYTHING!  In fact, I had a few concerns I mentioned to them about belts, hoses and the heating and cooling.  They told me they checked everything out, test drove it twice and there was no cause for concern.  What?!  A mechanic that doesn't try to replace everything under the hood needlessly?  Unheard of!  The car drives beautifully and I payed three times less than what the dealership would have charged.  I'm bringing my Kia in to them in two weeks, these guys are amazing and my new mechanics for as long as I own these cars!  Highly recommended, knowledgeable, professional, friendly, honest and timely.
