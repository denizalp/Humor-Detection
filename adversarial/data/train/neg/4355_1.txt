Chinese food done well. I suggest the duck, Chen Fung dumplings either in chicken or shrimp. The duck is served with mini pancakes, apple slices and green onions to make your own dish. These were my favourite from the 12 dishes we tried. The food was overall quite delicious and the service was on point. The ambiance was nice as well and I would hope to return again for these dishes I described above.
