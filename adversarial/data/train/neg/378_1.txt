One of many (if not the best) pho restaurants in Mississauga, it's run by a family who makes their pho fresh and homemade. It does have a restaurant quality to it. The sisters that run the front are extremely nice and fun and they will do anything to make you feel at home. They make a strong Vietnamese coffee and I always come back for their avocado shakes.\nThey're pretty generous with their meat and broth is all homemade. It's a good location, across from TLK, but parking is hard from Dundas. I always take the back entrance to where the supermarket parking is. And they're open late on weekends, so it's a little healthier than pho do thi
