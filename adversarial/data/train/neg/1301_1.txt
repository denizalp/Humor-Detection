Cauliflower appetizer excellent!!  Pepperoni pizza loaded with pepperoni!  Bison burgers very flavorful!  Fish and chips excellent-  nice meaty pieces of cod!  The best thing of all was the Brussels sprouts side dish-best ever!!   Only reason not five stars was they forgot one of the items on the pizza. Service excellent!   One in our party said the black house beer was very good!!
