During my recent trip to Vegas with my husband, we decided to visit Azuza for a relaxing night of hookah! We found this place a very short distance from the strip! I must say, the customer service was better than any I've ever experienced at any hookah lounge (and I've been to many). Libby was awesome!!! The atmosphere was intimate, they serve food and alcohol, and the hookah was smooth and perfect the entire time! They stay on top of refilling drinks and changing out coals, to maintain your excellent smoking experience! I definitely enjoyed Azuza and will be returning when I visit Las Vegas again!
