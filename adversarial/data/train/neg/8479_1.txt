Don't ever get doors installed here they don't know what they are doing and rude when you question them.  First of all they sent the wrong guy to my house to measure my door so had to wait another 2 weeks for the right guy to come.  When the guy finally came out to measure my doors I had wait for them to special order the doors which initially they told me it was going to take about 3 weeks.  3 weeks later I called and they told me it's gonna take another week and so I called a week later and they informed me it was going to be an extra 2 more weeks and also were very impolite about it.  So I had enough and had to cancel my door all together and go somewhere else.  Almost 2 months wasted and a horrible experience I wouldn't recommend these guys at all.
