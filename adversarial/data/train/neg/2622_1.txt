My review is for the rocky river location. I paid a lot of money to get my hair cut. Something pretty simple, a little longer than shoulder length cut, but i wanted it done well so i booked an appointment here.  I showed a picture of how i wanted it styled (basically wavey with some volumizer in the front) because i had an event to go to afterwards.  My cut and style was maybe 12 minutes long total. Total rip off. I would not recommend coming here to get your hair cut or styled.
