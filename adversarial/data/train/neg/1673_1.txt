Fantastic meal with my son tonight. Super authentic.  Our server, Shin, totally took care of us. There was a big group about to order and she made sure our check got in the kitchen quickly. She also recommended the Thai style pad Thai over the sweet Americanized version. My son, who can be quite picky, loved it!!
