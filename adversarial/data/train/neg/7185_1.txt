This place is pretty good.  We heard a lot about it and finally decided to check it out.  I got the grilled chicken cob salad, deep fried mac n cheese a burger.  The food was great but I'm not sure what happened with our Bloody Mary.  We got charged for the wrong one and didn't even get what it was supposed to come with (beef stick).  Over all it was a good experience tho.
