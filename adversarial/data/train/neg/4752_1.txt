I purchased my truck from Heath and Shad (like the fish :-) ). Wonderful experience! Text messages I sent at all hours of the day and night, were answered. I went to All Autos Direct first, then on to a dozen other dealers and many other vehicles. Other dealerships would only deal in person or on the phone. With what I do for a living and my work hours, texting and email was the only way that worked for me. I sent pictures of my trade in, I was given an honest, out the door price, before I even test drove it! Not one other dealer would do that for me! I will say this, if you are looking for a dealer that will bargain, dont bother trying at All Autos. They offer you their best price to everyone, so dont need to bargain. As mentioned before, I dealt with a dozen other dealerships, comparing the same vehicle.....the closest anyone came was $6,000 above, what I payed for mine! When I told one dealer what I was paying for my truck he said \"you better buy that quick\", so I did. Heath was honest, didnt just tell me what he thought I wanted to hear! Would I buy another vehicle from Heath or Shad? Heck yeah I will. Thanks guy's.
