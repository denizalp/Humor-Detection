I try not to go to these places (mexican grocery store) b\/c everything smells and looks sooooo good and it is not good for my diet. My bf ordered a taco salad and it looked so frigggin good. He said it was ok. I ordered teh menudo and I'd never order that again. It was horrible. However i will not base my review soley on their menudo. I do go there to buy baked toastadas. You know how you can buy corn tortillas either regular or crunchy.... the crunchy ones are fried... but this place sells BAKED tostadas caseras. 2 for 100 calories. Cant' beat it as we use that as chips in my house to save on calories and still get the crunch. They sell great looking meat\/fish\/etc. including sweet delectibles - emanadas de pina ,  pumpkin, apple, vanilla, bollios, etc. This is the closest mexican food groc near me but If i had to choose - id pick el super over this place anyday.
