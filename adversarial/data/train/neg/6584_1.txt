Went here last night and used the convenience of yelp reservations in reserving a table for 4. Been here b4 for their amazing brunch but was my first time trying for dinner. I started off w a glass of prosecco which comes in an individual orange small bottle which reminded me of veuve champagne. And as appetizers, we got the shrimp cocktail and the short rib bruschetta. The shrimp cocktail came w 4 jumbo tiger shrimp which was perfect for the 4 of us. The short rib bruschetta was amazing!! 4 pieces of bruschetta topped with hearty portions of short ribs. It was soooo good!! Will definitely have to come here again for this paired w wine. For my entree, I got the shrimp fra diavolo which has jumbo shrimp, linguine, white wine, red pepper, Calabrian chilies, garlic and crushed tomatoes which gave it a spicy kick. It was good but wasn't amazing... the sauce was a little bland but was decent enough to eat. Next time will definitely try the short ribs or scallops instead. My husband got the chicken Marsala and our two friends got the Nook spiced airline chicken and the cowboy ribeye. From what I could see and a little taste of everyone's dishes, everything was amazing!!! My husband's chicken Marsala was to die for!! The sauce and chicken was cooked to perfection!!! Yum!! And our server was perfect!! Will definitely come back!!!
