I like this store. Yes I end up spending too much every time I am here however recently I needed a thank you gift for the hospital where my father was and I purchased a beautiful three tier platter which I thought looked great and offered a lot of  options for everyone to grab a snack at hospital. The people are nice and the product is delicious.
