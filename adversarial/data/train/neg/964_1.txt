I don't understand how this show could be rated less than 4 stars, but I guess you can't please everyone.  I agree with another reviewer, you have to like musicals and 80's rock to really enjoy it.\n\nThe show was awesome and worth every penny.  We sat in section 1, row N close to the isle which was perfect.
