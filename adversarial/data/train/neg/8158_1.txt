OK.  Now were talkin'.  The food here is yummie-delicious.  I had 2 quesadillas-one w\/chicken and one w\/mushrooms.  What a delightful surprise-especially the mushroom.  Everyone loves my special mushroom dishes and this one at La Palapa is just a different taste profile and better than mine.  A friend of mine had the mole-she is an excellent cook and loved the mole.  Another friend had chorizo quesadillas and also had great appreciation for his dish.  We also had the watermellon juice which I believe was special for the day.  I've only had this concoction in Soho in NYC (much more $) and this libation equally good and in prettier glass. \nAnd the price-forget about it-downright cheap.  Can't wait to return and have the dessert.  I love flan and I'll bet theirs' is excellent.  I was there on Th. afternoon and 2 other tables were taken-so you should be able to find accomodations.  I couldn't be happier to have this place in my neighborhood-never leave!!
