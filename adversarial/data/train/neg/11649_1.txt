I have ordered Pad Thai maybe 5 or 6 times in a row. Unfortunately, the consistency is not happening. Three out of the five times, it was outstanding. The other two times is was just OK. I don't understand why it isn't outstanding every time - is it because of the different chefs? But shouldn't they train the chefs so there is just one way to cook it?\nConsistency should be the key.
