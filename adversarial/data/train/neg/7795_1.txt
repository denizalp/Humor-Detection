Really love sonic, especially for ice cream dates with my son.  Love this location, staff is friendly and they do t disappoint.  However,my 3 star review is because all the teens that feel that every other word needs to be an F-Bomb.  Seriously, my 3 year old doesnt need to hear that! Bummer, because I really do like sonic a lot!
