I have been to many taco joints and Mexican restaurants in Henderson Nevada and Las Vegas and I must admit  that even though I live in Henderson, I will take and make the journey of pure joy to Juan's Flaming Fajita.  Our waiter was excellent and was always there to fulfill our hankering for some seriously awesome street tacos.   By the way, they have happy hour specials on a Saturday which was a nice surprise.   Truly fantastic eats and beverages.  Awesome wait staff.  I will never be able to complain about driving for 25 minutes for awesome eats and drinks.
