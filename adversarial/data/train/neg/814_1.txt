Great gym! People are very focused and on the mission to workout. Lots of people are in amazing shape, that is very motivating. There are a lot of people who you can ask for advice, most people know what are they doing. \n\nIf you need more then just advice, then get a trainer. I had very positive experience with Gregg Block. He is an amazing, sweet, great, open-minded, and has very nice positive energy.
