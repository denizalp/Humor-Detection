I am super unhappy with this place. First of all they charge $75 up front even though my copay was only $35. I did the online checkin and when I got there for my appointment there was only a few cars in the parking lot. They put me in a room right away took my vitals and did a strep test and then I waited 45 minutes  to see the doctor. I wish I had checked the reviews before I got here. I was running a fever and very ache and sitting on that uncomfortable bed with the AC blowing on me all that time could not have helped my condition. The big selling point  of the online check in is so you can comfortably wait at home so it makes no sense to have you come in and wait all this time or and the best part is it is a virus so they can't do anything but just for the hell of it they gave me an antibiotic script incase I don't get better
