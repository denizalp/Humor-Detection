The food was just ok but not impressive. Environment is great and I like I can see the chefs cooking. The servant was trying to be polite but I can tell his unpleasant smile while we were trying to decide what other foods we can get since they ran out of clam and noodles. The manager stopped by our tables twice to check, which I really appreciate!
