Hondatronics is James Bean, owner and mechanic-in-charge.  His mechanics are good guys, but James is the brain of the place. His wife in the office will disagree.\n\n I have been going to James for five years with my 96 Accord. He is consistently fast, honest and straight up about what my car needs and what it doesn't need.  I have never felt hustled or pressured to buy service I didn't need.  When the repair is done, he takes me out into the shop and shows me the parts removed. This is old-school honesty and integrity that in my opinion is very rare.\n\nHe has told me how to go on-line to find used parts, rather than soaking me for an over-priced OEM part. I like that.\n\nIt is a family-owned and run business.  James is there for every single repair. I trust him. Period.
