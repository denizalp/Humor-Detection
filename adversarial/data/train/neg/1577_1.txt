I am biased and not in a good way, as in I am past the clubbing age I guess. This is definitely a club and not a lounge. My friends wanted to check it out, so after hanging out next door at All American Pub, we went next door. I was behind my friends by about 3 mins and they somehow got in with the speed of light. I found myself staring at a line of mostly dudes, standing by a velvet rope. All I can say is \"No Thank You\". The bouncer was nice enough to wave at me and getting me in, and I am sure being a girl was the reason. \nThe place was nice, that is if I could really see. I think I needed a night vision goggles just to find my friends. And the music was really really loud, so I guess that meant they have a great sound system. In order to take a break for my ears and allow my eyes to see, one could go out to the patio, but then you will be subjected to endless cigarette smoke because it isn't a big patio. By the way, the crowd is pretty young, when will they learn that smoke kills?!\nSo yes, it was probably a hip place, and it gives people an alternative to be hip without going uptown, but I don't think I will be a frequent patron.
