Everything on the menu is Halal. The restaurant menu has changed and pork is no longer on the menu.\n\nI had the roti canai, soft flaky bread with a piece of chicken and potatoes. Subtle yet traditional Malaysian flavours.\n\nThe satay chicken was juicy and tasty. The beef was on the tougher side. The peanut sauce was excellent and home made!!\n\nI wish I could have eaten all the meat of the young coconut.\n\nNice ambience and excellent service.\n\nWill definitely go again!
