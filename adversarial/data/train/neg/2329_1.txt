To be straight to the point: excellent service, delicious food, and very reasonable prices.\n\nExcellent service: food was prepared within 5-10 minutes after placing our order. They will shout out your order, so pay attention.\n\nDelicious food: we ordered some of the more famous items on their menu - the soft-shell crab sandwich, lobster roll, \"The FOB\", and a few others. It's extremely difficult for me to identify which one was \"the best\". All I can recommend is for you and friends to order different ones to sample.\n\nReasonable prices: considering this is seafood, and considering that seafood is a rather premium dish item (e.g. seasonal, not constant like beef or chicken), the menu prices are extremely reasonable.\n\nOnly minor drawback is dining space: there are roughly 6 tall seats (bar format) and 2 sets of tables that seat roughly 4\/5 each. So space is limited, but the price and food quality definitely make up for it.
