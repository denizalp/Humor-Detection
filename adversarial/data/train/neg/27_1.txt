Dick's was a good time.  Probably the best thing going in the Excalibur.  Fun crowd and the waiter hammed it up with my mom, wife, and 14 year old son.  It is crude?  Yes!  Is there a lot of sexual innuendo?  Absolutely!  Will there be a bachelor\/ette party or something similar going on.  For Sure!\n\nIt is a loud place, so not the best for chit chat.  Food quality was better than I expected, but you do pay a premium for the antics.
