I can't say enough good things about Deana. Over the last five years, we've moved quite a lot and I never got a chance to find that hairstylist I love - well, not anymore, Deana is incredible. So personable, fun and passionate about all things hair-related. I'm always hesitant to try new things with my hair, but Deana has never led me wrong and I leave always loving my hair, plus get lots of complements. I would recommend her to anyone, and already have!
