Although this location is not the closest to my home, I happened to shop here once in a while.  It is just as good as any other Smith's I've shopped at which is a good thing.  Friendly and fast customer service in the meat department and the marinated carne asada (when cooked at home) was good. Not as tender as I had hoped, but seasoned nicely.  The Smith's phone app has always worked for me and the stores have always had enough of the Friday Freebies.  The layout is clean and I can typically find what I'm looking for.  If you synchronize (choose a store location within the app)  the phone app with the Smith's you are actually shopping in, it will help you locate items by using the search protocol!  That feature has come in handy for me on quite a few occasions as not all Smith's are alike when it comes to said floor plan.
