I went with my 5 year old son and we ended up leaving after awhile. It's indoors, warehouse feel to it. It was a hot summer day and this place as no air conditioning, we got really hot after an hour and had to leave. The staff is nice. It was okay. If I go back to Montreal I'd skip this. This however might  be a fun team building activity or older kids but not a great 5 year old activity.
