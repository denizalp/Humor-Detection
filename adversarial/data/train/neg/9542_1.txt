I selected Adobe after observing 6 schools. I found it to be the perfect blend of homey, warmth and focus. I wanted my daughter to feel the freedom to choose her work all day. This staff is very strong, and it stems from their superb leader, Mrs. Root. My kid comes home happy every day and can't wait to go back! My second child will attend here as well. My 4 year old has such confidence and I'm certain it's the Montessori style education that has instilled this in her. I have referred several friends to Adobe and will keep on singing their praises.
