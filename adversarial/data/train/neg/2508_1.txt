I really really want to like Hot Taco. Charlotte really needs a good Mexican restaurant. On the plus side I love their chips and the salsa is pretty good. I also liked the Margarita. It was a simple Margarita but not too sweet or sour. Unfortunately the rest of the meal was disappointing. The verde sauce is way too sour and the ingredients in the Chimichanga were bland. My hope is that it is a new restaurant and they will improve over time.
