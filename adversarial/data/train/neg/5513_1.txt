I love this location. I go to Star each year for my gardening needs. I have gotten fruit trees and vegetable plants other places in town and never had the same experience as here. The fruit trees we planted from Star are very lush with leaves and the apple tree already has blossoms on it after just 1 year. They do offer and return or exchange on all trees that don't take within a certain time period. \nMy vegetable garden is thriving I will never get my pepper pr tomato plants anywhere else! They have an expert out in the garden area ready to answer any questions you might have about planting. \nThe store inside is very neat and clean. They do offer a %10 senior discount on certain days. They have wagons and flatbeds for you to round up your goodies with too.
