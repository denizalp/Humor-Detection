Let's start of with the atmosphere was beautiful , the service was decent because the place is new the servers seemed kinda lost at some points. \n\nThe food was overall good. I ordered the Smokey burger, and my friend ordered the mushroom risotto we felt the food lack on seasoning especially the mushroom risotto though the fried Calamari we one of the best I have had. \n\nIf Cafe Hollander improves on the seasoning and minor errors with the food they can reach for more stars I'll be happy to come back and try it again
