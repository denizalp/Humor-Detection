Seriously so impressed with IMW's customer service, we had the nicest guy named Jaimie come down to fix our water meter. Our landlord has not fixed our basement's leak for about 6 months now and we thought that Jaimie was here to fix the leak. He politely explained that he wasn't there to fix the leak but that he could try to patch it up for us until we got the plumber. Jaimie stayed at the house for extra amount of time patching up our leak with tools from his truck and patiently explained exactly what was going on in the house. It's so nice to see a company with really sincerely concerned and kind employees
