Classic free thing to do in Las Vegas.  They play the same classic songs.  Andrea Bocelli, if you don't know who he is, you will by the time the show ends.  Expensive show to hold for free but a good attraction for the Bellagio.  I prefer to watch it at night in the spring or in the fall.  Walk around and have fun.
