This place has a cottage feel to it with glittery curtains available at some booths. The service isnt the best tbh. Communication isn't clear but they make up for it with the exceptional food portions and quality of food which is amazing \nI had their manchurian chicken w gravy and manchurian fried rice w chicken. Came to $20 for me and my friend but I went home with enough food to feed two more! \nReally do get bang for your buck here
