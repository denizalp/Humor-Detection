I stopped in here the other day.  A couple of good things, the staff as super super nice.  But it was really busy, and they were short staffed so it took awhile to get help.\nWhen I did get help it was nice.\n\nThey also didn't have what I was looking for in my size.  Go figure.  But I'd go back...comfy shoes is where it's at...  ha ha.
