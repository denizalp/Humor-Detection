Environment inside of this place is cute with a modern twist. Big leather sofas with Scrabble, Chess, etc. the waffles were delicious and the presentation was of the food was simple and elegant. The smoothies were \"eh\", kind of like a slushee. They did have rising star coffee  which was delicious! Half of the store was also a Vapor Pen store.
