Probably the closest thing to my mum's homemade dolmades, but hers are still so much better. I purposely go to Mediterranean restaurants to find one that compares to hers, and this is as close as it gets. I've never had any with a dipping sauce before, and this one had one. It actually made it yummier. \n\nThe chicken tagine was very good, even though a bit on the small side. \n\nThe environment is very warm, dimly lit. Service staff is exceptional. Thank you for being so kind!\n\nI'd go back again.
