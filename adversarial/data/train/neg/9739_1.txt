Kinda odd place to dine since I'm a local here with no habit of gambling, and I have no business coming to LV down town... but wow, I have to say, this is the place you can come to get the great lunch\/dinner for affordable price! I had a bowl of tomato soup and I splitted goat cheese chicken pizza. Bill was no more than $25 I believe... and I felt like I was at spago! Soup was simple and perfect, not too acidic and basil played nice side kick to it. Pizza had so much flavor, I rubbed my tongue many times just to taste everything in my mouth. Very satisfying. My friend ordered a plate of lasagne and it was also out of this world too. Great ambience, not too crowded, and it stays open at weird time (like 3pm where everywhere else closes down). Highly recommended!!
