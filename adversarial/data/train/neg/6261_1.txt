I broke my back a few years ago and have had multiple surgeries, I have hardware in my back and my job is very hard on my back, neck and shoulders. Had a massage done by Jen. WoW! She was absolutely amazing! She was very aware of my metal and sure to be careful around the 10.5in metal rods placed there, while still working out the scar tissue and muscles surround it. Everything from my neck down feels so loose and so much better! I highly recommend Jen. I will most definitely be back! Thanks Jen and the friendly staff!
