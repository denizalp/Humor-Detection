Pretty decent suite that's worth the money.  Both times, I stayed at one of their THE Suites.  Living room, bedroom, nice bathroom, and a 1\/2 bath by the front door.  The overall service (lobby, room, etc.) was not bad.  The rooms were clean and well stocked with everything you need.  Pretty cushy place.  Since Mandalay is at the far end of The Strip, the price here is pretty good compared to other suites in other hotels especially considering how nice Mandalay's pools are.\n\nThey did mishandle a couple of things which made me hesitate to give them a full 5 stars.  The towels were old and scratchy...both times.  The TV (while big) was useless due to the subpar cable in the room.  Why advertise you have an HD flatscreen when you have no HD channels?  We ordered the room with a pull-out sofa sleeper in the living room (which was suppose to be standard).  But the sofa we got wasn't a sleeper so we just sort of had to make due sleeping on the sofa for 2 nights.  \n\nOne morning we got a wake up call at 8am.  That really SUCKED considering we went to bed at 5am.  However, the call we actually requested for 10am never came causing us to oversleep and miss a poker tournament.  \n\nSo, overall, it's a nice hotel but their attention to detail needs some work before it can truly compete with the top-end 5-star hotels.
