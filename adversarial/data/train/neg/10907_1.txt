Got a small coffee with cream and sugar. It tastes like bitter horrible sadness... got a chocolate donut and they just threw it I. The bag with zero protection.... just straight in the bag without the protective or napkin.... weird experience... said to have wasted money on this gross little coffee... bathrooms are sparkling clean though.
