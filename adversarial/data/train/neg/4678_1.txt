Wow: If this is what this chain is all about, I'd have been here years ago! First visit was today for breakfast, and we had rather low expectations (been to so many consistently poor locations like Arrowhead Kneaders; Chompies; First Watch; Fired Pie etc). \nHowever; we had fresh eggs\/tasty potatoes; amazing toast; great jam with no high fructose corn syrup; sea salt\/ground pepper blend... even smiling employees! While this management style may be considered \"old school\", it's nice to have a place that gives a shart that we can call our regular haunt now. Well done you guys :-)
