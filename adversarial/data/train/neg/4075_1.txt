Ordered the pad Thai spice level 8 and the waitress said they are known for their spice. It tasted very mild,weak and a little greasy. Don't say you're spicy if your not . Would have been nice to have spices on the table. Took too long for the check and they were more worried about cleaning the table then doing the check.
