RUDE RUDE RUDE. My husband was checking into a weekly when we were checking out from here. I had two large trash bags and a sleepy 2 year old. The lady gave me a late checkout really nice but I called to see if someone could help with my bags and I would have tipped. But he was rude and said sounds like I have a personal problem. Like r u serious now my son and me have to be in the heat waiting instead of by the front desk just because they wouldn't help with my bags. DONT STAY HERE THEY HAVE ROACHS AND DRUG ADDICTS ARE EVERYWHERE NOT TO MENTION PIMPS AND PROSTITUTION!!!! Fuck you motel 6!!!! You could have said no respectfully but you had to treat someone with a kid like dirt.
