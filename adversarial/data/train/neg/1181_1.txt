Food: I loved everything we ordered, we were looking for late night food and this place was perfect. I had the Motley q sand which, which is not just any pulled pork sandwich, it was loaded with tender chunks if meat that melted in your mouth with a fun slaw, awesome sauce, and melted wonderful cheddar on a toasted pretzel bun. Yum! Served with 4 kinds of fries, all of them amazing.\n\nAmbiance: what you would expect from Guy, it had personality, not formal, and the wait staff were coordinated, but not in a kitschy way.\n\nservice: and this is why I gave them a 3 star rating was spotty at best. It took 20 minutes to get drinks, then easily took 30 minutes to get our check after they took our plates. Very strange, but the back up staff kept up with refills, so that was nice.
