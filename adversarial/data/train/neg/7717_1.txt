Amazing service and the quality of food is fantastic as well. I ventured here with my boyfriend at 10:30pm after a stressful endeavor dealing with Air Canada at the airport...  We were greeted warmly and were laughing with the hostess about the shenanigans that brought us in. Highly recommend both the nachitos (with chicken) and the shrimp tacos!!
