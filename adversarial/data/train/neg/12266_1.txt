I've gone to Eva Nails & Spa for the last month or so to get my nails filled. It's a nice little place. They offered me water every time I'm there.  \nAs for my nails, they always come out looking great. I get the white tips with pink polish on top. I can usually go about 2 1\/2-3 weeks between fills. They know exactly what I want and how I like my nails. I do get annoyed that one of the nail tech's son (about 1-2years old) runs around the shop. He snuck up and took off with my phone one day and then screamed when they took it away. Another time he tried to get it but I was able to get to it before him. It's a little annoying they have him running around when customers are there. He plays with the stuff on the other tables and gets into things. I think they should either not bring him, or hire a sitter.
