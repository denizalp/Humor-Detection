I love this place for brunch \n\nGreat patio and service  \n\nFun presentation \n\nFresh squeezed juice for mimosas\n\nThey have great bloody Mary's \n\nChocolate bacon is a fun treat. \n\nWe went there one time and our son asked for no onions. The waitress noticed his omelette had onions and brought us a gift certificate for next time \n\nThe portions are huge but the food is he great. They have fruit on a skewer and the pineapple is always sweet \n\nIf you come on a Sunday head over early you will have a wait. It's worth it but a wait :)
