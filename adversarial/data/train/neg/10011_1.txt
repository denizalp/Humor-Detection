We have been customers of Queen Bee Bakery for quite some time now. My 7 year old daughter absolutely loves going to Queen Bee. I thought it would be great for us to order a cake from here since she loves it so much. On Sept 3rd, 2016 I placed an order for a cake for Sept 17th, 2016 (2 full weeks ahead as requested by the bakery). One of the bakery employees sat with us at a table and discussed the details of the cake order with me. We agreed on an ESTIMATE price of $60 for a 9 inch cake. I gave her my card and she charged me a deposit of $30.06 (tax included is guess). We also requested that my daughter have a ability to decorate a few cupcakes on the day of her party Sept 17th, 2016. We were told by the same employee that that might be very possible and that she would have the baker contact us to confirm the details of that request. She never told us of the possibility of a charge for a 15 minute cupcake decorating experience. We ordered the cake in good faith while we waited for word back from the baker. On Sept 9th, 2016 I received a call from the baker\/owner (whom repeatedly mispronounced my name). From the start of our conversation I felt that she was talking over me and not letting me explain the request I had for my daughter's cake decorating experience. I was fine with her quoting me $60 for the cake. The conversation went south when she wanted to charge me $25 per hour to have my daughter decorate a few cupcakes. I was very annoyed because we were under the impression that this experience would be comp'd. I never completed my purchase with Queens Bee and never went back for the cake. I just felt that the owner was being very rude to me over the phone. She made me feel as if I was bothering her bc she was too busy for the little guy. Very disappointed in Queen Bee.
