I write this as I sip peppermint-ginger tea in an attempt to settle my stomach after eating at Mai Thai II this evening. I used to really like this place, but it seems to keep going downhill. \n\nI was never a fan of the ambience in the restaurant, so I almost always order takeout. The place is usually pretty quiet because it's always nearly empty, and the music they play is designed to put you to sleep or take you back a few decades, depending on the day. I always found the booths really uncomfortable too; the seats really lack support and the tables aren't wide enough. \n\nThe food is wildly inconsistent. I almost always order Pad Thai (yes I know I need to be more adventurous), so I can tell you exactly how inconsistent it is. Some days it's amazing, and other days I've been tempted to chuck it in the trash. Sometimes a \"spicy level\" 2 will burn your eyebrows off, and other times it's barely noticeable. Sometimes my takeout container is so full it's nearly popping open, other times it's not. And speaking of the container, it's a thin flimsy plastic one that makes me wonder how much is leaching right into my food...
