Overall, I really like it here! It's a fun atmosphere with live music every night which is cool. It had a nice set up w booths for seating. Service was fast and friendly. They have great deals for pitchers and drinks. I love the back where they have fooseball and pool tables which they charge by hour about 10 dollars per table.   It has a diveish feel, and very old fashioned look to it. Only cons really were they lost out bill which took about ten  to refund it and that when we got the bill they couldn't split it because it was busy, ok. Then the owner refused to let us use cards to pay \"because it charges them twice\". So he'd rather we use the cash machine which I charges us. Hmm. Kinda annoying took us about  half hour to pay because he refused to be charged by using a card and wanted us to be when he lost the bill in the first place.
